That's all you 've got, and you keep riding that horse whether it makes the 
difference or not. I maintain that, though I'm sure being there would add 
to my knowledge of the situation and improve my perspective, it wouldn't 
completely invalidate or necessarily change my current opinion.

a) You get flagged, whether through the help of your guild, a pickup group 
or a friend's guild. Having trouble with *anyone* getting flagged? Work on 
levelling up some more and improving your gear, whatever it takes, rather 
than complain because the game is too hard.

b) You commit a portion of your time (30% - 40% would be more than 
reasonable) to helping guildmates also get through the trials. The rest of 
your time can be spent levelling to your heart's content, making you an 
even bigger help to others getting through.

The fact that not everyone who has gotten flagged has done it under the 
best of circumstances is what makes it hard for me to accept the claim that 
the problem is the game itself, and not a group comprised of some people 
who are lacking in some qualities necessary for a strong and successful 
guild.

No matter. I've said all I have to say, and maintain my opinion. I will, 
however, try to keep an open mind about it. Believe it or not, I have no 
trouble at all admitting when I am wrong. I just am not convinced that is 
the case here at this point.

I suppose it is a moot point here, since the trial requirements will be 
removed long before I ever reach the point of needing to worry about them.
