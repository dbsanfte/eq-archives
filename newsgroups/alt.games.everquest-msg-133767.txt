If the other answers don't work you can try /consenting someone who seems to
be trustworthy to bring your corpse to you.  Be prepared to part with some
plat though, in payment (often refused by people, but you gotta offer to be
polite).

If you died in some weird place you can try going to the zone line and
typing /corpse.  I THINK some patch message a while ago said that it might
work.  At the very least you'll know if your corpse still exists ("too far
away" message).

If you have another character that's close to being able to survive down
there, /consent that character then log him on...it might be a problem with
your ini/opt files for your level 13 character.
