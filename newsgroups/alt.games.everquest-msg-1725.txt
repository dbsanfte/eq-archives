You have summed this up quite well sir.  You need not agree with
everything he says, or even like him really, to respect him or any other
poster here.  There is a big difference between agreeing with and
respecting an opinion.  The troll cavalcade on the other hand can spout
what they will, there is no respecting a person with so little reason to
live that they make poking Bizbee a hobby to fill their lives with.  I
mean at least pick on someone who is bothered by it, Biz doesn't care
what an idiot has to say about him, that much is clear.
