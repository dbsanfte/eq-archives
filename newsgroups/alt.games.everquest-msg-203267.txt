   I've wondered the exact same thing.  I have concluded that the
answer is, regrettably, yes.  While there a few who won't group with
Crabs Hurtz under any circumstances, the vast majority will do so if
they are in a group that is short one member, and Crabs is invited by
the GL.  Similarily, if they want a SoW, and Poopfinger the shaman is
willing to give one, they will hid any disdain they might feel.  And
while Llewelore might never give his hand me downs to a young
Killthemall, his peer Theslayer very well might.
