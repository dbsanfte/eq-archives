Let's go with that number (360 vendors in Bazaar).  There are 44 live
servers.  Let's remove FV from the mix because those numbers will not hold
for FV.  Having never played on one of the Zeks, I will assume that the
numbers hold for them (but I doubt it).  That means we have 360 times 41
vendors online, or 14760 vendors.  That's still 85k plus players online.
Now, my guess, based on the 3 servers I did look at, is that there are more
loke 250 vendors and 100 or so others in the Bazaar at any time, or,
slightly over 10k vendors among all the servers.

You are right.  90k playes online at one time.  EQ is dead.
