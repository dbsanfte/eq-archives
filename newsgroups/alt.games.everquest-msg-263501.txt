The problem is that the world of EQ2 is so much more vast than CoH's, I 
can't speak with much authority about anything other than my limited 
experience on just one of the many continents, and then only about 40% of 
that continent as a level 20 in a level 50 world.

From what I have seen, however, there is a lot of travel in EQ2 and I think 
most people will find the balance pretty comfortable.  There are mass 
transit options for some portions, including griffins that will transport 
you to designated stations across the main hunting zones, and dock bells 
that you can ring to arrange instantaneous transporation to the docks of any 
of the small villages or newbie hunting grounds surrounding the main cities. 
You will still have to run around a lot inside the main cities and across 
the big hunting zones. Every citizen gets an automatic Gate to Home ability 
which has a one-hour timer on it, so that at the end of a long hunt you can 
easily get back home and sell off, etc., but that's it. No recall, no 
teleport, no other gating, at least none that I've seen (and I make spells 
as my profession and currently manage several hundred).

The big difference here is that in CoH, you spent all your time flying past 
the same offices, abandoned warehouses and so on, the travel itself wasn't 
very interesting. In EQ2 there's a LOT to see and zones have their own 
distinct identity worth experiencing. The travel itself is part of the 
adventure. I still find it a compelling trip and even though I've taken a 
previous character to level 20 Mystic, I'm playing an alt now who is level 
18 and I just started the Antonica Tour quest agaom last night, a quest that 
asks for nothing more than running to all corners of Antonica and 
"discovering" them, I like the journey that much.
