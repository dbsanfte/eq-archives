Hi Omiin

Am I understanding you correctly regarding the 3rd and 4th views.

3rd: if you set the camera to look at your right arm, say. And say you
are facing directly North. If you turn your body 90% so that it will
face East, the camera will pan around so that it still looks at your
right arm?

4th: if you set the camera to look at your right arm, say. And say you
are facing directly North. If you turn your body 90% so that it will
face East, the camera will not pan around and will now be looking at
your face?

the reason i ask these dumb questions without figuring it out for
myself is that ever since i have owned EQ, the 3rd & 4th camera views
do exactly the same thing: they both behave in the way you described
your 4th camera view.

if i can get the 3rd view you describe, it would tremendously improve
my bard swarm kiting.

i wonder why my 3rd view doesnt work properly. maybe because i have
remapped my movement keys over to the numeric keypad /boggle.

TIA
