That should be just 'read'. I'd have to read them to reread them. I just 
skimmed a few bits to get the gist.

Well I'm sure the Rockefellers and Kennedy's (who have no political 
influence right? -sarcasm-) would let that go through uncontested...

The final consumption concept is pretty normal in sales tax now, that's 
what input tax credits are for. But input tax credits are heavily 
abusable... a millionare  never pays tax for lunch provided he eats with 
his lawyer or stockbroker (even said lawyer or stockbroker is his wife, 
and never pays tax on his trip to hawahii to visit his rental 
property...)... but the working stiffs pay 23% on each meal, and pay 23% 
tax on a bus ticket to see his parents in Detroit. etc etc etc...

In fact the clever millionaire won't own his own car, or his house 
either, they'll be business assets, rented out to the guys for chump change.

As soon as you have a concept of 'business expense tax exemption' you've 
created the means for the wealthy to avoid massive amounts of tax.
