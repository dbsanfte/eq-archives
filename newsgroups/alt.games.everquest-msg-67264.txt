I like the new models as well, however I wish everything was effected.  For
example, merchants are the old models, as are some guards, etc.  

I find the mixing of old models and new to class for some reason, it bothers me
:)  

I love the new textures though.  The sky, grass, and walls look fantastic.  I
play with the textures on high, but everything else turned off.
