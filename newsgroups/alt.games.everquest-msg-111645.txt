My favourite blonde joke at moment

NASA after many years of research and training finally managed to train two
chimps to fly the space shuttle.

Day of the launch comes and the two chimps accompanied by a blonde blast off
into space.

Once in orbit the call comes from Houston

"Monkey no.1 Do your tasks Alpha"

Off monkey no.1 goes flicking switches, adjusting orbit, and manoeuvring the
shuttle and sits back down and buckles back up.

Then from Houston

"Monkey no.2 Do your tasks Beta"

Off monkey no.2 , he gets on the arm and puts two satellites into orbit and
recovers a third faulty one for fixing and sits back down and buckles back
up.

Then from Houston

"Blond, calling Blonde"

And the blonde interrupts.. "I know I know, feed the monkeys and don't touch
anything"
