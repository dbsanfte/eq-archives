Funny thing is Cabilis might be easier on you than Neriak.  For Cab
you'd need to off lots of Kunark goblins and outcast Iksar, then a few
thousand bone chips and then start in on maybe some curscale questing. 
Neriak I'm thinking would be gruesome, either elf slaves in CB or
halflings in nek forest for starters.  Just because you "could" get your
faction up doesn't mean you'll really want to hehe.
