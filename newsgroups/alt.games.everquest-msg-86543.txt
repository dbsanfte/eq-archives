A proc is an effect that a weapon has. It is usually a direct damage to your
opponent (as if you had cast a spell), but there are other types of procs,
debuffs, AOE damage etc.
When you are fighting, each time you hit with the weapon, it has a chance of
'procing'.
Some procs dont work until you get to a certain level, before you hit this
level you will get a 'your will is not sufficient to control this weapon'
(or something) message each time the weapon should have proced.
Get yourself a coldain velium weapon, they proc from level 1 apparently, and
have a go yourself...noobie)
