Depends.  The 'gate guards', or the guards protecting the towns were
buffed up after release, to stop people from killing them, and leaving
the newbies with nowhere to run with their trains.  However, the guards
patrolling the cities are fairly low level.  The lowest looks to be ~16,
while the other (non gate) guards tend to hover around ~30.

Oh, and an aside.  Everyone and their mother is a dark elf necromancer.
Be cute and scaly!
