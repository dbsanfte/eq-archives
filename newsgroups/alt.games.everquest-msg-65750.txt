Okay, I've been playing this game for well over a year, and have an HP
Pavilion 6545C (No flames, please, I already know it's a POS.. But it's
an -affordable- POS... :) ).  Anyway, it has an Intel 82810 video chip.. and
for the 1 year+ I've been playing, everything was fine... Then bam!  Out
comes Luclin, and I can no longer play...  Things that should be
transparent, are not...  So I get blocks, trees look all funky, some text is
unreadable, etc...  Well, according to Tech Support, my video chipset is no
longer supported, and if I wish to continue to play WHAT I ALREADY HAD, I
needed to upgrade...  *sigh*  Fine...  I go out and buy a new card... Now,
since my system doesn't support AGP graphics cards (no slot), I ended up
having to settle for a TNT2 PCI 16 meg card...  And hey, all's well... I can
play, and things look much better...  So, I'm happy, once again, although
disappointed by having to spend $50 on a card I wasn't expecting to buy...

So, I play all of last night, content... Couldn't go to Luclin yet, since
nobody in my area has it... (My guess is the shops go "oooh, hot new game...
Let's by TWO copies instead of One... but let's order 50 copies of Barbie
Workshop..."  :)  But that's fine...  My druid's wolf form kicks ass, and
they actually taught us wolvies how to SIT!!  :)  Although I was a bit
annoyed at the fact that my bard was practically useless as all the songs
were screwed up... But I had confidence that they would fix it...

I log in this morning right before going to work to see if they fixed Bard
issues... new patch!  Oooh, hopefully so!  Well, according to the patch
message, the bard issues are still being worked... /em sighs in
disappointment...  Then, I see one more thing.... "The transparency issues
with the i810 have been fixed."  WTF?!?!  They told me that if I wanted to
play, I needed to upgrade!!!  Now they ARE supporting it?  /em grumbles
angrily.
