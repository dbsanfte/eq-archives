The only place I know for certain that has bread freely availably is in
kelethin, two rope-bridges from the orc lift. The merchant up against the tree
bole sells it in unlimited supply, although you might want to check if this is
"bread" or "elven bread".

You might also want to look it up at eqtraders, they have lists of trade skill
supplies by trade skill and by zone.
