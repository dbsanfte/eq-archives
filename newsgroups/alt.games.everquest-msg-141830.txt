You don't HAVE to pay taxes, for one thing.  It's damned hard to find
a legal job that pays under the table.  You could become a
'consultant' and run your own business and just not pay taxes,
although you will stand a good chance of running afoul of the
authorities.  

But you don't HAVE to pay taxes.  I have some relatives that have
never really paid taxes.  The make most of their money selling crap as
swapmeets.  On the rare occasion that one of them has to get a job,
they claim Married and as many dependents as is possible, then just
don't file at the end of the year.  And they have never been audited.

Then do something about it.  For all its many, many, MANY flaws, the
US government is still participatory.  You can jump in with both feet
and start trying to make all the changes you want.

Yeah, capitalism is great, on a very, very small scale.
Unfortunately, technology has increase the scale of everything in the
world.

On a large scale, you end up with things like the Industrial
Revolution, which for all the nice things it gave the world
technologically speaking, it also shit-hammered society.  It made a
society that was almost caste based.  You had the poor, and the
FANTASTICALLY rich.  You had business that could get away with stuff
like sweatshops where pre-teen's would work, locked in, 12 hours a
day, seven days a week for pennies a day, in some truly hellish
conditions.  And see what that got the girls at the Triangle
Shirtwaist Factory.

Read THE JUNGLE, and imagine what fun it would be to shop for cold
cuts in an unregulated capitalist society.

Capitalism works only if you assume that people, more importantly, the
people with power (ie money) are willing to do what is best for
society.  That's different from socialism in that ANYBODY can fuck up
socialism by not doing things for the greater good.  Capitalism just
reduces the number of people that will fuck things up.

There will never, ever be a 'perfect' society/government until you
make perfect people.

Yes, it was much better 100 years ago when there was nobody to ensure
that there wasn't rat feces and human fingers in your food and a
company could dump whatever waste they wanted into major waterways.

Unregulated business, ie pure Capitalism, is a Bad Thing.
