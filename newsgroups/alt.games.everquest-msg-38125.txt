Has anyone here actually been to Kerra Isle?  I was there hunting the last two
days and the whole time saw 3 people other than me.  I know its a little out of
the way, but being that unpopulated, there is no waiting for spawns or
anything.  The only tough part is keeping your faction at a level where you
aren't KOS since everything lowers your Kerra Isle faction except for a few
lower level MOB's.  The best way to do it is to do the "rat tooth" quest.  It's
pretty easy and will allow you to kill a few Kerrans before you have to do it
again.
