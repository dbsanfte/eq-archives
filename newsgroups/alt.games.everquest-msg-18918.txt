At least on Emarr, shield of the slain unicorn is pretty
much considered crap now.  You have trouble giving them
away, the delay is 40, so it's not good for raising skill or
really even attacking, in the post Kunark/Velious world. 
It's warrior only, so classes like ranger who could really
benifit from the AC on it can't use it.  There are so many
better piercing items out there now that, by the time you
have duel wield, you can generally find a better offhand
piercing weapon.
