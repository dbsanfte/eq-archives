Well, i have the arms, myself, so i guess it was.
The breast plate is the best piece so far, +20 hps, 12 ac, with minor str, con
& dex buffing.
Well worth all the hunting and scavenging.
(and it only weighs 5.0 lbs, very nice)

I had to put out a bounty on willow wisps for a burned-out lightstone, since
the market moved to the Bazaar, i just haven't seen any offers on magic
weapons. :{

Thanks for the quick replies, both of you. :}
