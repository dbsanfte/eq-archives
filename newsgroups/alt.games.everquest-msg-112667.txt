A wizard on Quellious dinged 59, got some rest, and determined that he
was going to make to through all of level 59 to become a sorcerer in one
session.  You can read the thread here:

(Yes, it wraps. Cut/paste it)

If you struggle through all the *seven!* pages of posts, you'll see how
his fellow wizards rallied together when it began to look as if he might
really pull it off.  Started some time Saturday evening. He dinged 60
this morning.  Dedicated or crazy? You be the judge. :-)
