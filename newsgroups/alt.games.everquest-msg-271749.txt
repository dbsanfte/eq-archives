I see this advise where ever I care to look. Actually I tried to get the
level 29 necro pet to proc these weapons. But it was to no avail. The
first time I did notice the pet proccing anything was with the 44 pet.
This is the first one that has its own lifetap proc and it procs the
ixiblat, kedge and walnan blades too. But until then they lack the will in
my experience.

So are you sure they do proc these weapons?
