I've been hitting the nightstalkers in PON for the last few weeks, but
since the last patch i've noticed something odd.

They seem to gain a whole bunch of hit points sometimes. My normal
routine is to charm one, make it fight another. They normally get down
to 20% together where the other will flee. When  it dies I invis and
then root dot the other.

But a few times now i've been root dotting one and it'll be at like
%12 health, I look away for a tic and when I look back it's at like
%45 lol I've never actually seen it increase, it's happened three
times so far and i'm always looking at the other box when it happens.

Anyone noticed anything like this ?

Cheers,
