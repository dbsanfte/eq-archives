Actually, a cleric that does nothing but buff,
heal and med in the mid levels is a mediocre
cleric. 

For example, once you get your third stun, you
should remap your spells anytime the puller
indicates a casting mob to have all 3 stuns up
and running. Perma-stunnage is lethal against
caster mobs and will keep the damage to your
party way down.

It's a useful, if not always foolproof technique
and every cleric should know how to use it.
