You can "expect" all you want. You can "expect" VI to make good on their
promises, just like everyone "expected" them to make good on promises made
when EQ first went live. In fact, we're all still waiting on those promises
to be fulfilled. In short, it is just another ploy by VI to screw their more
gullible customers out of even more money.
If you think that paying more money to them is going get you better service,
then I have some beachfront property in Arizona to sell you.
