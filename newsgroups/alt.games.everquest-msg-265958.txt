I think you think too much.

 Its started at 9.95$ a month now its 14.95$. I recently stopped playing EQ
but not DAOC. I dont plan to stop DAOC and 12.95$ + 14.95$ (some months I
was playing both games) , thats too much. I have to choose between the 2
games, and since I already have many characters in DAOC , I choose to stay
with that game.
