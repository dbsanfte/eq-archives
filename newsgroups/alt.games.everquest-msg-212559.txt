Which an omnipotent and omniscient God would preclude.  You cannot have 
free will, if you were created specifically with the knowledge of exactly 
what will happen to you and what all the "decisions" you will make are, 
you have been programmed to make the "decisions" you will make.  You 
cannot choose either way, you have been created to choose one specific 
way.  You think you can choose either way, but, that is not really the 
case.  From your point of view, you believe that you do have free will, 
but, in reality, you were created with a complete knowledge of exactly 
how you will decide each and every thing.  If God wanted you to "choose" 
differently, then he would have had to alter his creation such that you 
"choose" differently.  If, I really and truly have free will, and can 
make choices, then, God cannot be both omniscient and omnipotent.

Just to make sure we are working from the same definitions here:

Omniscient means to have complete knowledge of everything.

Omnipotent means to be all powerful.

If God is omniscient, then he must know everything that will occur based 
on how he creates things.  If God is omnipotent, he can create things 
exactly as he wants them created.  Therfore, if I were to believe that 
God is both, then, when the universe was created, God had complete and 
full knowledge of everything that was going to happen, and, he created it 
exactly as he wanted it.  Now, if we disagree on the meaning of those two 
words, then, that's a different discussion.
