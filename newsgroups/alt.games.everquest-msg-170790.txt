What the hell is it with you and Limbaugh?  Could I please bring up at least
one DAMN point in a debate without you doing some sort of knee-jerk "He's
got Limbaugh-cooties" reaction?  I'll make you a deal, you don't go off on
some sort of anti-limbaugh McCarthyite trip when I don't even bring up his
name, and I'll assume you may actually have something semi-intelligent to
say.  Deal?

So, I quote a more accurate number, and you revise it to something you can
argue with more easily, and then attribute it to someone who fits whatever
petty little agenda you're arguing from?  Excuse me, check please.

Oooh, yeah... the oh-so-unbiased FAIR.  Ok, now that you've got your
lying-sack-of-shit pundit, and you've assigned me mine, are we done with
measuring penis size?

Are you really that clueless?  Do you think the HM's have no idea what's
going on?  Just how many cases of STD's do you think a typical HMC has seen?
How many WESTPACs do you think the average HM1 has gone on, where half the
ship is lined up outside medical after a port call in Singapore?

Oh, and the statistics were from the CDC, IIRC.

Because, if Taras says it's so, then I should probably take his word over
people who practically specialize in STDs.  Cuz hez so smartz.

Oh, that's right, you were there, how could I have missed you.

Because I could just go online in 1989 and see for myself.

And how, exactly, is not having sex risky?

Won't be an issue since I'm not lying to them.

Ooooh, more FAIR.  I'm sooooooooooo impressed, really, I'm not being
sarcastic, honest.

You can take what you want from this post, I'm sure you'll either decide
that I'm the anti-christ, or being mind-controlled.  I really don't care.
If you wish to convince me, or anyone else for that matter, you're going to
have to seriously look at how you try to "debate," because you've failed in
a big way.
