Well, I use SuperNews and alt.net, and I know the guy that runs alt.net. 
Categorically I will state that Supernews has better retention rates, 
overall completeness, and spam control. I have compared the two, and 
although Supernews does filter posts, IME 100% of the snipped posts are 
spam. 

Then again, I obviously wouldn't know anything about Usenet. I'm just an 
ISP sysadmin who has been using it for the last eight years or so.

And no, I will not SOW Y3W D3WD!!1!
