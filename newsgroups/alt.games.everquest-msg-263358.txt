It is fun with decent graphics. Plays Diablo style (as mentioned). 
Personally, I'd rather have a Diablo game for the PPC.

You're limited from four characters without much development creativity. 
This mini-Norrath is well designed, though, with decent areas of 
exploration. Quests are well-written with good story flavor. Good soundtrack 
and effects (use mini-headphones).

PPC vs. Gameboy? I have both and would prefer GB game on a long trip. 
Buttons are less hand-cramping than stylus manipulation IMO. The GB battery 
lasts much longer than the PPCs, too. However, one looks extremely cooler 
playing games on PPC.

If you're going on a "jaunt to Europe", then the EQ game is only pocket 
change for you. :)
