I have a 65 chanter with about 40 AAs so far and I'm trying to figure
out which AAs to pursue.  My last set I invested in 3 levels of
casting subtlety, hoping that this will help me stay alive in the
harder zones.  

Anyone have any links to websites that discuss the different caster or
chanter AAs?  For example, I'm wondering how Mesmerization Mastery
could be worth 20 AAs... I'd hate to spend that and find out it
increased the length of mezzes by 5%.

TIA - Mirque - 65 chanter
