Now we're getting into the question of negative rights (which he has, in 
this case) vs. positive rights (which he does not).

For those who aren't familiar with those terms, negative rights exist on a 
"shall not interfere" basis.  They are considered inherent to the individual 
whether exercised or not, and do not obligate anyone else to provide their 
fulfillment.  These are rights of the type laid out by the constitution. 
Ie, the right to keep and bear arms does not obligate any individual, 
collective, or government to buy a gun for me.  It only means that they 
can't stop me (this is for illustrative purposes only, I'm not here to start 
a second amendment argument).  Positive rights create an obligation for 
others to supply right to you, if you cannot do so yourself (and many times, 
even if you can).  This is like the presumed right to health care.  We all 
have a negative right to health care - ie the government is not permitted to 
stop you... well, unless you're sitting in the electric chair... but in 
order for there to be a positive right, someone else must pay for those who 
are not required to pay for themselves (even if that means everyone). 
Either the taxpayers pay, or the doctors are forced to donate time and 
equipment, or a certain segment of the population or various individuals are 
billed.
