Hmm, I thought they were going to do Hard, Normal, and Easy; lost the Easy
option somewhere it seems.  Question then is, how good are they at estimating
what a given group considers "normal"?  If I come in with 6 level 30 paladins,
and you come in with a level 30 cleric, enchanter, paladin, and rogue, rogue,
rogue, do we both get the same dungeon?  I like tooling around with sub optimal
groups sometimes, but it seems to me that if I can't scale back my difficulty
level to match our capabilities this isn't going to be possible in LDoN.

I can see the converse working out; if I want a harder dungeon run than whatever
they consider "hard", I can just bring in someone 10 levels higher than the rest
of my 5 man group, then have them gate out once we get the dungeon; dialing up
the difficulty level not only by virtue of going down to 5 man but also raising
the average level a bit.  Other than someone leaving, is it possible to change
group composition after the dungeon is given but before you go in?

What if I bring a 5 man group as before, but bring along a 6th man who's much
Lower level, and then have him gate out; does that make the dungeon easier
(average level of group is lower) or harder (total number of levels in the group
is higher)

Guess what I'm asking is how the difficulty selection process is handled; total
levels, average level, lowest level in group, highest level in group, mean level
of group; are classes considered, is there an algorithm for class compatibility,
so on and so forth.

Knowing the work of SOE thus far, my guess is that the difficulty will be based
on total number of levels in the group with no regard for class, and the bar
will be set so that "normal" dungeons will assume gear from NTOV while "hard"
dungeons will assume you are all dressed in PoT gear... even if the whole party
is level 20.
