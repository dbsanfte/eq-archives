When I copy from a dictionary, I cite.  When I don't copy from a
dictionary, I don't cite.  If you will notice, the above is not cited.
Ergo, it wasn't copied from a dictionary.

An insinuation is an accusation, exactly as a rose is a flower.  But
you do not call all flowers roses, just as you do not call all
accusations insinuations.

Above, you stated "Please dont (sic) copy from [the] dictionary.".
That is an insinuation, not an accusation.  You insinuated, i.e.,
intimated or suggested *without* actually accusing that I had done so.
Now, *this* is the dictionary definition of insinuation (M-W):

Main Entry: in�sin�u�a�tion
Pronunciation: (")in-"sin-y&-'wA-sh&n
Function: noun
Date: 1526
1 : the act or process of insinuating
2 : something that is insinuated; especially : a sly, subtle, and
usually derogatory utterance.

Thesaurus equivalents:

Synonyms innuendo, insinuendo
Related Word hint, hinting, implication, implying, intimation,
suggestion; animadversion, aspersion, reflection; ascription,
imputation.

As you can see from the above, your opinion that "... an insinuation
is just an accusation from someone either (usually) too weak to say
what they mean explicitely (sic)..." is an incorrect one.  Further,
curious thing, you insinuated that I quoted from the dictionary for my
description of insinuation.  Shall we take that to mean that *you* are
"too weak to say what you mean explicitly"?

As to how I think insinuation is different from accusation (by the
way, you *really* need to learn when to use quotes around a word;
different does not get quoted as you did), this pretty much covers it:
An insinuation is a hidden accusation.

I suggest you look up the root word "insinuate".  You *really* need to
improve your grasp of the subtleties of the English language.
