Not much help, I'm afraid...but I wouldn't bother downgrading to DX7.0a.
Lots of people, including me, have had no problems at all with DX8.  I'm
also using an Athlon (700) with a GeForce2 (MX) video card.

My only suggestion is to temporarily move all INI and OPT files into a
different folder and restart EQ to get back to the totally default options.

Uh, there's also one for the video card, but for the life of me I can't
remember its name...and I don't think it's covered by the INI/OPT thing I
just mentioned.
