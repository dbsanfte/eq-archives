if we've come to the point where its accepted that no one knows, i get to at
least make a guess . .

aren't there words of dissolution and words of disillusion? perhaps from
here you can tack on "-ment" and figure out what's going on . .


not to be mean or anything, but they are actually very different things,
whereas dissolution and dissolutionment are the same . . .  disillusionment
is probably what you're going for


i guess you might just want to check another site that lists research
components
