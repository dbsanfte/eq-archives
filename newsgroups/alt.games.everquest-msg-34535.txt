    Wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole. I'm a results-oriented person,
so being on a server where any mention of ooc issues to increase group
efficiency would drive me batty. My idea of relaxation isn't putting up with
group errors while being forced to communicate in a stilted manner.
Injecting roleplay into regular gaming is fun, but forcing it to be the norm
wouldn't be for me.
