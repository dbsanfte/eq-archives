No, the druid at the ring they are suggesting you sell to isn't really
a druid. He's on beta neutral faction (as are the merchants at all
druid rings afaik) which means he'll pretty much deal with anyone (as
long as you haven't fubar'ed your beta neutral faction some bizarre
way - I think everyone is "born" indifferent to those guys.) The only
people on the whole continent of Faydwar my necro can get to buy from
or sell to her are the bbm and sf druid ring merchants. As a plus, if
you kill in the Warrens long enough, you will eventually become
non-KOS to merchants and guards in Paniel and will be able to bank and
sell there; killing kobolds gives a positive faction hit for both
Paniel and Erudin. And once you outgrow the Warrens, Stonebrundt Mtns.
are quite nice for soloing classes.
