Here's what the general shaman buffs do:

Focus: HP, STR, DEX
Boar: STA
Diaku: STR, DEX (Stacks with Focus)
Wrulon: AGI
Tribunal: PR, DR
Bih Li: SoW, ATK (+10)

If you want Procs, then you want a high Dex.  If Focus does not max Dex, 
then consider keeping Diaku too.

Agility is pretty worthless, helps some, but marginal.

PR/DR situational, if you need the resists, handy to have.

If you have Run 3 or better, then consider dumping Bih Li, the attack 
bonus is small, and you are a bard anyway.

Stamina is nice, it adds more hp, so if your stamina is not maxxed, 
consider keeping this one.
