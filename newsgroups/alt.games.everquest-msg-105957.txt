I never thought it was...you have assumed that.  They are both components of
the attack speed algorithm, however.

Yes, but what he is saying is that the measurements reported are the damage
increase.

Here's an example.  Verant makes an item and tells the item to speed up the
player's attack by 17.236%.  Now, someone captures a log of a fight using
the new haste item and realizes that because of the increased attack speed,
their damage output was increased by about 20%.  They also notice that their
attack speed has increased by around 17%.

The author of the article is saying that people speak of the increased
damage output measurement of 20%.

I disagree with that assertion because most people want to know the attack
speed increase.  I think when people report their measurements, they speak
of the increase in attack speed, not damage output.

That was a suggestion I made (as a conclusion from reading the article)
early in the conversation which I admitted must not be right.
