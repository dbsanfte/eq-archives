I am a lvl 40 bard who was against a lvl 37 necro.  I have a magic res of
138 with no song played.  Necro attacked me and I fought back.  Had some
dots ran and took them off and healed up.  Got almost full and tried again
with him being half life.  Got to half life with 3 dots ran and took them
off.  This went on for about a hour till he gave up and zoned out.  Was
wondering how you guys would pk a necro.  He resisted both chants everytime
and was able to slow him just a few times.  Just looking for new ideas.
Thanks
