Being a DE, I had no problem getting the Hammer. It doesn't proc much at
all. I tested it in the Nek forest, killing a TON of skellies until it
finally went off. It took about 10 minutes before it finally proc'd. It
drops you off in the "unfinished" boat on the OT shore. There are a lot of
Marines around that area, so it would probably not be great for someone who
is KOS at OT.
