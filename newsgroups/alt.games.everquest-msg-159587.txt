First, I think you should probably learn that there are other keys on
the keyboard besides letters and numbers.  Punctuation can be your
friend.

Second, yeah, it wasn't the best event.  I kind of wish they'd just
take the no drop stats off those things - the items are mostly
low-to-mid level stats (well, the ones I saw anyway) and I would have
enjoyed the event MUCH more if I'd been able to loot what I killed for
my other characters.  Didn't get one drop out of it.  Cloak of the
Mind WOULD have been a nice upgrade, but oh lord, what a race there
was to get those few that dropped.  I also think that this is one time
when TLC would be a GOOD idea to implement.  Perhaps with a guide
hanging around to smack anyone found auctioning items off instead of
just saying /ooc (such and such @ loc).  It's an event, not a feeding
frenzy.

Well, except it IS a feeding frenzy. ;p

But as much of the suckage of events comes from players ruining it as
it does from Sony/Verant/whothehellever not learning from past events.
