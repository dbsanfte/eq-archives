OK, the EQLS_window_pieces_02.tga file did not exist on my son's computer,
and none of the other files had the read-only attribute set, so I'm OK
there.

OK, did that but it didn't appear as though anything was happening. What's
supposed to happen after I click the "Complete file check" button? There's
no status bar or anything to indicate that something is going on... does the
process normally take a while?

Thanks for the help so far. I appreciate it... probably even mor than my son
will after we get EQ to finally work!
