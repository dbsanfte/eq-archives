Because most folks read from left to right, top to bottom.  Bottom posting
allows someone to come in to a thread in the middle of a conversation and
get caught up on the pertinent information in the same manner before reading
the most recent posting on the subject.

Imagine, if you will, reading a book in which the convention was that the
more recent chapters appeared first.  The last chapter could be after the
table of contents, followed by the chapter before the last chapter, and so
on.  You would have to read all of Chapter 8, then skip forward to the start
of Chaprter 9 to continue the story.  That is the closest I can come to an
analogy of top posting in a thread.
