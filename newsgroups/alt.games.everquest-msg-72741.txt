*nod*   I'm not turning mine on until I hit 60.  (Then again, I was 58 when it
went in.) There are some very nice bonuses in that thing for warriors.  But I
did a bit of estimating, and realized that for roughly the same amount of
experience it would take me to level, I *might* be able to get something like
5 or 10 percent damage taken reduction.     Thats an extremely nice bonus, but
leveling to 60 with that experience would give me increased damage, triple
attack, the ability to taunt things above my level, more hit points, a big
boost to resistances *and* that same damage reduction.

The alternate experience thing is very nice for the Bards and Paladins who
wish to stay 52 until they get the drops off of both Naggy and Vox.  There are
paladins and bards on our server (you see them on the raid boards a lot if you
read those threads) who have stayed 52 for 6 months plus, even before
Alternate Advancement went in.   So there are people who do it.

Bards use the white scale.     And paladins use the book that drops off Vox.

Has your guild ever done Venril Sathair?   If so, Nortlav the Scalekeeper is a
clone of him, with one important difference.  (Actually may be a few
differences.  He may proc that 1500 lifetap less.)  Rune the main tank so the
proc doesn't go off, and keep aggro on him.   Nobody sits during the fight.

The important difference on Nortlav is this....   he has almost no resistance
to cold spells.   Once he gets down some, have every wizard, every druid, even
all the shamans nuke the shit out of him with cold spells.   He will drop like
a rock.

(I hope I'm describing the right fight, been several months since the last
"High Intesity Hole Raid" we ran.  Although we are going back sometime this
week.)
