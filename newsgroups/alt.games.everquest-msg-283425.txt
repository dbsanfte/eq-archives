Isn't child of wind an air pet?  Sounds like typical air pet behavior.

Can't imagine how you could have reached 66 without having figured out 
that the fire pets after level 50 are (or were) universally despised due 
to their spell casting behaviour, they play like a Ebay'd wizard who 
doesn't read english.

The air pet, on the other hand, is probably the best of the line for 
most purposes; he hits decently, seems to have a high dex to fire his 
procs, and the only thing he does other than that is to stun... never go 
wrong stunning your target.

Earth pet, even the 65 one, still casts that root, which can be a 
nuisance.

Water pet has a backstab he'll use if you can keep him behind the mob, 
but in many casual groups thats a problem.

Fire pet should be big burst DPS, and maybe he is now, but in the past 
he was just a nightmare casting AE's and roots and a host of other 
generally bad idea spells.  Which is a pity, because under 50 fire was 
one of the best pets going.
