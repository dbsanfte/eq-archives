There are lots of Ulthork and Ryhgor pickup groups in EW, esp for a cleric
in that range.  A good group can have non-stop pulls and fast exp and the
overcamping of OT is generally not an issue.

Where would someone in the 30's get decent exp in Upper Guk?  That place
caps out in the 20's and has slow spawn times.
