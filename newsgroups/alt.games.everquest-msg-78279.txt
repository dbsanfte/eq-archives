Capitalizing is good for when you're shouting, or when you want to give a
certain word in a sentence more meaning.

"/shout -WTS 5 BAGS OF STUFF AT HUT NEAR BANK!!!!!!-" Is obnoxious...

"/shout Why don't -YOU- take the Death Touch?" is different. Since the
writer is giving meaning to one word that makes the most sense with the idea
he is trying to express it's a pretty good way to get a point across,
especially since you can't see someone's face, or hear their voice.

It seems like they want to be an effective pair so they can spend a lot of
time as a pair. You can't really hold conversations in groups because
everyone is usually pretty busy. So effectiveness is important, just not the
real need to be uber. (Of course, if uber is what they want...)

Necromancer/Monk would be a good combo, as well... I never thought of that
one. :b
