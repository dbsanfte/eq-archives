This question always comes up and the answer is the same --- "Plat guides
are a ripoff"

So be it. However, I see them for sale and selling every week by the
hundreds. Somebody is buying them. If anyone has any of the guides below and
willing to let me take a look at one id be appreciative. Yea, I really
cannot afford to spend the extra $25 bucks to be taught a  lesson.
