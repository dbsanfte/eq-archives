You really will need a group if your to continue with this class - but as
someone else suggested there are plenty of class/race combinations give some of
them a try you may find one more to your liking.

You can always get a guild, there are plenty out there that cover all lvls -
the guy you make friends and play with today may out level you tomorrow but the

>Flame at will

Not really my thing. I'll leave it to someone else. 
Though i will offer some advice - you sound burnout - take a break - try
something else for a while - then come back - if you still feel the same about
