I have thought of trying to find an eq woman, but 3 things stopped me.
1) I think I agree with Bonker, getting an eq addict wouldn't help me
out much.  2) There aren't a lot of real women in eq, the ratio is bad. 
3) I've already got a girl who loves me anyway, so why go out of my way
to get into a questionable circumstance.

My girlfriend does play other games, but things more like myst, mario
brothers etc.  not my type of games.  

Actually I was horrified when one of my in game friends (a real woman)
told me she divorced her husband and left him for another eq player
(someone I didn't think much of in game), leaving him with the kids. 
And she gave that as her main reason, that her husband didn't play eq.
