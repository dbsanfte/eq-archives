Hehehehehehehe

I have been married to a beautiful lady for over 20 years now.  She
has been a teacher for 15 of those years.  ECE also..

Contrary to what you might think, I DO get it..

I simply feel that children that young shouldn't be exposed to that.  

I am sorry you have a problem with that opinion, but it IS your
problem... Not mine..

You post and attack your own child and then blame others. What kind of pervert
are you?
