  Scream of Hate is self-cast only.  Also, there's also Shroud of Hate at
level 39, which taps 20 ATK points (self-only) for 60 mana.  Now that I've
reached level 39, I'm using this one quite a bit.  I just couldn't see using
Scream of Hate for 85 mana though.

  On the plus side, at least one Shadow Knight spell introduced with Luclin
is nice: Scream of Death.  It's like Vampiric Embrace, only it apparently
taps 25 points of damage which is fixed, unlike Vampiric Embrace which taps
health partially depending on your level.  At level 39, the 25 point
increase is an improvement over the 21 point VE procs, SoH doesn't cast any
more than Vampiric Embrace to cast, and, it could be my imagination, but it
seems to last longer (and procs just as often.)

  In fact all the Luclin spells level 39 and above look pretty good.  The
sub-39 Luclin spells seem to be lesser versions of spells SKs get later, but
carry a greater mana cost... perhaps to help offset the fact that the knight
gets the spells earlier... but the spells are so costly mana-wise, I can't
see any lowbie SK making realistic use out of them.
