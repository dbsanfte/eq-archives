The National Guard and Reserves are an extension of the regular armed
forces. In the event of another civil war, they would be part of the
"union army".

The founding fathers were revolutionaries. They wrote the provision to
ensure that the general citizenry could rise up and revolt against the
government if they should choose to do so. The US didn't even have a
standing army or taxes/funding to create one at the time. 

The opening shots/battles of the American Revolution were fired/fought
with the guns owned by private citizens.

The reason you cannot have a ballistic missle is because it would
threaten the same government that the 2nd amendment allows us to arm
ourselves against. No government will allow the general citizenry to
be armed as well or better than their own troops. If that were to
happen, we might actually get a real democracy :-P.
