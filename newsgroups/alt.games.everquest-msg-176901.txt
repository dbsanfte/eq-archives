i don't know I've only been treated like complete shit by every woman in my
entire life so far, and the fact that there is not a single one of them that
God finds worthy of anything remotely good or decent in the world right now,
even the other prophet who is a woman, having committed an unbelievably
atrocious list of heinous and more importantly, extremely foolish things in
the name of rebellion against God and man.

Well, I've just been informed that you can't say things like that, so I
apologize <shrugs>

Anyway, you will not ALL be judged by me, actually none of you will, I'm not
sure there are any instances in the Bible of women actually being punished
for anything, i'm sure there are but I don't want to know about them right
now, just for this brief moment I want to pretend that women are actually
nice and kind and wise like they are supposed to be and not completely
morally bankrupt and trading away their most productive child-bearing years
for years of servitude in order to prove their goddesshood to their true
master who is not God or man or even common sense.
