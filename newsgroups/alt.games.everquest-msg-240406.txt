I've found that to be the case for nearly every spell I've had an
interest in researching. I was going to research everlasting breath for
my druid, but the rare component was going for 5k while someone was
selling the spell for 3.5k. For that spell especially, it's probably
worthwhile just buying a cheap eb item. The only spell I found worth
researching was torpor, because of it's rarity and because I got a
couple of the rare words on a guild vt level ldon raid.
