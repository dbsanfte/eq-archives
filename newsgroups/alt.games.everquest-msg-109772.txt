  Yeah, this is the idea I like.

  I'd like to see the ability to bind together many groups.  So you could
have 3 groups of 6, but "bind" them all together so they share experience
and can see each other's health.  Only allow it to work in dungeon zones.
You wouldn't be able to bind groups together for Gorenaire raids or other
outdoor bosses and dragons, but oh well.

  The reason I say binding 3 groups of 6 instead of having one group of 18,
is because then group spells and bard songs become overpowered.
