Bah I sound incoherent as hell in that post. Oh well, it was posted at
midnight and after a long Kael raid hehe. Anyhoo, back to the subject. I
have one of those HD :) The loading pauses bother the heck outta me as it
seem to happen at the worst time possible. Once I almost fell off the Kata
Castlelum cliff because of that damn pause. I'm not sure about texture cache
though,  isn't that suppose eliminate the pauses?

If the pauses are caused by HD access then perhaps I should go for a RAID
setup? Hell, maybe even SCSI? I've never play a game that would require RAID
or SCSI for good performance before. This is could be first in gaming folks
hehe.
