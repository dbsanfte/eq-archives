Man, everyone certainly seems hot on this SSB.  Never seen one. Where do
they drop in case I can't find a good deal /auctioning for one? Doable at my
level?

And there's the rub. I have a bit over 2K in the bank currently, but I'm
loathe to spend it, since I have this silly dream of eventually being able
to buy a Lammy.  So wherever possible, I'd like to hunt/quest for stuff.  Of
course, that's not to say I won't break out the old prybar and take it to my
coin purse if such options are just not viable.
