However, given what he says he has for a video card, I would still highly 
recommend upgrading it as well.  Which one to upgrade to depends a lot on 
the budget available.  GeForce4 ti 4x00, GeForce FX, ATI Radeon (whatever 
the latest one is).  Be careful which FX you get though, there is one 
that is most definitely a dog.  I'm sure others will be happy to post 
more info on the various options.  I am very happy with my GeForce4 ti 
4200 with 128MB of DDR, but, I know there are better ones out there.
