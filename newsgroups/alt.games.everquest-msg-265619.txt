I can see it now, I bring home my DVD Monday/Tuesday, open up the box, 
inside a little manual falls out. I open it up:

Cover - Very pretty picture
Page 1 - Welcome to EQ2!
Page 2 - Starting out....see help.txt in patch notes
Page 3 - Classes....see help.txt in patch notes
Page 4 - Combat....see help.txt in patch notes
Page 5 - Magic....see help.txt in patch notes
Page 6 - The World....see help.txt in patch notes
Page 7 - Crafting....see help.txt in patch notes
Page 8 - Problems....see help.txt in patch notes
Page 9 - Long list of all the contributers to EQ2
Back Cover - Another very pretty picture

Close the manual, get back in car, go to Office Depot and buy another 
ream of printer paper.
