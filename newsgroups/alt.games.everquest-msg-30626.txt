    In the case I described it's the Initiate Symbol of Quellious. I've
heard since that the Disciple's Symbol of Quellious also requires drops from
The Warrens. Did you ever get an Odd X Necklace off a shaman mob? Those are
the quest pieces needed. The Initiate symbol needs necklaces off the Lesser
Shamans.

    I honestly don't think they know WHAT players want, or if they do they
don't want to give it to them. Good example is the Velious armour textures.
There's been a steady stream of complaints about how THAT was originally
done, from banana-coloured rogues to humans with "man boobs". And don't even
get me started on all the helm problems.

    I know. The Initiate Symbol of Quellious was put in-game AFTER the
Warrens went live, not concurrently. Um, oops, we messed up! Unless, of
course, they meant for priests of Quellious to not be able to get the first
item in a chain of three quests (all religions will eventually have
Initiate, Disciple, and Regent's Symbols).

    I just recently found two of them. My cleric will soon be auctioning for
Elder Teir'Dal lessons, if she doesn't already have it at excellent. ;-)

    There ARE other things, too. That high level couldn't find out about the
Cold Iron shipments. That high-level could never find poor Azzar's lost hat.
There's a Lore "bag of dice" off the Prince - bet that's for something
interesting, too. But they'll never know. As far as story goes, it'd be nice
if, say, when I killed a kobold when trivial he'd drop a "Smashed Kobold
Molar". Or if I killed the smithy, I'd get a "Broken Ye Auld Ball Peen
Hammer". Something to say what I COULD have gotten, so I can at least
experience the flavour.
