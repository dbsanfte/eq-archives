No, I'm talking about all active subscribers and not just those currently
online.  That there's a lot that are in the 50+ level could simply mean that
those in that category game a lot more often than those in lower levels.
Makes complete sense since they had to do that get to that level in the
first place.  Also note that 1-10 has roughly the same.  Where did those
low-level players go?  They didn't just pop to 50+ overnight.  A possible
explanation why there are so many in 1-10 is that simply many are new people
joining the game.  Why subsequent segments of levels are less is that most
of the newbies either go no further or reduce their involvement once the
novelty of the game has worn off.

Now if you could tell me average weekly playing time of each player and then
show me how this breaks down according to levels, then you'd have something
meaningful to discuss.  And if you did, I believe you'd find what I suggest
above to be the case.  I would expect the diagram would show decreasing
level of involvement in the game (average playing time per week) until you
hit the 50+ level.
