Kithicor at night can be fun.  :)

I used to fear that zone, I would never run through there at night.  Well,
the first time we decided to do the general for a rogue in our guild, we
took a long time getting set up, night came around, and me a Jabober soloed
one of those nasty undead that I used to fear so much.  Since then, I have
been back there a few times.

The Specs in Oasis, alas, are now green.  I did spend some time there with
them though a while back.  Of course, I don't really care if a mob is undead
or not, they all die pretty much the same.
