They aren't that tough.
Out of all the Velious mobs, them dorfs are the weakest I've
encountered.  Their attack delay is reasonable (on par with Norrath
level 45ish mobs--imps basically) and hit for only about 110 to 120
max (again, like imps in SolB).

The only catch of course is the inability to snare, slow, root, mez,
stun, charm (except with dictate) those little runts.

I as a level 60 druid was able to hold a sentry long enough for my
group to "finish" off the other sentry and switch over to the one I
was tanking--yeah, I did have to channel Cholorblast a few times, but
no worries, never dropped below 2 bubbles of health.
