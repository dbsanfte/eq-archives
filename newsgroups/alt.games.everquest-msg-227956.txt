I was reading a thread about monks getting lull.. So, while I dont
feel the wish to shout hey you why should you get lull.. As a bard,
one of the things people like about bards is we generally do good
pulling, soothing the ones we dont want, pulling the one we do, and
mezzing an odd add that felt like coming to the party.

I feel a great sense of everyone ending up with some of everything..
Sure, why not, the point is we should be different. Bards are not here
to be the main tank, or the cleric, the cleric is not a tank, the tank
is not a cleric.

I do however feel warriors were being mighty left behind after all
they were the meat shield, but Im not so convinced for some of the
other changes underway.. Well, its not working much at all at the mo,
so, I suppose until it does, no one really knows.
