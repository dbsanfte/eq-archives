LOL.

I remember when I got to my high 20's Lyrral actually told me something
along the lines of "Congratulations for making it this far."

It is indeed amazing to see how many bards there are at low levels, and how
few there are at high levels. I have about 6 toons that I play at all. My
bard is my main and gets about 85-90% of my time (the rest divide what's
left over). I started many of my alts in order to better understand the
needs of those classes, but what often drive me to play them is simply that
I need a bit of a rest. I play the game to relax, and being a bard can
sometimes be anything but relaxing. lol. There is so much to do and so much
instant adaptation that has to take place.  I can have 8 song memmed, and
you can bet that I have a reason for everyone of them at any moment and am
wishing I had two more slots. One battle may see 5 different songs used
based on the mob we started with, mana use, adds, initial adjustment to
resists, whether it's the beginning or the endgame of the fight, etc., etc..

I find that many bards quit sometime before their 20th song. I didn't see
many bards in my 20's, and I have always suspected that those that are
toughing it out, usually rush through these levels to get to the 30's, and
the rest just plain give up.
