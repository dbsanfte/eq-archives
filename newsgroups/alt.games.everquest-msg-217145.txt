Food is classified by how long it lasts in real-life time:

Food Class	Duration (minutes)

Snack		15
Meal		30
Hearty Meal	60

		Duration (hours)

Banquet	        1.5
Feast		2.0

Which is separate from any Stat bonuses a particular food has, if any.
Right-clicking on food, while it is in a general inventory slot (not a
container), to "eat it" cuts these times in half.

fyi
