Quick description of Phoenix roads.  The whole city is layed out in a
North/South East/West grid.  Fairly straight forward and easy to find
your way around.  Now, Grand Ave is the exception.  It runs from the
heart of the city directly Northwest intersecting perfectly with all
the N/S E/W major road intersections, thusly the 6-way traffic lights.

NOW, you throw in one of the major rail lines that goes right into
Phoenix running parallel with Grand and things can get really, really
shitty at rush hour.

In all fairness, it's not necessarily anybodies fault that Grand
exists the way it does now.  It's a major highway into Phoenix and
it's existed since the town wasn't much more than a wide spot in the
road along Salt river.

Still, it's a pisser.
