Until the servers come back up we can't be positive, but the
patch message itself (as cut above) clearly seperates procs
and clickable items.   A proc is a combat spell (you hit an
orc pawn for 12 pts;  you begin to cast Velium Shards...)
and is different that a clickable spell (you being to cast Reclaim
Energy.)   Or at least that's how I see it...

I've been perfectly able to see "XXX has been blinded" without
seeing "XXX begins to cast Blindness."   Seeing the mob cast
is spam;  seeing the effect isn't.  And I'm not sure how that
affects buff classes...

Probably not if your group or raid was barely able to handle the zone
as it was.   If you were overpowered before, you should still be.
