In EQ1, there's always raiding or camping items or getting
AAXP (Alternate Advancement, skills/abilities like increased
mana regen, natural running speed, etc.)

Lots of people never get to the level cap (and it's now 70 in
EQ, not 50.)

Yes, new content is new locations (with new mobs) and new
equipment.   And, yes, EQ has changed immensely since it
was released -- other continents, a moon, a large number of
Planes, along with additional zones added to the old locations.
