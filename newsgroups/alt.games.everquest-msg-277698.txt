There is no zero interdendence between the tradeskills, unless you choose 
to purchase intermediate combines that you can create on your own now.

I still was doing my provisioning, although I had hit the wall of not 
having tier 4 access to harvest tier 4 items, and it was right around 
that time that I took a break from eq2, only to be coming back just as 
the exchange server was announced, causing me to immediately cancel my 
account.
