Well, we had the exact opposite, the other euro guild on my server died, 
and the players in it spread out over the few uber guilds, a few made a 
new guild, and a few ended up at us, and were still at SSra/NToV level, 
so elemental plane people that most of us already know due to them being 
euros too are generally a nice addition to the guild :)

As for bottomfeeding, i saw FoH the other day in Tactics, backflagging 
members. Inspected a few of the people, and they got same gear quality 
than most of my guild does. WHY on earth join a guild where your rep hit 
rock bottom when entering, lots of the members left after the leader 
gone "too psycho" (actual quote from 2 ex-FoH i talked to), and thats so 
desperate to get new members that theyre taking people that are so far 
down the chain that they need SEVERE backflagging?
Oh, and saw some FoH beat up Vindi the other day too, i sure as hell 
hope its not because some of the new recruits need the BP :)
