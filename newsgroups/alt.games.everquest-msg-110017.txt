You will still want to keep your defense skill maxxed at each level, getting
defense points at high level  can be fatal.

An Ivy Etched Velium Mace (?? the one that drops off of Yakka Razertooth in
GD) is 7/22 with STR and WIS pluses. Should be able to get one for
100-200pp. A Velium Scimitar (5/24) is a nice training 1hs weap too and
should be able to get for 10pp.
