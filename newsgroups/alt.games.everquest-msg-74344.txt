I must say, I never had an airplane (druids/wizards) ask money from me
when I was in group with them. Offers for TL's somewhere etc normally
even come from them when a group breaks up etc, and for free. You
must have picked up a bad luck streak of idiots there.

Below level 40 (sometimes over it), most porters ask for money, though,
as it's the easiest way to make money for them. High level people
mostly ported me for free, as I never call out for a port. I just
walk up the druid ring and find somebody there mostly. I always
ask what I owe them after the port and always wait till they zone in
after me, but mostly they won't ask for anything.

If porters have to break group and find you, then the price is
justified. They risk losing the group, use up their time for you
(and there's more idiots around of the other side as well... people
going 'I found somebody else!' after you walked 10 minutes).
A wizard with TL, who asks 50 pp from you when you walked him up,
however, is considered a (censored) by me.

: No more grouping with them (until necessary)...etc...etc...

Hm, people normally don't group with various other reasons with
wizards :P I think they rock ... at level 55+ :P
