I don't remember whether Vampiric Embrace was level 24 or 29, but you'll
want to switch to that as soon as you get it. Now that I think about it,
perhaps it was 29.

I only used(and still only use)FD in situations where adds are a very real
possiblity, or in areas that I know Shadowstep will not be effective in at
all for escape purposes. I would guess that I use SS for escape purposes 7-8
times out of 10. This is partially because I play on Rallos Zek, however,
where FD will not fool another player attempting to off you. YMMV.

ST is an ok spell for splitting camps and buying time. It sometimes wipes
the mobs hate list, *BUT NOT ALWAYS*. And it works almost exactly like
Mezmerize in that if the mob takes damage at all, the spell breaks. SO, if
your pet is on the mob, or you've put DOT on the mob, ST will not be
effective for more than one round/tick. I find fear-kiting to be far more
effective.

Shock of Poison you will find invaluable. Use your DOTs as you normally
would. SOP will give you an extra bit of DD, it's more mana efficient than
Lifetap, and isn't resisted often. Keep it memmed.
