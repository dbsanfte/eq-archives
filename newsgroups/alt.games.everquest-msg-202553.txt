Tee hee.

Sounds like you made the right decission the first time round.

And the thing that you need to realise (that at least 5 people have told 
you *other* than me) is that WHAT YOU DO EFFECTS ME. (well not you 
personally, but the xthousad like you)

This is a MULTIPLAYER game. That means that we all INTERACT, even if we 
don't want to.

> You don't like KEI, don't get it.  

I *DO* like KEI, but I should *not* be able to get at level 1 or 10 or 30 
or 40.

I have never whined about KEI either here or to SoE.
I fully expect that SoE have/will have more complaints about the *FIX* than 
they ever did about KEI in the first place.

It does.

Wrong. The higher zones are not balanced for lower level groups.
Also there are the 101 other effects of KEI on level 10-40 players.

They don't learn their class properly.
They break up group play
Non solo classes solo
They take huge risks causeing trains etc.

Fundamentlay KEI caused unbalancing throuout the game (but mostly between 
levels 10 and 40)

> more fun.  

No it mean that you are having more fun, and to be honest I don't think 
that that is something I would like to promote at the moment.

It means that I am having less fun.

> You don't like that they're leveling faster than you did. 

I don't like that they are fighting unbalanced fights and not learing the 
game properly. If I wanted to play a hack and slash game I would play 
nethack (lol)

Shame. Perhaps you should cancel your account.

No the problem is that your argument is we all like to see the prize don't 
we, so why bother with that dull quiz before hand, just announce the winner 
and be done with it.
