I can't wait for 60 water :)  I already know that
a top con Vocarate Water will outdamage a 55 ranger
(FBSS, Jagged Sword fo Mourning and LSOEE - not uber
by any means) on every thing from level 41 elemental
warriors to level 53 rock golems.  The difference
gets lower as the mobs level increases, the margin
on the 53 golem was only a couple of DPS.  Now that
he's epiced, I doubt Spike will outdamage him anymore :(

I'm hoping 60 water + muzzle of Mardu will tip the
scales back in my favor :)
