First off the most accurate way to test a haste Itme is to get a Non Melee
class (no double attacks) to beat on another Non Melee Class or from behind
a tank. I personally use a 2hb 40dly weapon and time it for 2 min, then add
a haste Item and time for 2 min. Count the swings of each and calclate the
haste. Then repeate 2 or 3 more times and average. For best results go to a
low populated zone (areana works good) turn off all OOC Shouts Auc and turn
on display my Misses.
