This has been dragged out here before, but I'll remind you (as was
posted in this group) that VI posted on the developer boards, (in their
opinion, and of course, it's only their game ya know) that the "Pure
casters" were the non-melee spell users. The rest were melee and
hybrids. The pure casters are broken down into the wis casters (priests)
and the Int casters. This is also how I've always heard it and used the
terms.
