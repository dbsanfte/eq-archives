>This sounded like a great idea until someone mentioned that PL'ing sucks for
>several reasons:

1. Skills won't raise.

Your combat skills Offense, Defense, Dodge, 1HB etc will go up, and
usually max out while PL'ing if you are being hit by multiple mobs.

Casting skills will NOT advance. To correct this take a break from
PL'ing and chain cast a low mana, fast cast spell of each type. For
example casting True North over and over again to raise your
Divination skill, or Summon Food/Water to raise Conj. It may take you
2-3 hours of casting and medding to max the skills depending on how
many levels you PL though, but you still come out ahead in total time
played.

2. You will NOT learn how to play EQ.

This is a serious problem with PL'ing. Unless you have played at least
1 character to the higher levels (at least 25-30 or many different
characters to at least 15-20)  you will most likely not "really" know
how to play EQ. When you play that one character through all the
levels you will not only learn how to play your class/race, you will
learn about all the other classess as you group with and interact with
them. You will also learn the nuances of the game mechanics, and
develop the skills required to be an effective member of a group.
