Hey guys. I have 3 accounts for EQ now. Two of them I am not the original 
owner of. I'd like to consolidate the two extra accounts into one by moving 
two toons from one account to the other. The problem is, where the billing 
histories on the two accounts do not match SOE won't do it.

Does anybody have any ideas for me to get around this somehow? I've been 
paying for both these accounts for months now and they are legitimately mine 
but I don't know if I am going to be able to move any of these toons and I 
don't want to be paying for two extra accounts when one extra would be 
plenty.
