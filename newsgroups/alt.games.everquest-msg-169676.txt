every class has his strengths and weaknesses....and every class becomes
"sick" with uber equipment. that shudnt be a question at all :p. every melee
class cud and will be able to tank hard mobs with uber gear.
i dont understand bitching bout classes at all.......ur an sk? wel no1 can
hold agro like u! ur a pally? no other melee can tank AND heal like u! ur a
rog? no1 can match ur sneak/hide abilitie and deal out more melee damage! ur
a ranger? u have some nice buffs and no1 can match ur Bow damage plus ur
track rules! ur a war? no1 will match ur HP and there always be some uber
mobs that only can be tanked by u with defensive! ur a bard? some of ur
songs r vital for any raid to be successfull at all and ur movement is
awesome! ur a BST? ur pet is a sick damage dealer and u add nice hp/mana
regen to groups/raids!
all of em tho  become SICK and can TANK if uber equipped.......so whats the
point?
is the solo abilitie? rofl some classes can some dont...suck it up.
