The thing is, even if every item on his character cost 50pp, which he
says is the max he paid, it wouldn't be that hard for a L12 paladin to
raise that 1kpp nowadays, just by farming tradeskill items to sell to
higher levels. So it's pretty borderline twinking for sure, as nothing
he has is really unobtainable, unless everything has been scooped up
from the bazaar now to farm tribute points.
