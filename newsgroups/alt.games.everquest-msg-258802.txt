I think there are some in Skyshine, although too high level for our OP 
anyway.

You can get a Flawless Ivory Horn to drop in Shadeweaver's Thicket off 
mobs that are around level 7 that is a wind instrument usuable in 
primary slot.  You can also probably buy it off a vendor there in the 
zone for a few silver; there's usually one there.

This thing drops off a named in POJ trial of exectution, impossible for 
our OP to get there to loot it.  Course its usually in bazaar quite 
cheap... but he asked for stuff he can get himself.

And very affordable really, not even the sort of thing you'd have to 
farm spiderling silks for.

But, IMO, the best stringed instrument the OP is going to see for a long 
time is the Lute of the Jharin apprentice, part of the Vah Shir bard 
quests; this thing is, incredibly, Primary slot weildable, and you can't 
beat that till you can loot/afford a Lute of the Howler, get your epic, 
or buy some of the incredible armor slot string effect items out there.

If the OP isn't a Vah Shir, I'll have to agree with you that there's 
really no string he can afford thats better than the Combine stuff.  And 
I'll have to offer my condolences.
