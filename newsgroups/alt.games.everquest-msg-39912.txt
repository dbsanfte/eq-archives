*hands Sang a sarcasm detector*
Do I have to go to the point of suggesting I should solo by putting on
a damageshield and letting a mob beat on me while I chain cast heals
on myself?

There are many groups where the only damage I do is through the tank's
damage shields, but there are cases where I am in a small group or
even solo where I have to do hurtful things to mobs myself. I do that
most efficiently by dotting, and if someone can do more damage for
less mana with a nuke than I can with a dot, I appreciate their
company. I was somewhat surprised to find out I currently nuke a mite
better than a level 44 wizard (barring resists)

I'm happy for you. I recall you saying your druid was nothing but a
taxi in the endgame.
