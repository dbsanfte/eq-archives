No, not if someone doesn't WANT to upgrade. No one should be *FORCED* to
upgrade anything if they don't WANT to. I still have clients who refuse to
upgrade *anything* from Micro$oft, and I can't really blame them. I'd run 95
myself if I didn't just find it easier to deal with 98. Running 98 without
the exploder shell (using Aston or Litestep) it actually improves the
performance and stability of 98 considerably.

Verant could have left "well enough" alone and not upgraded to the DX8.1
engine and I think there would be a LOT less problems right now. In doing
so, they have alienated those who choose 95 over 98 for performance,
simplicity and stability on their systems, as well as those people who had
more than adequate systems who have to suddenly shell out extra money in a
bad economy for memory and 3D cards.

I don't play EQ... I build and maintain computers, many soley for playing
EQ. I was considering signing up for it up until this patching crap started
last week. I have now decided I will NOT play EQ, or any other Verant/Sony
game, EVER! I have been raked over the coals all week over this crap ("My
computer don't work"... my fault for selling stupid people computers I
guess). Wednesday, I ran my rear for 18 hours from place to place trying to
fix EQ bugs. As of Thursday, I am no longer fixing people's EQ systems.
These people pay Verant for a service, it's Verant's problem if it isn't
working, not mine. I've had more than a few client's just cancel their EQ
accounts over this.
