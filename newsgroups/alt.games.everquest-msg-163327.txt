    Well, there are places where the drop rate is even better. But if you
aren't in HoH, you certainly won't be in those places. It's almost as though
the designers intended for guilds to do levels 61 and 62 in the first tier
planes, then advance to the second tier and beyond for the later levels and
spells....

    You might want to revise that. I think you'll find a plan on the
spectral drops in the first tier, if you look for it.

    Not "all the way to the top" - level 60 spells, at least for my class
(cleric), weren't on vendors. Similar to how now, level 65 parchments only
drop in third tier+ planes.

    Emperor Chottal was "no special effort"? Kunark dragons, Juggs, deep
Chardok, Veeshan's Peak - these weren't tough to do during Kunark? Those
were the places where spells dropped with some regularity, and this is where
you had to be if you wanted a reasonable shot at them. Other places, like
Skyfire, were crapshoots for that level of spell - sort of like how the
first tier planes are now for 63+ spells. You have to go to the one place in
the plane where they drop, and even then the drop rate isn't so hot.

    That was broken, plain and simple, and it's fixed now. Same with the
pathetic drop rate outside of the PoJ Punisher/Enforcer camp - that's also
been fixed. A rival guild camped that place 24/7, and filled every member's
spell book for 61/62 spells.

    No argument about Verant and early drop rates. ;-)

    The epics are almost as old as the game itself. The time where they
could be considered "top-of-the-line" is over. I'm surprised we haven't yet
seen smithed weapons that surpass epics. Mudflation is the rule in EQ.

    The people who are getting these belts already have better - Bone
Clasped, Dain, superinsanebeltofdoom, what have you. That's why it's so easy
to get them - the people there when they drop don't want them for
themselves. That, and the recommended level on it makes it weaker for
twinking than, say, Bone-Clasped.

    Big "if" there. I can name better belts that guilds that could never go
to HoH could get, even belts with 100% drop rate (Dain) off mobs that can be
spawned by a quest turn-in. Or belts like that Spined Seahorse one, which
shamans can go solo almost with impunity thanks to the bugs in the water
tunnel in SG, if you want to name a droppable belt.

    The best one hander in the game was the Short Sword of the Ykesha in the
original game (or EBW, you can argue the two back and forth). By the very
next expansion, better weapons by a wide margin were available off named
pops by the zone-out areas in two dungeons. Two expansions after that, you
had comparable weapons to the better weapons of Kunark dropping as uncommon
drops off weak outdoors mobs. Outdoors mobs so weak that they can be quadded
with ease. So what's the difference between the two-handed epics and the
Ykesha? Heck, rogues can now pickpocket a two hander with a better ratio
than the epics! You know, those rogues that upgraded their
best-in-the-game-when-they-came-out Serrated Bone Dirks by clearing
Netherbian Lair for a little while?

    I'm unflagged for HoH - I missed our two Aerin'Dar killings. =( But
thank you for playing "Guess My Motivation" - the game of weak Usenet
debates! If you want to attack me for trying to defend a given zone's drop
rates, try attacking me on CoD and the abundant Circled Toe Bones, Maces of
the Fallen Crusader, and Skull Charms. Oh, and Bubonian Bandage Turbans!
