I'm getting this too, although I don't have the expansion yet. I've
tried getting hold of the alternative everquest.exe file but it
doesn't help. One thing however - when it froze the computer I left it
for around 10 minutes, and on returning it recovered and was patching
away happily. Not that I want to leave it 10 minutes each time mind
you!
