I've been to Knowledge.  Judging by the chat spam when I was in the
great library, there are plenty of people that have PoP.  Your problem 
is you are looking on Norrath.  Everyone who has PoP is in Plane of 
Knowledge, I took 4 hours and I still haven't got everything I want 
written down.
I preordered from Station.com store, cost me extra, had it shipped Next 
day Air, but it was worth it.
