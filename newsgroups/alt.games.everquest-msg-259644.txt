I got the same card.  Had nothing but problems the day or so after I 
installed it.  Then, my computer kept shutting off.  Oh boy, I took it 
straight to repair shop.  Turns out the geforce FX 5200 needs ALOT more 
power than our old power supply could give it.  We were without a computer 
for a long while, just about killed us that we couldn't play EQ all that 
time.  Had the computer rebuilt with a better processor and better power 
supply and (after we got the scratch together to pay for it) haven't had 
trouble with it since.
