Not at all useless.  Con something before you hide that isn't "indifferent."
Keep attempting to hide and con them after each attempt.  Once you're
indifferent you're good to go until you move, cast or an undead critter sees
you.  It comes in damned handy when you want to go afk for a few minutes
(but don't take this to mean that you'll be safe...don't blame me if you're
killed :-P ).
