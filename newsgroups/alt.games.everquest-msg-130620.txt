How can I get TLed a little short and dropped in the drink, thats
where I usually get off when go to FV. I run to the beach and look for
a bind in a safe spot close to FV. The snooty pale elves usually whack
me when I get close.

The drop at the Elven outpost is sweet, I can hunt the wood elven
rangers for faction and fun! Now for the IC drop, I will look, this
could collapse the deluxe toolbox market.
