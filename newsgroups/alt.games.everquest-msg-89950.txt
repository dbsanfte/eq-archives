Ok, so this'll sound a bit strange...

I'd like someone to send me a couple screenshots, as I'm working
on a Project. I need screenshots of the following:

The spell icons and hotkeys of a 55+ ranger
The spell icons and hotkeys of a 55+ wizard

Both sets for combat loadout, please.

If you can help me, send me a mail or followup here first, I don't
want to receive 50 megs of screenshots in a couple hours... Or
rather, I don't mind, but I think my ISP would dislike it...

Also, if you can crop the image to just show the icons and hotkeys,
I'd be grateful.

Rune, promises the Project will Please.
