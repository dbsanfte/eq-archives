 Ah' but there in lies the truth, for don't we all ? We always jump to
conclude the negativity in ones being based on what he or she post in text.
I seldom read " He guys, you notice how smart this girl is, how she has it
so together ?"

 Fact is, its easy to reflect and indulge in total negativity towards
anyone, but being that you seldom see any positive compliments from these
players (Including myself), Can you really take any criticism as being
constructive at all in here>?

 I don't take the NG seriously. Fact is, the questions that get answered are
usually ones opinion and seldom based on fact. " Do Humans really Suck ?",
well play one for a while. Then come back and post "Here's why Humans suck".
'Tis a metaphor, but pretty accurately describes most all Newsgroups.
Remember, AOL Chat rooms are just elaborate newsgroups in themselves.

 Nuff said, no offense intended to the nice people in here.

Have a Great Day
