That's a problem you find in many many zones.

Usually in the start zones you'll find loot such as spider and spiderling
silk. Save these up and sell them to other players and you gain more money
than you would from a vendor.

Some furs, skins and silks can be made into low level armour you can use.
There are also a lot of new quests for starting chars to finish to gain
items of armour.
