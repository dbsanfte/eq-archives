Guess that would depend on what you've got now. :)

Relative to an equivalent clocked P4, yeah I'd agree. Relative to the 
fastest P3s at 1.1? Or lesser P4s? Not so clear.

Hmmm... assuming you are running at a specific clockspeed available for 
all 3 yes, for the most part I'd agree... but there are exceptions.

You left out the Itanium2, and the P4 Extreme is faster than the Xeons 
because... well it is a Xeon with ECC disabled so they could clock it 
higher.

Nothing is ever simple. :)

Yes... but its not strictly performance related. Age of the technology, 
supply/demand, "mainstream" vs "dumb as rocks corporations will pay 
whatever we charge" (For example, a company I work with recently bought 
a single Xeon based Terminal Server... for the same money they could 
have bought 6 mid-end P4 based servers and had a much much faster and 
more reliable server cluster overall for their TS users. But the IT 
cheif was sold on the "Xeon is the fastest and best and designed for 
server installations" guess I gotta give credit to the salesrep; he 
earned his comission.)

(Or they could have bought 3 p4 servers now, and replaced them with 3 
much much faster p6 or whatever servers 3 years from now for the same 
money...), and had 3 completely serviceable p4 workstations come available.

I'm more cautious. Gamers are known to spend stupid amounts of money for 
a very very marginal performance boost, or bragging rights along with a 
purely useless theoretical numerical boosts that nothing actually can 
take advantage of... like AGP8 2 years ago... it didn't make a tiny bit 
of difference if you had an agp 8 mobo... and now that agp 8 is standard 
there is no way an extreme gamer is going to be running a 2 year old 
mobo chipset+cpu.

Intel may be looking to milk that demographic. Maybe not as much money 
or as dumb as corporations, but still more money than brains, and can be 
easily suckered into buying anything that's painted red or blue, has 4 
heatsinks, and says Ultra on the box.

AMDs Athlon XP series (from 1500 to 2000) was the shit when it was 
released, especially at the price point. It started really lagging at 
the 2200, 2500, and beyond marks though...

And the new 64bit AMDs are also very solid performers at the price 
point, although the P4E eclipses them in raw performance. The 64bit 
'war' really has yet to be fought...
