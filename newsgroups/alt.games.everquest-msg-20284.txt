Last nite, I was in WC, over by the tall hill by the new DE camp just on the
other side of the zone from EC.
I saw something glinting on the ground. Out of curiosity, I ran over to it.
There were 2 bags of 100+ cp and 50+ sp. Well me being a lowly sub L20
pally, I went to try and pick it up. I picked up the cp and placed it on top
of my image and nothing happened. I then opened up my inventory and tried to
place it in my money slots. The cp just disappeared. I figured, what the
heck. Checked the lag and packet throughput and I was good. I then picked up
the sp and tried to place it directly into my money slots.
BOOM!!!
Kicked all the way out of EQ back to my windows desktop. The machine was
hung big time. Had to power the machine off and then back on. This is VERY
unusual for my machine. It almost NEVER locks up like this, except random
things with MS Office, but that is another story.
I've never had any problems with the lag or going LD. Never had any problems
with running EQ. My vid card is on the list of supported hardware both from
MS and Verant. This was just REALLY weird.
Well I logged back on and popped back into Norrath right where I had been
before getting kicked out.
Didn't have the money, but at this point I didn't care. Kept playing for
another few hours with no other problems what-so-ever.
Is this what happens when you go LD? Did I experience my first LD? Is there
something corrupt in my EQ software and I need to re-install? Did my ISP
hiccup?
Questions, questions, questions...
Well if anyone can shed any light on this, please let me know. Thanks in
advance.
