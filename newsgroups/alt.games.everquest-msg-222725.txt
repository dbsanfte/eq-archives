No points. F8 is a piss poor substitute for targeting. I'd love to see 
someone lull pull a sizeable camp with just F8. More than 5% of the 
people who play EQ will lull pull at some point in their EQ.

Bards, Druids, Clerics, Palis, Necros, and of course Enchanters can all 
lull pull.

True. Full point.

Drag an item to hotkey box? That sounds like mousing around to me ;)
But I'll give you 1/2 a point.

No points here. Relying on someone else to do the mousing for you to 
target isn't a solution, and unless you plan on just admiring the items 
dropped instead of actually taking them /loot is woefully in adequate to 
avoid the mouse.
