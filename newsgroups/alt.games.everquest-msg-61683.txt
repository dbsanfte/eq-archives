What's sad is that my warrior gets experience faster soloing in the LOIO 
than he does in groups.  He's twinked ( weapons and armor gotten from 
trading a GBS ), and that's the only reason he is able to this.  If I find 
a druid, or better yet, a shaman to buff me up for a few plat, I am a 
monster soloing machine.  The only problem is leveling too fast to keep my 
skills up ( and I'm not even doing 2HB ).  Besides the social enjoyment of 
grouping, I need to group to max my skills.

Before I get berated for soloing my warrior, I only do it when I'm not 
going to be on long or when I'm busy doing RL stuff while I play.  
Virtually no downtime, except for bandaging back up to 50%.  I know a 
Warrior isn't going to solo his career, but I can still do it at level 24 ( 
just hit 25, need to go train ) without any problems - but I have to dual-
wield my 2 big slashers to keep the EXP cranking.  This means no training 
in my other weapon skills.

I was in a great group that had 2 other warriors the other day, which let 
me put down my Wurmy and Runebladed Sword of Night ( something like that ) 
and smack the sarnaks around with a blackjack and a mace, or Betle Stinger 
and Viik's Defender.  The only time I would pull out the big dawg is when 
we got more than 2 adds.  We didn't have a chanter, so adds were a little 
more dangerous than usual on the left plat.

The cleric was French and I couldn't get the idea of root-parking through 
to them, so we actually had 6 on us at one time and didn't lose a person 
even without any real crowd-control ( besides 3 warriors using well-placed 
taunts ).  That was a -fun- battle.  Playing my enchanter with 5 adds is 
still more fun, because I'm more certain of the outcome, but it was pretty 
cool seeing it from the other viewpoint - and without a chanter to control 
it all.

Damn, I love this game, and I haven't even played in 3-4 days.
