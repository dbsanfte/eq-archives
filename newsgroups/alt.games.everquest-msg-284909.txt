The male model seems kind of effeminate.  When he runs his elbows bend out 
instead of in, causing him to look like a tooty-fruity.  And when I say gay, 
I dont mean either homosexual or happy.  I mean weak as water.  A prancing 
ninny.  But maybe that'll change as he gets levels or gear.  They also start 
out in diapers.
