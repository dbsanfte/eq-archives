Man... I loved X-Wing versus Tie Fighter.  Me and my little A-Wing could
take on anyone.

Full Throttle is still my favorite adventure game.  It had awesome
atmosphere, including great songs by the Gone Jackals.

The Adventures of Sam and Max is one of the funniest adventure games I've
ever played.

So what did LA do?  They stopped producing flight sims and adventure games
and just gave us endless Doom clones.  Bleah.

The only really good Star Wars game I've played lately was Knights of the
Old Republic, which was mostly done by Bioware.

But there was a time when LucasArts produced nothing but good games.  The
early Monkey Island games are still considered classics.  And man, it was
great to get behind the stick of an B-Wing and take on a Star Destroyer.

/sigh

Sure miss the old days sometimes.  =)
