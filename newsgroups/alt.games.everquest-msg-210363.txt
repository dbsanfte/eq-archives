Its not at all hard to get to B2.

Assuming B1 is busy, that is... if they can't keep the mobs clear then why would
you be headed to B2, though?

So, walk past B1, staying on the left wall. Ahead you have one mob to deal with
on the wall nearby, a bandit or perhaps the named bandit.  Either way, lull and
a little care and you walk right past.  Then you follow the wall a bit, off into
the water when you get to where you can't walk  any further, stay on the wall
and back up on the ledge as soon as you can.  There's one more single mob ahead
of you, assuming B2 is being as lax at pulling as B1 was... at least these guys
can be forgiven, as they lack a cleric.  Lull and walk past and you are at B2.

A warrior might have trouble with this, as they lack not only invis but lull as
well, of course they'd have to be pretty pathetic warriors if they can't handle
two single pull bandits.

Another option, and a popular one, is to get a SOW before going in (have to get
it out in Nexus, can't get SOW in Shadowhaven), and then just follow the same
route, training the (at most) two mobs with you to B2.  If the group there can't
handle two bandits, especially with a cleric showing up, then they shouldn't be
there anyway.
