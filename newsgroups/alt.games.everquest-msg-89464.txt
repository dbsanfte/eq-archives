Rathe is fine if I need say 200pp NOW, but for long term plans, I make
around 100 - 300 an hour just hunting (low end usually when solo, higher
with a group).  I actually make less than that *trying* to hunt HGs because
of all the fucktards running around on top of that hill.

Besides, on Tarew Marr, Rathe is always filled with a bunch of gimp assed
bastards who feel the need to root every giant up on the hill so no one else
can pull one.
