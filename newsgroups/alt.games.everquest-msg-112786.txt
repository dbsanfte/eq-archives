I still have to disagree with you on the TLC... I hated the whole idea
of it when it was introduced in the Warrens, and wasn't going to buy
Luclin originally when it was said that TLC was going to be in all
Luclin zones.  Changing that little item was all it took for me to be
willing to get into Luclin.  I still won't play on FV specifically
because of TLC.  But hey, that's just my opinion, goodness knows there
are enough folks here who loved the idea  :)
