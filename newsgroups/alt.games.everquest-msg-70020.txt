Are you someone who tends to level fast or slow?  If you are a slow
leveler, take a look at Dark Age of Camelot.  Soloing works better
there for most classes.  In particular, if you like warriors, DAoC
warriors solo well, and are invaluable in groups.

If you are a fast leveler, play EQ.  EQ is way ahead on high end
content at the moment, so a fast leveler will run out of stuff on DAoC
if you play it is a PvE game.  The soloing scene in EQ will give you a
tough choice: the classes that tend to be good at soloing throughout
their careers tend to be the less useful classes for groups, meaning
that it can sometimes be hard to find a group.  The classes that are
more desirable in groups but that can still solo have some spots in
their careers where soloing is hard.  If you don't mind going through
patches of 5 or 10 levels where you suck at soloing and pretty much
*have* to group to advance reasonably, you'll be fine.

>How important is character creation, and how should I handle that ?
>(yes, i am a total newb)

Once you pick a class, go to eq.castersrealm.com and read the creation
guide for that class.  Their suggestions for allocating points at
creation are reasonable.

As far as race goes, everything is viable.  Ogres are the best
warriors, for example, but something as ridiculous as a Wood Elf can
make a fine warrior (a Wood Elf was the main tank when LoS killed the
Avatar of War a few weeks ago, for example).  If you have a particular
affinity for some race (role playing reasons, perversion, whatever),
go ahead and do it.

EQ is pretty much *all* about equipment once you get past the low
levels.  Equipment will overcome any goofs made at creation.  Don't do
anything really stupid (e.g., Half-elf druid with all points in
dexterity and intelligence) and you'll be fine (again...just follow
the guide at eq.castersrealm.com, and you will be fine).

>Is there portal magic or do you have to run everywhere ?

Druids and wizards can port themselves starting at 19 for druids and
20 for wizards, and they can port others starting at level 29.  Unless
you play a druid or wizard, don't count on getting a port.

Go to www.eqatlas.com.  You can look at maps of most of the zones
(including dungeons) there.

If dungeons turn you on, definitely give EQ a try, and not DAoC.  DAoC
currently has 5 dungeons per realm, and so generally there will only
be one, or maybe two, appropriate at a given level.  They are also
pretty small dungeons.  (They are graphically very well done,
though...the textures and the lighting in the DAoC dungeons is
fantastic, but they run out too soon.  EQ dungeons are a bit more
blocky, and the lighting doesn't stand out, but they are big, and will
give you more overall dungeon adventuring).
