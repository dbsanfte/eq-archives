Point to my "bitch" and you might have an argument.  I simply stated a fact.
Never said where I wanted to hunt, or where I didn't want to hunt, nor did I
complain about losing these zones... I simply listed the zones the area's
that would green out and be lost.  If I say that it's true that jumping into
a lake would make you wet, does that mean that I'm bitching about not
wanting to get wet?  The two topics are completely seperate.  Don't put
words into my mouth that I did not say.
