That being roughly where my buffed AC is at present, I know very well. :-)

However, personally I've never been interrupted by a missed attack (not
that I can recall anyway). I've been interrupted by a knockback from a
previous hit, but that's an entirely different thing.

My understanding was not 10% more misses, but 10% *less* hits.

However, looking at the description again it says that it increases your
avoidance by 10%, which would match what you say. On the other hand, some
of the AA descriptions are known to be misleading, so the description isn't
something I would trust without somebody testing it.

I was working mainly from the comon wisdom on eqclerics, which was
basically that avoidance is preferable to mitigation *because* it avoids
spell interruption. Looking more closely at the CA description you're
probably right in terms of what happens if you're just standing there
taking a beating. However I still believe the avoidance is an important
factor - even a 10% better chance of a miss seems to me to be a good thing.
When I get aggro while waiting for a CH to land on the tank, *not* getting
hit is much more useful than getting hit but surviving it.
