in exactly the right spot also.. I don't think any of my neighbors
have cable modem since my connection is always that fast (at least
from the isp itself.. the rest of the net clogs up of its own accord
sometimes)

I've been kind of wondering something, except for of course your
spouse or kids what exactly is the social cost? What difference does
it really make if someone gets their social daily outlet online or
with real people? I go through periods (not having a spouse or kids)
where my main social outlet is online however I don't feel alienated
or shut out from other people. To me its pretty much the same either
way. The only difference I see is that online any time of the day or
night I can get on EQ or IRC and talk to at least someone.. meanwhile
in real life people are not availible, can't be depended on etc.
Really the people I meet and form relationships which end up being
semi perm whether in EQ or IRC kind of fill the place of a dog or
companion who is perm, yet due to it being online that companion never
dies or goes away. People disappear from time to time from the various
communities I'm a part of but there are plenty of them and always will
be.
