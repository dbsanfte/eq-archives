Yay!  I have four characters over 50 but I'll probably never get any of
them to 60+ for serious planes-diving.

Hmm, I wonder what classes Frogloks can be?  I've seen warrior, shaman,
um, wizard Froggies I think.  What else?

>Enhanced Looking For Group Tool

I solo exclusively, but this looks interesting.  Some sort of way to
find groups across zone boundaries maybe?

>New Cartography System

I like the sound of this!  Any sort of in-game mapping would be
attractive to me.

>New Magic Item slot: Charms

/shrug

>Armor Dyes

Don't we already have this?

>Dozens of new creatures

Sure hope so.  Unless they add creatures to the global models list,
this shouldn't increase load times much.

>Expanded bank capacity

Hooray!  Maybe I'll have room for something besides trade skill supplies!
And it sure would be nice to have shared accounts so my different
characters can share bank space.

>New zones

Sure hope so.  Hope I don't need to upgrade my hardware again just to
visit them.

>New spells

Illusion: Scaled Wolf please please please?

A new trade skill sure would have been cool.
