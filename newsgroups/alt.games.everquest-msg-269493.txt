I hear what you are saying but...

In the real world the stock market can cost you your fortune or triple 
it, while buying bonds is very safe, but low yeild. In EQ the 
stockmarket is just as risky; it can sitll wipe out your fortune but it 
doesn't have rewards to counter balance the risk. It doesn't have any 
potential to yeild more than bonds.

Players can choose the safe easy road, and get the best yeild in the 
game. So they do. Death is costly, and risking it is pointless because 
the rewards for doing so are not proportionally greater. Are not, in 
fact, even slightly greater.

Victory in the face of possible death is no more rewarded than victory 
in the safest PL camp by a zone in.

Thus the large death penalty is out of place. It encourages people not 
to take risks. There is no reward for taking risks, only the possibility 
of losing xp. Whats the point of that?
