I was talking about last night actually.

I was particularly surprised to find so many dark blues in one of the zones 
I thought was a lower end one for LoY.  Nadox and Hate's Fury have large 
numbers of dark blue to me as well, although I have not spent much time in 
Hate's Fury.  In Torgiran's you have to go into the deeper parts of the 
mines to hit all dark blues.  Could be other areas too, where the Lugalds 
are that may be largely dark blue.
