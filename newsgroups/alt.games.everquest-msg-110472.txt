Each server cluster is around 25 or so machines, but that is running well
over 100 zones.  A single typical home machine would have no trouble at all
running just one or two zones.  So, while you'd have trouble running a
complete EQ world at home, if you just wanted to get together with your old
friends and go do a Naggy raid, for old times sake, that would be no problem
at all.
