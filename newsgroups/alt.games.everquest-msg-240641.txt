From the shadows, the mysterious "Orbiting Space Weasel"
<holy001@!!!pacific.net.sg> (if that IS his real name)
conspiratorially whispered:

>while skipping Luclin and Velious altogether, relying only on LDON and GoD?

Assuming you didn't get better equipped people to drag you through the
GoD trials and then farm a bunch of Kodtaz rares for you, the answer
is a flat out 'no'. You will have very poor aggro control (anger
augments are not going to replace enraging blow) and most the LDoN
weapons (and *all* kunark and earlier weapons) are pretty much crap
(now anyways). Unless you augment every piece of gear you have with
sta and hp your main tank won't have the moxy to stand up to high
spike damage PoP bosses in the midtiers (like Mith Marr), and your
poor raid force melee/ranger dps and with everyone lacking the resists
Luclin gear gives (especially VT) too much of your raid force will get
raped by the AE fights (Aeryn'Dar and especially Rydda'Dar). You
probably wouldn't get by Manaetic Behemoth for that matter.

At the end of the day all the time you spend in LDoN (especially since
your kunark-equipped butt has no chance at consistently winning hards)
trying to get close to equipping yourself for this would have been
better spent in velious and later luclin where the upgrades are much
better.

There are a few guilds who skipped out on Vex Thal and went straight
to elementals with just ssra and NToV gear. Some of them later went
back and did VT anyways, saying that they would have gone to time
faster if they hadn't skipped it in the first place.

Your guild's just going to have to do the work.
