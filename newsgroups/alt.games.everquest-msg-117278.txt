A similar key some people use is

/sit
/e opens his book and starts to read

any number of fun phrases can be used here.... but my advice is -not- to
tie sitting to a phrase.  Why?  Because your standing/sitting status is
visible to everyone who wants to look, and is almost never interesting
to them.  These messages are "funny once" but in the average camp
you are going to see them a hundred times.

Yesterday in the Paw I was next to an Erudite mage who was
soloing the entrance area as I was (niether of us killing fast enough
to be competition for the plentiful mobs.)

Pardon me while I whip this out
(name withheld) whips out his spell book

OK, particularly from an erudite, this was funny.  Once.  He's
doing it several times a fight as he swaps spells around or
sits to med between nukes.  Not only is it a bit off color, but
its -two- lines of spam that rapidly go from funny to hmm, thats
of questionable taste, to ack shut up already!

Your message isn't quite in that category if you are using it to
warn of LOM, not to tell about sitting, but the principle is
the same; make your messages consise and infomative, and
consider the "color" part of the text carefully as to how often
you are going to be saying it per session.  A funny TRAIN
message that you'll hopefully be using only once or twice a
night is different from a rapidly stale joke on your Pull message.

Some things you'll be doing (like sitting down) are so pedestrian
that they should -not- be messaged at all, save perhaps to
use occaisionally for humorous purposes.  On the other hand
some things can be very helpful when hotkeyed and combined
with informative text, I'd -far- rather the pull, assist, LOH
and train messages have the name of their target in them so
I have some idea what is going on.
