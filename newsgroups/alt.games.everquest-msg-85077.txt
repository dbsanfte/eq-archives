I honestly agree.  Unfortunately, it's not Verant who just sends a GM to
come up to you and demand a name change.  Their naming policy allows players
to use it to be self-imposed hall-monitors (donkeys) and they petition names
just to be assholes.  My bard got it's name changed, no bad blood at all
actually, but it was named Mcjagger Rollinstone (ok, I got greedy with the
last name!) and someone bothered me for like an hour, sending me tells
"Hmmmm, interesting name...never had problems with it?" and crap like that.
I knew it was coming since he wouldn't stop the tells, but my point is this
"hall-monitor" policy detracts from the game more than a few silly names.
However, for awhile it was amusing going into a zone and adding...

Mcjagger shouts "I can't get no satisfaction!"

That got quite a few laughs, hehe.

One more thing...
GO NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS!!!

See y'all,
Sean...
