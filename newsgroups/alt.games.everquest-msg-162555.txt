You are right, but I am not talking about pumping it up to 178.  My cha is
lower than a 52 bard acquaintance (the one who has no clue where to find
mana songs) and yet my mez sticks every time.  I can easily handle 4 mobs if
no enchanter is in the group.  Having a higher charisma helps when you have
a constant number of 6 mobs at your group at anyone time and need your mez
and charm to stick and hold.

Now, what I said was't, go out and get your charisma up.  In fact, I said
that 104 in 20's was good but every little bit helps.  As for charisma and
bards, well, to be quite frank about this, I don't really think that Verant
actually knows what effects a bard.  I have heard contrasting statments from
SOE and Verant on numerous things and how they work with bards.  Plus, if
you are hunting inside with a group, a Bard's lull was better than a
cleric's and a druid's doesn't work.  I have used lull effectively in
several situations and I give that credit to my cha boost rings and the
encrusted steins that I switch to.

I do *not* use all of them for fighting.  In fact, I am a strong proponent
of making your character more real and not make a warrior with all str, or a
cleric or druid with all wis.  I like balance and while it isn't ideal, it
makes the game more interesting.  So little Lyrral, doesn't have an
inordinate amount of cha, in fact I think it's close to 117 (been a bit
since I logged her on, was working on my druid and monk), which isn't
extremely high, but with her cha items, which I balance out accordingly
given the situation, I get well into the high 100's.  I have noticed a
distinct difference with mez and charm sticking and holding longer (in
charm's case) with the higher charisma.

That is all.
