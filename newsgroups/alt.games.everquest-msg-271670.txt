Heh.  My monk has several banks of hotkeys (solo, group, pulling,
telling LDON magus to port me, etc.), but many of the keys are the
same on all of them.  E.g., the same key *always* does feign death;
I don't want to be stuck unable to do a quick feign just because I
thought I was doing tradeskills or something.  Well, one of my keys
is my "special attack" (dragon kick or whatever it is lately), and
I mash it frequently in melee.  Whenever I switch to one of my alts,
especially my druid who still actually does some melee, I still have
a tendency to hit that key.  So early on I made sure that it wasn't
something I'd be embarrassed to hit during melee (like, opening my
spellbook).  Currently it's tied to my /track command, so when the
tracking window pops up during melee it acts as a reminder that I'm
not playing my monk. :-)
