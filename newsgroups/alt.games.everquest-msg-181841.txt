As nearly as I can tell, with horse models on, the horse will not be shown
if the corresponding Luclin model is off. So yes, it works pretty much as
you say.

I actually have the reverse - my own race model *on* because, basically,
riding the horse is fun (and I don't have Run3; the speed modifier has
saved my life on at least one occasion.)

That's what I do... click on horse buff, duck, then either recast or
resummon horse, depending on why I wanted to cancel. If there's a better
way I would like to know it :-) But with practice it's not much slower than
just ducking.
