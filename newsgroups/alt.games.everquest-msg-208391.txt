All skills you spent AA's on are gone.  People I know who
were affected did not lose unspent AA's.  HOWEVER - some
people have lost all levels above 50 and all aa's and abilities.

It looks like pre-ordering LDoN can mess up their record or
which expansions are enabled.  Depending on which expansions
suddenly disappear, you can lose more or less stuff.  One
of the mages on the Tower has a guildie who lost access to 
ALL expansions.  From level 65 and lots of aa's to 50 and 
none.  Also, we have to wonder what happened to the items
in the extra bank slots from LoY.
