I recently made a post inquiring to my current system specifications and
whether or not I should be concerned.  I -believe- (yeah still got one hour
to wait to see if Luclin will run correctly, errm, atleast the installation
of it) I may not have to be concerned any longer.

My question is, or I wonder, these systems successfully ran SoL with or
without the new character models enabled..... hmmmm..

I also took note of something else I had previously overlooked or quite
possibly "read into" a bit far.

Note: Although technically below the minimum specs, players with 128 MB of
RAM will still be able to run Luclin
by turning off the new character models.
Recommended Specs:

Windows� 98/2000/ME/XP
Pentium� III or greater
512 MB RAM
32 MB Direct3D compliant video card and hardware T&L (i.e. ATI Radeon or
Nvidia GeForce 2 or greater)
DirectX 8.0 compatible sound card
56.6k (or faster) Internet connection
16X speed CD-ROM
1.5 GB+ hard drive space

=====Copy/Paste Ends=====

Soooo.. the "recommended" specifications is that your video card supports
hardware T&L, however, it does not state this under the "required"
specifications.  Oh course whether or not it will run the new character
models without hardware T&L worth a damn is another issue.

The above btw was taken from:

Though, I'm sure by now we have all seen this already.  Just making further
comment about it in conjunction with my previous post. <shrug>
