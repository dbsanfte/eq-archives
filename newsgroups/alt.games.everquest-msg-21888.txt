No, it is not fair use that allows archival backups of software.  It
is 17 USC 117 that allows archival backups of software.

My use of fair use is as an example (hence the "for example" in my
post), to illustrate the interplay between the rights and restrictions
of copyright law and the things people can agree to in a contract.

Good...you have *almost* snatched the pebble from my hand,
Grasshopper.

"Fair use" *NEVER* allows you to publish anything.  Rather, when fair
use applies, what it does is prevent copyright from prohibiting you
from publishing.

This is a very important distinction.  There is no spoon.
