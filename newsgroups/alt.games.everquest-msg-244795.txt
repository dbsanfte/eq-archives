At the very least, part of the item exist client-side. You absolutely
cannot deny that. The graphic for the item, if nothing else, is
client-side, and that is a part of the item. But, like I said before,
with your argument that the item exists only on the servers, the
validity of the arguments for the legality of selling those items is
even less. You don't own the item, and it is illegal to sell even
access to an item against contractual restrictions for doing so.

I own a rental car just as much as I own a Blade of Carnage I may have
on one of my characters. I can't rent the rental care out to another
person. I'd be arrested. Why would anyone reasonably believe that they
can do essentially the same thing with that Blade of Carnage?
