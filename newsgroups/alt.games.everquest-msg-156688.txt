Lance hit my point right on the head, with the caveat that,
if you can afford several levels of twink gear, I wouldn't
even go with that much +mana gear that low.  +mana is capped
at low levels.  Instead, with a mage, I'd get +hp (or +hp/mana
if you can) and nice ac items.  The longer you can tank next
to your pet, and do it from 1/2hp (the level to which you can
get with bandaids) the better your defense will be when you
finally give up melee.
