Since the guy who mentioned the giant fort was saying a 50 would not
be getting exp, I'd guess Warsilks or FM rather than BW.  Or
you could be correct and the OP could simply not have realized he
was still talking about an exp and loot camp (and what could be
more legit than that?)

On the other hand, would anyone hunting at the BW fort be low
level enough to consider a forest loop like winning the lottery?
