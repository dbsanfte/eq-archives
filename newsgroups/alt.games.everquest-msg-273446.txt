Yep, a lot of the ooc requests are specific, and you can also have
good result /telling someone with a request.  I was in Nek Forest
yesterday, and needed Owlbears for the EL boat quest. I put out a few
/ooc requests, but had no luck.  However, after /telling a few people
of my level, and I soon had 2 companions.  Once I have them, it was
easy to get the last few slots filled.  In my experience, when you're
getting a group together, it's the first person that's the hardest to
get.  Once you do, the rest tend to folllow quickly (especially if the
first person you get is a healer   :).

Unfortuntely, it's hit and miss.  On the same day as the above
example, I tried to get a AQ6 group together, in TS, with no luck.
I'll be trying again soon, but am not hopeful, as most people hunting
in TS are there for giants, and often little else.
