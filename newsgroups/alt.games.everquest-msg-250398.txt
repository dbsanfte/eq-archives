Quite simply put .. they had to do something. The game is bleeding from
the players that are leaving the revenue base is going down and they
don't want that to happen.

Yes their official boards do have a lot of stuff posted about problems
and this content formed part of the material given to the devs at the
gb-fest.  However, SOE have never been known for their discussion
skills before even on their boards.

Two weeks agoi I posted on their Berserker board and this is what I
said:

Title:  "Is anyone home"

Text:   "Simple question ... when are you going to fix berserkers?"

They deleted it.

As I said they delete stuff now from the boards.  The summits do give
them more lists though.  SOE like lists.  As I said they had to be seen
to be doing something.  Pity they mis-managed that as well.
