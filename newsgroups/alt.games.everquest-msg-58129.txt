Gee. Did your guild PL that one to fifty also? For somebody with, let's
see, what is it now....... *five* characters between fifty and sixty,
you really don't seem to have much of a grasp on aggro management,
either from the tank side, or the healer's side. Your argument about
CHeal drawing a lot more aggro than Cel is complete crap. If you had to
be primary healer to small groups of one or two melee types for any
period of time you'd know that.
  Also, yes, we've done the test of CHeal vs. Celestial, and if all the
cleric is doing is healing, Cel is at least as efficient, if not more
so, than CHeal, while still being massively less of an aggro draw. If
you really have a 56 cleric, I have to admit I'm amazed you made it that
far. And no, My cleric only made it to around 30, but I play constantly
with a 50 and get to participate in all the fun strategy discussions.
You know..... "strategy"? That weird stuff you have to use when you're
not being powerleveled?

You're also forgetting (giving you the benefit of the doubt that you
know) that CHeal's mana efficiency is *completely* dependent on the HP's
of the target. If you're talking about a Warlord in top end gear fully
set up with raid buffs, he's got so many fucking hit points that CHeal
is amazingly more mana efficient. When you're talking about a 51 warrior
in primarily crafted with all of two cleric buffs on him, then CHeal is
a waste of mana and Cel is so much more mana efficient it's not funny. 
There is a definite time and a place for CHeal. It's a great spell.
Using it in full or multi-group situations, right on up to raids, it can
be devistatingly effective. Particularly if the tank has massivley high
HP and is about to use a /disc which can get vastly multiplied if you
let him slip down to about ten percent health so he's doing tons of
crips while waiting for the CHeal to land. The scenario under discussion
was two people, much lower level and HP, killing some time by ganking
Slate near the WFP zone line waiting for a Lucan raid to start. Cel is
the way to go for a situation like that. Stop and think before you post.
