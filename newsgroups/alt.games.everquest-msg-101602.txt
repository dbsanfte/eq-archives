I don't know, but I have always interpreted kk as a sort of smappy "ok",
almost like it was acompanied by a salute, like
"k,k,yes-sir-Im-right-on-it" (and not sarcastically).

That could just be me.

I sometimes say things like Laggg.g.g..g....g
Like the "g" is bing dragged out by the lag.
Cause by the time I try to hit enter I'm normally LD :-(
I guess that it could come from that. The extra g for emphasis.

Aside, I occasionally unintentionally spell very as verry when I mean
very very.
If I spot it I correct it, but often I don't.
