20 to 21 is longer than 1 to 10. And 50-51 makes 1 to 10 seem like an 
eyeblink.

Cities new characters start in. Freeport, Kelethin, Cabilis, Shar Vahl, 
Gukta...

Are there "non-newbie" cities?

Many...Thurgadin, Shadowhaven, Katta Castellum, Kael Drakkal...

My sentiments exactly.

Although ...for a start... all SOE had to do was not create completely 
central hubs like the pok...and keep specific resources out of major 
cities to drive traffic to the out of the way ones.

/agree. But back when the game was young there was always people in 
their tweens coming and going who would bind you. And most people were 
bound in 'friendly' cities not all in the pok.

Not well at all ... No Drop is already an anti-mudflation tactic, but 
its oppressive because it invalidates the player economy. And upgrading 
a nodrop basically renders the item completely worthless.

Item decay makes more sense, but if the items are not reparable players 
don't generally want them (think rare drop... 'charged' items in EQ... 
the charges are worthless... if value of the item is its charges its 
much less valuable overall. If the items are reparable then you 
basically have added a cash/time sink to the game... but not an item sink.

Level restrictions are also a good mudflation tactic, but all that 
accomplishes is anti-twinking... old content is still worthless to 
pursue after new content obsoletes it.

The real key, as I see it, to mudflation is to build on previous content 
instead of invalidating it. Imagine if the best armour in the PoP game 
was obtained by killing PoP Gods, and combining items they drop with 
powerful items from Kunark, Velious, and Old World drops... this would 
keep the old world items if not in active 'use' in active demand... and 
out of level one hands. So the guy who played right from '99 and has his 
Fear armor, and his velious armour, and can take his pop armour and 
combine them to get something just a little better... he doesn't *have* 
to go for the old armours... but if he does he gets some more bang for 
his buck.
