Which only demonstrates your absolute lack of knowledge and history
regarding this alleged following.

Shortly after I joined this group, Bizbee killfiled me. Several times,

Any reader who doesn't isn't wearing Blinders-Of-Preconceived-Notions
is aware that Bizbee, DT, I and no doubt the others who you would lump
together often disagree with one another.
