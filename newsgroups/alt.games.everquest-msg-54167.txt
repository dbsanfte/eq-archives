You make no sense here.  The warriors job is indeed to take the beating.
To do this, he needs to acquire and keep aggro.  Assuming he is successful
at his job, how is a higher aggro level going to hurt him?  I don't care if his
weapon has a damage ratio of .2, as long as its fast, he's dual weilding,
and slamming away at that taunt button.  Get aggro, keep aggro.  Haste
helps, so get haste!

Bard/Enchanter/Shaman haste stacks with item haste.  More haste, more
swings per minute, more aggro.

Speaking as a cleric, I can assure you I'd rather see a warrior getting hit
than anyone, all things being equal.

I have been known to advise -rangers- not to get haste items, since they
have a hard time ditching aggro already, and are -not- sponges.  On the
other hand, once they hit 51 and get Jolt, this isn't such a problem, and
it happens to be their job to -do- damage!
