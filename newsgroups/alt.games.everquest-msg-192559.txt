Okay, how do you make a train button for the hotkeys?

Nope, see Q1.
Basically, there are a lot or people who are new to EQ. SOE needs new
people signing up all the time to keep future game development viable.
Not all of these go out and research everything they can and
consequently about how to make action buttons. So (even as a 7 week
newbie) I find myself explaining some stuff to people.

Then even less of them, "learn/train" the shift+4, then 4 (say) that
posts train to zone, or whatever they set up. Try having a conversation
with some people (2 cups of coffer later, some cryptic response filters
back).

A final 2c is a complaint about all those guides that say that "you link
your weapon" to a hot key, when "it doesn't work" as most people quickly
find.

All these guides should say that you link "the slot for your primary
weapon" and "the slot where you always store your primary weapon, so you
can load it and unload it easily. Similary for your seconday weapon slot
and all the secondary weapon options.
