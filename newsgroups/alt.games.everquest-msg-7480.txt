My 5-year old daughter absolutely LOVES her lvl 5 human enchantress.  I
don't let her out of the newbie zones...but she seems to understand most of
the core concepts to the game (i.e. mana, hp, levels, xp, plat, certain
spells for certain things, pets etc.)

She can't play often (mean ol' daddy's always hoggin up EQ all for
himself..;) ), but when she does she greatly enjoys fear-kiting rats as well
as sitting back and nuking while her pet tanks for her.

Funny note: Last night I made my first attempt at jboots (hopefully will be
successful tonight), and she asked me with all the demanding tone that a 5
yr. old girl can muster, "Daddy can you get me some jboots after you get
yours?"  So I guess I'll be camping the AC for some time to come...;)
