Charred Guardian Shield in SolA.

Range item from the third shawl quest.   Even if you never go
farther, that gives a good range slot item and only requires a
tradeskill that's cheap to master (and useful as well.)

Upgrade that to a Velium Ruby Veil (although it's bought.)

> Shoulder:                Tattered Mantle

Adamantite Epaulets (LGuk) until you move past it in the shawl
quests (if you ever do.)

> Finger:                     Silver Jasper Ring
> Finger:                     Silver Jasper Ring

Velium Jasper rings (another pair of bought Items, though.)

> Wrist:                       Ulthork Hide Bracer
> Wrist:                       Bronze Bracers

The cleric quest bracer is good here, but you have to buy the
platinum bars and get them enchanted.   The mobs themselves
are easy at 40, and are in North Karana.

> Arm:                         Fine Plate Vambraces

Ulthork Hide Arms

> Chest:                      Bloodstained Tunic
> Back:                       Kunzar Cloak

Maybe a Cloak of the Ry'Gorr Oracles here.  Not much of an
upgrade, but every little bit helps.   (Eastern Wastes and
Crystal Caverns.)

> Feet:                        Bronze Boots
> Legs:                       Fine Plate Greaves

No stats on either of these besides the AC, so replace them both.
The AC in Guk for legs, the AC in OOT/SRo for Jboots or even
Buynai Hide Boots from lesser icebones in Kunark.

> Waist:                     Crystalline Belt
> Hands:                    Split Paw Hide Gloves

Short term, at least, I'd suggest getting groups together to do Guk
and/or going to both Crystal Caverns and Eastern Wastes.  You'll
get both items you can use and items you can sell to get plat
for the items where it makes sense to use player-made items (face
and rings, at least for the near future.)
