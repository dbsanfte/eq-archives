w00t is the traditional 133tsp34k misspelling of "whoot".
 From the "1913 Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary", per
http://machaut.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/WEBSTER.page.sh?PAGE=1651
Whoot (?), v. i. [See Hoot.] To hoot. [Obs.]

Alternatively, according to newly invented, er, recently discovered
ancient Norrathian lore:

Woot was the leader of a very popular 37 piece jazzband during the
last days of the Empire of the Kedge.  "Wootie and the Sailfins"
performed regularly for the Kedge aristocracy.  One night, while
the band was backing a performance by a 273 member syncronized
swimming troupe composed solely of Shimmering Sailfins, there was
a tragic accident involving the lead drummer and a defective pyro-
technic display.  The resulting chain reaction wiped out over 80%
of the Kedge nobility in seconds.  The Kedge never recovered from
this devastating tragedy, sinking into a downward spiral that has
nearly erased them from the pages of Norrathian history.

A few years later, after viewing a spectacular fireworks display
put on by the famed pioneer tinker Gnowlookhere Gnolongerwithus,
King Gnobodyremembershis Gname was heard to exclaim "Oh my, that
was quite the woot!".  Gnomish courtiers proceed to imitate their
king, visiting dignitaries and traders picked up on this, and soon
"woot" passed into the common tongue as an exclamation of delight.
