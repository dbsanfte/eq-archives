My guild uses Virtue all the time.  If someone wants 9, then they have to go
without symbol.  I think it makes buffing easier on clerics.  Virtue will
last an entire raid, symbol will not.  The extra 123 hp from symbol 9 rarely
makes a difference, and no one is running out of mana clearing trash and
boss fights are of short enough duration that an extra 8mana a tick over the
course a few min fight will not make a difference.  The most important part
is to have everyone on the same page with buffing.  If someone knows that
they are always going to want the buffs that aren't being cast on everyone
else, then they need to make friends with a druid, cleric, shaman that they
can rely on to buff them every raid.
