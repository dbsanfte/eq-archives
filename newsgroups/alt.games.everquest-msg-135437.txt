I have a really old BEFSR41 with firmware 1.30 and i get disconnects when
the amount of UDP packets becomes too high at one time from a single IP.
This is typically when i zone into a crowded zone or, so i have noticed,
into a zone where many different races are present and i have several
(typically over 4) of the Luclin models turned on.
So i was going to upgrade to a newer firmware and downloaded the latest from
Linksys, but have not yet patched it. I guess what i should do instead is go
to their FTP and download something older but not quite as old as what i
have, suggestions from the techboard says v1.40.2.
One of the suggestions i have seen is to portforward ports 1024-7000 but i
can only forward single ports with a maximum of  10 on the 1.30 firmware so
i am hoping upgrading to 1.40.2 wï¿½ll give me that option, i couldn't find in
the version list at what version they added the option to add a range of
ports instead of single ones, does anyobody know this?
Also my wife has been having problems going though the router with her high
security tunneling protocol (AltaVista Tunnel) she uses to work from home,
it has been very laggy, does anyone have any idea if this might be any
better with the 1.40.2 firmware?
