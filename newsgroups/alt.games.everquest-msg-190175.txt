Be careful what you say, you are going to give someone the wrong idea.

If you install your existing CDs on a million computers, you still can
access only your existing account, because the CD keys have absolutely
NOTHING to do with the actual files on the CDs themselves.

There are two separate things you get with any EQ pack: Install files, and a
CD key.

If you don't buy any new CDs and just install your current CDs on any new
computer, you can access your existing account. That account has the CD keys
registered to it and it alone.

If you buy a new POP CD, you can create a new account with its own ID, but
no matter what you do to it, even if you install the Kunark, Vellious and
Luclin * files * on the computer you use the new account on, the new account
is still only KEYED for old-world and PoP.

The big thing that most people, even some hardened EQ veterans, are clueless
about, is that * files * and * keys * have nothing whatsoever to do with
each other, they never have, and they never will.

I have two accounts, both have the old world and all the EQ expansions
registered to the accounts, except only one has Ykesha.

I have never opened My EQ gold CD jewel case except to look at the CDs and
use the CD key to create the new account, as I already had all of the *
files * for old world, kunark, velious, luclin and PoP on both of My gaming
machines, because sometimes I use on and other times I use the other, but I
had access to only the first account on both because I only had one account
set up with this:

Old world/kunark CD key
Velious CD key
Luclin CD key
POP CD key

When I got the EQ Gold set I set up the new account using:

EQ Gold CD key

which gives you access on one account to all the same things that My
original account got from using the 4 separate CD keys as I acquired them.

I used the "online purchase" to add LoY to the first account, so I can get
to LoY and use the bigger bank and the armor dye and the mapping system on
that account, but I can't use it on the second, I have to go out and buy a
Ykesha CD and enter the CD key for the second account to be LoY-enabled, or
do another online LoY activation/purchase, which is the same as getting a CD
key but done online with no CD, thus further showing how keys and files are
completely unrelated.

I hope that clears up some of the misconceptions between files and keys in
EQ.
