Dell, Gateway, and Toshiba all use the GeForce2Go chipsets in certain lines
of their laptops. Those are the 3 I looked at when I was selecting my
current laptop. I went with the Dell Insprion 8100.

No, it doesn't - IF you choose to play in fullscreen mode, it's just like
playing on a monitor in that respect. However, keep in mind that LCD panels
have what is called a "native" resolution. My screen's native resoution is
1600x1200 (yeah, no kidding!). If you run the screen in any other resolution
the screen has to perform scaling operations, which doesn't have a
performance hit, but can tend to introduce a little bit of grainyness or
jaggies. Some people it bothers, others it doesn't. That being said, I don't
recommend trying to run EQ at anything approaching that resolution, even on
a desktop! I run 1024x768, and don't have any problems. I also run it a lot
with a 19" monitor that I've got connected to the docking station too.

Again, it's a personal preference sort of thing. You will see a tendancy to
blur, but most laptop LCD screens are really quite fast. It's not the same
as on a tube, but whether or not it bothers you is really up to you. EQ
isn't as fast-moving as say, Quake 3 however...

Yup. The Inspiron I got has a 64MB GF2Go. Works fine.

You can... but that way will lead to premature balding and insanity.
Personal preference, again. Some people love touchpads, some like the
sticks, some like both, neither... A lot of laptops come with both now, and
they'll accept any USB or PS/2 mouse you choose to use as well. I bought a
nice little optical Logitech laptop mouse to put in my bag.

Buy your laptop with as much memory as you possibly can afford. It's much
more expensive to add it later. A docking station or port replicator is a
nice accessory to have as well.

Shop around too, check if your employer (or school, if you're a student)
offers discounts. For example, my employer offered a modest discount on
Dell, which ended up to add up pretty quick.

Keep in mind that because of the significant differences in the system
busses on laptops and desktop systems, equivalently equipped desktop systems
will *always* outperform a laptop. Which is not to say it's not playable,
just that you could see a cheesier desktop system still tend to run rings
around an uber laptop. You pays a bit of a price to be portable, and not
just at the cash register.


Good luck!
