So it was You!!  Invariably whenever someone makes special plans and
sets aside a day to play EQ, they patch, or it goes down, or the backbone
crashes, etc, etc.

The patch was planed for -Wednesday-, but You had to have a Birthday on
-Thursday-. Then you take the day off and plan to get on early in the day.
You may as well have bombed the Server room.  You did this!  It's all
your fault!  We'll be sending the vans to your house shortly.
