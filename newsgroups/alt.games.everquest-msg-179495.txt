Yes, these are problems, but not insurmountable problems.

Heck... ever wander into the sewers below Qeynos as a newbie cleric of
Rodcet Nife?  I have... and I have the scars to prove it.  =)  Monual also
poked his head into the tunnels running through Freeport and got his head
handed to him by the red rogues down there.

There's danger everywhere for a newbie, no matter where they start.  That's
a good thing, I think... teaches them caution.

Getting stuck in doorways could be a big problem.  I hope SOE has taken a
good luck at the collision issues involved with a large race in Neriak.

True, that.  And when I was a young cleric, I enjoyed doing quests much more
than I enjoyed going out and grinding XP.  I hope they find some new newbie
quests for Trolls in Neriak.  Otherwise rolling a new troll might be a bit
boring.

Again, I don't see this as much of a problem... East and West Commons are
very close by, as are the evil tunnels that lead to SRo and the Oasis.

=)  That would be amusing to see.  Still, I can't imagine that anyone would
want to try to balance an expansion based upon what might happen if a new
server opened.  My god, if they're trying to balance the game to *that* fine
a detail, they'd quickly go mad.

With this, I kinda have to disagree with you, James.  I think it's
interesting and exciting that they're changing old static content.  It's
intriguing to think about how this will change the dynamics of the old
world.

Yes, there will be problems associated with that change - your point about
broken quests is well-taken.  But still, I think the trade-off is worth it.
It's *fun* to see the old things change, and I don't mind that we have to
pay a small price to see that.
