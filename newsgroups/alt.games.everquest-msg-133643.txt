I'm not too sure about that.
Maybe it's class based, but as a ranger, I noticed that every two points my
defense skill went up, my AC went up by 5
Also every "40" AC on an item I equip, my actual AC went up by 64 points.
(And the gear I used to test this had no AGI on it)
Also AGI seems to contribute slightly.  Feet like cat adds 17 AGI and about
5 AC.

So, I would conjecture that your actual AC is around:
Defense/2*5 + 1.6 *(sum of AC of your armour) + AGI/3 + any AC buffs you may
have.

With my ranger at the moment, level 54 (Defense 206 (not reached the soft
cap yet)), AGI 142 and with gear totalling 153, that  should come to:
206/2*5 + 1.6*153 +142/3 = 807 (rounding down).  His actual AC is 815.
That's darn close :)

Perhaps the AGI part of the formula is different for innate AGI and that
added by gear, but I think I am in the ballpark.

And yes I know 812 is sucky AC at level 54 for an alleged tank.  Tell me
about it :)

Next time Tzen is nekkid I will note my AC value based on only Defense skill
and AGI bonus.

54 Ranger, The Seventh Hammer
