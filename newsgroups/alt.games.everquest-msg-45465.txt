Well, wonder if I should ban Verant. In february, my firewall (Norton
Internet Security 2001) got 3 hacking attempt when i was playing EQ, all of
them trying to get in to my comp using the Bla Trojan program, had 71
attacks in a 10 sec period.
All VI did was telling me that the message was "being forwarded to the
appropriate department within Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA).
We value your opinion and appreciate your comments."

Weell, if someone can be banner from EQ for being suspected of hacking,
shouldnt i ban them for their servers being used to try to hack me?
