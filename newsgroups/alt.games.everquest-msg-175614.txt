That's a good point, there are wide variations as we all know even among
mobs of the same level and con. Fortunately, this is something that we can
intuitively judge based on experience across the game universe. I know that,
for me, a pickclaw gobbo that cons blue to me is going to go down a lot
easier than a rockhopper of the same level and con. What I don't know,
however, is which of two identical mobs is going to yield more experience:
the one in dungeon A, or the one in dungeon B. That's one more data point
that would be helpful to put into the whole picture. Given your point, it
may be less of a factor than I originally thought (given the wide variation
in difficulty), but it is another data point.

Gotta love a game that's so complex that it spawns not only these kinds of
discussions, but an effort like the one referenced on ShowEQ.
