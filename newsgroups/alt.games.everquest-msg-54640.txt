Double Ug. That sucked.

"Ok Verant, WTF is the problem?"

Sound under Win2k has always sucked, and it still sucks. It's not as
though Win2k is a new operating system or anything, and every other
single application I have, most notably BGII, has perfect sound. Why,
after all this time, is EQ sound so terrible for some of us under
Win2k?


Athlon 1.4GHz
512M Ram
60GM drive
CD/RW
DVD/ROM
SBLive (value)
Also tried it with the MB on-board audio

Sound volumes are extremely inconsistent, some being terribly loud,
most being inaudible. Turning hardware acceleration completely off for
sound makes everything sound like it's being played over a very badly
tuned radio - lots of static.
