The Plague Rat Tail, aside from being great cash loot at lower level is for
one of the class armors that are run out of Freeport. At this time I can't
seem to find which one. But when I find it I will post it here.

the only way to increase your base stats is by one of the follow methods:

1) ware items that increase the desired stat
2) *  get a spell buff to increase the desired stat
3) *  qwaff a potion (potions will increase one stat at the loss of points
in another)

* = the affects of these methods are only temporary.

And don't jump into hole, Gm's will not rez you and will not compensate you
for lost items due to any accidental fallings into "The Hole"
