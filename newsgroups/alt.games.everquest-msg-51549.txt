Now, that's how I play it - I explore, I enjoy myself, I'm always
broke.

But where do people get off telling other people how to enjoy their free
time? Whats wrong with you people? I know of someone who made their
objective being the first EQ millionaire. Has over 1.2million plat last
time I heard.

Sounds dull to me, but if they enjoy it who cares? Its not hurting your
poverty stricken adventuring, or mine, as you dont care at all about
currency or pricing.

Geesus. If you dont want to read about currency and economy then dont
read the articles but lay off some poor sob who's interested in that
stuff and just wants to talk about it with other people.

Don't make me invoke Godwin, now....
