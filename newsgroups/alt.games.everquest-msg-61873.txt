I recently found a bit of weirdness in the Warrens, looking the water I
managed to target a 'river source'. Unlike an inanimate object like the
boat it did fight back, but after much hacking really didnt seem to have
taken much damage despite several big hits.

Im assuming from that its a basic random item used for some effect or
other, but has anyone seen more than that?
