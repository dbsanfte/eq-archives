Lol, my warrior has soloed off and on to 30 without KEI as well.  My druid
has made it to 23 without it as well.  I have managed to solo off and on to
57 with my shaman, sometimes with, sometimes without KEI.  It certainly does
speed things up, but, I do manage without it.  I do prefer having it,
particularly when I go off to solo, but it is not a requirement.
