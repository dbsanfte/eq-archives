Depends on how casual of a player you are.  There is very little in Velious
to interest a character under level 30.  And there are only three areas that
are aimed at level 30 to 45 hunting.   Velious is very nice though for level
45 to 60, with some good zones to hunt in (And some impressive looking
ones). and a good amount of raid targets for the 60+ crowd.

Luclin and Kunark expansions were aimed at "all players."  Velious was
marketed as a "High level," or "mid to high level" expansion
