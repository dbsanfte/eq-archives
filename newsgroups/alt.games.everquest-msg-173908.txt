Yes.  You can even try out the other trials.

You don't have the forces for Grummus.  Go for the keys instead.

The maze event is for 3 groups.  If you can get the 3 groups together, you
could probably do it.  But all this does is give you access to the Lair of
Terris Thule, which isn't really a good XP zone.  The only thing in it is
Terris Thule and a dozen or so guard mobs on the way to her.  And you don't
have the forces to kill Terris.

But if you want to, go ahead and get flagged.  You never know when it may
come in handy.  Although I don't see a pickup raid doing Terris anytime soon
- she takes strategy. If you zerg her, you'll die.

I'd go for PoS/PoV flags first, then get flagged in PoS to go to Bastion of
Thunder.  You have to kill the PoS minibosses to get the final parts to the
BoT key, but if you can get three groups to do the PoN maze, you can get
three groups together to kill the minis.
