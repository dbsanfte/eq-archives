Hi Daniel,
I think you should pay a visit to either:
http://www.castersrelam.com
or
http://www.graffe.com
for info on the Wizzie or any other casting class in the case of Caster's
Realm.  I would suggest an Erudite or High Elf for your Wiz.  Good luck in
your quest. The two web sites can explain far better than I the benefits and
disadvantages of the Wizard/caster classes.
regards
@ndrew
