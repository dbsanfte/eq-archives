Lottsa Anuzhairz - he lost the last name more than a year ago.

Somewhat more than a year ago, I was playing with my alt warrior at
one of the orc camps in WC. A guy named Twatof came up to us, KSed a
couple orcs, petitioned us on the grounds of PnP. A GM showed up,
asked us to be nice and share - and changed Twatof's name :)

A 50+ player named Flognob was caught the other day, and renamed to
Flobnob. The new name just sounds even lamer in my ears than the
original even though it doesn't carry quite the same connotation.
