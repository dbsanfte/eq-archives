Enjoyed it... for the three weeks it lasted.

The only single player game that really could surprise you again and 
again that I'm aware of was the Blade Runner RPG. That's because it had 
like 6 storylines, and it randomly picked which one you would get 
randomly when you created the character

As much as I hate to admit it, the best thing for that is pickup a PS2 
or similar box and buy those Japanese or Japanese knock off RPG's. Any 
Final Fantasy game will set you back $10-$15 in a pawn shop, and keep 
you going for 50-100 hours+

I did Lightside first, went back to do Darkside.

I didn't finish Darkside. It felt more like 'I'm evil, I'm going to go 
kick puppies!' than 'I'm evil, I'm going to rule the universe and crush 
everyone mercielessly beneath my heel!' (I gave up on the evil side when 
I had to use the force to steal a little piece of junk from some lady on 
Tat in order to get a dark side point. It wouldn't let me just ignore 
the rabble. It wasn't even a valuable piece at that point for me.)

I have not seen a 'rewarding' evil side story arc in a Star Wars game 
since Tie Fighter. (and even there, they framed it more in the 'You are 
a Hero of the Empire, which stands for Peace and Order throughout the 
galaxy'). Though the latest Jedi FPS wasn't bad (Jedi Academy?).

Hmm... look into NeverWinter Nights. Lots of downloadable content 
available for it. If the system doesn't bore you silly (it did me, but 
I've played so much D&D I can't stand it in computer form)
