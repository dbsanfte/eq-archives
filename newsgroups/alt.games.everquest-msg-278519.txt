For total experience, when you're adding people's total leveling exp plus
their AA's earned, it is probably over a billion.  But it's more like ten
million between each AA level.

That's pretty deceptive though, because it's not like a level 70 kill gives
you 35 exp.  One kill of a level 70 exp mob probably gives close to half a
million experience to each member of the group.

"We need a new Mario game, where you rescue the princess in the first ten
minutes, and for the rest of the game you try and push down that sick feeling
in your stomach that she's "damaged goods"... When Peach asks you, in the
quiet of her mushroom castle bedroom "do you still love me?" you pretend to be
asleep. You press the A button rhythmically, to control your breath, keep it
even." - Joey Comeau on increased realism in gaming.
