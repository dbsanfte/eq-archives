It sounded reasonable to me, I had nothing to add to it.  OTOH, it
doesn't apply to me (anymore), as recently I've been hanging out with
the same folks pretty much all the time in game and doing all I can
in RL to have a minimum of 2 hours available for each play session.
If this had come out a year ago when I was still playing Kaev, and
often soloing due to time constraints, I'd probably have had more to
say about it.  Right now I'm reasonably happy with EQ, and so I'm
quite willing to wait and see how LDoN works out without worrying too
much about it in advance.
