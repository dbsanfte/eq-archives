Hey all,

Couple of quick questions I hope someone can help me with.

I've been playing EQ for about 3 years, but never really played a
melee character, having played a druid, a cleric, and a chanter. A
long time ago I created an Iksar monk that I toyed with for a bit but
never really worked on him much. I got him up to about 17 before I
stopped playing him. That was over 2 years ago.

I've decided I wanted to try to work him up for a while, after wanting
to melee again. When I first started my monk, I was strictly hand to
hand, having never worked on my 1hb or 2hb skills. Now at 18, I'm 0 in
2hb and only 15 in 1hb. Am I doomed or is there a way to correct this?

Also, my feign death is only at 50 and seems *impossible* to get the
skill up. I feign whenever possible, trying to practice it. Is this
typically a skill that requires a ton of work at?

Thanks for reading, and I hope someone can help me out.
