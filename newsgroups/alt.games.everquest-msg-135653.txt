This is exactly whats happened with me, I've let things go for a tenth
their "going rate" to get quick turnover, and not from any need for the
money.

In fact, a popular /auction I used a lot in my younger days was

/auction (item) going for lowest bid I recieve in next minute
/auction (name) offered less than any of the rest of you so he gets it for
2cp!

or

/auction (item) going for any bid over what the vendor will pay... and I
have a 50 cha

or

/auction (item) going for any bid at all in the next minute, or I'm giving
it to an orc pawn

or anything else I could think of to clear junk out to someone who might
use it or
even sell it to someone who would.  Hate letting verant win by making me
give good
gear to a vendor (who will jack price up to impossible) but on the other
hand I'm
not about to waste much time for 5pp.... or for 50pp or even, at my level,
for 500pp.

Now, though, I can "waste" a couple minutes a day setting my vendor alt up
before
I go to bed each night.  Woooo, I can sell everything I can cram into
trader packs,
regardless of whether its a 5pp item or a 50kpp item.  Pity the poor
vendors, their
cash cow just had their milk dry up.
