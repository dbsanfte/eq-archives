So you could wear yourself out enough for him to lifetap you into the Next
Plane, probably - you'll have had to /duel to get to fight the pet (and more
than likely use up your day's Harm Touch). Can't see the real point of
duelling at those levels, though, apart from fun, and if you're being
pressed into it, how much fun could it possibly be?

For the sake of argument, what server was it? Non-PvP I take it?

You might want to be less tolerant and more "/ignore dingbat", too.
