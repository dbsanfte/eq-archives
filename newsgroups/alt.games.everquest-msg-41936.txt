Or what? You'll swear at me again?

That would be the post where you advocated firing someone because they
made a typing mistake?

That's the spirit! When you can't present a decent argument, makes
stuff up instead!

Really? Then why didn't you mention that in your original message or
the one that followed it? See, when you make claims of repeated
events, but can't even provide anecdotal evidence of more than one
instance, your credibility starts in the negatives.

>Unlike you I don't post remarks just to type!

No indeed, from all appearances you post remarks just to whine.

>Back off before you meet someone that breaks it off!

Usenet threats are *so* invigorating. I bet you were overcome by your
own adrenaline after writing this little diatribe.

>Last post!!!! F.O.

Right.
