Dear Sony, 

  No, I don't have any intention of buying your 2nd rate EQ based RTS.
I'll wait for Kohan2, thankyouverymuch. 

  No, I have no intention of paying to beta test EQ2 before it's
released. Given your track record, there's gonna be plenty of things
to beta test after you release the game. 

  No, you aren't endearing yourself to this customer by making my
click through your adds every time I log into EQ. 

  So, I would appreciate it very much if you removed that fucking
order screen that I have to click through every time I log into EQ and
shoved it where the sun don't shine. 

... there, I feel better now. .
