Actually it may eventually be possible to run EQ under Linux.

There's a company called Transgaming which is building on Wine to add
DirectX compatibility. At the moment they're still working on DirectX 7 but
will probably be starting on DirectX 8 soon. Once EQ moves to DirectX 8 and
the folks at Transgaming get some time to work with it I expect EQ will run.
I know it's pretty high up on thier list of things to get done.

Also Wine is not an emulator, it's a compatibility layer that remaps the
Windows API to Linux system calls. A game on a well tuned Linux system is
comparable to the same game running on a Windows system. They've still got a
lot of work to do but thier making progress. I've Half-Life, Blue-Shift, and
Opposing Force. Diablo II, and Starcraft run well also.
