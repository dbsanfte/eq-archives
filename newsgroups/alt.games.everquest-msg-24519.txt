I've been doing a lot of reading on fletching forems because I have been
doing the Trueshot Bow quest lately. One of the posts was from someone who
kept track of how much it cost him to get his fletching skill to 200+<800
pp> and had sold a total of 12 bows at ~200 pp each.

If you break it down, it just doesn't pay even when you follow the Verant
party line of making money in trades by selling to other people. The only
character type really good at the quest is a ranger since you are tracking
runaway clockworks for servos, a no drop and fairly rare drop. I haven't
seen anyone talking about making a ranger mule, twinking them with 2000 pp
and enough wis items to get to 200 wis so I assume everyone is in the same
boat: Trying to do something other then make a trade mule. You could do it
with a druid, but then the druid couldn't use the bows they made which IMO
is just another kind of mule.

So you spend dozens of hours a week hunting low level mobs that don't give
loot or exp. At the end, if you are really successful you may make enough
bows to break even. There isn't a lot of satisfaction or pp that can be
derived from this situation.
