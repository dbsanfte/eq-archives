Monday WC was invaded by Werewolves, last night there were 2 dragons in
Eastern Wastes, one of which dropped a Rubicite Breastplate.  After they
were dead, along with countless PC's, everyone in the zone did a random 0
2000 to see who would get the drop.  My mage found out the hard way that
they will claw you for 136 points, but somehow survived the encounter.
