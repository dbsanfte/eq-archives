You hit the nail on the head. Its basically a huge zone while it still
conformed to old world standards for lower end computers so the amount
of things you can fight in the zone are limited. This makes it so the
zone is very sparsely populated. Really it could be many times smaller
with the exact same npcs and such. Its kind of there to make the world
seem larger I guess.
