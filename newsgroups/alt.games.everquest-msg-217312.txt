Heh,

It would not surprise me if he were a guild leader or officer!
There have been interesting replies to my initial post, but 
NONE have addressed the issues in the entirety of its content.

Most rebuts have only taken selective parts and tried to argue 
counter point.  NONE of the replies have been able to disprove or 
even give a desent argument against.

LDON is Great for casual players who have lives outside of EQ

LDON is GREAT for people who are looking for plat, or item drops

LDON is GREAT for character developement.  The exp is FANTASTIC!

LDON cuts down the GREED and the BullSh*T aspects of the playing with
other people

LDON is GREAT and loads of fun and has challenge for all lvls of
players. Have you tried chosing a HARD lvl LDON and gone in with 6 65
players?

I don't care if you have a 20932323232.2 Gig CPU ... no more loot
whores.  No more trains, no more kill stealing ... no more dealing
with pushy guilds or guild members personal and greed hangups.  Some
of you who play the game, would have your asses kicked in real life if
you tried half the crap as you do in game.

Some of you are spoiled, ill-mannered, immature losers who only have
EQ to make yourselves feel like you matter.  Kinda like that dude who
committed suicied because someone screwed him in game ...
LLLLLLOOOOOOOOOSSSSSSSSEEEEEEEER!

I love LDON.  I have half of my armor that drops for my class; the
1445 point stuff.  Has taken me a month of massive LDON raiding, but I
am doing it :)

Interesting,  I have grouped with uberguilded players in LDON and come
to this conclusion:

Guilds are hiding places for people who either don't understand how to
fully play their characters, or they don't pay attention to what is
happening on the screen.  I am shocked that people with VT weapons
displaying, play as if they just bought their accounts from EBAY!  One
thing that LDON exposes is the weaknesses of one player over another.

On Stormhammer I have grouped with people from Celestial Bloodlines,
Vexare, Township Rebelion, Silent Prophecy and others.  Most are good
adroit players, but there is a healthy percentage of players from
those guilds that make my head shake in bewilderment!  I ask myself,
'How did that player get into such a high level guild?'.  'nuff said.
LDON is where I will be until all my characters get their respective
armor and spells.  Hopefully that will take me to EQ2's release, then
I can get on the "ground floor" with a new guild and position my
character's there to be uber and arrogant!  Every dog has their day :)

Ted
