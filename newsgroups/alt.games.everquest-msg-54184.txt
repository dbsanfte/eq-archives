So will asking the person and they will tell you where they got them also. I
am sure. Chances are if you go up and inspect without asking and then ask
that person where they got it they will be a little hesitant. If you ask to
inspect first then ask about that gear I am sure that the person will be
more than happy to tell you all you want to know about it. It is called
courtesy and it goes a long way. =)
