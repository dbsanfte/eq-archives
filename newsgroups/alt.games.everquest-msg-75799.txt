> Necro or Mage?

In PvP, mages are fodder at mid-to-high levels. They have no reliable
escape method, and their pet's spells will be resisted by anyone with
decent resists.

Necros  have nastier spells (There's something off-putting about a line
of skulls et al appearing on your screen as the necro starts laying DOTs
on you) and shadowstep. Which is nice.


Other classes you might consider are the Bard (V. difficult to actually
kill, but their offence is a little light. They can, however, kill other
people's pets at will until Verant fixes a specific bug) and the
Shadowknight (some of the same utility as the necro, more HPs/AC, some
very nifty jousting weapons, and at the higher levels gets a 'free'
horse - if you are willing to put the xp grind in - and, of course, Harm
Touch.

HTH.
