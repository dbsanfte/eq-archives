Not really.  We have several Dark Cloaks (Ranger only, right click
self only 'stacking' haste) in the Guild, only reason we don't have
more is we almost never visit Sky these days.  All our 60 Rangers have
Doomshade's bow, all have the 10 damage arrows in the bank for when we
get Endless Quiver or have Endless Quiver and/or Archery Mastery
already.  Rangers tend only to spend the minimum 12 points in Arch
before heading IMMEDIATELY to the custom Archery options, I bet other
classes spread more points in Arch first while Rangers tend to go back
and "fill in".

Rangers get DOUBLE normal damage on Archery for targets they are not
tanking, Rangers get criticals with Archery over and above any Combat
Fury points they put in.

Agreed.  I forgot to mention that every 50+ Ranger probably has a
custom quiver with adds yet more haste, Fleeting Quiver alone would
make Doomshade's bow around 33/29 for example before other haste is
figured in.

Warrior I spoke to with Ambidexterity was severely disappointed with
the results for the high points cost.

Ok, rough estimate a *NON* critical *NON* Trueshot max hit with Primal
or Doomshade's bow for the above mentioned hypothetical Ranger (with
the Warrior tanking) is 495.  No clue about average hits but with
criticals it has to be somewhere in the 250-300 region on non insane
AC mobs.

No question in my mind who would get most kills.
