Wow, didn't realize you could take down CT with 12 people and they didn't
have to be above level 55. I want in on that one, well, maybe not, lol. Did
fear outer mobs with 12 people and none of us were over 50 but no chance we
were gonna meet up with CT at that level.

That's the problem.
You do NOT need 40 people to clear fear.
You need 2 groups at most.  One can do it, but 2 would make the
process faster.

Infact, Fear with 40 people is worse than Fear with 12 to 18 people.
Why?  Most chance of stupid mistakes and more chance of someone
getting popped by an assling and training the camp while everyone's
dealing with multiples.
