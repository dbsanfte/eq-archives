}general as a follower of a dark god simply because you practice those
}magics. They know that they're only taught by devout followers of the
}dark gods.

Hmm.  What god does the Necro guild trainer in PoK follow?  I have a vague 
memory of an interesting conversation with him in which he said he wasn't 
really involved in all that religion spiel.  But it's a hazy memory.
