Eh, I think that Verant has always tried to keep their customers.  They
haven't given melee the bind spell yet, have they?   Done away with all the
boats?

If you're even thinking DAOC is a factor, don't.  I'm playing it because I'm
simply burned out on EQ after 2.5 years.  DAOC is NOWHERE NEAR as totally
immersive as EQ is.  DAOC is fun...I won't deny it.  But after playing it
for 24-48 hours (at least) I start thinking of little things that Verant has
done that aren't actually so little...they're immense (IMO) that DAOC hasn't
even tried to copy.  Unfortunately I can only think of those things as I'm
driving 45 minutes to & from work every day where I don't have a computer
handy. <g>

It's been reported from an unreliable source that EQ has lost 10k to DAOC.
That's not many at all.   They will UNDOUBTEDLY lose more people who are
BURNED  OUT on EQ.  No doubt at all.  However, I think that a good majority
of people who enjoy EQ but like to try something new will probably check out
DAOC and then go back to EQ.

DAOC doesn't compare at all to EQ.  They've done some things better, but you
don't hear about DAOC addicts.  I doubt if DAOC will ever be used as an
excuse for marriages and relationships breaking up as EQ does...making
adjustments for subscriber numbers, of course.

The only customers that Verant may be trying to keep are the ones who have
played so much and/or so long that they're burned out.  Loosening the rules
on surnames, and tossing a teleporting gnome in IC ain't gonna do it.  And
hell, neither are Norrath-shattering changes.
