I think Brian summed it up best of all.

My rogue  is highly desired on raids, and usually doesn't
have a problem finding a spot in an exp group.

Here's the difference.  I went LD last night in Chardok and
couldn't get back on (you have an active character for
30 minutes? that's scary...least I know I was sneak/hiding).
Today, I have to log on and spend an hour getting back out
of the place, then sneaking through Burning Woods, and
then probably going to LOIO to kill goblins for a while.
Which will probably be 2 hours before actually being able
to do something constructive.

If you have a level 60 druid, not only could you bounce all
over the world looking for a pickup group, you could solo.
Get that? You CAN solo if nothing else is available.  I've
had days where we weren't raiding that the only thing my
rogue can do is get from one place to the next place we're
raiding 2 days from now and then camp out to an alt.  Even
a 60 druid can find plenty blue to make AA exp or just
kill HG's for cash or farm some gear or etc...my rogue
without a group is basically an NPC as far as the world
is concerned.

Druids have it easy from 1-50, and can still solo WELL post
50.  You want all of it AND to be desired as a raiding class?
Maybe you should get the ability to summon a necro pet at
52, also.  And complete heal.  And Tashania.  And slows.
And backstab.

My guild has several post 50 druids, and they never hurt
for a group OR with our raids.  They're not AS important
as our enchanters or clerics for success to the raid, but
backup healing and buffing/damage shields/snare/root
taxi to-and-from are all important jobs, too.  Live with your
"shortcomings" as part of your class.  Hell, I'd give 60 AA
points just for the ability to "Gate."
