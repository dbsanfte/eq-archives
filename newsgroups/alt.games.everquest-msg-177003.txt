If I had that info, I'd gladly hand it over for such purposes. Not only for
the reasons you stated, but because the little shitwhiffer tainted with his
foul miasma the song my husband and I played at our wedding [Last Rose
etc. ] ......

Its so annoying the way I have to sift through all of this inane end of
times bullshit everytime I come to the group. Cant something be done to
exterminate that waste of oxygen? Tell me where he lives and I'll shoot him
cold blooded at point blank range. I've had enough.

  Don't answer in order to tell someone to not answer.

  Also, pretend I'm not answering at all, so that I don't look like a
hypocrite.

        Last Rose Of Summer
        Find this song on Sheet music, CD

        North to south the time in less days of all girl
        To know the shadow begin to grow much grow
        As sunset spy is deep and lonely
        I give you this' last rose of summer
        Talking of my only love
        So that with this wiggle man will tears the earth
        All around seems dark and cold
        These both remind you of the time
        You know was wrong oh my lady
        Don't despair all the nature seem be in rest
        In sleep she's well
        Till what day not so very far from now
        To the opening the first rose but I shall return
        Last rose of summer
        Side Two

        I don't have a clue what this means. It's a beautiful song though.
