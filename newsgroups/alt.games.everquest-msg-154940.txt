When you enter Sol A, instead of climbing off the stairs over the lava
through the window, continue on the path.  About 3/4 of the way, you will
see a scythe looking thing swinging back and forth across the path.  This is
the "trap" that you disarm.   I use quotes, since it's not implemented like
any other trap in the game, as far as I know.   Clicking on the scythe will
make it stop swinging (presumably so you can move past without getting
knocked into the lava (which it doesn't do anyways))... but more importantly
checks / raises Disarm Traps skill.

The skill goes up faster because there is no refresh time.   Keep clicking
on the trap and you keep disarming it, and gaining skill.  If you're just
using the "Disarm traps" button to raise the skill, you have something like
a 3 or 5 second refresh time, before you can try again.
