Do you understand NNTP traffic? What happens if the ISP's (Who provide
the newsserver that the user uses) all refused to carry anything that
originated from alt.net? IN the process, what happens when they lose

They get a newsserver that allows their users to talk to each other,
and no one else. Problem solved.
