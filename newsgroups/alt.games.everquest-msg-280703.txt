I agree, though I felt it's biggest downside was the fact that it seemed 
they were just unable to mask the fact that combat had been over-
simplified so as to allow them complete control over all encounters from 
a balancing standpoint. Add to that the fact that there were really only 
4 classes in the game (spare me the "all priests heal but they do it in 
totally different ways" speech, people - that approach just didn't cut 
it).

Oh yeah, and why does Antonia Bayle have to look like such a slut? Seems 
to me they were shooting for the same demographic WoW hooked so well. 
They just didn't put an honest effort into it.
