Yesterday afternoon my wife and I saw Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut
(thoroughly enjoyed it, btw). The national theatre chain where we saw it
(Regal Cinemas) is featuring something called "The 2wenty", a twenty-minute
kind of in-flight show similar to those found on airplanes these days.
Basically, the business model is to sell a bunch of ad spots, wrap them up
in a semi-topical, semi-entertaining format and stick it front of a captive
audience just before the previews. It's pretty controversial still and there
are national movements afoot to stomp out the practice
(http://www.captiveaudience.org/). Possibly the most annoying commercial in
the history of the universe has a premium spot in the lineup at the last
minute, just prior to the previews: "Wanna Fanta, don't you wanna, wanna
Fanta ..." Just thinking about it gives me a headache.

Anyway, one of the segments played prior to yesterday's movie was an ad for
EverQuest II. It was quite dramatic and in addition to the usual interviews
with the producer, there were a lot of high action clips with an impressive
sampling of some of the new voice-over talent. The most impressive scene
depicted a group consisting of a young male warrior type, a female caster
and some kind of Vah Shir. Incredible battle scenes vs. monsters that sprung
up from a swamp and took shape in real time as the party crossed the swamp.
There were other epic battles, and all-in-all it was pretty impressive
showing, *particularly* if you were left with the impression that this film
clip was how the game was going to actually look while playing it. My wife
said "omg, is this the ingame engine"? and my daughter said "no way, it's
cgi". My answer was "Well, I don't really know. Damn, it sure looks nice,
I've never seen a game engine look *that* good".

So, does anyone know for sure? Are the scenes depicted in this clip
CGI-animated cut scenes or actual game engine clips? If the latter, I'm
stunned and impressed. But I suspect it's the former.
