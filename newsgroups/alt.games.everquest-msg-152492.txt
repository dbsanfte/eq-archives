You are in your early 50s.  I'm talking high 50's/60
characters, thats not "endgame", endgame is Vex Thal,
Sleepers Tomb, zany stuff like that that takes a guild
of level 60s working months to get up to the ability
to go do it.  (note, I don't think ST really qualifies,
and I frankly don't know what does... I'm just
a rank and file 60 in a guild that has a lot of spread
over the 50 to 60 range)

Whats your AC now?  If its under 1200 then you
don't get the effect I'm talking about.  But get it
over 1200, and then get it over 1300 and notice
that you aren't seeing a difference.  Get it over
1400.  Better? No.  1500?  Still nothing?  Wow,
AC sucks!  Paladin gets to 1200 a little later
than a warrior, maybe, but when you get there,
you are done bothering with getting more for
all practical purposes.

Now look at HP.  Warriors have more than
you do (well, unless maybe you count self buffed only,
since they don't get buffs) but as you level up,
you cap out stamina which makes you no worse
than they are (maybe they capped it earlier) and
are reliant on HP gear for upgrades.  As you get
higher and higher on the totem pole, you notice that
warrior equipment caps out on how good its hp
bonus is... and yours keeps going up, till you too
are getting gear with the same HP on it as the
warrior had.

MR gear is situation specific.  You don't have to wear
it all the time.  And if you are going to go on about specific
circumstances, paladins are much better on undead mobs,
just as warriors are much better on magic (not caster, but
"magic" caster) mobs.

You are looking at paladin versus warrior, rather than monk
versus warrior, here

At every level up to 50, monks made better tanks for
my cleric than any other class.  Why?  Cause they
took damage more slowly, and also because with
their lower HP total, my HP buff (fixed amount, after all)
made more difference.  Only post 50 did warriors
take the lead, because up in there they started getting
enough HP to make CHeal interesting.  That was
a year ago, though, by now the contest is closer; warriors
get to interesting HP sooner, but monks have better
AC and HP totals than ever... and continue doing so
by leaps and bounds thru their 50s.  Monks also kill
things much faster than warriors... meaning that they
take less damage from the mob beating on them cause
it doesn't happen for as long.

I did some rather boring work with a monk cleaning
out Acrylia mobs by standing there and chain casting
valor off my arms.  His HP would slowly, slowly dip
downwards as mobs were outpacing my 220 points
every 10 seconds.... then he'd mend and catch back
up, or I'd pop him a celestial healing, which I could
easily regen mana for even standing before next time
I'd need it.  Try this with a warrior and his HP bar also
moves downward slowly because he has a fatter HP
bar... but when he starts to get low, I need a CHeal
to catch up because he's down a LOT of HP.  And
I'm not getting enough mana back standing there to
make up for that.

Now, look at a druid or shaman.  Same situation... only
they don't get a CHeal spell.  This means that they
-always- have to worry about the size of their heal versus
the damage taken.  Less damage taken, heals same size,
it seems to me that for them, too, the monk is a better
tank.
