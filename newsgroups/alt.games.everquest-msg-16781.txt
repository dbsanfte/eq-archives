The best way to raise faction with the steal warriors in Qeynos is to do the
Clothespinner quest which basically involves running a note from Qeynos to
the tunnel in EK (yes there is one there, instead of following the ramp up
to HP follow the canyon floor & U will see the second sister. Now being that
U are DE SK U are going to have to do this run dozens of times. My
suggestion is to Kill Gnolls in Blackburrow till U can at least get into
Qeynos without being attacked, possibly even upto being indifferent there,
then start doing this quest. I am a half elf ranger that grew up in Qeynos &
I had to do the Clothespinner quest 8 times till I got my faction high
enough to do the Hero Bracer quest. Hope this helped U
