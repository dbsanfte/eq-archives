Be master looter.  If that isn't convenient, and it usually isn't, after the
LDON is over say this:  /G master looter, please give me 55 plat before you
split the rest of the money to cover my peridots please.  
You aren't being sneaky, you are advising the entire group of your expenditure.
 Most of my groups ask right up front how much I am owed in dots.
