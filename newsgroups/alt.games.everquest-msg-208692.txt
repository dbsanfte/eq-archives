A while back  I posted asking for suggestions for good, relatively cheap
gear that I can buy or loot easily to PL a friend as a chanter up to level
24.

I got two replies with suggestions (thanks for those!) and the rest of the
thread was devoted to saying "don't do it!" until the thread wandered off
and took a life of its own as they tend to do.

Could we please assume that I know how to PL: thus I will make sure the
necessary skills are kept trained up and that I can also tell them how to
play a chanter better than they would learn on their own hunting with other
newbies?

In other words, any suggestions about GEAR would be most appreciated. :-)

P.S. I have an ulterior motive for PLing the chanter. My cleric is in the
final stages of  becoming a GM Sculptor and needs absurdly large amounts of
enchanted clay and lacquered gems.
