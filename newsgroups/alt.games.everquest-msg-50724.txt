Not bad, look out for the Gang Beetle mask in Seb Jail if you're there,
or ultimately, if you have time to kill, camp Stormfeather for the
hardest part of the Eyepatch of Plunder while asking the Lodizal campers
if they'd mind if you looted the turtle piece. Cmapers usually let them
rot

Fine plate collar, or your should be able to do the 'Collar of the

Fine if you can't carry your armour, but if you aren't always

Velium FIre ring if you can affor to drop the plat for a very slight

Velium Fire ring if you can afford the plat for a slightly larger
upgrade

Save the regen for times you're don't have an outside healer. Treeweave
and up is a much better option. 19ac is rather low for a L50 BP

Haste = Belt until CoF, SebZerker cloak, or L60 items - very expensive. 
FBSS will do you fine

Prolly your nicest item. If you can find some cheap dragonhide legs from
WW, you could probably upgrade while selling the legs as they seem prety

Pretty nice hp until you can afford an Idol of the Thorned

If you can possibly afford it, get a Lamentation. Wurmslayer, to be

PRIMARY PURCHASE:  New Mainhand weapon

Then start swapping out the boots and crafted as cashflow allows. Try
and go on planes raids if at all possible for Indicolite armour
upgrades. If may take several visits per piece, but it's free hehe
