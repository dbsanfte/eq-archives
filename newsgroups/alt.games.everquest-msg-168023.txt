With 5 level 65s from a guild on the next higher tier (by this I mean better
equipped than anyone in my guild or most random passersby), who'd already done
the trial before?  And with me as a 63 cleric being the weakest link... a class
that can traditionally skate by at much lower level than the rest of the group?
No, not impossible, just hard.  Got thru all four waves both times, wiped first
time on the boss.

I still think its doable with a moderately well equipped group ranging 60 to 62
thats well put together and gets a bit of luck; I came close several times
before with groups like that.  Just didn't have the luck hold out all the way
thru... and that was with the executioner taking slow.   The executioner I faced
when I did finally succede was not having any truck with slows whatsoever, his
"slow mitigation" was at least 90%!

I often think that the problem all my groups had was that they had a cleric
healer.  With a shaman healer they could have had 5 damage producers instead of
four.  Heck, shaman pet, 5 and a half.
