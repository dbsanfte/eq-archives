Yes it is possible to create your own private servers, however this involves
some computer skill and SQL database knowledge and ofcourse most importantly
EQ emulation software. This software is out there on the net, and its
rumoured that SOE themselves visit the site and forums to check how far the
emulation has become.

I managed to create my own server that i could connect to over the internet
and make my own characters and edit them, spawn mobs and do alot of GM fancy
tricks. Zoning even worked, but all my mobs where static and didn't roam
around. But its getting better... alot better all the time. This isn't
illegal either, since nothing is modified the emulation software just reads
the files in the EQ folder... nothing more.

It's abit boring running round in Norrath alone tho.. but you can setup
accounts for friends and so on.. but you'll need huge computer power to
innhabit hundreds of players.
