For the terminally inept like myself it is a welcome relief, with the
trickle down of droppable items in the bazaar I have a lot of fun soloing in
the old world, of course made possible with gear that is more powerful than
was designed for to be used in the old world. It does sort of bring the game
down to my level somewhat, but then everyone else has moved on even further
ahead. It is as though regular peeps and myself don't even play the same
game anymore so I think theres plenty of room for everyone. Most of the
zones I frequent I am the only person there at all... (original old world
zones on stormhammer).
