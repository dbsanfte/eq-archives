   Lenny still takes pleasure in whomping on Dorn.  It's not what one
could call a fair fight these days.

   And I was going by current prices on Lanys (the last server that I've
check for this on recently).  Back when we got that skin, the price was
well above 300 plat on FV, closer to 500 if memory serves.  Of course, I
know that it's dangerous to count on the accuracy of cross server price
checks, but speaking in generalities, it seems the price has taken a big
tumble.
