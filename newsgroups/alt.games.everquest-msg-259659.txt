About 10% of mobs in Kod'taz, Yxtta randomly summon.  Holy shit, what a
majority!

Kiting is the only way people can solo GoD (kod'taz+). Be it agro kiting,
root dotting or whatever, they are the only people who can kill even 1 mob
solo.

A bard can tank about as good as a cleric, has very limited options for
gaining agro (much less holding agro). Yeah, mighty backup tank!

With EP pants (clicky concussion, no 2.2 delay, no impact on other spells)
wizards retain a massive edge on "unnoticed" dps.
They still top our parsing charts, they don't get summoned and killed when
using their ancient nukes.  Saying everything summons now is a lie.
