Most online games design them that way.  That is why you see them that way.
Using EQ as an example, there's virtually nothing you can do with a
tradeskill besides make a relatively small amount of money.  You can't
advance your character, you can't get much that's useful to you because
virtually everything for sale is designed for combat.  You can only
participate in a tiny slice of the game because most of the content is
geared towards mid- to high-level players, and a person who does nothing but
tradeskills can't level.  You can't really make that much money because
although GM tradeskillers can make some nice items, all the *really* nice
items are looted from NPCs.  You're pretty much relegated to a life of
sitting in the bazaar, buying components, doing combine after combine,
failing many of them because your skill's not high enough, and sitting on
your ass in the bazaar trying to sell shit.  You would barely even ever talk
to anyone.  Yet there is still an amazingly large number of players who
tradeskill and level their characters mostly so that they can get the stuff
to do more tradeskilling.  Granted, this is only a small percentage of the
population but if SWG can make a large portion of the game content with
tradeskillers in mind, think about how much more of those guys there would
be.  I think that people who want to play combat-oriented professions will
still be a majority, but... well, look at the results of a survey done on
the SWG forums asking what each person's preferred profession is:

*Bounty Hunter-32 votes (15.4%)
*Marksman-17 votes (8.2%)
*Commando-16 votes (7.7%)
*Smuggler-14 votes (6.7%)
*Droid Engineer-14 votes (6.7%)
*Teras Kasi Artist-13 votes (6.3%)
*Creature Handler-11 votes (5.3%)
*Merchant-10 votes (4.8%)
*Combat Medic-9 votes (4.3%)
*Architect-8 votes (3.8%)
*Scout-8 votes (3.8%)
*Ranger-8 votes (3.8%)
*Politician-6 votes (2.9%)
*Armorer-6 votes (2.9%)
*Melee Weaponsmith-6 votes (2.9%)
*Squad Leader-5 votes (2.4%)
*Entertainer-5 votes (2.4%)
*Miner-5 votes (2.4%)
*Doctor-4 votes (1.9%)
*Gunsmith-4 votes (1.9%)
*Chef-3 votes (1.4%)
*Combat Engineer-3 votes (1.4%)
*Farmer-1 vote (.5%)
*Image Designer-0 votes (0.0%)

Now granted, these numbers are not all that extensive, and yes, the combat
professions are in the majority, but as you can see there is a significant
number of people who would make trade professions their profession *of
choice*.  That is, the profession they will immediately choose when they
create their first character.  That doesn't seem to bear out the theory that
"everyone's gonna want to hack-and-slash".
