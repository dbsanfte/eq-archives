Noooo!!!! Keep the programmers honest! Keep them within the dialup
limitation to push them to optimize their code. This means
(theoretically) less lag for the rest of us on non dial-up. Its like
in the old days of the C64 (or any other 8 bit system). Programmers
had to be inventive and push the limits of the technology at hand
unlike now where they just tell you to upgrade every 3 months.

Theres alot of other software you can run in the background for the
voice communication part. Many guildees (and alliance members) use
Teamspeak for real-time voice communications. I use it sometimes, but
I dont always want to hear certain folk flirting with others ;)
