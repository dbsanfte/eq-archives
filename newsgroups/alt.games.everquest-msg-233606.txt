   I've played so many different race/class combos I can't begin to remember
them all, let alone list them.  But now that I've settled down on a main, I do
wish I had picked a different race than the ever popular choice of High Elf for
my cleric.

   If I could change her right now into something else, I would probably pick
something unusual, like Gnome or Erudite, or even human.  There are just too
many damned High Elf clerics!
