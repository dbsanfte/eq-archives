I'm guessing what's causing it is the recent netcode change by Verant that
supposedly didn't send position updates anymore when someone was standing
still. It's probably just a side-effect of this change to save bandwidth on
this so they could send more updates when people were actually moving. I
could be wrong though. ;)
