His loot is ok.. he's not risk v reward (requiring the same offtanking and
mezzing as emp)

 If it was an 'idol' style encounter I'd agree, but they have every reason
for shooting at Blood. I would, however, take the

Thats a fair compromise I guess... but in the same way deliberatly killing
TM's to stop a guild killing Cursed is abuse.. how is killing blood to stop
a guild killing Emp not also abuse?

Shrug maybe.. but I really, really doubt it

So does everybody have the same right to kill Idol too, whether they have a
hope in hell versus the AoW or not?
Remember, AoW was changed to stop guilds with zero chance of success
spawning/triggering him.

Im in a US guild but raids start very early, so we generally have np killing
a mob before rival guilds can race us for it... that doesn't mean we don't
get griefed though, fuckers who kill single TM's while they wait for more of
their guild to get online, or who sit infront of a mob/pull path with too
small numbers, whilst a guild is ready to engage, can blow me :/

HoH trials is a popular one for people to grief...  Im willing to accept the
first few blown triggers were accidental.. but when a certain trial is just
NEVER available...

How does Seru differ from Emp?  If your killing Emp, then presumably your
getting a decent raid force online before patches.. so why not divert that
attention to Seru sometime?

His loot is really nice :)  He's also the most badass mob I've ever seen
