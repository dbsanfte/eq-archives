Luclin can be good if you don't like crowds. In grimling forest, for the
last few days, there have been people running through the zone but the only
characters actually fighting were my own.

I pretty much gave up on grouping because of nasty experiences, and hate
that whole hassle of trying to find something which isn't camped. For
example, highkeep is notorious for having groups that are in the warrior
room but would really like to pull from raiders as well.

Unfortunately, they often aren't tough enough, and so a wave of raiders
regularly swept through the other groups and up to the guards. When i
offered to stop the trains caused by one group by killing off the overflow,
they weren't interested, so i packed my bags and levelled elsewhere. It was
pretty sweet when luclin first came out tho; high keep was abandoned, and i
soloed the raiders (blue to me) for three nights.
