Well, you could blindly stumble around for a couple hours, triggering
the Death Squad all the while.. but there are a few tricks to finding
him.

One is to sit near the Kael ramp and summon up a pet.  Interesting
thing about pets, they face the nearest NPC in range.  Since Tanik's
spawn is counted as a trap, and traps are counted as NPCs, the pet
will usually point to the direction of the nearest Tranik/Death Squad
trap.  I did this quest with a druid friend, who charmed a rabbit for
a pet, and told him to /pet guard here.  Sure enough, after a few
moments, the bunny oriented himself to directly face the dwarf spawn.
Then it was a simple matter of running over that direction until I
stumbled upon him.

If you find yourself without pet, you can try to "hand" the spawn an
item. Pick a spot close to where you know Tranik has a chance of
spawning, a hill makes a good choice as you can see more of the
surrounding area.  From here, you simply click over every visible spot
of terrain.  Every so often you'll get the message "so and so is too
far away to trade"... using this, you can, after a while, tell where
the spawns are, as you will be attempting to hand them an item.

Yeah, this works fine.  He doesn't give you any items the first time
you spawn him, he just tells you info for the quest.  You can hand him
the vial, get the letter in return  and then run like hell,as there is
probably a Death Squad on your ass.
