That's not really the issue.  The server will always have to send
information to the client - there wouldn't be a game otherwise.  The
real concern is storing game data (e.g. your hitpoints, equipment) on
the client side and having the server believe what the client tells
it.  Diablo was a prime example of how not to code a multiplayer game -
it was trivially easy to hack the client databases to create an uber
character.

Indeed.  The datastream will *always* be reverse engineered, and smart
games companies know this, I'm sure.  While the client code is in the
hands of the user, it can be disassembled.

One of the biggest challenges of online gaming in the future is how to
ensure that knowing what the client & server are saying to each other
gives you as little advantage as possible in the game.  EQ does a
moderately OK job at this, but there are still major problems - ShowEQ
makes it easy for someone to see what mobs are up, for example, and can
even notify you when a new mob spawns.
