One account gives you 8 character slots on each and every server that is
normal. PLus the requisite number on the restricted servers (eg 1 on
Firiona Vie if I remember correctly)

The charge covers all those no matter how many or few you use. One account
means you can onlybe using one character on any of the servers at any one
time.
