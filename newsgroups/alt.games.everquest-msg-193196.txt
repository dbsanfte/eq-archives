   /bug worked on Test the last time I tried, which was this
weekend when I was trapped.  I guess you try making a /bug mule
there to report the problem.  If that doesn't work, you might go
to EQ Live and select the "Contact your GM" option.  I dunno if a
bug report would get passed on to the devs, but worth a try.
