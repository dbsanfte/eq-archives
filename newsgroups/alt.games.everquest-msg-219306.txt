I have not been on a 51 pt mission as yet (level too low), but to
make this comparison fair you need to note that the number of mobs
you have to kill to get the named to spawn is at most 50% of the
number you would have to kill in a "slaughter", and that it is
pretty trivial to find the named if you have a map (maps for most
or all LDoN zones are readily available), and finally that it's not
as if you're trying to kill a tier 3 PoP boss here.

> kill xx AND find <npc> AND clear path to zone out while keeping <npc> alive

Rescues are (usually) easier than assassinations, if you can't clear
a path to the hostage how in hell are you gonna "kill xx"?  Hostage
is just as easy to find as a Boss.  Your "AND clear a path to the
zone out while keeping <npc> alive" is a pretty lame objection when
you consider that you clear that path on your way _to_ the NPC.

> kill xx where xx = 5 * amount of collects

Here I'll agree, these are basicly just an opportunity to get screwed
by the RNG.

In my experience this is just not true.  In fact, the group I had
last night that won an assassinate might not have been able to win
slaughter, we were a bit light in DPS and bypassed quite a few mobs
on our way to the boss.

One word:  maps.

Without a map assassinate and rescue can be tough.  Collections are
not hurt as much by the lack of a map as you can compensate quite a
bit with your exploration "style".  Collections suffer from exposure
to the RNG much more than any other obstacle.
