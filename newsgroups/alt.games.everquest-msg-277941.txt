Not really. But optimism that game integrity will prevail in the face of 
SOE greed is like searching for fresh fruit in the sewer.

Doesn't matter if they dont go through with it. That they've even 
started down the road demonstrates they have no vision nor interest in 
preserving the integrity of the game if they can make a buck.

At this time SOE no longer beleives that such activities are wrong, or 
cheating. The EULA's no longer reflect what SOE beleives. This will be 
corrected soon enough... after all they have to figure out how to word 
it so that its only cheating and morally wrong if you sell your plat 
without using the station exchange service... ;)

Its hair splitting.

Once upon a time, SOE/(and Verant before it) claimed that that selling 
items and characters was against their vision of how the game was to be 
played, against the rules of the game, and a violation of the end user 
license agreement to which you were bound in order to continue playing 
the game. 

Sure they never really emphatically enforced it, but the party line was 
always "selling stuff is bad, mmmmkay!" That's no longer true. The fact 
that it hasn't propogated to all titles, or all servers, or even gone 
live at all is completely irrelevant. SOE can no longer claim they have 
any philosophical objection to the practice.
