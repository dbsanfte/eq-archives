<sigh>  I get slammed in one thread for defending Druids, and in this one
for trashing them.

Look, each class has its jerks, and each technique has it's potential
problems that can be a pain for others.  These are just those things that
could and do go wrong with quadding and in doing so can appear inconsiderate
or rude.  Warning a fellow Druid about the potential pitfalls of a
technique, and how to avoid ticking off his fellow players while using it
does NOT imply ANYTHING about "all Druids" or "No Druids" or any other such
rediculous thing.
