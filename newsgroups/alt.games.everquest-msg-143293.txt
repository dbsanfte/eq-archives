Hmm...yeah, I think it was. It was their fault they lost out, not
Annie's. They were just as greedy. It is clear they were willing to
add more to the deal, else they wouldn't have been so upset at not
getting the chance to do so. Why? Because they were greedy - not
willing to pay up front what it would take to insure a clean
transaction.

Beware when desperation and greed collide...
