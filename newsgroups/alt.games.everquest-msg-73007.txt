You get 50% exp only if your pet outdamages your party.  While
soloing, this can indeed be a problem, the pet is so effective at some
levels that it will outdamage an untwinked BL quite handily,
particularly
if the BL is smart enough to back out of the fight and work as a healer
during part of the battle.

Here's the secret: Verant doesn't really want you to solo.  Get even
one partner and you will certainly be able to outdamage the pet;
your (slightly weak) monk damage output plus that of any other
group mate are going to be higher than that of the warder.

For real fun, group with another BL: now its you, other BL, and
other BL's warder versus your BL, and at the same time its
Your warder, you, other BL versus his warder.  Pretty clearly
if you and the other BL fight even part of each battle you are
going to beat out your warders.

3 BL are even worse, now the BL don't even need to fight, as
each pet is going to be outdamaged by the other two, the
BL themselves can do nothing but med and cast heals while
the remarkably damage absorbant pets do all the grunt work.
This won't get you any skill ups though, so keep it for special
occaisions.

I was in a 6 beastlord group in the Loda Kai cave, and it
was simply awesome; 10 melee, 1 healer, and one person
medding, non stop action.  When the healer went OOM,
he would sit, person medding would go to melee, and the
next BL would become healer.  We could easily take down
full pop of the room despite some of it being red con to us

Mixed groups work well too, a rogue can ditch aggro to
your pet with Evade for his backstab, a warrior need never
let go of aggro at all, a bard boosts your and his performance
(sadly not the pets) and a shaman can take over your healing
duties and also slow the prey so you don't get hit so much.
I'm afraid I don't have much experience with non Vah Shir
classes, although the potential is clear, Beastlord looks
like a class that works and plays well with others... except for
chanters.  As with the other pet classes, we are crippled when
it comes to situations where a renegade pet breaking mez means
death for first the chanter then the rest of the party.  One possiblity
would be to kill the pet and make a new one once the combat is
under control each time
