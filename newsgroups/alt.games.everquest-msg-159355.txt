That's not what I was on about (already knew he was a Monk).  My point
was/is that "and probably a melee class", in context, voices a belief
in entitlement to privilege.  That is the attitude that leads so many
Druids to refuse opportunities to group, to arrogantly train "safe"
areas, & etc.  That is the attitude that breeds the contempt so many
players feel for Druids, a contempt that is certainly well deserved by
those who have earned it.  I'm not saying that that's the way you play,
but that is the image you conjured.
