That was my Druids prefered patch until he leveled enough for IGs... even
when he could have been camping HGs in Rathe binding in SouthQ and porting
to NK meant I didn't even have to worry about weight, just the number of
slots I had spare for the belts.

It's actually a 4 point spawn, but most of the time each spawn pops a
double... so while you can have up to 8, you'll find 6 or 7 is more common.
