I'm under the impression that he intended to call someone a coward, and
"pussy" is an OK word for that, in my opinion. If he had called the person
a "cunt" or some such, that'd be different. But for calling someone a pussy
for starting something and then pulling out like a chicken, I don't think
that this deserves a suspension for 72 hours.

Good to hear from you, btw! I wondered where you had been.
