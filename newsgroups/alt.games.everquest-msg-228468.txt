I have a bunch of trash in my bank, and I'm considering whether or not it's
worth it to try and sell it in the bazaar.  My question is, does anyone use,
want or have need of banded armor anymore?  Other than nostalgia, does it
still have a purpose and should I just dump it off on a vendor or actually
try and sell it in the bazaar?

what about other low level, "old-school" gear?  Glowing wooden crook, runed
totem and the like?  Vendor trash now?

I just want to clear out the junk and consolidate.  Thank you for any input.
