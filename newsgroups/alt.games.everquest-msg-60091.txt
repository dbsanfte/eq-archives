This is a really stupid bug that Verant just can't seem to get a handle on.
It's MUCH better than it used to be, where Mend would consistently (I had it
do this 6 times in about 3 hours one night when the bug was prevalent)
bugger up.

Anyhow, it's got to do with the synchronization between the server and your
client. Basically, your client says you should be able to Mend, the server
says "Hey, wtf are you trying to do? You have to wait longer.", and you get
hooped out of using Mend. ;)

I found that the best way to avoid it is to wait 3-5 seconds after your Mend
hotkey pops to use it again. That *usually* solves the problem. Unless, of
course, you have an absolutely insane amount of lag. :)
