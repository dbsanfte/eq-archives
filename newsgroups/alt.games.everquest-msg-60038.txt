I don't mind the leather tunic look on my druid, which is good since
he's wearing Treeweave.   I really hated the leather sleeve look
though, which was also good since I was wearing a plat armband forever
and they have no graphic.  My friend referred to the sleeveless look
as the Chachi Arcola look.

Finally got some Ulthork arms, which don't look to bad. *shurg*

While I generally despise the way male wood elves look, I don't think
I've ever seen a female wood elf that looked bad.  But that could just
be me.  :-)
