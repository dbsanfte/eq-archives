At that level and with so few people, you could do the bank, but not the
arena.

Guards and Senior Guards at the arena entry have very low drop rates, and
armor drops only off of the storm giant types in grey armor, except for some
of the higher stuff like the tormax guards and things in the shiny gold
armor, but not the generic storm giants.  For any kind of noticeable drop
rate, you need to kill Lieutenants at the bank area, Korakaz near WL (very
low drop rate on him), Adjutants and Legionnaires, as well as Protectors of
Zek, Guardians of Zek, and Armor of Zek.  Also, Vindi's 2 guards (a temple
guardian) have fairly high drop rates.

I've gotten nearly a full suit of plate at the bank mostly solo as a (now)
59 druid.  Never saw arms or boots though.  Total tally is leather boots
(which I can't sell for 100pp), 2x chain boots (1 rotted, thx lore tag, sold
other for 1k), chain bracer (2k), plate bracer (3k), plate legs (to friend
for 4k, half of the going price), plate helm (to friend for 3k, half the
going price), plate BP (free to friend since we were grouped at the time),
plate gloves (1k), and silk arms (750).

And I still need my leather bp.
