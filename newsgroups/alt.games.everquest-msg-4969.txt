A while ago  another player asked for my help when she agroed an npc onto a
boat. I helped her and she proceded to run and I died. My body ended up
being tossed over boat when it zoned. It took me six hours to get it and
find my way out.  My question is.  I found out she is my mains guild now.
My character is EQ married to guild leader and is second in command...
Should i let her past run in with my alt matter in the guild?

i am trying to be unbiast but what comes to mind is her attitude when i
mentioned to her that my alt died (at the time of the incident ) and she
told me it wasn't her fault i didn't have to help her.  And that she can't
be blamed cause she had never been on that boat before to know an npc would
agress on her.

When i told her i wouldn't argue with her and that i would try to be
unbiast, tho she said she had changed. she started with that same attitude
again.  What should i do.
