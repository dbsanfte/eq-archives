AND that's my point, exactly... well, close anyway... I read the books a
LONG time ago... I LOVED them. I'm re-reading them now, after I've seen the
movie 5 times (6 after tonight), but I and perhaps most of the women who
post here (yeah, I realize they are far and few in between! and maybe I'm
wrong, but I don't think so) want to talk about what kind of eye candy the
producer/director/casting person provided us with! *I* certainly don't want
to argue the book to death. Personally, I don't *CARE* that they left this
thing or that thing out. It's a movie. They NEVER make movies the same as
the book (witness the fiascos of Stephen King's stuff on film!) But this
particular movie, the way it was made, the way it was cast, the scenery...
whatever it was... I didn't CARE that it was off. Oh shit, maybe I'm,
turning into a guy who just likes a movie (like Striptease, which sucked)
because of the eye candy...

ok, end of rant.

Sorry Ben. Just my libido getting out of control! ;)
