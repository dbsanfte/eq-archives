I totally understand the arguement, and I think you may be right.  It
may very well be worth it to keep the servers up and running to keep
up the perception of being the top dog.

This is why I think it'll take a while for subscriptions to actually
be cancelled, and numbers actaully dropping.  With package buys, this
may take a while to show, and some people may have tried other games
and come back without letting there current subscription lapse.

But I think that the decision will be made at an accounting level, not
a developer or marketing level, and this may force SOE's hand.  They
are part of a fairly large corp, after all, and they make decision
based purely on numbers a fair amount of the time.  Witness the
earlier than expected launch of EQ2.

So I don't see SOE shelling out large to keep a number of
half-populated servers up and running.  Not for long at least.

So here's the thing.  I think they'll probably d it soon, and probably
with the Zek's as Ben suggested.  Just as a trail run, to gauge
reaction, and see how smoothly it goes serverside.  They've probably
wanted to do that for a while anyways.

And I don't think we'll see a lot of 2-1 mergers.  I think we'd see a
merger or several servers at once it into something new. Say 3-4
underperformers all at once. I  think they might fold the young
servers together at the same time (Stromm and Morden Rasp).  The last
thing they want is it to be a drawn out process.  you don't want to
hear about another merged server every  couple weeks.  That gets real
demoralising real quick.  They'll probably wait as long as they can
and then do a mass fold once they've tested on the Zeks.

Now how my thinking translates into an actual calendar date?  Hard to
say.  But I'm not changing my bet.  I want that van =).
