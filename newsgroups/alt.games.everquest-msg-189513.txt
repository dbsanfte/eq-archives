    Quickest way to get to some slight money making:

    Go to the overthere, level up to about 37, then return to high keep and
start killing green guards. Guards drop some plat and fine steel weapons,
which you can sell to the erudite who sells chanter pets, no matter how KoS
you get. This is hideous faction but it got me most of my money before my
mid 40's

    Quickest way to get some real money:

    Go to the overthere, level up to 40 or 41, then go to dreadlands and
haul ass until maybe 45. Then go to rathe and learn to fear kite hill
giants. It's important to learn this BEFORE you hit 49 so that when you hit
49 and it becomes 6,109 times easier,

    a) you're an expert, which helps all sorts of things
    b) it feels so goddamn good killing them that easy that you obtain a
very high (+40) Boredom Resistance.

    Even at 45 hill giants are slow exp but decent cash. At 52 I would be
shocked if I didn't get 1k out of a c3 there.

    Something I found quite useful at 45 was buying a weighty polearm in the
bazaar for 250pp. Stats already beat the crap out of anything else I was
likely to be holding and got steadily better until level 50. I didn't try
hill giants between about 33 (suicide) and 45 but somewhere in there they
became doable, probably BEFORE 45, might be worth a try, especially if you
get that nashty weap.

Cheers,
James
