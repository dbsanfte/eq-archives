You are still violating the EULA, license, or whatever else you want to 
call the infernal thing. See my comment below.

Which is strictly forbidden by your license agreement with Verant/Sony.
Snip from eqlicense.txt: 

1. Accounts are available only to adults or, in their discretion, their 
minor child.  If you are a minor, your parent(s) or guardian(s) must 
complete the registration process, in which case they will take full 
responsibility for all obligations under this Agreement. By clicking the "I 
Accept" button and providing us with a credit card number, you represent 
that you are an adult and are either accepting this Agreement on behalf of 
yourself or your child. You may not transfer or share your Account with 
anyone, except that if you are a parent or guardian, you may permit one 
child to use the Account instead of you (in which case you may not use that 
Account). You are liable for all activities conducted through the Account, 
and parents or guardians are liable for the activities of their child. 
Corporations and other entities are not eligible to procure Accounts.
