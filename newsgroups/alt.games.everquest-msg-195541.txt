Half Elf faction was/is slightly inferior to Human, worse in more
places than it is better.  It used to matter, but nowadays when you
can get a pair of Opal Steins for 40pp or less, can gate aywhere via
PoK, and have lots of places where race has little or no impact on
faction, yes it is mostly irrelevent to a veteran player except
for achieving specific faction levels required for quests.
