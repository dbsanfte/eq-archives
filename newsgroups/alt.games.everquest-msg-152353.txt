Obviously you guys are mainly american / english (same isnt it?) Just so
rude. And u think u r pretty smart too.
Well, if u r so smart why dont u get a real life? EQ is so small compared to
real life.
And about mozzila i wasnt kidding, i really did most (well i was on testing
team and corrected most of the bugs.) That could be called re-designing --->
designing. Comprende?
Now, i have more things to do than waste my time on losers. I wont reply to
ur messages nor i will come to this forum anymore, so dont bother replying.
And about languages, if u were here u would be speaking goats language
(english) why the fuck should i be perfect on speaking urs? About the fee u
pay, i rather spend a day or two writing (i have friends) a crack for the
danm server.
