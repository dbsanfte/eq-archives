It's ArolPIN, no h please.  And yep, I did scoff at you.  My rather 
unscientific testing is very, very clear that resists over 255 still allow 
you resist while resists of 100 lead to lots of damage.  Try it next time 
you're in ToV.  Have no resist gear or buffs on, watch how often you get 
hit.  Now gear and buff above 255 and watch.  It's a very, very noticable 
difference.
