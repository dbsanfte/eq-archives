   /shrug That's always a possibility.  It had the ring of truth to me,
but what the hell do I know?  The follow ups he does afterwards also
seem to strike the right note .

   However, if he is a troll.. well, IMHO he a pretty good one.  So many
fall on the side of pathetic, overused garbage that we've seen over and
over and over again.  This seems to be a fairly original take to me, and
I think it is convincingly done.

   But yeah.  It would be nice if someone well known on FV (and
preferably known to me personally) would step up to the plate and say
they know of some of the names mentioned, or some knowledge of the
events spoken of.  I'll keep watching the thread and hoping someone
comes forward.
