Funny you should mention that. I was bound in Perma for one of the
recent raids, figuring that since I was almost certainly going to be
killed, perhaps I could at least mem a few quick spells and rejoin the
fray in time to make a difference.

Interesting theory, anyway.

The raid was a total cluster, and some moron decided to pull the
giants (a big part of the reason the raid was a cluster) to where I
had bound - which is otherwise a fairly safe spot. I died three times
before I unplugged the computer.

Maybe in a few days when I get over the aggravation, I'll do a rant
about the crummy raid leadership I saw. It was so bad that even I, a
Vox Raid Virgin, was able to see the flaws.

Ugh.
