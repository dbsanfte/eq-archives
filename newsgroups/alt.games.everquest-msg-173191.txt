The war in Afghanistan was (or still is) military action to root out 
terrorists. I supported it at the time, and still do. On the other hand, 
nobody has established a clear link between the Iraqi regime and Al 
Qaeda, so forgive me if I suspect ulterior motives. In fact, the 
strongest Al Qaeda links are within countries that are currently allies 
of the US.

I'm no friend of Saddam Hussein, and I think he should have been deposed 
back in '91, and as far as I'm concerned the US is more than welcome to 
finish the job now. I just don't believe for a second this has anything 
to do with terrorism, other than the fact that will be used by 
terrorists as a recruiting pitch, of course.

There is no solution to terrorism. You simply try to prevent as much as 
you can and deal with the rest as well as you can. I've heard more than 
a few ETA bombs go off as I grew up in Madrid, I've seen the craters and 
the bloodstains, and I've feared for relatives of mine who are in the 
military. This doesn't make my opinion on terrorism any more valid than 
anybody else's, of course, but when you berate Europeans for their 
cynical attitude to this war, bear in mind we've been dealing with 
terrorism since *long* before 9/11/01.
