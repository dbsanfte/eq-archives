I have a 23 Provisioner.  Players don't yet understand what good food and 
drink are so sales tend to be pretty slow.  However, as average game 
knowledge goes up, I expect it'll be a much better field for me.  Meanwhile 
I'm having fun leveling much faster than my adventurer AND having food and 
drink handy. :)

Provisioning has, I believe, the distinction of being the only class that 
doesn't need the help of any other class.  For instance, I also make maple 
strong boxes (people see the use of those right away :) ) and I can't make 
the Iron Sheets...that's an Outfitter recipe (Provisioner is a subclass of 
Craftsman, not Outfitter).

I tried buying the Outfitter 10 book but it wouldn't let me scribe it.  I 
don't know if I did something wrong (I did scribe the scholar 10 book a few 
weeks before) or if Sony fixed that obvious exploit.

I've told my friend who is interested in wood working (furniture) that I 
think that's going to be THE money-maker when folks start getting cash to 
spend (read: powerlevelers and uberguilders).
