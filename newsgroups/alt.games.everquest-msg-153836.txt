That depends on the type of healer you have available.  If you don't
have Cheal, then its not the HP total that matters, its the damage
per minute.  See my other posts for why, but in short, I'd
rather heal someone taking 300 damage per minute than
someone taking 500 damage per minute.  The fact that the
monk might only have 2700 hp left to go(out of 3000) when I heal him,
versus a warrior who might have 4000 hp left to go (out of 4500,
half again the 3000 total for the monk) won't matter much at all,
unless I go OOM and we have to watch the pair slowly run out
the clock hoping I get mana for more heals or the mob dies.
If I DO get mana for heals, its going to go 5/3rds as far on that
monk as it would on the warrior!
