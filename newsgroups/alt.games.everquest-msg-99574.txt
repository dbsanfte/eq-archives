If all you're concerned with is NFP for the banking, etc. there is a
faster way. Keep your ears open for a Lucan raid. (If you see a bunch of
high levels in W. FP newbie area, ask. There's a good chance that's why
they are there.)

When they pull Lucan, just ask if you can get in one shot. Pop him with
an arrow or take a single whack at him. Then hang around for the faction
hit. One or two Lucans will make you VERY popular in NFP. Of course,
you're instantly KOS in East and West, but screw them anyway.
