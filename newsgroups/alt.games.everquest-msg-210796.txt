If an item has a required level, you can't equip it unless you are at least
that level.  If the required level is 46, you must be 46 to equip it.  That
doesn't mean you can't buy it and keep it in on you or in the bank, ready
for when you do achieve the required level.

If an item has a recommended level, you can equip it if you aren't the
recommended level, but you won't get the full benefit.  For example, a
Bellows Crafted Cap has a +5 wisdom if you are at least the recommended
level of 50.  It's been awhile, but I think if you are under 50 you only get
+4 wisdom.  Unfortunately, I don't think places like Allakhazam always, or
even usually, list the reduced stats you get if you don't meet the
recommended level.  The best thing I know to do is go to the bazaar and
search for the item and look at the detailed description for it.  If you
don't meet the recommended level, you'll see the reduced stats for it in
parentheses (or vice versa, it should be pretty obvious).  That's the
benefit you'll get from it until you meet the recommended level.

Another thing to watch out for is the minimum level required for items that
proc an effect or have a right click spell effect, i.e. Dark Ember is a 1HB
weapon that has the ability to proc a spell for additional damage when used
in combat and Elder Spirits Vambraces allow you to cast Drones of Doom by
right clicking on the item's image icon in your inventory window.  You can
usually equip these items at a level well below the level that is required
for you to be able to successfully use the proc/right click spell.  For
example, you can start using Dark Ember from level 1, but you won't proc the
DD spell for additional damage until you are level 35.  You can equip the
Vambraces at level 1, but can't successfully use them to case Drones of Doom
until level 46.  You can find the minimum level to proc or right-click cast
for an item by looking it up at Lucy.Fnord.Net.
