Swimming will be a critical skill later on, depending on which zones you
want to hunt in. Can you travel safely in Freeport? I maxed my troll's
swimming skill there finally in the pool outside of the Office of the
People in North Freeport. Just jump in, hit autorun, swim into a corner
in that pool, and stay there. No, you will NOT drown regardless of what
your stamina is. I've done this now with both my troll warrior (STA well
over 100) and my human necro (stamina 80 or so). Yellow stamina bar goes
to zero, and you stil keep swimming. I left them there and went and
watched a movie. Came back, and swim skill was maxed.
