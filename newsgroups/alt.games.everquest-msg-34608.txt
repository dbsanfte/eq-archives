I challenge you to name three better places to get exp than
Crushbone in the five to ten range...assuming you are looting
belts and running them to Kaladim occaisionally.

Orc Hill in Gfay sucks, but Crushbone entrance in GFay
and Crushbone exit in Crushbone are both quite nice lowbie
areas to begin with, and the common drop of substantial
experience belts roughly doubles your exp per hour.

Trick is to hunt till you have maxed out your skills, then
run the belts you've collected in to finish up your level
quickly, then return and repeat.

Occaisionally you will die from a train or a miscalculation
on your part... but at those levels you lose so little exp that
the main irritant is the run back from your bind point.

Only way you could convince me that this -isn't- one of the
best lowbie deals going would be if you wanted a place to
play during peak hours.  Yep, the lower level stuff is hunted
to extinction during those hours... but the same would be true
of the ever popular BB and EC orc camps.  Once upon a
time I'd have made an arguement for Befallen as the great
lowbie peak hours zone, but thats apparantly been ruined
recently.
