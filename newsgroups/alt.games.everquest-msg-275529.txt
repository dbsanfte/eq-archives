 Maybe SOE should incorporate a /whine command for you guys.I can't
believe some of the childish responses I have read here regarding the
patch and how it has ruined your character. You seem to overlook the
numerous good things SOE has brought into the game .If they take
anything away from your character then you threaten to quit and say
that your switching to WoW. Well , go right ahead and go to WoW ,that
would leave EQ2 with a few less whiners. EQ2 is the best RPG on the
planet and I dislike some of there nerfs as well , but I don't go
around whining about them .A game as complex as EQ2 requires
adjustments now and then to balance out the classes. If something gets
nerfed it is usually for the better overall game,and unfortunately
sometimes individual players get screwed in the process .But as a great
Vulcan once said , "The needs of the many, outweigh the needs of the
few , or the one. "
  But all hope is not lost. In dealing with SOE the last 5 years the
one thing I admire about them is they listen to their players .They
want more than anyboby to have the best game on the market.So instead
of flaming SOE on websites,perhaps you should try the /feedback command
in game and let them know how you feel in an adult and kind manner . If
there nerf overly effects a certain area of the game ,they will get
enough feedback on it and readjust it.
