Give this a go a new Everquest like web based game, start cities
recruit members, battle myself and thousands of other players, lol
it's great fun, but does make you spam a little bit(

Anyway here it is http://go.everwars.com/play.x?p=2026 great for when
you are stuck at work click and kill a few friends and post the battle
logs on your guildwebsite for some fun )

Most of all start a character ! we want more ppl to fight !
