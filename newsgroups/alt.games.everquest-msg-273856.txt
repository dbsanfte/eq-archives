a character called "rapeme".  Why ask a silly question like that when anyone
who's played the game for 3 hours knows full well they exist and worst is
used in chat.

As another person native to the language, you're exaggerating the situation,
to the point of being dishonest.

Pussy is more commonly used with regard to being timid, other meanings are
also derived from the cat family:

s/he's a pussy cat
s/he's a real tiger
lion hearted
 and the list goes on.  As for "only slightly" less offensive - you're
trying to pull our legs, used in that regard it is a hell of a lot less
offensive.  As it is I've never heard anyone called a "pussy" as a toned
down version of "cunt" and I bet you haven't either.

please provide a recognised source as a citation, because I don't believe

Rubbish, when used to describe a person, "pussy" means coward.  If it means
anything else I'm sure you'd be able to cite a film or book where "pussy"
has been used as an alternative way of calling a person a "cunt".

Heaven forbid anyone call you an "eager beaver" for running to the AH when
you log on.
