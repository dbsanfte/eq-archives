Where do you read that in?

Possibly, but that does not negate the fact that the Ten Commandments are
significant in legal heritage and precident.

The fact that you refuse to accept it does not make it any less so.  The
posting of the Ten Commandments has absolutely no bearing on whatever legal
proceedings happen in a court.  They are not enforceable.  Hence, it is a
safe middle ground:  it serves as an anchor to our heritage, for those who
like it, while not having any official standing for those who don't.

I would accept it.
