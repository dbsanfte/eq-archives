Howdy,

  I just want to let out a quick rant.  It's about blaming others for
pulling a train.  My lvl 12 Necro has finally gotten powerful enough to go
poking deep into Black Burrow and I've discovered that by now, I don't like
gnolls, they really dislike me, and when I have a pet they aggro on it (then
me) like there is no tomorrow.
  Here's what I'm getting at...It's tough enough for me to walk around, and
I've found that the following is quite common.  I find some low level
character being chased by large trains of higher level gnolls and they get
dumped on me.  They easily overpower my pet, so I run for the zone.  Upon
reaching the zone I rest and watch wounded souls zone in and start accusing
me of training.
  I'm not saying I've never started a train, but I've been accused of it
MUCH more than I've haphazardly created one.  The comment of "nice train"
followed by a "hehe" or so I can deal with, but sometimes people really get
pissed (big babies!) and can't let it go.  Sometimes threaten to report me
to GM.  Big deal!  It's BB and I see others pulling trains all the time.
Some nights it's one after another.
  I just don't understand why people get so upset.  It's a game.  If I want
to hear whining and sniveling I'll log off EQ and talk to the wife, lol.
  That's all...I feel better now.
