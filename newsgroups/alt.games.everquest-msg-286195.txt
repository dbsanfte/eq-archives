Ugh!

The task bar is the standard Windows task bar: Start, Quicktime, Show 
Desktop, Sonic MyDVD, Windows Media Player, Launch IE Browser, icons for 
programs minimized, Norton, Windows Messenger, Local Area Connection, Norton 
Internet Security, Time

I used these two codes and I lost the task bar in game.

But, it is gone from my browser window also.  I NEED it there.  How can I 
get that back?
