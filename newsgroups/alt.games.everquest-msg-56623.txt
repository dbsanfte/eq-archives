Something got hosed with this patch, cuz I managed to log in  only to
find that all my chars were gone! Quickly created a dummie to send a
"WTF" petition, but crashed to the desktop while entering world.

My guess is there is a server backup/restore being done, with or
without patch or emergency patch of patch....

No problem, IMHO, as long as my BigUgliee's still scratch their
posteriors and my dwarf remains passed out somewheres...

But IF my char's been wiped, how does one spell "cancel my account"?
