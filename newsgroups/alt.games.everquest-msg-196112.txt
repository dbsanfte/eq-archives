For those levels I would try RunnyEye.  A 15 would have diffculty but as a
group, you could start out on the top floor.  And if you have a couple 34+
healer/buffers then you should be fine.  Then as you level you could
gradually move to the lower floors.  I really liked this dungeon when I was
in my 20s.  You can pratice several RAIDING techniques in the dugeon.  If
you went to one of the lower rooms and cleared it then you could show the
newbies how to camp a room.  You could show how not to create a Train.  If
you start running from a mob in this Dungeon you will definitely create a
train.  Also the Goblins have a tendency to run away pretty qucikly when
they are almost dead so you can pratice how to keep a mob from running away
from you.  All of this plus the Dungeon is hardly camped anymore.  Oh, and
there are decent weapon and armor drops in the dungeon that an untwinked
newbie would be happy to have.  And in the basement of the dungeon there is
a Goblin Banker who you can actually do business with.
