Yup. They listened to all the crafters whining they didn't want to go
begging for oils/resins/etc from alchemists.

Of course, listening to the community usually a crappy way to run a
game. It results in a Massively Multiplayer Monty Haul Campaign. It's
worth noting that for all the whining people have done about how SOE
'doesn't care waht people want', EQ is still around, while a lot of
other games started with the basis of 'giving gamers what they ask
for' have flopped utterly. (Horizons, anyone? Remember when that was
going to 'kill' Ultima Online, way back when it was first announced in
the dim recesses of time?)
