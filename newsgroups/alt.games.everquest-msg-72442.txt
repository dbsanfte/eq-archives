I haven't tried quading in CS (hell...I've only been to CS once), but
the way I quad is round up 4 by using my Staff of Temperate Flux to
get their attention, and then running them around with my jboots until
they are all together, and then getting ahead of them, and then
stopping and mashing on the "Atol's Spectral Shackles" key until it
casts, and pray that none of them resist.  If there are no resists,
they are all snared with one cast.

Do most quading wizards snare the mobs individually?
