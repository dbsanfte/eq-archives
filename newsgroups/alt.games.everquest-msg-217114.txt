    The AA's are important, but the gear is even more important. Is the SK
with 50 AA's also in elemental/VT gear, or is he dressed in smithed cultural
and Kunark armour? Makes a big difference, as the mobs mitigate slow and
aren't total pushovers once it lands.

    Pacification is resisted a lot in Hard, so I'm guessing bard lull is as
well.

    Most elemental-geared groups that try "hard" encounter some difficulty.
As Faned pointed out, stuff hits hard and mistakes are usually fatal. If you
aren't concerned with your win/loss record, I suggest getting a "hard"
adventure (either Rescue or Slaughter) and just try some pulls to see if you
can handle it. In particular, see if you can handle multiples and if so how
many. That should give you a very good idea of if you can complete an
adventure period, and more specifically it should tell you if you have a
chance against the mini-bosses in Hard. Again, if you don't care about your
win/loss ratio it might be very worth your while to farm Hard adventures for
the loot drops.
