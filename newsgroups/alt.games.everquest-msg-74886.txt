This is a good example of why I sometimes need to use pickpocket when
grouped.  I get sick of seeing the tanks grab the stuff and we should all
encourage maximum Med time.  So, I pick a 'fair share' and hand it to the
non-looters during downtime.  It helped me get my PP up for when I do my
epic, the casters got loot, and the monks get straight platinum.
Win-win-win.
