Aloha Lokari,
    Well thank /agnostic for that. I can only imagine the hoops folks 
must be jumping through to get Lucin to work. I'm an 'old guy' and 
didn't mind forking over the extra ram to max out my PIII800 at 512k. 
But that's apparently not enough. I also discovered that my ATI 7200 64 
meg video card isn't supported. Now that part was handled this evening 
with the purchase of the 8500.  Perhaps the text outside the 'hot 
buttons' and the bizarre effect of seemly stepping through myself when I 
hit something , will go away.  In February I should be able to up-grade 
my motherboard with something that supports more than a gig of ram and a 
P4. Still I wonder if I need a machine with that much 'herc' to run 
Everquest what most folks are gonna have to live with. - Redakamai, of 
the twenty-first season
