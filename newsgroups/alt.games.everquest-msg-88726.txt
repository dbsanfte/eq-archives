Concur. My machine (once again) is one of the "lucky ones" that runs
great all over the old worlds and most of the moon. The bazaar is the
one place it gets quite jerky, framerate-wise. Tiru's machine is iffy in
a lot of Luclin zones and the bazaar is a fucking nightmare. No clue why
either, because it's just the same if I'm the *only* person in there.
