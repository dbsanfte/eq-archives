Hi there,

as I am working on my epic, I wondered about a few things that
I didn't quite get, even if the guides out there are 
wonderfully detailed:

1) Test of patience. Does invis to animals work for a level 47 
   (or did it work for a shaman < 47) against Killer Sharks
   in Eruds Crossing? This would allow being invis and talking
   to the NPC's udnerwater without danger.

2) The pages and books to loot in City of Mist: The guide says
   'These identify as XYZ'. Does this mean you need a caster
   with identify spell to find the right number and types
   of pages? Or was this merely meaning the scrolls and books
   are naming themselves (er, just normal loot .. like a
   spell componend 'Word of ...')

3) I am now near Kithicor ... is there a place to get fish scales
   on my way to Eruds Crossing (forgot to get them off the
   barracudas in cabilis and only have 4 left for the
   quest underwater part... dumb me)
