It should be your first stop.

Keep in mind Paludal is a bit feisty. Quarrels break out all the time
at the bandits that you would be fighting. It had gone completely FFA
on both servers I had played in there - pull em as you see em, no
camps, no quarter.

Not as bad as say, Highpass prekunark, but not exactly the paragon of
maturity either.

You never will. And I mean *never*. Warslik makes computers go "stop
the pain!" for a lot of people, and its not a great place to fight in
general with all the trees and hills. You get the occasional
giantkiller, along with a L30 or two killing at the entrance to
Dalnir, not much else.


> Guess I'll try to make my way to Paludal Caverns after a bit.

I would. But Paludal isn't your only option, just your best. Ill Omen
and Overthere still have people. South Karana, the old standby, still
has a few people (who else remembers the days of 80 people at the
treehouse?). I forget what level the little shrooms in Dawnshroud
were, but they were good exp in their day. Netherbian is another
option, though that zone is just awful experience for some reason.

Oh yeah, I'm still retired and I will stay that way. :-)
