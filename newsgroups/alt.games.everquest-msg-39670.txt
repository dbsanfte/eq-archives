I have to say that I do not understand the problem here.  The Done button is
nowhere near the Buy or Sell button.  I do sometimes just walk away from the
merchant, but other times, I am buying trade supplies to use, and intend to
buy more when I am done.  I have accidentally sold the wrong thing to a
merchant a couple of times, but this was due to the identical appearance of
objects, and my not checking what I was actually selling.  I don't do that
anymore.
