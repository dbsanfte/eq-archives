In the heat of the moment I think exactly like you... but I know I react
easily (and harshly).. so for my own sake, I try to cool down for 5 mins
before doing anything. (well i may send them /tells, but i wont seek out
mobs to train them)

It was always nice to have a good rep, nobody sees me as a trainer, and I've
never been called one on the server message boards etc - hopefully it makes
a difference should it ever matter...
