I really doubt that. Since SoE made the ae songs useless bards are
limited to their chants. And four chants with ~190/Tick each isn't
extremely impressive. Especially given the HP the mobs you kite for exp
usually have. Though OoW chants does have higher damage mob hp has
increased too. :)

And since the new charm is not usable for swarm kiting even this option
is out. So bards are best off looking for groups now. I might give chant
kiting a new chance once /melody is live on the german server...
