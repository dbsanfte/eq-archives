I normally can't see any reason to spent any time getting AA points before 
60 (unless you're staying at 52 for Vox/Naggy drops), UNLESS you're a 
warrior.  I've been noticing the difference that 3 points in run speed 
makes when pulling, and it's just absolutely insane.  I was with a guild 
group in Akheva last night, and our warrior was pulling the mind burrowers 
by just outrunning all but the one he wanted.  We were pulling them almost 
non-stop, while another guild of similarly leveled people was getting 
wiped out because their puller couldn't get enough distance from the 
pulls.  
If you're the puller in dungeons, and you do a lot of dungeon work, then 
it may make some sense to put you points in run speed.  Otherwise, I agree 
wtih James, wait until 60.
