It wouldn't be possible to do, period. You need a group of at least 4
to even gain access into one of the dungeons. The mobs in the dungeon
you're given access to are based off the average level of your group.
Now, the 3 others can all disband and log off and you'll still be able
to get in, but I guarantee you won't be succeeding in the goal of the
adventure alone.
