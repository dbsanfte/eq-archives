That's misleading - there is no percentage exp modifier for zones.

The formula for base XP given by a mob is
ML * ML * ZEM * GB

Where
ML = Mob Level
ZEM = Zone Experience Modifier
GB = Group bonus.

This is further multiplied by the HCB (High Con Bonus,
when the player is >=50, and the mob is > Max(55, PL-5) where
PL is Player Level.

A ZEM is a whole number, ranging from a low of 65 in LoIO
to a high of 160 in Paludal.

An example - a group of 55's taking a level 64 Kriger in BoT
ZEM = 119
ML = 64
GB = 2.16 (a rewording of GB = 1.8 for 5 people and the 6th is
free)
HCB =1.95 + ((64-60)*.13) = 2.47

XP per person is
(PL+5)/((Sum_levels)+(Sum_players*5))
for 6 of the same level this equals 1/6

So (64*64*119*2.16)*(1/6)*2.47 = 433,417 XP per person per Kriger.

The percentages you see come from a patch message where they
boosted the ZEM's of "underutilized" zones, and reflects the
percent they were boosted.

This info came from the Knightsofloyalty site which got all its
info from Hackersquest - and has been born out by observation.
