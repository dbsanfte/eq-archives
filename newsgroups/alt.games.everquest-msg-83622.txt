We're in EJ at the moment and it's ok, although my pally friend is a
bit, um, directionally challenged and I'm never sure when she runs off
to pull something if I'll ever see her again.  Nothing more
frustrating than seeing her hit point bar going down and down without
any idea where she is :/

We are _hugely_ more effective when the bard joins us.  Bards bring so
much to the party.  Unfortunately, he's not always on when we are.

Thanks to all who responded, some good ideas here.
