I have made the run from the ME zone to the spot where you pull the Elysians
to fully visible with zero agro, it's just a question of keeping your eyes
open, and avoiding the mobs.  It's even easier invisible.  You turn right
after zoning in, and follow the zone wall, hit the corner, continue
following the zone wall, make a wide enough berth around the VT entrance,
and continue on a bit to a spot on the zone wall with a hill paralleling it.
That valley is where you will likely be killing the Elysians.  The Elysians
themselves are just over the hill.  Good luck.  You do need to watch for
mobs as you head to that spot, as some do see invis, just stay high on the
zone wall, except for next to VT, and you should be fine.
