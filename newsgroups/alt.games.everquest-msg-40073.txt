Geh, if you're talking about that practice research quest, quit
wasting your time and money. Ultimately, it is MUCH cheaper and less
frustrating to spend the points at your trainer. The money you could
make selling the components that you dump into those practice runes
would _more_ than cover the cost the trainer asks for for spending
those points. All the practice runes are are a money sink and a source
of endless frustration.

If you're thrown off by the fact you can't spend any more points
beyond the first at your trainer at level 16, this is normal... The
level cap for research is pitifully low: (lvl-15)*5.

Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead. Do not walk ahead of me, for I 
may not follow. Do not walk beside me, either. Leave me the hell alone.
