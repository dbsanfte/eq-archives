This is something a guy who works with me wrote about /consider. Maybe
you'll find it amusing. Or not.

The /consider command and truth in advertising.

Bjyrn just made a highly unsuccessful foray into the Overthere. I had
forgotten how much harder the Kunark mobs hit than their old world
counterparts. In a way, it was reminiscient of the feeling when you hit
the higher levels and even greens become serious threats. Musing on
this led me to speculate on what the creatures are REALLY trying to
tell you with that /consider message...

GREEN: Haha! Right now you're wondering just HOW green, right? If i'm
really green, you might have a chance. Of course you won't get any
experience if you do win, but on the bright side I've got eight silver
pieces or so of loot. So, do you feel lucky?

BLUE: You brought some friends, right? Good. I wouldn't want you to
have no one to talk to while you are running back here to find your
corpse. Try not to die somewhere hard to see, remember to get a loc,
and I hope you bound somewhere nearby. You may now assume the position.

EVEN: Ahhhh! The delicious irony! Theoretically we are the same level,
but I can whip your ass with one limb tied behind my back. Frustrating,
isn't it? Just so you know, after your excruciating demise I intend to
dance on your corpse and sing an annoying little victory song. And then
I'm going to sit here on top of your body for about an hour just to
aggravate you some more.

YELLOW: Oh boy, now you've done it. I quad hit for about a third of
your hit points. Do the math brainboy. Bring a mop when you do your
corpse recovery. The smart thing would be to start running now. Well,
actually about 3 seconds ago. Yeah, I've got one of those LOS aggro
ranges.

RED: Look, if you want to know where you are bound just type /charinfo
and stop bothering me. I just finished a full group of people five
levels higher than you, and all I want to do right now is find a sunny
spot and sleep off this full stomach. So get lost.
