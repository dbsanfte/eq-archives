As a counter-counter argument :-P

Hybrids aren't "spoiled" as much as a pure caster by KEI. Your
Paladin's main job is to tank mobs. For him gear and mob selection are
more important than total mana pool and mana regen rate. As you noted
KEI significantly reduced your downtime, but it did not significantly
alter how you play the class.

Now contrast the above with a Wizard or Cleric. Both of these two
classes live and die on total mana pool and mana regen. Both classes
suffer when the people playing them grow up on KEI and never learn how
to function efficiently with more limited resources. I am certain we
will see a LOT of poorly played casters (assuming the KEI-Twinks keep
playing) that will have to learn the nuances of mana management.
Pick-up groups are gonna get a lot more ugly for a while :-(
