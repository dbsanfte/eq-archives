I've got a few minor quibbles with some of this list,
but overall my reaction is, "GIVE THIS MAN A JOB AT VERANT!"

I'd like to see thrown weapons (and/or shot arrows) have a chance
of ending up on the ground beneath the NPC if they miss, or appear
in the NPC's loot table if they hit.  (But not all thrown/shot weapons,
since some will be irretrievably lost or broken when flung.)

This only makes RP sense, some of your arrows/spears will still be
usable after being flung, and could be plucked out of the mob's
dead body and reused.  Likewise for the ones that missed and ended
up landing on the ground.

I've wanted this for a very long time.

Yes, you could just ask, but it's a pain (for both the asker and
the answerer), plus sometimes people don't respond honestly.

My main use for this would be, "Are there any clerics in nearby zones
who I could hire to come rez me?"  (Or similarly for necros when
I need a corpse summoned, etc.)

It would be extremely useful.

Tip:  Each social can be used to store 5 lines of notes...

It would be nice to have a smoother way of notetaking, though.

I'd like "in-game email".  At the bank, you should be able to leave
a message for <charname>, which they will be given when they next
visit the bank themselves.  Like leaving a message at the front desk
in a hotel.
