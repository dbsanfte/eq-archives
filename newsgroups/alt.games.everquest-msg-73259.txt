For those of us that use English as our primary language, and probably many
that do not, it is harder to read 'u' and 'ur' rather than 'you' and 'your',
merely because we have been brought up reading and writing in English.
While I won't ask you to change your writing style, that is your business, I
will choose not to respond to a post that is difficult for me to read,
unless it is obvious to me that English is not the posters' native tongue,
and he or she is making an attempt at writing comprehensibly.
