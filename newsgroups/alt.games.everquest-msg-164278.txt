 Why can't he/she? How many people got to level 60 and didn't have all
their spells? Or when when Luclin came out. How many enchanters out
there that still don't have KEI or whatever? A level 65 person can play
just fine with level 62 spells. Spectral is 63-64 so your 60-61 above
isn't entirely accurate.
