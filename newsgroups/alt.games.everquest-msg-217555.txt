Yesterday, we did a level 65 group:

Cleric
Shaman
Beastlord
Mage
Ranger
Ranger

As the cleric, I pacify-pulled. The rangers both tanked. The pets did
lockdown. Single pulling was too easy, so I went to deliberate
two-pulls. We got a few four-pulls, which we handled easily. The whole
mission was done in 54 minutes.

After that, we switched out the shaman and one of the rangers for a
paladin and a monk. We let the monk try to split-pull. Big mistake. We
failed on time and had to do four rezzes.

Now, I'm in favor of two clerics if you can't get CC--one to pacify
pull and one to heal.
