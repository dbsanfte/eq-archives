Well a full suit gives around 50 AC! Not inconsiderable AC by any
means, honestly sweated for *and* cost you nothing - at newbie level,
a 14AC breastplate is pretty cool, I reckon. The weapon is a bit poor,
at 5 damage, but its Magic, which isn't bad, plus the bane damage to
gnolls will be handy in Blackburrow.

Well done on getting it, too - I have never had the patience, but I
may well give it a try, after being inspired by your example  :)
