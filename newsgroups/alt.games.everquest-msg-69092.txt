Nothing evidently if your chars stamina is at least 100. If its lower
than 100 when you run out of stamina you will be hitting visibly
slower.

Wurmy is kind of the realm of large race melee types who are more
likely to have at least 100 stamina. I think my troll sk has like 120
base stamina and in the crustacean plate and other gear she has on she
is at 198 stamina currently. Wielding a wurmy for her is like some
races wielding a dagger. Even in prolonged fights her stamina still
has some left in it. Of course dual wielding something and a wurmy you
lose stam faster.
