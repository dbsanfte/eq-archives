All i can tell you is my experience with a similar setup. I have a
cable modem that runs to an XP machine and all are connected through a
hub as well (no router - bahh - but I got the 16 port hub for free
from work) and the XP is set up to use ICS. We used to have 2 XP and 2
98SE machines on the network. Quite often, the 98SE machines would
experience HUGE packet loss and were quite unplayable. AFter a few
reboots of the 98SE machines, it would work sometimes. Oddly, if we
booted up the systems in a particular order, it would work most of the
time. Since then, weve upgraded all the systems to XP and experience
no problems at all now. When the network was entirely 98SE, there were
no problems. I believe I read that even a mixed network on a router
had similar problems. If thats true, then it sounds like XP and 98
dont play well together networking wise - but thats pure speculation.
