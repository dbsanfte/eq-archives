We're going to attempt to take her down on 7/1 if she's up...but from
hunting in Skyfire I'm down to dubious with her.  I think it's only a matter
of a small amount of time before I'm KOS as well.

But hey, SF is the only outdoor zone in Kunark that drops high level spells.
I bothers me a LITTLE to ruin my faction with her, but not everyone loves to
dungeon crawl every night just for experience. :-p
