As far as I'm concerned, the player who uses a bug in the game is just
playing the game. If they don't want it being "exploited", then fix
the damn bug!!! You could make an argument that they were roleplaying.
I mean, if dragons realy existed and you could fight one in a position
where he couldn't attack you back, wouldn't you do that?

I saw an interview with an F15 pilot one time where he was commenting
on the radars in current flight simulation games. They are known to be
too powerful, much more so than in real life. Some folks thought that
was cheating. He commented that he would cheat all he could in real
life as that could mean the difference between life and death.

Verant, let them play!
