    Some don't need SoW, and some are greatly reduced in efficiency without
it. Let me give an example: my monk solos in the giant fort in FM a lot.
Modus operandi: run up to a low blue giant, bonk it, run back to a safe
wall, run parallel to the wall a short ways (to get the mob as close to the
wall as possible), beat it up. Without SoW, I usually take in the
neighbourhood of 200 extra damage pulling. I can back up when pulling to
reduce this damage, but I find I get adds too easily if not paying strict
attention to where I'm going - and then I Feign out, my pull adds to some
other poor fellow's pull, and problems abound. 200 damage for a non-Fungi
monk who only has 1100 HPs to begin with is a lot of extra downtime - so I
purchase SoW.

    But that's what gets me - I PURCHASE SoW. I find a druid in/around the
fort (not by /who druid), go up to them, and when they aren't engaged in
combat ask if, mana allowing, I can purchase a SoW. I never give less than 1
plat (although I will usually pay in gold - hey, I *am* a monk), and
although I haven't been told "no" yet if I was I'd thank them for their time
and go try and find someone else. The sense of entitlement some players have
for buffs just astounds me sometimes.
