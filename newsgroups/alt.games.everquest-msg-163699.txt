Here's how fear kiting works:

Cast snare on target.
Target starts in your direction (hopefully slowly)
Cast fear on target
Target stops moving your way and starts "running"
You beat on it, your pet beats on it, any groupmates you've got beat on it.
Fear breaks
Mob turns and begins trying to turn someone into paste
You try to channel fear again (he did pick you, didn't he?)
You look for a rez

Here's how it would work IF you could stack fears
Cast snare on target.
Target starts in your direction (hopefully slowly)
Cast fear on target
Target stops moving your way and starts "running"
Your pet beats on it, any groupmates you've got beat on it.
You cast second fear
One of the fears breaks
You replace it, since the mob is still fleeing.
Repeat until mob dead.

This would make fear kiting much easier and safer.  Personally I doubt that they
DO stack, but wouldn't it be nice.
