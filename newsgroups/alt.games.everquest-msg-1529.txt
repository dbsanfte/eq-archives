Hey all, just wanted to share a little accomplishment I pulled off last
night.

I suddenly hit a wall with my main character and got bored very fast. Odd,
considering I had just gotten my Trueshot Longbow and was eager to begin bow
kiting with it. Anyway ... had a level 1 Druid sitting in Qeynos that I had
only logged with once, never doing a damn thing with it.

So I logged and said, hey, I'll do the Qeynos to Freeport run. I had
attempted it with my main when he was level 6 and got my rear handed to me a
few times. Never attempted it since, and have been ported around by my guild
instead. My intention was to do this without any ports and without any
buffs.

Off I went. People in Qeynos Hills thought I'd never make it. Bare as the
day I logged, I took off. Western and Northern Karana were both a cakewalk.
Took the river all the way down, only leaving it to skirt around a few
raiders on NK. Got to East Karana and somebody dropped a SoW on me. DOH! I
graciously thanked him, never telling him that it took a small bit away from
my quest, and moved on to Highold by cutting through the middle of the zone.
This was supposed to be the hardest leg, based on all I had read.

Zipped through Highold with ease. I had never been there before and did not
use a printed map, nor did I /shout for directions, yet somehow I made every
turn correctly. Ran into one gnoll (summoner?) who was already engaged,
where I sprinted past. The entrance to Kith was camped, making the danger
nil.

Got to Kith at about 3-4 a.m. game time, so I knew it was still dangerous. I
thought about logging for a short while to let day approach, but decided
against it. Again, it would take away from the quest. Nary a close call all
the way through, skirting the north wall. Had to pause for one Bixie who was
YTM, but made it to West Commonlands easily.

My SoW ran out as I hit the tunnel to WC, but when I zoned, another guy
threw one on me. DOH! Again, much thanks for the kindness. As I chatted with
him about the futility behind my quest, a skelly jumped me from behind. One
hit, I was at half health. I bolted, he took on the skelly, and that was
that. My closest call. Took the sand wall all the way to EC, and had a
veritable cake walk to Freeport.

I considered hopping the boat and continuing on to Ak'Akon, just to add to
the boast, but by then it was late and I had a hectic day of work to look
forward to the next day. Maybe I'll log and finish the journey tonight ...
but it just wouldn't be the same.

So there you go. Ding-a-ling, did the Qeynos to Freeport run with
bare-as-bones level 1, with only two SoWs on the way. Not bad, I think.
