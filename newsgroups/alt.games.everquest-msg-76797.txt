Hrm... along the running away like a little school-girl lines... (not that
there's anything wrong with either running, or school-girls), you can also
JUMP as you run....
Jumping and running really gives you a boost of speed..

Another trick is to add a skill to your hotkey (I Use sense heading) and
repeatedly click it... I've noticed I can gain just a fraction of an instant
every time I click it and it makes me run just a tad faster as well... CLICK
CLICKCLICK! Jump... run.. click click.. etc.,
