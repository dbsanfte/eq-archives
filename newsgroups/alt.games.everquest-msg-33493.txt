The way I see it, a group moving in to another group's camp area and telling
them to share or leave aren't interested in sharing at all. They're hoping
that the first group will get tired of only getting half the pulls, fighting
over spawns, etc. and just leave, so the second group will get the campsite
all to theirselves. I don't see it as "sharing", I see it as forcing a group
out of the spot so you can have it all to yourselves. It's using the PnP
policy to fuck over other players who probably won't do it back.

Actions like that hit very badly on your rep. If that happened in say,
Sebilis .. You can bet you'll have a difficult time grouping there ever
again.
