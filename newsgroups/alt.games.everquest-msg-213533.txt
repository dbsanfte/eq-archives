I can't say whether it is accurate nor how much time they actually put
in to assessing ZEMs.  However I will say that determining any zone's
relative ZEM should be technically easy (just time-consuming).  Just
start killing mobs of the same levels in different zones with the same
level character and counting up the experience you get for a kill.

One big difference between HHK and Overthere is that all the mobs in
HHK are within about 25 feet of the group and they are all about the
same level.  You are *constantly* killing things.  Chain pulling in
the Overthere is a little tougher since you have to run much further
between pulls (chain pulling is an art, not a science) and perhaps
also because you don't always run in to the mob level that you desire
on the pull.
