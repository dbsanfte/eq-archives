You do not remember correctly.  For ALL tradeskills, the stat checked is INT
or WIS, or alternate stat, whichever is highest.  In the case of smithing,
the alternate stat is STR, in the case of Fletching and Tailoring, the
alternate stat is DEX.  The other tradeskills do not have an alternate stat.
Regardless, the success rate on a combine has nothing to do with any of you
character stats, only with your current skill level, including skill
modifiers (geerlocks and such).  The stat is important for gaining skillups.
Sony has most recently confirmed this at the last fan faire, and it appears
to hold up based on tradeskillers experiences.  So, once again, in answer to
the original question, your INT does not matter at all for purposes of
succeeding in a combine.  Given that the combine is trivial already, you
will not get a skillup on it, regardless of what your stats are.  I hope
this clears up the confusion here.
