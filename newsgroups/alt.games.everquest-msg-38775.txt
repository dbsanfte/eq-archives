Measuring is pretty easy. You go to the karana's and position yourself in a
straight line along an axis, get a stopwatch, hit /loc, press the stopwatch
at the same time as the numlock (or whatever you have as autorun) and press
/loc at the same time you press your stopwatch. do the math as described
above.

Haven't tested anything myself yet, but I've also noticed the encumbrance
issue. I got a few shaman buffs, my agi was still higher then basic but I
was almost crawling with 1.5 times encumbrance. The str buff gave me a lot
more effect for it's price :)
