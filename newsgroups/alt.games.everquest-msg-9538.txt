I think you are going about this from the wrong direction and will
likely run into some legal issues with your anti-EULA law.  Rather than
pass a law that protects folks who want to act like assholes, which
would be very hard to do without a sacrifice of rights by business
owners, why not do what you can to support the creation of games that
cater to assholes.  EverPutz or Ultimate Assholes might be a nice name
for it, my treat, no charge for using one of them if you go into
production.  Then you could design a world that provides maximum outlet
for childishness without all the rigid rules of other games that get in
the way of good clean fun like swearing and threatening people.  I for
one would support you, not by buying your game of course, but I
encourage anyone who can to draw the assholes from the games I play and
into games I don't play, so I'm behind this effort all the way.
