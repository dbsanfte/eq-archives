Should be able to find some guards in Misty that are not red or green, i
think they have some of the largest ranges on guards i have noticed,
when tracking with my druid in Misty.

>High Hold Pass citizens 

You might want to leave these guys alone, in that you can't pass
directly through rivervale easily/safely to get to EK via the
RV-->MT-->Runnyeye-->Gorge route, so keep your high hold pass factions
up, you are a little high for some of the orcs and all, but kill orcs
and get so you can turn in scalps and ears to the guards there.


> Halas residents

Green young, or stay red forever.  You won't find anyone in your level
range here.


 Butcherblock dwarves... any notes on those targets?

You are still too low for dwarves in Butcherblock, but you could move to
Sister Island (Many will be green by now, but you should be able to take
a few of the static spawn sisters, then move to the dwarves on the other
side of the island around 24 or so, and fight them til 29.  

Akanon is supposed to have some decent spawns in the 20's, but have
never fought there.
You can raise Freeport faction while raising High Pass faction.  I think
it might also raise Corrupt Qeynos guards.

Sisters of Erollisi was kind of fun.  and about 95% of them drop a
purity belt, which will sell for a plat or so, not the greatest loot but
at the level to start hunting there it is good.  In about 3 hours
camping there i got a level and a half of experience and 70 plat or so. 
It will totally trash your G'fay factions however, it lowers Emerald
Warriors, Clerics of Tunare and something else it seems.  At 20, you
might be able to take on some of the rangers in lesser Faydark, not sure
of their levels, seems like they were blue white and above around 24 to
my druid when i was hunting for my braided ivy cords.
