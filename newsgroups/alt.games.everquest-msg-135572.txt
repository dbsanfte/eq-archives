    I still wish that gemcutter + JC item (in a jeweller's bag) yielded the
gemcutter and the original gem the item was made from, failure yields
gemcutter alone, trivial at the same trivial as the JC item combine. That
would prop up the value of old JC items where the gem is worth more than
vendor value.
