No, it was available for download up to the day that I decided to buy
it, at which point the download link was gone, and that was after
release, for the full version, costing $50 (which is less than the $65
it costs in stores here).  It was just below the links to retailers on
the page you get to when you click on the "But CoH" button.

My guess is they vastly underestimated demand and didn't have the
bandwidth to let everyone download who wanted to.
