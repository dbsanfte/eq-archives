You have that right.  It's still worth it.  Consider how often you fight
indoors and sow/selos runs out, or how many times in groups you don't have
selos/sow when things go bad.  With run3 you don't have to worry about mobs
beating on you while you try to get selos going.  It's also nice to be able
to chant kite without using selos.  Put 3 points into run and you will
always have a good jump on most mobs.
