Some of those games have a limitation where you can only cast so many
spells in a given day and have to rememorize them every night, and you
become able to memorize more spells as you progress. (I play a little
Baldur's Gate from time to time)

What EQ has is a mana pool which increases as you grow, more spells to
choose between as you grow, and the ability to memorize spells FASTER
as you grow. So what if I can only cast 8 different ones at a given
time? I've learned how to sit my butt on the ground and swap spells as
needed.
