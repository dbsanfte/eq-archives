I had my character going great on the FV server test, had just hit
level 9, got my bloodforge hammer, and was all set to start harvesting
wisps for easy cash.   Then disaster struck, Verant, in their infinite
wisdom, decided to buff every character on the server to 24.  

Now I have a level 24 druid with patchwork armor and level 5 spells, 1
or 2 level 9 spells, and no cash to buy any GOOD spells like wolf form
or ring spells or DoTs, etc.

This server has trivial loot code EVERYWHERE, so now I cannot get
gls's or ANY s's from wisps, can't harvest any kind of lower level
magic items to sell for cash.

So what are my options?  Does anyone have any good ideas for mobs to
kill that drop decent vendor-sellable loot?  

All I could think of is possibly dry bones and carrions in Unrest for
fine steel, but I imagine EVERYBODY is heading for Unrest, since
everybody is level 24 now with no gear =)
