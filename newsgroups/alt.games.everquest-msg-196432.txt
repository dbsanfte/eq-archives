The thing is, that for many songs (dots, regens) it doesn't matter
if they drop briefly, so long as they are back up before the tick,
and they are 3 tick songs.

On the EQ-Bard mailing list we used to do timelines to demonstrate this

5 songs, for argument's sake hymn, cantata, 3 chants.
Social for each - 
/pause 3, /stopsong
/pause 30, /cast #

Also assume your response/lag is good so you hit
the key for the next song as soon as the previous starts

Time 00:0 : Tick - press 1
Time 00.3 : Song 1 begin cast
Time 03.3 : song 1 starts (1 has 3 ticks left - 1:3 for notation)
Time 03.6 : song 2 begin cast
Time 06.0 : Tick (1:2)
Time 06.6 : song 2 starts (1:2,2:3)
Time 06.9 : song 3 begin cast
Time 09.9 : song 3 starts (1:2,2:3,3:3)
Time 10.2 : song 4 begin cast
Time 12.0 : Tick (1:1,2:2,3:2)
Time 13.2 : song 4 starts (1:1,2:2,3:2,4:3)
Time 13.5 : song 5 begin cast
Time 16.5 : song 5 starts (1:1,2:2,3:2,4:3,5:3)
Time 16.8 : song 1 begin cast
Time 18.0 : Tick (1 ends, 2:1,3:1,4:2,5:2)
Time 19.8 : song 1 starts (1:3,2:1,3:1,4:2,5:2)
Time 20.1 : song 2 begin cast
Time 23.1 : song 2 starts (1:3,2:3,3:1,4:2,5:2)
Time 23.4 : song 3 begin cast
Time 24.0 : Tick (1:2,2:2,3 ends,4:1,5:1)
Time 26.4 : song 3 starts (1:2,2:2,3:3,4:1,5:1)
Time 26.7 : song 4 begin cast
Time 29.7 : song 4 starts (1:2,2:2,3:3,4:3,5:1)
Time 30.0 : Tick (1:1,2:1,3:2,4:2,5 ends) - song 5 begin cast
Time 33.0 : song 5 starts (1:1,2:1,3:2,4:2,5:3)
Time 33.3 : song 1 begin cast

It will never tick with a song down - 
so even though you lose the icon for
hymn/cantata briefly each time through
it's not important.

Obviously this is perfect conditions - 
no missed notes and low lag.

Of course this is all moot for songs
with continous effects, like resists and
haste.
