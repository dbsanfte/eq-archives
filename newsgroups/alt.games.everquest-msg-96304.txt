Halas, the home of pelts, is also bereft of a hilt mold - indeed, so
are Qeynos and Surefall to the best of my knowledge. This caught me
out last night - I had 18 HQ catpelts, and only 6 MQ ones. I couldn't
find a hilt mold anywhere, so no skinnning knife and thus no studded
leather armour for the humans and half-elves in the area.

Looking up EQ Traders, there's a vendor in W Karanas, at -1400,
-12800.

Moving off topic slightly, my tailoring skill is now in the high
40s/early 50s, what should I look at next? My current plan is studded
leather->56, potion bags (I'm a shaman)->68, but then what best fills
the gap until the 80s, when I guess I'll stand a chance of making
backpacks.

Profitability is important to me, but I'm prepared to spend cash now,
just to get to the 80s and make backpacks. Any advice welcome
