Hi,

Thinking about doing this quest, my enchanter is a darkelf lvl 8 and i
don't mind to travel, question is, is it to early should i wait to
level 12 or further? or is it possible to do it at lvl 8, looking at
the quest page on graffe.com it says lvl 8+

Thanks for any thoughts on this

/Regards Berth
