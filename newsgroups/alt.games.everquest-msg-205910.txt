Nope. The closest you can get is to put the weapon slots in the
hotbutton window (click and drag from the inventory window)
and leave a bag of weapons open in the GUI so you can change
weapons without having to open the inventory mid fight. Also
I believe some custom UI's have setups like this hardwired in to
make it easier.
