How hot are you ?

No its not a come on, I mean have you checked your PC's Airflow and running
temp of your system ?

A while back I had an overheating problem which lead to EQ crashing as often
and once every 15 minutes making it almost impossible to play.
An extra cooling fan, and some dusting later and the games running fine
again.

Worth a try.
