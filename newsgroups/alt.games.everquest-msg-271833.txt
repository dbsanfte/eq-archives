Yes I know what a faq is, as I've been on Bitnet from 1988-1994 and
Usenet since 1992.

But it wouldn't be much text to explain some of the early things.
Explaing how to do the things needed to group sholdn't be too much
text as I'm not asking for a walk through.  And I figured out what
sow and temperance was, by seeing it explained in the game. But the
phrases/acronyms 'temp and 'sow' impart no information to a new
player. I didn't really use pok at first. And when I did, it was
just a transport method, I didn't make an attempt to find out much
of what was being talked about, I figured it would be mentioned
later on. Or someone would explain it to me if I asked.
