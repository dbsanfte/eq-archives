No,I dont,may surprise you, but lately had much fun in EQ1.
I am only complaining ,that they dont fix old issues before they throw
out another expansion.
What about some arguments instead of "Wah wah wah",lets say about
DX9 graphics,tell me why I should like to walk through a fog so bad

You dont think that needs fixing?
