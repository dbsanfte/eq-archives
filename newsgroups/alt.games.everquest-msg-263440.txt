I had been hoping that enough posters would see the almost inevitable
decline to armageddon in the upcoming EQ2 vs WoW threads to avoid the
hater/stalker dynamic. Alas, its already starting, and heck its not
even due to differences in those games and the threads dedicated to
them, but past differences from old disagreements just spilling into
them!

There's no way to deal in a mature fashion directly with the hater
mentality shown by Reg LeCrisp, Nostromo, and probably other more
occasional idiots in the future. They will continue their infantile
vendettas against both people and games no matter how many people they
alienate in the process, either too obtuse or too uncaring to realize
each and every post makes them less and less relevent.

I never thought Dick was a sock of Reg; he posted to a.g.e before
delving into the crossposted threads. (Bip would probably be less
inclined to leap to his defense if he saw those posts as well (I must
admit I didn't notice that only some of the threads were crossposted,
my first impression was that Bip had read them all), but Bob saw them
and hence the harder reply.) That said, here's hoping he doesn't turn
into another Reg/Nostromo and calms down his rhetoric a bit.
