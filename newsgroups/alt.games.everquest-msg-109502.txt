As if that market wasn't screwy enough.

Try to buy HQ bear skins for 25 plat, and I get lectured about how
they're worth much more than that. Duh, kids, I wrote a freaking
tailoring guide, I think I know what skins are worth. Certainly I know
what *I'm* willing to pay for them. And the last time I visited
Luclin, I was able to get plenty of cheap HQ rockhopper skins, which
serve the exact same purpose.

But then try to sell a tailored backpack for 100 plat, and the
pinheads (Are they the same pinheads? I don't know, Mr. Hand) try to
tell you it's not worth more than 50. Yeah, right. Can't have it both
ways.

I *hate* when I auction to buy or sell something and some moron
decides to argue with me in /ooc about my prices. Tell you what,
arguing pinheads, *you* master tailoring so you can make backpacks,
then buy ingredients and sell product for whatever you damn well
please. Until then, shut your festering gob.


Hmmm. Definitely need more sleep.
