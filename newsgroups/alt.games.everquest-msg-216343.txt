Thats not actually true, back in the bad old days a failed pacify aggroed about
75% of the time (and the spell itself failed about 75% of the time, a nasty
combination), but since the pacify patch a while back it only aggros about 20%
of the time, less according to some if you have a very high charisma.  But at
any rate, its entirely possible, and always was, to cast pacify on a mob, then
pull its buddy and have the original mob come along because the pacify didn't
stick even though he didn't aggro on you.

Also, the pacify line isn't some kind of mez plus mind blur, what it does is
reduce the aggro and social range on the target.  The higher level versions
reduce that range further and further.  However, if you move right on top of the
mob, or if the social mob you pulled paths right over him, you can still end up
with aggro even though the pacify succeded.
