No... this is NOT asking for a debate on the merits, etc.

I'm looking for some information on the specifics of DKP systems that
are sucessfully in use around the various servers. I know I've seen
links to such information in the past, but damned if I can put my hands
on it now.

So help a befuddled wizard out and give me some pointers or even some
personal info. on working systems you know of.

Specifically:

How do you award/assign the points to raid attendees?
How do you set values (assuming you do) to various specific items?
How do you handle items that never dropped before?
How are the raiders allowed to "spend" their points? Fixed value? Bid?
Other?

That sort of thing. Thanks in advance as always.
