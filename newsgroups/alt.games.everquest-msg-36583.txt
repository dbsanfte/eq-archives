    The spectators have to be in the arena. That means they can be
targetted. At the end of our first team BotB on our server, the winning team
(which was something like four level 60 WIZs) cut loose on the "stands" and
wiped out half the observers.

    Charm. The NPCs in the Arena are there precisely because they can be
charmed, and used against the other ENCH. If PCs were available to be used,
then some key elements of the setup could be avoided. For example, PCs may
have abilities (nukes, Backstab) that the selected NPCs don't have. The ENCH
also won't have to deal with aggro from a PC when his charm breaks - which
they WOULD with an NPC. That'll be a big part of the strategy - the ENCHs
can dispel each other's charm attempts, and will have to deal with the
resulting aggro.

    Personally, I think the smart ENCH will go for the unexpected strategy -
turn off spell effects, cast Sentinel right away, then kill the massively
lagged opponent. ;-)
