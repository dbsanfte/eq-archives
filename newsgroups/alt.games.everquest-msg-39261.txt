Theres SneakyAmp, with its horrid webpage at
http://www.execpc.com/~zor/SneakyAmp . And no it cant steal your password,
ask me for the source if that concerns you. :) As far as EQ giving you the
option to play your own music, you kinda can with the /mcicontrol thing, but
it doesnt work so great. When they added that command, I asked them about
using a SneakyAmp-like interface to control EQ, because that seemed like
where they were heading. Well, Absor gave me the lead-programmer's email,
and had me talk to him about it. He said it would be something that they'd
look into, and he'd look at my source. I havent heard anything about it
since though. I'm betting its very low priority, especially with Luclin on
the way. But they have seen the source, and I havent heard any objections
from them, so I guess you could say Sony approves. :)
