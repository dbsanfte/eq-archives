All things being equal, I'd go with the bard; he's got lull almost as 
good as a cleric's, but it costs him no mana to cast, and more important 
doesn't cost the cleric any med time to have him cast it.  He's also got 
CC for disasters; lull resist+aggro -does- happen.  And if he dies from 
an overpull... well he's not the one with the rez spell.

All things aren't always equal though, I'd go with an experienced 
cleric/warrior pulling team over an inexperienced bard puller any day.

Come to think of it, I do go with that team almost every day, its the 
core of my regular nightly group.  Speaking of which, time to log on and 
see if they are up, the holidays are playing havoc with our schedules.

Splendid
