Except I'm not. It's fact. You cannot in any stretch of the imagination 
make looting fair across the board for everyone in the game. The next 
best option (again, guild raiding and gear policies aside) is total 
random.

I'm not suggesting anyone be made to play either way. I'm merely debating 
the pros and cons of both. I've played both way and like many aspects of 
each. I won't ignore the fact that every getting equal opportunity is the 
most fair though. Most efficient? Maybe not, but then again, you can't 
optimize loot efficiency and effectiveness among unfamiliar players.
