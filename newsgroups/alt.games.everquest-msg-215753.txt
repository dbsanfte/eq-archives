> avg level 33-37 gets level 35  6pts -- mobs xx-xx,

I went on an adventure earlier with my 36 BST, the others in the group being
38 and 41 Mages, a 35 Shaman, 39 Paladin and a 43 Necro.

Mobs were DB to yellow, and hit in the low 90s - the max I saw (and have
logged) was a double for 95.

Looking at the info it was probably the L40 dungeon. We failed the rescue
mission (mainly due to a humungous train and wipe), so I couldn't see how
many adventure points we would have received. Exp was close to half a level.

That was the second adventure - the first was me (36 BST still), the 39
Paladin, 35 Shaman, 37 Mage and a 35 Monk. Mobs were all DB, with a max hit
of 89 (same as the lower mobs in the L40 dungeon). That adventure gave 3
points on completion, but as there were 5 of us, average level of 36, I'd
suspect that was the level 35 dungeon. Exp from this dungeon was around 1
and three quarter yellows.
