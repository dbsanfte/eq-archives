I've been reading this in my spare time and I have not finished
reading as of yet...:
http://savage.ranjoco.com/history.htm

A question I have about a few details ( I know there is a disclaimer
that much may not be correct ).  The Elven warrior Edril died and was
sent out in a casket on the Elizerain Lake.?!?!  I cannot find this
lake on any map that I can tell... many locations have changed names
since the time of this warrior, but the only lake I can find on
Faydwer is Dagnors Cauldron....  could this be the same lake?

any pointers in a direction would be sweet.

if you have any other links that have historical data on Norath please
post them here.

Good hunting to you.
