I've been part of raids that attempted to use this trick a couple times, and
its never gone too well. In the middle of the zone is a big building with a
goo in the middle of it. If you go to the south of the building and look up,
you'll see a semi-transparent ramp. Mobs sometimes travel up and down the
ramp, but you can nuke them and they'll come down to ground level without
training (usually). You have even nuke some mobs out of the overhead
building. Once it's relatively clear, you can Gflux some people  up to where
the ramp turns around, and if they sit there they're usually pretty safe. It
takes some work to get people up there, lots of trial and error. You never
really have to get a mage up there, but it speeds things along. Its not
advisable to send the mage up solo either, they'll have to jump down if
something drops by to bite them. But once the mage is up, they can start
CoTHing, and Gfluxing can continue as well. Once everyone is up, well, I've
never really made it that far, people always messed things up. :) But there
are still a bunch of mobs in the building up above, you cant clear them all
from ground level.

Hope that helps a little. In my opinion its easier to find a rogue. :)
