Agreed ... the quoted minimum for Windows XP is this:
http://tinyurl.com/4wk2
Try running it on that system.

The point is that you can run EQ on a minimum spec system ... it will
just run very badly.  As you do turn off all the models put up with
long zoning times and cope with that.  Or you can get a modern system
which copes very well with the new engine.

My systems are:

P4 3Ghz
1 Gb DDR 3200
Radeon 9800 Pro

and

Barton 2600
1 GB DDR 3200
Radeon 9600XT

Both work extremely well atm given the few problems I outlined in my
earlier post.
