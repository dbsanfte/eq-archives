I wonder if this change to charm in OOW is intended to see how it all
works out. If so, the devs probably decided to go overboard on dps
reduction since it would be easier (i.e. more acceptable to players)
to increase charmed pet dps afterwards than to reduce it.

There may be a bunch of assumptions that we can't see built into the
OOW charm and if this gets tweaked to something players find
reasonable, they look at doing this across the board (which _should_
allow for fewer non-charmables and less resists and better durations
on charms).

Test may be fine, but nothing brings out the flaws and faults like
realtime.

Of course, they could be just screwing up.
