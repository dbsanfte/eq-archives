The Hole, Velks, Maiden's Eye, Natimbi, Chardok, and of course you
could break down and do Dulak or maybe Nadox.  All of these are
probably soloable by a low-to-high 50's Beasty.

Melee soloing sucks though.  I leveled my Ranger up soloing a lot and
it was dreadfully slow.  Since then I have gotten a Necro to 59 and
have been killing whites, yellows, and reds most of that time.
