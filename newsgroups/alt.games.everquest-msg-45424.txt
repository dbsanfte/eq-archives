Well, if that's already above minimum spec I'm safe :)

I'm wondering if a lot more RAM wil help decrease loadtimes and such even
more. Would whole zones be kept in memory if you had enough (think 1GB), so
you could zone back and forth very quick. Would help a lot when you need to
zone to escape a monster and zone back in again after a few minutes.

Oh well.
