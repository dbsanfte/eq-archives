I apologize Lance. I actually reread it all before I sent it, and I knew
that saying "spinoff" was a poor choice of words in my final emote, but my
connection to my news account today is slow.  I should probably take it as
an opportunity to learn to type slower and think more carefully about what
I say.

As for the topic under discussion, I'm not qualified to have it.  What I
knew comes from lurking the moderated newsgroup for B5 (did you folks know
that JMS himself still posts there regularly?), and I was not paying
attention to either B5 or DS9 when they came out.  As the more vehement
fans of B5 would have me believe, DS9 was in fact a ripoff of JMS's idea,
but I'm in no position to know how true that is.
