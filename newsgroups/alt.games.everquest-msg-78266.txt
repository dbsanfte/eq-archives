For quality time, it doesn't really matter what classes they pick.  A necro
and magician, a ranger and warrior (fear kite kodiaks in GD) even a
cleric/chanter could kill stuff together. (chanter slows, chanter pet tanks,
cleric heals pet, both nuke)

So to answer the question which classes work in a pair?  Any class at all.
Even in the 'best duo' class, depending on the zone any classes can work.
