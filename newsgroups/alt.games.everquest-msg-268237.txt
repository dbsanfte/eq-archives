If you don't pay for it, the rent doesn't accrue, you'll just have to pay 
it when you get back.  If you are gone for more than 1 week, you'll only 
owe for 1 payment.  If you aren't using your apartment you can go without 
paying it indefinately and all your stuff will still be there when you 
finally pay the rent again.
