Well, we aren't realy told if there was spoken thanks or not, are we? I 
rather assumed there was.  We also aren't told if he'd been in the field 
long enough to take down even -one- exp mob, much less whether he was the 
one looting, or whether he was destroying all his coin or leaving things 
unlooted as monks (among others) frequently do.

I also thought it was just his friend that was rezzed.  Perhaps I need to 
go attempt to scry more meaning out of the OP's post.
