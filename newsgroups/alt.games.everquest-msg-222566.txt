They seem to do pretty well at CC even without their mez too. Dark and
agro kite a couple of adds seems to work well. Not sure if I agree
with the mage lvl DPS in LDoN, at least once the mage can pet-canni
efficiently.  Doesn't really matter though, either one can easily care
a lvl 65 group through a standard adventure on their DPS alone. I
think someone calculated that you need a DPS of 167 over the span of a
90 minute adventure if you figure 60 mobs to kill.

About the only person I'll ever hear ask for a twitch (in LDoN) is a
puller if he doesn't have KEI. There it does become efficient since it
takes away any potential downtime but overall I'd agree. Necro mana is
way too useful to bother with twitching.
