Oh, I forgot to mention this, and thought I had better do so, in order
to continue our attempts to educate you...

This particular post of yours belongs in the splinter thread started
by Alfredo. which is where he broached the subject.  You also posted a
reply IN Alfredo's thread that should have been in THIS one. You
REALLY don't understand the workings of Usenet (or indeed, etymology,
dictionaries, spellcheckers, etc.), do you.  Tragic... funny, but
still tragic.
