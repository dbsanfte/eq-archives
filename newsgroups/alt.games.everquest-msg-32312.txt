I think there should be an auto destroy you can toggle for any
character. Even on my druid when grouping I'd have it auto destroy
copper, silver and gold and only keep the plat. I think many people
would do the same or possibly just copper and silver at lower levels.

ML really sucks, even at the very high levels. You'd be surprised at
how people will think up excuses and bail for a couple diamonds and
some plat by pulling the old "oh my friend who is a porter and me left
very fast and forgot why are you so greedy jeez anyway we have to go"
trick. It only works out well if a person you know is trustworthy is
the ML'r. I think rather than ML'ing you should roll on ever drop or
item of semi value AS YOU GET IT and other wise split the plat as you
get that also.
