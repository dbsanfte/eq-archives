I don't think I buy Healing over Gheal, the fraction of a second faster cast
doesn't beat the triple size heal.  The paragraph above, though is certainly
correct; hell with everything else that may be happening, pop your fast heal
on that chanter if there's a hint he may need it.  When you get Remedy you
can forget all about both GHeal and SHeal, thats the chanter saver.

Chain stunning mezed mobs is suicidal... only the first stun you get (well later

I think there's another) is damage free, the rest will break mez like any other
nuke.  Actual Stun, yes, root, sure, and my favorite, Atone, very functional...
heck, I've happily used Flash of Light as aggro control, talk about cheap and
effective!

I also thank you for joining me on the hobby horse that is my rant against the
heal and med cleric.

No, here I disagree... while all your points are correct, the fact is that none
of them have anything to do with the chanters AC.  This is because the
chanter's AC is quite beyond the point, other than a low level chanter with
twink gear and high level PL buffing, a chanter's AC isn't going to make
10 points of difference in the damage he takes from being beat on.  The
chanter lives entirely because the group acts correctly to defend him, not
because he got an extra 20AC from an AGI buff.

Hmm, you left out Nuke (assuming that thing that is grabbing the chanter
is a fairly soft target... but a cleric thing, particularly with undead targets)
and
Atone/Mem blur (Atone a cleric deal, one of the best), melee (not a
happy option, but clerics can take a whupping a lot longer than a chanter,
their AC actually -does- count for something!) and Fear (which can rapidly
lead to Evac time, but better that than res time... and another cleric
specialty)
Oh, and Res... which is what the cleric can do for you when every other option
failed.

Also, you should note that cleric roots and our lowest level stun are the
superior no-damage kind, which means we can slap them on mobs that
the chanter is mesing without breaking the mez if it comes thru.  SImilarly,
Druid/Ranger snare is better than Necro/SK snare, as -it- is no damage.

Yes, a cleric's job is to keep the chanter alive, the chanter's job is
to keep the cleric alive, when we can spare the time we will keep
the rest of you alive as best we can.... but when the fit hits the shan,
dead chanter is dead group, and dead cleric is likely to lead rapidly
to dead chanter.

> Chanters should die even less than clerics do.

Here I have to disagree, if you had to chose one member to survive
a total wipeout, it would be the cleric, not the chanter.  Chanter, like
everyone else, should die getting aggro off the /q cleric.   Second most
important surviver would be the monk/necro/SK... because they should
FD the instant the now LD cleric makes it out alive.

On average well protected chanters -do- die even less than clerics, but I
take issue with "should."  Perhaps you mean "can be expected to"
