Yes it is the same k = kilobytes per second.
Your connection on expressnetwork *should* run between 40-60 kb per 
second with bursts up to 180 kb per second.

Ensure that you are on expressnetwork, DO NOT log on with the mobile 
office kit using quick-2-net. Espressnetwork with the normal 79.99 
feature will not impact your minutes becuase the 79.99 gives unlimited 
usage on expressnetwork. Quick-2-net will only give you an average speed 
of 14.4 kb per second and WILL burn up your airtime.

An ISP is also required to use expressnetwork as verizon is not acting 
as an ISP, only a carrier for the sgnal [like the telephone line and 
telephone company are not internet service providers normally, though 
some phone companies do offer ISP services. Our ISP is obviously 
Earthlink, not Southern New England Telephone]

Now if you can get sent to the Baltimore/Washington beltway area, you 
could get wireless broadband=) and play EQ from a park bench=)

Any more questions? Anything you need clarified?
