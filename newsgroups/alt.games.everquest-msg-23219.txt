I think I can guess why the RP server won't be PvP.....

Several of the PK'ers on Sullon Zek that I've seen absolutely detest
Roleplayers (unless they roleplay serial killers and mass murderers...and
even then....)  The PvP Roleplayers want to roleplay a fantasy war setting.
On the other hand, many of the PK'ers don't care about strategy, tactics, or
the long term effects of their actions... they just want to slaughter their
neighbors, as if it were nothing more than Quake with spells and swords.

If you make the RP server PvP as well, you'd attract the Quakeheads who
would try to make life miserable for the Roleplayers by acting like jerks,
and claiming that the ONLY purpose for PvP is to PK everyone in sight.
