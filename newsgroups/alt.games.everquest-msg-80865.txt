As everyone who regularly reads this board knows, I am NOT a computer geek.
But I was thinking, earlier tonight, as I was driving home from my 10th time
of seeing LoTR, about getting the DVD when it comes out. And then I
wondered -- is there a way to get stills or "screenshots" when you're
playing the DVD on your computer? There are some wonderful pics I'd love to
have as rotating screensavers, but have no idea if this could be done or
not, and if I needed other equipment than my computer and the DVD. Anyone
know?

TIA!
Darklet
