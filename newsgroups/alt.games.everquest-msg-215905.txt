To Zerg a target is to rush it with large numbers, far in excess
of whats needed to kill it using normal tactics, or to rush it
with a smaller group, see lots of deaths, and rez the bodies to
keep replacing the dead.  Rez taking out all mana and buffs and
most of your HP, this is a sloppy and inefficient way to kill
things, but with sufficient numbers it can be used to wear away
almost any target.

You can even do this with much smaller groups; the classic
minimal example is for a level one character to pull a mob over
near his bind point, fight till he dies, then repop run over to
the mob and keep pounding.  As long as the mob is still at least
partially injured by the time he gets back to it, eventually he
will win, and at level one there will be no exp loss to worry
about.
