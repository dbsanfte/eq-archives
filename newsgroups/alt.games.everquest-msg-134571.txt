    True.  We should be taking odds on things like after the patch will:

Bard Songs be broken
Boats be (still) broken
Pets be more inclined to try to brave their way unaided through Norrath
Moss snakes start dropping Blue Diamonds
People be able to zone into Jaggedpine Forest but not zone out
High Elf clerics suddenly be KOS to Freeport Paladins regardless of
previous faction
Loud bird chirping sounds start in Ramdom_zone_01

Annie <--- Sure others can think of better ones

My main on Firiona Vie:

By the side of Lenny, the Traveling Ogre Warrior.
Members of the Council of Mithril Dreams.
Teapray Oogrog  -- High Elf Cleric, 29, everyday is a new adventure!
