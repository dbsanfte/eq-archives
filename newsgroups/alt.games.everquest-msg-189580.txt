At your level I would suggest a run over to Nurga, this place is stupidly
fast exp and you can invis all the way throught the zone.

Keep all the green goblin skins and Mt death salts you find and sell them in
the bazaar.

On AB Green goblin skin go for around 30-40pp each, and salts ... well I've
never seen the salts for sale but I sell them for 15 - 20pp each (as you
need 2 per turn in for the faction quest they are used in), I sold out
within 30 minutes and made over 2k plus some easy exp.

Otherwise try either leather padding or heady Kiolas and have a good laugh
at how much the mad traderskillers with pay for items that triv out so low
(heck you can even buy all the items needed for the Heady Kiolas at around
2.5pp a stack)

I've already posted the guide for how I would go about making leather
padding umpteen times I'm sure if you scroll back far enough you will find
some level 65 druid complaining that its not worth spending a few hours
getting your tailoring up for only 400pp a stack when he can phram up 6
billion k in 6.5 seconds.

and Heady kiola recipes are here
