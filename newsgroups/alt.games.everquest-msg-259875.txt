Tribute haste acts as worn haste, so it would stack with spell haste and
bard overhaste like any worn haste item.

http://lucy.allakhazam.com/ also lists the tribute value for every item in
game.  If you are a Allakhazam subscriber, you can search items by tribute

Primordial Driftwood Compound Bow, has the highest tribute value.
