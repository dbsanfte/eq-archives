One of the Crays I was console operator on, had 8 CPUs. Programs
could be written to do graphics calculations in parallel. Cray
UNICOS, a super set of Unix, had much larger hard drives, lots of
ram, and they were fast. The one I worked with had a Sparc
workstation as a front end, just to handle all of the program
queues. It had a special man-made liquid circulating around the
cards, to prevent them from overheating. A PC just cannot compare in
speed.
