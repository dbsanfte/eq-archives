Your past is not forgotten Ben.  You are the one who made the choice and
will always be remembered for choosing to support your indefensible
points with personal attacks.  This is especially humorous considering
your comments regarding such attacks.  Each time you see me quoting the
old SNL line it is a tribute to that choice you made.

We can discuss things I've said but this portion of this thread is in
regards to a statement you made.  If you want to talk about another
subject, say perhaps something I've said, have at it, but please don't
change the subject here.  What I said here was that you were wrong, 
nothing about the things you claim I have said.

You didn't say anything about using correctly or incorrectly and neither
did I.  You really must stop inserting extraneous arguments into  the
discussion.  Again, somewhat humorous in light of your comments about
straw men.  You made a statement as to what the channel was "exactly
meant for".  Remember that, it comes up later.

So even you admit that it was not "exactly meant for" penis waving, but
in fact was meant for general  OOC conversation.  For a guy admitting he
was wrong you misspelled "I'm" as "You are".

Oh very good, throw in a few catch phrases and maybe the fact that you
were wrong can be obscured.  "exactly meant for" implies exclusivity. 
Still you made a good attempt at misdirection.  The "meant" part is
especially nice as it opens the door for you to now claim that by using
the words you did that you didn't mean what they mean and that in fact
your hidden meaning is the one you defend, not the meaning of the words
you actually posted.  Good show.

Yes yes, attacking me personally is the best way to show the value of ad
hominem attacks.  You are good at this!  Of course you've had practice.

Well you tried anyway.
