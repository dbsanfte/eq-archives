It depends whether you are playing on a PvP server or not.  While you
are playing on a non-PvP server, it is just annoying when someone do
that, because it is rude.  On a PvP server, usually it is follow by
someone trying to Pk you.  This is one way for the PK'er to guess your
AC and attack dmg before they attack.  I play on a PvP-team server,
and if someone from another team inspect me, I run away.
