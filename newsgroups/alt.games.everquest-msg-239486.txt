Eve has advanced pretty much in the last couple of months imo. There
is a good deal of pvp going on now since the introduction of
conquerable space stations. For the industry oriented players the
release of the new tier of technology has brought in a new level of
gameplay. In may we are expecting the "Shiva" release to introduce
more Player Owned Structures and such features.

There is a focus towards the players organizing themselves at the
moment and that is good from my point of view but some players do not
want to play in organizations and thereby feel left out.

No player in EVE is flying a Titan.
