I wanted to check the naked stats on my male Iksar monk.  Before I could
find a quiet corner in PoK to strip down in, some friendly passerby buffed
me, so I decided to run off and hunt for a while.  When the buffs wore off
I was in Great Divide, and I decided rather than head back to PoK I'd go
to the dwarf city of Thurgadin to sell loot and do some "vendor diving".

When I finished my business there, I returned to my original plan of
checking my stats.  It felt wrong somehow to just strip naked in the
middle of the street, so I went into a nearby inn and went upstairs
where I knew from other trips there were some empty rooms.  I headed
into one of them, preparing to strip, when I noticed there was another
player in the room already.  It was a female Iksar!  I mumbled an
apology and hastily found another room.  It felt VERY weird!
