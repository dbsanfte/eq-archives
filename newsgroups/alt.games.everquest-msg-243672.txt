True. De-leveling to 11 by jumping repeatedly off the top of Highpass 
Hold would give me something to do as well. Or counting every Decaying 
Skeleton in East Commons. Or hailing every NPC in the game. Or leaving a 
five-pointed star made of corpses at every zoneline.

I wasn't talking about just *something* to do, I was specifically 
talking about something *enjoyable* to do. I'm sorry I didn't make 
myself clear.
