Screw 'em.  No, I'm serious, tell them to kiss off and take their
plutocratic rotation with them.  No player has any right to deny someone
access to any mob.  If they want to set up a rotation to make things work
more smoothly, that's fine, but they have NO right to deny access.  If
you've got a force that's capable of doing it, then go for it.  What
business is it of their's if you take along smaller guilds?

If you're going to play by the rotation, then put yourself on, and take
whoever you want, and if they have any issues, tell 'em to stuff it.
Personally, I'd advocate getting what you can until either the rotation
burns, or it gets fixed in a way that isn't so blatently self-serving to the
big guilds.  If it puts you on the shit list, oh well.  What good is their
"favor" doing you anyways?
