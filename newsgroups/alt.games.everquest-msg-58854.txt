Not so if you used the old trick of keeping the stocks monitor running
or a chat room. That was a well known way around the inactivity
detector you mention.

Yes I'm sure. It's been *confirmed* to me by *AOL tech support* and if
you read some of the other postings here and in the gaming newsgroups
you'll see it's not just me!. I wouldn't be getting cut-off every 45
minutes bang on the nose if it wasn't AOL now would I ?. Considering
that I told you that like you I've been subscribing for a long time
and it only happened after a patched to my AOL client a few days ago,
. get the picture ?. I've been playing EQ through AOL flat rate since
it started, and now DAoC since that went public so I think I know what
I'm talking about ;).

Also, as someone has already pointed out, it seems to be rolling out
by area or 'phone provider, so it depends on which access number you
use for AOL. It seems us non-BT line folks got it in the neck first. I
can assure you though, it *is* true. Now whether or not this is AOL
just using certain users to test the reaction I don't know, but it is
certainly a reality for many of us even if it may not have reached you
yet. Let's hope it doesn't and they withdraw it like they were forced
to do in France. See the thread from the French guy who posted about
AOL's attempt to do similar over there.

B.B.
