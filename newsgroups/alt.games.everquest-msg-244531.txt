You did? Must have missed it. The answer is yes, they can regulate
their servers the way they see fit. Its when we delve into Dark Tyger
land and try to claim we can clap them in chains, declare them illegal
with any myriad of copyright infringement charges that I have issues.

>Or whether they can legally nerf content for any reason at all.

Once again, yes. And you can legally nerf(delete) your account for any
reason at all. Feel free to do so if you don't like the changes, but
don't try to claim they can't.

I can claim I 'own' it sure. That lasts so long as they don't decide
to revoke the privilege.. but its the same way with any country on
this planet. You only own your house so long as the government in
power doesn't decide they want it. You have more legal recourse in a
lot of cases offline.. but if they want it, they'll get it.

SoE only has one recourse... figure out who the accounts are and
suspend their access. The people involved simply aren't doing anything
that is against the law and i'm sure their lawyers have told them
that.

They not only get reamed by court expenses.. but they add to the cost
by not getting income from the accounts which they banned. At the same
time, assume they really went after and banned core accounts left and
right and got a lot of the problem banned. What then? I personally
believe that a lot of established RPG's will stagnate if new users
don't have the option to get a lot of the starter gear, and just
getting a game established is hell and a half in the current
enviornment, by cutting off the engine which generates new blood.. you
only end up hurting yourself with nothing on the backside except 'user
goodwill'.. and that juice aint worth the squeeze.
