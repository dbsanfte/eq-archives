We need flags or levels; 55 for POV/POS, and higher I think for the 
rest.  Since I'm guildless, the odds of me getting any flags so I can 
get in sooner aren't too good, unless a Mark of Execution is droppable 
on FV and I happen accross someone friendly who has one.

 From former characters, I can say that even the yard trash in POV/POS 
was markedly better exp than anything in tier one, but that was for a 
61+ character (the only one I had that got those flags, I was playing 
there before they added the level workaround).  I'm not certain a low 
level group will find it as appealing, the idea was that high mob level 
combined with fast kills kept the exp rolling in, the ZEM is exactly the 
same as in other zones.

Since I've observed, thus far, that mobs that are hard to kill may be 
decent exp per kill but not per hour (1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1=8, 2+2=6), its 
possible that at 55 POV won't be any better than POD or PON.

Of course I've also observed that having someone high level in the group 
dramatically accelerates the kill rate (2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2=16) without 
taking a crippling share out (8*1/6 < 16*1/8) and perhaps it would be 
easier to hook up with a high level or two in the higher tier zones than 
in the trash zones of tier 1.

Whats amazing me is that this is the same model I'm familiar with of 
old; kill many easy mobs, not few hard ones.  I thought that they 
altered the balance some time back by increasing the exp you get from 
mobs close to your level; in fact this was part of the reason that there 
was "no exp outside POP" up to 60, and "no exp until you pass trials (to 
get to tier 2)" from 61 to 65: not only was there the ZEM to consider 
(after all, its the same ZEM in POV as in POD) but the mobs were higher 
level so you got that bonus.

At 52, am I just not high enough for the bonus?  I've been grouped 
killing a fair number of white and yellow mobs both in POI and PON 
recently and the exp is definately nothing to write home about.
