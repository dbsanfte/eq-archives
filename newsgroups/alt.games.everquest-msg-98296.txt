You are correct, I'm not a totle newbie. But, I usually don't read the
"server status" threads.I read the ones that I either can offer some help
in, OR ones that might give me some new info. I don't pay attention to every
nuance of the group, therefore I didn't know flaming was somethign donw to
those who post such questions. I'm sorry if I seriously pissed anyone off
