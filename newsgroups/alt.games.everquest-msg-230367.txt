Much of it was being moved over to the ezboard site.  And then
ownership of that site became an issue (more below).

AND there's a question about if the ezBoard forums were part of the
sale or not.  Oagre (beastlord.com former owner) originated the ezb

He is still listed as the owner at ezb, so...

It looks like (at this moment) this is where we'll end up.  I just
hope it doesn't get all splintered.  I know at a minimum there will be
2 forums as a lot of folks won't leave the original one that Yantis
now owns.
