In that instance, yes. I dont know the cost of the incomplete heal, but
the stone does 40hp for 20mana. For a cleric to break even with
CHeal, you'd need to do 800 damage. My cleric has about 4500 fully buffed.

150 I believe.

...and still has not addressed the double zone time, run time from nearest
