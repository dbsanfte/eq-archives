They can give any damn opinion they like. My target is the idea that
the changes are *bad*. If you are going to present the idea that the
changes are *bad* because "they make things too easy", you better be
prepared to defend your argument with something more substantial than
"well thats my opinion". So far nobody is.

Closed minded indeed.

Nice dodge. Question remains unanswered. If you want to show the
changes as bad because things will get too easy, show how they will
get too easy. You can "believe" they are too easy all you want but
don't try to use it as support of your argument without presenting any
facts.

Who cares? Does it being a hindrance somehow make it a good thing?

If Verant didn't have infravision and ultravision and made darkness
complete blackness would you consider it a *good* thing just because
it makes the game harder?

The idea that "harder" = "better" continues to be a fallacy until you
can show that the changes make the game *too* easy (not easier, too
easy). Still waiting....

What part of the spellbook being a DUMB idea that even Verant doesn't
want don't YOU understand?

The players don't want it. The company doesn't want it. But Jazz likes
that it makes things harder for no reason, so we better keep it.

Out of curiosity, what level and class is your character? Will this
change directly affect you at all? We play on the same server btw.

Interestingly I'm not the one with a closed mind here. I continue to
actually wait for someone to refute what I argued, and all I see is
dodges. The others are backing off their arguments to the point of
"potential future problems", but you appear to be digging in on this
patch making things too easy. So I still await your proof that things
will now be too easy and all the bad consequences of that....
