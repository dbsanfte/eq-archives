damn, his ass would be SO divorced!

I love my husband dearly, I would do pretty much anything for 
him, but if he started doing that he would be gone. I divorced 
one husband for a variant of that ... and still love him after 
more than 15 years... but there are some things I will *not* deal 
with.

[FWIW, he had issues *parting* with money, I had no access to the 
bank accounts, and we would have 3 or 4 K$US in the bank and they 
would be turning off our water and power for lack of payment. He 
gave me the excuse for not fixing the kitchen up by removing the 
80 or so year old many layers of linoleum by telling me that when 
he was working he was out of town and not able to do the work, 
and when he was home he wasnt working and we couldnt spare the 
money. So I took the money I could spare out of the household 
budget [about 500 $US over a 3 month contract] and bought the new 
floring materials, adhesives and assorted stuff it would take, 
then when he got home told him to get to work. HE did - removed 
the flooring and sanded the mildewy moildy floor without 
isolating the kitchen from the rest of the house, filling it with 
sawdust full of mold, mildew and odd chemicals. I have COPD and 
asthma. I left because he refused to clean the mess up, and I 
refused to clean it up because I didnt feel like stopping 
breathing and going to the morgue. Passive-aggressive behavior on 
his part in the Worse way.]
