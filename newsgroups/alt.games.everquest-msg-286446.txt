Logged in this morning, played around a bit running some quest errands, 
and saw a 40 minute warning, 6 hour patch coming up.

Got a few things done, most of what I'd planned to, so this wasn't an 
inconvenience really, I have to get some RL stuff done and wasn't going 
to be able to play all morning anyway.

But I did some RL errands, and then made breakfast, went to look at the 
web site to see what was up, and under game updates, this is what you see:

	The next Game Update is tentatively planned for Wednesday, July 25, 
2007.  Details will be made available as we get closer to the date.

Yep, an hour and 42 minutes after the patch has started, they're still 
not even sure about when they're going to start it.

Left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing, or just too lazy to 
update the message that tells their clients?
