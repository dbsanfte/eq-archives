They were talking about that frog all over the net. He was on our server 
(Xev) and was a twink of one of the members of our resident Uberguild, 
Harmonium. IIRC correctly, the expansion came out on a Thursday, and he 
was 65 with epic when I showed up for work Monday morning. As soon as he 
was PL'd to 46 he was flagged and locked in CoD with his necro owner for 
a day or so straight. It was pretty obvious it was a couple people 
sharing the account, but they still did it in an amazingly short period 
of time.
