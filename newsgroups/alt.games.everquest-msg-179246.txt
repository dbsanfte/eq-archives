Hi, I'm a level 64 enchanter.

The effect of CHA on mezzes is still unresolved.  There was one trial that
showed a small effect, but I personally think that was just variation due to
the RNG, and if they repeated it a few more times the effect would go away.

People still post lots of anecdotal evidence that says "my mezzes seem
to stick better when I have high CHA", but they also say they've never done
any comparisons to back it up.

In my experience, level has a MUCH bigger effect on mezzes.

The effect of CHA on charms is quite noticeable.  Charms land more often and
last longer.  But tashing the mob first has an even bigger effect on charms.

CHA also has an effect on the revised Lull line.  Previously, if something
resisted Lull, it would aggro and drag all of its friends along, which was
what the spell was designed to prevent.  Now, if something resists, there is
a check against your CHA.  If the check succeeds, the mob doesn't aggro.

Personally, CHA is something I try to keep as high as I can, but not at the
expense of INT or AC.
