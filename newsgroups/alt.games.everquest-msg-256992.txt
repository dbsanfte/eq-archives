I've been working on intimidation on and off since getting it at around 
6th level, because the potential for usefulness as a melee with snare 
seemed immediately obvious to me.

I've been right, too, it -is- useful in many situations, has saved my 
bacon a few times and more often has simply saved me some down time, as 
I take less damage during fights where I can use it.

Situations where I can use it aren't as common as they once were, 
though, as more and more I find myself in spots where I have to keep the 
mob pinned down in a fight spot, not let it saunter slowly away while I 
chop into its unprotected back.

Still, I keep at it when I can.

Oddly, although my skill has gone from the 20s to around 150, it doesn't 
seem to work any more or less often than it once did; once or twice per 
fight on average.

Having read hints and used my own observations, I see that kick is used 
as part of the intimidate action, and that the kick must land before a 
resist check is made, can't tell for sure whether this uses the kick 
skill, but I've raised that up to my cap (149 apparantly, although the 
web site I saw said 200) just in case.

Latest hint I saw, in some unrelated thread, was that charisma is 
important for intimidate!  Well, my cha is around 65 most of the time, I 
have a pair of opal encrusted steins I put in for shopping/selling, 
which raises my cha as high as will ever matter assuming I'm not using a 
hostile merchant... but I can't swap those in while intimidating mid fight.

I could try investing in some cha gear to wear, or on a more practical 
approach, just arrange for a cha buff, in fact I probably will do the 
latter soon just to test out the theory for myself, but I'm wondering if 
anyone has any input other than this vague hint on this issue.
