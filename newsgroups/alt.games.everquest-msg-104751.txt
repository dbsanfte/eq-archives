There are 2 named Commanders (Commander Zezush and Commander Zerizuh or
something), one on the first floor, one on the second floor, who spawn
randomly in assorted places on the first two floors. They drop an Idol
(First floor) and a Ring (second floor) every time and VERY rarely also
drop a key to the third floor to the Arch Lich area (first floor
Commander) or the Creator area (second floor Commander). The Idol and
Ring, together with an Insignia from the 3rd floor named (General etc)
combine in the pouch from the basement to make an equipable ring (nice
stats) which is also the key to the Emporer area.

Of course, the Emp is immune to melee, so you'll also need to equip your
whole guild with self-made Shissar Bane weapons, but that's another
story..
