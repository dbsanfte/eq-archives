Well Ive hit the point where I am wondering what to do next with my little
warrior. Im currently in a guild that is starting to hit the outer edges of
PoP raiding. The guild itsself is most decidedly a family type guild that
likes to hit the ocasional ( or as has been the case lately, more than
ocasional ) raid target. As it is Im probably the #3 or so tank in the
guild. Fully Raid buffed ( 9 and Kazaad ) Im sitting right around 8100 hp.
Here is her curernt gear.

I dont think that the AA's are current. Currently she has 102 AA's, with the
most important ones being AE Taunt, ID 4 ( Working on getting that to ID5 ),
LR5, PE, PD3 and PP5. Theres some others in there that Im sure Im missing,
but those seem to be the ones that Ive gotten the most mileage out of.

Given that Info, what raid targets can I suggest that my guild hit, that I
can tank for us ? For planar targets, Ive tanked Bot Mini's, easily, and
Tanked Sleepwalker easily. ( For you uber out there, I KNOW thats not
impressive, I just mention them as a guage of my ability as a tank ) Ive
also done a lot of tanking in HoT, and NToV.

The gear progression that I see ahead of me at this point is the Tak BP ( 1k
points available so almost there ), and then possibly a couple of EF pieces,
specifically the helm. ( Will be SO nice to have a graphic free head
piece!! )

Any suggestions are greatly appreciated!
