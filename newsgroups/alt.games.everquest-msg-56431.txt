Dude, who pissed in your breakfast? This change takes *nothing* away, and 
makes a bunch of people happy. If you don't want to play a monster, just 
fucking don't, and be done with the bitching.

If it wasn't for the "wishlisters", we'd still be playing the first 
revision of EQ, and, in case you weren't around, it *sucked* compared to 
what EQ is like these days. Remember this the next time you buy a whole 
stack of food or drink from a vendor in one click.

I, for one, wouldn't mind at all a whole monster-oriented subgame, for when 
you get tired of the levelling treadmill.
