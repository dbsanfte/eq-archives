It wasn't as unusual as you think.  Kaev did not get an FBSS until
he could solo HGs reliably at L49 (when he got 25% self-haste buff).
I was in a few Frenzy groups in LGuk before that, just never got
lucky.  And I knew lots of other melees who got their first haste
in the 46-50 level range.  Yes, there were many twinks who had an
FBSS at L20 or earlier, but most non-twinks I knew had to wait
until L40+.

Was true of many twinks.  But folks who worked their way up without a
sugardaddy, like Martin/Meem did, had experiences more like his.
