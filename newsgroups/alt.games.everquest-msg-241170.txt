Hell yea, I sometimes wish I could temporarily mindwipe myself of all

Precisely why GMs don't tend to pull that kind of thing. :)

Problem is, it's the wrong test.  You're testing "Is toon (a) also being 
played by the player of toon (b)".  Bots are allowed.  When my guild 
raids, we're frequently as much as 1/4 botted.  What you -want- to test 
is, "are these bots being run by macro programs?"  Which would be not 
allowed.  

It's also much harder to test.  You have to distinguish between one guy 
running 72 toons via a macro proogram of some sort, and one guy playing 72 
toons who's an absolute demon with alt-tab.

}>Still.. if GM's go about doing this in such an

}>be concise, one reasonable question, and clearcut as to seperating the
}>'bots' from the 'humans'. Hard thing to do, easy to obfuscate.
}I presume the GM despawns the event. 

And we trigger the mass-whine-about-evil-GMs script...  24 bots file 
badly-worded petitions, 13 send tells with a variation of "WTF u 
suck" to the GM, 10 gate to bind and log in disgust.  5 toons randomly 
start rebuffing everyone for the next attempt, 12 run around on random 
paths issuing confusing emotes, one group of 6 starts hunting whatever 
yard trash might still be nearby.

}And then the inquisition begins
}in earnest. The lack of coherent internal (logged) chatter amonst your
}bots alone would be a pretty big tipoff. What are you going to do
}write an 'inane chatter engine' too... I bet even that wouldn't pass
}more than a cursory examination.

Well, you -could- write an inane chatter engine.  Just replay a log of 
/rsay from your last real raid. :)  But it would be much easier to claim a 
legitimate excuse for the lack of inane chatter, ie, our guild uses 
teamspeak/irc/aol instant messenger, and put it in all the character's 
/afk flags.  And then make sure you have two healers that keep calling 
cheals in /rsay anyway. :)  Most of raid chatter is easily predictable 
"Chealing %T in 10 sec" that could easily be simulated, or even used as 
part of the script.  Just throw in a couple dummy conversations about last 
night's sporting event and how cute the wood elf druidess is, and you're 
set.

}>>particularly hard... a lag spike...

This would be difficult, and would be, in my opinion, the most fun part of 
the whole project. :)  I do think you give too little credit to simple 
software being able to aapt, though.  Consider the story of Farglik:

http://archive.gamespy.com/fargo/august03/autorpg/

He's my hero.  :) Such a simple program, that dealt so nicely with a huge 
number of contingencies.  It does not seem to me that you would have to 
add much to that to play any class mediocre-ly in a raid environment.  
And I recently toured Xylobot's messageboard, and was really suprised how 
incredibly easy it would be to implement little Farglik.  Sure, you're 
probably not going to do Rathe Council that way, but you could probably 
farm NToV, or BoT towers.

}Sure in theory. Now do it. I dare ya... just do it. You pull that off
}and you'll have an AI engine you could sell to a hundred game
}publishers and be set for life.
}Game companies have striven for years to come up with human like
}AIs... so far the results have ranged from abysmal to miserable. If
}you think you can whip one together just like that then I'd invest in
}it myself. ;)

Naw, you're thinking you need a -good- AI.  You still have a couple human 
brains at the actual controls, they're just playing 72 toons between them.  
Mediocre AI would make up the difference here pretty well. :)
