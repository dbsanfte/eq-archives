I was afraid someone would mention Guk :) Unfortunately Guk i out of the
question for me due to the fact that its COMPLETELY dark team controlled on
Vallon Zek.  A dou of Lighties would get ruthlessly hunted down and PK'd by
the groups in there. Thats OK I can live with that as we do the same thing
to the Dark Team in Valks ;)

Thanks for the input though. Youve at least given me insights on where I
will need to work for my dungeon hunting :)
