 I'm mixed on the whole 'tweak VP' thing. Upgrading the loot will bring
back those guilds who have already finished with it, blocking out those
who were just getting to that point. Plus those guilds that were just
getting there get slapped back if the mobs are upgraded.

 Curious though, what's the correct way to do VP? The first few times
while learning the pulls I could see it taking 12 hours or so if you run
into bad luck (Hoshkar/Silverwing gate can ruin your day). After you've
done it a few times 6-8 hours should be easily doable. After that you
can come back and clear it just for fun. We've done VP under 2 hours a
few times now.

 The biggest problem I see with VP is the annoyingly fast respawns that
seem to serve no purpose since everyone just invisses past them now.
