Hi y'all, I am Slaani Headbanger 65th Season Shawoman on Stromm
server. When I logged on yesterday (9/10/04) I started receiving tells
from EVERYWHERE. "Why do you con yellow?" "WTG on 66!" etc etc etc. I
have no idea what happened, I can only assume its a bug and did submit
a bug report right away. I think maybe the GM messed up, I fell in POK
last Saturday taking 20,000 damage. It took them until Thursday to rez
me, then lost my corpse! LOL When I finally got my corpse I logged.
When I logged back in, I was no longer lvl 65 with 100% xp, I was lvl
66 with 43% xp. Go figure. I'm sure it will be fixed soon. Have a
great day :)
