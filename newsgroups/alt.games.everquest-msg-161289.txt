I have been wanting to play a Midgard warrior but everybody on the 
boards that Midgard warriors consistently are underpowered compared to 
Heroes and especially Armsmen.  Now, midgard is suppose to be the 
"toughest" faction so why is it that Armsmen are able to trample on 
Midgard's warriors?  I know that the warrior's throw and 2H weapons are 
quite weak compared tot he Armsman's crossbow and spear skills.  How has 
Mythic allowed such an absurdity to happen when the strength of Midgard 
is their ferocious might?  Makes no sense to me.  You would think that 
Warriors and Heroes would get to wear plate mail -- at least they would 
be more on par with the Armsmen.

At the beginning of the game I understood that the 3 factions were 
balanced as such: Hibernia is more magical so has more powerful magic-
users but slightly weaker fighters, Midgard is ferocious so has more 
powerful fighters but slightly weaker magic-users, and Albion is 
balanced.  So how is it that Armsmen can beat the crap out of all the 
vikings (except for perhaps the berserkers)?.

With the expansions I also think it is silly that the "God-fearing" 
people of camelot will have a new race and classes resulting from their 
friendship with satanic necromancers.  That is so uncamelot-like.

They should of just gave the Albions the ZEALOT class:  a plate-wearing 
cross-thumping psychotic that specializes in the two-handed "cross" 
weapon skill.  He drags this huge cross behind him then thumps people on 
the head with it.  Upon 50th level he possess the stigmata and bleeds 
from his hand and head.  His necklaces would be prayer beads no doubt.
