    They're using (2*DAM+1)/(DEL/10) to get DPS, by the way.

    It's because of the stupid formula they're using, which makes the damage
bonus for all weapons equal to one. Assuming level 65, you'd have a damage
bonus on the OG of 14, and of 36 on the SEWS. So better damage power
rankings would be 42 on the SEWS, and 36.5 on the OG. These numbers are
nowhere near DPS, by the way - they're just a good measure of the relative
DPS of two weapons.

    They're two-handers. EQ is mudflated, but it's not quite mudflated to
the point that 35/23 one handers exist. The best ratio one hander I can
think of is the MNK/BST Time weapon, 23/20 augmentable to 25/20 with LDoN.
