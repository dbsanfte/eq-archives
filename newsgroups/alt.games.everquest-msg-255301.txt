How about this one: you are grouped with a melee partner, and chewing 
thru mana healing him as well as keeping buffs up.  Occaisionally you 
get to where you're forced to call med breaks.

Since you can Bind Wounds while sitting, if both you and he BW while you 
sit, thats free hp regen that stacks with your cast regen and saves you 
healing mana.  When the two of you get him up to 70%, take a look at 
your mana bar.  Where would it be if you'd cast heals to get him to 70% 
instead?  Well, it would be lower by the med time you just spent while 
doing the BWs, plus the mana cost of however many heals you would have 
had to cast.

Once upon a time you had to stand to BW, and -that- made the skill 
useless for anyone with any sort of heal spell.  But now, its just free 
HP regen.

OF course the trouble with this theory is that the BW skill cap is 
pretty low for some classes (for mages its 100 I think) and so the 
-amount- of hp regen may not justify the effort, particularly at the 
high end of the game.  But its still 250hp per minute that you are 
capable of contributing at no cost to mana regen.  If my Berserk had a 
+25 hp item he could wear only while the casters were medding he 
wouldn't turn up his nose at it.
