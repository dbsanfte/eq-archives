Defiantly Lost Dungeon of Norrath.  Lots of dungeon crawling, a well
oiled group is a must for hard setting.  I lost a hard one last night
because a Rogue tried to pick open a booby trapped chest and ended
getting everyone poisoned.  4 of us died and while we were rezzed,
that still took considerable time to restore mana, get over rez
effect, rebuff, resummon pets and in the end we had to kill 12 more
when we ran out of time.  Had that chest been left alone, 57 kills in
90 minutes would have been possible.
