Intent is everything.

I'm all for 'hey I got my gimpleshriben to drop' posts, but the intent 
behind Chorkie's post is the issue.

Not knowing how the game works is fine, I've demonstrated time and time 
again how little I know about the game.  However, the key is delivery.

Starting with 'the necro didn't play how I wanted them to play' and 
building from there hasn't been very useful.  The finale being 'and I 
won't rez you' demonstrates the issue of not really understanding the 
other kind of player in EQ.

Everyone in EQ is there to have fun, to play the game, to take part, 
different people enjoy different styles of play.
