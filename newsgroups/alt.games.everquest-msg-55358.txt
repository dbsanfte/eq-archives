You're mixing analogies. :)  MY analogy was about "hey, 3 of my characters
have this bad surname, so this one should!"   YOUR analogy was to the bad
customer service, a point on which I agreed.

Slight change of subject but I'm thinking d' is short for "of," right?   If
"Coeur" means heart and "aigle" means eagle it would translate to Heart of
Eagle, or eagleheart.

Eh, translations are nasty, 'cause "of" is often part of titles.   Robin
d'Locksley (misspelled, undoubtedly) *I* would think violates (beyond the
obvious famous names rule...ignore that, I'm just using it so my point is
understood), though Heart of Eagle does not...unless Coeur is the first name
and d'Aigle is the surname, which does violate.

Eh, just petition again when that person isn't logged on. :P
