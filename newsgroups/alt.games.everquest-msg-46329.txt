Tormax/Dain/Yelinak, the only good items are the quest rewards and
even those are kinda gimpy--the Dain belt is really only good for
casters.  The last Yelinak gloves went to a cleric since none of the
meleers wanted it.  The white dragon scale boots aren't that great
(seriously, the FT 2 on it is a stupid effect...I would like it if it
had 10 more resists across the board and lose the FT 2 effect).

The three west wing dragons drop weak items with maybe one or two
fairly decent items mixed in.

For example, I grabbed the Silvery Girdle Of WeighsWayTheFuckTooMuch
tonight because no one really wanted it.  I figured, might as well
give the Dain belt to a wizard or cleric.

And forget about PoM stuff.  That zone is a total waste of time.

>I don't think hundreds is too far out of line.

Really, there's not too many jaw droppers from ToV.  There's maybe
about 40 total super drops.  Another 20 or so decent drops.  The rest
are twinkie items.
