OMG... someone who remembers GS?? I was wondering if all of us were dead by
now ;) Oh... wait a sec... you said GS3.  I recall GS when they took it
offline and 'revamped', as I sat in a quiet square with ghosts all around
me. Great game, no graphics included. Sometimes it's best to imagine. GS was
one of those times.
