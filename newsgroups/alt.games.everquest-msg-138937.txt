It appears to be 1250 _OR_ 1350 for "taunt" classes,
and around 1150 for rogues...this is all dependent on
who you talk to or get the info from.

One thing is certain, though...past a certain AC number,
increasing the stat even by leaps and bounds has a
deminishing return on investment.  Around 1250 it's
good to start focusing on other stats of the armor, one
of the most important being resists.  Having unbuffed
NORMAL FIGHTING GEAR resists of 150+ makes switching
into resist gear almost trivial, as well as pretty darn well
protected all around.  Things that increase ATK directly
(such as some of the stackable Vengence-laiden stuff
from VT) are also good, as long as you're not sacrificing
too much AC to put it on.  Although during a raid I'll
most definately ditch the AC gear for resists/ATK buffs,
simply because if I end up tanking much at all the whole
raid is dead anyways...

HP gear is also good, but like I said, I'm usually not going
to be tanking that much anyways...and I don't have a dedicated
cleric at any rate.  I CANNOT get Warrior/SK/Paladin hp numbers,
so I'll focus on other stuff.

This is all for raids, mind you.  I DO NOT tank on raids (-martin can
do it different..he's a monk), because not only do I not really have
the "build" to tank, but I'm more effective behind a mob anyways...
MUCH, MUCH more effective...like 2-3x as much.  For normal
exp groups, I can tank level 50ish mobs just fine (for a bit), and
I keep the AC gear on.  Exp groups are actually a bit more dynamic
that a raid, IF it's a raid you've done before and won 10-20x anyways.
Then it's just a time sink...exp grouping can be fun if you don't just
park yourself in Disco or something, but actually move around
and find that 40-mob pull safe spot, that nobody else knows about.

And know, "incomming North Wing" doesn't count." I get to just
watch those AoE groups...
