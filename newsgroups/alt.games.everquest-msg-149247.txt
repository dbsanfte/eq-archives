Hello all! Yesterday I installed a Linksys 4-port cable/DSL router on my
system. After that, it seems like I am being disconnected from EQ a lot. I
was dumped 4 times tonight during a 3 hour session. If I can stay on for a
whole hour I am lucky. Before yesterday, I hardly ever got disconnected.
What can I do? The information on the EQ site seems to suggest that I need
to connect my cable modem directly to my computer when I play but I don't
relish the thought of unplugging/plugging network cables whenever the urge
to play EQ hits me. Is there any other solution? What could I try?

TIA!

PS - I am also running ZoneAlarm Pro but have given EQ all necessary
permissions. It never was an issue before. Is the combo of the router AND
ZoneAlarm Pro too much for EQ to handle?
