I actually don't have a problem with the tax, its a tax we all know 
about it. So hey ho. I have a huge problem with companies such as UPS 
charging more admin than the tax or the actual delivery.

We now know how they could achieve the cheap delivery - they knew the 
admin charge was coming as well.

Very very naughty

Personally i've complained to Sony, you sit back and do nothing then 
nothing will happen. You do something, if nothing happens - at least you 
can say you tried :)

If anyone has a more useful Sony contact than listed on the Station 
pages would be great. May be only �10 but it was �10 + �7 I hadn't 
budgeted on!
