wow what a day i had in EQ today, for the last 6 lvls my mage has been
hanging around OT, LOIO and FM
just killing things looking for loot and having fun, not really questing. in
these 6 lvl i had 1 forest loop drop and one sarnak cermonial dagger. the
loop i lost in a roll and the dagger i won the roll but took pity on a
poorly equiped slighty lower lvl mage that came in second. so i sold it to
him for 200pp ( it being worth 500-700pp) well the next day (today) in the
space of 8 hours i got myself 2 sarnak daggers and 2 forest loops.
further proof that what goes around comes around.
