I think you should.  :)

And I get it just fine.  The original poster wanted to prove a point and was
willing to bastardize tests to achieve the results he was aiming for. 
Forgive me if I don't actually *understand* the point of doing such a thing,
but I *get* it just fine.

I have a level 20ish twink with a point or two over 600 AC.  My level 58
magician also has a point or two over 600 AC.  There is *no* doubt that my
magician can stand and tank a level 25 mob *better* than the warrior.  It's
not something that even needs parsed, as the warrior will get hit for 20s
and the hits on the magician won't ever be in the double digits.

Even that really doesn't prove much, as there are far too many variables
at work, maxed dodge skill on magician, for example, though that should
impact hit frequency rather than hit magnitude, but just an example.  :)

Level > all
