This is going to be very server-dependent for me. On test, I'll
probably KEI anyone who asks for it who's at least level 30 whenever I
can do so without going out of my way. On Torv, I'll only KEI people
who send me direct tells if they offer 100 plat or more and it's not
out of my way. Anyone who doesn't like that is free to go elsewhere.

I'll still do drive-by buffs when it amuses me to do so. Oh, and I've
already got a "never buff, no matter how much they offer" list on both
servers.
