just as separate point, it won't be challenging now, don't you think?

if you know about broon and you were there for the klicknik queen event and
you know about SoW and how to hug the wall, then where is the challenge?

i believe that unless you are able to forget all of that to relearn it, it
will never be challenging

it'll actually be worse, because your memories will always be the
untouchable ideal

you're right, it used to be that way, but going backwards won't bring that
back

i'm piping in here even though i haven't been on this message board since
serverwide.age went live and i quit eq 14 months ago...

<superfrigginbold>everyone</superfrigginbold> had more fun when it was new

some of the changes to the game are both helpful and unwelcome

the old game is incapturable

the best you can do, and i say this as someone who has been on both sides of
the fence, is read the comments on alla's from 2001 and 2002, on items that
are exctinct ... "ranger dmg table is #1" and "this item is so good, it's
fake!" and "how do you beat this mob? the ae is for 150!"

but on the other hand, if that guild (that's basically pulling a "the
village" in terms of what they allow inside their walls ) works, then all
the power to 'em
