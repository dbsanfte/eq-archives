City of Mist (and for that matter, Emerald Jungle) might be good for
the three of you.  The 51 will find many dark blues in CoM, although
there will be greens and light blues as well.  But there are so many
to pull that the experience comes pretty quickly.  Chance at some pHaT
lEwTz too.  The mobs should go down easily enough to the war and the
bard that your healing abilities won't be too overtaxed.
