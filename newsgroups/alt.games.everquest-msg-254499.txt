I don't know how wel this would work on your server, but stop by the
vendors in every newbie zone and starting city and buy them from the
vendors. (Everfrost, Halas, Qeynos, Q Hills, Misty, Rivervale, etc...
PoK makes this trivial.) Don't think you will get that many at one
time, but vendor diving for 30 minutes every few days got me over 400
bone chips in a few weeks on FV. (about 200 got my oger from KoS to
Ally, only thing the bone chips don't cover is guard faction, so if
Stormhammer faction goes down when you kill the king, you might have a
problem, so you would then want to farm crushbone belts and pads to
give to the Warrior GM.) Otherwise, since most people are recomending
to kill faction mobs anyway you could find some place with a high
suply of bone chip dropping mobs and start whacking them.

Alternately you can find a friendly Necro to use his flesh to bone AA
on a few dozen stacks of meat for you.
