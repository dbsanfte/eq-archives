You know, I've actually tried to reply to this post three times now, and 
each time words have failed me. I mean, going from "he doesn't like the 
graphics in WoW" to "he never played Zelda" to "you can steal cars in 
GTA3 and this is somehow a bad thing" is barking up so many different 
wrong trees I can't even begin to see the forest.

I've given up on gathering my thoughts in a coherent whole, so here's 
the whole rant in unstructured form, make of it what you will:

-I'll take one hour of the freedom, humour, atmosphere and exhilaration 
of any game in the GTA3 series over all the "well-thought-out puzzles" 
over the entire history of the Zelda series. This includes stealing a 
whole bunch of cars over said hour.

-Perceived "maturity" concerns me not. I've happily read Harry Potter 
books in public.

-Zelda is going hyperrealistic for its next game. The fan riots over 
Link's look in The Wind Waker probably had more to do with uglyness than 
maturity.

-I actually like the WoW graphics better than the EQ2 ones. Realism is 
harder to do, therefore, it's easier to fail at.

-I despise cell-shading in games. I think it's a stupid, ugly and 
artistically bankrupt fad that has lasted much too long. I don't speak 
from ignorance, I've actually painted cells myself, and I've worked many 
years on 2D-3D integration; mostly, I know where it can work and where 
it doesn't, and why. The Wind Waker is a better attempt than most (I 
think Herdy Gerdy did it better, for example), but to me it looks more 
weird than wonderful.

-You can do cartoony graphics without trying to ape the limitations of a 
completely different medium, see GTA3 and WoW - both very cartoony, both 
still very 3D.
