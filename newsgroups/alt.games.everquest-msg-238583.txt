Believe me, you didn't miss out on much. The bloom fades off that rose 
pretty fast. I made master architect in no time flat when the game went 
live. (I think I was the 3rd one in our galaxy.) I built everything, all 
the way up to PA halls. I had a large home and some smalls and tons of 
harvesters spread over the accounts we were using.

It's neat at first, but it gets boring fast.
