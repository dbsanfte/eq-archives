Deluxe sewing kits were a one off that converted all the regular
sewing kits from 8 slot to 10 slot if you had them in your inventory a
long time ago.  They reintorduced them as a casino prize with other
deleted items (like the DE mask that works from your inventory). 
Despite them having 0%WR they are still a nice item to have.

The Tinkerer's Satchel is 5250pp with enough cha & purchased from the
gnome down deep in Sol A - the one by where Gabby spawns.
