Yes indeed, if you do NRo LDoN, instead of picking one at random, you 
are being self serving.  Is that Need or Greed?  Are the two not 
synonymous?  You need it, you are greedy for it.

The dicotomy works only when its a question of whether its something you 
are going to use versus sell.  With LDoN points, its always use, not 
sell, as far as I can see.

I don't think there's anything wrong with it per se, except that if some 
other class has a particular need for a different camp, but all healers 
refuse to do that camp because they need NRo points, and all melee 
refuse to do NRo because they need MM points, then you run into the 
"everyone is selfish so nobody wins" conundrum.  EQ isn't designed to 
reward everyone for each camp equally, we are supposed to win in the 
long run by supporting each other.

But since SOME healers insisting on doing only NRo doesn't prevent much 
of anything, you benefit without the consequences.

If its your intent to stick to NRo only for a short time, and then pour 
out the benefits of having done so to others by subsequently doing the 
camps they need, then you are trading the short term selfishness for the 
long term benefit of all; after all, its going to be easier for everyone 
in those future camps if you have the spell when doing them, instead of 
spreading things around so you do the same number of missions all at 
random, none with the spell till the end of the set.

Its still a whole other area of discussion than the NBG one, though.

Splendid
