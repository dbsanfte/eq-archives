Do you talk just to hear yourself? Your assertion that most top guilds
use DKP systems is just wrong and exposes your continued ignorance in
a field on which you continue to claim expertise and spew opinions.

Killing MObs is work. Getting loot is not a bonus. It's the only
reason raiding guilds kill things in all but a few, rare cases. Anyone
who tells you that they raid for other reasons is playing word games.

My experience of how much loot players get is that it has very little
to do with what what level you're raiding at and is much more
influenced by the quality of your current gear compared to the rest of
the guild, the amount of time that you put into raiding, how critical
your performance is to your guild, and a host of degenerate causes
that break down to how well-liked and respected you are by the guild.
