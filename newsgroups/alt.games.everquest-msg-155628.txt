I would have to share the same sentiments.

I am RL male and prefer to play female characters 'cause they look cool. Sex
is irrelevant as far as stats go so I might as well play the game with
something I want to look at.

My wife's main is a male druid. People are shocked when they find out he's a
she in RL. They have said she plays like a man. I don't understand that.

I have only run into two people who have flirted with my female characters.
Once I was playing a human druid (female) and wife was playing a
human/ranger fem. Some big barbarian male gave me a missletoe while we were
crafting at the bank. He said you know what a missletoe is? I said I was
male in RL. He said 'Ewwwwwwww'. I then told him my wife was playing the
ranger and you could giver her the missletoe. I added that I didn't mind. He
said 'Ewwwwwwww' and left.0

Wife and I still laugh over that one...



I also have a couple male characters...
