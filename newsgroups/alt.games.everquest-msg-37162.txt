That would be true if that was their mission.  I don't agree with that.  Is
Vox or Naggy harder now than before?  No.  Is Gorenaire harder now than
before?  Kinda doubt it, but I wouldn't know.

Velious was added because (besides for the cash influx that expansions
typically give) there was a shortage of high level zones.  Hell, so was
Kunark.

I'm guessing but I think that Verant has decided that there's now enough
zones for everyone (I would agree) but another influx of cash would be cool,
and kitties are cute.
