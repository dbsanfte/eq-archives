If at all possible, rez the tank last. He'll want to pull as soon as
he's back to full health, or at least almost every tank I've ever worked
with insisted on it. 

Well, Ok, you probably have to rez *YOU* last.

Order for rezzes:
Enchanter.
Necro- unless the necro was bound close by- then move to other end- that
way twitching happens.
(both to help you continue, via clarity and twitching)
Bard (for the dreaded mana song please)
Anyone else with pets- mage/shaman.
Druid/Wizard
Hybrids: pally, ranger, shadowknight
(They will all need to mem spells and med up)
Tank
Then you can rez the poor sod who's done all the pulling, the rogue or
monk.
Then you get your rez.

This assumes of course that you are in a safe spot.

If you aren't, then I'd probably go with:
tanks
Anyone who can heal
Anyone who can give mana to healers
Anyone else
You last.
