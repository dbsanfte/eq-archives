My ISP did a similar thing. I've been signed up with them for over two
years, and I have yet to have gotten a bill from them that didn't say I had
credit. (it's always been between $9 and $13) I have no idea what's going on
with them, but I'm scared to say anything or I'll probably get a two-year
ISP bill all at once. =P
