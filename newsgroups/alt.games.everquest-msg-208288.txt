	How do I get to Freeport?  I found some boats in the Dwarf City
in the Butcherblock and got on one.  It went out into the water and crossed
into a new zone (??? Deep) and then stopped.  It _seemed_ as though
I could steer the boat as though I were walking but I couldn't really tell
if I actually was or what direction I should steer it in in any case. 
Eventually I fell off and gated out of the water before some sea monster
ate me...

	So, I'm in Faydwer and want to get to Freeport.  Does Norrath
have travel agents?  Do I need to practice my swimming?
