There is video lag in some zones in Kunark... WW comes to mind due to the
animation of the trees, and some people are protesting Verant by not going
to those zones.  I personally haven't had trouble in any Kunark zones other
than WW.

As for things you can try:
more RAM
change resolution
Don't play in fullscreen mode

Is the lag so bad it is unplayable?
