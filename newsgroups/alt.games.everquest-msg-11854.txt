my level 9 ranger tanked very well. There were so many spell casters and the
odd rogue doing massive backstab damage that the monsters didn't last more
than a few hits.

Monsters that conned red to me couldn't kill me as fast as the clerics were
healing me.

Loved it, it was the first time I had tanked, normally I play the wizards
and cleric characters.

I think the rest of  the group were very experienced, so the fact that I was
new didn't matter. I just kept the monster busy while they did their things.
