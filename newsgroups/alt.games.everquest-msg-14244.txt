Hello

First let me say EQ is a great game. I had fun playing for 5 months and 46
levels, but now I'm bored with it and looking to move on.

What I liked about EQ:
1. Massive multiplayer online game with a large 3-D persistent world.
2. Variety of clases/spells/items/etc.

What I didn't like about EQ:
1. PvE is the primary way to advance (which gets routine).
2. In PvP, time played (equals better gear) is rewarded more than skill.
3. Too hard for casual player to consistiently find groups (minor gripe)

So I guess I'm looking for a MMO game with a large 3-D persistent world where
PvP is the primary means for character advancement. PvP skill should also be
an important factor in deciding outcomes. (If it was pretty easy to find
other people to group with--that would be a bonus.)

Any game recommendations?

Thanks!
