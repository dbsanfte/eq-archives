I went there, and found out how to install it within 5 minutes. But, I dont
think you'll be getting it running too soon, especially if you couldnt even
find the instructions. Its fairly complicated. There is no install file to
link to. Try reading the help forum. Or ask there, it looks like they *love*
that. :)
