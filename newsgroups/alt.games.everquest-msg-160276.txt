Biggest reason was far simpler, since there is no "Do you wish to be
bound here" message, melees were getting bound by casters without
asking in some wicked places. So it was changed where you can bind
others. Least thats the legend from way back. Seems they just would
have added the message like the rez. Anyway it has been kept to this
day and yes it was and is a big pita.
