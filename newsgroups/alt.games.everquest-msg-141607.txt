Neither portal is dangerous.  The one through SFG (obviously)
runs through a zone filled with druid and ranger trainers as
well as the assorted other "good" NPCs and brings you into an
area filled with other "good" NPCs.  The one through Blackburrow
doesn't require entering SFG or put you "in town" and is probably
the better choice for "evil" races.  I don't think either is
dangerous for anyone who can invis, as long as it lasts anyway.

There's plenty to hunt at 35; lower for a group.  I'd guess a
full group of 30's could do well in some areas, maybe even
lower if it was a well-balanced group.

As far as "NOT going," that depends on the reason why you're there.
There's little danger to anyone with a SoW or Invis, at least in
the vast majority of the zone.  Not much for a level 20 to hunt,
though, if anything.
