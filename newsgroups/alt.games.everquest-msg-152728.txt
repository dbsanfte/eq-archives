And the damage healed display and safe spots really impact your
gameplay that much? Frankly, I'd rather them focus on the glaring
errors. I don't give a rat's ass if the game tells me I was only
healed for 90 damage as long as I'm really healed for the 100 the
spell should do... A "safe spot" isn't worth patching the whole zone
over in itself. Patching the zone should only be done when a more
pressing need is being addressed.
