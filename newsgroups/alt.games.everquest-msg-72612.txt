Can't remember when crits start but 12th level sounds pretty close.
I have heard a few theories on this and they all follow the same pattern.
(if you know any different please enlighten)
When you attack something the server is generating "random" number based on
your skill, level vs the targets AC, Level (basically, it's rolling a dice
for you) when this score is either the minimum possible to hit the target or
maximum possible to do the same then a critical hit is scored. Another
theory is that if the damage score "rolled" is the absolute minimum then it
score a Crit. and recalculate the damage. Apparently (and I tend to follow
this belief) dexterity helps in the scoring of critical hits, tho how I am
not sure.

Crippling blows are scored the same way but will only happen when you are
beserk.
