I beg to differ.

Jakugg - 55 troll warrior
Tiru - 55 dwarf cleric

Most of the time, it's just us. All the way from level 25ish.

It's incredibly easy to add anything to a warrior cleric team to have an
even better group. Warrior is designed to take damage. Cleric are designed
to heal damage. What a happy blend.

But, there are many happy combos. The Important Thing- is play who you want
to play. And then figure out a style to make it work.
