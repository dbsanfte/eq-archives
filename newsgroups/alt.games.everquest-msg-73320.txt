Heres my plat guide - works well:

If your lower level go to lguk, collect FS weapons and pp from frogs. Each
one drops between 3 and 5 plat and some drop FS worth 3 to 5 plat. I was
making about 500p in a few hours along with EXP and if a rare drops even
more.

If your higer up go to Sebelis. You can easily make a kp in a few hours
there. Lots of good gem drops and stuff. Plus again you get exp and the
chance for rares.
