On 10/12 when I mentioned that shaman are becoming fewer and fewer [due 
to their shortcomings at the high end], you replied, "They are?  Had not 
noticed any such trend.  We have too many in our guild as it is, and I 
rarely have any trouble finding a group."

I'm not trying to call you out, I was just wondering what differences 
you've started to see since then that have changed your opinion about the 
shaman's desirability in groups. I see the doomsdayers on the Shaman 
boards and just like to hear others' perspectives as well.
