I'm not convinced of anything by Random Prexian. His posting history
here is zero, which means that either he's never posted until now, or
he's someone who munged all his ID information to hide his regular
identity just to attack someone - in other words, a ball-less wonder. 

Either way, RPs credibility is far more in question.


I play on Prexus, and I know Sensei in-game. I mean, I don't hang out
with him or go skeet-shooting or anything, but I run into him fairly
regularly, and I have no negative impressions. 

I still think Martin is overreacting with his claim that a GM poofed
the mob when it's far more likely that, as someone else noted, it was
a bug in a buggy game.
