Head on into Monterey or Santa Cruz, you'll find lots of 'em. Best
place is to find a hobby shop (there's lots of 'em there, too many),
and just get to know the people there. The shopowners are usually
gamers themselves. 

There are also actual organized groups of roleplaying, such as
Amtgard, though that is more combat-orientated and isn't really "sit
around and roleplay and roll dice". It's actual physical exertion. I
never got into it, but a friend of mine who was an 18 (though 17 at
the time) year old female loved it.
