OK, I'm seeing a lot of people running around with names of the form

    Soandso of EQ1ServerName

However, of all of those, none I've seen have been "of The Nameless".
Anyone else notice that particular servers seem underrepresented on
EQ2?

I'm on Antonia Bayle in EQ2, which is a role playing server, so perhaps
that might have something to do with it...although I can't think of any
particular reason people from The Nameless would be avoiding an RP server.

Speaking of these titles, are these things per account or per character?
Do you get to choose among all the EQ1 servers for the title, all the EQ1
servers you had characters on, or just the EQ1 servers you had a character
with the same name as the EQ2 character?  (I know...I could experiment, but
I don't want to do anything that isn't reversible yet, since if I can only
do this for one character, it will be my Dark Elf mage, who has the same
name as my Wizard from The Nameless, but I haven't played him yet, since I
played a Dark Elf mage (with that name) in beta, and so now am trying out
something in Qeynos).
