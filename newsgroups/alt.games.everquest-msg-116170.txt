I think the animals are on a seperate spawn table anyway. No way to prove it
except for noticing what you kill and what seems to spawn in its place.

In other words kill the worms, the mammoths , and the wolves to spawn more
wolves. The spawn time on the animals may be long as well. I have heard a
rumour of 2 hrs which I am unsure of.

Caveat ; this fits my experience hunting this zone but I can in no way prove
it. Its entirely possible that from my limited hunting here I am observing a
subset of the actual possibility.
