I have no idea if the quest is still busted, but as for doing it
yourself at 50, no.  You can do the whole thing yourself until you get
up to killing Fergul, but to take him down you're gonna need some
help.  I did it at 50, and a 54 necro buddy of mine helped me take
down Fergie.  He was still pretty tough.  Seems to have a pretty high
MR.

Still, the legs are VERY nice.  Worth the work.  :-)
