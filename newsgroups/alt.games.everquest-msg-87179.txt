Actually, that was changed a while back, now you don't get that message when
you fail.  This removes the assinine "You can no longer advance in skill
level..." followed by "You lacked the skill to combine...."  Unfortunately,
it also means that you have to succeed in order to know that the item is not
trivial to you.

Also, as your skill gets higher above the trivial level of the item, you
will succeed more often.

I understand that the odds are somewhere between 2 and 5 percent for any
combine, no matter how low your skill.
