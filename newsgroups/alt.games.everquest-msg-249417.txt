When I was first shown the way to HK I was given very strict instructions to
have SoW, Invis, stick to the wall and don't stop for anything!

I have been wiped once coming from HK to Kithicor though, thought I would be
safe at the zone line so I sat my character down while I left my desk for a
coffee or something and came back to see myself splattered on the ground.
Not that a /shout train would have helped me anyway :)
