This was not the case, and is not the case.

As of right now, if an Iksar has a plus 2 regen from his race, and 2 points of
buying Regen AA, he will be getting 4 points overall.

Before, when it was bugged, they would get 2 from thier race, and 4 from
buying 2 levels of Regen AA, for a total of 6 points overall.

He wants the bugged version back.  (big suprise)
