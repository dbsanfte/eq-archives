This is very true. Only a few classes can solo effectively (druid and necro
come to mind) but even those eventually have to start grouping to go for the
better mobs.

As a mage I can solo, but almost never do it unless I need to get some
tradeskill components and farm greenies. I've found that getting in a group,
any group, is way more effective then just soloing. At lower levels there
might be some persons who can't play their char, but around lvl 25 even the
idiots start to understand how they can benefit their groups best.

The groups are usually basically the same. At least 1 tank and 1 healer are
necessary. From level 30 and beyond it's almost impossible to hold a camp
without a good nuker or crowd-controller for the bad pulls and stepped-up
slaughtering.
Usually certain players in a group are given certain tasks and some classes
are better at those task then others. ie:
If you have a cleric and a shaman in the group, the cleric will be primary
healer and the shaman back-up while he debuffs the mobs and bufss the tanks.
With a mage and a wizard in the group, the wizard usually does the end-nukes
and the mage goes for debuff, damshields and pet control, but nukes when
required.
In both cases the secondary can take on the role of the primary, but is not
proficient enough with it to keep the same pace.

If you want to learn/see good groups go to the OverThere when you're at a
good level. And look there for a chain-pulling group. I've only been in a
chain-puller in OT 3 times now, but it's simply amazing to see when everyone
knows what he can and must do.
