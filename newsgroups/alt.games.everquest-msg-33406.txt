You left out the Ogre's best tank trait, no stun from the front. In
the end stats won't matter, and gear makes up for a lot of it, but no
piece of gear will ever give a non-ogre immunity to frontal stuns.
When pulling without SOW, walk backwards to your group. No fear of the
annoying spins. Not being stunned equates to more attacks, and
therefore more taunt. Taunting is your #1 priority as a Warrior.
Travel isn't that big of a deal. The places you can't go with the
Ogre, you can go to with the Cleric. Being too big for dungeons can be
a pain, just buy some shrink potions with all of your rez cash.
