There are three difficult parts to this:

Firstly, HQ Lion Pelts are a rare drop off Highland Lions in NK. HQ Cat
Pelts will not do. I killed 90 Highlands for my first pelt, though I got my
second within 10 further kills.

Secondly, it is surprising how many 39+ Enchanters do not have the Distill
Mana spell! In fact, the last three Enchs I have asked have all been 50+,
and two of them didn't even know there was such a spell!

Thirdly, they trivial at (around) 225 so finding a high-level tailor is
essential. My quiver was made by a 180 tailor on the first try for me,
though he was in total around 6 out of 10 attempts for Quivers.

The combination of this means they fetch 5-6k when sold!

Component summary:

High Quality Lion [*not* Cat] Pelt (Highland Lions in NK only)
Griffon Feather (Off any Griffxxxs - get them in NK while you camp HLions!)
Aviak Oil (Foraged Aviak Egg from Butcherblock + water -> Brewing triv. 104)
Vial Distilled Mana (Poison Vial + 2 Sapphires -> Lvl 39 Ench spell)
Fleeting Quiver Pattern

And finally, does it make a difference? Boy yes! I grouped with a Ranger of
same level and using the same bow to bow-root some Ghouls, and I was clearly
shooting faster than he was. The Ranger sites have various technical trial
results, but I am more interested in what I see ;)
