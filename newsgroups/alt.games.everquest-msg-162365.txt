And if you'd like to hunt where there are no animals and/or there
is not room to fear kite?  Or are you saying that Rangers should
only be able to solo outdoor zones full of animals?  I have yet
to play a Ranger past 17, so soloing a Ranger has always been
trivial to me.  :)  But I think it'd be nice if at least one
melee class was decent soloing (I don't count BLs as melee, they're
pet handlers).  Monks used to be decent soloers when well equipped,
but that depended on a defensive capability that way overpowered
the Monk class.  I simply can't see how being able to shoot a
rooted mob overpowers the Ranger, or how that has anything to do
with the alleged overbalanced damage output for high level Ranger
Archery.  OTOH, if they want to make it so that any damage gives
a shot a breaking root (yes, DoTs and melee too), then I'm fine
with it.  I'm tired of game mechanics and changes to game mechanics
that seem not only "unreal" (a lot of that is unavoidable) but also
obviously misdirected and stupid.  /ramble off
