Surveys are almost worthless of course and gun crimes are way up.

 Gun crimes during the first 10 months of the annual period have tripled in
 most of the urban areas which have so far submitted statistics to the Home
 Office. [Sir John Stevens, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner] said:
 "The price of hiring or buying a gun has come down because there are more
 guns circulating." Handgun crime has soared past levels last seen before
 the Dunblane massacre of 1996 and the ban on the weapons that followed.
The ban on ownership of handguns was introduced in 1997. It was hoped that
 the measure would reduce the number of handguns available to criminals.
 According to internal Home Office statistics, however, handgun crime is
 now at its highest since 1993.
