It's not really that good for a level 4.  I took my level 4 necro in,
and usually can't get more than one kill before something wanders by, or
a train comes, and I've got to run out.

How hard is it to get to Paineel for non-Erudites?  On one of my
secondary servers, I've got a level 9 Human Monk who follows Quellious,
and a level 8 Human Cleric who follows Rodcet Nife.  What will it take
to get these past the guards?
