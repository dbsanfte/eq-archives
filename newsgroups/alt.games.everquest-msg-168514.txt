}If 10% of the people in the world are dishonest, then 10% of the

This is assuming, of course, that a dishonest person is either always 
fraudulent on principle, or just as likely to be fraudulent regardless of 
how he is motivated.

I think a dishonest person is more likely to behave dishonestly if it will 
save him money, as opposed to mana.  A dishonest person is also less likely 
to behave dishonestly if it will cost him future business or harm his 
reputation publically.  This is evidenced by the huge number of port cheats 
who try to come up with an excuse.

Personally, I don't charge for ports.  I rarely say more than 'hi!' to the 
portee beforehand.  So if they tip, goody for me.  And I make good money 
that way.  Apparently, a lot of people want that sort of service.

They ask for a port in /ooc, I do /tar portee, /inv, begin casting soe.  As 
soon as they join, they usually say hi or something, so I say hi back as 
I'm memming the port to wherever they want to go, and the ring to where I 
wanna go next, and foliage shield if it isn't very safe where we're going.  
Then I see:

You begin to cast Winds of the South
portee is interested in making a trade
portee is interested in making a trade
Loading, Please Wait...

So then I know I should stick around for a sec when I get there. :)
