Well, that is an entirely differnt problem, that is due to the changes 
that have been made to seriously remove the difficulty involved in 
levelling that used to give players a chance to learn these things.

But, I was a newbie with my shaman.  He is the first character I played 
seriously, the first one that made it past level 12.  I learned how to 
root and nuke mobs by seeing what my spells did, and using that 
information.  Eventually, I learned how to root and rot also.  The 
difference is that I did not fly through the early levels, as I started 
my shaman long before the changes that made those levels so trivial even 
for most newbies.

At higher levels of play, I will agree, the message itself is not 
relevant anymore.  The message works reasonably well at lower levels and 
that changes over time as you level.  It used to be that levelling took 
long enough that you learned things like this, perhaps it has been dumbed 
down too much now so that players don't learn the basics at lower levels 
anymore.
