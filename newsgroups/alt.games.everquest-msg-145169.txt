Yeah, but the 4 or 5 times I've given them a try, my snare (Atol's, since
I'm a Wizard) was resisted.  The first one or two, I then channeled root,
tried to snare again, got another resist, had root break, channeled root
again, and absconded.  The rest, I just channeled root and absconded.

Other Wizards tell me I just had a really unlucky streak, and that these
things are no more resistant to snaring than anything else in the zone, but
I've been avoiding them anyway. :-)
