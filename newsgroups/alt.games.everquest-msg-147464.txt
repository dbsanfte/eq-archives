Fact: um... 99% of the people stayed home watching TV today instead of 
going out and doing something revolting for us to report on.  Well, the 
Miller* kid tried to eat a live goat again, but he's -always- doing that.

Hmm.  Can we re-run yesterday's story again?  Will anyone notice?  Maybe 
if we can arrange for them to feel guilty for not caring about it 
enough...
