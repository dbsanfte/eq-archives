[snip]

Technical merit:  4.3

Hits all the required parts for a casual troll (spelling, grammar,
etc.) but avoided the more difficult trolls such as mentions of
newsgroup regulars by either name or hot-button.  Included
other required steps such as an inaccurate rationale (all non-US
EQ players obviously don't live in the same time zone, for instance),
the standard preemptive messages, as well as the made-up name
and masturbation/Internet porn reference.

Artistic merit:  4.5

The Paramount mention is a relatively rare tactic.  Most trolls
aren't clever enough to offer such obvious "You're a Star Trek
geek flaming Internet geeks!' bait.  Obvious lack of focus in
flaming Internet geeks along with EQ players lowers the score,
however, as does use of the tried-and-true VAK lines.  The
lack of focus and readily identified tactics indicate the troll
has yet to achieve the quality needed for international
competition.
