    I found that as I built reputation as a cleric, I was less and less
concerned about saying "no" to folks. As word gets out about your cleric
skill, or your ability to turn a Karnor's train into a good pull, then you
don't care if Joe Blow's mother's hampster's cousin is in guild X and
telling all of them how you said "no" to THEM. The people you've grouped
with know you, and if you're fun to group with they'll group with you again.

    I prefer to put them on /ignore. I have enough of a sharp tongue that I
know it's better to remove all temptation to respond, and all distraction
from whatever you're doing. After a few weeks they can usually come back
off.
