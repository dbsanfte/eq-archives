Such is implied by the facts.  It is well known that any bug that is found
to be easily exploitable by the players is fixed in emergency patch.  There
are exceptions but they are few and minor and not excessively abused.  The
fact that kei is being used as it is for so long without emergency patch to
fix it is implication that it is a design and not a bug.
