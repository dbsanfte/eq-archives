I'm not sure exactly what would be popping up and minimizing EQ, but I have
found that of the things I use, those that can are: Task Scheduler events that
open programs which like to announce themselves, ICQ, any bidirectional printer
driver if you run out of ink or paper while background printing the entire
eqtraders or eqatlas sites (grin), and (not that I have a problem with this)
Norton Antivirus when it finds something on your system.

ZoneAlarm is nice, it somehow manages to bring up alerts without minimizing EQ.
