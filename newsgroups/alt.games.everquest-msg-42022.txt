Okay dimwit let's tear your post to bits.

are.

Your analogy is worse than the one you're attacking.  Plenty of people over
there hate terrorism, don't harbor terrorists, and wouldn't harbor them
unless there was no other choice.  And sometimes, there is no other choice.
If some large, unshaven, mean-looking men came to your door with guns and
told you, "We're spending the night here," you know what you'd do, Zooli?
That's right, you'd let them stay the night, and I bet you'd piss yourself
in the process.  You would be innocent of wrongdoing, since your alternative
was death.  In many countries, you might be able to dial the police while
the bad guys weren't looking, but if the bad guys were smart they'd tie you
up so you couldn't move, and furthermore we're talking about a country
without much technology; there may not be much of a mechanism for Afghani
people to contact the authorities -- such as they may be -- quickly.

More like cancer, I'd say.  You cut out the tumor and the patient recovers.
Sure, it hurts, and it leaves a scar, but life goes on.  The patient will
most likely be thankful to the operating surgeon for that fact.

But

You're forgetting that the rabid dog was owned by a harmless suburban family
of four.  Would you kill the family -- in fact, why not raze the entire
neighborhood -- because their dog contracted rabies?  The family is very sad
and sorry that their beloved friend came to such an end, but it is something
they could not control and had no part in.  If they were aware of the
problem and knew what the only solution could be, they would have ordered
the dog's death or shot it themselves.  The problem is that diseases of the
human mind are much less obvious than a virus.  Look at American serial
killers.  Oh, wait, you can't, at least not knowingly; they look just like
everyone else.  Remember Jeffrey Dahmer?  Everyone who knew him thought he
was reasonably normal.  Would you advocate killing all his acquaintances
because they failed to realize he was eating people?

I hope your next post is at least as incisive and well thought out as your
last, otherwise we poor dull readers might not be able to grasp it.
