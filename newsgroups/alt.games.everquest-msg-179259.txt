There was always some sort of check to see if the mob would agro.
I used to use Lull line spells to pull giants in the FM fort.  They
definitely helped there, it was not uncommon to have giants standing
not quite far enough apart to avoid chain agro, especially at the
back of the fort.  And I got agro on less than 50% of the resists.
This was also true at much lower level pulling Orcs in EC.  A resist
was never a guaranteed agro in my experience, dating back to five or
six months after original release in '99.  The reason I eventually
quit using Lulls was that they simply did not reduce assist radius
enough in most places, the mobs would chain even when lulled (and
I'm not certain of this, but it sure seemed to be utterly useless vs.
undead, I never managed to avoid chain agro using Lull on undead).
