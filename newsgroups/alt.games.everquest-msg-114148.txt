As a monk I used to keep fishing grubs in my ammo slot to prevent shurikens
from filling both the range and ammo slots after I throw something,
increasing my weight by 0.5.  With the last patch this doesn't work any
more, I got the same message you did.  If you put the ammo you are throwing
in the ammo slot, or make it empty, you should be able to throw again.
