i always thought that most mobs ran the same speed as pc's, so they would
stay the same distance behind you all the time unless you lag or something.
i remember when a group member was running from an npc and i ran after him.
i was right next to the npc the whole time, so i guess we were running the
same speed.  haven't really experimented with it too much, so maybe i'm
wrong, but i'm pretty sure everyone is the same speed (except for some mobs
like the ones in the dreadlands.  i learned how fast they were the hard
way....)
