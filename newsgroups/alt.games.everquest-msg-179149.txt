Right now the only thing that can be dyed is plate armor.  There is a new
feature coming with Legacy of Ykesha that will allow other items to be dyed,
however it looks like it's a solid tint overlay of a single color.  What
that means is that you probably can't dye anything that is a dark color.
Also, you can't dye just portions of anything, it's all or nothing.  So for
now, you are stuck with a black robe.
