In my opinion, DAOC is a watered down EQ with a good PvP system. If
they is better or worse I don't know.

As far as to try or not: I would say at first you will enjoy it more
than EQ because it will be fresh and new to you. After that, who
knows. If EQ is "getting old" to you, give it a try. If you like PvP*
give it try. Just don't cancel your EQ account yet; I know just as
many people that love DAOC as those that hate it.

* PvP in DAOC is different from other games like EQ. There are PvP
zones and PvE zones. So you choose if you want to PvP or not. Also
there is no penalty for PvP death other than the long trip back to
your bind point (can't bind in a PvP zone).
