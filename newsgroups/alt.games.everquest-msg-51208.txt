You're shitting me, right?

As a level 51 druid all I *NEED* memmed to do rares in FM is Starfire,
Ice, Drifting Death, Immolate, Snare, Root, and Levitate.  Seven
spells.  I usually keep SoW up in the last slot so that if I'm not
paying attention and Wolfform drops (after two and a half hours) I can
get speedyfeet up fast.  SLN and Thorncoat have such long durations,
that it's trivial to swap them out as necessary.  This is why Tunare
gave us Spellbook hotkeys.
