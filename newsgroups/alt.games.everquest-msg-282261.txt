There is a button on the character select screen "Enter Tutorial".  Turn
that off and you'll end up somewhere else.  You can turn it on again before
you hit level 10 if you figure out your problem and want to go back into the
tutorial (highly recommended, it's a pretty good tutorial and not a bad way
to level up to 10).
