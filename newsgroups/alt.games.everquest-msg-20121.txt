Hehe, yep.

Have even have some newbies (ONLY in Steamfont for some reason, maybe gnomes are
more interesting for stupid people *s*) run up to me first to beg for some
armor. When i tell them i dont have any stuff to give them i got told i was
lying, they saw me auctioning a Fine Plate bracer before.
As if i would give a 75pp Fine Plate bracer (large size even, so they could not
even use it) to a begging newbie.
