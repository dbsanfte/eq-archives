I agree, I'll quite happily zone out, and congradulate myself on having 
made it down to the wire and still survived, again.

If I'm not grouped with a member of every buffing class that I'm wearing 
a buff from, I have a lot to protect.  If I -am- buffed up, I still have 
the mana and irritation cost of all those buffs to protect.  And I 
probably have mana left in my pool to protect.  And in many zones, CR is 
going to be impossible, which means a 10 to 15 minute delay in waiting 
for my body.  Too, in many zones the graveyards themselves are death 
traps due to the fact that many other people think the same way Sean and 
I do, that if we -can- get out, we -do- get out... but they aren't as 
careful about it as I am; I at least take the most train free approach I 
can manage to the zone outs, they'll happily cut straight thru the GY 
even if going around would be just as easy.

That, mind you, is with my epic equipped cleric, even, where the rez is 
a guaranteed certainty.  Consider then my bard, who often plays for 
hours in POD without seeing a cleric in the GY unless he hires one... a 
dry loot is a likely result of death, or bribing a cleric with 100pp or 
so to zone in and do me a favor I could have avoided by simply firing up 
selos and beating feet, something I'm very well equipped to do.  Why 
zone out at all?  Because the mobs in POD have an annoying habit of 
restoring themselves to 40% HP when almost dead, and I can run OOM and 
be unable to charm another killing machine.  Spend 10 minutes wearing 
that last one down to near death, to see it back at 40% again... bah, 
I'm zoning and no cries of courtesy are going to stop me, I'm weary but 
not willing to die so that people foolish enough to go AFK at a zone 
line might live and not learn.

Rude?  If you will have it so, so be it, but while I'm willing to try 
not to hurt people, I'm not willing to die to avoid it.  After all, as 
you say, whats death to them anyway?  They'll be back in the graveyard 
in ten or fifteen minutes and after a rez its only a couple kills till 
they are back where they were.  Heck, I'll even log in my cleric and do 
it if they aren't equipped to do it for themselves.
