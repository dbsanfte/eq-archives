The question has been asked and answered here a number of times, if you
search on groups.google.com, you will find the answer.  As I recall, it's
Level*(2+WIS/5) for Wisdom up to 200.  For wisdom over 200, each point of
wisdom is worth 5.8 mana, regardless of level.  Same formula for INT
casters, using INT instead.  I can't answer for whether or not this is
completely accurate, but it is the formula used on the castersrealm mana
calculater.
