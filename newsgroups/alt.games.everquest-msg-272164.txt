Nope, paying isn't the same as begging.  But when you get told "I can make
your complicated patterns for X xp, or these easier items for 4 times X xp",
guess what you gotta do to make him even consider making the patterns?

One of the pieces of armour I make takes a set of rings (7 SP), a pattern
(maker wants 30 SP), and 3 padding (maker wants 50 SP each).  This armour
won't sell for 70 SP, let alone break-even 187 SP.
