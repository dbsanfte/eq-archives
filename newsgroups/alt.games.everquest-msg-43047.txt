Well, me for instance, as I have for the same price a cloak that is 7ac and 4 WIS (Mammoth
hide form Goblin Alchemist in permafrost).

Burynai Hide Boots, 5ac 2 STA (?) 2 WIS 125pp or loot from Lesser Icebones all over Kunak.

That said, 5-10pp is a good price for a tp to a new tper (L29 druid or wizzie), but pocket
fluff to someone who has gone to the trouble of getting the GD tp spell and key (and is high
enough level).
