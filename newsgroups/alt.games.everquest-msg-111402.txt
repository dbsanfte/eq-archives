Oy vey <grin>. One of these days I really should take a beginners
course in Hebrew ("Hebrew for Goys?"), since I often study ceremonial
magic* and much of the occult material comes from that language.

In the less-changed translations, it still boils down to a "suffer not
a something-or-other to live", which smacks of the cranky God of the
Old testament, no matter how you read it.

About the best that either of these defenses gets is "Thou shalt not
tolerate a sorceress". I'm a cynic, as you no doubt know by now, so I
sense some political correctness sneaking around. If indeed PC is part
of the picture there, I'd frankly prefer the more honest translation. 

But hey, we Wiccans make our religion up as we go a lot of the time,
so who am I to begrudge Christians if they want to rewrite some of
their literature?

Unfortunately, my knowledge of the Bible isn't what it probably should
be. My copy is stuffed in a box somewhere, next to the Gita, in the
basement. I've been informed by my dad that I'll be inheriting the
family Bible, which is a monstrously large tome, bound in crafted
leather, written entirely in German, and several generations old. By
any definition I care to apply it is an object of great power, and it
will have a place of considerable honor in my home.


* For others interested, I recommend "Three Books of Occult
Philosophy" by Agrippa. Llewellyn currently has in print a
well-annotated translation for about $40 USD.
