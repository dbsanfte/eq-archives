Uh, so? You're exploring a tangent that isn't relative to the present 
discussion. Person, people, it matters not. The same parties are not 
responsible for executive decisions made at this level for the two 
different product lines.

Again, so? You're just being argumentative now. If you're tactic is to 
merely wear me down with superfluous lines of debate, then you win. This 
is getting riduculous.

Another invalid analogy. It would be more correct if you had given me 
carte blanche to take $15 out of your wallet every month, and I only 
grabbed $13 one month, going back a couple of weeks later and taking the 
other $2. Granted, I can see where you might get a bit peeved if it was 
your last $2 at the time, but even then you really shouldn't begrudge me 
so much for taking it as yourself for failing to plan for it (an 
accounting error equally if not more negligent than what SoE did) or 
letting your cash on hand get that low in the first place.
