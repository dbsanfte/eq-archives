Yes, I  think that was it.. When I installed Luclin, I installed it on
an older machine (read less diskspace).. When I moved to my new
machine, I just copied the EQ folder. Maybe it just didn't install the
new textures because I was low on diskspace, and the installer didn't
bother telling me. 

Anyway, thanks all, problem solved. Tho I don't see any difference in
game..
