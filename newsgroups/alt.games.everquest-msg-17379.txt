Trust Lokari on that.  See his site for details as to why I say that!

Add 5% to 15% per attempt that may fail, and you your failure rate for that
particular part, and that is if it is trivial and you have good stats.
Without the trivial and stats, you can add up to 100% just to cover the
failures.  So someone selling for 40pp may not be making one thin copper.

I know people who regularly triple the price on selling jewelry items.
Their reasoning is simple.  There are 10 jewelry items that are NOT sellable
for every one that is.  They want to pay for the trivials on all that stuff
they had to make to learn up to the skill they are at.

The ratio on sellable to non-sellable on Taylor does not seem quite as
harsh.  Also you can make more profit selling the smaller items to vendors
than you can with Jewelry.  That adds up to covering the trivials by doing
something like doubling the price.

So the main problem is TIME.  How many PP is your time worth?  If you hunt
down the pelts, silks, or whatever how much can you reasonable charge?  A
Back Pack goes for 100pp.  And that is reasonable compared to the time it
would take to get the pelt to make it.

Seems to me that 30pp to 40pp just to cover the cost and trivials could
quickly become 60pp to 120pp to cover the time and trouble.  I would really
have to do more with the skill myself to get a better idea.  I am basing my
estimates on second hand information, and just how much time and trouble it
took me to get 176 Jeweler.

If people come to me with the vials, and the gems, how much I charge to cast
the spells depends on how busy I am.  If I am doing nothing, and don't
intend to be doing anything, I may just cast for you.  But if I have things
to do I'll say "10pp a casting."  The main goal is so that you won't waste
my time.  Many times I'll cast it for 1pp a shot.
