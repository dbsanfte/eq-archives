This is the one I thought you'd give me flack on... but I'd like
to see em with one pure caster class, and not the Necro that
Iksar have.  Wizard is a lame class, lets not go there... leaving
mages and enchanters.  Mages should have been able to
prevent the clearly elemental based magic that blew thier
city off the face of Norrath.  On the other hand, enchanters are
charming and enigmatic... and the wealth of illusions would help
explain why no Luclin-eer has been spotted back on the
main world since the big move... perhaps they've been among
us all along!
