We've had *some* luck getting SGs and the AC to pop by only killing these
special mobs, along with the mob in the tower (no we didn't kill him at any
certain time). The problem with most AC theories is that there are usually
2-3 group (or soloist) in the zone testing out their theory. So any testing
of your theory is tainted by the others testing out their theories. The best
theory I've seen in action is "get 10 people in zone and kill everything" I
*know* that has to help because the AC obviously is not a timed spawn since
he will sometimes pop one after another, and killing everything in the zone
assures that *whatever* is holding the ACs place is dead.

Here's how our *some* luck worked. We arrived in SRO, tracked the "special"
mobs (basically any mob you don't see two of in track or ones with slightly
different names "a drybone skeltone" is different from "drybones skeleton"
"a sand mummy" is different from the other normally mummies, etc). Doing
this got us 2 AC pops in 30 minutes.
