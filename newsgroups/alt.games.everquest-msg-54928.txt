The encouragement was in the observation that the events are varying
levels and happening in multiple zones. In other words, anyone who
wants to participate can get there and do so.

Why wouldn't he? The vast majority of events have been GM-run. Your
statement that you've been "zones away from an event" indicates that
you're talking about discrete, one-time events.

So? As Ray said, this is a different kind of event. Now you'll
probably be cross at me for saying it, too.

In a conventional event, you'd be right. But it's not a conventional
event, and you're wrong.

These events are on-going. I was in both Rathe Mountains and East
Karana today (Nov 1, noonish), and the events are *still* under way.
The one in WC I hung around long enough to discover that it lasts as
long as an hour, and runs every three hours. North Ro is apparently
having them, too, as no doubt some other zones are.

In other words, anyone in the game who wants to can easily get there
and play. Those who would rather sit an feel sorry for themselves, of
course, are welcome to do that instead.
