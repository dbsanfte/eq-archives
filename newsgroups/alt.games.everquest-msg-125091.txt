Yeah, I know for sure.  I posted my logs about 2-3 weeks ago which
showed that my delay was well below 10, in fact it was below 9 with my
11/18 primary hand weapon.  (My primary hand effective delay is 8
while raiding, under 9 self-buffed, and these logs were before I got
the upgraded overhaste--110%vs125% haste total).
I will state for the record that my own logs show that there is no
delay floor at 10.  If there is such a minimum delay, it is below 8.
Hmmm, even as a bard, with no double attack, a pre-nerf moss-covered
twig would make me a machine.
