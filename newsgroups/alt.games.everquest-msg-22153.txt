My druid always has *coat on him if he has any possibility of being hit.
He's been using it for over 2 years.

That being said I looked at the stats at the beginning, found it pretty much
a joke, thought I remembered an ATK increase.  So I'm wrong. :)  I always
cast it on myself if I figured I might be hit, but only because it lasts so
long.  Now I'll start wearing it more often.

I was going to guess that the AC provided sucked because Bulwark of Faith
(the last cleric AC-only buff at level 55) only gave a crappy 38 AC but
comparatively speaking, *coat is a GOOD AC buff.  Thorncoat, level 49 gives
32.

Eh, learn something new every day.
