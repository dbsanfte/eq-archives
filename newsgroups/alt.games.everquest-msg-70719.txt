   Yep.  And the monk is probably not going to
be doing much, since I found I was missing my
old Drinal stomping grounds too much.

   You sound like me, sorta.  I get awful cases
of class envy...I want one of everything, really.
If verant would give us 16 character slots per 
server I would use 15, have to leave on open for
temp characters in case I need to check something
out or do a transfer in a newbie city that I've
got no one near.
    But I'm starting to settle down...except for
Teaclaw, I think I probably will be keeping this
line-up for a while.  Won't know about Teaclaw till
(if) I get her up to 9 or 10.
