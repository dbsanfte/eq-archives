Just curious - why would the air pet effect the rogue's ability to get good
backstab position?  I'm thinking the air pet stuns might actually give the
rogue an opportunity to get into backstab position and execute while the mob
stands  still while stunned.   I'm doubtful of it because I don't think the
stun is long enough, but I wouldn't think the air pet stun would negatively
impact the rogue's ability to backstab.  One a side note, you don't need to
worry about researching level 44 pets because you can buy them all in Katta
Castellum.  In fact, I think you can buy the 39 water pet there.

The very few times I've had a rogue in the group, we've also had a knight to
keep aggro.  I agree the rogue's evade will probably not make the mob turn
toward the pet so that the rogue can backstab.  Perhaps you could use the
earth pet to keep the mob rooted.  When the rogue wants to BS, she takes a
couple of steps back so that earth pet is closest to mob, mob turns on earth
pet and rogue sneaks in real quick to do a backstab before the mob turns on
her again.  I don't think it will work, but it's the best suggestion I have.
