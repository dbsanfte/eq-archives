Unfortunately, level 3 anything, unless twinked, etc., is strapped for cash.
The only thing I can offer of note is that at about lvl 10 or so, I went to
the bandit camp in the Karanas (shit, can't recall now which one it was...)
and made a *ton* of $$ by killing the bandits and turning in their sashes
(in Queynos, maybe? someone please correct me if I'm wrong, and I almost
certainly am!) They also, if memory serves me, drop bronze weapons which are
worth quite a bit when you sell them. The biggest problem is keeping them
all from aggroing on you (usually they're in a clump on the shore of a lake,
maybe 5-7 of them), so you'll have to either have a higher level friend who
can "lull, mes, or harmony", or have it yourself before you go there... and
that's been so long ago for my druid that I don't *even* remember. After
that, (lvl 12-14) WCommons offers wisps, which are good for plat if you can
find a few that have Greater Lightstones (about 3pp), or regular Lightstones
(about 8gp).

Darklet, druid of *almost* 18 seasons

Thanks for playing.
