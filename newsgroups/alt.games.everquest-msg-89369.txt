That Legends doesn't draw resources from non-legends servers, like they
stated it wouldn't.

I could probably cite if you're desperate for a specific quote from VI
stating that, but I would expect a full grovelling appology if I'm made
to go to the effort ):oP

Or are you saying they have employed a full programming team to work on
Legends content, as well as the extra CS staff they have taken on?

The 'issue' is manpower being taken off work on existing servers, and
diverted to the l33t server. Something they specifically claimed
wouldn't happen. Designing, programming, and building a whole new zone
with mobs, landscape and content, is a considerably more work than
simply adding someone's name to an item
