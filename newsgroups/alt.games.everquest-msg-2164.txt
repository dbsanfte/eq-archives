Just a story to relay. My friends and I went to hunt EE for the optic
fibers for my
warrior's crafted armor. Well Cerikk (20-25bard), Brunder
(20-25shadowknight)
and my warrior Reeleb(20-25warrior) were all doing fine. We were in the
Karanas
by the way to HH and camping the EE that pops in that zone. [The mino maze

was camped] and we started fighting. I got charmed and started whacking
away on
the bard..he had his running song and managed to outrun me when I got
stuck
behind a tree. The evil eye was blue and I had over a 70MR at the time. It
was fun
because we all lived, but had he died or the tree not been there it would
have been
different. The EE seems to go after the person that is doing the most
damage [at least
in my experience] They were not too tough though, besides a little
excitement never
hurt anybody 8-)
