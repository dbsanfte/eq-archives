As follow up to that; I took my cleric on a pick up Nagafen raid the 
other day. My "job" was to float over the lava well out of the fray, and 
monitor a couple red bars, preventing them from dropping too low. I 
accomplished this by selecting one of 4 icons based on the rate they 
were dropping, all the while keeping an eye on a steadily decreasing 
blue bar.

Sound familiar to anyone? More than a little in common with the new 
tradeskill interface wouldn't you say?

And that was the 'good part', the 'culmination' of the previous 5 hours 
of waiting, recruiting players, prepping, clearing, finding the one guy 
who got horribly lost, etc was all so I could do what I just described 
above.

I think the new tradeskill system will do just fine. There will be no 
shortage of people willing to play that game. There is no shortage of 
people already playing that game.
