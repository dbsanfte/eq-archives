Just wondering if anybody had heard of a change in the spawing
information on this guy, and his trigger. (Something Deepwater. She
spawns out in Burnt Woods, wherever it is this week.) We set up a raid
for one of our clerics on old Ixiblat yesterday. Got the whole raid
force assembled, and at six p.m. game time, sent out the rangers to
track Deepwater down. No show. Everyone waited around until the buffs
started wearing off. We thought maybe she was broken or something. Then,
at Six _A.M._ she spawns. The cleric did the turn in, we pulled Ix and
killed him easy enough. (Three deaths... chanter Tashicide and two
overeager nukers) But all the screen captures I'd seen on this mob show
him being killed at night. Ours were clearly in daylight.

Bug? Change in spawn time during a recent patch? Randomization of spawn
time?

Anyone else done Ix lately and noticed this, or other differences?
