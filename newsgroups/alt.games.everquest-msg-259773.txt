Rangers have no utility ?

Travelling.
Ask the Cleric moving to Barindu about SoE and Camo.
Want to meet some friends in Ssra basement with a 
Berserker? - Have fun crossing Mons Letalis without
Levitationt,take the risk of invis dropping or let the
group pull the way free in Ssra,all in all with my Ranger I save
the group a great deal of time,maybe this should go in
the dps paragraph.

What about Tracking?
Playing mostly my Cleric lately,I really miss it in Ldon,and
even see group members asking to get a Ranger for Tracking.
Last Mountain Trials I did,I was constantly asked to check
it for named.

Grouped with the "Holy Trinity",no Druid,no Shammy?
Regrowth becomes valuable.

No Mage,no Druid in group? - Damageshields.

Pulling?
Sure,indoor pullings "sucks",but outdoor,thanks to Harmony,
Rangers make fine pullers.

DPS ?
Do you really think,there are many Monks or Berserkers who
do more damage than a Ranger with a Darkglint Blade?
Last MM Raid I  was on,I remember when 6 Rangers turned on TS
at the same time,suddenly you could see the hps of MM begin
to drop,sure its anecdotal.


Problem lies not in Rangers underpowered,its that other classes
are severely overpowered,like Bards,Enchanters and Beastlords,
who all get buffs which benefit both,casters AND melees,especially
Beastlords,I wonder do they really need a mana regeneration buff?
