    Some were assholes. Some were just doing what anyone that could flatten
a mob that drops 60 K pp items would do - kill them every chance they got.
Enough of them caused customer morale headaches that it got changed.

    The raiding thing always troubled me a bit. Low-end guilds weren't
learning how to kill stuff if they brought their manaburn wizards along.
They were instead using the wizards to blow stuff almost dead, then
finishing the job. That really puts you in a hole if you want to raid beyond
those 32 K mobs, because you haven't picked up any raid habits other than
"attack and let the guys with pointy hats blow it up". And to get manaburn
didn't require raid-level gear, just XP time - so people were never picking
up the appropriate skills to advance to tougher stuff. Well, guess it won't
be a problem now!
