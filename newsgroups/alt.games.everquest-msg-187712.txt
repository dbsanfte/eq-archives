    Siren's Grotto was a well-known problem. It's not that there's a safe
point down there, but more that the entire underwater tunnel where Fellspine
spawns was buggy. Most of the mob models couldn't move down there, so you'd
get danger-free kills. And GMs knew about it, but it's hard to suspend
someone when they'd have to run up to the mob and stay in melee range ON
PURPOSE to try and get hit by it.

    One of the bard sites had a guide to getting the 30-odd percent haste
belt that drops down there. It was pretty easy. ;-)
