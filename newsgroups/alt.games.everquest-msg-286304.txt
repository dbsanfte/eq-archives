Feeling my oats, I decided to make a run to Katta Castelum to pick up 
some Combine instruments tonight before I log out.  Admittedly, knowing 
that A) I have to die each night I play anyway, and B) I can summon my 
body to the Guild Lobby for peanuts adds to my bravery

But its a scary trip, and I'd like to succede.

Among my gear there was a potion of invisibility, reward for one of the 
tutorial quests.  Its insta cast like the others I've tried so far.

On a hunch, I started singing selos only, then clicked the invis potion. 
  Sure enough it did not interrupt my song, and since I wasn't starting 
a new song, my singing didn't break the invis!

Naturally its worn off while I type this, but then again the sonic 
wolves in TM see invis anyway.

Here I go.

The hills on this run are killing me, moving at bardspeed with no safe fall.

Well that was fun, actually didn't take any fall damage here, but ate a 
bunch in Hollowshade and Grimling Forest

Combine instruments are all 2 points better than the basic ones sold in 
GFay et al.  Expensive though, up to 65pp each.  Just for fun, I buy a 
spare of each to sell in the bazaar, we'll see if people will pay not to 
make that run, or maybe don't know where the instruments are found.

Now for the run back. Combine hand drum isn't feeling noticably faster 
on selos, but it does give me a boost to my chant.  I take some damage 
again on hills in GF, try the strings out, bah, no change, 4 hp regen a 
sec with them or with the regular lute.  Back in Shadeweaver, I fire up 
COD on some Nuisances... 8 damage a tic just like before.  Seems like a 
wasted trip perhaps, or maybe it will be a small improvement when the 
numbers get bigger.

Time to go die.

Songberg, 10 bard, Combine
