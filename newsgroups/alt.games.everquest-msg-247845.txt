With spawned mobs, i.e. you have to kill x to get y to appear, the one 
who kills x should have first shot at y.

In the above thread, I was under the impression that the targets were up 
all the time with very fast respawn times.  As such, I feel that it 
should be first come, first serve.  Sony's official rules, as quoted 
earlier, say that this is the case.

One day, hunting in one of the areas off my character's home zone 
someone asked me to leave, claiming he was there first.  I thought about 
it, almost told him that this was my area, I'd been there for several 
hours and if he couldn't play nice and share he could hunt elsewhere.  I 
didn't.  I didn't steal his kill, I'd targeted something while he was 
sitting in his rump medding.  I just followed my usual hunting pattern, 
moving along the shore taking out targets as I moved.  Incidentally, I 
know I was there first because I'd used the /who command about 10-15 
minutes earlier, the only other characters were high level, 60-65.

Another day, I saw a character in paludal cavern hunting the three 
shrooms in a cave that I prefered.  I watched for a few moments then 
sent a tell asking him if he had any objections.  He said he didn't mind 
sharing.  We leapfrogged shrooms for a while then went our separate ways.

As far as kill/stealing goes, I've done it with one kill.  I was trying 
a new spell and didn't wait long enough to realize that my target was 
wounded.  I apologized, the other character basically said accidents 
happen, I went to another zone with no hard feelings on his part.

My point is that the game is a community one.  Like in real life there 
are official rules, if you do this you get your hand slapped 
(figuratively) if you are caught.  In an ideal society if you break the 
law, you get caught, you get convincted, you serve jail time, community 
service time, pay a fine or some combination of the above.  And like in 
real life there are unofficial rules that don't have official 
consequences but do make life easier for everyone.

Unofficial rules are learned by observation.  In the game, I watch.  I 
listen.  I lurk in this newsgroup.  I try to be curteous.  I try to act 
the way I want others to act.  I try to act honorably as honor is 
defined within the game.  And, if there is a target I want I go after it 
if I have the firepower to do so and do not feel that I am interfering 
with another by doing so.

Some people are jerks.  I don't think the group in the original post did 
anything wrong.  If it was wrong to go in and take out targets that were 
not engaged by the original poster, as he seems to feel, they were 
probably not aware of this, assuming it was against the unofficial rules 
of the game.  He chose to break the official rules, deliberately and 
consciously in retaliation.  He then compounded this offense by comming 
here and complaining about their actions and, judging from his responses 
to the responses he recieved here, wanting validation for his actions.

The actions of the original poster were juvinile at best and criminal, 
at least as defined by the official rules of EverQuest, at worst.  My 
advice, which I fully expect him to ignore, is grow up.
