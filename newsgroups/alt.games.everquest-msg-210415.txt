Subject: Having Trouble getting onto EQOA?

  I have been playing EQOA on my ps2 for the past 3 months.  All of a sudden, I
can't access any of my characters higher than level 6.  When I select a
character it goes to the "entering game world screen", but then it freezes. 
After about 45 seconds, I get an error screen, "server unavailable (6)."  Funny
thing is, I can access any new characters I make until about level 6, then they
do the same thing.  I called support twice.  They said something about having
problems with aol connections with characters that aren't new.  Anyone else
have this problem?  Does any know what's going on?  I haven't been able to
access my characters for almost 3 weeks now.  If it's not fixed soon, I'm
dropping my subscription and waiting for FFXI.
