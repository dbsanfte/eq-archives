Wow.

That's a 100hp/tick increase, IE a 20% increase.

SE: 2400hp (it lasts 4 ticks) / 400 = 6/1 hp/m ratio
Old SE: 2000 / 400 = 5/1 hp/m
CH: 10000 / 400 = 25/1
SR: 1450 / 400 = 3.6/1 

Nice upgrade, SOE, especially given that I use this cele for topoffs 
between pulls and healing casters that got hit but aren't under fire right-
this-second :)
