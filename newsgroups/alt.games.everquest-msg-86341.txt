	All procs fire off the primary hand's swings, even if the effect is on an
off-hand weapon.

	This might cause some anomalies if Verant's people didn't code it properly
(hahahaaha...stop, I'm killing myself....)  Proc rates on weapons are adjusted
according to the delay, in order to produce the desired number of
procs/minute.  Slower weapons will usually have a higher proc rate to
compensate for the high delay...but if you put them into the off-hand, and
equip a faster weapon in the primary hand....
