Ok, let's phrase that differently. You'll get the benefit of the pet's
normal delay if the weapon has a greater delay than the pet's. (e.g. if
the pet's delay is 30, and you give it a 29/50 weapon, it will weild it
as if it were a 29/30 weapon.)  Of course, given the nerf, the converse
would be that if you give the pet a 3/17 piercer, it will weild it as a
3/30 taking away that advantage.
