Well, as for Chimp and Gimp I have been on a few alts lately mainly because
things were getting a bit dull and they were actually managing to stay alive
with alarming regularity. It was getting so monotonous that Gimp was even
starting to enquire if he had been Ebayed again but picked up by someone
competent this time around.

I have started a Ranger just lately, that should be enough to fill my dark
humour quota of ridiculous deaths. I have yet to see if it has the same feel
to it though, getting a Ranger killed repeatedly just doesn't seem to have
the same sense of challenge to it....
