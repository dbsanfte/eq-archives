I'm sure it comes from all age groups, but I can say that I hear that sort 
of exchange all the time from Xbox live when my kids are playing it. The 
people there (my kids included on some occasions, at which point I remind 
them what tools they're being) berate and antagonize complete strangers 
incessantly, but end up seeking those same people out to play with them 
later. It's not even good-natured ribbing, but simple disrespectful 
silliness. It really is a strange mentality. Sadly, that approach to online 
gaming is becoming more and more prevalent.

My kingdom for a MMORPG for the mature gamer. Here's hoping Vanguard can 
take a step back in that direction.
