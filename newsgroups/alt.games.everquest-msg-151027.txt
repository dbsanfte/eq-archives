hmm.. grats?  it does look badass though :)  guess you can be the centre of
attention at weddings or something.

Oh yeah love that!  Patch day, prepare for a mob (something that involves
lots of fighting to get to, or a lengthy coh etc is always good).. then the
"all servers coming down for a 10minute patch!"  30 mins later its back up,
and of course no mob.

Hehe there was a tit for tat run for gylphed cycle recently.. each one
killing a single TM to stop the other guild triggering it...  fun huh?

Ssra crashed last night on Prexus, btw.

They actually told you to petition in-game?
GM_Admin-noob, "sorry I can't do world kicks from in the chat room"
Guide_Dweeb, "sorry. we do not do world kicks.  reboot your computer and the
problem will resolve in 15 minutes"

Doesnt seem so..  100hp bp's with 39% haste... 39?  wtf?  why not just make
it 41 and its end-game?   Damage 3 mask is just something that drops
elsewhere too.. quests seem long winded, maybe doze equivalents (ie end game
rewards)

2 of the warders are as hard as the hardest nToV mobs (think zlex (if im
thinking of the right one.. the one with the really nasty dot, and vyemm)
so only the top few guilds are going to be able to clear the place, on
prexus at least.

1 thing about new ST... the mobs repop fast, and are faster than SoW.  If
you wipe and don't get a cleric camped, your in for 1 very shitty C.R (hope
ur rez stick monks are online and can flop all the way down)
