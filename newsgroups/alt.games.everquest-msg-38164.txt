my lvl 18 ogre warrior seems to fall into the levels that stonebrunt
mountains were made for. i've just read that it's another non-bindable
melee zone. 
anyone hunting there tell me if it's worth the trip, and how dangerous
it is for a rallos zek worshiping ogre to get bound near it? i'm not
even sure where the nearest bind spot for melee is.
