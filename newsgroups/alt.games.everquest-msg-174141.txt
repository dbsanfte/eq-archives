Hello All;

I've just started playing EQ and loving it so far.  However, I need to ask a
techie question:

I have just the original, Classic EQ.  A noobie friend of mine, just got the
game, bought the Gold Addition.  When we play together, we are on the phone
so we can group and keep up with things. Everytime I cast a spell I can hear
a neat spell sound over the phone, from my friends speakers, however, I
don't hear anything coming from my computer. In options, I have the 2 sound
sliders all the way up, and music slider turned all the way down. I've tried
turning up the music slider but still do not hear spell sounds. I appear to
be able to hear  the other sounds, i.e., wind, water, walking sounds,
monster sounds, etc.

 ALSO, I do NOT hear the sound when I level up, I can hear my friends sound
over the phone when he levels up. Are these missing sounds due to my friend
buying the whole game, expansions and all, and I only have the Classic??

My system:

AMD 2000xp, 512meg, Windows XP(home ed), clean install, fully patched
(except SP1).  SoundBlaster Live. Geforce 3. No overclocking. No other
problems with anything.

Thanks to any who answer, for your time and expertise.

Brokerzoid. Level 12 Barb, Shamen
