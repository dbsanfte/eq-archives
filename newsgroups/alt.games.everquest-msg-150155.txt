Any mob level 55 or higher will have a 30 minute corpse

You can stay on the corpse about 3 and half mins, when you leave it you can
get back on it instantly.

The bigger the guild, the better the loot that rots.  E.g in kael, King
Tormax axe has been unwanted for several months now.  Sometimes it rots,
sometimes somebody in the zone gets lucky.

Things like Lord Yelinaks whip.. nobody exps in SS really, so its just a
"/who all ranger 50 60, /tell ranger come to SS asap plz"

Cloak of the falling stars is rotting now for us (another kael mob) other
loots that we have no need for but keep are the droppables, such as Reavers,
Swiftblades (sell them for the guild bank)

Our guild bank has about 1million pp in it, I know we took a big hit when we
kitted out our warriors in the heraldic(sp?) stuff, spent a few hundred
thousend on that.. but were always getting unwanted loots to sell for guild
profit.  pp on mobs doesnt really make a difference.. I know at lower level
it generally goes to a specific person, for us though we don't care.

And while 1mil might sound an awful lot, we probably spend 50k+ every week
just on dots, things like spells, tears, rare loots make sure the bank gets
hammered from time to time

Im an officer in my guild, were a pretty major raiding guild (if mobs are up
we will raid 7 days a week).

Handling loot is by far the shittiest job an officer has to deal with, its
the part of the job that I HATE
