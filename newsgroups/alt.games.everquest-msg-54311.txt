I was in Wakening Lands a couple of days ago and got some tasty candy from a
GM looking like a dragon called "The Treater" kinda cute, he hugged me,
danced with me, smiled at me.. I thought it was a nice change.. and for the
GM's who probably get crapped on a lot a pleasant change of pace from the
tedium their jobs offer.

Also the same night and interesting development in the same zone where a
mechanical dragon who conned indifferent (I am not on CoV faction) to me
showed up and blipped, beeped and screeched his way looking for his
creator... Sprocket the Dragon summoned me, and I tried a few things
(including trying to give him some of the tasty treats given to me earlier
by The Treater) but then had to gate as a nasty was chasing me down.  This
occured on Zebuxoruk... cool dragon, got a nice screencap of it.

I think VI is running scared at DAoC.  Between AO in the summer and DAoC
now, I have lost many friends, seen entire guilds lose their rosters, and
seen the EQ economy go down the toilet with the real life one, hehe.  My
guess is more GM events to give EQ a bit more flavor is the best thing they
can come up with to counteract a weak questing engine built into the game
and the lack of any real story that EQ offers as opposed to the relatively
strong AO engine.

The next thing they should do is review their customer service policies.
With the amount of competition that EQ is receiving now, a friendlier, more
helpful Senior GM staff would be in order... Number of frivolous petitions
by me 0 --- Number of times a GM has actually helped out 0 (Out of 3
petitions).  Anarchy Online has definitely a much better policy... make the
customer happy and the customer will come back.. I actually left EQ for a
month until a friend begged me to come back because AO was a friendlier
environment to play in (No KSing, friendly GMs, better questing, a story to
bite into, a raison d'etre)
