Ill ante up my 2 cents.

Yes its fun. Alot of fun. 

> Worth checking out?

Yes. Its extremely polished. The launch was very smooth - and I
personally havent run into many bugs, just a few minor ones - nothing
big.

At my point (8th level Tanker) not nearly as complex which is good and
bad.

Good because its easy to jump into quickly and start bashing heads.
The learning curve is extremely simple. You start off rather powerful
(as opposed to having your butt handed to you by newbie petting zoo
fodder in eq when you are level 1)

Bad because I can see the possibility of the game getting old quickly.
The missions are somewhat generic with little variety. You'll see the
same type of instanced zones over and over and many of the zones are
very similar in look and feel (again - at least up to the point Ive
played). Theres no loot - again which is bad and good. There wont be
squabbles over who gets what - and no camping really. There is some
kill stealing, although usually its no big deal because even when
theres alot of heroes around, you can just go a block up and theres
plenty more bad guys to smack. Just sometimes if you are doing a kill
X mission, it can get frustrating when you engage a group of what you
are seeking and some blaster comes along and nukes the entire group.
But again - it really hasnt been a big issue.

Will it take you away from EQ? For a short time maybe, but I question
the long term holding power of the game. It all depends on what the
devs do. If they continue adding content to the game, then it may have
some longer term value.

You say you've burned alot of money on MMORG's lately, and I will say
this: No other MMORG (besides EQ) has held me like this and Ive tried
many of them. I didnt care for SWG, Horizons, Earth & beyond and
several others. COH has my attention now.
