"Congrats Sneezi on Khalshazar, Kraiven on Vengeful Mail of the Void, and
Neokhan on Wistful Tunic of the Void. Get your Magelo profiles linked to the
members section so everyone can see how uber y'all are now ;)

Ssragate Temple offered us more temptation in the form of Xerkizh the
Creator, so we held a business lunch in his chambers, and he learned just
how cutthroat we are. Congrats to Osirion on Hategiver, Pull on Headband of
Many Visions, and Kora on Soft Scale Slippers.

Deciding that we'd had our fill of snakes, we made a quick trip to our old
base of operations, Kael Drakkel. Intelligence Reports indicated that our
old buddy the Avatar of War was back in town. Since we still have a karmic
debt to repay that should last well into 2003, he had to die. Congrats Fiall
on Blade of Carnage, Calgon and Doji on Flayed Barbarian Hide Masks!

And finally, we took a small detour to The Deep to drop everyones favorite
Mr. Hanky wannabe, the Burrower Parasite. Congrats Janistin on Bile Drenched
Flesh Robe, Snacko on Shard from Unfathomable Depths, and Xuleika on Ancient
Burrower Spine"

No mention of Cocks, Cock suckers, Cock Sizes, Verant Sux0rs, we r0x0rs or
anything? You guys just aren't really uber, are you ;ï¿½)
