You're probably right, but I can fantasize about there being
relevance, can't I?

Oh geeze, don't bother. Take note of good names instead - you'll save
a lot of time.

Is there even a name policy at DAoC? I seem to recall seeing one, but
I'm not sure where. My response so far, to the few people who've asked
me for anything ('Have you seen my tombstone around here?' or 'Where
is the town I'm looking for?') has been "Sorry, I don't help people
with stupid names." It has been oddly satisfying.
