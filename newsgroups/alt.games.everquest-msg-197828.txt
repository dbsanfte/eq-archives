99 times out of 100 the problem is totally beyond your control. Any
packet loss or latency problems will occur outside of your
home/apt/etc. The most you can do is reboot (PC or cable modem or
router all all of the above), and if that doesn't solve it you are
screwed until the problem is fixed elsewhere. There really is no point
in having the numbers.
