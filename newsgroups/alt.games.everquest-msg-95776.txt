While trying to target or con other targets, I sometimes con
my horse by accident (it's easy to do, that damned horse
head fills a lot of the forward view).

My horse has conned amiable to me, indifferent to me,
and apprehensive to me -- all within the same five
minutes in the same zone...

Sometimes the horse "buff" icon disappears while I'm
still riding the horse.  When it does, I can /dismount
and see myself standing beside my riderless horse
(that's not supposed to happen, period.)
I can run around, and sometimes my horse runs after
me, sometimes it just stands still.  On other people's
screens, I'm still riding.  For all practical purposes,
I'm no longer on a horse (have to sit to meditate,
run at normal speed, etc.), but if I try to cast a
fresh horse to ride I get "you are already on a horse".
Trying another /dismount, however, tells me I don't
have a horse.  Sigh.

Spells which are supposed to turn you towards a 
certain direction or object (e.g. Locate Corpse,
Sense Undead, True North, etc.) simply do not work
if you're riding a horse, and have never worked on
a horse.  I /bug this after every patch, but not
only is it not fixed yet (2.5 months and counting),
but they have yet to even acknowledge it as a bug.

If you have Levitate cast on you while on a horse,
it now works (it didn't used to).  But if you dismount,
then cast a fresh horse, you are no longer levitating,
even though the levitate icon is still up and you're
still levitating any time you drop the horse.

Autofollowing while riding a horse still often crashes
to the desktop, especially if you try sending a message
while autofollowing.

People often have a hard time buffing you
if you're on a horse ("Your target is too far away"),
and initiating a trade with you while on a horse often
fails.

And the saga continues.
