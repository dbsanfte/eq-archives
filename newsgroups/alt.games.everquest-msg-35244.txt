It would indeed be a miracle. KeG took out the first warder in an epicly
long 11 hour raid on Saturday night. It'll be a few weeks before they
kill all 4. That is of course, assuming we (DH) don't take them down
first, given that we clear ST and 3 warders in as little as 3 hours.

Given the situation on other servers, no guild will be killing all 4
warders until they feel someone else may beat them to it. Awakening the
Sleeper is apparently a 'one shot' deal.
