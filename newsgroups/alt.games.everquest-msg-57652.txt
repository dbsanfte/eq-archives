My warrior is only 31 but I do enjoy playing him, so stick at it.  I also found 
what you find and sometimes its difficult.

I was in Oasis until 20 , pulling orcs from the orc highway, then I went to 
Ogre Island and did them (not Oowump or whatever its called) , HH Pass is cool 
, I got 30 iin the basement there, LOIO is also good.  I group with a Palladin 
friend of mine.

Learn how to pull well and organise the group , people seem to like that and 
you get a reputation for a good puller (hehe)

Best of luck.


PS I did go to the Gargoyles at one point but it was slow I found and not many 
eyes (they sell for 9p or so each)
