    In the defense of the monks: in outdoor zones, mob HPs don't update
until you get close to them. You also frequently cannot see people at
different elevations than yourself, and a lot of raid guild players forget
to turn on spell effects when they camp to alts. Net result: monk alt
doesn't see your spell effects, doesn't see you, and sees an undamaged mob
moving at walking speed with nobody on it.

    Now, what should clue them in is (a) when they tag the mob and it's HPs
drop down a fair chunk more than what they did, and (b) when they get level
with the mob and can see you. But as you found out with that last fellow,
not everyone has the requisite clue. ;-)
