Maybe its an indication of the ultimate in EQ "immersion", but I was
thinking "where would I want to live in Norrath?".

Kaladim with its flowing ales? Qeynos/Freeport with their life of
debauchery? The green pastures of the Karanas?

My mind kept going back to HHK - maybe its intimacy, highest ratio of
inns/sq mile, the allure of danger but knowing that guard is closeby if
needed.

Thoughts?
