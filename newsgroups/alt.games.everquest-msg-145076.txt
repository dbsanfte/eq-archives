First, I know what you're *trying* to say, I think, and that ain't
it. ;)   But I'm sure you'll correct me if I'm wrong...

"There was never meant to be a great rift between church and state.
The idea was never to keep religion out of the state's business,
rather to keep the state and churches out of each other's."

There's a major difference between "church," especially when you
use "the church," and religion, IMO.  And it's certain that the
Founding Fathers never thought that religious views or philosophy
wouldn't have an impact on the state.  But it's equally certain
that they didn't want the intermingling of *church* and state
either.
