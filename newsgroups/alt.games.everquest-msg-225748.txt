I only bring this up because a friend of mine wasn't aware of it; I
thought most people were. If you ever have trouble getting money back
from someone has billed your charge card in error, simply call them and
mention having your credit card company charge it back. My friend was
billed twice for a billing period in Anarchy Online and dispite being
assured twice by their customer support people that it would be fixed up
and the money refunded, it had been 6 months when he mentioned it to me.
I had him try the threatened charge back method and he got the money
credited to his card a week later. Companies that bill via credit card
absolutely hate having chargebacks, because if they get enough, the
credit card company will raise the cost of using their credit cards.
Unfortunately, it seems many people don't even know they can do
chargebacks through their credit card company so many companies will be
lax in coughing up mischarged money.
