this happened to me on my most recent tanking class (sk)

what i did was i fought several mobs at once ...it seems to make defense
rise faster

i'm also under the impression that more mobs is better than one mob that
hits a lot

also, red mobs will raise your defense faster, but make sure you have some
way of dealing with them

overall though, i wouldn't worry to much about it....defense will go
up...you're a tank, after all =)
