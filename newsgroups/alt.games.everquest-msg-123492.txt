Spell research (check out http://eq.castersrealm.com/ ). "Words" are
used in necromancer and magician research. "Pages" are used for
Enchanter research. The "stones" (which are called "runes") are for
wizards.

There will be many spells after level 16 or so that can only be
obtained through research. The skill is a major pain in the butt.
Gotta find the right words (uncommon-end common drops with a long list
of possible words, runes, and pages that the mob can drop) for the
spell and pray you don't fail the combines. Whoever thought of the
concept was pretty sadistic. ><
