Its a reference to a 'flag' in computing theory, which is a single 
bit... which can be 'on' or 'off'. (eg the 'overflow flag' for 
mathematical operations).

Applied to EQ it refers to a status condition that your character 
performs the required action to switch.

For example... you need to perform a specific event to earn the right to 
go to the plane of such n such.

When you perform the event the server makes a note of it on your 
chracter record. (e.g. some bit gets flipped... and your character is 
now 'flagged' so when you try to go to the plane of such n such it will 
see that the bit is on and let you go.
