Actually, the one in OOT in particular, had a tendency to kill sharks in the
water.  You could usually find him in the water just off the dock.  If you
are low level, this could be bad, as the shark might eat you before you have
a chance to ask for the port.  I would recommend getting it typed in ready
to say before hopping in to target the translocator.  I heard they are gone
now anyway, in which case, the advice is moot.
