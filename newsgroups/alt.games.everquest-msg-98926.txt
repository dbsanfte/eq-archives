Yeah I got it, got RoK and SoV (for when I hit vl 30-35, and the fact it
changed the UI.).
I know RoK and SoL gave zones, spells, etc to all lvls, but my point was
people like Jeremiah thinks only high lvl players should get new zones, exp
paks, and other stuff.  Yet even tho they have tons of zones from the old
world, RoK, SoV and SoL they want more.  But if a low-mid lvl wants more
things it's wrong cause we got new stuff in RoK or SoL even tho they did
too.  As I said in a post most high lvl players such as Jeremiah thinks EQ
is only for them and that they are gods and to screw the low-mid lvls, cause
we're only stupid trolls.  But if they were low-mid lvl (again) they might
see what I mean.  Well not all highlvl players are like this most that I've
seen in game and lately a bit in this newsgroup are.
They say they want more zones but yet how many do they have as of now?  I
don't have anything against them getting new zones, just saying why keep
giving them zone after zone when they already have tons.  As I said I'm
called a whiner if I say i'd like more stuff, not just zones, but weapons,
armor, spells, BUT a high lvl players whines, cries and bitch about there
not being enough high lvl zones it's ok and they're not whiners, it's cause
they should get this new stuff cause their gods.
