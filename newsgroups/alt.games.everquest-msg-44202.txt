LOIO is generally a place for twinks in my oppinion. if your a meele class
its hard to get in a group iwthout being inspected to see if you have uber
weapins and armour. If you want to group a druid is basically the least
wanted class in groups at later lvls, im sad to say this but its really the
truth. Druids are great outside, but inside they generally dont bring much
to the group if its a place where you dont NEED an evacer. If you want a
class thats really group friendly, make a:

Cleric
Chanter
Warrior
Rogue
monk


These classes are those that gets groups the easyest. This is offcourse in
dungeons, outside its another story. But as you get higher lvls youwill
spent more and more time in dungeouns, so it might be wise to think ahead.
Im not saying at all thatdruids are a bad class, just that if your main
concern is that you wonna interact with other ppl and group then it might
not be the best choice especially not at higher lvls.
