Not cheaper, more mana efficient.  Big difference.  Remedy is not
mana efficient, its fast fast fast, and as I've found to my delight, long
range too.

Divine light is expensive in that it costs a lot of mana
to cast, though not as much as CHeal, or ER.  Nonetheless, its
less efficient than CE or (usually) CHeal, slower than ER,
and generally is the spell I least wanted to cast when it was
my BS.

Now you are looking at a spell that costs more mana to cast than
a CHeal, and is slower than ER by a long shot.  If you can
afford 10 seconds, cast the CHeal, if you can't afford the 10 seconds,
can you really afford the (what, 4.5 seconds?) and can you afford
to spend more mana than you would on a CHeal?

I'm not saying there is no conceivable use for the spell, I'm just
saying that thus far, I've never seen a situation that called for it.

Under 50... welll not under 50, when your target has under 3K hp... its
not your level thats important, its your targets HP total.  I worked
as cleric partner to a 60 paladin for a while when I was 40.  Only
CHeal mattered, the other heals I had were a joke.

But at any rate, when your targets are low in HP totals, and the best you
have are sub remedy spells anyway, CHeal is silly.  Still, at 50 (or
any level past 44) you do have an alternative; cast Celestial Healing
when you can instead of Superior (or later Divine Light).

I didn't, however, mean to say "cast remedy instead of Divine Light"
for your big heal.  Small heals are inherantly less efficient on a mana
per heal basis, I agree with you there.  Hope I've made my point
more clear, stopping before I try to repeat it another three different ways.
