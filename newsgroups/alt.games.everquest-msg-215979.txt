I think you are being overly cautious here, if you never cast a CHeal regularly
at a point under 40% MT hp.  Some mobs will do 40% hp in ten seconds (thus the
fact that you sometimes pick an even earlier point at which to start the heals),
but others will only do 10% or even 5% in that ten seconds, depending on the mob
and your tank.  Start a heal at 40%, see the mob take the tank down to 35% and
then the heal complete... well personally, next heal I'll be waiting a bit
longer.  OR more likely I'll cancel that heal and start another, and another,
and another, till I finally let one finish that actually heals 80% or more of
the MT's hp bar instead of just 65%.

Yes I agree that not letting the MT die is important, but no, I don't agree that
its so overwhelmingly important that you can screw mana considerations
completely; cleric mana is often the point around which the entire group turns,
the "weakest link" so to speak, and also the most important; we might go ahead
and pull even though the wizard is LOM, but if the healer is LOM its time to get
some back, even if everyone else is FM.  Figuring out when to start heals in any
given situation is part of the job, and the difference between a passable cleric
and a good one.  (great ones need more than this, the ability to use the rest of
their spell lines with flare but without waste or ignoring their principle
function, healing)

I and my friends have always referred to this as the chanter/cleric conspiracy.
I'll let anyone die in my group except the chanter, and the chanter will let
anyone die except the cleric; this is because an enchanter can keep the mobs on
ice while the cleric gets the rest of the party back and in a sembalance of
fighting trim; lose either one of the pair and you've wiped (of course courtesy
extends to necromancers and bards as substitute mezzers, and to paladins as
substitute rezzers... but its still Mez and Rez)
