    I do not believe one word of this!

    I would bet my left ball the haste was stacking, I dont know how old
your information is but its just plain WRONG. The only time I've ever been
hitting that fast is the TWO occasions ive had a bad and chanter/shammy
haste stacked. The symbols stack in my effects window and the effects
BLATANTLY do. We were knocking down mobs like no tomorrow, and that only
started when the bard got there.

    I've never heard of any effect that appears in the window with another
when they dont stack. Even if I had I'm 100% sure i and everyone else was
hitting faster when the bard was there.

    That was a bard in their mid 40's, in dreadlands.
