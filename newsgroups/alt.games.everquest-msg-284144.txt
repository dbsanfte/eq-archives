I'm not sure what you're disagreeing with.  Options can certainly
be used when needed.  And from the rest of your post, I gather you
realize that just because an option exists doesn't make it the best or
even good fit for a particular situation.  So, again... I'm not sure
what you're disagreeing with.

You do go on to say that, while you realize nobody is bound to
use particular options, you think they should because you deem
them to be most efficient in certain situations.

The glaring flaw is that you're inexperienced and aren't
necessarily capable of determining what is most efficient in
certain situations.  I seriously doubt that I could sit down with
another 7 year veteran and not have a conflicting opinion as to
the most efficient actions for many specific situations.  So it's
not terribly surprising to see people disagree with you, especially
when you speak in generalities.

I also have to disagree when you say that 'solo thoughts have
no place in a group.'  Thinking outside the grouping box is,
in my experience, quite productive.  I know I've experienced
quite a few DoN missions where the cleric/tank weren't quite up
to snuff.  Pulling with the wizard, and kiting while the cleric
is low on mana is generally enough to put those types of group
at the point they need to be to finish the mission.  Were I
thinking only within the realms of a typical wizard in a group,
those groups would quite probably fail.  Necros help
immensely in that particular situation by the way, and not
by feeding the cleric.  ;)

You also seem to be laboring under the misconception that
because a spell is in the game it was useful at one point.  So,
answer me one more question in regards to that.  Why was
the spell "Sense Magic" ever in the game?  That's the spell
that morphed into "True North" if you need some help getting
started.  ;)

And, here's a question who's answer may shed some light
on some people's opinion of those developers you seem
to place so much confidence in:

Why was alchemy broken for such a long time?
