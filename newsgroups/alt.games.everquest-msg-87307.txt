Actually I have always wondered why they patch all the servers including
test server at the same time. Every patch day I find myself trawling the net
looking for what else is out there....it's only a  matter of time before I
try something new and discover I actually like it a lot.

Whilst I it doesn't exactly piss me off - I always have wondered whether
there was some great technical need, as I can think of quite a few common
sense reasons why not to, apart from the basic "cut of the crack supply and
your junkies look elsewhere". Ie,

"Ok look - that patch doth sucketh verily, how about we repatch and repatch
again on this one server before steamrolling out blindly to all. Heck - we
can take turns in which server is going to get patch-patch-patched and which
ones are just going to get patched."

Somewhere in the back of my mind (in the paranoid/cynical area) I see a
beancounter hunched over rubbing his hands together: "Network traffic is our
major cost comrades, make sure all servers come down together so they don't
just swap over, and please, feel free to take your time.....No traffic is
good traffic! Muahahaha"
