I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that when you say
"interspersed posting" you are referring to what I'm doing here. i.e.
leaving in a section of the OP's text, then inserting your response,
more original text, more response, maybe some snipping... right? If so,
then in my admittedly limited little brain, that's still bottom posting.
It's making the conversation flow so that even somebody who hasn't been
following the thread could catch up, and your response is still "below"
the OP's text. If we choose to call it "interspersed posting" then I
would vote to say that intersperced posting is every bit as acceptable
as bottom posting.

If it's a quick answer, it might have been a quick question with a lot
of other bullshit included. Isn't it just as cool to only leave the
actual question being asked, snip out all the background noise, and
bottom post your answer to the question? I'd think so, but that's just
me.

True, but it drives me nuts. I participate in one newsgroup where it's
not only accepted, but *expected* that *ZERO* snipping will occur. Posts
can become miles long, with only two lines added on the end. Drives me
up a wall, but it's the convention, so I adapt. However, it's the RARE
exception and not one of the "rules of the road" of Usenet. In most
cases, I tend to think you can trim any post down to a very short bit
and add your response, unless the post is a line by line debate that
goes on a long ways, and you are answering each point individually with
intersperced posting. And those are just *going* to be long, and there's
nothing to be done about it.
