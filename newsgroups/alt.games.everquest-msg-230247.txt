Fo7 is 544 hp, Talisman of Kragg is 395, IoS is 45 stamina.  In my case, 
I am maxxed on stamina with just my Boar stamina buff, so, IoS has no 
effect at all on hp.  How many hp per stamina does even a level 65 get?  
Particularly when stamina is already fairly high.  Focus of Spirit (level 
60) is 420hp, so, I could see IoS + Kragg possibly being better, assuming 
room for the buffs, it was not in my case, even back then, and my stamina 
was nowhere near maxxed yet.  The other consideration is that Fo7, and 
Khura's Focusing are both group spells, whereas IoS, and Kragg are single 
target spells.  Very raid unfriendly for buffing purposes.  Fo7 has a 
slightly longer duration than IoS/Kragg (8 minutes base), KF is 22 
minutes longer.  Basically, unless you have lots of spare shaman lying 
around to single target buff the raid, you will go with the focus line, 
even if it is a few hp less (unlikely).
