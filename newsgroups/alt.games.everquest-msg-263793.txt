IOW, *you're* the one who likes watching the fish eat each other :p 

<Not that I can criticize...>


Oh, and I suspect that the... more divergent population in csipgr, as
opposed to the presumably(1) more insular age, was what Ross was
referring to when he characterized age as a 'small little pond.'
Their body of water may have more active 'fish,' but this one's got
more variety.

1) Based on my experience in rgfd as compared ro rfgm, and rguo as
compared to here.
