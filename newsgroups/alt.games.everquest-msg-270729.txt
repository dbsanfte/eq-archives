I've seen holidays come and go.  It really hasn't looked like this.  These
numbers really surprised me.  I expect there will be some returing after the
break, but I'm wondering if even those who have gone on to greener pastures
and found them not to be as green will actually return.

I'm beginning to wonder something else as well.  I wonder if something about
SOE releasing a game called "EverQuest 2" has broken mez on the EQplayer in
some way.  In a sense, taking away that safety net that was always there
when they tried things like CoH and decided it wasn't for them.  I wonder if
now that folks are somehow more willing to see that there are other options,
and if they'll be more likely to give things like AO, Saga of Ryzom, or even
console online play like Xbox Live a try.

In short, I wonder if EQLive has become a "That was a fun run, ready to try
something else" sort of phenomenon for those who left it for EQ2 or WoW,
even if those folks decide at some point that they don't like those games.

Like I mentioned earlier, I don't really thing EQLive is going anywhere
anytime soon.  If these numbers hold they may need to do something to
concentrate users in the next 12 months or so, though.  When you balance a
game with the effect of hamstringing classes to force grouping, you'd damn
well better make sure there are enough players around to group with.
