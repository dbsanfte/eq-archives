Have you been to the basement in Unrest? ... seems like the ghost camp
there was pretty good exp for a group of low 30s, but it's been a
while. 

One other nice dungeon for that lvl that nobody has mentioned is Split
Paw. Mobs are easier than Dalnir and once you figure out how to pull
past 'the doors' you can have the whole dungeon to yourself. Since you
have a monk to test-pull, shouldn't be too difficult.
