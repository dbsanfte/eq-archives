The wizard version (can't remember the name, but does same thing...
egress maybe?) was for sale in GFey for 4K. Our guild's highest wizard
almost bought it too, but was short on cash and nobody was close by to
give him a loan before the seller unloaded it. So I'd say you gave
somebody a very sweet, generous deal on Succor.
