In the class section, all abilities state I must have spent 12 points in the
Archetype section before I can activate anything. (level needs aside).

I will soon be putting points into the Archetype section, and I would like
to know if I have to put all 12 points into one thing, (such as all 12
points into Natural Durability), or if I can split it out and spend 12
points over all (such as 6 points into Mental Clarity and 6 points into
Natural Durability) ?

The General skills were no brainers for this necro - run 3 and Regen 3
(currently with Regen 2 and need one more point), but the Archetypes aren't
as simple. Being permitted to split will make it much nicer, as I like
having the mana regen AND the more hit points (for me to turn into mana).
Eventually, I want to put 12 points in both, but can it wait for me to get
Lifeburn, Pet Hold, Dire Charm, etc? I'd hate to get all the points to train
in one of my really cool Class things and find it won't let me because I had
to put all 12 Archetype skills into one field.

Anyone know?
