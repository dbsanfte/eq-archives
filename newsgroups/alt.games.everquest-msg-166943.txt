Hi folks,

Sorry for the OT post.  Looked at some of the Battletech NGs, and the
posting rates in most of them are somewhat anemic.

If anyone here is familiar with the Battletech universe, I just got into it
via MechWarrior 4:Mercs and am looking for suggestions as to entry points
for the novels.  Amazon's lists were pretty much non-helpful, as folks
suggested novels that were across the spectrum .. some early, some more
recent.

Any help on the novels for a complete mech newb would be greatly
appreciated. :-)

TIA
Crash
