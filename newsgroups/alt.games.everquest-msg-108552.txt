I certainly do know how to play a druid. I am one of the reasons druids got
a name for themselves in the first place :p I halfway think they nerfed dots
because of me, but then again my shaman friend was an even more obnoxious
kiter. I KNOW they nerfed the disease line of dots because of him :)

But if you wish to argue prove it. My monk in an hour and a half today
collected 5 perfect owlbear pelts. And a 135 owlbear meat. Take your druid
butt to hollowshade moor and spend an hour and half soloing owlbears. Tell
me how many pelts and meat you come up with :p Incidently this represents
300-400 owlbears and a kill rate measured in 3-4 owlbears per minute. Take a
stab at it. See how well you do.
