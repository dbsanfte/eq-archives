I own several pair, on various characters, they are nearly as useful as 
JBoots and MUCH easier to get (got one pair of JBoots for one of my 
characters, and helped a couple other people get their's, I really don't 
find them worth the effort).  On a bard they are more useful than on 
most, as bards don't have to stop running to activate them (or any other 
clicky)

Getting to the mob in Sol A who sells them can be a little tricky, as 
there are see invis mobs in the way, if the place isn't being camped out 
for exp; lull can help, but its also fairly crowded with regular mobs, 
and the corridors are twisty, so finding a spot where you can lull a see 
invis mob while not exposing yourself to the regular ones can be... dicey.

Still, that won't be as much of a concern as will getting that kind of 
cash together, working strictly on a selling to vendors basis; I can't 
go farm spiderling silks or anything like that.  I've never really had 
to farm money at this level before without access to sales to players... 
the only serious option that comes to mind is the HG one, as cliched as 
that is.
