Didn't see this posted here yet, so sorry if it already was.  The link
below is to a CNN online video about EQ. Not sure who the people are who
are being interviewed, but it's a well done piece with a lot of
background information on VI's servers, customer service, and some
player opinions. Runs in Quicktime, so you may need to download the
plug-in if you dont' already have it. Two minutes or so in length. Nice
piece, and doesn't bash the game.
