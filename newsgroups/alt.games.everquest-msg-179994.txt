	Take a number.

	I went to at least twice that many raids over five months to get my
emerald.  There were weeks wherein I spent over 40 hours on Hate raids.  I
know Rangers who did twice the time I did and came up empty, eventually giving
up.

	It was a guaranteed drop off Innoruuk when he was a once/week spawn and
the only source for the emerald.  When it moved to the minis with a 2-3 day
spawn time it became random and, on most servers, very, very rare.

	It does seem to be as streaky as is usual for EQ's random number
generator.  On one of the last Hate raids we did before the guild imploded, we
got at least three.  When mine dropped, only half the minis were up, including
Maestro, who dropped it for me, and then we got another one off an upstairs
boss -- and we found out later an Asian raid had killed the other half of the
minis and stopped when they got one.
