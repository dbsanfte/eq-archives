and because you had to adhere to the rules means there will be no exceptions
come hell or high water? you are legal and this gives you the right to be
vindictive?

how much of the eula have you read? if more than a few words then you are
definitely a minority

maybe some of you guys enjoyed being hall monitors in school, you're
probably in management positions right now and disliked by those whose beans
you are responsible for counting. I dont know...... but "I" wouldnt have
petitioned for something so insignificant, rules or not.

several as a matter of fact, and many more that I can come up with at the
drop of a hat :p

actually, I petitioned a GM myself upon finding out the rules on naming and
had *my own* surname changed to comply..... mind you, I was level 22 when I
did this, and I only really knew about the rules because they were reposted
on the eq website.

the GM was quite cordial and even allowed me to use an apostrophe in my new
surname
