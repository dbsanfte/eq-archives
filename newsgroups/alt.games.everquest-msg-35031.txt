You appear to be very curious about a great many things but I don't see that
this is of any importance in anyway, shape or form. Unless of course you see
it as a problem that there maybe gay players in EQ (of course there are) and
you could end up grouped with them, best wear rubber gloves whenever
playing, better safe than sorry. be suspicious of anyone playing Half Elf
Bards, always a dead giveaway.
