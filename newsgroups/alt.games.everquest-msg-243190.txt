Thanks for all the input.  I created a DE Nec.  He has been a ton of fun
once I finally found my way out of my starting city.
What a CRAP city to get around in.  I thought FP, WFP, EFP, NFP, Underground
FP was confusing.  I still don ot know how I got out to NF.

That is my next question:
Is there a good map of these cities?
Can I find a Nec Guide outside of my home city?
Is there a good/safe place to purchase my spells outside my city?

Thanks for all the help......Ben
