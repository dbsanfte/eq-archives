    I was under the crazy impression that your DUAL WIELD skill governed
your dual wield percentage, your DOUBLE ATTACK skill governed your double
attack percentage, your RIPOSTE skill governed your riposte rate, your DODGE
skill governed your dodge rate, and your PARRY skill governed your parry
rate. Are you saying these percentages rise against red-con (raid) targets
as you level?
