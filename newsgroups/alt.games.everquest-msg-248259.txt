EQ2 isn't going to be EQ with better graphics. There are all sorts of
game play changes which you will either like or hate and those that
hate will likely return to EQ. I am reaching burn out with EQ having
played since beta 4, my guild of long time players are slowly drifting
away out of "Been there, done that". Throw in new monsters and new
dungeons, but it remains the same game you played since it went live.

I know I am leaving EQ when 2 comes out. I hate to say it but, forget
the great graphics, I love what they are doing with the mechanics.
Many things that irritate me about EQ seem to have been addressed in
2. Examples, No more KSing, once you or your party engages the MoB, an
outsider can not out damage you and take the Mobs exp and drops. Two,
no race/class restriction; wizzy trolls and DE druids anybody?
Three,Much easier for good or evil races to switch their alliances.
You wanna be a good allied Dark Elf or Troll, it will be possible.
Four, no more getting killed by somebody's train; If trained, the Mobs
agros stay on the trainer. They won't agro on you unless you either
pull them from the train or approach them once they have returned to
their spawn point. I also want to experience a player owned boat and
caravan adventure.

I won't buy the next expansion for EQ as I see nothing much new that I
haven't already experienced before in all the last expansions except
hard and faster hitting MoBs. Where as hardcore EQ players see EQ2 as
a threat to EQ, I see Sony trying to find a way to suck me back into
another 5 years of payments to them.
