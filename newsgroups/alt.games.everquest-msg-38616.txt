yeah, they exist fine past 50 in places like SEB, etc. Plus the sk can
solo to 60, key word is can ;) Another thing is Sk works better in
small groups up to 60, for example a 55 druid and a 55 sk is a kick
butt group who can get things done (since the sk can fear) while a 55
druid and 55 warrior is a pretty damn bad group with more downtime
really than the druid would have alone. Sk can be pretty good with
almost any other class, warrior can't in a duo. Even a warrior with a
cleric trying to be a duo would be a very downtime intensive combo.

Sk is really more versitle and able to get in more of a variety of
groups up to 60 than a warrior is, especially since now yet ANOTHER
great thing the sk brings to the table besides fear and a snaring
ability is corpse summoning.
