I pretty much agree with all of your complaints and could prolly add
several myself, namely all the bugs and group dependency. I've been
playing since release now, and have become more and more annoyed with
the game as time as wore on. Once you get past all the graphical fluff
and the one or two new small innovations, the game is just missing
something that EQ1 had. Even now, logging on has already become a
chore, and I've only been playing for a month :|

Yep, instead of fixing the real problems with the game that let those
issues be a problem, they took the easy solution and just disallowed
alot of stuff.

I did manage to solo up to about level 18 effectively, but hit a brick
wall shortly thereafter. Now, it takes several con yellow solo mobs
just to give me 1%, and there's only 1 or 2 places in the whole game
that I can effectively solo at.

At first glace, EQ2 seemed great, and I definitely got drawn in for
awhile and no doubt that I wanted to like it... I never thought that
I'd be wanting to quit so soon. :(
