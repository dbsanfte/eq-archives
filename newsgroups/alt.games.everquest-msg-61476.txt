Hybrid ranger 55, so I dont spend a *long* time looking at the spellbook but
I do mem and unmem spells a fair bit.

Me too. No issues at all. Trak raid last night, entire guild there, monk
clearing didnt go far enough for CoH, get a few jugs, the protector, trak,
everyone packed into a small corridor, spell effects still on full, etc,
no problems turing around to peek about, etc.

Definitely not. I played solidly from 9pm to 1am yesterday helping prep the
raid, clear past the shrooms, get the CoH groups down to get everyone else
there without the dull fight down, etc. 

I also had my virus checker and zonealarm pro (which I think Lokari recommended
here ;) ) running just to see how they'd hold up on the new system and didnt
notice many issues.

One weird thing though is the loading from disk causes slight stalls - i.e.
if I turn around to see 100 people I havent seen I get a crunch pause while
it works out what they all look like. Susequently I can spin in circles without
issue and watch them zoom about - that never used to happen, but I *think* it
may just be because I am still using my old hard disk with the new bits and
its probably a little slow for them.

I got advice from geekfriends in the pub who told me to go run the nvidia
uh.. 21.88 I think it was drivers which they said fixed a lot of issues 
including memory leaks and I ran the latest drivers from VIA for the 
motherboard, AGP and IDE stuff.

All in all it was a royal pain in the arse, an unbelievable amount of crap to
find, download, learn and install, but it works ok now.
