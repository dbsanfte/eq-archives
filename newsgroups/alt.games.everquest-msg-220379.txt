   If there are no homes for the offspring, then the animal should be neutered.

   If there are no homes for the offspring, then the animal should be neutered.  

   It really isn't that hard of a concept.  You can try to muddy up the
statement as much as you want.  But the point is, if there are no homes for the
offspring, then the animal should be neutered.

   The point about papered animals was made since generally speaking, if an
animal has papers, it is easier to find homes for the offspring.  But if there
are no homes for the offspring, then the animal should be neutered.

   All my cats (we have five) are "mutts".  We don't care one whit that they
aren't papered.  But there would be no homes for their offspring, so we had them
neutered.
