	BTW, what's the point of twinking newbie armor??  If you dont want
to do the quest with the alt why not just go *buy* something 10x as good in
te bazaar??

	I did my newbie armor quests in Crushbone by sneaking in and looting
the nodrop orc pieces from dead orcs...  Got the bronzes that way too, had
a whole set of leafrunner including the scimitar by like level 10...  I'd
kill the ones I could and loot every body I saw, most of those things are
useless to anyone but a wood elf anyway so they're always laying around.
