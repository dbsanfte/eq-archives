Perhaps the guild is doing something wrong, reports seem to indicate 2 or 4
primal per visit.  Then again, I didn't pay much attention, those were my guilt
free non raiding days!

Why on earth would the guild keep raiding the place once all melee are equipped
with primals?  They seem to be useless in the hands of anyone else.  Even in the
hands of melee, they tend to be "use till proc, then equip a real weapon"
implements.

How?  Why?  The melee already have better weapons, don't they?  And we have
shaman in droves, is the primal proc really that much better than 62 shaman
buffs (cast by 65 shaman, mind you, but spectral are slow in coming and Shadow
are nothing but a rumor to us)

Sigh.  I probably am missing something about these primal weapons.  But come
now, we are talking stuff that drops in an expansion two releases old, surely
mere mudflation has put better items in our reach already?

ST and Primal are things I've happily ignored for most of the duration of play,
now that I'm stuck helping out on the project, I'd love to hear why its so all
fired important.
