I liked my VP key and my VT key and I'm a ranger. About the only bit
that really annoyed me was the sanctus seru guards. I was still at the
stage of the game for both though that I had good company and found the
key quests interesting because they took me all over and made me see
places and do things... It wasnt 'stupid bloody grind to delay me 
getting to phat lewts' it was 'ooo, fun thing to do'.

I have, however, only done them once each, for one character ;) So
clearly I didnt enjoy them enough to want to do them *twice* ;)
