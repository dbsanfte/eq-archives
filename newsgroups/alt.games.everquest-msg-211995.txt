Irrelavant.
We're what about four years into EQ now? 
Given the age of this game, even a level 34 can easily be outfitted in
some of the lower end dragonbone stuff from western waste.  Hell, you
can buy most of that in bazaar for chump change.

As a ranger?  Yep.
Because outside of monks, weight of a weapon should be a non-factor.
The only thing to concern yourself would be damage output which is
based solely on damage/delay and in a minor way, the procs (if any).

Now, there is some argument in later levels (PoP levels that is),
between dual weilding vs. 2H weapons, but that's something a 34th
level ranger doesn't have to deal with for a while.

You know, I honestly can't remember the last time my toon got hit by a
debuff spell that dropped his str and I've been playing this game
since beta.  I've leveled up every character class to 60+ and now play
a 65 monk.
