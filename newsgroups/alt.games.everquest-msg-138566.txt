Probably because pets are mobs, and so use the same rules as mobs.  Go to
some newbie or lowbie area sometime and aggro a bunch of different kinds of
mobs (use different mobs so you can tell them apart in the status messages).
Get 6 or 7.  Notice how only 4 actually try to melee you at once?

This can lead to things that are kind of funny.  I was using my 50+ Wizard
once to do a little powerleving of my new Monk.  Strat is DS on the Monk,
and pull things with Wizard's Staff of Temperate Flux, and then let the Monk
melee them.  If I pull something tough, and the monk gets in trouble, I can
taunt it off with SoTF, or root it and stand closer, and then nuke it when
it is under half, but mostly I was just using the Wizard to gather mobs
faster for the Monk.

Anyway, the Wizard has about 20 mobs aggroed, all deep deep green to him.
At any given time, four of them are standing in his face, trying to hit him,
but mostly missing.  The rest are all standing around, at a respectable
distance, waiting their turn.  Whenever the Monk kills one of the four,
another rushes in from the surrounding circle to take its place.

I've occasionally wondered if this could be exploited.  E.g., if you are
going to cross a dangerous area with high level mobs, aggro four of the
wimpiest low level mobs you can find first, and take them with you.  Or one
of the low level mobs back off and let the high level mob come in?
