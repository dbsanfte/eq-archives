You're thinking of banish(ment?) the level 60 one from a previous
expansion.  Destroy Summoned is just an anti-summoned nuke, not as
big as Black Steel, Evoc and has a small resist modifier.

This is already insanely easy with regular pets.

Of 76 respondents to a poll on the Tower recently, only 2 checked
the box "Situationally useful, bring it out more than twice a month"

The fire pet is beyond broken, worthless to the extreme.  We've 
given them a dozen good ideas to make it situationally useful (just 
like all mage pets are supposed to be) and they've just let it
sit.
