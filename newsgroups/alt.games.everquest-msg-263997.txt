Argh 16 hours to go. I need a dvd burner to back up my eq directory :P

I was just thinking about how to revitalise Everquest.

1) Make PC's  zone bonus appropriate. It's not a hard zone. Runnyeye is
hard. Even the warrens can be hard (HOOOJ trains!).

2) make all zone bonuses visible... most people avoid LOIO because it has a
rep as the worst ZEM in the game, it's a pain to get to, vendors are far
away, the guards are kos to basically everybody, the loot sucks

3) make all mobs have a chance of dropping a level appropriate no-drop
augment. OK, maybe ppl would just swarm kite mobs to twink out their alts
but it's just an idea... augments turn mediocre gear into something useful,
and are accessiblke to non raiders. Perhaps the loot code could be
re-applied to the zones noone goes to anyway and those zones could be aug
droppers?

4) Develop the old zones. Have a revolution in cabilis or whatever! Get
people to fight on different sides and let the winner set the tone eg
faction a or b wins... wouldn't it be fun to invade freeport with dark
elves, or smash the theocracy of cabilis and make it a neutral zone open for
anyone with heavy coin? Surely re-writing the mobs's faction could be done
easily by means of a batch file or something? People should be able to make
an impact on their world. At the moment there is no sense of time.

Is there any of this in EQ2 or similar? I mean, in SWG you could temporarily
rewrite the landscape by building your house etc but you had to keep feeding
coins into the slot or it was all gone by the time you logged in again,
which was just tedious.

If people build someting, let it stand while the guild stands. If people win
some gm event, let there be a statue to them, especially if it's major.
Having a spell named after you is very cool and that sort of thing could be
followed up more to make the players a part of the history.
