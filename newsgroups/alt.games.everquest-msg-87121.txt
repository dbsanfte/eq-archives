Imbue Emerald, Cleric guild in South Felwith... go right after you cross the
bridge, past the bank and turn left (it's the sunken doorway facing the
river)

Ensnaring Roots... I think I got my copy at the Kelethin Ranger Guild

tho Imbue Emerald is lvl 29 and Eroot is lvl 24... you've gone 5 levels
without a decent root spell? My congrats ;o)
