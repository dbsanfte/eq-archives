I agree.  Yes it's a game but aren't games supposed to be fun?  So
what if there's maybe no loot in it for you?  Don't you want the pulse
quickening excitement of a near wipe only to come back and win?  Or
maybe it was a wipe but you learned something and had stories to tell
afterwards?

"What's in it for me?"  Sheesh, what is this world coming to?  I play
because it's fun, if it's not then why would I play?  If it's not fun
it's work, and I can get paid for that...
