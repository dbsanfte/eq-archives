I would care...if it was actually happening.
Grouping with idiots is not something caused by plat/char sales. You get to
meet idiots everywhere in life but especially online as there is a larger
cross section of age groups plus the opputonity to act in that manner
without any repercussions.
I have not seen any prices rise in any situation, with the effect of
something in game.

Centi LS's rose and held at the 2k mark due to the nerf in drop rate.
WindBlades had a nerf in the ease they were obtained and so had a similar
price rise.
LSOEE no longer Drops so prices went from 3k to 13k overnight,,,they are now
down to about 5k...they still don't drop, tho.
Can't say why the Glowing Black sword got a price rise, can only assume that
with LoY brought loads of Frog Warriors needing the 20Dex to help with their
flaggin skill levels when being P/L'd..Other than that, not a clue...Unless
SOE changed the proc so it effected the Mob and not the user, then it'd be a
decent(ish) weapon.

Everything else FALLS in price...Name something that has actually had a
price rise due to this "problem"
Or maybe I play on a server where the economy is unaffected by these
"Millions" of plat

I can sort of see why this would bother you...No, ok I can't but I can
understand it does (sort of the same way I'm bothered by dumbass names but
others could care less about them) what I don't agree with is that it is
causing a problem in game...I have met plenty of idiots in game and many of
them have amazing equipment but they have Guild tags and Levels to match it
and are not idiots because they don't know how to play the game. I have yet
to meet a twink that didn't know what he was doing...perhaps I am just
lucky.
