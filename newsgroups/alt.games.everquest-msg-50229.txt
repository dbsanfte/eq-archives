personally I would never - never suggest deleting any char.  well, with a
few exceptions.  If your under 6th, its not as big a loss.

1)  if you turned in a book on a blue server to PvP, you won't be healable
by clerics.  you will be red instead of blue overhead, and you pretty much
just screwed your char.  if you did this you should probably recreate a new
char, delete that one.  especially if your under 6th.

my suggestion for you instead of deleting this 31st mage is to switch to
another server, wait 2 months, and get luclin.  Believe that they are going
to let people have 2 chars then on Sullon Zek, so you will then have one
more slot available to make a char on that server again if you don't wanna
play your mage.  If your friends want to play with you they can follow you
to another server.

another possibility is to transfer your mage to another server, although I
don't see the point in spending real money to save a dude your even
contemplating deleting.  But at least you would save all that work for a
little money down.

My strongest reason for not deleting chars is for the simple reason that if
your interested in achieving power; that is,  walking thru a zone knowing
nothing can really touch you, amassing huge amounts of wealth, or getting
awesome items then you can only get this from the higher end game.   I think
the first item that really thrilled me to finally get was the golden efreeti
boots.  I was about 46th level.  several other items I worked hard to get,
but they weren't really in comparison in terms of value or difficulty to
attain.

To go back to another point I made, I cannot stress enough that there are
tons of different chars you can make on other servers.  Sullon Zek is not
the only server out there, and to delete a char who is just starting to
achieve some real power would be a shame.

I found it funny (also sad) that some people would almost get to 20th, and
then delete their chars, to restart.  they would do this about 2 or 3 times.
Sometimes not even transfering equipment / plat between these deletes.

I personally know of a paladin who was about 35th or 45th, he deleted his
char, and gave away everything.  eventually he got back on and several
people donated stuff to him, but he had to work day and night to get back to
where he was.  think how much further he would of been had he not deleted
his char in the first place.

I've personally gone on hiatus for months upon months at a time, but
deleting the char was never an option.
