Sorry, I should have been more clear :-P

Mages had it worst when I was doing them :)

Yes, Katta saved many a mage who did 34-44
after SoL came out.  And, while you can't buy
the 49 pets in Katta, you can buy the 44 pets
needed to research the 49 pets.  That was
what I was referring to in terms of chain
research - I.E. that a mage needed the appropriate
pet of the previous level to research that
pet of the current level.  In the case of the
49 water pet a mage had to research 39 water
to get 44 water to get 49 water.  In addition,
research was far more expensive since we needed
a spell in addition to the 2 other components,
where others just needed the drop components and
could do practice research in the field.

Since all my research work (with the exception
of 49 fire) was done pre Katta, I forget at
times that new mages have it so much easier.
