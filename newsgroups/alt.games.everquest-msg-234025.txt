Yes it's safe (well, I think a roamer paths in Sand, I may be wrong).

First, run to the top of any of the wings (invis works as long as no
names are up) - there's a little teleport stone at the top of each.

The one in water is right behind where Oreen spawns, the one in sand
is behind where Gaukr spawns.  These take you to the courtyard (the
camp called Bees on Lanys).  In the NE, NW, SW, SE corners of the CY
are sets of steps flanked by structures very like the zone out.  Click
on the right one (with a key) and you go into the appropriate tower,
on the left one and you return to the BoT entrance.

To get out just jump through the nearest portal or gate out.
