0%, 90%, or 100%.

Some prefer 90% when going fully for AA's to keep their regular exp at
10% (90% AA) so that they dont lose their level.

That's the smartest thing to do.  Imagine if you could get the
experience you get now per kill, but apply it toward leveling from,
say, level 37 to 38.  How fast would it take to get level 38?  This is
how AA works, it takes fewer and fewer kills of mobs matching your
level to earn an AA and you can do more and more DPS to the ones you
do kill...if you put off getting AA's til later.

A level 65 can get an AA in anywhere from 30 minutes or less, up to
maybe a few hours, depending on the kind of exp they are getting.  At
51 it will take hours and hours and hours to get that same AA--the
same time it would take to level from 51 to 52.

Another thing to consider is the benefit you get from those AAs.  Run3
is great.  You could argue (wrongly IMO) that it would be worth
putting off more levels for run3 since Necros kite a lot.  After that,
you get crap for AA skills until you earn at *least* 15 to 20 more
AA's.

Whoopie, you can get 3 more mana regen per tic...Of course if you had
spent the time it took to get those 12 AAs in to leveling, you could
be level 63 and be using arch lich, regenning 15 more mana per tic
instead.  (And one level from Seduction of Sarym--50/tic)

...you would have a single dot that does 40 DPS all by itself, not to
mention several other spell and pet upgrades.

...you would be able to easily solo in neat places like Veksar.  (59+
pets are unfearable)

...you could much more easily get groups (or solo) in zones like
PoValor.

...you could enter zones like BoT and begin looting ornate
molds/patterns or HoH, which is very popular for Necros.

...you and your pet would look like Spectres.

...you would have cool spells for helping others like a group mana
tap, Conjure Corpse, Levant, Convergence (resurrect), Manaskin, a
componentless rune (f'ing awesome spell), a mez spell for undead that
works on mobs up to level 65, etc...

You could have all of this, or you could have +3 mana regen, run 3,
and still be level 51, still hunting in the same zones.

It always takes the same points of experience to get an AA point
independent of how many you have.  They come at the same rate...at
least until you get more regular levels, at which point they come
several times faster.
