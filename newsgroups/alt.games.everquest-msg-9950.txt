I'd recommend against human in each of those cases, Half-elf or halfling
for the druid, half elf for the ranger, and barbarian , dorf, halfling,
gnome, or wood-elf for the warrior.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
