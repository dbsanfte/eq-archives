Please don't. If there is a single add, the Cleric can handle it.
You'll just muck it up by trying to "draw aggro" from him. If there's
two or three adds and you got your Cleric, Wizard, Druid, Shaman,
whatever, any two of us, we can handle them. Just focus on the mob the
MT is on.

As a Cleric, if I draw aggro from a single mob (or even two for that
matter), I can simply stun, step back and root. In fact, if there is a
single add and the group has no Enchanter, I will often try to draw
aggro so I can go park it away from the rest of the group. This saves
me mana and makes me happy. If you try to draw aggro at this time,
you'll either keep me from being able to park it away from the group,
thus costing me mana and pissing me off, or you'll break the root and
the mob will be right back on me, thus costing me mana and pissing me
off, maybe killing me - which pisses me off almost as much as wasting
mana.

So listen up. If you're in a group, get an add or three, and you've
got a cadre full of casters, don't worry about the adds. We'll handle
them. If you try to mess with the adds, you're gonna get someone
killed.
