I'd read that it was to calm the mages down. The wizards were getting MC
back, since it was a pre req for Manaburn, and a fairly useless waste of
AA points if you weren't.  The mages noted that many of them took innate
regen to help with recovery from all the mod rodding they do.

Seems like a pretty damned good one to me. I already have Run Speed
three and I'm on the fence about taking either regen or bandaging for my
next three. It's a good AA skill, IMO, no matter how you slice it.
