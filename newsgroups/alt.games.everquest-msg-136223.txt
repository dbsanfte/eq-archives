turning human male off works wonders too.

And for god sake folks, there are a million stalls, use them

If you can't read your name and your neighbours, you'r way to close
together. And if you insist on parking your vending behind right ontop of
someone else, remember the little guys. I can't begin to count the number of
times I start of in a stall all of my own to come back on hour later staring
at a huge barbarian b*tt. I hate that.
A little consideration. If you insist of jamming 400 people into one stall,
tall folks in the back, short folks in the front.

There, nice guide BTW. Pity we can't sell traders satchels though.
