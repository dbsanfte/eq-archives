Well I have only quad kited with my wizard, but the principal is the same,
wizard and druid just start the quad off differentley though.

Step 1: Mem the correct spells

AOE Nuke (not pbaoe), your best / most mana efficient one.
Ensnare
Gate
SoW
Lower level finisher nuke (maybe aoe also depend on mob)
Harmony / Harmony of nature
Best heal

Step 2: Find the mobs!

I believe there is a level by level guide on Graffes, although wizards /
druids get their AOE nukes at different stages, it should give you an idea
of what you can do.  At your level till level 46 I did the dwarves in
butcherblock.

  I guess you are not too interested in faction for this guy, and if you
have the mana pool there are two quads for your level range in butcherblock,
one past the aqua goblin camps, the other at the dock.  Some of the dwarves
are on a seperate faction that is not inside kaladim (kaladim merchants I
think), but if you want to quad the first lot you have to add a dwarf that
gives faction hits, or you can just kite three. They have around 1000 hit
points each if I remember correctley.

Step 3: Prepare for the quad!

With my wizard, I aggrod all the dorfs (cast on one, the two inside will
aggro, have to aggro the other as it was not KoS), then I run them into a
pack by running circles around them, then run off a fair distance and hit
them with AOE snare (re-casting if any resist).

For a druid, you would typically snare the mobs one by one, use Harmony (aoe
lull, irresitable, works on up to lvl40 mobs) on the one outside, and it
should hit the two inside.  Now I am not sure but I think you can cast
through the hut they are in, if that is the case, get those two targetted
(or all three / four with the new cycle thing), and snare them one by one.

Once you have four mobs snared, you now proceed to run them into a pack, so
basically they are all on top of each other.  Try not to get hit :)

Step 4: Begin the nuking!

Not sure what the druid cast times are on their AOE's (guessing a little
longer than wiz), I generally get to out of nuke range, then spam AOE until
it casts.  Try and keep them in a pack, if they split up, go back to step 3.
You may get some resists (the dorfs are not very resistant, though), which
is where the smaller nuke comes in, complete the quad, then finish off any
stragglers with your lower nuke.

Step 5: Loot and Med.

Quadding IS very mana intensive, my wizard was a little twinked and went to
around 30% mana per quad depending on resists, the bonus is you are
basically getting 4 mobs worth of EXP for 2 mobs worth of mana.  Remember
you can get Clarity 2 at level 41 (extended has an ok duration).


A good place to practice quadding until you get the hang of it is gnoll
spires in south karana, few adds, they walk kinda slow (two legged mobs
usually slower than four legged), dont resist much and wont hit you hard.
You also have a zone line closeby if things go wrong, and plenty of space to
run around in for your quadding.  I was quadding here at 29 with my wizard
:)

Kind of late in the AM so if anything sounds weird / wrong etc here, point
it out and will try to clarify if nobody else does.

Charm kiting I believe is a bard only thing, using the swarm of mobs dps to
almost kill his pet, then he breaks charm and finishes pet, before charming
another.

Aggro kiting is fairly simple, snare is pretty much required (or at least,
very handy), making druids / rangers etc good to have in aggro kiting
groups. One person keeps major aggro on the target mob (must be a non
summoner), using whatever spells then can. The 'aggro-ee' runs around pretty
much in circles, while the rest of the party does as much damage as they can
without pulling aggro (sometimes it doesnt matter as long as whoever has
aggro keeps on moving).

People also sometimes use charmed mobs when aggro kiting, another possible
use of the term 'charm kiting', but would probably just call it aggro kiting
(pets are often a part of aggro kiting groups).

Quad kiting isnt about keeping mana up, you will typically burn most of it
in a quad (sacriligeous to a cleric, maybe :) ), then med up for the next
one.  Yes, this way really is faster :) (I found it faster than grouping,
doing the dwarves).

Once you have get the technique down and done it several hundred times, the
novelty does wear off, but it is a fun way (and sometimes dangerous) to get
exp, solo :)

Hope that helps in some way.
