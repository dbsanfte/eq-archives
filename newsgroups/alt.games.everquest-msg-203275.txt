<<<<<You are completely missing the point he, and many others, made here.  
Those same players that levelled up with KEI and did not learn the skills 
are now in high level zones.  That is the problem he is pointing out 
which you somehow managed to miss here.  As he said, this does not mean 
that all players who got KEI at low levels are unskilled, but, far too 
many are.  They are suddenly having to learn mana and aggro management in 
the higher level zones, when they should have learned those skills over 
time as they levelled up.>>>>>>

I'm afraid it is you that is missing the point sir.  These people still have
access to KEI, nothing has changed for them.  If you want to suggest that you
are looking to prevent this for future players then perhaps you have some
degree of a point but the way you are saying it you don't.
