Well, I thought they went through the logs for the Conquest event.  I 
didn't realize they were in /guildchat in realtime.  I about blew a gasket 
last night when someone referred to our Hoshkar strategy as an exploit.  I 
know that calling AEs, and having casters pop around the corner, nuke, and 
go back is just good planning, but I don't want to get involved with some 
GM in a bad mood talking about us knowing that we're exploiting.  (Hint, 
AEs don't go around corners, though if you don't know that by now, you 
probably aren't dropping many AEing mobs.)

Yeah, but I had always assumed they had to look through logs to find it.  
I was rather suprised (though I shouldn't have been) that GMs could insert 
themselves into a guild and spy.  Which just begs the question:  why isn't 
there a GM in Dead of Winter (griefers on Innoruuk) at all times?
