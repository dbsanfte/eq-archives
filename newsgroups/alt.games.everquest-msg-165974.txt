Groups aren't all that common in EW because it's a soloers paradise.  Warning: 
if you run up and down between the ulthork valley and the ocean kiting 4
ulthorks / walruses into other people you will get bitched at.  Mightily. 
Nothing pisses people off worse.  Take your crap out into the wilds to kite for
God's sake.  Ulthork tusks sell for great plat to other players or do the quest
yourself in Cobolt Scar.  Great quest!  You can probably do the orc centaurians
at the Ry`Gorr fort, you WILL need to use harmony to single pull.  Take the
orcs up over the hill into the flat area west of the coldain camp and run them
around in a circle til dead.   If you get in trouble you can always run
directly east to the iceclad bridge, don't train them to the Crystal Cavern
zone unless you announce your train to the zone.  Set up a hotkey either way.  

You might be able to get a group in Crystal Cavern, but there is no room to
kite there at all.
My advice:  If you are looking for a group go to the Overthere.  Druids have no
problem getting groups there.  Be prepared to do a lot of "backup healer" work,
keep everyone sowed.  And when you *can't* find a group, (which is rare)  there
is plenty to solo.  At your level I bound myself near the FM zone and kited
stuff from just east of the ledge northeast towards the warslick woods zone. 
Sit high up on the mountainside, med, and start back with another critter. 
Sarnak Berzerkers and rhinos may resist your snares alot at this level, and can
outrun sow.  I mainly did cockatrices and sabretooths.  Their teeth sell for
plat.   And again, don't kite your mobs near other groups.
Get KEI and you will get a level before it wears off every time, if you play
right and are careful.
