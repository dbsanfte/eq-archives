65. Speed of Vallon, Ranger ATK buffs, maybe one or two vengeance/AOB
items each, Shaman buffs.

Sure; no objection to hearing some other numbers at all. If I'm
using a pokey parser I'd like to know about it.

If we're going to start getting specific however its EQC 0.71 -
other figures were a ranger parsing around 70-80dps with melee,
80-90 with archery, a warrior (not tanking) parsing about 58, a
tanking SK parsing about 45 and a bard parsing about 30, so it wasnt
like it was just adding 100 to everything either.

The monks and rogues were noticably head and shoulders above everyone
else.

Indeed, I understand that. Regardless, however, ferocity 3 / PB2
was making up for it by these figures. I also find it hard to imagine
that the parser would favour one monk over another consistently,
even if it was giving figures that were out of whack with other
parsers for some reason.

Yes. Primal monk had Ambidex, 2hb monk had ferocity/punishing; I
didnt ask about other AA's. If you're really curious I'll get a
full run down from them tonight on equipment and AAXPs to see whats
up.
