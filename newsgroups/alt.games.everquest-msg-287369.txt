Sounds about right  :D

My lvl 28 made 16 levels in 2 days, and as you say, at first it was
around 2 levels per LDoN.  Sony ram-raided XP to players to get them
all so high they could enjoy the new stuff.  It really angered me to
have a game I loved become a "Monty Haul" joke.  People were earning
AA points by the hundred, I kid you not!  People who earned levels and
AA points the hard way were disgusted, at least in my guild and from
what I saw in OOC.  Typical Sony balls-up.

Yeah - the MUD my pals and I played on the BBS was far more
sophisticated and much better suited to the gaming intelligentsia.
Graphics were for the poor drooling masses who lacked any imagination
whatsoever.  :P  (Sounds as stupid as his comment, you reckon?  Maybe
not.)

Making EQ the equivalent to Noughts and Crosses   :D
