So? I have a 54 druid

- who just happens to spend large amounts of her time as primary or
only healer in groups with up to 5 melees.

The incident that triggered my comment about not being too pleased
when grouped with rangers who forget they're the snarer was when I was
only healer in a group in some corner of Chardok. For more than an
hour, I kept a a level 60 warrior in berzerker state (on his request),
buffed everyone, and fire/AC debuffed our targets. The ranger was in
charge of snaring, and I was medding just far enough away to not see
spell messages when things landed. So, it was annoying to suddenly see
one in every three or four mobs start running and have to snare them
myself before they got too far away, because it'd slipped the ranger's
mind that HE was the one supposed to be doing that.

But then again, I wasn't really doing anything nearly as important as
snaring anyway, was I?
