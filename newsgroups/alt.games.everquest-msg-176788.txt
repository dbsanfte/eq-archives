As I've been scribing new spells and moving them around, I've noticed
that anywhere I've scribed a spell and then moved it to a blank spot,
the blank spot that is now where the spell was I can't scribe anything
in.  I get the message as if there were a spell there already, but
there isn't.

Anyone else having this problem?

I'm also unable to get any links to work other than in the chat
channels.  I did a thourogh file check but no fix...
