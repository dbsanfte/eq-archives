Sure, sometimes.  But, well, *my* warrior seldom has trouble.

For one thing, the tanks don't have to spend the whole battle staring
into the mob's baby blues.  One thing my warrior will often do during
a quiet moment is set himself up in front of the casters, facing the
direction mobs are likely to come from.  Hit F9 4 times, then swivel
the view around until you're looking at the whole party.

Then do it again during a battle.  You'll probably have to swivel it
again a bit and miss out on a Kick or something, but it's worth it,
because now you can see your whole party.  If you need to move, you
just need to hit F9 once more and you're back to first person.

FWIW.

Thanks for the advice, btw.
