It's damn near useless.  What it does is reduce the remaining duration of a
spell on the target.  So if, for example, the spell had 15 minutes remaining
on it, it would have 12 remaining after the cast.  Or something like that. 

I pulled those numbers out of my ass, no idea how correct they are, probably
not very much at all.

The most useless spell I have in my spellbook is "Illusion: Gnome".
