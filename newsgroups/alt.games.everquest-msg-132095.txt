Cheap place to start is to find a smith to get you in a full set of banded
armour.
Shiny brass shield or chitin shield.
1hs a crystal fiber is usually cheap for 2hs axe of the iron back.

to get plat and exp to upgrade go to  paludal then netherbian lair(current
popular spots) or hhp then hhk ( still popular but not crowded and no
lists )or group up kill bandit camps in Karanas and do red sash quest (WK
zone empty so bring a friend.)

good source of plat sell silk swatches and spiderling silk. upper guk
spiders. again bring a friend.
