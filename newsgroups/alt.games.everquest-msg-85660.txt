/agree

Having /auto doesn't help much at all.  The feature is broken, has
been broken and will always stay broken.  There is an absolute refusal
to fix it, and it almost sound conspiritorical (that a word)?

Reason they don't fix it: Because then evertime someone loots, all the
mobs money would get broken down into least common denomination, then
everyone would have hundreds of gold and be bitching.

Best solution, don't group with strangers or greed hungry idiots.  If
must group with strangers, hope they are a shameless twink, since they
don't loot anyways.

And if anyone says mob drop cash is "pocket change", have you ever
been in an honest group with a master loot, get a split and its a few
hundred plat? Little more than pocket change for this poor cleric.
