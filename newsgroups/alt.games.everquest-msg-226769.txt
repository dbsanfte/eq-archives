All in all, I agree with kaev.  While I don't play a healer, let alone a 
cleric, I sure want one in my group!  And, while I'm only lvl 30 atm, I 
know that there are times I'm gonna have to bite it so the rest of the 
group can survive.  I have afriend that plays a Paladin, and HE would 
rather take the death (or near death) than let the group get it...just 
his style.  

In a perfect group, everyone is willing to take the death if it means the 
group makes it out alive..whether that means killing the mob, running to 
a zone, evac'ing - whatever.

When you get that group, cherish it.  I just got out of an adventure 
where the cleric kept us all alive...and did it well.  (In fact, just 
before a bad pull with 3 adds, she told us that the tankwas priority 
unless one of us started taking massive abuse.  Then again, we were 2 
necros, a mage, the cleric, a wiz (me) and a pally as tank/puller.  Guess 
who was gonna get beat up the most!)  

Furthurmore, and lastly, I applaud you efforts thus far (only 6 deaths? 
WOW!), and greatly appreciate your concern over this one.  Don't let it 
get you down, but keep the faith (well, you ARE a cleric, right?). A good 
cleric is vital to me, and you seem to be tops.  

Uh, that's all.
