Basically yes, it's not as clear cut as that but for the most part using
poor pathing to gain an advatage is an offense. Most common one that nearly
everyone will come into contact with is next to the stairs for the SF zone
in OT, people would use this to fear kite into and mobs would run into the
stairs and just keep running, this became a bannable offense.

Apparently so, not sure how you would get caught or if they actually care
but yes it is apparently an exploit *if* you are not at your keyboard.

Hard to prove all the time but against the rules and would get a warning/ban

Nope, nothing wrong with this.

Not your job to be every newbie's saviour, it is not even against the rules
to laugh at them as they die :ï¿½)

> 4) ninja looting

The "true" definition of ninja looting, afaik,  is looting from a mob that
you had no involvement in the kill, this is against Verants rules not sure
what they would do about it tho. Just excessively looting or looting
something that you did not win the roll for is not likely to have a GM or
Guide intervene but your reputation, after the latter, would be permanently
soiled.

> 5)Kill stealing

Intentionally and constant will get you in trouble

At least this is how I see it from my experience.
