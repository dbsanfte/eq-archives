So, as I've stated elsewhere in this thread to other people responding with
off the wall and utterly bizarre analogies, you're postulating that he gave
back all that he contracted for?  Nowhere has that been stated, and I don't
think anyone has the thought that that actually transpired.  He *kept* what
he contracted for *and* took back the money.

Let me fix your analogy.

You bought a shirt that turned out to have a hole in it, so you went back to
the store and took the money you paid out of the register while nobody was
looking.

Yes, it follows that you stole the money.  Thanks for playing.
