You can make 32 in LOIO without Haste, wearing Crafted/FinePlate, and
with a BABS (24/39 2hs) as your "uh oh, I'm losing, better get out the
big axe" weapon.  I never did find a place to solo my Warrior beyond
that tho.  Crucial gear for my gimp-solo Warrior were his various pieces
of cheap HP gear:  Crafted BP, Skull-shaped Barbute, Platinum Fire
Wedding Rings, and a couple other pieces worth 10hp each or thereabouts.
Take the HP gear off when bandaging (careful don't kill yourself if low
hp) and you can get up to 55-60%, depending on level, STA, and gear.
