He's right.  17 USC 109(b)(1)(A).  Here's a summary/paraphrase of 17
USC 109.  I don't feel like typing the whole thing in, so you'll have
to look it up if you want the details:

17 USC 109(a)says:
	If you own a particular copy, you can sell or otherwise
dispose of possession of it, without that being in violation of the
copyright holder's exclusive right to control distribution.  (lending
counts as disposing possession, so this is the section that makes
libraries legal).

17 USC 109(b)(1)(A)
	Section 109(a) does not apply to sound recordings or computer
programs if you are renting, leasing, or lending for direct or
indirect commercial advantage.  (It also covers anything "in the
nature of" a rental, lease, or loan...which means those schemes where
stores "sell" you the program, but let you return it for a "restocking
fee" aren't as clever as they think they are).

17 USC 109(b)(1)(B)
	109(b)(1)(A) does not apply if the computer program is
embedded in a product and cannot be copied during the ordinary
operation of the product (e.g., car rental companies can lease cars
without needing permission of the company that wrote the engine
control software).  109(b)(1)(A) does not apply to programs for
systems designed for playing games.
