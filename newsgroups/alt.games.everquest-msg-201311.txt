If I've got what your saying (it does seem to make sense) this seems harsh!

From what I remember, the pre 50 hell levels were basically removed by
adding an xp multiplier in just on those levels - meaning it didn't affect
those around it.

However, it looks like from 50 - 59 this isn't how they've worked it.
Instead they've made the earlier levels harder in order to make the later
ones easier, and haven't actually changed the overall amount of xp needed.
This would mean 50 - 60 would take longer than before (although without such
nasty big levels at the end of it) as the rate of gain of xp you get at 51
is obviously slower than at 59.

Waaaaa! I'm a (very!) slow leveler, and was 46 when these changes were made.
Now 51 - I feel like I've got the short end of the stick here!
