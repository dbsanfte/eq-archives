Probably not, since the Soviet economy was growing faster than the US 
economy in the fifties. The weaknesses inherent in the communist regime 
didn't make themselves apparent until later. Stalin was regarded, 
rightly, as an aberration.

Not at all. They are a resourceful, cultured people, and the Soviet 
regime was focused on growth and economic development (Lenin's recipe of 
"electricity plus Soviets"). It would have been amazing if they *didn't* 
become one, and I'm sure they will be a superpower again before long.

I can't say I subscribe to that view.
