Do you mean that as a single question?  Necromancer is hands down the best
solo class overall.  In PvP necro is quite good, but also suffers from a
major handicap.  You won't find another class with fewer HP.  That makes
them exciting to play in PvP, but definitely not the best.

Best PvP is probably bard.  Tough to kill a bard in PvP and the only class I
will avoid dueling if I know the bard is good.
