"They suck" means "its terrible exp per hour."  If the exp per mob is now three
times the exp it was, then perhaps we need to take a new look at camps to see
which ones still suck and which ones are now the golden fleece.

Throw what you "know" out the window, and look at the landscape anew.

I know, for example, that I used to be able to solo a light blue mob in SF
for about half a bar of mana, or a dark blue mob for a full bar.  Where I
logically went for the light blues, getting 70% of the exp per kill I would
with the dark blues, with less risk, and a total of 140% of the exp per hour
along with twice the loot drop (all wyverns seem to have the same drop
rate) now I might find I get 25% as much exp off the light blue, meaning
50% as much exp per hour.  So I have to balance twice as much exp
versus half as much loot.

Of course the new situation in SF being what it is, I instead moved to
Cyan mobs, where I can kill five per bar of mana, and give absolutely
not a care in the world to the fact that I'm perhaps getting a tenth the
exp output, all I want is shards shards shards.
