Then it's all OK then, because David didn't suggest it.  He suggested that
if CoH discussion had to exist, that they keep it into this one thread.

A.g.e. isn't just the EQ newsgroup...it is also the community of people
who have been discussing/arguing together for years.  I suspect that folks
talking about forming a supergroup don't want just ANYONE in it...they
want their a.g.e. friends.  Hence it makes sense to me that he would ask
that question here.  If I want to ask my coworkers if they want to start a
volleyball team, I don't really go into the sports club and ask, do I?  

That said, I don't think a.g.e. is the place for general CoH
discussion...I've tried to keep any of my recent posts on it to those that
actually intersect with EQ or this NG, and I will continue to not discuss
CoH here.
