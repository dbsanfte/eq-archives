    Top end zones, like Kod'Taz and elemental planes, give about one AA per
hour in a standard XP group composed of characters capable of getting there.
Kiters can do better, but only in very limited areas. If mudflation keeps
going the way it is, I'd expect either the elemental planes to become
deflagged like most of the other PoP planes were, or zones to be made in the
newer expansions which give the same XP rate. Even without raid-level gear,
I would think 90 minute AA's would be very possible.
