Hmmm, well I am in lake of ill omen....I've tried grouping for continuous
pulling at goblin ruins, pillars and forts. In all cases at the moment as
a lvl 20 ranger I get more experience per time spent in game soloing
against goblins, minor skeles etc near the windmill than I do in a group
with one exception....in a full group including a cleric and one other
tank at least when pulling continuously..

I solo most of the time at the mo....I group for the fun and to
some extent loot items, not the xp. I expect it to get more difficult
soon.
