Hmm.  Its possible that there are mobs who are mitigating slow only a little
bit, such that its hard to tell.

Take three basic cases, though.

A) Mobs that don't mitigate, or mitigate only a small percent, say 0-30%.
Yes, I won't know the difference.  But at the same time, I really won't care
that mob X is being slowed by only 50% instead of 60%.

B) Mobs that mitigate around 50%.  Some may mitigate by 40%, others by 60%...
I won't know the difference.  I will, however, be able to see the difference
between a mob who is slowed by 60% and one thats slowed by only 30%.

C) Mobs that mitigate close to 100%.  Perhaps they aren't completely immune...
if the mitigate 70% or 90% of the slow, then they might as well be slow
immune, its not going to be obvious to me that they've been slowed at all.

Most mobs in POP zones fit in category A).  When pulled, they hit real hard
and real fast.  When slowed, their hit rate drops precipitously.  Some slowers
have hotkeys that announce a mob is slowed... when it really means they have
just cast.  Its very clear that the slow didn't stick though, from watching
the MA hp bar drop.

Some mobs in POP zones fit category B)  You can see that a slow has stuck, but
its obvious watching HP bars that it isn't doing the massively effective job
I'm used to.

Some mobs fit category C), there's no visible difference between slowed and
unslowed.  Are they mitigating 90% of the slow?  Could be.  Playing around
with the boss mob on the execution trial, people discovered that slows 50% or
under were working at more or less full effect, while slows over that were
apparantly having no effect at all.

Most of POP is amazingly free of lag, the exception I've found thus far is
POValor.  In Valor, turning the clip plane down to 20% or less takes care of
the lag.  In the other planes, I've been able to take the clip from my normal
80% up to full with no ill effects at all.

Well I almost never group without some form of slower in POP zones, and I can
tell you that I've seen very few mobs where slow wasn't working at all, in
fact, not all that many where slow was noticably mitigated.  Then again, its
possible that there are lots of mobs that DO perform this way... no sane
person spends a lot of time working exp on slow immune mobs that hit as hard
and fast as most POP mobs do, so maybe those are just encounters most people
don't do!
