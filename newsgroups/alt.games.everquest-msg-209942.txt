Yeah, but magelo isn't a hack so much as something which reads info 
ALREADY ON YOUR COMPUTER. Evidently everything like your stats, gear
as well as stuff in the bank is always loaded information.. just
sitting there in memory. So the magelo update just accesses that and
sends it to the magelo site, upon request.

So I think what he meant about people doing bad things, was a showeq
type program using his source. The stuff HE shows you isn't forbidden
stuff, it is just information about the character. As showeq has
shown, evidently lots of other things are also there but just not seen
by the client (such as location of ground spawns, spawns in the zone,
etc)

SOE already knows about these vulnerablities and how something like
showeq can spot them. Its just that the Jelan guy doesn't want
something with his code, which could get him blamed, being similar.
They've known about showeq for so long that they've even had chats
with some of the people who worked on it, as well as hiring at least
one of them (Rowyl I think)
