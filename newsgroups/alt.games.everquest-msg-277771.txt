Never understood why some items are marked LORE. If it's meant to be
some unique item (ignoring the fact other players have it also) that's
find but a gnoll ear? Every gnoll has two of them so why can't I have
more then one? And why can I trade them but not put them in my shared
bank? Doesn't make sense to me.
