"could" in that last statement simply means "allowed". Ie Trolls are 
allowed to group with high elves. Palis are allowed to group with SKs. 
The game doesn't enforce racial predjudices on player characters 
grouping choices.

There's a lot of things that you "can't" do as a level 1 newbie. From 
killing dragons to surviving the jump from kelethin to the ground. You 
are allowed to do those things, and its fair to say that players CAN do 
them, even if *YOU* can't.
