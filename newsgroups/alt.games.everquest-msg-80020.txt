PoG armour is on a par with Thurgadin armour (in reply to the person who
suggested PoG gear doesn't compare to Vel quest gear)

Faction..  you need CoV faction to
a) run through Western Wastes without agroing a zone full of dragons (hounds
are still kos)
b) to enter the HoT (Halls of Testing)
c) to quest the armour pieces from HoT

If you chose another wing, you need Kael faction in order to quest the
armour pieces that drop.

NToV is the toughest wing.. don't expect to ever get in a pickup raid of
nToV, let alone get anywhere near loot consideration.

One thing you should be weary of, loot drops are very small (perhaps 8 max
in a multi hour raid) and even then, in a pickup raid your not guaranteed to
be included.

An inexperienced raider can easily wipe out a ToV raid (like opening the HoT
door during a fight, pulling somebodies corpse)

Resists.. 100 fire and 100 cold unbuffed.  This is important, because at
your level you will resist very little.  Some of these AE's are big, and you
can't always hide from them.

I suggest you start joining a guilds Kael Arena raids, get used to them, how
they do raids, also get used to velious raids, because ToV is very likely
the toughest thing you will have faced yet in EQ.

I would say level 55 as a minimum level
