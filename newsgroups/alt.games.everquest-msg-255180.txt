The utterly huge fuckup SOE made with the raid vs. non-raid awards is
the total scale difference there now exists between the two.
Pre-Kunark raid stuff was nicer but not 1k AC 4k unbuffed HP nicer.
Devs had just gotten really retarted on giving out _stupidly_ powerful
upgrades for raiding and really really pitiful stuff for non-raiding
(with some exceptions, shawl is nice as was the Dain ring for it's time).
