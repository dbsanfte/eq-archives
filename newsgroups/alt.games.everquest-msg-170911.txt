Anyone who uses P2P clients/ fileshare tools, search on Everquest...

They are rife with "The best cheat!" or "Infinite plat!!1!" things.

Every one claims to have a 'secret' GM e-mail that they use to edit
characters, just send your login/password/character in a certain format
to this "special" e-mail address and you will get back your own
character's datasheet that you can edit and send back.

I started to report them to whatever mailhost the document contains to
have them shut down. But, I decided not to.

 Anyone stupid enough to fall for it, the game is better off without.
