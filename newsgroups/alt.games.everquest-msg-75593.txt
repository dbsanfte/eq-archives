Publicly humiliating them is also nice, like /shouting or /ooc'ing
something like, "(beggar's name), how can you even think of bringing
disgrace upon the Barbarian (or whatever) race by begging?  Go and

something like "Does anyone have anything to give to a newbie?" I'll
just say, "All I have to give is advice--don't beg!"
