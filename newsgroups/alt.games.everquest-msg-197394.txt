Our family-type guild also experienced some flagged/not-flagged schisms,
but not over the PoJ trials that everyone seems to be focused on.  The
trials are annoying and could certainly use some retuning (I like the
idea of the trials, but they're not very representative of the content
being reached), but we simply kept at it until everyone who wanted
through it had done so.  They didn't necessarily get it right away, but
nobody was left behind.

The flag that was the real problem for us was BoT.  The once-a-day
spawn of the minis, the 2+ groups necessary to take them down, and the
competition for them forced a raiding nature on us that we weren't
really comfortable with.  People didn't like logging on expecting to
do a bit of simple xp, only to be suddenly told "The forest minis are
up, get over to PoS!  Nownownow!"

Otherwise we've been more or less happy with the alternate flagging
quests.  We've gotten several groups flagged for Tactics that way, and
are starting on Torment and CoD.  The HoH flag quest looks annoying,
but we got lucky with a joint raid on Aerin'Dar.

That does still leave the 'casual' players though, who only play a few
hours every few days and don't want to spend them farming stupid
little spots for the key quests.  With the change to flag whole groups
though, we've been working on having the more 'hardcore' players
set up flagging groups for those who don't have the time.
