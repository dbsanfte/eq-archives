Thanks to all who replied,
I suppose I'd better get levelling then...
I have been arsing around trying to repeat my Steel shackle so I can keep
the Tynnonium one after the Whistling fists - already had my chat with teh
librarian in Kaesora (You lose the Tynn shackle, yes?) SO, can I get that
darned Ronin to spawn? I cannot. Been there for about a week. Made oodles o'
plat from SG's and their rarer drops. I expect at this rate Ill have fun
trying to get Raster, too... Already got to that bit of the softskin robes
quest!

Ah, well, just dinged 45th! Wish me luck - I'll get there some time this
year. I hope!
