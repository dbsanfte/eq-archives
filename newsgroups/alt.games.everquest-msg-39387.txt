The practice points are all the training you can do. The money up
there is how much it would cost to put each of those training points
into the skill. DON'T waste your money and points on skills like 1hs,
they go up naturally in combat. In fact, just about the only time you
should waste the points/money on a skill that goes up through use
(combat skills, sense heading, etc) is when you've fallen majorly
behind in the skill.
