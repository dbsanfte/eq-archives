It does have one major setback - defensive procs.  Spells like Lassitude 
provide people with defensive procs, which case an instant effect of 
some kind.  Lassitude is a slow + chance to self cast a heal over time. 
  Reptile skin is a heal, Sloth is a slow, etc.

Because warriors don't benefit from the hybrid no swing reset, every 
time the defensive proc fires, the warrior swing is reset.  Since the 
more mobs you have hitting you, the more chances your defensive proc 
have to fire, it's possible to reduce warrior swing rate to virtually 
nothing by engaging 10 to 15 mobs.

The bug has been pointed out to Sony, but as yet, no apparent fix is in 
the works.
