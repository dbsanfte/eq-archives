That's when they usually schedule patches. Prime time
for Aussie users. Count yourself lucky. :-)

(Seriously. Patches are normally scheduled for the
wee hours in the US, usually starting around 8pm
Sydney time and finishing 10pm-midnight Sydney time.
*Unscheduled* patches, on the other hand, happen
whever they happen; I assume VI only do such when
problems of a game-breaking nature need fixing.)

I'm not saying you shouldn't be peeved. I'm only saying
that there are those who have better reason to be so. :-)
