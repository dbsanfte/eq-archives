Why would anyone care about the enchanter animation on a raid in all 
honesty?  The only pets that most enchanters bother with on a raid are 
charmed pets.

All it takes for /pet back to not work is to not pay attention for a few 
moments, not worth the risk to the raid for the minimal damage 
contribution.

I have a pet, I don't have pet discipline, I don't use my pet on raids.  
Doesn't bother me in the least.
