I think you're in a good position PLing wise, but I haven't tried your class
combo specifically.  I don't know how strong SK pets are, but if you have it
attack something, then reclaim it or tell it to get lost before the mob is
dead, all of it's damage is wiped.  At low levels, you find one of the many
orc camps that are abandoned, pull a centurion/whatever, have your pet
almost finish it off, then have the druid finish it off. Alternately, you
can whip the mob, then FD and have the druid finish it off.  I found druids
to be very PL friendly because they get fairly potent, low-resist DoTs early
on in life (as compared to a cleric, for instance, who's nukes may be
frequently resisted if he attacks something a lot higher level than he is).
I'm wondering if this would work - 1. You engage the mob, 2. Druid DoT's it,
3. You beat mob down to a smidgen (has to be less HP than the druid did with
DoT/nuke),  then FD (wiping the aggro list), 4. You pop back up and finish
the mob off.  When you finish the mob off, I'm guessing that the druid will
get the xp because he has credit for more damage than you because of the FD
aggro wipe.
