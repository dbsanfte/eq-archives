I will second this.

The story is that for some reason EQ wasn't fully certified for XP,
so the XP operating shipped with an entry in its compatibility
database that basically says, "EQ may not alt-tab properly, don't
allow it".  But EQ actually is compatible, and going into the
compatibility database (via the free tool downloadable from Microsoft)
and turning *off* that "don't alt-Tab" entry for the "Everquest"
entry makes alt-tab work just great in EQ (like it does on all
non-XP Windows OS's).

I've done this on my XP machines, and it's great.  There will be no
need to "release" the mouse in order to alt-tab to/from EQ, and makes
it much faster and easier.

ADDITIONAL NOTE:  A secondary consideration is that EQ is a real
CPU hog, and trying to run anything else while EQ is minimized will
be an extremely sluggish experience, even on fast machines, because
EQ sucks up all the CPU cycles it can whether it really needs them
or not.  The solution to *that* problem is to download and run
"EqPlayNice" from the following website -- it can be run before or
after you kick off EQ, and it'll make EQ "play nice" with other
programs.  Among other things it lowers EQ's framerate when EQ
is in the background or minimized, freeing up lots of CPU time
for other programs to use when needed.  It also adds a handy
frame-per-second status line below the EQ "lag-bar", so that
you can see how many frames per second you're getting in EQ
under various conditions.  It can be found at:
