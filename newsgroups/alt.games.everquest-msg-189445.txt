You would think I'd be the same, being a software engineer.  But, other than
EQ, I use my computer for the following:

On line banking.  I use Quicken, but I've heard Money has surpassed Q in
ease of use.  Between on line bill paying and a VISA type debit card, I've
written maybe 10 paper checks in the last 2-3 years.  With my bank, there
are some minimal fees, but they are greatly overcome by the money saved on
postage.  Beyond that, the convenience is way worth it.

Taxes, email, news and newgroups, product research and purchases, photo
editing, woodworking designs, and upgrading software engineering skills.

Cheers,
Eric
