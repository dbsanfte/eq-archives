hello, earth to the sanjian.

I'm asking you to cite pussy used in this regard means something other than
what pussy cat does.  Thank you for showing that pussy cat means this, but
if you could manage to read, you'd know I've been saying this all along.

But getting from "pussy cat" to "pussy" is a hell of a long jump for you,
isn't it.

Heck no matter which way you guys twist you keep hitting the truth but are
too blind to see it.

Intellectual inadequacies, sure.

And your screaming it means so?  Heck I bow before the being with his head
up his mule's arse.

I've said where the words can be found, where exactly did you provide
anything other than screaming.    Here's a tissue, wipe that poo off your
face.
