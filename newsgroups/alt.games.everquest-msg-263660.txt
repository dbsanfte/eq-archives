Yeah this "indirection" thing mimics CoH's system and is very useful. Since 
you can't cast a favorable spell on an enemy, and you can't cast a 
detrimental spell on a friend, might as well make the system intelligent 
enough to realize that it you cast a heal on a mob, you really want that 
heal to apply to the mob's target. Conversely, if you cast a Smite on the 
MT, you really want that Smite to apply to the MT's target. Very handy.

Yep, no more Canni for my Shaman, only Mages get Canni now (Essence Shift, a 
spell that every Mage archetype gets at level 13). So all chanters, sorcs 
and summoners are going to be responsible for twitching the team.
