Thanks for the input, I'll look into those weapons and stick with my
WMBS for now.

My 2hs and 1hb are both 200, 1hs is 179 and 2hb is 105.  I just turned
50 so those skills were capped until last week.  I used Erandi to get
my 1hs and 2hb to 100 back in the 30's but didn;t think to use him
now.  Figured I'd kill him too fast for any real skillup attempts.

Thanks again.
