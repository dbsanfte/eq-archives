I read a response to this then came back just to emphasize the Harmony
aspect.  In my adventures up the ladder, often times I'd come across
incomplete pickup groups in North Ro for instance, that were just being hung
up by full Dervish Cutthroat camps they couldn't break without a wipeout.
My normal SOP was to run in and start harmonizing the camp then pull one
back for the waiting group to engage.  People catch on real quick when you
come running back, root park the mob in safe distance of them, then start
damage shielding the tanks.  I'd say 9 times out of 10 it wasn't 2 seconds
and someone in the group was asking for them to invite me or the leader was
doing an /invite themselves.

Druids rock really.  You zoom in, scope out the situation, and decide how
best to MacGyver(sp?) the situation.  Show 'em whatcha got.
