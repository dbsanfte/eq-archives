Not at the expense of everyone else, no. I'm not saying we're selfless
guardian angels, but we do understand social duty. You consider social 
duty an weakness.

Do you really think your band of hillbilly gun lovers (white cloaks or
no) are a match for your government? Come to think of it, the USA
already has armed stormtroopers posted nationwide - your police force.

A double decker bus was also found on the moon. It was in the papers. It
must be true. See, all those years of government propaganda have 
stopped you from *questioning* what you read. And anyway, if some Royal
twat (bear in mind that laws don't seem to apply to Royalty here, so
don't use the actions of the King to guage gun use) wants to get blown
up, great! Regardless, this was a long while ago. Move on.

Small fish, big pond. These things you are quoting are exceptions. By
and large, I can say "we don't have guns here" just fine. You're
muddying the issue, and you don't really get it.

Yeah. Millions dead can't be wrong. You are one dumb fuck.

What, there are less gun-related accidental deaths in the US than
pool related ones? I find that difficult to believe.

Yeah - those fuckin' ragheads had it coming, huh?

If the war is unjustified and *completely pointless* (Vietnam,
Afghanistan), yes.

I agree. But then, we did our warmongering a long time ago, when men
were men and governments were deranged - this is the 21st Century, and
as the world's only superpower you need to set an example of compassion
and understanding.

Yes. And you're an expert on Britain, evidently.

No argument here.

Farmers sometimes have shotguns. There aren't *that* many farmers. Do
the maths.

Great. Fuck off and take those hateful devices with you.

Another fun discourse about weapons with a citizen of the country which
gave us the A-Bomb. Thanks guys. Your opinion is most valued :P .
