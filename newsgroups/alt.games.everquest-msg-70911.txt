Well, there was some talk about this very topic a week or so ago, maybe
more. The consensus, so far as I can remember it, was that, as you said,
there was just 'something' missing. Personally, I'm playing both, but I've
only logged a very few hours in Camelot. I wonder sometimes if it
really -isn't- Evercrack (not that that statement addresses in any way the
issue here). I've played EQ since the game began, and I've always loved it,
even when I -hated- it... I always went back. (maybe I'm a sadist?) In some
ways, I find DAoC almost -too- easy. I worked -so- hard for everything I got
in EQ, and had to overcome so many stupid hurdles that don't, as your post
stated, apply in Camelot, that I think maybe in some part it actually IS the
amount of hard work. I always heard that you cared more about what you had
to work for. Maybe that's at least part of it in this situation. I dunno,
but I do know that the thought of giving up my characters in EQ is
actually -painful- in some way. I'm not sure I could make that statement
about DAoC, in 2+ years.

And of course, EQ does seem to be a more social game. Granted, I am only lvl
4 in Camelot, but so far, everyone who has tried to group with me simply
clicks the group button for me to accept/decline. No one has said one single
word to me, other than to run up to me and click that button. Naturally I
declined each time. If I'm going to group, it's going to be with someone who
has some semblance of social graces, and at least a modicum of dexterity
with the English language. Maybe that's part of it as well. A friend of mine
who belonged to a guild in EQ (lvl 57 Troll Warrior) has gone over to DAoC
and actually says he likes it better. I, for one, think that at least part
of that is the fact that he took most of his EQ guildmates with him, and
therefore had people he knew and was accustommed to to 'socialize/group'
with. And as I said before... I dunno.
