Soloing I did a lot of aggro kiting in PoD and PoN from 46-54. 
However some other places that have been ok experience, not metioned
yet:

-Undead in Nadox.  You can single pull the first three undead in the
left tunnel that heads to Hate's Fury.  They are going to be around
your level but with hard work, you can snare, slow, feign, send level
49 pet.  Heal with life flow and tap it back.  You will need to reslow
at least once.

-The Hole.  Already mentioned, however after 50, the golems after the
dropoff were crap experience.  Great for 49 and 50, pet tanking the
big huge golems downstairs.  However I wasn't impressed with the Hole
after that.  You can go further in but that means feigning or pet
tanking past those mean, unslowable (for necro's), high MR, see
invisible mobs before you get to the undead.  The undead are hard to
single and IIRC, cannot be pac'd at your level.  To get further in is
even tougher, with summoning, see invis, tough mobs all over the
place.  Keep a coffin in the bank and destroy your Paineel key if you
are going to do this.

-Maiden's Eye.  You can probably pet tank the undead mobs there. 
Moreover, I have had a lot of fun, at least at 55, charming the bats. 
They rarely resist, at least at 54 and 55.  Plus you can buff them up
and kill lots of other (higher level) mobs with them if you wish. 
Don't try without jboots or better of course.

-Go to Umbral Planes and group with the druid who is undoubtedly
camping the skeletons on the far side of the zone...whatever they are
called.  The ones that don't summon and drop Druid-only gear.  Pet
tank with his snare, your slow, his heals, and your dots or some
combination of this.  Or aggro kite.  I don't think you'll be able to
fear them.

-If you do try PoP, goos and lower level rats in PoD, trees, ravens,
etc in PoN.  Fear kite or aggro kite.  (Some mobs will be too high
level to fear in both zones, including the Planarean Larvae and some
rats in PoD, as well as trees and some ravens in PoN).  This will most
likely be your best experience, if a bit stale, fun-wise.
