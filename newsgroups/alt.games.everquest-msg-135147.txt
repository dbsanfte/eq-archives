As a follow-up to the start of this thread yesterday,
thanks for all the insightful observations.

And a new question for ya.

Suppose there are 4 chingaderas for sale:

Chinga_1 is 200
Chinga_2 is 250
Chinga_3 is 250
Chinga_4 is 50

So, seller 4 is lowballing for quick turnover.

Doesn't it stand to reason that some arbitrager could
buy-up the Chinga_4, then put it back on the market at
some higher price, thus sort of stabilizing the pricing?
