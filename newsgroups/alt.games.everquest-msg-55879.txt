Hello Everyone-

I have Been told this is possible?
I would like to Reorganize my spell book
i.e. change where spells are, and put them on a different page.

It would sure help save time and possibly death.

As you all know,.... my 39 seasons of learned Ranger spells are
overwelmingly hard to keep organized....  hehe

Thank you for any help.

    -Kris.
