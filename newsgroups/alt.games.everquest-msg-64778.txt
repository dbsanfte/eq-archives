My machine is...
AMD Athlon 1.4Ghz
7zx-h Gigabye mobo
512 mb 133 ram
Radeon VE (32 mb DDR RAM)
Its actually funny, with DX 8, its slower in the old texture zones than the
new ones.. (i overwrote the patch's version of tox with the new one and
tried it out), and Luclin was a little choppy in the city. Also, I at the
select screen, there was a pause when the character model changed to
something never displayed before, and the new character menu took about 20
secs to load when clicked... im gonna mess with my ram and see if cacheman
can fix it or if its causing it.. anyways, yeah you should be all set, just
get your latest drivers
