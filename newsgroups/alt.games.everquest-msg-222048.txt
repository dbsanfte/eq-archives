Yes, but you can usually go in and give an OOC asking if anyone is willing
to let you loot ones off their kills if you can't get a group.  Also, make
sure your tailoring is well above what you've read for skill level for
combining on the last combine.  I've failed twice now... The first time with
a skill of 130 and the second time with 165 Probably just bad luck but
having to collect all these threads and bile again is getting old... lol
