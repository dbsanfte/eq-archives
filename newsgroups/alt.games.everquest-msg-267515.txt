If you have the numbers it's a good and proven tactic. But I offer a
different approach for raiding MB with smaller numbers. When my old
guild did MB we were only 34 people there. We set up the spider groups
and started to kill them. when MB became targetable the MT and one bard
got into the MB chamber. Two clerics were holding the MT with fast heals
and we used ranged dps to kill MB. The bard did not get any heal for the
whole fight but didn't have any problems there. It was a flawless kill
and since we kept the spiders killed the whole time it was easy to pull
the gnome outside the room and announce loot.

Since we were not in VT the gear of our guild was at Velious/SSRa/LDoN level.
OoW wasn't out then so it's quite doable with a even smaller raid force.
Just make sure your raid knows what it should do.
