Perhaps... but he's not merely 'content'... he's 'engaged'.

There's 'content'... and there's 'engaged' and there's 'burnt out'. Most 
people cycle between them with some regularity. At 'burnt out' if theres 
something with a good hype going on people will try it... at 
'content'... they'll try it if friends are doing it...

At engaged... yeah ... they probably don't remember to eat properly 
either :) nevermind pay attention to the competition.

... move that same player forward 3 weeks...

plug away at that event for a month... maybe a month in a new game is

I've always beleived wearing the fact that you've put up with idiocy as 
a badge of honor was categorically stupid.

There's a beautiful critism of Disney's Cinderella that essentially 
tears the little wench to pieces for being utterly unassertive and 
terrible role model to women; and it concludes by condemning the moral: 
"You will be rewarded if you sit there and take grave injustice quietly".

Cinderalla was wrong to put up with what she endured quietly; a person 
has an obligation to stand up for themselves. If she wants to wear her 
passiveness as a badge of honour too she's just compounding the error in 
my opinion.

That *really* depends on the game. But yeah its true enough the recent 
crop of titles.

The bugs were dreadful for the first guilds that saw it. But yeah... one 
of EQs strengths is its extreme difficulty at the endgame. New titles 
just don't seem to have the guts.

Personally, though, I hate EQs endgame... as a dev I'd have no wish to 
put players through that guild/level grinder to see it. I think 
monstrously difficult encounters tailored to smaller groups would make a 
large part of the game more accessible to players. **and restrict it to 
smaller groups** to prevent zerging and other win-by-numbers 
strategies... a la Gates of Discord 1 group missions... and LDoN (at 
least in theory)...

Large raids have their place... and the players that want them deserve 
to have them... but it shouldn't accomplished by punishing more casual 
players with few interesting equipment upgrades they can obtain, and 
putting them on a cash farming treadmill to get the powerplayers scraps.

I beleive a game should be completeable by any person, the less you play 
the longer it takes... i don't care if it takes them 10 years to do 
it... it just has to be doable. EQ fails in that regard imo.

Yup. No doubt.

/shrug

At this stage its true.

In earlier stages it was less true... lower hardware-cost more than 
anything drove intel sales in the early years.

Circa 1985 the 386 was introduced... by then DOS was already entrenched 
in the business/accounting enviros. Backwards compatibility was already 
a concern... the value of a GUI wasn't really recognized for said 
business/accounting enviros... and there was a hefty price/performance 
premium to get a GUI at that point.

Those 3 combined to perpetrate the sales of lower cost/ defeatured PCs 
(no sound... minimal graphics... DOS 3 & wordperfect......

Not to mention DOSes better integratability into existing unix/terminal 
infrastructures. You don't need a GUI for a dumb unix terminal... and 
there was still that transition going on.
