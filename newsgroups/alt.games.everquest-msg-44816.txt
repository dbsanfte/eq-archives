ALthough this is helpful, a step in the right direction, it isn't
necessarily a comprehensive list of the current ZEMs in
place.

I suppose its possible that this is indeed the end all be all
list of ZEMs, but it isn't clear that it is so, it -says- that its
just a list of increases.

Presumably the concept of ZEM predates this upgrade,
and there are old zones that have a positive (heck, even
a negative) ZEM.

Further, some of these zones may have already had
a positive (or negative) ZEM, the way this is worded.
Is the current ZEM for the Hole 30%?  10%?  The
missive you quote isn't clear on that, just that its 25%
better than it used to be.

Also, it dates back to the patch where they increased
this block of ZEMs, doesn't mention any more
recent changes (such as the LOIO ZEM Nerf I'm
told has happened.)

Can't imagine noone has compiled this list yet... but
I guess if noone has it would be worth digging around
in EQAtlas and doing the leg work sometime.  Maybe
next patch day when I'm stuck not playing, eh?
