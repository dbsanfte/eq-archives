Can't say for the enchanter ones, for the equivalent shaman spells, 
ranger/pally/sk can keep a mob on them, even if I malos on incoming, and 
slow as soon as the gems refresh.  A warrior usually has to work a bit 
harder, and it's hit or miss with them.  Heck, if I skip malos, and just 
slow, they can generally keep the mob from ever touching me.  SK 
snare/dot is very high aggro, pally stuns are high aggro, and prevent 
attacks for a short period.

I do know that slow will pull a mob off an enchanter that tashed, unless 
that enchanter is already too low on health from being smacked a couple 
times...
