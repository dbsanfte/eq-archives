I was medding on the platform in North Ro last night after a fight with 3 
mummies that left me diseased, low health, and totally out of mana.  A 
friend asked me if I would give her a lev spell (she's addicted, I swear 
to god - everytime I group with her, "please please pleeeeeeeeeeeeeease 
can you lev me again? <levs her> WHEEEEEEEEEEEE I'M FLYING") so I said 
"you'll have to wait a minute" and told her that I needed to a) cure 
myself b) heal myself and c) med to full mana.  She said okay and went 
off to fight something while waiting.  Meanwhile a total stranger saw me 
healing myself and ran up and said "can I have sow plz?"

Me: No.
Him: Why not?
Me: Because I'm already low on mana. (Didn't bother explaining since I 
figured it wasn't his business and he'd probably ask for more of an 
explanation anyway)
Him: Okay, thanks anyway.
Me: <sits in shock for a second>
Me: Wow, thanks for not pushing.  Say, if you give me a minute to med up 
I'll give you a SoW anyway.  As a thanks for not pushing and all.  Heck 
I'll throw in lev too if you want it.
Him: No, SoW will do, I realize you're low on mana.

Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.  Best spell-beg experience in game so far.  If you're 
reading, kid, thanks.

I've done the armor thing several times in Halas, because there are so 
many bears wandering around.  I buy the patterns, approach a naked 
newbie, and tell them that if they'll bring me ruined bear pelts I'll 
make them some newbie armor.  Meanwhile I hunt for the L/M/HQ pelts, and 
when he gets a few pelts he sends me a tell and we meet at the newbie 
ramp.  I also turn in the polar bear pelts and gob necklaces still, and 
give away the armor and equipment I get that way, as well (that tunnel 
from Halas to Everfrost was HELL the first time, with no light source 
whatsoever, and no way to make money for a torch except to get out there 
and kill something... so the torches I get from the warrior arena are 
usually very quickly chosen by newbies :) )
