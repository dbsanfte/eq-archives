Number 2 is pretty much the definition of Skill. In EQ, the higher level 
you go, the more efficient and knowledgeable you have to be about your 
class to succeed. You can call it what you want, but it does, in fact, 
boil down to skill. The more skilled players will see/do more in EQ and 
accomplish it with fewer people and in less time.
