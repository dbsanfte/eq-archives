that's always a prob, being frontrunner in guild. Either get alliances with
other guilds to do some combined things or, less desirable, swap guilds.

Frustrating... send tells to help you with trial. Make friends with them
maybe you can get the ppl who ask you to get to PoV to help you.

why not giving others in your guild time to catch up with you and you
benefiting extra abilities etc. etc. once they are there in reach of lvl. In
my guild the we got 3 lvl 60+ and now quite a few 55+ except for the cleric
none has done PoV trial yet. But clerics make friends that want to help them
mostly quite easy :-) For the rest the other high lvls help out fellow
guildies every now and then, and work nicely on their aa not to get ahead
too far. So there are many things you can do and as long as you are having
fun it doesn't really matter if you ding. (or hear the trumpets for that
matter)

happy hunting
