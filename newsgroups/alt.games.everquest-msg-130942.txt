Ryou I understand your points, they are valid up until the point of
going though it yourself. With all those druids out there this is one
of the reasons no ones plays them in the higher level game. Its a
common problem and basically I mean "IF" they dont listen to a valid
complaint. 

 As for being a prima donna heck the chars missing out on drops due to
this situation. The whole point of a raid is fun and drops which he is
missing out on both. 

The problem of letting people know your alts name is that you will get
tells for ports anyway, trust me I did. When the habit of sending you
a tell for a port is broken let them know your alts name but be firm
if ya get a tell for "hey I need a port", answer is Im playing here
and cant leave.

I have asked for ports from the guild once to get to a raid and then I
offered payment, otherwise I do what everyone should be doing, get
your own port.  Now I have noticed my new guild doesnt treat druids or
wizzies in this matter although they do it out of the goodness of
their heart sometimes. 

Now evac from a raid is different and I gladly accept help in that
department, with thanks that is. 

This guy is being abused he has the right to play his game too.

BTW a lot of those "friends" I had as a druid went away when I stopped
porting. Funny how you NEVER hear from some people till they want (not
need) help. Found out who my friends really were and glad of it too.
