Somehow, this debate reminds me of my dad.  Whenever I get some new device 
or other, I read the manual.  Then I have some clue how to work the 
device.  Then my father tries to work the device and does it wrong, so I 
show him how.  "How'd you know how to do that?"  He asks.  "I read the 
manual."  "Jeez, reading manuals... didn't I teach you -anything- as a 
kid?"

It's basically the standard male refusal to stop and ask for directions, 
in different clothing.

But add me to the 'I like manuals' category.  Good manuals are really 
really helpful.  And sometimes the bad manuals actually make it to the 
'funny' category, in a Plan 9 From Outer Space kind of way.

In-game help is nice, too.  But I like manuals.
