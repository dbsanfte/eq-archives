I used to be afraid to run Kithikor at night, but at level 5, it is probably
almost as dangerous during the day as at night.  Recently I have made the
run a number of times with my teen level characters, at night, with no
incident.  Stay high up on the wall, keep an eye out for any nasty mobs, and
you should be fine.
