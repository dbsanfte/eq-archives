ROFLMAO....

Pathetic. I guess its only fair though. Their is no objective media... 
just fanatics on both sides. The truth falls somewhere in the middle... 
and between Bowling and Moorelies.com its still pretty clear that 
America has serious gun use issues.

I don't have to argue these assertations...there are none that need 
refutation. The arguments on this site are about as biased as Bowling 
was, as any media is. (And most of the arguments were trivial too... I 
know I can figure out per capita rates from absolute numbers...) All 
documentaries are biased... simply choosing who's story to tell in the 
first place is biased. Deal with it.

If you are such an idiot as to take Moore at face value then I pity you. 
The rest us are quite aware that what he says, what any media says, 
needs to be taken with a gain of salt.

For what its worth though, contrary to what your little site claimed, I 
think Heston came off as a rascist because he credited the constitution 
to the 'smart white guys' who wrote it in the interview.

No clumsy history behind it, no 'he was referring to events in the 
past', no mitigating nothing. It is simply striking that Heston felt the 
need to point out they were white isn't it? Odd that this would be a 
'relevant adjective' isn't it? I know it would never occur to me to 
point out what colour they were, particularly in passing like that, 
where their race wasn't even a topic of discussion... but that's just me.
