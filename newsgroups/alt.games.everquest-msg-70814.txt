AHA!
:-)
Don't know why, but it reminds of back when gucomics was still running
Woody's EQ strip. It was during the time when Verant was making a big
deal out of banning any account they felt may have been compromised. A
GM is talking to a naked Necro.

GM: "Your account is being banned for being hacked."
Necro: "What? I never reported my account as being hacked!"
GM: "It's obvious. You're a level 49 necro and your naked. Your account
has obviously been hacked."
Necro: "I'm on CORPSE RUN!"
GM: "LIAR! Necros never die. I banish you to Shadowbane, INFIDEL!!"
