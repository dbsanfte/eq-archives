I had something similar happen in Rivervale. I no longer go anon or
role because people ask anyway. I have a new strategy now that seems
to work, I say "no." This works wonders though most people in game no
longer know how to handle it. You have to be firm, what I said was

"No, and you can simply run straight down along the zone wall from
rivervale to the zone to WC by waiting until daytime"

"no I can't, I'm level 11 and would die." 

"Not if you do it the way I said, which I'd have no problem doing at
level one, without the sow that I gave you." 

They still insisted they needed a port which I would not give them
and continued their dance into misty and rivervale asking in channels,
while I laughed at them to myself. I could have made this run back and
forth at level 1 over 1000 times in the time that they wasted. I
refuse to help those who won't help themselves when they can.

Besides saying no, even if I decide to port someone I'll never re port
them. They are just not careful enough.

Jeez you are a giving person, I'd have told all those people "no."
Ahaha. I can't understand you being in the middle of doing something
and stopping over and over to TRADE DOWNTIME with lazy assed people.
This is what you are doing. All of them could do these things
themselves with minimal downtime while instead you are taking up all
their combined downtime for them.

Of course, this is why I innitially say

"no."

That is why "no" works better than making speeches. They will usually
ask "why?" and I simply won't answer.

No, they expect them because druids like you give them to them.
If you always get something for free you both stop overly thanking
people or offering them money. Join the club of the people who don't
put up with this crap anymore. Eventually you'll be like me and say
that you are the president ;)
