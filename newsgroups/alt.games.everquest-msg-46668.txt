That's actually correct, if you live in a more or less northerly 
location... Most places in the US are at a very low latitude (heck, the 
south of Canada is more or less in line with the north of Spain), but in 
the UK I've seen the kind of light you see in EQ at 4am at around 3am, and 
that was in London, which pretty much the southern tip of the country. In 
Scotland in the summer I could pretty much read a newspaper all day around, 
except for a short period around 1am.
