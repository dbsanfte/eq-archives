Fishing in Abysmal was working just a few weeks ago, it got broken 
sometime between my maxxing baking, and a few days ago.

Natimbi is generally safe, until some idiot trains the magus camp.  Mobs

and fish to your hearts content.  The mobs you will find that people 
generally drag to the zone in will not see through that.
