No, actually, I do.  As I said, I had, until Friday, no evidence that 
there was an 'accepted standard'.  That evidence is shaky... One 
netiquette guide, when I can find 3 that don't adress the issue easily, 
and nothing in the RFC's that I'm aware of.  I was also unaware it annoyed 
anyone except Ben Sisson in this thread: http://tinyurl.com/2ekro , in 
which you will see, a couple posts down, he acknowledges that I may as 
well keep what I had.  He also noted that Agent does recognize characters 
other than '>' as legitimate quote markers by default, which further 
speaks against the existence of a standard.  Specifically, ']', '|', and 
':' pass Agent's 'is it a quote marker?' test.

>HAHAHAHAHA YOU ARE EXACTLY LIKE ME YOU HYPOCRITE.

Well, not quite exactly like.  We're both presumably carbon based, but my 
.sig is shorter.  And I'm willing to change my ways when I find that they 
bother people.  If you're so anxious to prove I'm exactly like you, you 
might try following my example. :)

*Shrug*  My indiscretion drew two complaints total since March 1, 1996 
when I started using it.  It sounds like many more than that disliked your 
intro line enough to say something, not to mention your .sig.  Make of 
that what you will.

No, actually, it isn't.  Pretty much every netiquette guide, and even the 
RFCs suggest the virtue of shorter .sigs.  That would make it nearly the 
exact -opposite- of .sigs.
