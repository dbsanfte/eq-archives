I understand this, which is why I said I can see why some prefer points, 
and why most successful guilds DON"T use a random system.

But that said, -I- prefer a random system.  Impractical it may be, but 
I'm not necessarily practical.  What I'd really like to see would be a 
weighted random system, where your odds vary based on something like 
accumulated points, but you always have at least -some- chance of 
winning any given roll.  I've written a few example systems, and could 
probably think of a dozen more.  Can't seem to find a guild interested 
in switching to one to see how it works out, though.

Oh, and you've come up with a terrible example for your cause for me, as 
my cleric pushed hard to get into ST, for two reasons: 1) raiding with 
melee with prismatic weapons means more power for the raid, things die 
faster, less healing needed.  2) wanted his own prismatic weapon (and 
got one), as cleric melee is by far the most efficient soloing tool we 
have, in the post summoned hammer era, and between the 25 dex on the 
hammer, the 75 dex on yaulp V, and an avatar proc his dex caps out, and 
the proc rate (which is the only important thing about cleric melee 
output) is astounding

Almost everyone I see uses at least this much weight in a 'random' 
system: once you win something you are thru rolling for the duration of 
that run, unless its for something really really major like an epic 
drop, while you previously won a yard trash drop.

A down side of points systems, by the way, is that items which are minor 
upgrades to people often Rot, because nobody wants to waste points on 
them.  A bunch of minor upgrades adds up to a major upgrade... but more 
to the point, I don't think there's anything gets in my craw more than 
rotting items, come on, got to be -someone- here that could use it! 
Next time lets invite some guests, if we're all so well equipped.
