On my 36th Eru Wiz, I added points to all my specialization when I first got
the option.  One point to each.  Now I read that the first spell class to
get to 50, becomes your specialization.  Most of my Specs are above 150 now
and I'm not sure which one got there first.  I'm hoping my Evocation was the
first, although its my second highest Spec.  Is there a way to find out what
your Specialization is?  I've also read about the quest you can do to reset
your Specs so I'll do that if my Spec is something else besides Evocation.

Thanks!
