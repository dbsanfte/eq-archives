Hush, I have 800 pp to my name and now you're making me depressed :)

Level 1 warriors in crafted, sure... but I don't think I'll ever see
the day when twinking a lvl 1 with cobalt is common. Even with the
increasing number of people in the extreme highlevel range, not every
player is in a guild capable of getting the very best loot. Granted,
those who can do it *will* more than likely be making ubertwinks, but
you'll still have more than enough of your patchwork/bronze/banded
newbies.
