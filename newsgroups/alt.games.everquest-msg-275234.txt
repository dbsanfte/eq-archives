Heh, it's the market that drives the business. It's not like most quasi-
burned-out EQ old-timers want to revisit the old content, new look or not. 
That would have been interesting for about 10 minutes, I would wager. 
Besides, then the gripe would have been something along the lines of, "I 
can't believe they slap some makeup and a new dress on the same old zones 
and call it an update!"

I'm all in favor of revamping the old zones, but not at the expense of new 
content.
