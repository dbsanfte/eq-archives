There are things that in-house testers won't find, but that will be
found when 90000 players play.  Consider that EQ has 15 different
classes now.  You can't really expect in-house testing to actually try
each class, can you?  That's why subtle bugs, like bard songs being
completely broken, aren't found until the paying players try them.
