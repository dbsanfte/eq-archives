While I'm obviously on the side of those-not-smoking-crack on this 
thread, I really don't understand what you mean by that. There's lots of 
lines out there, and you draw them wherever your conscience dictates. 
When it comes to eating, I draw the line between animals and plants, not 
between humans and animals. When it comes to killing, I draw the line 
between dangerous and non-dangerous. When it comes to attraction, the 
line encloses only human females in a particular age bracket. That you 
can draw an arbitrary line between humans and animals doesn't mean you 
are free of moral and ethical responsibilities to them.
