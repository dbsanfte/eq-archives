One thing I found was that as a wizard, I ended up melee'ing a good bit up 
until level 10 or so, so I didn't have so much downtime. I would drop a 
nuke or two on a mob and then finish it off with my modest dagger attacks. 
If you just unload your entire mana bar and then sit to regen it back, it's 
gonna be a long road. After level 10 or so, you can start getting into 
groups and it's easier to pace yourself.
