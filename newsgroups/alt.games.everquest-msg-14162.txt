 Skyshrine is laid out fairly nice. The 60's can hunt there but that's
deeper in. The gargoyles and such are green at 60 which I guess puts
them below level 46. Maybe lower since I don't know when they start to
go green. I'd say 45 is a fairly good level to go in there to do things
up to the ramp with the two jello cubes.
