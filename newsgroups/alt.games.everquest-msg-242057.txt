I'm not sure if this is a regular functionality or a bug, but...

Last night, Claviger and I were in PoK, about to port through the Overthere
stone. He was playing around and running into the stone while we were
chatting on the phone, and was telling me about how when he did that, once
in a while it would spin him around and push him back a few game-feet.
Thinking this was weird, I did the same thing, ran into the Overthere
stone...and suddenly found myself cast far away, over by the soul binder,
with 656 points of falling damage! When I told him this, of course he had to
try it out for himself, but he just got the same effect he'd been getting. I
tried it again, after I ran back to the stone, but couldn't reproduce the
effect.

Anyone else had this happen?
