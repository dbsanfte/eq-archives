I'm playing it on 1920x1200 on a 23" LCD.  Very sharp and no real noticible 
performance degradation over lower settings.

The only resolutions I've found that work with widescreen are 1920x1200 and 
1280x768.  For me, the 1920x1200 is very sharp and clear, but the 1280x768 
is extremely fuzzy.  Not sure why since all other resolutions are rather 
sharp, if not wide screen.  The text is a bit small at the higher 
resolution, but considering the speed boost of the lower res is minimal in 
my experience, I'll go with the better graphics over eye strain.  At least 
the text in the chat dialogs can be resized, even if the quest journal text 
can't.
