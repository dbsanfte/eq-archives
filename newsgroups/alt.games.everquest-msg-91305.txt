So, snicker away, but I'm actually up for some serious thee and thou
roleplaying here, and would prefer to have a smaller d00d count than I'm
seeing on the main servers.  On the other hand, I'm not up for a $40/mo
fee.

Firiona Vie sounds like the perfect solution, but the one time I tried it
(Dwarf Warrior), there was one other person in my starting zone on
Saturday afternoon.

Is FV always this desolate, or are dwarves just not very popular?  What
race would be suggested where I could actually see people while pounding
through my first few levels?

Geo
