Can u tell me what exactly i am doing wrong here?Is there something against 
the law here to trade "virtual" money from one game to another?Common those  
things we are playing are call "games"(u remember what is it right?..its 
not real life....its ...a game!)

so yeah i still want to trade cash in daoc for cash in eq.i dunno who it 
will hurt anyway.
