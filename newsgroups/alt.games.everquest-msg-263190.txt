At 65 the Stalkers are still mostly dark blue to me. Since I could lock 
down the whole camp easily, it was my preferred spot for AA xp... except 
for the fact that my brain would run out of my ears after a couple of 
hours or so.

With my level of equipment, and soloing, I can't think of any higher-
level mobs that wouldn't hand me my ass on a platter -- or at least, 
make trying to xp off them an exercise in pain. Things may have changed 
with GoD and OoW, I can't say I've played either much.
