Greetings,

I'm trying to find a repeatable method of getting through Chardok to the Halls of Betrayal
(Chardok B).

Despite having been in the game for almost 5 years, I've never been in Chardok or Chardok
B.  But my interested is piqued since, at the moment, it's a hot spot for 60+ characters
(and an undead dungeon to boot!).

I've read that you can stage yourself at the steps in the loop in Chardok, at the ZI.
Then, when you're ready, you pop DA and run to the bridge, jump down, swim through a
waterfall, and click the lever in the Chardok B zone alcove.  A DA-train is always a good
time!

Unfortunately, the instructions which I found for this technique leave much room for
interpretation by those who are unfamiliar with Chardok (/raise).  Adding to the mess is
my failure to find any maps worth the (virtual) paper which they were written on.

Undeterred, I took my 61 PAL over to Chardok, and sat staring at the stairs in the ZI
loop.  After a while, a Mage and his buddy came through and I asked if they would show me
the way.

We cleared to the bridge and jumped off the near right-side of the bridge.  Then we
cleared our way NE.  Eventually the Mage said that we were close enough, and it would be
easier to CoH me to the Chardok B alcove.  Before I could suggest differently, he invised,
and CoH'd me to the alcove.

Shrugging, I clicked the lever, and voila! - undead for days, as far as the eye could see.
Truly my idea of heaven!  I need to LIVE here for a while.

But there are problems.  My single experience with one of the Chardok B ZI MOBS shows that
my PAL is not strong enough to solo in the zone; he will need assistance from my 65 CLR
and my 57 ENC if he is to survive.

The first problem is that, because of the CoH, I never learned how to get to Chardok B.  I
can't get the other toons in there if I don't know the path.

The second problem is that I didn't see the waterfall when we jumped off the bridge.  It's
possible that my gracious guide did not know about the DA-train technique.

I've done some careful exploring in Chardok, around the alcove, and I've found the
waterfall, and I've swam through it.  But I can't for the life of me figure out where the
bridge is, above me.  It looks like solid rock up there.  That being said, I haven't swam
too far from the waterfall.

So my question is...did we jump down on the wrong side of the bridge, the wrong end of the
bridge, or off the wrong bridge altogether?

Best regards,

Tim ==
