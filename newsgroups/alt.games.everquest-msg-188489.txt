I'm guessing this would be for the 22 beastlord

The 2 anecdotes first. When my troll beastlord dinged 22 (pre-PoP), I spent
about 6 hours chain-fizzling Sicken and Summon Drink and medding on the
OT docks. The relatively low wisdom (about 100) and the lack of any mana
regen buffs made for an incredibly boring and frustrating time.

A month or so ago, my dark elf shadowknight dinged 22 and got his first
evocation spell. I took a totally different tack. Went up to bazaar, bought
as much cheap int gear as I could afford. Spent about 75pp for about +30
int. Spent another 20pp on KEI and Intellectual Superiority. Spent training
points to go from 9 to 30. *Then* sat at Shadowhaven pool and chain cast
Ward Undead. Maxed it in about 30-45 minutes. Was hardly a blip on the
frustration meter.


Suggestion #1: Look for cheap, sucky gear that has int/wisdom on it. Stuff
you would never wear while adventuring, because you'll only use this for
skill ups and tradeskills. Stuff like splitpaw gloves, belt of dwarven
skulls, BBQ erudite, whatever. Everyone's got their charisma gear for
selling loot, why balk at wis/int gear for major skill ups? Hit up the
buff-pushers in Nexus for KEI. Then go find somewhere quiet and non-laggy
to practice.

Suggestion #2: Don't get discouraged. Up to about 50 or so, my SK was only
getting 2-5 skill ups per mana bar. At about 75, I was getting 10-15 per
mana bar. *Most* of your mana at the lower skill levels goes to fizzles,
which you don't get any skill ups from! The improvement curve over time
is *very* nonlinear.

Suggestion #3: (Assuming we're talking about your beastlord here...) It
seemed more efficient in practice to cast Sicken (L15) than Summon Drink
(L22), even though Sicken costs 3 times the mana -- at least up to about
Conjuration(70) or so. Sicken fizzled noticeably less than Summon Drink,
so there were more skill up attempts per mana bar.


In hindsight, even taking into consideration the hour trip from OT to Nexus
(via NK) and back, I think it would have been much faster to take my troll
BST to Nexus for a KEI to catch up in Conjuration.

Hope this helps!
