Last night I tried to hand over about 40 Gnoll fangs to the guard captain 
in Qeynos, but even though I killed over a few hundred gnolls already, they 
still hate my guts in Qeynos, so I persuaded a friendly Shaman to make me 
invisible and there I went into Qeynos with my big fat butt.

Once I started handing out the Gnoll fangs one by one, I just noticed a 
small message appearing, "You appear" and I was slashed for 392 damage, and 
kicked for 286 damage. Needless to say, a poor lvl 9 troll doesn't survive 
that kind of beating.

Now I wondered, because I did the exact same thing with my Erudite 
necromancer. I cast Invisibility (Some shrouding lvl 8 spell) and handed 
over all the fangs, while the captain was indifferent. That went very well, 
and beside the faction bonus, I gained two levels as well (This was at 
level 11 with about 60 Gnoll fangs).

Now is there a substancial difference between a Shaman invisibility spell, 
and a Necro's, or Did I just miss the "You feel yourself starting to 
appear" mesaage with my Troll ??

Thanks in advance.

P.S.
If there's a way to stay invisibel while turning in the fangs, I 'd like to 
hear about it :-)
