    And yet, from DAY ONE, monks have had the best mitigation and been near
the top in terms of AC. A pre-Kunark monk was like this, and it was
considered balanced then. Why is it no longer balanced? What changed between
pre-Kunark and today that made a monk having as good, if not better defense
than a warrior imbalanced?

    HPs changed. Right around the time a guild starts doing NToV, monk HPs
start to approach warrior HPs and a CH becomes close to being equally
efficient on both. So why the hell would you nerf the AC on monks level 50
and below if the real problem starts with NToV gear?

    Now this is secondhand to thirdhand information, so don't shoot me if
this is off. But last night one of our guild monks said his monk friend on
Test reported losing 37% of his AC with the new nerf. That's massive, and
totally uncalled for.

    The stuff that monks get from NToV is mostly the Wyvern Hide armour.
Hide. LEATHER. It was INTENDED that they wear this stuff. Certainly the
armour doesn't have +MANA, INT, or WIS on it to imply it was caster gear.
Or, to flip the question around: list the monk-only stuff from top-end
Velious. Look at the stats, like on the AoW pants. Tell me what was
"intended".

    If you want to know what was originally intended for monks, go back and
look at the pre-Kunark defensive skill caps. They'll show you that this is
the way it was meant to be. Best choice of non-CH tank, but no ability to
instantly turn aggro onto themselves.
