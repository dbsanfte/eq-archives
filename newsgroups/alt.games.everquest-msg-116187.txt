My bad.  I'm not a Linux/Unix/BSD/RedHat/Whatever guy really.  To me,
they all kind of meld together.

Like I said, I don't have a problem with Microsoft's actual products.
I have more of a problem with how they do business.  That's why I'd
like to see Bill and the boys faced with some serious competition.  It
would make the products I like to buy better.
