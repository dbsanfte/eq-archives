hey hun, do SkyFire mountains enough and youll get it. My 51 necro
looted it off of a named mob there (pulled by the ranger who can
see them half a zone away). Since youve been doing uber places like
DN i dont need to splain the difficulty with summoner mobs but hey..
spells like Succor and Forlorn Deeds are worth it. My problem with
SkyFire is that I have to solo cause noone wants a necro in a group
(unless theyre begging for a corpse summon) and without jboots, running
back to my pet after darkening an Ancient Wurm then getting a killer
sperm add can really get you wound up! Get a small group there (a druid
and necro combo would be perfect) and farm away!

my skyfire list so far:

upheaval
reckoning
tears of druzzil (i think thats the name)
circle of winter
circle of summer
succor

i gave away or sold the rest so i cant remember. oh, how much do you
think succor is worth? i didnt know at the time cause i didnt have a
druid and sold it to someone who offered 700pp for it. Now that i have
a druid and can see how important it is i would pay more than that.
