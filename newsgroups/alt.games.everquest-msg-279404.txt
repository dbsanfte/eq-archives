Yes, along with their comparably equipped guildmates.  Hell, sometimes I've
wondered how they manage myself, but I give them credit for it all the same.

Of course the reason that wouldn't happen is because if you have that much
time to spend in the game, you might as well raid and get the full enjoyment
out of it.  =P

Abysmal Sea, Barindu, Ferubi, Natimbi, Qinimi, Riwwi, 4 sewers zones, Tipt,
Vxed, all accessible from the start.

KT, Ikkinz, Yxxta all available to single groupers.

Qvic, Inktuta, Txevu, and Tacvi are locked away.

Just because you only went to three zones doesn't mean that's all there
were.  =)

Of course they were raid-whines.  That's what I do.  Monk mitigation was
high on my list.  Ask any single-grouper monk what he thinks of that.  =P

To be fair, when talking about a guild *just* getting to the Ikkinz trials
at 65, it was more like half a dozen wipes.  And that may be an
understatement.

Of course most of the people that begged out tried to beg in later when they
realized where all the earrings and rings were coming from.  =)  I've found
item links can inspire many people in a game that rewards goal oriented
play.

Hell, every active monk on my server is "younger" than me I think (dunno on
some of the Quellious natives).  Some people have an easier and/or faster
path, some have harder.

The groups, yes.  The individuals, probably not nearly so rare.  The ability
to pull together a group (or a guild) is a fairly rare commodity itself. 
There was a time when I considered it daunting.  After being in guild
leadership for years and years I actually find it fun.   =)

No, I mean the stuff I see on the vendors.  For time investment, you will
have enough time to farm up 250k/slot for a couple of the weaker slots that
will leave you (or realize that you could look outside DoN for some slots).
