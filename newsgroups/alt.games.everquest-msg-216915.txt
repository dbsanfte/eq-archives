Ahh, you were referring only to when you first get the adventure and not as
a matter of course.  That's fine.  I don't necessarily agree with waiting
unecessarily there either, but starting on a full tank isn't something I'll
complain about.

Soandso tells the group, 'Sorry, was trying to click a link.'

Cleric has left the group.

Soandso2 tells the group, 'What a dick'
Soandso3 tells the group, 'Man there's some assholes in this game.'
Soandso tells the group, 'He left cause I clicked in accidentally?'
Soandso4 tells the group, 'Yeah, he ditched a guildie last week cause the
warrior didn't see the pit in oasis on his first adventure ever.'
Soandso tells the group, 'I'm really sorry for the loss guys.  We can't do
the adventure without some kind of healer.'
Soandso5 tells the group, 'Ok, back to camp and we'll pick up a cleric who
isn't such a prick.'

Not deliberately obtuse.  You made a blanket unqualified statement.  I took
you at your word.  :P
