Ok I have read many posts to where people just sit at the PH spot and wait
and kill till he pops....  After camping PH for 4 days at a minimum 4 hours
up till last nights 13 plus a 6 hour wait for the guy before me I just don't
believe it.  So please someone spill the beans.  What else must I do to get
him to pop?  I am so fustrated and tired.  I have read to kill the names but
I don't understand how killing names will help with a 13 min. spawn.  Any
advice would be much appreciated.  Thanks

J
