I have been away from EQ for almost 2 years.  I have come back to play again and the planes of power cd I installed 2 weeks ago go chewed by the dog.  I called tech support they said sorry have to buy a new one.  Is there no where I can get the iso or even just the file to tell the patcher that I have it enabled and do a complete file check and restore?  Any help and I would be most thankful I formated and reloaded because of 2k virus.


Brad
