I play a 46 druid and I use wolfform all the time, and I was bugged as 
recently as last night.  No one in my group could see my wolfform.  But 
I could see it on others, which seemed odd to me.  I wondered if it had 
anything to do with what models you have turned on, but I don't think so 
since some others around me said they had the same model settings (all 
off).
