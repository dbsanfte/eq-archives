I agree! I had no idea he was a newb though.

Just kidding! I've never read his stories, I just posted that 
third person thing because the subject is always like that

"Monual Gets Ignored."

So I answered it sort of, gets ignored for talking about self in third
person. I was bored ;)  I tried to skim the story but I was too tired
to read all that!

For the longest time I saw those and was thinking, "Who the hell is
Monual?"

Have fun!
Seriously, lets all write character journals.
