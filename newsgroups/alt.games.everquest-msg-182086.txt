If I remember correctly, there are two versions of the Gold Edition.
One in a box that does not include PoP and one in a metal tin that
does.  It would be conceivable that the earlier Gold Edition consisted
of Everquest Trilogy plus Luclin, thus requiring two separate
installs.  In the newer version with PoP, there is one installer that
installs all of the expansions and one regkey that activates all of
them.  I also remember that I first had to uninstall Everquest Classic
before I could install Gold.  Hope that helps.
