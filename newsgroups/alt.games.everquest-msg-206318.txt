Sony has pledged support for EQ for many years to come, whether they are 
as good as their word remains to be seen. As for EQ itself, it's a much, 
much better game than it was in the old days. Unfortunately, it's not (
and couldn't possibly be) as fresh and new as it was back then, although 
regular expansions do keep things interesting.
