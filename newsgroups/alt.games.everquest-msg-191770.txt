Chanters bought this on themselves.

The guys who repeatedly ganked BoT named (or whatever zone named), the guys
who bragged and bragged of their soloing exploits, charm tactics that killed
mobs who should never ever have been solod

All that attention and CS nightmare was gonna have some comeback... and this
was it.

I do agree some ppl were jealous whiners, but I also strongly believe
chanters did the most to get chanters nerfed.
