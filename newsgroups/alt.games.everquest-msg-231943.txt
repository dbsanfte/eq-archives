(Can't cut and paste from CR anymore LOL.
too bad its easy to do from the html source, what
a pointless exercise.)

Redwin the 24th level Halfling Druid
Dang the 24th level Gnome Magician
Awakened the 20th level High Elf Wizard
Korpo the 24th level Gnome Magician
Searyx the 37th level Dark Elf Cleric
Trindamere the 18th level Dark Elf Necromancer

Wow! What a shock! All casters! Who would have guessed!


I was actually shocked at the cleric but then I remembered
dueling a few when my ould guild had guild wars going on.
