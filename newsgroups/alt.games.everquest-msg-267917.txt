You hit the nail on the head on this one.  It's funny, this guy talks
about wasted time, yet he takes some precious time out of his
all-important life to post on this board.  Talk about someone who
takes life too seriously.  I wonder, if he died today, would this
world be better or worse off?  The answer, in all probability, would
be neither.  Certainly, he could one day become a very important
person and I would be wrong.  If I'm right and he makes no measureable
impact on this world (as a great deal of us won't), then practically
everything he does is a waste of time.

Besides, there's something to be said for the educational value of
video games.  There have been several instances recently where a
certain word has come up that I recognize solely from my video game
experience.  I know more about mythology than I would have without
Final Fantasy, because I never would have cared to look up Odin's role
in Norse mythology or Quetzalcoatl's in Aztec and Mayan culture.  I
would know nothing of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel that
details the struggle for power between the Wei, Wu, and Shu kingdoms
in ancient China.  Or the turmoil in 16th and 17th century Japan after
the assassination of Nobunaga that ended with Tokugawa taking the
throne by defeating the Toyotomi clan.

There's a very slim chance that I will have any significant impact on
the world, and quite frankly I'd rather work 8 hours and enjoy the
rest of my day then try to be productive every waking hour.
