Raid leaders who realise that the key element to a successful raid is
successful communication.

You can't win a raid by good communication alone, but you will fail most
raids where the communication is bad.

Once a raid force has raided over and over again, and knows each other, and
how each other work, and what is expected, communication becomes
short-hand, but in a raid where people don't know each other, half the
people have never raided, the rest have but all using different techniques,
clear and concise communication is the best weapon you have.
