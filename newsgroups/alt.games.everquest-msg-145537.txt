I ahve one of these.  They are nice when they work with everthing else.

It didn't play nice with me Logitech cordless mouse, one of it's 4 drivers
would keep crashing the system whenever I used button 4.( had all 4 drivers
go curupt from one point top another)   Finaly I droped back to using an old
version of Mouseware, and everthing works.

The best thing about this thing is not having to use your hotboxes for hor
song's / spells.

I Have 4 diferent configurations for mine.
Caster - solo/group
Bard    - Group
Tank    - Whatever

It has a "shift" ability, and you can have macros for every button( eacther
static, or where it puts a pause between each button push )

For the caster I have Two pages set up for the main 10 buttons.  On the
first page I have all my Cast jem comands, and pet attack.  On the second
page I have all my quick chat commands (OOM, Git this thing off of me, ect.)

THe 8 way togle switch SUCKS..   I tried to use it for movement, but it is
just to finicky.   I ended up turning all but 2 directions off
(forwad/backward) I us  the forward B as a omentery shift to the (blue) page
of comands, and back as my "/g %t ate allmost all my Mana..  Time for me to
set a minute"  God did this help..  I kept getting yeled at for m=not doing
enough damadge.  Cum on a necro not doing damadge.   A lot of times I just
stick my 4 dot's and hit this while my pet is in there, and keep medding my
pet.   Opps lost track there for a sec.

The rotary switch I use for my look comands.  I have itr set like this ( top
5% CTRL + numpad 9, 5% off, 20% numpad 9 repeating .02seconds delay, 19%
off, 1% numpad 5, 20 % off, 20% numpad 3 repeating .02second delay, 5% off,
5 % CTRL + numpad 3)         This is a great way to loock around especialy
when you are in view 3 and can change your point of view up and down

The real beauty of this is fopr the bard.  I can set it up to sing the song
with a stop song, and not have to take up my Hotbuttons to do it.

this is what one of my bard Song macro's looks like

with add timing to key stokes turned on
.1 second delay
/stopsong<enter>
ALT + 1

The .1 second delay alows me to cast just as the last song's cast bar is
ending, and the /stopsong makes it so you don't have to hit the gem twice.
no more( well less ) carpultunle synprom complaining bards.  No more
1,1,,,2,2,,,3,3,,,4,4,,,1,1,,,2,2,,,3,(*&%^ i forgot the second
one),,4,4..... ect

For those that have one I know you know what I am saying, for those tat
don't have one....................GET ONE..  there cheap...  less than 3
month's of EQ and they have other uses. not that I ever get time to use the
other uses...  I think I am addicted.  =)
