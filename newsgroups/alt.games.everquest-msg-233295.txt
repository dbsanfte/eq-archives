I petitioned also, got a response 3 days later from a guide telling me a GM
would be looking into it, then nothing. About a week later, I went to the EQ
website and filled out a form concerning it (don't recall what the form was
or the URL for it), and about a week after that, a GM contacted me ingame on
a different character than I wanted the bag for; he then put the bag on the
inactive character for me and apologized for the inconvenience. Only took
almost 3 weeks to get it, and it's 25% weight reduction, not 50%. :)
