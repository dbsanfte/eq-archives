Try out the new Hot Spot zones which give a boost to Experience while
adventuring in them, in a similar manner to Paludal Caverns. The
current Hot Spots are: 
- The Castle of Mistmoore (20th to 30th level) 
- The Lair of the Splitpaw (35th to 45th level) 
- Dulak's Harbor (40th to 45th level) 
- The Tower of Frozen Shadow (30th to 35th level) 
- The Gulf of Gunthak (35th to 40th level) 
- Hate's Fury (55th to 60th level) 
- The Crypt of Nadox (50th to 55th level) 
- The Torgiran Mines (45th to 50th level)
