Groucho (Julius) Marx.

<obsessive>

He wanted to join a country club but they wouldn't allow him in because 
he was Jewish.  There was a big stink, he got invited to join, and he 
wrote back saying "I would never join a club that would have me as a 
member."

His daughter was once refused entry to a pool because of that.  He was 
quoted as saying "She's only half-Jew. Can't she just go in up to her 
waist?"
