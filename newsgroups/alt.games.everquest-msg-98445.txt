Meaning only that you're not one of the "many".  In fact, I don't
remember you being a huge naysayer or proponent.  Of course, I 
might have just missed your posts on it.  Maybe I was too general,
but I got a bit tired of people making solo-centric comments, and
some people admitting they'd never played a caster high enough
for the spellbook to be a part of their life.

My last word on the subject was in another post - summary -
*I* hate the spellbook.  *I* won't pick up my <35 shaman with
it still in existence.  This is a very subjective thing.  You
had no problems with it (the book), I detest it.
