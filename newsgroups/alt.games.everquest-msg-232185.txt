Dark Elves are actually Elves, strangely enough. :)

}The one faction quest available -- turning in Sarnak warbraids (wpn)
}-- is basically almost impossible if you are KOS because you'd have to
}get inside the outpost to turn in the warbraids to someone you are KOS
}to. Illusions don't work well enough, sneak and such might, but one
}slip and they are all after you.

I have heard of people getting this to work, if you can get an enchanter 
mighty enough to charm Captain Rottgrime, and a pull team able to get him 
single outside the outpost.  You used to be able to do it with illusion: 
earth elemental if you were only a little bit KoS, so project illusion may 
help.  In general, though, it's probably not worth it.  Outpost merchants 
are notorious ripoff artists and there's a bank and plenty more merchants 
just a click away in PoK.  If you -really- want the hammer of overthere, 
though, go for it. :)

}One ploy me and my friends try is to get close to the outpost wall
}near where the turn-in is going to happen and have a group memeber
}(who is not KOS) do the turn in. I know we get xp from it, but don't
}see faction messages, so we probably are not getting faction.

No message = no faction.  And you'll never get faction from a handin your 
groupmate does.  You can get flags that way in PoP, but not faction.
