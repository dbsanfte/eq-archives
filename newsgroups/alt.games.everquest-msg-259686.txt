2 things happened:

1.  You left 60, which is one of the fastest levels of
any in the high 50's and 60's.

2.  I take it you mean Sun Revs in the Grey? (those in 
SD are LB/Green at 60) If so you just demonstrated the High
Con Bonus in action.

Sun Revs are level 55, and therefore give a bonus in
XP up to level 60 (the mob must be at least level 55
and no more than 5 levels lower than you.)  The bonus
for a level 55 mob at 60 is 1.95, at 61 it disappears.

So, you went to a harder level, and the Sun Revs give
about half the XP they did.

You're best shot for decent XP right now is grouping
in PoV (maybe some areas of PoJ, a couple areas of
PoN).  The Fiends and Beasts in FC/BC are level 61 or
62 and the XP is pretty nice there.
