If SOe came out with a server where everything, or at least nearly 
everything (would exclude trade skill made items, foraged items needed 
for tradeskills, perhaps dropped items usable for tradeskills (I'm not 
sure on this one), summoned items which are normally droppable and... 
anything else?) was no drop, would you start a character there?

If you could move your current character there, but stripped naked, 
would you?

What if you could move him there and all his no drop gear remained 
intact but all droppable gear was gone...not just flagged No Drop, but gone?

I think the best plan would be not to allow transfers at all, but I'm 
asking the other questions to see if there would be more support for the 
idea with some other approach.


If there's a ground swell of support for this idea, perhaps we can take 
it to the more official web boards and see if we can get SOE liking the 
plan enough to implement it.
