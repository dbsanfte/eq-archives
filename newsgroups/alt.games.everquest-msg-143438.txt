He didn't say it was bad. Khosh stated that it was 'nothing more than a
time/mana saver' like this was insignificant. Tim pointed out it has a
profound impact on the abilities of an entire guild. 

One item. One item that on one player can enable an entire guild to do
things they previously couldn't. To battle rez, zerg, recover, however
you want to term it. This profoundly alters the game dynamic. 

It cant be had both ways. 'The cleric epic has a negligible impact so
there *is* no concern as to the rate it enters the world' is not the same
statement as 'The cleric epic has a huge impact, but its solely positive
anyway, so it doesnt matter'.

As for whether its positive... obviously, for the guild or cleric obtaining
the epic it is always positive. When considering the impact on the game
Verant have to consider the level of contention for content already, how
fast people consume it, if the repop rates are fast enough to sustain
making it faster and easier for more people, and so on.

I'd agree the cat is already out of the bag with the cleric epic myself, but
that doesn't mean adding a triggered ragefire for everyone who got to that
stage of the quest - unlimiting the maximum number of epics to enter the
game every week? - would not have an effect on a servers dynamics.
