Fortunately as a Halfling Druid, providing you maxed your wisdom at creation,
you will have less trouble reaching 200 wisdom than some of the other races.
I'm at 203 and have no wisdom on my arms, head, or chest.  And I haven't
really begun to optimize my gear yet.  One thing you may consider is a cured
tizmak surcoat.  It has 15ac and 7svM.  You don't get the wisdom, but the AC
and resist are pretty decent.  You should be able to get one of these for
under 150pp.  Probably a lot less than that even.

Also do the acolyte anklet quest and leatherfoot raider cap quests in
Rivervale.  The anklet is a wis-agi-cha-AC item and the cap has pretty good
all around stats.  To get the cap you'll need to buy a dragoon dirk as you
won't likely be able to get one on your own at your level.  They are cheap
enough and worth the money spent to finish the cap quest (in my opinion).

Just a couple suggestions,

Moriarty
