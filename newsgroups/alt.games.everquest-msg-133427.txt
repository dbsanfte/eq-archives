The Old Testament doesn't mention Christianity,
but it is important in its history and
development.

Ain't that the truth.

(Of course. I am the prototype of Van Vogt's Right
Man.)

It was an argument in logic. The history of Wicca
is fact, therefore only one answer could be
correct.

Opinions might vary as to what Wicca might be, and
still be valid, but not how it came about.

I agree with them. There is no evidence that Wicca
is an ancient religion, despite Gardner's claims.

They cannot document it, or at least, I have never
found any who could. And, I have tried. 

As far as I know it was Gardner who first used the
phrase Wicca (I think he actually said 'Wica'), to
describe the religion.

I may be wrong here, and may need correcting.

I don't know if you said it all, it came from one
of Lokari's posts, which I disagreed with.

No, we don't... there must be something else I
haven't picked up on yet.
