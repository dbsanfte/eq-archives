I have personally looted levitation from "deranged underbulk" in the
deep. 

However, I've never met anyone who has everlasting breath (the spell,
not halitois); nor have I read anyone say "yeah, I saw it drop in
Tenebrous Mountains".  I've only seen people saying they read on the
web it drops there.   Although I have read multiple accounts of people
camping the named vamp in question for hours and hours and never
getting it.  

I remain skeptical about EB being in the game until I see something
more credible.
