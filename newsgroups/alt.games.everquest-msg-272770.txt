The problem is not that people are willing to trade a few hours salary
in the US for several weeks of some Chinese guy's money farming effort,
it's that their economy is so crappy that having a job like that
actually makes economic sense to them. And that's not our fault, it's
theirs.

Pointing out that the money farmers are almost entirely Asian isn't
racist either, it's just stating a fact. If it were cheaper and
technically possible to set up these money farming operations
elsewhere, they would be. The only reason they all happen to be Asian
is because they have the right combination of a reliable network
infrastructure and extremely cheap labor.
