I read so many Usenet posts that I can't remember the details of what
I read an hour previously, never mind a day or two.

No, bottom posting makes you look at what you're quoting/replying to
and makes it less likely that you'll add "Me too" to the bottom of a
500 line post.

What a LOOB - spoken like a true Outlook Express user, probably the
worst piece of software you can use for Usenet.
