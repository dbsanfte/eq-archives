Has anyone else experienced the bug that drops you for high damage when
porting to a druid circle?

Last night I did a self-port from the Bazaar to the WC druid circle.  I
immediately "fell" for 619 damage upon loading into the zone and died!  I
petitioned and was getting very impatient because it was late and I needed
to log off.  There were 2 guides and 1 senior guide visible in the /who
list.  Still it took about 40 min to get a respponse.

I had moved my corpse a little away from the port-in point thinking that the
fall was caused by characters "stacking up".  When the senior guide showed
up, she said she would rez me this time but I was NOT to move my corpse if
it happened again.  I explained my reason for moving my corpse and the bug
that caused it.  I was very polite about it.  I got the rez box and accepted
it.  I told her Thank You...she left with no reply.

Although I got my rez, I did not feel to happy with the "customer service".
I have only petitioned one other time in almost 3 yrs of playing EQ and the
guide then was very courteous, helpful and stayed in roleplay character.

Anyway, is this bug a "known problem"?
