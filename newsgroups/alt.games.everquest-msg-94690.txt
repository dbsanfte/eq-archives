Officially, yes, they will ban you if they catch you using ShowEQ.  
However, there is really NO way for them to tell if you're using ShowEQ, 
since it is just a packet-sniffer and display program that runs on another 
computer, and decodes the EQ data packets.  Even if Verant were to install 
an agent that sits on your computer and watches what is running, it 
wouldn't be able to see ShowEQ, since it is running on a different 
physical server.
I've never seen the need to run ShowEQ, but I wouldn't worry about getting 
banned if you do.
