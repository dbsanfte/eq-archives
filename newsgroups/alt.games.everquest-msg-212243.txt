There is no cap to how high you can train research, unlike some other skills,
you can keep dropping points into it until you reach your level cap or your
class cap (same for all three classes)

The level cap is fairly low,, something like (your level-15)*5.  And when you
put your first point into the skill, you get it at your current level.
Interestingly, if you buy the skill when it first becomes available, this gives
you a skill higher than the level cap... level 16-15=1*5=5, but you get the
skill at 16 instead.  Its impossible to raise the skill until your cap goes up
enough to be higher than this 16... which means at 17=10 and 18=15 you still
can't raise the skill at all, finally at 19 you can get the skill to 20, so if
you bought it at 16 you can raise it 4 points, but if you waited till 19 to buy
it it can only go up 1 point.

At 24 your skill cap is 45, so you can't raise it to 50.  But if you waited to
buy it at 24 you'd be only at 24 out of 45, so a ways to go to hit the cap

Now, you can either raise the skill by plugging in points at the trainer  (which
I highly reccomend as the fastest simplest and cheapest alternative unless you
have been very lucky with drops and have a large collection of the various
research components rotting in your bank) or by making spells, or by doing the
research training quest and then doing training research.  Trouble with the
latter approach is that by and large its harder and more expensive than just
doing real research.  With research, you can do the lower level spells till they
cap out, then work on the next tier till they trivial and so on, you should only
have to do the level 24 spells for a part of the run (not sure which part, the
25+ skill levels or what)

Again, I'd just put your training points in at the trainer, you get five every
level and your research skill cap goes up five every level and I've never really
found any use for those points thats more useful than that.
