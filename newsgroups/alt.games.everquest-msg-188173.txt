One thing worse than EQ CS is Accounts.

LoY, I prepurchased. Of course just before it went live, unknown by me,  my
credit card expired and renewed. The only thing that changes is the expiry
date. LoY came and all was good. LoY was then disabled and I was sent an
Email saying there is a problem with billing and they will send me a link
later to correct the billing. In meantime they reactivated it for a week.
Email finally came and the link did not work for me nor others that had same
problem. Tried to reorder or reconfirm order to be told "it appears you
already have that" and go no further. I sent them an email explaining all of
this and was sent back another email asking me for all my details as they
cannot process my query... this is all on a email reply by reply thread with
all complete details. Sent them the details, forward it twice as reminder,
got no reply, LoY was disabled so I had to reorder. Of course I can't
reorder as the CC details are wrong. Can you edit your CC details , no you
can't.. you have to go through the subscriptions procedure and book another
X months of EQ, even though I have paid for 2 years play ahead. I now have
LoY and not at the prebook price.

Fuck You SoE... but at least I don't have to deal with fkin Ubishite.
