No, you're thinking of Thurgadin, city of albino dwarves from the last of
your so-called "perfect expansions", Scars of Velious. Requires no faction
farming at all for anyone of any race/class/religion to be able to bank,
buy or sell there. Lots of good tradeskill supplies. You don't even have
to zone to hunt mobs!

Shadowhaven, of course, requires faction farming if you want to do business
with the short guys for most people. And I haven't done enough farming yet
to get the paladins to talk to my evil guys.

But don't let facts get in the way of your religious convictions.
