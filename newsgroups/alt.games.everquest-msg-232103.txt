For those people running multiple games, yes effectively but at 16 or
so players a game where you keep all the data as masters runnin
multiple games at a personal scale runs into the same problems as a
big server rack for larger ops - and still they kept the data...you deal
with scale later on the commercial/non commercial so Ill discuss it here
as well - Blizzard and co were a larger operation with the ability to get
the hardware they needed and still the didn;t.
That makes it a bad design choice whether its the suits or the dev team.

How so - they had alread split single and multiplay so the idea was
already there. Splitting LAN and BattleNet characters wouldnt have been a
problem - I did see complaints about the limited number of character slots
for online play so I think you'd have been able to sell the idea of
friendly vs BattleNet characters easily enough - if nothing else on the
idea of practise with your friends and then play something on the
net....added to that it would have made BattleNet seema bit more
important.

Er yes, both Meridian and Avalon came at the design issue from a different
approach to the PBeMs - Avalon was a one server only Multiuser game with
multiple connect routes (remote play, direct dial in and LAN to the same
server). Meridian - Im not sure off hand how many shards/servers etc
existed but they were exclusive and all player data kept their end

I presented the PBeMs and the server exclusives as the major influences in
the field at the time (as I viewed it at the time and as those friends of
mine in dev then and since commented). Both approaches (elements of which
Diablo included) kept data secure or visibly saw games ruined (thats the
PBeM side) when the data wasnt mastered at centre. SO no matter where you
are designing Diablo from its a bad idea to keep characters outside of the
centre...if you can't you don't do it that way.

Netiquette for snipping what I wasn;t replying to...so far as I saw it the
bit about BNet being a glorified chat server leading to peer to peer
gaming was to my mind little more than a consequence of the design choice
we were dicussing and so subsumed into the rest of the discussions as an
effect. Wouldn't it have been more helpful to
