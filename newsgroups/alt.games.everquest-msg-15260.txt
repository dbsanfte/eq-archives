Your chance of drawing a needed card are y in x , where y is one of the
total cards that would satisfy what you need and x is the total number of
cards left . Usually people harp on card counters because if you can
actually keep track of 52 ,156 , or 364 cards you can substantially change
the odds . Casinos in particular run on a 5-10% profit margin and dislike
people who can change those odds enough to consistently win .

Counting isnt cheating though . marking is .
