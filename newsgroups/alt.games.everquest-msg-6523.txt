Epic quests are designed to be very hard and involved.  They typically
require killing multiple creatures that require 2-3 groups of high level
players.  I'll give an overview of the mage epic:

get coin in Rathe
give coin to guy in WC
get 3 pieces of words from Kith, Unrest, Lower Guk
give pieces to guy in WC, get words
find 4 powers from Mistmoore, Fay, Sol, Kaesora
give 4 powers to rare spawn in BB, get power of elements
get 4 torn pages from CT
give 4 pages to guy in Najena, get words
give words, power, words to guy in Rathe

get torch from city of mists
get burning embers from Named Wurms in Burning Woods
get blazing wand from Kedge Keep
give all to guy in Skyfire to get Power of Fire

get Staff of Elemental Mastery from plane of hate
get dirt of underfoot from burning woods
get broom of trilon (quested)
get shovel of ponz (quested)
give all to guy in Firona to get Power of Earth

get Staff of Elemental Mastery: Water from Kedge Keep
get Tears of Erolisi from OT
get Rain of Karana from East Karana
give all to guy in Dagnor to get Power of Water

get Crown of elemental Mastery from Plane of Air
get Elemental Binder from The Hole
get Pegasus Cloak from South Karana
give to guy in Plane of Air for Power of Air

give all 4 to Master of Elements to get the Orb

As you can see, it is a rather involved process with multiple plane raids
and rare spawns.  For more information, try this
