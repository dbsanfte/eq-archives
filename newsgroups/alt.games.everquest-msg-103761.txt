Id just like to thank everyone for their positive views on this subject!
no one took my orignal post the wrong way, and this turned into an
informative post! Not a sign of any single minded people who just want to
use this forum for their own petty 'I hate the world' views.

Hope this helped any new players, and thanks to the older (wiser :) )
players for being supportive.
