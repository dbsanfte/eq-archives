Ok, let me start off.  

I quit almost a year ago.  (Before Luclin).

I quickly read about archetypes and class abilities after(at?) 51+.

What is this about?  Just to understand the spending experence to gain points
which will get put into abilities which you can custumize better.  

So, lets just say, I'm 60, all kills and exp I gain will goto another exp meter?
Which goes towards points?  Am I'm understanding this correctly?

Is this second meter done the same thing as level exp?  so gaining the first
point is easier then gaining the 2nd skill point... etc, etc.. etc...?  Or do
you just gain points when leveling up (like the 5 training points you get for
every ding?)

Is there a limit on how many skill points you can gain?  Which will naturally
answer this question, whats to stop someone from gaining 5 levels in +str, then
+5 levels in +sta... another +X skill level in each of the attributes til
everything is max out.  Is that possible?  (Given enough time)

I'm just asking a few basic question, I'm sure this has been explain better on
guild boards and such, so if you happen to remember it, just throw the url
towards me and I can read more about it.

I only noticed planeteq's alternate advancement guide, which just tells what
each ability does. 

Thanks, I know it's a simple question, that probably anyone who's playing atm
can answer.
