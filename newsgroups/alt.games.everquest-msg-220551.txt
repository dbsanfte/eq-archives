    Actually, I think we agree a lot. Archetypes. That's all these people
were. They didn't do things that surprised you, they didn't evolve into
different archetypes, they were the same people Day 1 as they were at the
end of the series. Sheridan started a war hero, finished a war hero, and
never made a decision that wasn't that of a war hero. They were stock actors
thrown into a big, captivating plotline to further it. The one character I
actually saw as a motivated, changing character, Londo, had his fate down to
the minute detail telegraphed by a silly time travel episode well
beforehand.
