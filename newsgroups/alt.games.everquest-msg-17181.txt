I'm an exception, I suppose.  Right now I'm running a paladin, and I make a
point of never asking for ANYTHING, not money, not buffs, nothing.  I don't
care if I have to make a naked corpse run into an area I should not have
wandered into; I do it myself with just Courage (at level 13 it's my only
buff) to help me.  Paladins, in my opinion, are real do-it-yourselfers.
They've been given the favor of a deity, and gods do not fritter away spells
on the unworthy.  I greatly enjoy being self-reliant with all my characters,
and I feel that paladins should be especially so.  They are supposed to be
givers, not takers.  "His heart knows only virtue / His might upholds the
weak" and so on.

However, that said, I too will not give anything to people who try to demand
it.  I have something they want, and that means I set the terms for when and
how and at what price it shall be given.  If they expect to get help by
acting like spoiled brats, then they are just plain foolish.  Think about
it, which is more likely to garner favorable results: "Excuse me, sir, but I
notice you're a caster.  Might you have a buff for me?" or "gimme a buff
d00d!  heal!  spare 20 plat?  hurry up!"  I empty my mana bar on anyone who
asks nicely for healing.  For people who just say "heal me", I assess their
situation before deciding.  I put annoying ones on ignore without even
answering them.

You who share my world, take heed: If you want help from me, it is
ultimately your decision whether or not you receive it.


Scuffler, Paladin of Rodcet Nife, out of Halas, The Nameless
