   I do live in the same city that Verant is based out of (San Diego), and I also
have a customer service background (right now I do data entry for the Subscriber
Services department of the Union Tribune, and once in a while I'll take a phone call
or four).
   I have _zero_ desire to become a paid GM.  Anyone who's ever done CS knows that a
sizable percentage of the  interactions involve unreasonable people who are indignant
that your company, and the entire universe as well,  isn't warping itself to
accommodate their every whim.  Not every customer is like this.  The majority are not
like this.  But the ones that are can tense you up and leave you that way for hours
(well, they do to me, and other reps I work with).  I play EQ to have fun.  I can't
imagine doing in-game CS for 8 hours, then coming home and playing for fun.
