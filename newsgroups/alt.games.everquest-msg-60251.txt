It might not have the option of choosing. The end goal is capture of
keeps and relics, which are stationary forts. if a mass of enemy heads
towards one you either choose to fight or not. If not you lose the
keep or relic.

As one realm captures keeps from another its own keeps and captured
keeps spawn fewer and fewer NPC  guards. In other words if a realm
wants to keep it's captured forts it needs Players online and manning
them to do so. If the players in a realm do this then dang it they
deserve to keep the forts. If as i suspect they don;t then forts will
change hands often.
