You guys would have a horrible time breaking the hall. Wil get at
least 2 right off the bat, sometimes get 3.   They have an extremely
high magic resist, 51 bard could probably mez them.  Once got entrance
hall broke it would be a cakewal if sat there (16 minute spawn time??)
, until you got antsie and pulled the crusader and golem, at which
point you all would die or evac.

Add a cleric or someone with superior heal to the mix and would have
no trouble at all.
