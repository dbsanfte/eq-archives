Gotta love that, My exg/f as of a few months ago told me she couldn't go 
out but that she still wanted to be friends and that I was great and 
wonderful and any girl would be crazy to not go out with me... I'm 
wondering if she heard what she was sayin'.  But que cera, cera.  She's 
still one of my best friends which is what really counts.  Personally 
I've been going through Xenosaga and Kingdom Hearts ont he PS2 or 
working on anything in my back burner which is about the size of Montana 
ATM.
