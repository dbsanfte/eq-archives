Whatever you do, make sure you can install the video card in your
computer. I bought a voodoo 5 AGP in January, only to discover my
computer only has PCI slots (and only 2 of them at that). The store
wouldn't have the PCI version for another few weeks and I wanted to
play, so the card got exchanged for a voodoo 3 2000 PCI and 128 mb
ram. Video card went in before installing game, ram went in during
easter (due to PITA positioning inside my machine) and made an
immediate impact.
