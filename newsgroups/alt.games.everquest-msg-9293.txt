Well apart from a couple of attacks on Bizbee which, although one amused me,
are pretty pointless imo, Morse Code trying to gain some sympathy, Titan
declaring he will KF all OT posters and this post/thread, I'd have said it
has been pretty good. Gets posts on topic, Vengy has managed to KF himself
from half of us, no idea how he did that and everything else has been pretty
much EQ related.

It seems to me that if this news group stayed on topic a lot of people would
get really bored, I don't really need to name any names there.

CF
and I'm called a troll?
