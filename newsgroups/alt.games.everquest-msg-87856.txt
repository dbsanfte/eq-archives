 Perhaps. But the patch message only says when they "initially" spawn.
It doesn't say anything about the respawn time being random. It would be
nice if that's the case and they just didn't mention it. Although maybe
that's what your response is saying. I didn't get much sleep so my
reading comprehension is slow.

 It's happened to me. I was sent to Luclin and didn't have a shard. I
haven't tried it lately though.
