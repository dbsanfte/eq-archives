HERE HERE!  Well-put, Lokari!

I can't imagine what a complete nightmare it must be for
the coders to maintain, let alone update the EQ code.
After so many years, so many patches, so many emergency
patches, etc., I'd be willing to bet that the code is
probably not even spaghetti quality :^)

This is becoming more and more evident since it seems
that every patch introduces quite a few new bugs, which
would be caused by the fact that the programmer maybe
does not know how many dozen pre-existing hacks will
break with his one new hack to the code.

I don't envy the EQ programmers at all.  They have to
work with legacy, likely poorly maintained and documented
code.

Of course, along with what the original poster said, I
think that the engine is not very well "built" by today's
standards, either (and to the flamers, NO I never said I
could write something better!!!)  Funcom has the benefit
of knowing much more about 3D graphics, DirectX optimization,
etc. and was able to write an engine with those ideas in
mind.  EQ was written 3 years ago -- an eternity in gaming
technology, and it shows.
