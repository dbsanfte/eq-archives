Did you play EQ the first year it was out?  I remember groups camping rats
in Misty Thicket and you would have to wait for what seemed to be hours for
respawns.

I am currently playing Horizons.  There are vast areas that are unpopulated
at the moment.  This includes cities.  However, finding mobs for experience
has not been a problem.  Also, just the other day I completed a five part
quest whose individual parts were mini-quests.  This actually did give a
decent reward instead of the few silver and faction hits that are all too
common with EQs lower-level quests.

There are the standard trainers in cities and Bankers but there is a lot of
unused space.  That said, the game is fun to play.  The game is very stable.
It has a very fast load time on my box.  In three weeks of play I have only
had one crash and it was not a big deal because I was able to get back into
the game in under three minutes.  The only technical issues with the game so
far is when you gate into a new area the NPCs can take a few seconds to
appear(10-20secs).  This will more than likely be improved with future
patches.  The biggest thing I like about Horizons is its dynamic character
development.  It is possible to have a character who is level 20 in the
warrior school, 20 in the mage school and 20 in the cleric school.  Or you
can choose to go specialized and become a character like a battlemage who
can wear armor and cast serious nukes.  Many possible combinations.

There are a ton of MMORPGs due to come out in the next few years.  It is
unfair to compare a new game to EQ.  It is like comparing a college
graduate(EQ) to a preschooler.
