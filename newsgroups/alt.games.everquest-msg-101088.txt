As I recall, I just mapped those four buttons to the arrow keys. I also have
a MS intellimouse and I bound one of the side thumb buttons to the CTRL key,
so if I want to strafe, I can thumb CTRL and left/right on the N50. Taking
it one step further, I can even thumb the CTRL on my mouse and hit *both* a
left or right arrow on the N50 and the forward arrrow on the N50 when I want
to run forward diagonally.

I'll check out the website when I get home and upload my profile if it's
fairly simple to do.
