The point was, he questioned my ability to understand the effects of KEI on
playing a bard or Enchanter because I have never played one, and yet he has
not played one either.  I don't know how he can say with certainty that KEI
impacting a bard or chanters ability to find a group when he has not played
one.

Yes, but he's using that ignorance to support his argument that KEI is
ruining the game of EQ when they are really two separate issues.  If people
are ignorant of the uses of a particular class, that is not the fault of
KEI.

So because the melee classes are unbalanced I am supposed to "protest" by
not using a tool in the game that makes levelling a lot faster and easier?
That will show em!

So you are saying that ONLY the classes that use mana benefit from KEI?
Lets see......Shaman with KEI partnered with Monk. Does the monk get as much
exp as the shaman? yes? Does the monk benefit from the shamans KEI? yes? Did
the monk pay for the KEI?????????

So are you imagining this scenario is the logical outcome of over use of
KEI, or do you KNOW for a fact that this is happening?  Have you been turned
down for groups because you are a melee class?  Have you been turned down
for groups because you are a caster with no KEI?  Were you told that was the
reason you were turned down?  Or did you assume that was the reason?

If everyone is off soloing with KEI, why do I still see so many groups?
Where are they coming from?

You picked a melee class to play, no one put a gun to your head and made you
select a melee class.  I used to play a rogue and I wanted a class that
could solo better so I switched to playing a shaman.

So SOE caters to casters?  YUP! they sure do, so what are you gonna do about
it?  You have a couple of options.

1. Switch to a different class
2. Encourage your class to complain for improvements to the melee classes
3. Encourage others to nerf the caster classes to even things out

Throughout the game there have been things that for a certian time were out
of balance.  I have to say I agree that something probably will be done
about KEI as it will probably be viewed as "out of balance"  Grudgingly I
have to agree.  I say grudgingly because I REALLY LOVE KEI!  Who wouldn't?
