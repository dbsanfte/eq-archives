Yeah, I've seen nowhere near that number of people unable to get on.
In my guild (about 60 active players, average level 59, minimum 20
hours a week) I know of one person who is unable to play due to issues
since the latest expansion.  I also know of one player who still needs
to upgrade his computer but with a new baby, he's not keen on spending
the money.  So we have 3.33% of my guild unable to play, but only
1.66% of my guild having problems with a machine that meets the
minimum specs.
