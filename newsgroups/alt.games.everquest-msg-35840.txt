Not quite.
The general consensus from people who have WAY the fuck too much time
on their hands is that STR buffs on meleers against blue con mobs has
virtually no effect on their overall damage output.

However, there's VERY little data that can similarly state that STR
buff on melees against white/yellow/red con mobs have equally low
impact.

There was one research done where the researcher found that against
higher conning mobs, the damage "curve" was shifted a bit to the right
when you gave the meleer a very large STR buff (noticably increasing
their damage output).  But that isn't enough data points to state
conclusively.

What I DO know from my own observations is two things:

1.  Our meleers have a shitload of primal weapons now.
2.  Same dragons that we used to fight are dying a lot faster now with
the same people at the same level.

Conclusion:  Who gives a shit, just kill the damn dragon already.  :-)
