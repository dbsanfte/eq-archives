You can raise tradeskills up through level 9 on the
newbie island -- there's parts for every tradeskill and
the merchant sells the reagents.   While you're doing
that, you'll also raise your gathering skills far enough
to not have to worry about it until you need tier 3
materials (except for trapping.)

There's other quests.  Did you kill the named pirate?  Easy
enough to get the quest -- just kill the skeles in the graveyard
until the quest scroll drops.  THEN you can take the same
group to do both quests -- Orc leader and named pirate.
Did you kill the named shark?   Named bear?  Get the bracer
from the gnome?  How about complete the collections quests?

There's plenty to do.   I've raised four characters to max
allowable (220% of level 7, IIRC) and still haven't done
all the quests or killed all the named before I ran out of
XP bar...
