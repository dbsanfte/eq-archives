Obvious sarcasm representing opinion responded to obvious sarcasm

You're right. It's every 10 seconds, I believe.

That sums it up pretty well, I'd say.

I doubt they were meant to be fair comparisons, but more along the lines 
of ideas representative of the strength of their opinion that is in 
direct opposition to yours.

A practiced bard can to some pretty amazing things. I don't see how that 
can be bad.

Reason being? It's the one class so reliant on physician abilities. If 
that's not your cup o' tea, pick one of the many others. What's your beef 
with it? 

I have no reason to assume as much, but it kind of sounds like you tried 
it and it didn't work very well for you, so rather than just accepting 
the possibility that it's not the class for you, you decided to slam it 
and try to make a case than it's broken.
