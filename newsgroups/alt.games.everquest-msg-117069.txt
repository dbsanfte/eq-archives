Ditto what Jazz said...I'll rephrase for the hell of it.

I don't give a flying fuck HOW you beg from me.  If you ask me for plat or
gear, you are a beggar and you are slime and you suck.

If you ask me for buffs you're still a beggar, but it doesn't piss me off as
much as the previously mentioned ones.

But your underlying message certainly is true...when asking for help, the
way you ask it certainly does matter...as long as you're not a beggar.
