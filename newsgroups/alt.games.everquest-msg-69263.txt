Invisibility spells

Post 45, lot of mob see invis, or undead see invis and other see ivu (ie
LowerGuk)
Minor mobs seeing ivu will hit you and make you appear in the middle of a
poped room ...

movement buffs

Concern only druids and shamy, but will be available to every horse owners
in open area.

illusions

Can be usefull, but not often

 roots,

yes, but it doesnt clear agro, you have a 30 sec retarded train. You dont
even the time to loot your corpse.

> snares,

worse than above

> pets,

no, component needed :(

> Gate

you just died, your are yet to your bind point

If you want to wait it become usable, for a 18 sec invulnerability which
doesnt make you run faster...
Only good to be be untounched while tanks build agro

component required too

This can permit to run to zone, but not perform a safe CR in every
situation.
The best suited for this are monk for non caster
Monk FD + their powerfull fists and kick
then Rogues sneak + hide

For casters : druids, shamy, ranger, bard (snare/root + sow + invis)
Then wiz, chanter ( invis + root or mez + mem blur)
Cleric, Pal with root + mem blur and ivu
Necro, SK : FD, fear, ED
Mage : invis only

But imho, your think in the wrong way.

You see bind as the place you repop when you died.
BUT this is the side effect !
Bind works with gate, Gate is the only escape way for a caster to leave a
place he cant cross safely.
A caster can be killed by 5 lvl 15 mobs at 50+ only cause they can bash and
interrupt him and he have not enought hp to tanks em.
In this situation, any melle could start the slashing machine and get rid of
the train before loosing a hp bulb.

Gate is a caster ability, bind is linked to gate, this is why they can bind
themself (almost) everywhere.
Casters are the main bind users. They must be able to choose their bind
location because they can gate.

For a melee, the bind location is not a choice, you dont plane to die and
respawn at a particular place. Melee dont gate, they die to go to their
bind. Casters can go to their bind with gate, because they chose it. The
fact they respawn also theire when they die, is a side effet.

This is a gameplay balance before everything.

Lot of casters are bored to play melee because they cant bind themeselves
everywhere.
Lot of melee are bored to play casters because they are too vunerable to
stupid oom death while meding.
Those who want more power, melle and caster abilities, will have the both
restrictions book, and city bind only.
