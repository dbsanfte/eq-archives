Thanks.  I picked up a Wurmslayer and dumped about 12 points into 1HS.  The
Waki quest doesn't seem to bad and my druid should have no problem
tracking/foraging the needed parts.  I need to look into Rygorr and Ivy
etched, but was thinking of doing the newbie quests in the meantime for the
thorn mail gear..
