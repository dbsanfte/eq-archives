I regularly group with a scout. He often pulls, and we (rarely) have
aggro problems.

I Hold The Line, and target the scout with my bow. As the mob he pulls
comes into range the bow fires automatically, and with a taunt
component because of HtL. If that fails the taunt line has different
casting ranges, so there are a couple of taunt chances as the scout
runs past me.

If he didn't know to run straight for me (since I can't run to him) and
we didn't trust each other I suppose it wouldn't work.

Whether the same tactic works at higher level is for some other tanky
type to say.
