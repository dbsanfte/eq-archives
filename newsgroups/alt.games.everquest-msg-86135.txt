Well it's a matter of opinion of what is smooth...I have friends that tell
me their system is running smoothly (EQ or DAoC or some FPS) and when I look
at it all I see is stuttering frame rates.
When I say run smoothly I want 1024x768 res all models on and be able to
turn with with proper control and 90degree jumps.
My second PC, P3 600 (@800) Geforce2 64mb and 768mb on Win2k does not run
smoothly, as far as I am concerned, in many zones on Luclin (Twilight sea
prolly being the worst)
It's what you want to put up with as to whether you want to call it "smooth"
or not.
