I was involved in a tr group in crushbone.  Doing pretty well with the mobs
until some clown pulled the tower down on us.  he jumped out the tower
window.  Any way durring the commotion I fell out of the window by where the
oracle spawns.  Trying to get back inside I aggroed the Warlord.  I was the
only one of my group that was outside the castle.  I put up a pretty good
fight against the warlord but I had to run.  I tried to get to my social
hotkey to get my help social activated but I accidently disbanded from my
group.  Some one from the bridge saw my trouble and helped me out.  He cast
a greater heal on me and snared the Warlord.  The group leader was outside
and invited me back into the group and I accepted.  I also got in a blow to
kill the warlord.  i looted the Bracers of Battle and a piece of a grimore.
one of the group members sent me a tell saying that it was cute of me to
disband from the group to go after the warlord.  I told her what happened
and even said that the bracers should be put up to roll.  She later said
that she believed me but I have this feeling that people are going to talk
and trash my name.  Also the party memebers were not telling me who the
winner of a random role was.  is it the highest number between 0-100 or its
different from each group.  We killed crush 3 times and he had the tunic
twice.  I didnt win the roll because i dont know what made it a winner.


Thanks
