I"m so jealous!  For some reason I love the look of my vah shir girl
running around in bikini bottoms (or rather, my husband does, and I'm
being nice and indulging him), so I'm always on the lookout for
"graphicless pants" for her. SOe, those bastards, keeps changing the few
pants I find (nathsar, then primeval leggings of madness), so I'm now
reduced to wearing INT caster pants.

If I had your bug I'd be such a happy cat....
