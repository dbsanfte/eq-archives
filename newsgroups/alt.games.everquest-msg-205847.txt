Would love this too, but I doubt they will add the instancing to old
dungeons. If they did, they might have to tweak the drop rates. All
the drop rates in old dungeons are balanced on the idea that the
spawns are competative in nature. I dont know if there would be more
of an influx of certain items or not, since many people could
simultaneously camp and item at once, but since there would no
respawns, only a few of those would get the item at once. How would
something like the Raster camp in LGuk work with this technology? Of
course camping something for 70+ hours is just nuts, but is it in
everyones best interests if this were suddenly made really easy?

Im hoping for a player/guild housing concept too with this technology.
Would be pretty cool to have a guild hall or your own personal
apartment.
