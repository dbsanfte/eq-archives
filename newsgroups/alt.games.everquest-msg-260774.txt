Of course bards offer more to a group in something like hard Ldon.  Its hard
to compare anybody to the most powerful and diverse class in EQ (be it monk,
rogue, whatever).

As for debuffing on inc and stacking the mobs, whilst of course any extra
helps, lets not get too carried away. -15 base (to fire cold and magic) for
18 seconds, compared to shamans -55 (cold, magic, poison, fire) for 14
minutes base, or -50 on chanters tash for 14 mins.  I don't think that seals
the deal in grouping with them.

Of course it comes down to mezzing. I don't think very many people setup
ldon groups without seeking crowd control (and some wouldn't even do a
mission without a CC)

Personally any missions i do, my group is just a room behind. So the option
for mezzing mobs along the route back doesn't really apply there (wheres the
logic in pulling and controlling extras [to save time], when it requires
keeping the group further back, meaning longer runs/pulls [losing time])

Is that really any different to having a chanter mez the add, debuff and
slow it while they kill the initial mob?
Sure its more desirable to have 1 person doing it, but it not like theres
only 1 way of doing it, or 1 "acceptable" way.  Theres only so many of the
holy trinity classes around and available.

Im sure many monks can attest to the fact they have pulled countless ldon
hards in under half the time too. I know that the hard ldons i do (full
group) we arent waiting for mobs and splits, and we sure as hell don't win
close to the end buzzer.   I do a lot of hard ldon duoing too (monk, cleric,
shamanbot).  There isnt time to piss about splitting mobs, nor is there the
capability of handling overpulls. We do just fine though.  And again, those
don't "run to the buzzer".

Bards are clearly more desirable in ldons than monks are, but so are
chanters (and a whole heap of other classes). So unless your gonna tell me
chanters and rangers, wizards, beastlords etc pull better too!

I still stand by the claim a competent person can pull a zone (with whatever
tools he has at his disposal) regardless of their class.  And i say that
having been witness to monks, bards, and SK's all competently pulling
multiple-environment zones to a good enough level.  And im talking good
players.  The shit bards are as bad as the shit monks and the shit SK's,
move away from a zone of blue con mobs (where half the classes ingame can
just lull them) and the class distinction becomes a blur as to who or what
can competently pull there.

-m <-- monk, bard, sk, and other assorted characters...
