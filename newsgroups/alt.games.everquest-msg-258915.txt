Yes, I did it over dialup successfully over 3 years up until the latest GoD
expansion where I got ADSL.
I noticed having a Hardware (External - non -usb) modem helped a lot.  Once
I switched to one of them I hardly ever got dropouts etc. (i.e. once or
twice a month) as compared to the internal modem (where it used to drop out
at least every couple of days (worse when it had rained recently).
