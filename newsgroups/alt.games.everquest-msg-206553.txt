Something I've noticed (although it could be a superstitious behaviour rather
than something that really works) is that I can counter streakiness by turning
in place.

I can fizzle a spell ten times in a row, then turn slightly and cast it.

So, when I get a skill up, I try not to turn, and when I don't get a skill up
(or when I fizzle or something else I don't like happens) I tend to make a point
of turning a bit.

IF this really works, it isn't 100% reliable, I can't get zero fizzles with it,
nor can I get ten skill ups in a row.. but I -do- find I get two or three in a
row quite often, and I rarely fizzle a -lot- in a row even with very low skill.

I surmise that the same sort of thing is happening here as happens with spell
casting after moving; turning sends some sort of message to the game engine that
merely stopping does not, in that case, and it might somehow be a trigger for
when to start using a new "random" seed; by deliberately -not- triggering when
something good happens I may get two or three of the same result before the game
figures out to get a new number; by deliberately triggering a new seed when
something I dont' want, like a fizzle, I force a new number instead of getting
two or three of the same "bad" one.

Does this work?  Or is it just a placebo effect, seeming to work?  I sure can't
say, never having tested it conclusively.

I do know that when I fizzle ten times in a row, turning and then not fizzling
sure reinforces my tendancy to turn on a fizzle!
