Druids and necromancers are the best soloers; magicians and shamans
can also solo well.  One drawback with necros is that, since they are
considered an "evil" class, they have to deal with the problem of
being KOS (killed on sight) in some zones (unless they work on raising
their faction).  Warriors, clerics and rogues are hard to solo with
(although clerics can do well soloing undead with their undead nukes).

Well, you can always try out different races/classes; you can have up
to eight characters per server (except for the Firiona Vie roleplaying
server and one of the PvP servers, forget which one, where you can
only have one character), so you might want to experiment with
different ones to see what you like playing the most. 

NOTE:  There are specific servers that are PvP (player versus player)
servers.  You might want to wait till you've had some experience
playing on the blue servers (non-PvP servers) before you try playing
on a PvP server, if you're interested in that.  You CAN play a
player-killer on a blue server by turning in your tome of order and
discord (book your character starts with) to the Priest of Discord in
your starting city, but it's really not worth it, though, as you can't
get healed or buffed by other players when you're a PKer on a blue
server; you're better off playing on a PvP server.

Generally, if you play a wisdom based caster (cleric, druid or shaman)
you'll want to put as many points into wisdom as possible, and if you
play an INT based caster (enchanter, magician, necromancer, wizard)
put as many points into intelligence as possible, as those values
determine how much mana you'll have to cast spells with. There are
plenty of items like jewelry, armor, etc., that can help boost your
stats.  Also, some races, like Dwarves and Erudites, have low agility;
you should generally try to make sure your agility is at least 75.

Druids and wizards are the only classes that can port; however, you
can offer to pay a druid or wizard to port you.  Otherwise, you need
to run everywhere (or take the boat).

Some sites I would recommend are:

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/
http://eq.castersrealm.com/
http://www.everlore.com
http://www.eqatlas.com

The first three have lots of general information about character
creation, details of classes and races, discussion boards, player
guides, links, etc.  The last URL, http://www.eqatlas.com, has
detailed maps of almost all the zones in EQ, as well as a summary
description of the zones (what level mobs, indoor/outdoor, etc.).

There are a number of good dungeons in EQ.  See http://www.eqatlas.com
for more information.
