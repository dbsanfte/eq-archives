Hey all,

Been hunting Elysians for a while now to get their armor and keep
coming across Elysian Skulls. They are stackable and No Drop. I
searched around, including allakhazam and found nothing on them. Does
anybody have any clue what they are for?

As well, the elysium bone powder. Not No Drop and have no idea what
that is for either.

Thanks
