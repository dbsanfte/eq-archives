I always bought the pelts at ~5p and farmed the silk. But i noticed
lately its a lot harder to farm spiderling silk in the feerott. I
always used the triangle from the druid rings north to zone wall, east
to ruins/zone wall, and then southwest to rings again. But now they
have black and pristine silk for some reason and the drop rate on
spiderling silk is generally low.
