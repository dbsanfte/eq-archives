Hehe I'm really glad to hear you enjoyed yourself Cursim :)  Alot of the
quests can be a blast to do, and you can come out with some incredibly
useful items at the end of the day.  It's a shame im not on your server or i
would love to come give you a hand with the quest.  It's also good to see
you didnt get worked up over dying... it happens, and as long as you had fun
thats the main thing.  Keep up the good work Cursim, youll be a sorceror in
no time bud :)
