Hey, nice move.  This means that to quickly level up a character like
a necro or druid (speedy solo leveler) and get junk to twink your
real character, you'll have to get a second account.  Once you've
done that, though, you are openly encouraged to pharm, as even
normally no-drop items are now tradable!  Sell the stuff that
doesn't work for your twink, and give him the goodies.  Level 6
cleric with full Grapewear!

Since most people on the server will be running two accounts, then,
to get around the annoyance of one character per server per account,
that means twice the income for Verant

Oh, sorry, did I have /cynic mode set to on again?
