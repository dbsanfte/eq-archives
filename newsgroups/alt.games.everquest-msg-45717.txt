Folks, I am sure this question has been asked and answered multiple times
and I, therefore, ask your indulgence (although I do have some asbestos
undies :-)).
Question:  What is best way to avoid or minimize having to sit through all
the patch updates if I reformat my hard drive and have to reinstall EQ?

I purchased Partition Commander (couldnt find partition magic in my area)
and could creat a new partition to put EQ in all by itself but I am waiting
for a new rewrite CD so I can back up all my data files.  If that doesnt
work, is there something else I can do in preparation of the possibility
that I may have to reinstall EQ?

Thanks in advance,

Bob
