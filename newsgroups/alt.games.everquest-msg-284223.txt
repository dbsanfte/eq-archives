Hi Peter  :)

Yes, although if you wish to, you can, instead, go into the Guild
Lobby in Plane of Knowledge (ask for directions if need be) where
there are non-player characters who will sell you a gem to magically
bring your body to you.  These gems get more expensive the higher
level your character is - just right-click on a gem to see what level
it is used to recover.  You then give this gem to a corpse summoner
npc, and he does the actual summoning for you.

Your body will appear, and you can get your stuff there and then, OR
you can ask a friendly cleric to "rez" (resurrect) you, meaning you
will get back some of the experience points you lost when you died.

>MY "DOG" AND WOULD IT HELP HIM WITH HIS FIGHTING?

You might accidently give your Wolf something worth a lot of money,
and you can't get stuff back off your pet, so unless it's just
vendor-junk, I'd hang on to it, in case your son loses a much-prized
item, heh.  The toys generally favoured for pets are Summoned by
high-level mages.  Look in the Bazaar and enter a search for SUMMONED:
(including the colon).  You will then see things like Crystal Belts,
Hands of Ixiblat and Muzzles of Mardu listed.  They sell for a few
plat and are very useful.  The Belt gives Strength and so forth, as
well as several hundred extra hit points, The Muzzle makes it attack a
bit faster and the Ixiblat's have a fire-damage effect on them - give
your pet two of these, because at your level your pet can dual wield
weapons.  

If you wish, ask in Plane of Knowledge if a Mage will summon a bag of
Plate Mail for your wolf - it CAN wear it, but you don't actually SEE
it, more's the pity.  It adds approx 90 armour class to your pet which
is nice.

Oh, don't forget to buff your pet with whatever spells you have,
especially the "Spirit of Scorpion" - it gives your pet a magical
attack.  I mention this as some players new to a beastlord forget to
cast this  :)

>4) TRIED A.. /SHOUT.. COMMAND FOR HELP WITH MY PREDICAMENT..NO RESPONSE

Possibly the Zone was empty, or maybe they missed your /shout due to
being in a melee and having so much "battlespam" whooshing up the
screen  :)  People could well have been willing to help, but then just
didn't know where you were, as a /shout gives no idea of your
location.  If someone is close enough to you, do a /yell, as this will
give the recipient some idea of where you are...  "Peter the Wolf
yells for help to your right" sort of thing.

Then again, some people just can't be bothered to help, sadly, as in
real life  :(

>Hopefully I can find a "game friendly individual" here

I'm sure you'll get loads of help  :)  Good luck!
