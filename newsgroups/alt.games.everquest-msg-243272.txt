Humm!

The Quoted SOE EQ Minimum is a Geforce1 card.

Therefore a Geforce2 card should work reasonably well with EQ. Maybe 
with a couple of bells and whistles turn off or down.

I haven't played for a while, as between the video lag, loading and 
zoning times and finally my Halfling and Gnome characters getting stuck 
in the scenery at places they have been loads of times before.

The ramp out of the water in Gunthak being the worst, I died as a result 
of getting stuck there!

My machine is a 550Mhz K6-2, Geforce2 Ti, Creative Audigy, 384MB Memory

I use to play EQ with:

All new models
Mipmapping on,
1078x756 32bit video
Texture caching on
Approx. 50% on particles
100% Clip plane with 3D sky in old world, 50% and basic sky in new world 
and 0% in Bazaar.
framerate in old world 30+, New World 25+, Bazaar 10+

Now to move at all in some zones I have gone to:

All old models
Mipmapping off
1078x756 16bit video
Most particles off.
50% no sky old world, 0% no sky new world. I haven't risked Bazaar.

Oh! and texture caching was removed by SOE to improve "loading and 
zoning times"

Mine improved from 2 title music cycles loading to character select. It 
is now 5 cycles.

While zoning has improved from a poor 30 seconds to a dazzling 2mins+

Overall EQ still jerks very badly along at about 3/4 of my previous 
smooth framerate.

SOE state Geforce2's should work.

So phooey it is 2 years old. It should work (Full Stop)

Yours
