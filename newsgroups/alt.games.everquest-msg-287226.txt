DO YOU WANT TO MAKE MONEY FAST?

Of course you do, we all do!

Here's how to do so with little effort, and, yes IT'S LEGAL. And for
you
doubters. I am
laughing all the way to the bank :-) And guess what? I was a doubter
too!!


        A little while back, I was browsing these newsgroups, just
like you
are
now, and came across an article similar to this that said you could
make
thousands of dollars within weeks with only an initial investment of
$6.00!
So I thought, "Yeah, right, this must be a scam!" but like most of us,
I
was curious. Like most of us, I kept reading. Anyway, it said that if
you
send $1.00 to each of the 6 names and addresses stated in the article,
you
could make thousands in a very short period of time. You then place
your
own name and address at the bottom of the list at #6, and post the
article
to at least 200 newsgroups. (There are about 22,000.) or e-mail them
to
friends, or e-mailing lists...

No catch, that was it.

Even though the investment was a measly $6, I had three questions that
needed to be answered before I could get involved in this sort of
thing.

1.      IS THIS REALLY LEGAL?

I called a lawyer first.  The lawyer was a little skeptical that I
would
actually make any money but he said it WAS LEGAL if I wanted to try
it. I
told him it sounded a lot like a chain letter but the details of the
system
(SEE BELOW) actually made it a legitimate legal business.

2.      Would the Post Office be ok with this...?

I called them: 1-800-725-2161 and they confirmed THIS IS ABSOLUTELY
LEGAL!
(See Title 18,h sections 1302 NS 1341 of Postal Lottery Laws). This
clarifies the program of collecting names and addresses for a mailing
list.

3.      Is this moral?

Well, everyone who sends me a buck has a good chance of getting A LOT
of
money ... a much better chance than buying a lottery ticket!

So, having these questions answered, I invested EXACTLY $7.92 ... six
$1.00
bills and six 32 cent postage stamps ... and boy am I glad I did!
Within 7
days, I started getting money in the mail! I was shocked! I still
figured
it would end soon, and didn't give it another thought. But the money
just
continued coming in. In my first week, I made about $20.00 to $30.00
dollars. By the end of the second week I had a mad total of $1,000.00!
In
the third week I had over $10,000.00 and it was still growing. This is
now
my fourth week and I have made a total of just over $42,000.00 and
it's
still coming in.....

It's certainly worth $6.00 and 6 stamps!

So now I'm reposting this so I can make even more money!  The *ONLY*
thing
stopping *ANYONE* from enriching their own bank account is pure
laziness!
It took me all of 5 MINUTES to print this out, follow the directions,
and
begin posting to newsgroups.  It took me a mere 45 minutes to post to
over
200 newsgroups.  And for this GRAND TOTAL investment of $ 7.92 (US)
and
under ONE HOUR of my time, I have reaped an incredible amount of money
--
like nothing I've ever even heard of anywhere before!

'Nuff said!

Let me tell you how this works, and most importantly, why it works.
Also,
make sure you print a copy of this article now, so you can get the
information off of it when you need it. The process is very simple and
consists of THREE easy steps.



============
HOW IT WORKS
============


STEP 1:
------
Get 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each piece
of
paper:

    PLEASE ADD ME TO YOUR MAILING LIST.
    $1 US DOLLAR PROCESSING FEE IN ENCLOSED.

(THIS IS KEY AS THIS IS WHAT MAKES IT LEGAL SINCE YOU ARE PAYING
FOR AND
LATER OFFERING A SERVICE).

Now get 6 $1.00 bills and place ONE inside EACH of the 6 pieces of
paper so
the bill will not be seen through the envelope to prevent theft/
robbery.
Then, place one paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal them. You
should
now have 6 sealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the
above
phrase and an U.S. $1.00 bill.

Mail the 6 envelopes to the following addresses:

 #1  Kim Smith
       700 Archer Street #1
       McKeesport, Pa 15132

 #2  Peter L. S.
       1253 Leaside drive
       Pittsburgh, PA 15207

 #3  P. Sunshine
       184 Plymouth Street
       Pittsburgh, PA 15211

 #4   D. C. Springer
        308 W. Belvue Rd.
        Greenville, SC 29609

 #5   Franklin C.
       6136 Moss Springs RD
       Columbia, SC 29209

#6    Jesse Thoemmes
        95-318 Ho'okowa place
	Millilani, HI 96789

STEP 2: Now take the # 1 name off the list that you see above and move
the
other
 names up (6 becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, etc.) and add YOUR Name as number
6 on the list.  (If you want to remain anonymous put a nickname, but
the
address MUST be correct. It, of course, MUST contain your country,
state/district/area, zip code, etc! You wouldn't want your money to
fly
away, wouldn't you?).

STEP 3: Now post your amended article to at least 200 newsgroups.
Remember
that 200 postings are just a guideline. The more you post, the more
money
you make!

Don't know HOW to post in the news groups? Well do exactly the
following:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO POST TO NEWSGROUPS FAST WITH YOUR WEB BROWSER:

                The fastest way to post a newsletter: Highlight and
COPY
(Ctrl-C) the text of this posted message and PASTE (Ctrl-V) it into a
plain
text editor (as Wordpad) and save it. After you have made the
necessary
changes that are stated above, simply COPY (Ctrl-C) and PASTE (Ctrl-V)
the
text into the message composition window, after selecting a newsgroup,
and
post it! (Or you can attach the file, without writing anything to the
message window.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have Netscape Navigator 3.0 do the following:

1. Click on any newsgroup like normal, then click on 'TO NEWS'. This
will
bring up a box to type a message in.

2. Leave the newsgroup box like it is, change the subject box to
something
flashy, something to catch the eye, as "$$$ NEED CASH $$$? READ HERE!
$! $!
$" Or "$$$! MAKE FAST CASH, YOU CAN'T LOSE! $$$". Or you can use my
subject
title.

3. Now click on 'ATTACHMENTS'. Then click on 'ATTACH FILE'. Find your
file
on your Hard Disk (the one you saved from the text editor). Once you
find
it, click on it and then click 'OPEN' and 'OK'. You should now see
your
file name in the attachments box.

4. Now click on 'SEND'/'POST'. You see? Now you just have 199 to go!
(Don't
worry, it's easy and quick once you get used to it.) NOTE: All the
versions
of Netscape Navigator's are similar to each other, so you'll have no
problem to do this if you don't have Netscape Navigator 3.0.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                ! QUICK TIP!

             (For Netscape Navigator 3.x and above)

You can post this message to many newsgroups at a time, by simply
selecting
a newsgroup near the top of the screen, hold down the SHIFT, and then
select a newsgroup near the bottom of the screen. All of the
newsgroups
in/between will be selected. After that, you follow/do the basic
steps,
stated below at this letter, except of step #1. You can go to the page
stated below in this letter and click on a newsgroup to open up the
newsgroups window. Once you've done this, in the same window go to
'OPTIONS', and then mark 'SHOW ALL NEWSGROUPS' and 'SHOW ALL
MESSAGES'. Now
you can see all the newsgroups and you can apply easier the above tip.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

        If you have MS Internet Explorer do the following:

1. Go to the newsgroups and press 'POST AN ARTICLE'. To the new window
type
your headline in the subject area and then click in the large window
below.
There either PASTE your letter (which it's been copied from the text
editor), or attach the file which contains it.

2. Then click on 'SEND' or 'OK'. NOTE: All versions of MS Internet
Explorer
are similar to each other, so you won't have any problem doing this.

GENERAL NOTES ON POSTING: A nice page where you'll find all the
newsgroups
if you want help is http://www.liszt.com/ (When you go to the home
page,
click on the link 'Newsgroup Directory'). But I don't think you'll
have any
problem posting because it's very easy once you've
found the newsgroups. All these web browsers are similar. It doesn't
matter
which one you have. (But it makes it very easy if you have Netscape
Navigator 3.0 or later. You may download it from the Internet if you
don't
have it.) You just have to remember the basic steps, stated below.

BASIC STEPS FOR POSTING:

1. Find a newsgroup and you click on it.

2. You click on 'POST AN/NEW ARTICLE' or 'TO NEWS' or anything else
similar
to these.

3. You type your flashy headline in the subject box.

4. Now, either you attach the file containing your amended letter, or
you
PASTE the letter. (You have to COPY it from the text editor, of
course,
from before.)

5. Finally, you click on 'SEND' or 'POST' or 'OK', whatever is there.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE MORE MONEY
YOU WILL
MAKE! BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200**

That's it! You will begin receiving money from around the world
within

days! You may eventually want to rent a P.O.Box due to the large
amount of
mail you receive. If you wish to stay anonymous, you can invent a name
to
use, as long as the postman will deliver it.

**JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT. **

=================
Now the WHY part:
=================

Out of 200 postings; say I receive only 5 replies (a very low
example). So
then I made $5.00 with my name at #6 on the letter. Now, each of the 5
persons who just sent me $1.00 make the MINIMUM 200 postings, each
with my
name at #5 and only 5 persons respond to each of
the original 5, that is another $25.00 for me, now those 25 each make
200
MINIMUM posts with my name at #4 and only 5 replies each, I will bring
in
an additional $125.00! Now, those 125 persons turn around and post the
MINIMUM 200 with my name at #3 and only receive 5 replies
each, I will make an additional $626.00! OK, now here is the fun part,
each
of those 625 persons post a MINIMUM 200 letters with my name at #2 and
they
each only receive 5 replies, that just made me $3,125.00! Those 3,125
persons will all deliver this message to 200 newsgroups with my name
at #1
and if still 5 persons per 200 newsgroups react I will receive
$15,625,00!
With an original investment of only $6.00! AMAZING!  And as I said 5
responses is actually VERY LOW! Average are probable 20 to 30! So lets
put
those figures at just 15 responses per person. Here is
what you will make:

at #6 $15.00

at #5 $225.00

at #4 $3,375.00

at #3 $50,625.00

at #2 $759,375.00

at #1 $11,390,625.00

When your name is no longer on the list, you just take the latest
posting
in the newsgroups, and send out another $6.00 to names on the list,
putting
your name at number 6 again. And start posting again. The thing to
remember
is, do you realize that thousands of people all over the world are
joining
the internet and reading these articles everyday, JUST LIKE YOU are
now! So
can you afford $6.00 and see if it really works? I think so... People
have
said, "what if the plan is played out and no one sends you the money?
So
what! What are the chances of that happening when there are tons of
new
honest users and new honest people who are joining the internet and
newsgroups everyday and are willing to give it a try? Estimates are at
20,000 to 50,000 new users, every day, with thousands of those joining
the
actual Internet. Remember, play FAIRLY and HONESTLY and this will
work. You
just have to be honest.

By the way, if you try to deceive people by posting the messages with
your
name in the list and not sending the money to the rest of the people
already on the list, you will NOT get as much. Someone I talked to
knew
someone who did that and he only made about $150.00, and that's after
seven
or eight weeks! Then he sent the 6 $1.00 bills, people added him to
their
lists, and in 4-5 weeks he had over $10k. This is the fairest and most
honest way I have ever seen to share the wealth of the world without
costing anything but our time! You also may want to buy mailing and e-
mail
lists for future dollars. Make sure you print this article out RIGHT
NOW,
also. Try to keep a list of everyone that sends you money and always
keep
an eye on the newsgroups to make sure everyone is playing fairly.
Remember
that HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY. You don't need to cheat the basic
idea to
make the money!

GOOD LUCK to all and please play fairly and reap the huge rewards from
this, which is tons of extra CASH. Please remember to declare your
extra
income. Thanks once again...

===============================================================

LEGAL? ? ? (Comments from Bob Novak who started this new version.)

"People have asked me if this is really legal. Well, it is! You are
using
the Internet to advertise you business. What is that business? You are
assembling a mailing list of people who are interested in home based
computer and online business and methods of generating income at home.
Remember that people send you a small fee to be added to your mailing
list.
It is legal. What will you do with your list of thousands of names?

Compile all of them into a database and sell them as "Mailing Lists"
on the internet in a similar manner, if you wish, and make more money.
How do you think you get all the junk mail that you do? Credit card
companies, mail order, Utilities, anyone you deal with through the
mail
can sell your name and address on a mailing list, unless you ask them
not to, in addition to there regular business, So, why not do the same
with the list you collect. You can find more info about "Mailing
Lists"
on the internet using any search engine.

." So, build your mailing list, keep good accounts, declare the
income and pay your taxes. By doing this you prove your business
intentions. Keep an eye on the newsgroups and when the cash has
stopped
coming (that means your name is no longer on the list), you just take
the
latest posting at the newsgroups, send another $6.00 to the names
stated on
the list, make your corrections (put your name at #6) and start
posting
again.

===============================================================
======

NOTES:

*1. In some countries, the export of the country's exchange is
illegal. But
you can get the license to do this from the post office, explaining
the
above statements (that you have an online business,
etc.  You may have to pay an extra tax, but that's OK, the amount of
the
incoming money is HUGE! And as I said, a few countries have that
restriction.

*2. You may want to buy mailing and e-mail lists for future dollars.
(Or
Database or Spreadsheet software.)

*3. If you're really not sure or still think this can't be for real,
please
print a copy of this article and pass it along to someone who really
needs
the money, and see what happens.
*4. You will start getting responses within 1-2 weeks, it depends.

someone who did that and he only made about $150.00, and that's after
seven
or eight weeks! Then he sent the 6 $1.00 bills, people added him to
their
lists, and in 4-5 weeks he had over $10k. This is the fairest and most
honest way I have ever seen to share the wealth of the world without
costing anything but our time! You also may want to buy mailing and e-
mail
lists for future dollars. Make sure you print this article out RIGHT
NOW,
also. Try to keep a list of everyone that sends you money and always
keep
an eye on the newsgroups to make sure everyone is playing fairly.
Remember
that HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY. You don't need to cheat the basic
idea to
make the money!

GOOD LUCK to all and please play fairly and reap the huge rewards from
this, which is tons of extra CASH. Please remember to declare your
extra
income. Thanks once again...

LEGAL? ? ? (Comments from Bob Novak who started this new version.)

"People have asked me if this is really legal. Well, it is! You are
using
the Internet to advertise you business. What is that business? You are
assembling a mailing list of people who are interested in home based
computer and online business and methods of generating income at home.
Remember that people send you a small fee to be added to your mailing
list.
It is legal. What will you do with your list of thousands of names?

Compile all of them into a database and sell them as "Mailing Lists"
on the internet in a similar manner, if you wish, and make more money.
How do you think you get all the junk mail that you do? Credit card
companies, mail order, Utilities, anyone you deal with through the
mail
can sell your name and address on a mailing list, unless you ask them
not to, in addition to there regular business, So, why not do the same
with the list you collect. You can find more info about "Mailing
Lists"
on the internet using any search engine.

." So, build your mailing list, keep good accounts, declare the
income and pay your taxes. By doing this you prove your business
intentions. Keep an eye on the newsgroups and when the cash has
stopped
coming (that means your name is no longer on the list), you just take
the
latest posting at the newsgroups, send another $6.00 to the names
stated on
the list, make your corrections (put your name at #6) and start
posting
again.

NOTES:

*1. In some countries, the export of the country's exchange is
illegal. But
you can get the license to do this from the post office, explaining
the
above statements (that you have an online business,
etc.  You may have to pay an extra tax, but that's OK, the amount of
the
incoming money is HUGE! And as I said, a few countries have that
restriction.

*2. You may want to buy mailing and e-mail lists for future dollars.
(Or
Database or Spreadsheet software.)

*3. If you're really not sure or still think this can't be for real,

needs
the money, and see what happens.
