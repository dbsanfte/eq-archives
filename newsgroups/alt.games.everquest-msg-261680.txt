Many of the games at least start out with the concept that decay will be 
simply time based. Longer you have it, worse it gets.
Part of the idea is to prevent stockpiling stuff.
SWG was going to do that on things like furniture, then decided it was 
too penalizing to the casual gamers.
The crafter classes argued long and hard for time based decay on 
everything. Weapons, armor, clothes, drugs, commodities... you name it. 
Plus use based decay on weapons, armor, etc on top of that.
