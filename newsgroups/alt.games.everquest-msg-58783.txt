 I dont see any problems with people twining characters. I do see melee twinks
much more often the casters for some reason...even if they dont admit
it...Seriously..goto Oasis and youll see lvl 14-20's and about 90% of them are
twinked somehow. When my shaman was there in his leather armor i have many
things given to me in respect to me not twinkin..kinda funny? But i do remember
one time in the Dreadlands with my SK.. There was a lvl 40ish warrior in
banded....somehow i became the main tank..i wonder why..<mana sponge!>
