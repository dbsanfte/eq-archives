I have bugged and reported this behaviour in the past (with no responce)
I have also posted some suggestions to the EQ Boards on Sony (No
responce)

What I have found is that this is only a problem till you know that it
is happening and even then only really a problem between levels 20 and
30.

Between 20 and 30 Mobs start dropping "some" plat, however they normally
drop less plat than there are group members so the effect of the
splitting is hightened, e.g. :

A group of 6 are taking out Mobs who drop 1pp, 5pp, 6pp 10pp and 100pp

1pp   Mob : Looter gets it all
5pp   Mob : Looter gets it all
6pp   Mob : Everyone gets 1pp
10pp  Mob : Looter gets 5pp everyone else gets 1pp
100pp Mob : Looter gets 20pp everyone else gets 16pp

So the looter is always getting more.

A quick bit of pocking about shows that if a mob is dropping between 28
and 33pp the looter is only getting 25% more than the non looters, but
at average drops of 10pp the looter is better off by 241% !

At drops of less than 10pp it is not even worth having autosplit on.

Once you can get your partys to understand this you should be able to
institute a better loot rule. That or leave the group.

The austo split system is stupid, and I think that if it can not be made
to work better (e.g. random division of remainders) then it should be
removed as it is a PITA to explain this every time I group. At the very
least it should come with a warning.

HTH,

Jim
