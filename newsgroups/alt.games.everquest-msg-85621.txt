Just because you leave your front door unlocked doesn't mean its okay
for people to come in and take your stereo, though. No one deserves to
have their account stolen.

Anyways there's no clue either way over how he stole them, and some of
the posts seem to indicate he stole at least one account that had been
inactive for a while.

This guy just learn that sometimes the internet isn't as anonymous as
it seems... and that there can be consequences for assuming it is. :-)

I hope he rots in hell myself.
