Um.. no. For a lot of the things you will agro kite if a mob turns on
a pet it'll probably kill it. The point is to engage the mob, and
generate enough agro so that it *ALWAYS* wants to kill the player,
then kite it by staying out of its melee range while the pet beats it
down from behind. Make sure for pets with taunt the taunt is turned
off, its usually on by default once the pet is made..

I.e. you are a necro. You can(fear is normally used, but agro kiting
works too), snare a frost giant scout in GD.. dot it up, and then sic
the pet on it. The agro generated from the dots hopefully keeps the
giant occupied with you so as to not notice the pet beating on it from
the rear. Path back and forth while the dots and pet do damage and
when its hp hits 0 loot up and rewash. Fear kiting is the same thing
except you snare and then fear the mob. Once feared you don't have a
lot of control over the direction the mob goes in. Pet beats on it
from the rear and you follow it wherever it goes. Agro kiting is
typically more control over mob pathing, fear kiting is typically more
control over mob turning and killing pets from time to time.
