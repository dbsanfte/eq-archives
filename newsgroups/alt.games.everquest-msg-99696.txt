He wasn't doing me a favor by teleporting me, I paid him. I wasn't doing a
favor for him by giving him 35pp, he was going to tp me. THAT (And a "Thank
you.") is all the apprecation required.

You're right that it isn't a very long walk. After the whole Lake Of Ill
Omen fiasco I was nervous and just wanted to get where I was going and get
bound there.

He also did not tell/ask me that he was going to tp me to Butcherblock.

All I want to say is they may be just as good most of the time, but
sometimes, for a reason of which you may not be aware it is not so I hope
you ask or at the very least tell the other person first.
