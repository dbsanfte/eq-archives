I too have a similar schedule, and, playing EQ2, I can tell you that I 
am diong fairly well.  I have both a 29 Paladin who has now completed 
324 quests (The most in our guild, Resolute on Lucan D'Lere) a 22 
Warden, and a few others up to about 14.  In all likelyhood I would not 
try this playing EQ, as my limited time periods make finding groups 
difficult and unfair to both me and the groups as we are likely just 
getting into a groove when I have to depart.  EQ2 however, I have 
managed to solo very well with all of my  toons at any time of day.  The 
few times I needed help completeing quests I had little difficulty 
putting together a group capable of completing the task.  I take it upon 
myself to start a group for a quest I need if I see none being 
advertised.  While I know that I could quite likely be much further up 
the food chain if I grouped more for longer periods in prime times, I am 
happy with my progress and status thus far.

I do hope that helps.

Ragards,
