I like the idea of permadeath, at least for certain classes.  Or maybe
you could choose to make your character 'mortal' upon creation ?  The
tradeoff might be enhanced abillities, more stat points to allocate,
etc.  Downside would be losing everything that character has ever
accumulated upon his/her death.

That way, only people who were willing to take the risk get the
advantages.  People who want to play it safe are a bit behind the
curve, ability wise.

This seems a fair and logical tradeoff, but MMORPG player's being what
they are, you'd probably get a howl of complains from people moaning
about the 'unfair' advantage their 'mortal' companions would have over
them.

People are idiots, and I think MMORPGs can make this people even
worse.
