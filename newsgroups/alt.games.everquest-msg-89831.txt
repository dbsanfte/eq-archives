If you can find some big animals you could do the fear kite thing
really well. My monk teamed with my druid friend and we would
rage on animals. Druid snares dots and fears, then sits his ass
down and meds until mob is dead or fear wears off, Monk just
wails on it from behind. Mob goes down fast and the monk takes
minimal damage.
