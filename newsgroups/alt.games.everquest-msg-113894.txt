They are totally different games, with different rule sets, different
features, and so on. Why would anyone expect that things planned
(emphasize that, since it's over a year away) for EQ2 should be also
shoe-horned into EQ? 

Do you have any idea what it would require to implement an alternative
death penalty in EQ? The entire game would have to be rebalanced.

>are they going to improve EQ1 in this regard?  Noooooooooo!

EQ doesn't require improvement in this regard, as it isn't flawed.
