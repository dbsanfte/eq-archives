Most songs do not require instruments, but many are enhanced by instruments...
once you have the proper skill.  If your bard is a real newbie the only
"instrument" he has is singing, which does not require an instrument at all.
Your first instrument skill will be percussion, get a drum and equip it and
you'll notice a jump in the effectiveness of Chant of Battle, the level one bard
song, for example.  Some drums are better than others, look around for Walrus
Skin Drums if you have a couple hundred PP to spend, Selos drums are better
still, but hard to find sold, and expensive.
