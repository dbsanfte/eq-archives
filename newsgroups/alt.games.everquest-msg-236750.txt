Heh. One thing that bugs me, probably more than the paranoid delusions
about RPGs, is the complete misrepresentation of pagan beliefs. =/ I
also find it funny that he called Tolkein and Lewis Carrol "occult"
books based on the fact that they could be found in occult bookstores,
when most sane Christians see their stories as symbols of the authors'
Christian faiths. Also note that the Bible can be found in most occult
bookstores as well....
