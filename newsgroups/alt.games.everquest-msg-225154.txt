Just because you've found a way to convince suckers to buy garbage 
doesn't make it right to be selling it.

Legally?

Nothing wrong.

Morally?

There has always been a fine line between making an honest buck, and 
just plain ripping people off... e.g. la $20.00 for water at an outdoor 
concert in the hot sun... or maybe you think that's just good business 
too??... and theirein lies the crux of it... we're all going to draw 
that line differently. I don't think I've drawn it unreasonably for my 
own value system... your welcome to put yours a little to the left or 
right as you see fit.
