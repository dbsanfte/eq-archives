With SK's AC, HP, range and snare, I think its quite arguable who makes the
best puller, to be honest

The snared one won't dawdle behind, he just won't move till snare is off

Robe?  My monks BP for the last year was made from dragon skin.  I guess
thats like paper too, right?

Why not?  It stands true or rogues.  The argument for rogues doing more
damage (originally monks WERE the king of damage, no ifs, no buts) was
because monks tanked better - well that won't be true anymore, so do rogues
get an offensive decrease, or a defensive decrease.

To be honest I couldn't care less what they did from now, if these changes
go live they are confining eq to its death bed more so then any other rival
game can currently do so
