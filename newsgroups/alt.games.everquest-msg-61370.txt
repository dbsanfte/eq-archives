Well, I my main is a shaman, so good spellbook organization is crucial for
me.

My recommendation (with the preface that I've never played a wizard, so
this may not work 100% for you) would be:

Page 1/2: Put in the "standard 8" spells that you memorize every time you
die, that cover most of your needs. The other two slots can hold spells
that you regularly switch to. For my shaman, it goes:
Immobilize (root), Tugur's Insects (slow), Chloroblast (heal), Envenomed
Bolt (DoT), Regrowth (regen), Celerity (haste), Cannibalize
(um...cannibalize), Gate (gate)...with spirit of wolf, and spirit of the
howler (wolf pet) as my alts.

Pages 3/4 are the ones that I most commonly switch to...buffs, invis, malo,
bearform, levitate.

Pages 5/6 are lesser malo spells (which are easier to land on some mobs
than the higher ones), other debuffs (cripple, flash of light), and
resistance buffs

Pages 7/8 Are little-used offense spells (nukes, disease DoT, AE rain, the
root spell)

Pages 9/10 are useful spells that seldom get used, but are nice when I want
them...shrink, bind, imbue ivory, summon food/water, enduring breath.

Starting on 11/12, I place all of the spells I've out-grown grouped by
level. 11/12 has level 1 spells, 13/14 has level 5 spells, 15/16 has level
9s, etc.

As a wizard, I'd suggest going the same way I do on your first page
(although of course, with different spells)...

3/4 would be commonly switched offense spells (different element types for
various mob resistances, etc), as well as useful spells like invis and IVU
and levitate (if none of those qualify as your page 1 alternates)

5/6 Evacs/Translocates

7/8 Ports

9/10 (if you even need this many), whatever else you find you use

Make hotkeys to immediately flip to a page number so that you can quickly
swap out spells when needed.
