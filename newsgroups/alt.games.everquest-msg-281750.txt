OOW level 69 rune mobs were our bread and butter for a long time;
now everyone has their 69 spells, and we will be hitting Chailak, Feratha,
and any other 70 rune mobs we can when we get the opportunity.
Rhorious may be too much for us, I don't know. If he's not much
harder then Velitorkin, he will be on our list.

  We just finished Tipt runs for a lot of people, and will be hitting Ikkinz
when the officers can schedule it.
