Nonsense, I played a warrior to level 30 and soloed most of that, it 
really wasn't particularly hard to do so, its just a matter of picking 
your fights: you want mobs that don't run (because you have no snare) 
and that you can get single (because you have no way to park them) and 
that you can kill on the hp you can get back via bind wounds.

When I did it, that meant 50%, or slightly more if you had a lot of HP 
gear.  They've changed that now; when I did the same thing with my 
berserker I could bind up much higher, which meant I could take on 
harder mobs.  And the regen rate was also changed, so that it actually 
made sense to wait for full hp.  Soloing a warrior was far from 
impossible before, but post changes, it must be even easier.

If there's a class that can't solo to 70, I suppose it would be the 
rogue, the only class who's ability to deal decent damage relies on the 
mob facing in the other direction.  And even there I have my doubts, as 
I'm not sufficiently conversant with the class to know if they can get 
ahold of a fear and snare kit of some kind.
