When the old world gnolls start to go light blue in the early levels, 
there are still plenty more. Iceclad has some good alligned gnolls who 
will wreck particular factions for you, but are definitely killable. 
Plus there's lots of them and nobody hunts them. Karnor's castle has 
gnolls that will take you to level fifty and a little past easily. From 
there you can level to 60 on the gnolls in Jagged Pine Forrest in the caves.

I don't recall ever hunting any gnolls from 61 to 65, nor have I seen 
any that I recall in PoP zones. Who knows? GoD may have a whole new race 
of gnolls only for the uber.
