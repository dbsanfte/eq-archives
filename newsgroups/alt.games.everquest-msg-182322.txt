You might not be...

I've been invited in several groups, or invited myself ;-), just to let 
them AND me get the group xp bonus. Which is quite nice I think. I;ve been 
in several parties, which I was the only untwinked character, and I 
deliberately asked a looting code, since they left a lot untouched. Almost 
anytime we worked out that I was the solitary looter, unless I looted 
something they were intrested in for quests, tradeskills eg.

But as an druid you can still keep them sowed, even a lvl 50 buff won't 
help you evade trains in Paludal or Black Burrow....
