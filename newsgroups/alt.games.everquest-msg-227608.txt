I don't really mind the idea of selling the beta.  I just think the price is
outrageous.  After all, most MMORPG's never really move beyond the beta
portion of thier development, IMO.  Where they lost me was because they went
out a'spamming.    I don't preorder games... and I'm certainly not going to
buy it after it's released, considering they've made me click through an
advertisement for it every time I log in for the past 3 weeks.

Then they started the in-game spam via GM announcements.   Kind of funny to
see every chat channel start going nuts every time they do it.   SOE is
definitely not making friends with this agressive advertising.
