Yay from with with qualifications. When I was a young iksar monk, I wanted
to make my own cured armor, and was successfully talked out of learning
tailoring due to the huge bias towards caster-as-artisan. So I made a druid
alt (had many reasons but tradeskilling was one). The difference in the rate
of learning skills was very noticeable. Now, if I multiclass, will I find
that I'm crippled as an artisan unless I chose a caster as my primary class?

I hope they abandon the relationship between stats and skills, so that, as
in SWG, an artisan can be someone who stays at home and crafts away, rather
than needing to be someone who can kills gods solo, so that they can get the
AA points and no-drop gear that the master artisans in EQ1 generally use to
make the profitable items. And that's not counting the awful loophole that
made a bard a million times better at farming gear to master smithing than
any other class...
