I am a developer.  I have designed, tested and delivered large and complex
software systems.  I have called myself stupid for some things I have
screwed up on before.  Stupid things get missed.

Having said that...

I call them stupid not because they may have missed it in testing (no one
has yet confirmed the bug yet, as far as I've seen anyway), but because IF
TRUE, what in THE HELL does being a wolf have to do with your level?  This
speaks to horribly broken design.  The possibility that being a wolf can
somehow hide or otherwise disrupt the piece of data that corresponds to YOUR
LEVEL is beyond idiotic.  Of course, the number of things that wolf form
and/or other illusions have screwed up in the past already says that the
entire illusion thing is a horrible kludge to begin with.

I will not accept that there is a reasonable explanation for this.  (Again,
if this is even true to begin with.)  No, I don't really think their
programmers are stupid, but they have done MANY stupid things.  I have
enough experience, with both EQ and in software development, to say this
without hesitation.

And no, that doesn't mean I can't like the game--I do.  I just shake my head
in disbelief at some of the things that go wrong.
