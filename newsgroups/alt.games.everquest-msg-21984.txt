May have just been a run of bad luck.  When I went to get my bracer,  me and
a friend were there for over an hour trying to get hin to spawn.  I think
the bandits are on a 6 minute timer or so (that is alot of bandits).  After
about an hour he spawned and we killed him but I was pretty beaten up and
got killed.  Since my friend already had one he could not loot this one and
it rotted before I could get back (was very ticked off due to the length of
time we had spent here).  My friend gave me his and said he would just come
back the next day to get one.  He came back and said that the lord spawned
in about 5 minutes.  This was about 2 months ago on A Ro.
