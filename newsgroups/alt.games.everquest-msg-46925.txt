Does anyone know if, all other factors being equal, higher Intelligence or
Wisdom speeds up caster meditation rate?

I could see it going either way.

One way, the med rate would be constant, and only the total mana would
increase.  The other way, total mana would still increase, but mana regen
rate would increase in the same proportion so that a complete empty-to-full
med would take the exact same length of time.

I'm afraid it's the first way.  Some things I've read seem to imply that
scenario.  But I figured it might be worth asking to know for sure.

I would check this myself on my own char, but I don't have all that much int
gear.  So any difference in med times between naked and equipped may be
smaller for me right now than the margin for error in timing it.  Especially
since mana is not measured digitally.

Apologies in advance if this has been covered before.
