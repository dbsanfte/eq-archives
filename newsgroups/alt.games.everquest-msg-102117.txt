Just after zoning into Echo Caverns and passing the first set of
guards, there is a hidden door to the north. In there are a whole
parcel of evil trainers and merchants.

As to your first question, my Dwarf Cleric was ableto trade with the
bazaar merchants only to start with. I did the Steatons Deliveries
about a dozen times (which only raises faction a little) and got to
Warmly with Traders of the Haven but still dubious with the 3 houses
of Haven. Guess who the merchants in the east quarter of haven are?
House Merchants! Ho hum.

I then did the Traders of the Haven run once (easy to get back cos I
am a cleric with gate) and was still dubious. The second time took me
to Apprehensive - the merchants would deal with me (with poor prices)
but the Trainer still told me to get lost. After TOTAL of 6 runs, I
was ally with Traders of Haven and Indifferent with the houses - hey
presto I could shop and train anywhere in Shadowhaven.

P.S. You don't really need the neckalge - it's only a +chr item, not
+faction any more.
