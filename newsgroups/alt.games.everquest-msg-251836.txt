Non melee types get a damage bonus of 1 period.  Weapons will typically 
do a max damage of 2xdmg+bonus.  So, for non melee, that means the dagger 
can do a max of 23, and the staff a max of 51.  For melee types, the 
maximum damage is much higher, as the bonus can be much higher.  In 
addition melees can crit.

Not sure why his max damage is 37 with the staff off hand, could be a 
damage cap for his class.
