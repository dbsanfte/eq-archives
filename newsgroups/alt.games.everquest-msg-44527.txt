Kael isn't that great for XP camping - the mobs have very high HP
compared with most Kunark zones, which makes for long fights.  Not
efficient.  The Hole between entrance & ledge is great for low 50's,
but starts greening out at 56 or so.  By 58 it's not an option - going
deeper would be required, and there's no way in hell I'd do that with a
pickup group.  The place gets scary fast.

The other unmentioned place is Howling Stones, but that's *definitely*
not a pickup group dungeon.  Also happens to be one of my favourites :)
