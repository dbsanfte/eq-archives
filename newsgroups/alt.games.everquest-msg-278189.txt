Here's a tip that works even when the vendor is full... buy something on 
the vendor that sell back for the same price. Gems in the 5-50pp range 
are the best... buy a few gems... converts all your gold/silver/copper 
instantly. Hang onto the gems until you've got a stack (buying more each 
time you need to convert, and then sell the stack for a minor loss).

Sure there's no loss your way ... but I'd go nuts converting 2 thousand 
silver and as much copper your way :)

Numbering the list wouldn't be a difficult thing to do. Feed back that 
too :) They could list the entries from 1-80.

A done button is a good idea too.
