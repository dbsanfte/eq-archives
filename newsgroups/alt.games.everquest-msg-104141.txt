Honestly I don't give a damn why the servers went down, I'm just really really
glad that they did ; )

What it meant was that after staying up until 5 am Saturday morning killing
Golems in Fear (after the scheduled raid left them up) with no joy, we got
three more Golems (and Dracoliche) on Saturday afternoon for our guilds
scheduled Fear raid ; )      Dread dropped the Ball of Everliving Golem (as
did Terror, heh) which is the last hard to get piece I needed to complete my
epic ; )

Now it's just a hop skip and a jump from Isles 3 to 5 in Sky and I'll be
wielding my very own lightsabers ;)




And no, I cannot stop using the ; ) 's today...  appologies to those who
disapprove of thier use ; )
