Snipped from later:

Nope. I think they rock. Of course, *any* spell is far less impressive
when if fails to go off because Mob_01 has it's clawed foot up your ass.

Nah, enchanters get interrupted as much as any caster.  Our channeling limit
is the same.  However, the level 4 stun takes very little time to cast, so
it's pretty easy to get it off.  And the amount of time a critter is stunned
by that one gives the enchanter time to cast the level 20 stun without
interruption.  And THAT stun gives the enchanter time to mez the critter.

You're confusing a good enchanter with a bad cleric or typical wizzie.  I
don't run around screaming unless I have a bad cleric or warrior in my
group. :)

Two or 3 heals isn't greedy.

Either a cleric or an enchanter are the primary classes that say "EVAC!!!"
A tank isn't qualified in most cases unless he's very well aware of THAT
particular cleric and enchanter's abilities.  It's happened MANY times where
a tank thought we were in deep doo-doo 'cause he accidently pulled 5 or 6
critters when we were expecting one.  They thought we should get the hell
out of Dodge but my reaction was often, "so? Just 5?  Come back and fight."

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE try to remember just that.  It's not your fault if the
enchanter dies unless you were preventing him from taking care of himself.

So why is your group pulling multiple reds?  I mean, up to 3 are ok if
they're "light" red, but yeah, that'd be the puller's fault if the enchanter
dies and there's nothing you could have done about it anyway.
