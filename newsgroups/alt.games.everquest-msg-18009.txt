Everyone who has ever played has had that opinion, it will change and you
yourself will twink alts (alternative characters) even if not with full
cobalt and a pair of Lammys you'll still pass items down.

I agree, shouts should be in character chat and not rambling about your
Video card, how Verant suck, has anyone tried AO or who's going to buy SWG
when it is released. I mean FFS I sometimes think that all EQ is a GUI
version of IRC. The odd shout that is ooc doesn't bother me, constant
conversations will get a request for them to use tell's or the OOC channel,
further to that or just simple abuse will just end up on /ignore.
