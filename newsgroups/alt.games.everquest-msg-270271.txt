Well, I can say with confidence that WoW won't hold you very long - 
leveling is vastly faster than EQ1.  It's not a problem for me because
I haven't actually played the game in weeks (I'm weird enough to get
as much enjoyment out of coding a major UI mod as I am actually playing
the game.)  and I firmly believe that, by the time I do level my 
characters up to 60, get good gear (light raiding I hope) then hero
classes will be in.

But it does sound like it would be a problem for you.
