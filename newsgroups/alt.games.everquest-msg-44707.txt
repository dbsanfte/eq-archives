I think what you're seeing is general network instability, not an
overloaded server.  Even Uberguilds can't port between servers, though
I guess one could all transfer to a new server at once.  I think you'd
notice a bunch of naked 60s frantically killing stuff for gear.  

The lag problem has been bad on Innoruuk too, and it's located in the
same server farm as Vazaelle.  Tech support doesn't say much other
than yeah, it's probably a connection problem, but there is a note
about connection problems at castersrealm.  Maybe everyone transferred
their 2nd character onto a 2nd account, and is now the servers have
4000 people on them at peak hours and those bastards at Verant are too
cheap to buy a 2nd t1 and Brad should be eaten alive!
