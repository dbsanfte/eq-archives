*pulse races*
*eyes dart durtively around the monitor screen*
*whole body tenses up at first target of undead*

god, i love running kith at night, did it drunk once
got drunk with a bud who's account got stripped, was loaning him some gear
logged on drunb the next night, had to get some smithing supplies to dye
some armor from HK, so off i go - still drunk as a skunk
slip thru kith like always, *pulse racing* and hit HP
staggerng at the entrance there, watching the high teens hunting orcs,
asking if anyone had a drink   :)

btw, as dafoo, i been killed once since i was about 15th, and that was at
41st
even now, kith still ain't safe at night, but i will be damned if some damn
inky undead general gonna keep me from doing what i want   :P
