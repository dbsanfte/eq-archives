Wow what a rush!   Did a lot of your melees not have banes or something?
Thats an incredibly long run on the emp.

Of course they do..  a rotation would give you guaranteed kills on the mob
every single other pop.. 50% of the pops, wheras up until now they have
killed 2 of (nfc, I'll use my server as a rough guide 45 emporers).. compare
50/50 and 43/45

Keeping your rivals out of vexthal is much like back in the day, trak was
killed long after the main guild stopped needing his teeth.. broods to keep
guilds out of ST etc.

What those individuals did is dispicable.. no doubts there..
But blowing the emp spawn when you did not have the forces to even attempt
him, or even any intention to try him, is pretty lame...
Shitty acts seem to be repaid with other shitty acts in high-end EQ.. and I
think your raid leaders made a bad call that day.

If CiH wanted to kill all your targets rather than advancing themselves,
even if it were just out of spite, they probably wouldn't have many problems
doing so...

"Couple of members" dispelling mobs.. theres 4 mobs to be mezzed, and couple
would imply enough to dispell all 4, ya? Seems to me, if all 4 mobs were
chain dispelled, your chanters would have been killed within seconds.. those
mobs hurt.. flurrys, iirc some unslowable.. not to mention mana isn't great
and healing/support is sparse during the blood/emp killing.

Im not suggesting your lying, but every story has 2 sides.. just seems like
a big flaw to the claim of events from your guildies

You already tried emp, by triggering him.. why would the other guild not get
the next attempt?  Seems like the fair comprimise to me (tho blowing the mob
for hours and hours is still fucked up)

2 identical name mobs spawn the Gylped (beggining of the cycle).  Did you
guys kill both?

What exactly did the other guild do?   Whilst im sure there was some
discussuion between the 2 guilds leaders that were not privy to, based on
whats presented here, the other guild got screwed with that kind of gm
resolution.

Cursed cycle, well thats a tough one to call because each guild can claim to
have killed the triggers to pop it.  Only gylphed is really in question
though, everything else was spawned by them, in direct response to them
killing gylphed.

Both guilds had arguably legitimate claims to gylphed..  but it seems more
of a disputed/contested mob than "they fucked you over"

Prexus was similar somewhat, 1 guild controlled Emporer from day 1 of Luclin
to the day PoP was released.   Yep, they got him to themselves for an entire
expansion.

As to what it would have cost them.. shrug, thats politics for you.  Im
guessing they were the guild to release the sleeper?
You could use the same reasoning and call them childish/greedy for waking
the sleeper.. they have their reasons for doing it.. and yes, restricting
others does help yourself maintain your #1 spot.  Ruthless, maybe so.. its
no different to r/l or what happens in nature tho..

Keep them tanked/mezzed in the corner of your choice, once all loot is
called/looted, ae tl and get everybody to leave at the same time.  Unless
your afk there should be no reason you die in the time the whole raid gets
out there

Congrats :)   You've completed 1/3 of the Luclin endgame bosses (Emp, other
2 being Seru and Aten), something 95% of people don't even see - and its a
fantastic feeling/achievement.

And yes, all the drama bs does leave a bad taste in your mouth.. but hey, at
least the messageboards flames make good reading on Monday morning at
work... :)
