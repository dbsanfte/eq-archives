If the mobs are spawning every 15 mins at the entrance then moltor will
eventually spawn .  If they are not spawning at the entrance then a ph mob
is up and you will need to kill it to get cycle started again .

Best way to get it started is to have someone sit at entrance and watch for
spawn . Then start at the bottom of dungeon and kill everything working way
up till spawn at entrance starts (grads on finding the ^$#@@#$% ph :)
