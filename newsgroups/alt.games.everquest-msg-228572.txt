Mr Knox, in case you hadn't figured out, the bottom feeders who sell
plat and items aren't really liked here. You state that you aren't
screwing up the economy, well, you are right, the dupers are doing
that. What you and the rest like you are doing is quickly turning the
game into another version of Diablo.

BTW, your name, address and phone number have been turned over to SOE.
Hopefully they won't delete your account. <----Sarcasm
