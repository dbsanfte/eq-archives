Imagine a scenario where a few friends got together and thought it
would be interesting to pick a few chapters from some book and re-
write the endings, rearrange the plot, alter the characters -
basically put their own spin on it - and then share the results of
their efforts amongst each other in a sort of weekly book club. It is
*exactly* the same thing, but I hardly think John Grisham would have a
*legal* leg to stand on if he didn't like their doing it.

That said, they may be perfectly willing to put a stop to it by
throwing enough litigation at them to make ceasing and desisting their
only option financial option - which should be the real crime, IMO.
