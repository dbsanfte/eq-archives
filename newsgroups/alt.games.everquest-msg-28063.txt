Rather than swearing when angry I usually just emote something appropriate
to the character I'm playing.
My ogre warrior:  /rude  "Hey youse! Yur mudda wears combat boodz!"
My dwarf cleric: ": jumps up and down like a three-year-old and screams in
apoplectic rage." (he's a tad.....unstable)
My paladin: ": points at %T [whoever's annoying me] and slashes his finger
across his throat meaningfully."
