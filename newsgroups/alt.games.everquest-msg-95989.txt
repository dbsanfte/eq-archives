Using your picture as an example, what's easier:

Casting a spell by looking up, finding the spell gem icon, and clicking it
or;
hitting the number 1, or 2, or 3 on your keyboard?
Trying to use a right click item by opening inventory, finding the item,
right clicking it or;
hitting the number 5 on your keyboard?
Trying to use harm touch by clicking "Combat" on the abilities window, then
clicking harmtouch or;
hitting the number 4 on your keyboard?

Not to mention the fact that when your screen is full of spell graphics and
players, the mouse pointer can get very sluggish.  I would cringe if I found
out my cleric on a raid was a gem-clicker.  I would not hesitate to say that
using hotkeys to cast spells/use skills is one of the differences between a
so-so player and a great player.
