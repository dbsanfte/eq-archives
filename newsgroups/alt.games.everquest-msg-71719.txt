I agree, the Ranger is not a class that can solo with ease every level but
they can often find a mob/spawn that they can solo to clear certain levels,
for example, my Guild mate near enough solo'd to 60 from 59, I say near
enough because obviously solo'ing is kinda boring compared to group hunting
but I believe the majority of his exp came from solo'ing some (factionless)
dwarves in EW.

The same can be said of SK's. If you look about and experiment enough you
will likely find areas to get through levels but you wouldn't just be able
to walk into any zone and solo there, like necros (almost) can.
