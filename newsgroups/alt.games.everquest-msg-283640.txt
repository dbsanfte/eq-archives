*** Tradeskills ***

- Radiant Tourmaline of Minor Quickening will no longer magically turn
into Radiant Tourmaline of Aggression if you fail to make the combine.
- Disabled the recipe for Coadjutor Mechanoinstructions so people do
not "waste" their components on this recipe. (Since the Coadjutor
Mechanoinstructions have no use)


*** Spells ***

- The Dreadstone spell now summons a stack of 100 Dreadstones.
- The Blessed Aura and the Holy Aura spells should not fade when the
Flames of the Valiant and Flames of Redemption buffs fade.

following zones to not update properly: Splitpaw, The Hole, Nurga,
Droga, Plane of Fear, and Plane of Hate.


*** Missions ***

- The Spies Like Them mission should now more accurately recognize
when all NPCs in the zone have been slain.


***  Events ***

- Many raids in instanced zones that required multiple groups to start
can now be started with a single group.


*** UI Changes ***

- Fixed a problem with the barter search window not always returning
the proper results when searching by player name. 
- The guild window is now available to everyone, regardless of
expansion!
