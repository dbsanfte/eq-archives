order from SOE, you can download... they say download only.. but on EB site
you can get a Cd for 18.99$ and for 17.99$ at Gamestop... I was just curious
why SOE was saying its a download only when you can get a CD and why they've
choosen not do it as a CD but have made it available elsewhere? Have they
talked about this yet?
