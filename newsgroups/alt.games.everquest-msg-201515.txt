Druids are fucking useless except for ports.  I'm sorry I WASTED all the
time I put into mine.

well, I take that back...somewhat.  my druid is good for farming shit,
getting around for tradeskill items and shit like that.  Otherwise,
COMPLETELY. USELESS. IN. GROUP.RAID. SITUATIONS.

Once you get the people where they need to go, you're a 5th wheel.  Sure,
you can solo very well, and you get all the spoils of the kill, but then you
have the inevitable downtime medding back to full....during which time a
group-friendly class is still killing things and gaining XP.

51 levels and a LOT of plat put into my druid.  what have I got to show for
it? a toon that is worthless to groups outside of travel.

well, it wasn't a COMPLETE waste...I did get into a killer guild because of
my druid.

go bard (you'd be surprised how useful a GOOD bard can be) or Ranger.  Just
please....NO FRIGGING ASSLING RANGER.

as for tracking, it was useful with the druid, I imagine it would be even
moreso had I been able to sort.
