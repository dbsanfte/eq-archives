Although I have only been brave enough to go into Kith Forest a couple
times.  Myself and a fellow guildie ventured into there today.  We were
collecting Bixie Combs for the Stein quest.  Now I am a 21 chanter and
he is a 34 chanter, we zoned into the forest after 8am.  We stayed close
to the zone back to WC and went just a little out of the pass there to
the cabin.  I had SOW and went to the opposite side of that lil house.
When what should I see but a DE that suddenly hit me 3 consecutive times
for over 100 damage each time.  3 hits, i'm dead...LOADING, PLEASE
WAIT,.  Then what should I see, but the 34 Chanter that was with me,
also naked back at the starting point.  Ummm, who is this?  I am a DE
and so was this Tier dude. Someone new?
