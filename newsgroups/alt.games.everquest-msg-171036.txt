Is the midigation baced on armor type assighend to a class or assighned
by the actual armor your wearing?
IE a warrior with a 500 ac in leather armor or 500 in plate would be on
the same table or different?

"A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I
advise the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives
boldness, enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the
ball, and others of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp
no character on the mind. Let your gun therefore be your constant
companion of your walks."
