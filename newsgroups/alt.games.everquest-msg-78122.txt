Being a necro means never having to say you're sorry.

Tarre is 14 DE necro. My dwarven cleric twinked her a little (cough),
and she'll tell anyone how deeply she resents it. She'll call him names
in guildchat. (Yes, same guild) And she often greets people by her
favorite recipe for their meat.

While she has taken a great deal of delight in convincing the folk in
freeport to allow her to shop there, and even go to the bank in NFP, she
knows she is biding her time until she is strong enough to hunt their
guards. It is the only faction work I plan on doing, and it went easily-
two days of an orc camp, handing in a few belts, then Jenam and Rebby
quests.

Everything exists to die, and death isn't always the end. 

Of course, you will still need other real people as friends, and you
should make it clear that you are not deliberatly trying to offend
folks. Send them tells that you are being in character and explain, when
necessary.
