On the other hand, the enchanter's (think magician - pet
class with dd's stuns, slows and damage/run speed
buffs) team leader's last report indicated that they were
overpowered, apparently easily soloing oranges (think
yellows from EQ) up to 20th.  I've heard the same from
Cabalists (Sorta like necros, kinda.  Pet class/life taps/
dots/health transfers).  If a Hibernian Druid gives up some
healing, they get a great pet, and are apparently awesome
soloers.  Their pets do take exp, as that was the only way
to balance them against non pet classes.  While some
pet classes have had that exp penalty reduced, druids won't
because of how powerful they are.  (getting half exp from
a yellow is as good as full xp from a blue, and druids spec-ing
Nature/Nurture can easily take yellows (even con or a bit above).)

Casters are certainly not gimps, just different from EQ
casters.
