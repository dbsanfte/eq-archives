I haven't gotten high enough yet in the crafting; maybe you can answer this
question for me.  If I focus towards Weaponsmith, will I still be able to
craft armour?  Obviously I'll not be able to make the very best armour, but
will I still be able to create a decent suit?

I like it.

A lot.

However, I do also recognize that a lot of people don't like it.  What I'd
like to see them implement as a compromise / solution is a simpler method
that can be used to produce quick-result low-quality goods.  (Say, something
similar to EQ1's current way of doing things - stuff 'em in and press a
button.)  That way those who want to dabble can use the quicky method while
those of us who would dedicate ourselves to crafting can use the current
method to craft medium to high quality goods.  All you'd need is an extra
button on the Forge - Combine versus Craft.

If they take the current system and dumb it back down to match EQ1, I might
as well stay where I am.  Odds then would be that I won't bother with the
game.  I want to be a *skilled* Paladin / Smith.

I wouldn't object to them adding a low-quality quick method as above, as it
would satisfy a lot of borderline crafters; those who want to be able to do
some of their own work but don't want to put as much effort into crafting as
into adventuring.  Just as long as they leave the medium and high quality
stuff to those who are willing to really work at it.

One of the things that I really *hated* in SWG was all the time I spent
finding the very best quality materials I could (12K units of spectacular
neutronium steel) and then finding that it made no difference at all in the
quality of the result.  (They hadn't correctly implemented it by the time I
left.)

I think it's good that they've not made things quite *that* number-crunching
in EQ2.  I would, however, like to see more drops of variable-quality ores,
hides, and woods.  Lower-quality stuff can be improved by skilled
workmanship into higher-quality, while higher-quality can be ruined by
unskilled workmanship.


Just, please God, don't let them create quests like the Coldain Shawl and
Ring quests, where everybody and his dog winds up becoming master craftsmen
in half a dozen tradeskills.
