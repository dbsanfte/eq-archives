Why not?? thats 3 groups of 2 aimed shots in under 2 seconds,  assuming
the robbers knew what a machine gun sounded like.  Assuming I'm prepared
for this, and 8 rounds per pistol, thats 16 rounds in 3.5 seconds,
dropping and retrieving 2 more revolvers from a handy drop holster takes
1.5 seconds, we are at 5 seconds.  and 16 rounds into 8 persons,  rinse,
repeat, 32 rounds into 16 persons, rinse repeat, 48 rounds, 24 dead or
wounded.

learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
