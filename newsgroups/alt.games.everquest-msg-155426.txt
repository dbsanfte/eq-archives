Actually no. I play a Wood elf Warrior, and a Wood Elf Druid both female (
Not by choice really its a guild requirement for the guild Im in, all
female, all elf team ). I can say though that Ive only ever been hassled
once, and the hassler promptly got PK'd by my wifes 1/2 Ranger. End of
hassling there, as he was a human that hadnt bound in G-Fay yet, and was
ticked he was going to have to wait for the boat again in FP. If I remember
correctly he even dropped enoug plat for my Druid to get her next level of
spells ;)

All in all though the people that Ive met on Vallon zek have either been 1)
S.O.B. random  PK'ers, 2) Nice people who are a pleasure to group with or 3)
Notso nice people who keep thiwe mouths shut, as they dont want to get thier
heads handed to them.  Only met a couple of #3's, and Im happy to say that
they left me alone after I killed and looted them ; )
