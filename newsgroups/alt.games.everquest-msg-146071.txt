That's especially true in many raids when you consider the HP buffs that are
available.  On a Kael raid the other day, they buffed my Wizard up to
something like 2700 HP.  With that many HP, it takes a lot more than the
usual "oops, nuked too soon and so the mob came over and whacked me a couple
times" accident for me to be in any danger of dying.

The only time I really came close to dying on that raid was right at the
start.  We were pulling random things to the WL zone and killing them, I
suppose to clear the path to where we were going, and also because people
were still gathering.  We got something that was pretty tough, and had it
down to about 1%, when it suddenly gated.  Everyone is standing around,
trying to figure out what to do, when I point out that we haven't really
started yet, so there IS a zone line about 3 seconds away we can use to
clear aggro.  Right then, someone gets summoned, which brings home the point
that we really need to deal with that mob, either by getting to it and
finishing it, or zoning out *now*.  The call goes to zone out, and everyone
turns to run.  Meanwhile, I see that the mob is actually running back to
us...and it's health is still very very low--maybe low enough to take out in
one Wizard nuke.  So, like Gandalf, I make my stand.  I nuke.  That triggers
an update of the mobs HP bar, and I see that it actually has healed up quite
a bit, and I have no chance, and I get summoned, and it is very mad at me,
and takes about 2400 of those HP before I can get away and run to the zone.

Anyway, with 2700 HP as a Wizard, if I need anything more than healing
during downtime by a secondary healer on a raid, something has gone so wrong
that it is not *healing* that I'm going to need from a Cleric.

The one problem I see this might have is making people with high AC too safe
against lower level mobs.  Consider a level 47 mob fighting a level 50
group.  A level 50 group should be able to reasonably take level 47 mobs, so
level 47 mobs have to be designed so that the AC that a level 50 is expected
to have is good enough.  Now consider a level 60 fighting that mob.  If the
level 60 has significantly better AC than the level 50, the fight will be
way too easy.

Perhaps the XP changes they just did are part of fixing this?  The basic
problem is that with the current XP system, it is almost always better to do
a lot of easy fights rather than a few hard fights.
