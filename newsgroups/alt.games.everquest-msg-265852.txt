The content is not even close to equal in accomplishment vs reward, a
consequence of mudflation. Also, old world has been "done", it is
boring now for many who have been there for so long. 

In the way that it does still remain equal - exp gain at some places
and levels - you'll find that the people who do go to the old world
zones tend to gain exp so much faster than those who don't. So its
still there.

WoW addressed that through quests. Quests reward extra exp. DAoC
addressed it through a bonus exp system for mobs that have been up
longer. Also a good system that discourages excessive camping. Does
instancing address camping at all? Seems to me in both LdoN and GoD
trials when we were fighting it was still sitting in a room and
letting the mobs come to us. We just moved the room we were sitting in
from time to time, either because of no respawn (LDoN) or undesirable
backspawn (GoD).

If LDoN had respawn, people would be camping in it exactly like we did
in KPC or Frenzy room. Obviously the solution has to do with spawns,
not instancing.

None of that is impossible or even harder with no instancing. If
you're afraid of killstealing all you need is one or two additional
markers, like a quest trigger or variable locations or other ways. But
no matter what, you're projecting a single group game onto a mmorpg. A
mmorpg can be much more than that, especially since single group games
like NWN and Morrowind do that *so* much better.

Maybe you guys would like Guild Wars....
