Personally I am more annoyed by accidentally inspecting somoene when I am
trying to con a mob than I am by having to turn inspect back on, on the
extremely rare occaision that I want to inspect someone.  Yes, I do know
about "c" to con, buy I am already on the mouse to put the cursor on the mob
anyway, and I may not be wanting to switch targets right at that moment.

Well, it's obvious, you cause them grief because you know when they inspect
you, and feel that it's rude, and perhaps even react to it.
