It's not quite as simple as that, alas.  Sometimes the hotkeys on
other bars will work with the bar hidden, sometimes not.  I think
it depends on what the key is bound to, but I'm not sure.  For
instance, my social for /autoinventory works fine with the bar
hidden (just tried it on my bazaar mule to make sure), but I know
that my bridle hotkey won't summon the horse unless the bar is up.
I suspect clickies in general don't work via the keyboard UI if
the bar is hidden, but I don't know what else works or doesn't.

Anyway, the OP's problem appears to have been that he was putting
stuff on page 2 of hotbar1, instead of in hotbar2.
