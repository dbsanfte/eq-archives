You totally missed the word 'unnecessary', didn't you?  Everyone will 
necessarily have to go outside sometimes.

Too late, I signed up for the beta and took the risk.  But I do resent 
having been forced to.  If you're fine with it, be fine with it.  But I 
think it was rude of SoE to require that.
