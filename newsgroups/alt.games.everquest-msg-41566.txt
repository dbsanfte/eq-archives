Go take 50 to 75pp and go buy Wu's Gauntlets. Then you can hit magic
things. You don't have to buy the whole set now.

Firiona Vie. To get there, take the boat from East Freeport to
Butcherblock Mountains. Then get on the shuttle boats in the other part
of the port. Ride them out to the big boat. Get off when you zone into
FV. Seek a bind in the city. Run North and west out of the city, and up
the stream and up the water fall, and zone into LOIO. Then run down the
left wall until you see the wind mill. Fight around there. And expect to
Feign Death A LOT along the way.
