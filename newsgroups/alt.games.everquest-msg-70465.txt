Actually, the problem is entirely Verants, as far as the skipping and
distorted music. No other games that I play have the slightest problem with
the SB Audigy that I have installed, and EQ's  sound/music problems are well
known to exist with many different sound cards, I've even tried a Philips
Rhythmic Edge that had the same problems with EQ.

You are quite correct about the SB Lives and the popping and crackling
sounds though, as many people have suffered with that problem, especially on
Via chipped motherboards. I believe that the two problems are seperate and
unrelated.
