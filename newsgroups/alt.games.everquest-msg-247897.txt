This happens to me fairly often as well.... can really get annoying when one
of the valorian guards in HoH basement spawns half under the floor.

Usually, I see them spawn, then they pop under... I can't cast on them ...
but while they are running toward me, they are popping above and below
ground repeatedly.  Even saw some of my wake the dead pets do the same
thing, although they were still able to hit the mob.

Relogging or zoning fixes the problem, just sucks to have to cast a new pet.
