No, but it looks VERY embellished by them (much paraphrasing)
British mainstream media is not really that far removed from their
National Enquirer like rags. 

For example, take this collumn thing that kelly flock said in the nov
issue of pc gamer, US magazine on page 168. It sounds COMPLETELY
different from that article where he is supposed to have made those
comments:

"about a year after releasing Everquest, we were asked to provide
copies of the marketing research we did before deciding to go ahead
with the project. We sheepishly admitted that we didn't do any
research because if we had, we could not have justified making the
game."

That is the only similar pargraph in fact it seems suspiciously
similar yet VERY different from what he was supposed to say in the
Edge, look:

"When asked if he takes into account consumer input Flock is
dismissive, relying instead on the expertise of his staff. "No, we
never talk to consumers - they just **** us up. Someone asked for a
copy of our market research which made us take the decision to do
EverQuest. I said we hadn't done any market research. Had we done, the
game would never have been made. We never focus on them. Gamers don't
know what they want. We just want to know if they have a valid credit
card." 

In looking at both of those which one seems like it would be more like
something someone in such a position would say? If you guessed the PC
gamer one you are probably right. He, and probably sony verant, could
likely sue the Edge for such embellishing which seems very likely to
be exactly what they did perhaps from a similar press info kit he
passed out or some source that they were both using.
