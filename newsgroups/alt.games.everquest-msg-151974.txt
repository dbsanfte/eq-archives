I had the impression it didn't scale at all, formed in discussions ages
ago with a wizard I grouped with quite often.  Come to think of
it though, she was woefully misinformed on a variety of topics I
happened to know something about, why am I surprised to find
her also incorrect on one I was ignorant of?

Sort of like Mend, you chose whether you want to use it as often as
possible to raise efficiency, or hold in reserve so you have it when you
need it.

Costs that to cast, but then lasts till you die or log out?  This is better
than POTC/BAOR, which have a casting cost and then must be
recast from time to time.  FT isn't germane to the conversation, we
were looking at comparing mana regen for druids and wizards.

Does manaskin stack with POTC?
