In the time I have been playing the game has grown well. Many of the
problems with the game like pelts that won't stack or combines that destroy
whatever you may have accidentally dropped into a pouch have been fixed.

Just because it is dramatically improved doesn't mean I think it is perfect.
It isn't just magicians that have problems with zoning, enchanters with
illusions and wolf form druids have the same problem with  their illusions
dropping when zoning.

They *ALL* suffer from a pretty grievous problem when they get a
disconnection. The pet classes lose their pets but the chanters and druids
come back w/o their illusion up. Try coming back from a disco in Oggok with
your illusion down to see what ogres really think of you.
