Heh, I remember being a newbie and hearing shouts like "Buying stacks
of batwings for 10pp a stack".  Of course, I hadn't known better and
was selling batwings to the vendor.  Hearing a shout like that made me
save batwings, but no more shouts came and I thought the guy was just
giving money to newbies in an innovative way.  Not having much
carrying capacity, I had to sell the batwings to a vendor... then came
another shout.  It probably took weeks for me to learn why people
wanted batwings. I  even hoarded them for myself thinking I might need
them someday, they seemed so precious... *sigh*  Those were the days
=)
