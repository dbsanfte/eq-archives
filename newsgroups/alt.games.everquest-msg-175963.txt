I cant say for the end game considerations, but at this point, My SK
is far better at holding aggro than my warrior (Iksar 53 warrior vs a
47 Gnome SK - yeah - ok - I sometimes play the unusual). In addition
to both having taunt skills, the Terror line of spells can turn aggro
around so fast for the SK. Quite often, I never lose aggro with the SK
(except when the wizards get an itchy trigger finger). The aggro for
the warrior is dicey. This could also come down to the fact that i
dont have great gear for either (i need a haste item REAL bad for the
warrior).

If I terror and taunt a few times with the SK, the cleric can heal to
her hearts content. With the warrior at the same level, it was REAL
iffy.

BTW, i havent heard the term "rolling" a character since playing AD&D.
Was kinda nice to hear that again (even tho theres really no rolling
stats in EQ).
