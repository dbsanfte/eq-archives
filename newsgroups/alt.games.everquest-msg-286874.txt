I didn't have zone alarm, only whatever XP SP2 uses.....

Well <blush> after trying everything I could think of, I powered off
the modem and router for a few minutes and when I powered them back
on, presto, access. Now, what I don't understand is why it was only
EverQuest and the EverQuest area of the Sony site that wouldn't work.
Everything else was accessible as I said before, including the EQ II
and Vanguard of said Sony site.... First time I've seen this in 6
years of playing......
