Well, no, not as of yet. This weekend, though, probably tonight.

The guy is an IRL friend of mine, and has already hooked me up with some 
pretty damn fine items (RBG and Barbed Dragonscale Boots come to mind), so 
I don't have any doubt that he'll hook me up.

Finally, FINALLY, CIHYS panned out... and I didn't even have to say it :)
