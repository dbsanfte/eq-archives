At 34 you get one of the better tools in the cleric kit bag; Atone.

Unlike the fairly useless calm/lull, Atone is not a disfunctional
harmony substitute.... it wipes the hate list.  Like Mem blur,
it may not wipe it completely with one application, but it sure
does improve the odds.

I'm not sure where the Wrath comes in on your plan... stun to buy
time, root to buy a good deal more time... and then wrath to break
the root and increase your aggro still further?  Try stun/root/atone
instead, I think you'll be amazed how much less the mobs go after
you or the chanter.
