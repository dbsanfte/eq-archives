Kinda off topic here, but I have a hard time with enchanters that won't cast
clarity on me when I am standing in front of them, while they are NOT
fighting and offering 30pp (yes, I normally offer this amount of cash for
clarity, have since 25, and no I am not a twink) and sow/whatever buffs they
may want for their party.  A prime example is in Thurgadin, I was in front
of the bank and did an "/ooc Paying 30pp for clarity at bank will buff you
and any party members as well" (I know I can't sow in Thurg, but a 49 shaman
can sure as hell buff).  Not one offer was given so I did a "/who Enchant"
and saw that there were 5 enchanters in zone, and that 3 of them were next
to me when I did my /ooc for clarity.  I realize the odds are good that 1 or
2 of them were afk at the time but I know one of them was not.  I even
hailed him, asked him for clarity and still got no response.  So, is there
something in the coding of the game that doesn't allow for Enchanters to
hear (see) requests for Clarity as they come in?  This is just one example,
actually, the reason I can usually pay 30pp for clarity is because I can
never find anyone to cast it on me.  There are exceptions of course, (one
guy offered free clarity for life when I gave him 50pp =), but not too
often.
