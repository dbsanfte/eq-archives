Don't assume this. It depends heavily on what international routes your 
ISP is using. A lot of ISPs these days use the Southern cross link to 
route ALL of their international traffic. This is great for US bound 
traffic (less than 70ms) but means your traffic will go via the US 
before anywhere else. This of course means the US servers will probably 
be faster for you than one in Korea. Do a traceroute or use your ISP's 
looking glass to the particular EQ server for a definitive answer.

Here are a few looking glasses:
