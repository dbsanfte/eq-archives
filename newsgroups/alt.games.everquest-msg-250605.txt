Instead of using Mem blur, try charm killing; when you break charm on a 
mob its hate list is wiped, so anyone doing the remaining damage gets 
the kill.  This is similar to the mem blur plan, but it works every 
time, instead of the "hmm, wonder if this will work" that mem blur and 
Atone provide.

Trouble with either method is that its well suited to killing one mob at 
a time... but for the PL-ee to get the exp, he still has to be able to 
do the remaining damage himself, so the mob can't be -that- much higher 
level than him.

For really efficient PLing, nothing beats a druid, with a combination of 
regen (which is much more efficient than healing) and DS, the PL-ee 
needs to be able only to get in at least one point of damage per mob; he 
doesn't have to finish off a mob, he only has to outdamage everyone else 
hitting it... and since DS doesn't count as damage from anyone, even one 
point is enough to do this.  HP buffs (for a better margin of error), 
SOW (in case of emergencies), heals... its as though the class was 
deliberately designed as a PLer.

Best way, IMO, for an enchanter to PL someone who's dramatically lower 
level than himself is to get that someone into a full group, and come 
play "big brother", buff up the group with clarity and haste and some of 
his other list of goodies (his DS doesn't hurt, its just not on 
druid/mage level, so on and so forth), and perhaps play puller for the 
group.  Group exp is a lot better than solo exp, and the buffing the 
enchanter can provide will boost the performance of everyone in the 
group, so his boost isn't watered down by the other 5 people there.

Once the PL victim is much closer to your level, it becomes worthwhile 
to do the charm kill approach, basically turning them into charmers 
themselves.
