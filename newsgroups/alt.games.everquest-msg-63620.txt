  Actually, the delay is fixed and is not the faster of the two.  The
damage, however, is the larger of the two.  That was one of the bigger necro
pet nerfs a while back, to my understanding (I think the nerf was executed
before I even began playing).  Necromancers would give their pets a weapon
with a really low delay (like fine steel daggers) and they would be hitting
for the relatively "high" barefisted damage with the really low delay of the
FS daggers.

  I'm not sure if pets can use tree flayers or hammers of flattening, but I
know they can't use weighted axes. :)  Now THEY would make one awesome pet
weapon.

  So it would seem to be a minor improvement to give your pet weapons that
proc, but given the recent proc nerf, it probably overall doesn't make all
that big of a difference.
