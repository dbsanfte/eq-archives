don't have the "it wouldn't be in the game if they didn't mean for us

creators of the world know whether the faeries have given any reason
for paladins to be killing them or not better than any of us do. Your
"plot hole" is based on assumption.
/quote

That is the context of the first of my posts you quoted above.  Its
removal denied context to my post, which referred specificly to what I
just quoted, and thereby made your dodge appear less flimsy.
