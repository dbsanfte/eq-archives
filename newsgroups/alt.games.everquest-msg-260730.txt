I keep on hearing all this talk about spiderling silks.. it cost me around 
600pp to get to 70 in tailoring..
It's called basket weaving.. you only need to goto shadowhaven...merchant 
sold...and used later on for baking too (misty thicket picnic baskets)

So leave them poor spiderlings alone...and stop feeding them overcharging 
whoremongers in bazaar!
