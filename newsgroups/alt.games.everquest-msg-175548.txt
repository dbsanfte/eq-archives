For you non-ubers and those ubers who can remember what it was ike before 
uberdom:

What is the recommended strategy for killing this guy?  We're going to kill 
him ( or die trying ) tomorrow morning.  Our current plan is to have the 
CLC DA then imediately hand in the item and run back to us at the zoneline 
for the battle.  I'll be stunning to interrupt the casts, and if one of the 
pallys show, they'll help in that regard.  He's not unstunnable, is he?

I think we're going to have:
52 CLC, 51 ENC, 53 SHM, 53 WAR, 61 RNG, 55 DRD, and a couple more melees.  
Maybe another CLC.
