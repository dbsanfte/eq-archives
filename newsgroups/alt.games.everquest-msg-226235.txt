   You would think so, wouldn't you?  It sounds perfectly reasonable, after
all.  The problem is, that the flood of testbuffies was for the most part
comprised of little drips idiocy that through the shear force of their combined
annoyance factor forever linked the state of being a buffie with the state of
being an asshole in the minds of most test regulars.

    I started several testbuffies.  I wouldn't have anything do to with anyone
else who was level 25.  There were groups where the warrior didn't taunt, the
cleric didn't heal, the enchanter didn't mez, the rogue didn't backstab, and so
on.  The infancy level in HHK got so out of hand that a GM got fed up and turned
everyone in the zone into PvP, red named as if they had done the Priest of
Discord quest.  The shouting and /ooc reached new stupendous level of inanity. 
And the bodies.  Bodies everywhere, littering every corner of Norrath and
Luclin.  

   It was grim, on many levels.  And to the regulars of test, being a
testbuffie, especially from another server, mattered.
