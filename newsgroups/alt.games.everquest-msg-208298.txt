Mana recovered is Pet HP/10 - so the buff would give an extra 22mana
back.

Sol Ro items (I'm going by memory)
Stein needs mermaid scales from sirens in OOT - good
xp 9-12
Torch needs a fire drake scale from LS drakes - also
good xp from 12 up (in terms of old world xp, obviously
PC shatters them)
Broom needs a Griffon feather, drops from Griffawns in
the Karanas - soloed my first one at 16.  Duo with
a shaman you might be able to take them when the shaman
is 14 (new slow).
Shovel needs a gargoyle eye (OOT) soloed them at 20.

Torch, Stein, Shovel, and Broom drop of Magicians in
Najena, duo xp them in your mid 20's.  Najena has a 
100 ZEM (compared to PC's 160).  They also drop off
the alligators that used to be in CT and are now
in the Feerott.

Giant toes are another matter.  EK has cyclops that
are soloable at 24 and drop the toes for the broom.
Hill giant toes (shovel) are doable when you're
34 (duo).  Your best bet for fire/ice giant toes is Gornit
in OOT (and he drops HG toes).  If you want to get
the foci before 34 you can easily get toes there from
the person camping him (HG, FG toes are the only ones
I didn't do on my own.  I managed IG toes in a group
in Everfrost at 34)

Finally there are gems that are 100pp or so each.

Since you are untwinked, the chances of you being
able to do more than 1 or 2 foci early on are low.
I haven't checked prices for the najena drops in
the bazaar.  If they are low enough, and you can
get the money together for the gem, I'd recommend
getting your Stein as soon as you have the cash
for it.

The only thing that bugs me about flare is the recast timer :/
Otherwise great fun if you get some elevation, it used to have
unlimited range, don't know if that's still true.

Native pet DS is pet_level + 1 (up until the #%$@ post 50 fire pets)
So (again, my memory may be a bit hazy - when I was leveling the pets
were variable level)
Level 4 summon (level 5) has a 6pt DS
Level 8 summon (level 9) has a 10pt DS
Level 39 summon (level 33) has a 34pt DS
Level 49 summon (level 41) has a 42pt DS

As you can see, the 49 pet has a MUCH bigger
DS than Lava shield (25) which the mage
gets at 49.  Also, recasting a DS every 6min
(8 with flameshield) is a SERIOUS pita.

Axe of the iron back is a decent weapon.  Unfortunately pets can't 
wield the weighted axe (50dam/150delay) as it is large race only.
