If I had any interest in playing my warrior anymore, I'd have to go to
dawnshroud peaks and check out these incredibly wimpy mobs. I must have
been mislead. I was under the impression, from various conversations
here and elsewhere, that Luclin mobs tended to be harder than old world
stuff.

Here's what I can tell you. The *light* blue mobs that I ran into with
Jakugg towards the end of his really active playing days, were not
soloable to any degree. I'm talking elemental warriors in the Hole,
Seafurbies, chickens in TD, things of that nature. *Usually* I could
kill one solo, but it would take me well below half health and down into
dangerous territory. One bad run on the RNG and I was dead or trying to
limp for the zone line for my life. If I bandage up to half (yes, I
still haven't gotten up to where I can bandage higher) that meant
sitting on my ass for.... oh.... well I suppose I could go mow the lawn
before the next pull.

And by the way, that's with crappy gear that's considerably better than
your crappy gear. I still have a couple pieces of crafted on me, I
think, but mainly it's barbed ringmail BP, three pieces of cobalt,
couple of Hate Armor drops, and a mishmash of other odds and ends. SSB
for helmet also. And no, I didn't see anything close to what you are
describing.

This leads me to one of three conclusions:

One - You're full of shit. But I don't think that, because I don't
recall you ever seeming to intentionally lie about stuff here.

Two - Dawnshroud Peaks mobs are so incredibly low on HP and AC that I'm
in shock there's a melee left fighting anyplace else.

Three - There just might be (this is not sarcastic, just I have no
experience to judge it either way) a HUGE difference between low/light
blue mobs to a mid fifties and low/light blue mobs to a mid forties.  I
did absolutely ZERO soloing in my forties. Maybe it was still feasible.
The last soloing I did was level 35 to half of 36 which I did on the "a
skeleton" they added in to Najena for the Ghoulbane quest. Did the
entire level and a half in like two sessions with backpacks full of
summoned bandages.

But no, James, with considerably better gear (but not "Ubah") than you,
I don't see a post fifty warrior soloing well at all. Not unless these
shroom patch mobs are as totally wimped out as the things you're soloing
in Dawnshroud appear to be from your post. I wouldn't know, having never
fought in either zone with a melee. I could only speak to their MR and
ease of fighting them in groups. But as for old world mobs, no. Sorry.
Not buying it, because I've tried on occasion, and it ain't happening.
Warriors suck at soloing unless they are *extremely* well equipped with
some nice special items to make up for their glaring weak spots. And
even then, they are barely soloable.
