   Shaman are fun, yes.  But also consider the
ranger.  At level 9 they get spells, and so far
I've had no problem soloing mine.  They are more
fighter than spellcaster, and get goodies like
dual wield, kick, and double attack.  The main
problem I have right now is that healing spells
we get are very, very weak, and are quite simply
useless in battle.  All they do is reduce the 
downtime after a battle, which is of course a
Good Thing.  
   But the best thing about being a ranger is
having good tracking; the best in the game, in
fact.  Once you get used to having tracking, it
gets harder and harder to play other characters
that don't have it.
   Druids get it also, btw, after a certain level,
but it maxes out at 50, I believe. I'm sure that
if I am wrong about that, I will be corrected.
   Clerics are fun also, and very good for that
"feeling wanted" thing you get from just about 
any group that doesn't have one.  I've only played
a druid up to level 6 or so, but had fun while
she lasted.  The problem is that everyone and 
their 15 year old cousin plays a druid, and it
shows in the reputation the class as a whole has.
And since there are so many druids, it seems to 
me that there is more competition for the limited
amount of gear they get.

            have been druids
