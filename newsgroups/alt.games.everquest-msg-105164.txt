While it doesn't stop FoB from being perhaps the best newbie zone in the
game,  I remember having that happen several times.  And being quite annoyed
each time.  Ended up always pulling mobs to one of the ramps, instead of to
the wall.

Heh, I ALSO remember I learned the hard way to not camp out while sitting on
the wall.  Some screwy geometry going on in that zone for sure.
