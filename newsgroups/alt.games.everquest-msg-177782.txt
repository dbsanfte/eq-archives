Because some mobs agro through walls.. just because

In outdoor zones, walls arent "solid" objects (they don't block AE's for
example, like an indoor zone wall does).. nothing is solid outdoors, not
just walls

Btw I don't know what level you were, but the only time I had the inside
fort (elites/oracle etc) agro me, I was hugging the wall.  I don't recall my
level, when I was exping there... lvl 40?  Anyway, running anywhere else
except ON the wall, I had no agro problems.
