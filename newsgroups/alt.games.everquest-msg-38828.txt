I used to feel this way.  I've come to realize that sometimes the dubbed
version sometimes changes slightly or even leaves out entire plot points.
Sometimes it's not so bad.  Other times it's almost unbearable.  Since the
advent of DVD, you can now choose to hear the dubbed and read the
subtitle.  I'm always amazed at some of the differences.  For example,
there is a spot in Princess Mononoke where the difference in sub and dub
of one sentence changed, at least for me, my impression of a characters personality
Don't get me wrong.   I'm not a die-hard subtitle nut, but there are time when I
prefer subs over dubs.  Voice acting can also play a part in the preference.

I saw Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The Emperors Assassin in the
theater.  That's the way to see subtitles.  They're not so bad when they are
three feet tall. =).  I fear those two movies in dubbed format.
