I saw one auction that a person used one of the EQ emulators to equip
a character in ubergear and max out skills/etc. He then provided
screenshots that were very valid and unedited showing said gear. What
gave him away was a couple of GM only items and 1 custom (not
availiable in real EQ, made for emulator server) item. Perhaps this is
another such case?
