Also, don't forget one of the best items a Wizard can own - namely the Staff
of Temperate Flux. This wonderful item will aggro your mobs as you run past
them, no Wizard worth his salt should be without one of these. This Staff is
a quest only item and is no-drop. The quest isn't *that* hard, but you may
need a few friends to help you obtain the hearts that you need.

Stevie.
