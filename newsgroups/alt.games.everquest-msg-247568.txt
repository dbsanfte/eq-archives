Actually I've been in TONS of groups with only one real melee and we did fine. 
The group was usually something like this:
Paladin or Warrior
Cleric
Necromancer
Wizard
Chanter
Mage

Or, throw in a bard or shaman.  Killer groups!  *IF!!* the tank is rock solid. 
If he's playing in gear made for someone 10 levels lower or has no concept of
*taunt* it can bite for the cleric.
