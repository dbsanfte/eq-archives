Actually, that's just one highly publicized suicide much more directly
involving the game.  I can assure you that there have been more EQ
players than just the guy from Wisconsin who have killed themselves. 
I know of at least two more, and there are probably plenty I don't
know about.

They just didn't kill themselves in squalor in front of their
computers with the login screen up.
