I finally got in around 5:30pm last night, after about an hour and a
half of trying.  So I do what another poster suggested and headed for
Dyllan Starshine.  Yes!  He's up.  I start whacking away at him.  I'm
punching him WTF???  I had left a summoned hammer as my weapon the night
before.  So I go into my backpack and grab my fine steel mace and start
banging on him and add smite to the equation.  Before he's dead he runs
and gets the big rogues to help him.  I take him down.  I start looting
because I know I'm going to die.  Before I can click (YES I WANT THIS
FUCKING NO DROP ITEM) I'm dead.  Pop!  Into the fire pot room.  Quickly
I port into rivervale and start running.  Through Kith, I don't care if
its night, I gotta get back.  I'm running.  I show up.  The corpse is
still there!  I click the corpse.  Yes its all here!  5 seconds later
someone walks in asking me about Dyllan.  I'm so jazzed, I loot my
corpse not remembering to Rez myself.

Well, then re-organize my spell book.  And after that of off to get my
testament.  So I gate into the firepot room, zap myself over to Halas,
and start running to Qeynos, killing bears along the way for fun and
profit.  Well, my second bear, there sits a HQ bear pelt!  WooHoo! 
Score number 2!

So I go all the way to Qeynos, play cards and get the Jester on the
first try!  WooHoo!  ToV only cost me 6 gp.

I think I've got a good thing going now, so I head over to the Warrens. 
I go toe to toe with the Kobold Prince.  I win.  And what does he drop,
but the Bracer of the Forlorn.  Score again!!!

It doesn't even bother me that I accidentally nuked the scion and died
instead of summoning food shortly after that.  I also bought several
items in the new bazaar.  All total last night, I raised my wisdom 28
points, spending less than 100 pp.  That should help with tradeskilling.
