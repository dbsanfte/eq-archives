When we wipe on an xp camp, I just accept the fact that the camp is in
danger. I've been grinding some AA in PoN lately, either solo kiting or 
partnering with my wife's necro. We've wiped a few times from bad pulls, 
adds, trains, etc. (And I refuse to train the graveyard unless it's 
clear that I've got such a lead on the mobs I can click on the stone 
well before the mobs get in aggro range of the GY.) Usually we just 
root, mez, put-pet-on adds while I cast an evac, but it doesn't always work.

When we come back, if somebody has started pulling at our spot, I'll 
usually aske them once if we can have the spot back. If they say they've 
got the camp now, I move on. There's lots of places to get xp and it's 
just not worth getting into a bunch of angst over.
