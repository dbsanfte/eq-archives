As Kaev said, it's much closer to 2 ticks per bandage.   Each bandage I do
heals 90 points

Looking at the necromancer spells, I have to go back to the level 39 DoT
before I find one that does less than 45 damage per tick.

I'd consider being 26 levels over that to fit my statement of "If bind
wounds would save you, you were hunting way below your level."
