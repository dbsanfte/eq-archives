There are many item links that can be pulled from the EQ itemDB that are not
in circulation.  Many are GM items, some test items, they are more than
likely, not meant for PCs.

Unless you see someone wearing it (inspection), then suspect whatever it is.

If you log your chat you can frabricate items using item numbers to link to
other items in the EQ itemDB.  You wont have them, but you can make some
pretty funny links (i.e. Can of Whoop-Ass, etc.)
