In their 50s, with no AA and a bunch of missing songs which won't come 
out till future expansions?  Oh and no FT either, so their mana regen 
would be in the toilet even if Fade was in the game?

What I've found with bard pullers, besides those factors, is that when 
the bard leaves, his songs stop, so our hp and mana regen drops.  If he 
leaves during combat, we also lose haste and slow or whatever other song 
combo he's running; its usually pretty noticable.  Since in group 
situations, we usually have either enchanter or bard as CC if either, 
we're probably relying on bard for mana... I'd rather see almost anyone 
leave then him.

Thats a long way in the future, we have yet to open Velious, and 
depending on what's required to open Luclin... well if its defeat the 
sleeper, we'll be old world forever!  Even wake the sleeper will be a 
long time.

Ah that explains it; I can't think of a time when I tried this both FD 
and making sure the pet lived.  I tried FD but didn't worry about the 
pet surviving, I tried making sure the pet lived... but not both at once!

So, now I need to know the level of each of my pets, and the approximate 
level of the mobs I'm attacking, and what the "green" level is for those 
mobs.  That way, instead of summoning my smallest pet (who is unlikely 
to survive) I can summon the biggest one who is still green to the targets.

Lets see, it would also be best to get him HP buffed, and if possible 
SOWed... which begins to turn this into a real PITA, as I imagine even 
with my best efforts I'm going to end up losing him fairly frequently, 
particularly to caster mobs.

I agree, there are usually better choices than a main tanking SK as 
puller... except that I've grouped quite often with people who have even 
less will to pull than I do.  I want that next mob right away, they seem 
to sit around and wait before pulling, trying to get everyone back to 
full mana and so on.

At any rate, there are times when I'm not MT, and if I'm not MT I'm 
probably the most expendable member of the group; my DPS doesn't come 
close to any real DPS class, I don't have particularly useful debuffs 
(Combine server means about a quarter of my spell list is missing), I'm 
certainly not a healer or CC other than being able to offtank.  I figure 
if I can get my pulling skills up, though, I'll still have something to 
offer in those situations.

That said, I'm not sure why you are having

Yep, I have a tendancy to use Clinging Darkness for anything but fear 
kiting; its cheap and fast casting, works well enough to stop runners 
and seems to generate the same amount of aggro as Engulfing or Dooming, 
the other two snares I currently own.

Its been a while since I experimented with this, too, I think I did try 
it with my best snare in case that was more effective... but when I did, 
Engulfing was my best snare!  This would be another classic example of 
an old catchphrase of mine, "Verant Teaches Us Wrong".  (thats how old 
it is).  Which is to say, what works at low levels doesn't work at high 
levels, and what works at high levels doesn't work at low levels; 
instead of exploring the class while you level up, you have to reinvent 
it several times as you go.

I've been doing this in SF and have yet to see the feared add return. 
The adds in this case are all chromodracs, and SF seems to have a max 
follow range of some sort... but for some reason, when I don't FD, the 
chromo or perhaps its friends end up coming back fairly often.

Based on what you've written above, I have a theory as to how and why 
this is working as I observe, see what you think:

Lets say principle target is a Wurm.  I aggro wurm directly with 
clinging darkness, it charges for me.  I sic pet on it, with taunt off, 
it puts pet second on its hate list.  Chromo adds due to sloppy pulling 
on my part (I've run too close to it, or its popped too close to me or 
the wurm) but doesn't put my pet on its hate list.  I fear the chromo, 
it runs off.  I get back to the fight spot... and here is where the 
difference comes in:

A) I stand there and wait.  Wurm eventually gets to camp, we fight, 
meanwhile chromo is still running, paths close to another chromo, who 
social aggros and heads for me.  Even if initial chromo never comes 
back, I'm swarmed by whatever buddies he pathed near.

B) I back pet off and FD.  Wurm follows pet in since its the only 
"living" thing on his hate list, Chromo, on the other hand, has nothing 
on his hate list so doesn't pass aggro to anything.  By the time wurm 
arrives, Chromo is so far away that when I stand back up, whatever 
buddies he paths close to are too distant to come attack me.

I find myself in sub optimal situations quite often; for example I'm 
soloing or have a partner who's mana situation is more critical than 
mine, or I'm in a group with two SK, or just two tanks, or I'm on a raid 
where I'm not MT ST TT... pretty much just baggage.  If I can develop 
some pulling skills, though, perhaps I can be useful in more situations. 
  The guild I'm currently with, for example, has been using a ranger as 
puller... not because he's the ideal class for it, but because he has 
the skills to do it (and doesn't mind dying half a dozen times per raid)

Besides, if I learned to pull as a mage, surely I should learn to pull 
as an SK, who has some actual pulling tools at his disposal!
