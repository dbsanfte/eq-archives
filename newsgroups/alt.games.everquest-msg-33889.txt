I had an idea that could perhaps provide a solution to the naming
situation, while keeping everybody more or less happy, and I think it
could even be implemented within the existing framework of EQ:

At the outset, everybody picks a name from the random name generator. Of
course, they don't have to pick the first one that comes up, they just
keep rolling until they find one that they find acceptable. At level 5,
they get to pick a "Nickname" of their choice. This would be very
loosely bound by naming conventions (i.e, no obscenity), but otherwise,
it would not need to be on character (although it would have to be
unique). Then at level 20, they get to pick a Surname. For this, there
are two ways: Either by hand, or by choosing from a list of acceptable
beginnings (Leaf, Glade, Ghoul, Cloud, Evil, whatever) and endings
(walker, runner, bane, whatever), or else from a list of family names
provided (T'Vil, McManus, Masterson (=P), Bayle).

What would make the idea workable is a relatively simple system of
filters client-side, i.e, Display only Names, only Nicknames, Names and
all Surnames, Names and only Acceptable Surnames, Nicknames and
Surnames, etc. Perhaps this could be even more fine-grained, like
keeping all Names and Nicknames on, but if you find one particularly
bothersome, put it on a special filter, so you only see their randomly
generated Name.

I think this would keep everybody more or less satisfied... Any glaring
holes in the scheme that I may have missed?
