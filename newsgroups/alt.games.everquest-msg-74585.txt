Killing guards can give various faction hits.  The "guard faction"
takes the biggest faction hit and goes to KOS status much faster than
the other factions.  Say these guards con green.  An NPC whose main
faction is one of those other factions that take a minor hit per guard
killed.  The NPC cons blue.  If I'm killing guards and neither the
guards or the other NPC are KOS, but the other NPC sees me kill a
guard, will that NPC attack?  

As an aside, one of the guards cons light blue so I don't kill him.  I
was killing guards and he didn't react.  I reached KOS status with the
guards and when I went to loot, he bolted from his station to attack
me.  

In case you're wondering, these are the Misty Thicket guards at the
hole in wall, and the NPC I'm concerned about is Ella Foodcrafter.
She comes by and drops off food and runs away, so I may have just been
lucky in that she never come by while I was killing a guard.
