  You only need one key rule:  No out of genre talk anywhere but the OOC
channel and private tells.

  No requiring anybody to roleplay a certain way, just make it against
the rules to use numerical statistics, and make it against the rules to
use modern slang or terms.  It isn't "roleplay fascism" to make it
against the rules to use l33t d00d sp34k, or forbid one from talking
about their computer's specs, or a modern's sports event, at least not
in my opinion.

  You weed out the worst of the OOC/OOG behavior, perhaps implement a
few of the rules you suggested, label it an RP server, and viola. 
Perfect?  No.  Better than the normal servers for RP, though.  And
whatever Brad wants to say, the normal servers aren't RP servers.
