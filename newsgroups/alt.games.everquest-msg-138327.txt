With focus items, and the availability of cheap stuff from the bazaar, most
druids should be able to quad something at 35 nowadays. I used to have to do
root kiting at upper 50's, but I find now with my obulus death shroud that I
can quad all sorts of things. This is nice because it means most LD's will
be out of combat and not hurt me. Looks like my druid will have mental
clarity 3 pretty soon. Does anyone know the title for female druids with 12
aa points? (Venerable? Lady? Mistress?)
