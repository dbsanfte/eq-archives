    I don't think they CAN learn from that. Dan - if I show you an item, can
you tell me off the top of your head, or even with a bit of work, what level
ranges should be able to get it for each race/class combo on it, and what
the next best item is in that slot for those race/class combos? And if
there'll be an extra "desire" factor, like appearance? That's an involved
task - yet every quest item HAS to be evaluated that way to determine what
level mob it should drop from. Put it on a mob too high, it's "vendor
trash". Put it on a mob too low, and now you have a bunch of REALLY angry
folks where before you just had farmers.

    By leaps and bounds, and it's the best thing I've ever seen. I have yet
to hear of a game that even mildly made me want to leave EQ.

    Because they don't want people to leave after a few years. They want
people to be so hooked they'll linger on for years and years. And the people
most likely to have the emotional attachment necessary to force that are
people with well-developed characters that cannot be quickly replaced should
the person come back to EQ.
