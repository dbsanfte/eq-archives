Some questions, answer as many as you want, thanks in advance :
1) I made a druid, can i find/buy additional spells beyond those I started
with ? In that case where can i find them ?

2) Is there a maximum level for episode 1, does that change in "attack on
queynos".

3) Can you change difficulty level to harder after you start a game ? hoping
for some "cheat mode" =)

4) Is there other towns exept Freeport and Neriak where I can buy armor and
weapons ? What are the best places for a druid except Freeport ?

5) There seem to be houses to the east of Freeport, I can see them on the
map but I can't get over there ? Can I , and how ?

6) Is there some list of zones in the game ? Can you direct me ?
