From the shadows, the mysterious "Jeff Lindholm"
<jeff_news@lindholm.org> (if that IS his real name) conspiratorially
whispered:

>I am sorry, I know your news reader of choice makes you more of a man than
>someone who uses outlook express. What was I thinking.
>I bow down to your greatness in being able to use what ever news reader you
>want. Personally I don't want to install yet another piece of software when
>I am smart enough to use the piece that is already installed.

But not smart enough to know it's a pos.


>Personally I would rather nothing was quoted then people might actually have
>to read the entire thread instead of just the piece you decided to quote.

What you would "rather" is irrelevant and inconsequential. If you're
unwilling to learn netiquette, you learn the hard way - by no one
reading what you have to say.

Kinda defeats the point of communication. Unless you are talking to
hear yourself talk, of course.

Usenet weeds out the weak. You are part of the problem, not the
solution.
