Why would they agree to never wake him?  Other than the fact that him and
his four others never respawn, what is so bad about waking him?

Also what all (in more detail if you know more about it) happens when he
wakes up?  Are the events he causes temporary or permanent (and if not
permanent, do they leave any form of permanent effect, like NPCs
occasionally talking about the event)?

Also what are some of the GM events mentioned that have had permanent
effects, and what effects did they have?
