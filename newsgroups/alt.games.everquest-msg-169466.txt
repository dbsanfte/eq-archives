You have almost exactly the same system I have, except my graphics card is a
GeForce4 Verto PNY MX440.  But the Radeon should work at least as well...
hmm... if you were just getting lag I'd say get a better internet
connection, like cable or something (believe me, cable is awesome :) ).  But
since you're freezing... hmm... I don't know... get more memory maybe but
512 should be plenty I would think... I've got 768 but I don't think you'd
need that much... well, I'm stumped.  Ask someone else.  Course, if you'll
pay me a couple hundred dollars I'll come look at your system and fix it in
a day, guaranteed.  :)
