No, I get that.  What I'm saying is, as the title of the thread reads, 
whats wrong with these people who are not buying the more fuel efficient 
option?

Its not about the car manufacturers, who as you say, are simply not 
continuing to make something people aren't buying at the moment.  Its 
not about me not being able to buy the truck I want; I just did buy that 
truck, and given the rate of technical innovation and the flex in 
customer demand, can't predict whether what I want will be available 9 
years from now.

I'm talking about the millions of truck buyers in this country over the 
past several years who have cleary trended in the direction of the 
vehicles with lower fuel economy, and who the manufacturers predict will 
continue to do so next year even more strongly.

If you're using it to pull heavy objects, then it makes sense to get 
something big enough to do so, and not barely big enough either.  I have 
no quarrel with that, just as I feel justified getting the F150 instead 
of a Subaru Brat, because I need more cargo space and more hauling 
capacity.  I simply doubt that 90% of the buyers of the V8 auto actually 
need that as opposed to the V6 manual.

Actually, the auto/manual thing is a completely different arguement, to 
me, automatic is giving up control, giving up flexibility, giving up the 
ability to have power when you need it and yet to have greater fuel 
economy when you don't.  Driving something with an automatic 
transmission (rentals, the occaisional long drive switching off with a 
friend in their car) always makes my skin crawl, its as though you put a 
trained monkey in charge of the stick shift, and blindfolded him so he 
can't see whats coming and has to shift based solely on whats happened 
in the past few seconds.

I hear that these days the trained monkey is so good at his job that his 
fuel economy isn't really worse than that of the average driver who does 
his own shifting.  I'm still carrying a decades old bias that makes that 
hard to believe (no engine braking, for example, unless its on the 
hybrids, where they take the concept one better).  But its going to be 
difficult to convince me that he's going to be able to respond to 
difficult situations better than I am, or that I'm going to feel happy 
if I end up in an accident where a little downshifting for emergency 
torque or for added braking could have meant the difference, but nobody 
told the monkey.

I'm not convinced of the "for my kids safety" arguement.  If thats the 
sole reason to buy an SUV, then you'd probably be just as well off 
buying a Volvo station wagon or other mid sized vehicle with a high 
safety rating.  Yes, SUV's generally fare better in a crash, but don't 
they also roll over more readily and generally get involved in more 
crashes?  Further, don't they do more damage to others in those crashes? 
  Marketing SUV's as needed for safety is a viscious cycle, people buy 
them to make their kids safer, then there are more accidents, and people 
who aren't in SUV's get hurt more, so everyone ends up buying an SUV to 
protect themselves.
