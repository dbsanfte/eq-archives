Do you say the sky is blue or the sky is cyan?  I say either choice is
silly, for there are many shades to the sky, and stubbornness is no
virtue.  State your opinion, but remember that belief in absolutes is
a fallacy.  If your eye can see millions of colours, why can't your
mind?   Say you blue or cyan, remember the many shades of each.

Whenever you find youself in a "me" versus "them" situation, it may be
time for some soul-searching.  Perhaps, grasshoper, "them" have a
point.
