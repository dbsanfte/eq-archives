I will second this.  Our little raid gaggle has gotten done 2 War 1.5s, 
2 SK, 1 Pal, 1 Nec, 3-4 shm, 1 Dru, 1 Clr, 1 Rng, and I'm not sure about 
the # of Rog 1.5s done.  We are close to getting 2 monks through as well.
Harest to date has been the final fight for the Cleric (which we blew
3 times...).  We tried the bard gig in DN once as an after raid attempt
and got obliterated heh.  One attempt on the evil Girplan in WoW for the
Wiz 1.5.  No mages, BLs or Zerks on the raid crew.  They are all doable
just have to be on the ball and if you need to. Take more bodies.
