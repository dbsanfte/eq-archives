We raid every night (when theres mobs up) but if someone wants to miss a
raid occasionally thats ok. We dont feel we "own" them, just that we expect
them to *want* to raid with us.
Maybe if we had to race other guilds then we might require members to drop
things immediately, but the only other guilds doing our content are in a
different timezone.
