As far as I know you need something that says magic to be able to hit
creatures that can only be hit by magic.  Cured silk isn't magic.  I would
start saving some plat to get some wu's gauntlets perhaps.  I just recently
bought a pair for 40 platinum (although I'm sure price will depend on how
new your server is).
