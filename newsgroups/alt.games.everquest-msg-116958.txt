Yes, had to do some experimentation because while standing in N Freeport
bank, I at first thought even my stein of moggok was giving off a light
source equal or more than a greater lightstone.  Turned out the fire beetle
eye was making the walls be almost a very light yellow, then the stein made
them a bright white.  After playing around and equipping/unequiping the
stein of moggok I realized it wasn't changing the light, but removing the
fire beetle eye was actually GIVING off more light in that area.
