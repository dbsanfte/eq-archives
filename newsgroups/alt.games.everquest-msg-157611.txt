I don't think you know what you want.  You get into a raiding guild
knowingly, and then want to explore.  To make matters worse you voice your
desire in guildchat several times?  I see where you and Jazz go back and
forth a bit, but it is cut and dried.  You are trying something you are not
fully prepared to ante up to.  You might want to start looking for a more
suitable guild, I don't forsee you be allowed to stay in your current one.
