    Bah, you did this all wrong! If you wanted the loot tables to be fixed,
this is how you do it:

1) Claim that blue diamonds are dropping off tatterbacks "a lot", has anyone
else noticed this?
2) Get one supporting post saying "Yeah, and those Ruby Crowns too! I got
two off one ape!"
3) They will panic and look at the loot table, see those items can't drop,
but HOPEFULLY notice that the loot tables are borked and fix them while
they're there.

    You know they won't just test this on a live server as they never seem
to do that. 8/
