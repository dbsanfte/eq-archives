Probably a bit more, however, once you hit the 51st level, your higher
level spells do not get any easier to cast.  For instance, I have a 52
level druid with max Evoc skill.  Evoke maxes at 235 for Druids.  I have
had times, when casting 'Breath of Ro' fizzle a bunch of times in a row
before I get it to stick.  I have had my XP at 50/50 right now, gotten 1 aa
point into Wis.  My only good reason for taking longer in raising levels is
to make money the old fashion way, killing IGs and taking time, milking it
as long as I can before all of them become light blue and make me move on
to kill other things.  Another reason, I have a friend who plays
sporadically, more so than me and I want her to catch up with me so we can
group again and have fun.

Personally, having a little extra wis for my druid, even if it is only 2
points per aa point, helps when I level, saves me the trouble of spending
hordes of money trying to get that nice uber acrylia studded cloak that
hits me for 6k where I would have to hunt for a lot of money for it, or
spend time running around like a port-merc to drum up some cash to get the
10Wis.  This way, I can get XP, get money and work at getting the Wis,
spending money on things that can't be done this way.  At roughly 500 to
1000pp a day just doing the mindless grind (Sound like RL work)...  Getting
XP for it and gems to finance the enchanter's jewelmaking skills...
Milking Giants slowly is very profitable.  Especially when you can't
guarentee the time to go into the dungeon crawls and disappointing players
for only being their half heartedly.
