Well, I went back solo, and discovered something really important:

    Every mob in burning woods seems to have as any hitpoints as a ravishing
drolvarg, hit at least as hard and be MUCH harder to hit, but gives the same
loot as, say, a rager, and the same experience. In 3 hours there I managed
half a yellow of experience.

    Thoroughly dissapointed, I returned to nex, renewed c3, and ran down to
the Dreadlands. Sick of them though I had been, I knew damned well the
experience was at least twice as good. 2.5 hours later I had hauled 1.5
yellows by selectively pulling dark blues. Poo-poo to the burned woods I
say. I also discovered late in the day that donating to a nearby chanter for
augmentaiton (forget aug in your 40's, I found a use for it in my 50's ho ho
ho I feel like such a tool now Ben) kind of boosts my total haste from 21%
to 51% and makes the monsters fall over quicker. Dah Kuloth.

    I returned the next day and dinged 52 faster than you can say
"speedofvallon" and discovered that my new pet, true to my expectations (33
instead of lvl 25?) hits like a room full of pissed off black dudes that
someone's just yelled "NIGGERS" at. In one of those mean american cities
where the black guys beat on you for that too, not a weenie one where
they're nice. Anyway, as per the plan I took him back to rathe mountains and
began having an absolute ball. At 45 those giants were a nasty challenge, I
needed to drain the life out of half a camp of lizards after every HG fight,
at 49 they became 300% easier and I managed 700pp in three hours as my best
score out of that place.

    At 52 I go through those giants like this NG goes thru new posters. I
now start fights by sending the pet, beginning to cast darkness (pet usually
tails behind me a bit due to SOW and tends to agro the giant just before or
just after dark lands). Pet actually holds agro despite the mob being hit
with a 300point dot / 60% snare, which makes part II extremely easy. Without
needing to backup or pull any kind of evasive crap, I wait for my spell gems
to get all coloured and hit fear. This lengthy period of tanking a Hill
Giant barely dents the new pet's hefty hitpoint bar, and his ludicrous regen
rate means he heals up during the fight. Fights last about 40-50 seconds
without haste or less than 42 seconds with. (fear lasts 42 seconds - when it
breaks I get the option of nuking, tanking through or recasting fear).

    Last night, Kuloth staggered out of Rathe with 1,190pp of stuff he
hadn't gone in with, a very fine score. Unbelievably, he now has enough
money (3.2k atm) to buy ALL of the gear he's got a second time, except for
the Black Acrylia Halberd, which would cost the same again or more.
Suddenly, the up until now seemingly impossible task of getting my alt's
smithing above 200 seems within my grasp again, albeit with a hell of a lot
of plat farming required. It's one of those beautiful situations where you
finally see a clear path to the completion of your goals.

    If only real life would mirror eq in that respect :)

    As an added bonus, looks like the resist gear Kul will want after he
dons his uber cultural armour will be easily within his grasp also :)

Cheers,
James

PS Flames can be directed to that brick wall over there. If you see an
innacuracy by all means correct it, if you dissagree with something I've
said by all means say so, but leave the flamethrower behind plz.
