I'd use them for:
1. Disarm trap (PITA to find a trap to practice on (yeah yeah Paw but 
it's still a PITA) Cause you're definately gonna need it later (DN need 
I say more?).

2. Instill doubt (yeah ya don't really need it..or use it unless 
soloing, but looks funny when you and the monk both do it at the same 
time... kindof a tribal dance sorta thing ;) )

3. If you feel like it: Make and/or Apply Poion. If you don't wanna sink 
a thousand plat to get it to master it might be cheaper to train them 
up.

I'd go in that order.
