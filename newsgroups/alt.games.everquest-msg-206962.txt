Heh, one of the ways I've been judging mob toughness is by whether my
DoTs get full duration (10 ticks, 12 extended).  Anything we can kill
faster than my DoTs run out is too weak to be a real threat, if that's
all we're killing it's time to try timing nukes for a killshot or stand
up and get some melee practice in.  Of course, we're talking weapons
and haste items that L20 ghetto twinks on regular servers would sneer
at for the most part, so the melee damage in my groups is not what
you're used to (16pt DS on MT makes a very noticeable difference in
speed of kills, for instance).
