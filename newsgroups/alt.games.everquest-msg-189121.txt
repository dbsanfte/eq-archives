Want to upgrade my Boots and Arms (both Cobalt) with Teir'Dal Regent
armour...but few people sell it and I have yet to find a seller who actually
made theirs :ï¿½/ This leaves me with the daunting prospect of getting
Smithing to 250 and doing it myself...Any idea of the cost to of that? That
is the cost in plat and not to my sanity or wrist (which I know will be
high) is it even feasible to do this...or would it be far too much trouble?
Looking on EQTraders guide, other than general tedium, there doesn't *seem*
to be any real problems with doing any of it. I can farm Acrylia with little
trouble or just buy it from traders if I have to...obviously the attempts at
the actual armour are going to be a lot more costly.

Or should I just search out a Dark Elf, GM, Smith on Bristlebane?
