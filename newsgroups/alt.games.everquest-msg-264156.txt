Nice summary, thanks! My main partner from DAoC and SWG finally joined beta 
today (woot) and we'll be starting new characters on the Isle, so I'll have 
a fresh chance to scout those out again and finally complete this quest. 
I've figure out most of them myself (working on the Rat Queen in Vermin's 
Snye now, that was the basis for my double party wipe yesterday, ugh). This 
is one I hadn't yet solved. Nice job.
