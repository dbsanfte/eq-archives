Psymorph tells you, 'Hiya! Senior Guide Psy here. I'm afraid I have had to change your name as it can not contain a title such
as Queen. Would you like to choose a new one now?'
You told Psymorph, 'Sure, may I have a moment?'
Psymorph tells you, 'I will leave this one as temp and you can petition within 7 days from today with a new suggestion. Be safe
travelere'
You told Psymorph, 'Also, my real life kid is Amazonprincess.  Is that one also verbotten?'
Psymorph tells you, 'Aye, we will need to change that one to )'
You told Psymorph, 'I will petition on that account also.'
Psymorph tells you, 'Thank you very much'
You told Psymorph, 'Of course.  Thank you.'
