Everything has it's problems but overall his arguments don't hold water.
All the classes play the same?  There's not enough content?  It's not
interactive enough?  Sorry, but he's way off base.  Just because he hasn't
yet experienced the differences in classes, the vast amount of content and
enjoyed player interaction doesn't meant that it doesn't exist.  He didn't
complain about not being able to figure out how to play or to understand
spells, catering to high-end, or any of the things you said were problems
with EQ.
