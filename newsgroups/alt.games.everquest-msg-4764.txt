I don't know what stripped drivers are but that might be the problem.
Download the newest available for your card and try again.

Not sure about the video card, check out
http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/audio_video/supported_video_cards.
jsp
and maybe download the reference drivers.

I had that same problem a few patches ago and finally ended up just changing
my default OS (dual booting) back to Win98 in disgust...but supposedly they
fixed that problem.

I use a Linksys router (the $150 one for broadband) but it's not doing
anything fancy...just default settings except I changed its MAC address.

If you dual boot, try your other Win OS to see if you still can't get in.
The next thing about EQ is that you don't have to reinstall it, just create
a shortcut to everquest.exe.
