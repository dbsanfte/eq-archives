Wow, someone who doesn't empathize with anyone else.  You're a real
winner.  Why don't you post your characters' names so we put you on
our "don't group with" list?

Listen, Clerics are providing a service that costs them money when
casting those Symbols on you.  Yes, it benefits them to do so, but it
also benefits the rest of the group (including you).  So, the group
should soak the expense, not just the Cleric.

Learn how to share.  It's a basic living skill and most grade schoolers
could teach you a thing or two about it.
