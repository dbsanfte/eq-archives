I never even considered not snaring the mob before rooting, happily
not having started Druid till long after the root/snare stack issue was
resolved.

Nukes, on the other hand, break the already fragile root.  DOTs on
mobs that are chasing you are actually less mana efficient than
nukes are... so DOTing something and then breaking the root seems
silly.  If root would last full length nine times out of ten, then the
root/dot plan would work pretty well... but thats far from my
experience.
