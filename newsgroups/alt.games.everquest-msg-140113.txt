Last night I was playing with a guy dual-boxing a cleric and a rogue.  
All of a sudden the cleric disappeared.

Cleric_01 tells the group "lol thought I was on rogue_01. gated. was 
trying to hit BS."

Although far more amusing was when we had a group consisting of 
monk/monk/monk/rogue/cleric/enchie and the pulling monk said "can I get 
a sow plz?"  I said "Okay, you tell me which one of us can sow you and 
you'll get a sow."  Monk_01 says to dwarven_cleric "you're not a 
druid??" cleric replies with obvious "no, I'm a cleric."  Monk_01 turns 
around and looks at cleric.  monk_01 tells the group "thot bald haffer 
hehe... it's late"
