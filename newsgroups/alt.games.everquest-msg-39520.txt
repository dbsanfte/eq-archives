Hmm.  A skilled player could use any of the following, which might be at 
his disposal:

1) Sow, of spell or potion form
2) Follow the bard!
3) J/TBoots
4) That nifty trick where you run while strafing, that I could never 
   figure out... Shift-Left Arrow-Up Arrow?  Something like that.
5) Occasional jumping is rumored to move you faster, until tired.
6) Dropping the @#$%! copper/silver/rusty/FS/Velium Weapons that are 
   encumbering you
7) Realizing you're set on 'walk' for some dumbass reason, and fixing it.
8) Possibly getting a better videocard?
9) Avoiding trees. :)

Did I miss any?  I was busy trying to get AoE mez to stick... and only 
having it stick on me... And then having gate interrupted...
