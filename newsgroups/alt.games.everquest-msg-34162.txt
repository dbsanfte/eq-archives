Something kind of similar happened to me.

Arootha(Iksar Monk): Wanna go to (some place, can't remember)

Me: (no response)

At this point it's obvious he knew nothing about me, seeing as I had
/annonymous on. He was level 14 and I was level 3 (I had just started the
character) so it seemed he was just doing random /tells for a group.

Arootha: U there?

Me: Yes.

Arootha: Do you want to go to (some place)

Me: No.


That was the end of it. I should have petitioned him, but didn't. Oh, and as
an afterthought, someone was KSing me EVERY single time (and since I was in
the FoB and was constantly aggroing scaled wolf pups, that was a lot). I
asked him politely several times to stop, then  I started /rude ing him and
asking him to stop. He didn't stop until I threatened to /petition him. Just
as a question, is it acceptable to /petition someone for repeated Kill
Stealing?
