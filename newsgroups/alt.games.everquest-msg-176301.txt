For permanent changes, theres...

Levelling - increases HP for everyone, increases saves for a few classes
AAXP Levels - increases HP, stats, and saves


For temporary changes, theres...

Spells/Effects/Procs - change lasts as long as buff does
Gear - change lasts while it's equipped
Food - change lasts while it's your current edible
Drink - change lasts while it's your current potable
Alcohol - change lasts until you sober up
