Get this, I was helping out a friend and this guy walks up to me and demands
buffing. I ignore him, so he starts making threats to my friend, saying he
will log on as another character and train him at his bind point... this
isn't a PVP server btw! Now i told my friend to just ignore him, but that
makes me wonder; how do you report someone to verant for making threats?
Even if they were idle ones, my friends pretty young and was rather scared
of this guy, especially as he could easily have carried it out?

naturally I bound him in another zone, but I think it's a sign of the time
that beggers don't just ask for your mana, they try to mug you for it.
