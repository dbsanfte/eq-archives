The problem would also be solved by any design that doesn't include camping
for rare valuable static spawns.  Instanced zones, nodrop items, or flags to
prevent anyone from looting a given item more than once would all remove any
harm from monopoly farming.  The reason for farming doesn't matter - it's as
annoying for twinks, selling for plat, giving to friends, as it is when sold
for RL money.

Umm.  This is true of money in "real life" too.  It's a shared consensus
reality, get used to it.

>If you remove the effort needed to get them, they have no meaning.

That's silly.  The value of an item has many components, one of which may be
pride in acquisition.  A purchased item slays dragons just as well.

Only if you think the effort was worth more than $50.  In which case you made
a mistake by spending too much effort rather than buying it.  Personally, I
think the effort is it's own reward, and the epic a nice side effect.  Someone
buying it means they don't get the fun of questing and fighting, but doesn't
effect me at all.

We both get the value of the stats and effects of the epic, but I got mine for
free (actually I received fun while doing it) and he paid cash.  So what?
