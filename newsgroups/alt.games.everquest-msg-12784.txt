More importantly, Warriors can stay alive long enough to be healed.
Enraged Velious ubermobs can deal a *lot* of damage *very* fast.
Complete Heal takes 10 seconds.  Warriors have disciplines that
can keep them alive long enough to get a CH.

Also, many of the Velious ubermobs are highly magic resistant, so the
things Paladins and Shadow Knights have that at lower levels give them
the advantage fail.
