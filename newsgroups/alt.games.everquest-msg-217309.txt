He didn't specify "while" meleeing. As far as I'm concerned I'm a melee
class and I just happen to do far more damage from a distance.
That being said I know that there are plenty of better equiped and AAed
rangers out there that do pretty darn close to the same damage as archery
(non TS) and Rogues are just insane when they get a good high level high end
poker. Against Undead with Slay a Paladin ain't no joke either.
Further the only pets I've ever seen delivering the kind of dps he's talking
about have been charmed mobs. I've never seen any other pet bust 100 on any
parse I've ever done.
