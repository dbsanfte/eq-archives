The chanter pet is a very poor companion.  Once you have three stuns and can
stunlock a mob, it can be a valid tactic to pull with a slow, get hit once
(on a rune, by preference) to activate the pet, then stunlock the mob so it
can't hit back while your pet chews it up.  Takes a while, but it will work
for a few levels.  Overall, the best enchanter pet is a melee - I prefer
rangers and paladins, myself.
