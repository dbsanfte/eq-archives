just ignorant.. why have they chosen to blow themselves up?  ask yourself.
judging from your post, you don't know.
isreali oppression is teh answer... and you don't have to take my word for
it.

http://www.zmag.org
www.truthout.com
www.amnesty.org

see for yourself... the isreali military doesn't even respect their human
rights (as outlined by the U.N.)
The Amnesty site has an article on just that... find it!  in that article
you'll also see how many palestinians have died becuase of the isreali
military.
there's something CNN will never tell you.

their choice of retalliation is a wrong one, but we must not forget what
they are retalliating for... a much bigger crime commited by Isreal.

"self-genocide"... that's the most stupid reasoning i've ever heard.
