..............."we shall not include the transparent Inventory (that was
included with Velious) into Luclin"

I bought Luclin mainly for 2 reasons, the updated gfx (which are *very*
nice) and the transparent inventory (it'll be a while before I venture onto
the moon)- well 1 out of 2 ain't bad I suppose.

Ok I admit, Luclin doesn't actually state you get the new user interface but
surely if you release an expansion with new texture/graphics etc that add to
the original game then you should include everything that was great about
Velious too?

Anyway mini-rant over, as I've bought Velious as well now, but....can I
install Velious interface over Luclin or do I need to re-install all the
expansions in order? My RL guild mate installed Velious after Luclin and for
some reason still doesn't see a transparent inventory (still switches back
to 640x480 mode) he says all the expansions are enabled as is 'use same
resolution'. Is there a special way to activate the new inventory mode?

Many thanks for any advice. :-)
