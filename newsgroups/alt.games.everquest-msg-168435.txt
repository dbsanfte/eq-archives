Well, not really camped in this manner.  But camped via having a ShowEQ
person zone in every few hours.

The "Taunting Blow" weapon is a first tier drop.   Rare (or semi rare?) from
the Junk Dragon in Plane of Innovation.

Actually, considering that the dragon is spawnable every half hour that he's
not actually being done, and the weapon is better than or equal to
willsapper, he's probably the upgrade method that I would suggest for a
"midrange" guild like my own.   Vanikki is easier, but this mob you can
actually get... ; )

I looked into buying one for a while.  I haven't verified it, but the
general opinion seemed to be it was "slightly less" aggro, and "slightly
more" dps.
