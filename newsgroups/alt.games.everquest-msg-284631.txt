You don't have to bind in a city, just not in a dungeon.  I don't
understand why you couldn't bind in Dreadlands, perhaps specifically
because of where you were located?  Yes, Kael and Thurgadin are good
suggestions.  But another good place nearby would be next to the Nexus
Scion in Great Divide.  I think some of them are unattackable but the
one in GD is still fair game as far as I know, and as I recall, should
hit for 1 or 2k damage?  (I managed to get her threatening to me a
month ago but the only time I ever took damage was as a newbie, several
years ago.  Back then I seem to remember getting hit for more than 2k).
 If you are not KOS to Claws of Veeshan, you could just go bind near
TOV.  Naked and level 63, those dragons will kill you right fast.  Most
of the animals in Natimbi are dubious as I recall, and should be blue
or light blue but perfectly capable of taking you out over and over.
Maybe just bind near the turreptas or down near the water on the main
Island?  Can't you still attack the guards in Freeport?  If you are not
KOS there, maybe just run around tagging the militia patrols?

You could also just bind in any outdoor zone near KOS mobs but safely
out of range.  There is a nice empty corner near the wall in WOS where
you can just endlessly run to Velitorkin.  Can you bind in Stillmoon or
the Ascent?  Maybe Noble's or Bloodfields?
