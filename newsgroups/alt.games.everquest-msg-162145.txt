Sorry - I am on a EQ sabbatical, but does EQIM stand for EQ Instant
Messenger? That is a rather interesting marketing use of EQ's inability to
ALT-TAB back to the desktop and use your regular programs isn't it.

*wonders idley if EQemail and EQbrowser will follow suit*

Maybe if you give them enough time you will not need to alt-tab back to your
desktop as for a price and extra individual monthly subscription you will
gradually again regain the ability... nay - the <privilege> of multitasking?

Anyway currently enjoying Total War: Medievil and Age of Mythology.
Battlefield 1942 is proving to have some lasting interest for a first person
shooter too. More importantly beer is still the same price without EQ though
I did ask a puzzled bottlo last week for a carton of Blackburrow Stout, I
hope that isn't habit forming.

It is interesting sensation to read about the latest SOE Patented Ass
Pineapplings from a nice safe distance though. The tales of woe are like
nicotine patches that can be reapplied whenever I get the urge to
re-install... *twitches* - let's just read the newsgroup first.... aaaaaaah.
