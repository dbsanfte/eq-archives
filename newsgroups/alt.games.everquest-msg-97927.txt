I think that it is two fold.
The changes to sub level 10 will let new players get addicted before
they get frustrated (which makes good business sense) and they will alow
oldsters to uber-twink and level to 11 rapidly thus bypassing the "I
don't care if you are a cleric you must tank for 8 levels" PITA.

I still have not got to high levels due to time restictions etc. These
same restrictions that are making it hard to get to high levels will
also make it hard to play at high levels. If I can only play for an hour
how much could I get done at level 50 ? So making the low to mid game
better definatly helps me.

Hee hee. The fact is that if you get a guild that wants a new cleric how
long will that cleric spend on levels 1 to 10 ? Or even levels 1 to 30 ?
If people want to blast through levels (and have the contacts) they can
do it now.
Ask your self how long did it take for the first beast lord to be level
60 ?
