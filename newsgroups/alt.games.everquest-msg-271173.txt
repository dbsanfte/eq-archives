Generally no, you wont use food and water in trader mode.  But if you are
selling stat food etc, its a good idea to keep some food / water on you to
stop from eating those on your bank trips.

Have to buy trading satchels (only bought in bazaar), and keep them on that
character.

Yes, this is generally frowned upon due to the spam it causes, and I believe
that if somebody petitions you while you are AFK, you can get kicked.  Thats
if they can find a GM.

Personally I would prefer bards to do this in an out of the way place so as
not to spam people, but tis up to you.

Just check the prices of stuff before you price it up (in the baz window),
and base your prices on that (undercutting is not always the best thing to
make pp btw).
