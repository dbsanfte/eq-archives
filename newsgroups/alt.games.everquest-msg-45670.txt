Connection really has nothing to do with it.   I had a 56 K  modem that had the
X2 capability and would hook up at 115K or so and went LD often.  Since then, I
now have a cable modem and last night I went LD 3 times in an hour.  
    I grant that there would be a lot of cheating going on, but there must be a
way for the EQ program to read your ping bar.  I have never gone from 0% to LD
instantly, it has always been slowly from 0% to 100%.  The program should be
able to recognize the difference, but my guess is that it would cost $$$ to do
so and therefore is not an option.
