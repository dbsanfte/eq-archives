    Those leezards have an ugly damage shield - was the cleric MoK'ing, or

    Upper Dogs in Velk's for a few hours before helping a friend mark grade
six science projects. Made half an alternate XP point, and because the group
was one of those "we hate EC, just take it" groups I came away with two

Terrorhide Boots. Grats twinks. 8)
