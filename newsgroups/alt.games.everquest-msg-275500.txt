Lol, that's awesome.

What they should've done is made it in game... you have to actually
show up at a Pizza Hut, hail some apathetic teenager behind the
counter, and order.

You say, 'Hail, Lothar Pizzakeeper!"
You say, 'Hail, Lothar Pizzakeeper!"
You say, 'Hail, Lothar Pizzakeeper!"
Lothar Pizzakeeper says, "Welcome to [Pizza] Hut!  Would you like to
hear about our [specials]?'
You say, "What pizza?"
Lothar Pizzakeeper says, "Buy one [large] with your choice of
[toppings], get a second for only $5!"
You say, "I want one large with pepperoni."
You say, "What large with pepperoni?"
Lothar Pizzakeeper says,"I am woefully low on pepperoni.  However,
perhaps you may help me.  I hear [rumors] of a foul beast living in
the wilds of Odus."
You say, "What rumors?"
Lothar Pizzakeeper says, "A terrible beast stalks the woods at night:
the Ronimancer.  Bring me his fang, and I shall bestow great [rewards]
upon you."
You say, "Screw that, I'm going to Domino's."
Lothar Pizzakeeper hits YOU for 756 points of damage.
Lothar Pizzakeeper hits YOU for 1272 points of damage.
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...

(Sorry about the EQ1-isms, I haven't played EQ2... but oh the
possibilities.)
