We plan to play Two accounts at a time. May be difficult to be so geeked,
computerized and EQ dependant heigh enough to connect all the familly at
once lol. Someone must feed the geeks, grow childrends, cook, clean, arrange
the house, pay factures and earn money at work LOL.

By the way ISDN connections in france are 64Kbs per channel vs 56Kbs in the
US. It may be woth a try to connect 3 EQ accounts at the same time. But will
this resist massive raids with many players to update at once ?!

Anyone tryied this already ?
