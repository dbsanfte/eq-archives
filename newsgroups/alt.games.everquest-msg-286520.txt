Ridiculous assertion.  There could have been 99.9% testing complete and 
they didn't test the one AA you checked.  You've demonstrated nothing.

Look, I'm not a sony apologist, I think their current Formal 
communication is terrible, their latest producer's newsletter a complete 
waste of space, their marketing is crap but at least let's be honest. 
They test, but they don't test well enough, maybe due to resources, 
maybe due to skill, maybe due to other reasons, but to deny any testing 
at all takes place is just to be on the other extreme of fan boy.
