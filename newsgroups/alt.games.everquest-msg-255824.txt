Are you sure? I didn't have to pay anything for a few skill ups. I
know this because I dropped all my money on my other character then
ran to turn in a tome to my GM. The skills at zero cost zero copper to
raise. I used a few skillpoints to get one point in a lot of languages
and a few other skills I don't acutally use. But the cost was zero.
Might want to make a fist level character to take a look.
