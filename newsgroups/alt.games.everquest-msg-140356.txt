Now that is quite impressive.  Please inform those of us who have not
done rogues - what is so much fun about the class?  You could start up
a little army of rogues if only they were on different accounts. 
Maybe you can give me some incentive to start one up.

My question is, do the other classes not interest you?  Now, I can buy
that you wanted to do it twice, but three times?  I don't mean to
critize, to each his own.  But there is just SO much to this game, I
personally would hate to miss out on the diversity.

As a cleric, you are pretty well confined to a particular style of
play.  How many other styles of play have your pursued?  For example,
your druid is level 34.  Just as the druid gets through puberty, you
shelved it?  Try taking up quadding with the druid!  You'll never see
that with your cleric(s), and it's possible you may never go back to
the cleric as a result =)  (just kidding).  I prefer the wizard to the
druid for quadding, but since you have one readily available, go for
it.  Quadding is so much fun and is such a thrill.

How about playing the class that is the exact opposite of your cleric?
 Instead of being the master of life, be the master of the dead.  Try
a necro.

Perhaps you may want to see what it is like to play the other classes
in your typical cleric dynamic.  Try a tank class to get a feel for
what it is like trying to get mobs off the cleric.  Or an enchanter to
see what it feels like to control the minds of mobs.

If you have a tight knit group of friends that all want to start over
with you, perhaps you could each switch up your typical roles on the
new alts to give you insight on how to improve the group of mains.

I really don't mean this to be a flame.  If you are completely
enjoying a cleric, maybe sticking with the class (for the third time)
is right for you.  But I think that with a time consuming game like
this, you will never get a chance to pursue any other class to a high
level as a result.  There are forthcoming game titles that may divert
your attention in the near future.  I find that I learn so many
different styles of play when using different classes.  Furthermore, I
find that I am visiting a much more broad range of zones.

Given your history of this newsgroup, I think you can now change your
sig to be "Mr Cleric" =)
