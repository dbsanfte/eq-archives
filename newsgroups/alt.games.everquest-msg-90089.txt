For the recipe, also look at:

When you can sell it at all. See below...

The weight reduction is a mis-nomer in this case. Yes, the FQ is a
weight reducing item, but where quivers are concerned the weight
reduction value is used to calculate a delay reduction for the arrows
coming out of it.

The Fleeting Quiver has the highest weight reduction of any quiver,
and hence has the greatest delay reduction. For a high end archer,
this translates into increased damage per time.

Unfortunately, this isn't at all obvious from looking at the stats
in-game. You see "weight reduction" on a quiver, and rightly think
"big deal". There's no way to tell that it reduces your archery delay
by inspection. This is one of those many little things that Verant
didn't bother to do well. The upshot is that many archers simply don't
understand how valuable such an item really is.

Verant has stated the weight-reduction to delay-reduction ratio, but
as I'm not an archer I didn't make a point of memorizing it. I
probably should have listed it on the FQ recipe.
