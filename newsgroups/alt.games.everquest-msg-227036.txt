Hell, PL'ing myself they last <1 hour.  2 or 3 hours in a group.
That's with 3k worth of bazaar gear and a loan of my BL's SCHW.

That's less than an hour with just a 56 BL helping out my little
bardling (mostly SoW and heals and the pet to finish runners.)  Don't
dare do it really fast because I refuse to let my defense lag - right
now it's 2 points from max with 20% left in the level.

A group of our alts was making a level every 2-3 hours at 30 without
that help - we had a druid with GH and were indoors, so the BL wasn't
much help and I didn't want the distraction while I relearned the 
timing on my twisting so I logged him off. 

Notice there was a 29 (then 30) druid in the mix - she did just fine
as our main healer, with a bard as MT.  Yeah I'm a *little* twinked,
about right in line with a /testbuffed warrior of the same level for
AC/HP, and behind them in DPS.  The tough part was using my dots to
hold aggro off the 25 rogue so he could BS.

Then we got a little goofy, my buddy showed up with his
lowbie wizard, and his 65 cleric, I logged in my 52 enchanter and
started pulling 20 at a time, Stun locked them with the enchanter and 
twisted my 2 ae dots while juggling lute/horn, the wizard and druid
were AE'ing - mega dead mobs :).  Hehe - parsed one of those pulls and
averaged 65DPS on my bard :-P  We were all getting 1-1.5 yellow a 
pull for the short time we did this.
