Ogre no learn to make potions. Ogre not smart enough.
Ogre no bake food. Ogre eat much much much food.
Ogre no brew drink. Ogre let you brew and Ogre get drunk.
Ogre no make pointy ended sticks. Ogre not forest hunter guy.
Ogre no catch food in water with pole. Ogre bash you with pole and make you
give ogre food, hee hee.
Ogre like pretty stones to wear, but Ogre no able to make them.
Ogre no make pot, ogre bash pot or bash you with pot.
Ogre no work with metal. Ogre bash green lizard with metal shield and slice

Ogre no tailor. Ogre hands too big for pieces.
Ogre good basher.
Ogre good meat shield.
Ogre sometimes need help of guys with green names because ogre get his fat
butt stuck in little place (really happened to me just over 8 months ago, I
have wondered if ogres, trolls, and barbarians have to get unstuck more
often than other races.).
