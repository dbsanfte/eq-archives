IMHO, spec are a lousy mob to quad - you get close they cast fear and kinda
slow down (slow already) and break up the pack.  That was my first payback
moment with specs, ran to the island, not a soul around, so I gathered up
all 4 platform specs.  What a mess, I landed some casts then in the process
of keeping them away from other players, bumped into them, they cast fear
and it really broke up the pack and cost more time maneuvering to get them
consolidated again.  blah hehe
