And with this post, you've automatically passed Bizbee by a mile in
the prick category. You see, while Biz often is a prick, he is also
often helpful. His prick percentage falls about in the middle of the
scale. But you've posted exactly once, and in doing so were a prick,
which means that you're 100% prick so far.

Congratulations.

Now, tell me, do you ever plan on making a positive contribution to
the group, or should I just killfile you now and be done with it?
