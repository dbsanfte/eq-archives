Mudflation really only hit me in terms of inability to sell the extra stuff 
I have for a decent price.  The only equipment I have purchased are two 
ornate items that were reasonably priced, but that, given time, I would 
have been able to get eventually.

Most of the time I have spent in EQ has been about spending time with 
friends, next in line would be trying out new things in EQ.
