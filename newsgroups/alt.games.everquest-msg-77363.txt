True, that. Oddly enough, I learned Linux before Windows. Went straight 
from DOS to Linux hmmm 8 years ago, picking up my first copy of Windows 3.1 
shortly thereafter. Doing administrative tasks *with* a GUI is foreign to me.

For the context of this thread, INN does work on most all Unix-like OSes, 
and there are NNTP servers for WinNT as well, such as DNews. So Linux
is certainly not a requirement.
