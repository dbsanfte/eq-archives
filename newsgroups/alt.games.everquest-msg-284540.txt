[details snipped]

I think it's safe to say that most if not all classes require full
attention to play to their best capacity.  But some classes, such
as wizards and clerics, can be played "adequately" more easily than
others.

It also depends on what level you're at.  At lower levels, mobs
aren't gating or CH'ing, and don't have as many buffs or resists,
so a lot of the wizard repertoire is less important.
