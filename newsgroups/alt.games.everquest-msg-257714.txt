Seems the shaman/early-slow thing really is based on level.  I can't speak
for what goes as XP grouping in GoD, but in PoP and everywhere lower, a
good shaman didn't NEED the cleric to patch them up when they got aggro,
because they quickly slapped on a Q after that early slow.  IN fact, my
husband several times got frustrated because clerics wouldn't listen to
him when he said he didn't want them to heal him.

That is assuming the shaman cannot be killed by a one-rounder. It also
didn't apply when we had a warrior as the MT, since they didn't need slow
on incoming so much, and since they couldn't have gotten aggro as quickly.
But when you have a hybrid as MT, not only does slow-on-incomming not
ruffle their ability to get aggro, but it really does reduce the amount of
mana needed by the cleric to heal 'em.

Or so's I recall.  Could be things have changed significantly. I do think
a lot of it has to do with the shaman.  We had one cleric friend who
regularly complained about shaman from pick-up groups about the same
things you say, but he just loved Rakyn...said Rakyn made his job too
easy.
