Also, the monk may have been a twink and had an assortment of
non-summoned bags of that type. (e.g bag of sewn evil eye, Rallik pack,
tinkerer's, etc.)

My wizzy has to watch weight concerns also, (not as bad as a monk, but I
have low STR and can't get encumbered when quadding) and I carry a
Rallik pack and should shortly have an EE bag also.
