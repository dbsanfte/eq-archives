Yes, /ho is short for /hotkey.  But how are you running out of
Social buttons?  There's what, 100 of them??  Or haven't you
noticed that the social buttons window has little arrows at the
top like the hotkey window does, to let you cycle through ten
banks of ten socials each?

Also, once you've got a social built, you can modify it (if you're
brave) by editing a file in your Everquest folder.  I forget if it's
the one that starts with your character's name, or the one that's
called UI_ followed by the character name.  Anyway, look for an
existing social and it's pretty easy to see how to modify it there.
