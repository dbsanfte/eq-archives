/shrug

Whats your explanation for why the zone populations never crank above 3 
then? And with all those midlevel players coming up the ranks too... the 
majority of eq players if SOE is to be beleived!

I'm interested in upgrading. Doesn't have to be to the biggest best 
equipment in the game... but it does have to be a forward direction. 
Many of the old zones are downgrades for what even a nontwink will have 
especially if he's spent any real time in LDoN or the Bazaar.

> But aren't you the one that usually sneers at "gamers like that"?

Yes. I'm one of the 3 people in those zones. I'm playing against the 
grain and I know that. I couldn't drag a group to half the old zones if 
I tried. Once they know the xp isn't great and the items are worse... 
well.. I can't really blame them; 

Even -I- want there to be a point to the zones I'm in... that is why I 
don't shop in the bazaar... and only wear stuff I've looted. Because its 
the -only- way for me to derive any fun out of looting in these zones. 
When I am in those zones I can still get upgrades. But even I don't plan 
to get a full set of velious armour... its nuts... it would take a year, 
and I'll be able to loot (nevermind buy) better stuff elsewhere long 
before I get a set of Velious.

VP was -just- revamped.

Beats the 0 in Kael.
Meanwhile Gunthak and Dulak were quite popular even before the pok book. 

LoY wasn't a bad expansion overall; but it wasn't great either. 
Velious was great... and Kael is still empty.
