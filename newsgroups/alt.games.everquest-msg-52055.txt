Go where the mobs are.
Kill lots of them.
Don't die.

Ok, you're probably looking for something more specific. You sound set
on soloing, but I don't know squat about melee types soloing there, so
you'll have to settle for some more group oriented advice. Go to the
spires around Splitpaw. If, by some miracle, there's an open spire, grab
it. (A quick "/ooc Camp Check!" will generally result in people yelling
out "/ooc North!" etc. if they are all taken. The spires have a fairly
fast respawn single Tec Mas Gnoll spawn. If you can solo them, you're in
business. Just watch out for wandering mobs. You may be non-KOS to the
aviaks, not sure, and the centaurs like everyone, but there are a couple
wildcard mobs to watch out for. (Giant undead cyclops, etc.) so keep
your eyes open. Or, get in a spire group. Easier, if slower xp.

Or, head on over to aviak town and look for a group there. The people
hunting it can likely show you the safest spots to pull to.

If neither of those appeal, stay in Nk near the bridge and pull birdies
and such to near the bridge zone. There are guards there and a zone line
if you get in trouble. Don't remember off hand which ones would be blue
to you at 26.

Other side of the zone line in SK, you can pull elephants and such to
near the bridge. Same drill, only no guards.

Good luck.
