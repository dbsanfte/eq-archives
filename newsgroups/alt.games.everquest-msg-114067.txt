I am glad to say I experienced this bug in all it's glory :) I was in the
Oasis, my group included a Mage, who spent about 60% of his time summoning
throwing daggers for the group.

The Daggers had Line-of-sight(unlimited) range... anything I could see, I
could throw a dagger at it. As soon as my dagger hit the target, I could
throw again.(0 delay).

Made pulling a breeze... which must be why we all died. we'd throw at an orc
1000 feet away, and he would aggro 6-7 more along his way back to us :)
