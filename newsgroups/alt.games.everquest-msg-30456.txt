*sigh*  Most of my characters are pure casters, and I don't really worry too
much about weight with my single level 20 monk right now.

Here's some information that may not have sunk in yet:  It takes ONE TICK to
loot something...I'm PRETTY SURE no one is going to die because you took 6
seconds out to loot your fair share.  LOOT UP, you're entitled to it.  Don't
make any apologies...in 2.5 years I've never EVER seen anyone bitch at a
caster for looting their fair share.
