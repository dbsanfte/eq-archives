So I'm tooling away on my epic here, and have already been with my guild
in a couple Ixiblat Fer kills, so I'm not worried about that one.

Is there anything I should know about Overking Di'Zok?  Looks simple
and straightforward here, two hour spawn with no PH, just bring in a
raid sized force and gank the heck out of him, eh?  His other drops look
mighty nice, too, a big improvement on the AC 6 +2 Sv fire robe and the
darkwood staff that are the grand total of non epic drops my epic mobs
have let go so far.

Then the only thing left is Ragefire.  Again, just a couple dragon
kills, nothing
outrageous... but I hear that this is the bottleneck that may hold me up
for months;
something about a list to kill him, and him on a 7 day spawn clock?
Where is this vaunted list and who do I have to sleep with to get on it?

either a couple days, or a couple years, from getting epic, depending on
how you look at it.
