	Logged in to see patch messages even though stuff's
still down...  The games wants a driver upgrade and the initial
screens all came up in 600x480 mode...  

	I'm glad to see they're spending time adding pretty pictures
to the UI instead of fixing meaningless bugs like geometry problems
("You cannot see your target") and stuff like that...  No :-)
