That's when you cast a Darkness line spell on a mob to slow it down, cast
one or more DoT spells on it to start killing it, sic your pet on it, and
fear it, not necessarily in that order.  Then while it's running away and
your pet is beating on it you can optionally cast lifetap spells on it to
kill it quicker, which is an especially good idea if you're killing a yellow
or red con.
