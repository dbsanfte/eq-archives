You are a barbarian?? Upgrade some/most slots to bronze. You also didn't
mention your str/agi(closeness to encumberance) Pick up a bloodstained
mantle(AC6 str 3 wt 3.5 40-50pp)Bracer of Erollisi(AC 5 Str 5 wt 1 
40-50pp) And a Spiked collar(AC 3 Str 3  wt .5  3-5pp)or Orc Fang
Necklace(Wt 1.00. +5 AC, +3 Str, +3 Sta, +3 Agi 50pp ) to handle the
necessary weight increase.  Also you didn't mention fingers and ears, 
Jagged bands(finger 5AC 3Str  60-100 per pair)  Orc fang(ear 3str 3ac
15hp 30-100 per pair) Cougar claw(ear 4ac 3str 2dex 200+ each)  Also
didn't mention boots, If you haven't already, shell out the 50pp they
will cost for some blackened iron  5AC 6.5 wt magic.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
