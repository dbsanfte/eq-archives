EQ and Zone alarm just don't work well unless you run EQ in windowed
mode.  Everytime the patcher updates EQ, Zonealarm will stop EQ and
notify you the program has changed and you need to click the notice
away.  In some case, you may need to restart EQ to re-establish
communication.

When you do get past that, everything is fine.  Do make sure you turn
off notices of attempts so you don't get bothered by numerous pop ups
from scanners, hackers, misdirected requests and lost web surfers.
