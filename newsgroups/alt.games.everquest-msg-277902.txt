Oh my god, congratulations on making a long process as long as it is
possible to make it...

Suggestion:

If you want to do the corpse summoning thing, make a group specifically for
that purpose, stick a bard in the group and whoever has the key, and sprint
for the rainbow (I could run all the way up to the rainbow without feigning
and without dying back when my guild was working on that, without bard
song).

Even easier, because corpse summoning sucks, and since your method you used
already involves fighting up as a raid, just have everybody hang out behind
the rainbow (in groups of 5) and have the person with a key die and leave an
item (not the key...) on their corpse.  That way you can have him take one
group up, have him rezzed back down to the rainbow where he switches to
another group of 5, rinse and repeat (no need to repeat the death, can rez
over and over).  From the moment you're standing at the rainbow, if
everybody is paying attention, this can be a 10 minute process rather than
an hour long deathfest.
