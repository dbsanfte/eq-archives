On the xp thing, IMHO raid xp should actually be slightly higher rather than
lower.

I'm sure that SOE is taking the position that, which enough toons, you can
essentially green anything, but I don't buy it. A raid mob takes all the the
"normal" skills plus extra skills in working together. Killing Sev in a raid
should get you more xp than killing your 345th willowisp in JP does -
period. Solo or no solo. In theory, a level is all about "experience". Did
you learn more and become a better "x" (where "x" is your class) watching
everyone work together on a major mob, or by doing the same thing by
yourself htat you've done 100 times already.

Nerfing xp because you're in a raid is just plain nuts to me. That said, I
otherwise love the raid window. It would be nice if it had an *optional*
health bar, but alas. Basically, I'd like to see any of the columns be
optional, and then add a health bar to it. I care bigtime about a person's
level and class when I'm setting up my raid or running my raid group, but
after the raid setup, I pretty much know who/what my key players are, and
I'd like to turn things down to just their name and a health bar and free up
window space.

JMHO.
