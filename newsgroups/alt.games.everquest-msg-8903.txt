Actually...I have to disagree with you here...princess is fairly intelligent
and extremely manipulative, I like watching her pick people apart when she
gets out of dumbass mode. Unfortunately her taste in friends sucks and she
enjoys degrading herself to Avenger's level of stupidity, most likely
because she's too lazy to be herself and it's much easier to just say
"duhhhhh."
