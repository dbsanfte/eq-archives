That doesn't answer the question of the OP, which is where does the pp come
from?  Your answer is remarkably akin to telling your kids that steak comes from
the supermarket, since thats where you go to buy it.

Question is, where does steak really come from?  Cows!

Where does PP come from?  Its not "from Ebay" even if thats how you personally
manage to acquire it.

It comes, as the OP said, from quests, from selling loot to vendors, and from
loot dropping off mobs.  Fourth source is selling tradeskill made items to
vendors, but this is fairly rare as far as source of overall pp in the system
goes, since these tend to get spotted and nerfed back out of existance.

Its interesting to note that very little of the cash in the game goes to
vendors, other than buying food and drink few people have any regular need to
take cash out of the system; spells are bought only occaisionally, and trade
supplies tend to result in items that are sold back to vendor at no more than a
slight loss.

I'd say quests are responsible for a very small fraction of the cash, although
they are a very nice starter (bard quest comes to mind as the simplest way to
make PP for level one spells) there really aren't many that pay cash at all, and
the ones that do tend to pay insultingly small cash.  Only reason I'd count them
at all would be those bard quests and the quests where you get reward items
sellable for cash to vendors; the CB belt quests and GLS/concordance quests can
be lucrative for low levels.

Cash dropping off mobs is a strong contender, but as you level up, you find that
mobs stop carrying proportional pocket change.  Top cash cows would be the Hill
Giants of Rathe Mountains, averaging around 15pp each... and thats about it.
You can kill decent cash farming amounts of these in your 40s... and still come
back to kill them at 60 because the cash is still better than anywhere else.  At
any rate, my point is, cash drops aren't responsible for more of the cash in the
game because mobs don't scale up as you level, and more and more of the killing
in the game is being done by high level PCs.

Biggest source of pp then, IMO, is "vendor loot".  This is the dirty secret of
norrath; mobs drop "trash" that noone wants, and if you collect that trash and
sell it to a vendor, you get pretty nice paydays.  I'm a big proponent of
"master loot", but here's where it breaks down a bit.  Master looter often gets
to keep all that trash for himself, because noone wants to bother.  I've done it
myself.  Every intention of selling and splitting out, but everyone has already
disbanded while I'm attending to that chore, as often as not.  Whats a cleric to
do?  Pocket the 500pp and go on with my life, thats what.

If you destroy all the words, pages, FS, so on and so forth, you are often
throwing away the lion's share of the value of your work.  Even if you do that,
though, the remaining "vendor" gems, fancy but worthless "vendor" weapons and so
forth still represent better money than the cash on most higher end mobs.

Here's another thing.  I'd say the majority of cash in the game comes not from
the casual players who go out, kill stuff, and split up the cash at days end,
but from dedicated PP farmers, who make a point of going after mobs that drop PP
(hill giants) or valuables (FM giant fort, NG at Seb, et al) and collect
everything and sell it all with Cha gear at 106 and a knowledge of where an easy
to get to vendor that buys at good prices is.
