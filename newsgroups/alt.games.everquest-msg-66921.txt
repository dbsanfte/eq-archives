Not that I can tell.   Druids over level 24 have no reason to buy it at all.
Ensnare casts a hell of a lot quicker and lasts a hell of a lot longer.

Weeds lasts only a minute...2 minutes shorter than snare and most battles
it's a bitch getting a ranger to snare even if there's no druid around to do
it RIGHT so count on a lot of runners if he doesn't even bother casting
Snare instead of Weeds.
