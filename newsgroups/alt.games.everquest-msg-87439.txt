First off, ATI does not suck, they make good cards with many useful
functions for work and play.  Second off, EQ is the only game I've ever had
trouble with, and only the boats, since I bought my first ATI 3D Xpression+
back in the old 486 days.  I have tried many other cards in the time between
then and now, and keep going back to the feature rich ATI cards.
Secondly, what kind of card are you running that's so wonderful?  ATI was on
top with the Radeon 8500, and unless you've spent around $500 bucks on a
card in the last month, I would be really quiet right about now.

The first step towards failure is to try.  Therefore if someone has never
failed, they have never tried.
