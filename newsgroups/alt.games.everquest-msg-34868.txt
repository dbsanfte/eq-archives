Judging by personal experience, you're wrong.  I can't tell you how
many times I tried to get Muaddib and his similarly-named relatives
changed.  Same thing for Poll Atreides and several others.  And I got
absolutely nowhere.

There was one guy, I occasionally petitioned his name from Level 20 or
so (when I first saw him) all the way up to Level 50+, and then from
Level 1 when he restarted his character a while later.  No joy.
