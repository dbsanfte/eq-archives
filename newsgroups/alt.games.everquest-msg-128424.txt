I was a guide when Luclin went live (I ain't a guide no more). We were
*discouraged* from pulling folks out of these pools, because "it is possible
to get out on your own". My guide was a gnome character, and I could get out
only if I looked straight up sans lev and swam at a side.

This is how you get out in the Shadowhaven pool too- swim to the TALL sides
not the causeway- to get out. If you fall of the bridge to Paludial, there's
a tunnel to swim through straight down in the bottom- that leads to Echo.
