I had the same problem in Swamp of No Hope (got crashes to desktop in 
FV, GD, DL too). Every time i tried to get my monk on i crached to 
desktop. Had to let a friend log into my account to get him out (wonder 
if i can be banned for letting a friend log in once to solve a problem 
like this, any ideas?)

My problem was that my Gforce Card and the DirextX version in Win ME 
didnt mix with EQ. A update to DirectX 8.1 solved the problem, so i 
could go in and get my skipping stone. So try to update to DX 8.1
