FWIW, I've gone on a couple of Fear raids not and frankly, resist gear
doesn't seem to be that big a deal.  The majority of the mobs there
are melee types, except for those damned Tentacle Tormentors and
Thought Bleeders that have a vicious AE dispell magic spell, so just
max out your AC if you're a melee character.

That said, I have also never taken down Cazic or one of the demi-gods
yet.  Was in a raid that tried to take down Fright once, but things
ended VERY badly.  Resist gear for those mobs might be different.
