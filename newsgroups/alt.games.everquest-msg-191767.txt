When me and my girlf were leveling our rogue/ranger, we tried PoD at the
castle.  Even with a 65 chanter bot (charming one of the bugs, as a
permanent hasted pet) the exp was absolute ass.

That was the night I finally got off my ass and we did the PoV trials (well
of course, the acct was only PoP enabled a few days b4).. but the difference
was absolutely massive.

Dont beat me :(
