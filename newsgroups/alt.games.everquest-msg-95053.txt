Explosive decompression is much worse than that...

First, either you EXhale ALL the air in your lungs before exposure to hard
vacuum, OR the pressure differential causes your body to expand like a
balloon and pop.

Then, assuming you survive that, your blood and other vital fluids (vitreous
humor in the eyeball comes to mind) begins to boil out of your skin (think
of it as a hickey over your entire body).

After that, your dessicated and possibly exploded corpse might get a little
bit irradiated by the hard radiation.

I've seen this happen to a lab animal once.. nasty. (one of those wierd
'educational' videos...)

Or if you don't feel like watching something real die, Event Horizon, while
not a great movie, does have a few scenes that realistically show the
effects of hard vacuum on a human.

Essentially the way to maximize survival time in hard vacuum is to first
exhale all air, then keep your eyes as closed as you can, and get the fuck
out of the vacuum ASAP.
