Yes you should. The original game is pretty cheap now, no reason not to
really if you are thinking of getting started. Actually its required.

You could concievably do that if someone was willing to post it somewhere
but its not going to do you much good since you need an account. An account
can only be created using the CD key that comes with the game when you buy
it.

Having said all that, the short answer is fess up with the small amount of
money needed to buy it from a store, create an account (Credit card required
pretty much. There is a pre-paid thing around but AFAIK the pre-paid card is
only available in the US)

We really need an FAQ for the group.
