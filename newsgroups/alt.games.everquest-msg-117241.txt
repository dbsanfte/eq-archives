While this may be true in general, I suspect it isn't true for Valien.  I 
know the guild he joined with his monk, and know that they do have a lot 
of fun, the do raid a fair amount, and they are nice and honorable people.  
They may not be the most uber guild on Innoruuk, but they're good and 
skillful players, and if he feels that the game isn't fun post-50, so be 
it.
I personally have found the game to be both much more enjoyable and much 
more frustrating 55+.  Once I made 60 the frustrations pretty much went 
away, other than guild stuff.  I love my guild, but being an officer 
certainly changes how you plat.  I've even had to learn to 2-box, not an 
easy task as a raid-leading, pulling, trash-talking bard.
