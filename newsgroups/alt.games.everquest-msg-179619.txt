Tradeskills are addictive, and apparently you're one of the .0001% not 
affected.  Still, I agree with the point about the trophies.  I'd rather 
have something useful for even a tiny bit of extra damage (ie 
nightmarewood bow, not that I lust daily after it or anything...).

AGE is weird that way.  Once in a very odd while it'll get so noisy I'll 
have to turn it off just so I can keep group chat in view.

So the shaman was telling the truth, then, when he said that if a ranger 
pulled with snare and flame lick, not even a god could pull aggro off 
him?  I kept my mouth shut, but I had a seriously hard time believing 
that.

Maybe it's just rogues :p

Sorry for my impatience, mister won't-stop-hitting-to-pickpocket :)  I 
deal with melees who will move to be on the *same goddamn side as I am*, 
melees who run up ahead of me and engage the mob way out in the middle 
of the field where the threat of adds is pretty much guaranteed - when I 
pull, a tank can stand right where he is, facing the group, and I can 
position the thing instantly.  2 seconds to let him gain aggro over an 
arrow hit, and the mob thoughtfully turns it's back to me.  If the tank 
has moved to be on the same side as me, then yes, it doesn't take *too* 
much time to move, but the ones that run out and engage before I've even 
gotten back annoy the hell out of me.  I run back, turn around, and find 
out I've got to go half the distance I just ran just to start 
backstabbing.  Add to that the fact that, fighting in DSP or OT lately, 
I'm usually on a hill, and hills have this really clever attribute of 
sending you flailing to the very bottom if you take so much as one step 
downward, and you get a pissed off rogue ;p  And I fought with a ranger 
the other day who *never* pulled to the same spot twice.  I find it 
awkward to move in any of the third person views, so I ended up having 
to constantly turn left and right to see whether he'd gotten back with a 
pull yet or not.  My pulling method = easier and better.  :p

Uh huh.  And when will you be transferring said mage to EMarr, then?

Ditto.  Have you tried a necro?  With the resources you have for 
twinking, I seriously doubt you'd experience a lot of downtime ;p

Plus, this time you couldn't make us all scream by choosing halfling.

Alright, so once again, you have resources I don't.  :p

It made enough of a difference (keeping in mind I'm still fairly heavily 
twinked for my level) that I could pull twice in a row, instead of 
bandaging up and sitting on my ass until I got to 70% or so.

I know.  The idiot picked the first one up after he disarmed it, leading 
to me yelling at him :)

Okay.  I used disarm when soloing spires once (yay aego) and it seemed 
to make enough of a difference between dying and not dying when I 
managed to disarm.  But seeing as I never parsed, I won't bring it up :p

Now I'm confused.  Are you saying I *was* cute when I played a male DE 
rogue? ::eyes you::  Besides, she's a barbarian in name only.  The mask 
only stays off if there's a perv in the group, or certain stupid 
frogloks appear out of nowhere and kick my ass one night.  I've got my 
erud mask too, but ugh.  What a horrible look.  I may just sell it again 
and save up for iksar.

You're going to have to explain to the little noob - I assume making him 
turn means literally, turning him around.  What's that have to do with 
other people?
