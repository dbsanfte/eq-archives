   I read Tweety's rants.  At the time, I was working a CS job.  Most of what
she wrote rang true to me.  But one thing... being a CSR is one of the crappiest
jobs there is.  CS reps wish they had jobs as city morgue corpse washers.  What
kind of moron does a CS job for practically free (minus the cost of a
subscription)?

    Sorry to all guides that might read this and get offended.  But really...
why are you doing it?  And can anyone explain to me why Tweety was doing it when
she obviously hated it?
