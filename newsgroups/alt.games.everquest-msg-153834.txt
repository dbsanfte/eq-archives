No I didn't, I was talking just about healing capability.

Of course central to the "nerf the monk" movement
is the fact that in addition to taking less damage, they
do more damage... mob that hits a warrior for
two minutes while doing 500 hp a minute only
hits the monk for one minute, doing 250 hp
a minute... haste shortens the damage production
time the mob has, so it makes healing even
easier.

Monk/Bard works pretty well too, for much the same reasons;
slow mob, haste monk, heal during fight... its more flexible
in some ways, with the added versatility of the bard, but
bard healing output is even worse than a shamans on a burst
level, amounting really to just very good regen.
