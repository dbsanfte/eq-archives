Yeah, I don't really understand that either ;) For me its geforce or
nvidia all the way because basically they've won. They are now the
most standard graphic chip and the most often upgraded one by the
maker. They are pretty much the industry benchmark and first you saw
3dfx fall by the way and next I think you'll see ATI go down. Kyro is
a bit more like nvidia and only makes the chip which vendors put on
their own cards but for the money Id go for a geforce 2 64 and have
the total standard instead.

Actually I don't think the geforce 2 does, the similar tech is called
"umbra" and I'm pretty sure only the geforce 3 has it. Umbra is like
what the kyro 2 does in so far as the polygons are not be rendered for
say a building and stuff when another building is blocking your view
of that building.

Yep, I really see the kryo ( i keep wanting to spell "kyro".. ahah )
as a cheap "get you by" for something it might really take advantage
of before you get a geforce 3 or an nforce or something. Even in that
case though I'd feel better getting a geforce 2 64 which I could then
use on a second computer sort of when I do get a new mb, proc, case
and geforce 3.
