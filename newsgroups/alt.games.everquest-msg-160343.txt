Sometimes it can port you even if you don't have the expansion.  When this
happens you have to get a GM to move your character and this can take a
while if there is no GM available.  Once you have the expansion it is only
supposed to port you if you are holding a shard and standing within the
spires, but sometimes you can be ported without a shard.  So, it is good
advice never to stand within the spires unless you want to be ported.  Also,
you can get ported from the nexus pads just by standing near them when they
go off.
