While swimming off the coast of BBM (with Dead Man Floating on me) I somehow
sank below the water and ended up below the world (I could see the bottom of
the ocean above me).  unfortunately I couldn't get back up to it and was
trapped.

I wandered around a bit and found myself in a world of clouds (and took a
screen shot).

I gated out before my DMF failed and dropped me to an uncertain fate.


-Well, God was my co-pilot....but we crashed into a mountain and I had to eat
Him.
