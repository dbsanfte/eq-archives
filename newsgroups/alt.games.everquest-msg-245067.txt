At the time, I was around the same level, of course, I did have SoW at 
least.  What I did was hop on the boat, and hop off shortly before it 
zoned.  In order to do that, I rode it once, doing /loc as it neared the 
zone, to find about what loc it zones at, then, rode it again, and hopped 
off near the zone.  One charge of the rod was all that was needed.  I 
still have that rod in the bank with one charge left on it, used up the 
second one, finding my corpse in OT where I had a interesting time with 
the skeletons on the dock.
