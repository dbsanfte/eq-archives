Still, DAoC is a good thing for EQ players.  It gives Verant a broader
perspective and new ideas that they may not have entertained, due to "The
Vision."  It also allows VI to watch and see how things go with Dark Ages.
I think DAoC showed them how stupid the trivial loot code was.  Hopefully
they don't get any dumb ideas from the decaying weapons.  OTOH, DAoC's
method of working the tradeskills is cool, as is the 10 member parties.
