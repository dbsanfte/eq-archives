If you are a halfling druid, the Acolyte's Anklet is a very nice item that you
can get about now (wearable by clerics and druids; dwarf, gnome and halfling
only.)

You can try for the Jaggedpine Staff, althought the Gnoll Hunters are pretty
rare. So far, there is no Symbol for Karana (like there is for Tunare,
Cazic-Thule and now Brell), but some day.... If you are in the Qeynos area, you
might want to start the investigator's badge series of quests; the first one is
not so good, but like the shawl quests, you need to do them in series and they
eventually become pretty nice.
