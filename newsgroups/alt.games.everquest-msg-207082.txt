Even with some thats good, enough to get by to get pp to get more spells,
etc.

Thats pretty cool, at least they arent giving out stuff they believe you
can quest at that level =)

I really wish they would make begging work.

As a side question, what class is in need there.  Im guessing the
breakdown of class population is something along the lines of:

1) Monk
2) Wizard
3) Druid
4) Necromancer
5) Shadowknight
6) Beastlord
7) Magician
8) Paladin
9) Ranger
10) Shaman
11) Enchanter
12) Rogue
13) Warrior
14) Cleric
and WAAAAAAY down on the list
15) Bard
