All the time on raids, or anytime I group with most 65 enchanters.  It's 
really only 4 more points of regen than KEI (Well, OK, that is almost 30% 
more), and duration is just over half that of KEI.  There is also an in 
between one, Tranquility, which is 2 points more than KEI.

KEI is 14, Tranq 16, and VoQ 18.

Guess I'm just a bit jaded.

Thinking back, I remember the first time I had a KEI cast on me.  Was on 
a guild raid in Grieg's End, just crawling the place to see the sights, 
when some uber guild trained us, and wiped most if not all of us.  They 
rezzed us, KEIed us all, and went on their way.  Wow, I was so amazed at 
what KEI did for me at the time.
