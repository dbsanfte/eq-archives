I'd like to see mobs stop spawning near players (except when there's a good
story reason).  When players sit at a camp, the only mobs they should get
are roamer.  If there is a mob that is normally in the room you are camping,
the server should see that there are people in the room, and spawn the mob
somewhere else, and send it to the room.

To make it more exciting for the campers, when this happens, there should be
a small chance that the mob will be spawned aware that its room is occupied,
so it may bring help when it comes.
