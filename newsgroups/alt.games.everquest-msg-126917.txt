Yeah, most visitors to Test probably don't realize that there is 
no player economy on Test, thus no reason for high levels to loiter 
around GFay and EC and so forth, like they do on prod servers.

Happily, I've seen very little begging or other aberrant behavior
from our guests on Test. Most of those I've talked to are quick
to point out that they have level 60 this and level 59 that on
such-and-such server, heh.
