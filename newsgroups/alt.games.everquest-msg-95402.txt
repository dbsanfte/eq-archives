Kunark port goes to Dreadlands.  Only go there if you are high enough to
fight there.  I'm 33 and I don't like to go in there.  The portal will put
you on the other side of the zone from FV and you gotta go past some nasty
spiders to get in FV.

If you are a good race, I recommend going to Faydwer and catching a shuttle
from Butcherblock to the boat to FV.  That's how I do it.  Much less corpse
runs from that. Evil races have a different way to get there, not sure of
way cuz I only play good races.

Good Luck
