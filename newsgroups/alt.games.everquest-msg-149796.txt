I love the recently added ability to send links to item descriptions.
Makes
splitting up loot much easier, makes crowing about your phat scores
more fun.  I also see it used a lot in auction and the auctions
channel...
and here's where it breaks down the most.

Links are screwed up for me, and for at least several people I've
talked to and quite a few who have been annoyed enough to complain
in /occ.

After reading in this newsgroup and doing some testing today, I've
figured out what link use is giving me trouble.  There are three ways
to post a link:

link
link (text)
(text) link
(text) link (text)

The first two ways work fine, but the second two fail almost every time.

I see
(text) 097098itemname
or
(text) 8543itemname (text)

and the number+itemname combinations are either not clickable or
pull up some other item.

The practice of saying
/auction WTS ubergear
turns up garbage every time, while simply saying
/auction ubergear
works great, as does
/auction ubergear WTT for ubermonkgear

I'm using the default new UI, and have no idea why this is happening
to me and not for at least some others.  I do know, as I've said, that
at least part of the EQ population is getting the same garbage.

If anyone has a fix for this, I'd love to see it.

In the meantime, I suggest that if you actually want to reach the
largest
possible target audience with your links, that you change your posting
style to one where one link appears per line, and the link appears at
the start of the line with no text preceding it (type of line command
is fine, /tell, /auction, /say, /g, /gu, /1... whatever)

I'd like to get some kind of statistic as to what portion of the players

are having this trouble, if its 10% I can't see getting people to change

their style, but if its 50% it seems to me anyone not changing is a
fool.
