I did this quest when I was about your age.  You cannot Harmony for the top
of the well.  You go down the ramp and inch your way to the edge until you
get within casting range of the citizens (extended camera view helps target
them).  I Harmonied each one to be sure and pulled one at a time.  It took a
few kills before I got the flesh.  Guards will not attack the citizens so do
not train them topside.
