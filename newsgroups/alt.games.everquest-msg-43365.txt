Greetings

For the last 3 days I have been getting the 1017 error message constantly. I
have not added or changed anything on my system but are still unable to play
Everquest.
I have a Intel P3 733, 256MB Ram, Direct X 8.0 (4.08.00.0400), Windows 98 SE
(4.10, build 2222) and the latest Nvidia graphics drivers for my Riva TNT 2
video card.

I have followed the instructions in your Tech Help forum and have added
eqinfo.txt and dbg.txt files for you to look at in the hope you can clear my
problem.

Regards
Dave Roberts.
