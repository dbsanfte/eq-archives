Not that I give the EULA any weight whatsoever, and this is one of the very
reasons that I feel I give the proper weight to the EULA.

I might have agreed to the EULA when I installed the game.  I honestly don't
remember, but will stipulate such for the sake of argument.  I most
definitely didn't agree to the current EULA.  I could dig around and find my
original CDs (maybe) and see what it is that I actually agreed to in order
to install the software, but since I'm too lazy to do so, and I'd imagine so
are most other people, you'd have to do a helluva lot of work to actually
support your contention, even assuming, arguendo, that the EULA had the
force of law.
