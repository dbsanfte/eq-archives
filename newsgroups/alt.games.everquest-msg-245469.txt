With true shot its about 600 dps using a top end bow. Without ts its about
300 dps. 300 Dps is more dammage than a monk for instance puts out (they
usually log about 250). It is comparable dammage to a rogue.

Ensnare is a ridiculously usefull spell, tracking is a ridiculously usefull
skill , foraging is nice if you are a tradeskiller.I think rangers are
probably 5th or 6th overall. I will take a ranger over a rogue, the only dps
class i prefer more is a beastlord.
