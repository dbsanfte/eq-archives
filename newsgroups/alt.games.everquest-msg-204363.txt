Sorry, not up on the alternatives for melee's in other slots -
although, since you melee, you might consider replacing the
face, neck and (non-solstice) ear with stuff with more AC.  
Also, since you'd be losing wis on those, replace the bracelet
of might with a bracelet of comprehension (+15 wis instead
of +15 str all other stats the same).  Additionally, is the
+4% to dodge in the range actually better than something with
more ac/hp?
