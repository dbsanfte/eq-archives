Now, now. You're only saying that because it was a nightmare to navigate
mildly complex dungeons. It was perfectly adequate in those cases where
the entire dungeon was on the same plane.

Of course, a regular automap would have been as useful.

(I think when I stopped playing Daggerfall my character was stuck in an
enormous dungeon where finding the way out seemed to be impossible, map
or no map.)

Daggerfall added new meaning to "a maze of twisty little passages,
all alike." The map was one of the better 3D maps I've seen, but it still
wasn't particularly good.
