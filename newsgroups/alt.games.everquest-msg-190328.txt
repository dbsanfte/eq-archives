That sounds a little complicated to me.  I think Sony should buy a
small amount of plat from each of the big plat sellers & then put some
type of transfer log on those characters.  They should continue to log
backwards until they find the true source of all that plat.

I'm sure that the big sellers use many mule type accounts, but Sony
could determine the source of all that plat  if they felt it was a
threat to the EQ economy & the future success of their game.
