Boy what would you think growing up in EQ 3 years ago BEFORE kei and voq
even was thought of or to be had but such noobiness.

I grew up in those days, I remember EC tunnel there was no temperance or kei
or even MGB (pre-game back on track for some i.e. nerf) you delt with what
you had and it makes quality players. no powerleveling, no boxing (well
atleast not as much).geez nowadays you get player that can't even kill
struggle cream with out having virtue/kei/or symbols/bo9/kei/bss , try
playing with what only you have go out make an alt and do NOT twink it do
not ask for buffs, try it that way that is the game I played.

well I guess my rant is done.
sorry if i bothered anyone
