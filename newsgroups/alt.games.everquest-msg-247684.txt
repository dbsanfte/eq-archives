Yes it was right thing to do. Screw the rest of 'em. They'd have done 
the same thing in your shoes and I don't care what they say in here. If 
they were camping a mob in game for something they wanted and someone 
came in and stole it from them they wouldn't be nodding sagely and 
saying, "Good one on them!" They'd be pissing and moaning about KSers 
and how they were only afk for 2 seconds to pick the baby up out of the 
fire or something equally lame.(1)

(1) Not that picking up a baby out of the fire is lame. I just mean to 
say that it'd be a stupid excuse so ppl wouldn't say "You shouldn't have 
left the keyboard ya idiot! Didn't you have your computer set to 
alarm(2) at the spawn time like the rest of us for our camps? Geez 
n00b." You get the idea.

(2) No. I've never, EVER timed a spawn. Not once in 5 years. I'm not 
that much of a goon.(3)

(3) not that all ppl who time spawns are goons.
