My motivation for question #2 is as follows: i have 5 rewards
available, i have divied up 3, and have 2 left over. Do i give to an
existing char? If I use them all up, I can't assign to a newly rolled
toon.

Regarding the no reward ever cycled..I see the veterans rewards as
"account-based"  (based on how long u have had the account) rewards
rather than "toon base rewards" (i.e. reward cuz your char accomplished
something). I understand that the toons never get deleted, but by
binding the reward to a toon, the benefit moves from account based to
toon based.

I dont lose more than 3 or 4 hours of sleep over this ;)..so its no
biggie..just curious tho.
