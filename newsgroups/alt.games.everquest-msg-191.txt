Yeah, i was in a group that kept suffering link death, and since I'm in
australia, and they were from different coasts in america, it doesn't sound
like an isp issue. Of course, one problem all australians have is that
there's really only one ISP controlling international traffic, and the other
isps have to go through that one, so we all tend to suffer link death at the
same time.

One solution would be to put a server on this side of the globe; preferably
in australia, but i suspect there may be too few aussies to justify it...
although there must be quite a few asian players, surely? If not now, then
certainly potentially.

Anyone know how many players around this side of the globe there are? Enough
to justify a server located locally?
