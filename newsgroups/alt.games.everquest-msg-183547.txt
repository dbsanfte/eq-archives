I placed my bets on how soon we'd see a level 65 frog.  I guessed two 
days, and as ... I think it was Tarre on Xev? ... said there was one at 
39 only partway through the first day, I'd like to think I won the bet.

Only, of course, I forgot to convince anybody to actually put money on 
it.  Shoot.
