Who created Satan?

Or, perhaps a better question is, why does God allow Satan to exist?

Wouldn't more people be "saved" if Satan didn't exist to tempt people?

According to the Christian Bible, Satan is a fallen angel.  How did
that happen when angels were supposed to be perfect?

Did God create Satan (in a round-about sort of way) on purpose?

Last but not least, if God is perfect, isn't it within his power to
find a solution whereby ALL people are saved AND have free will at
the same time?

Religion: it just doesn't make any sense.  And thus, any arguments
built upon religious principles also don't make any sense.
