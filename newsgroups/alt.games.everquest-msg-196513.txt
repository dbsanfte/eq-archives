Even before KEI I can remember people "/OOC twinked warrior LFG"!  So you have
a good point here.  Maybe they should make a "weapon and armor shack" where the
level one through level twenty players can go outfit themselves with centi
longswords, fungi tunics, etc.,  that are "no drop / no rent".  
Oh my, I bet SOE never thought of that!  Just remember where you heard it first
:)
