My apologies Kobe.  I got an error when I orginally posted and just
assumed that it didn't take.  And then I compounded that error later
by not checking.  Thanks for saying something.  I probably would not
have been smart enought to check on my own.

I would like to thank all the people who replied to my original post. 
The info was valuable to me.  Good Huning.
