Actually, they can stay underwater exactly as long as anybody else with
the same Stamina as theirs.  Swim skill doesn't affect "time to
drowning". That one's been tested pretty extensively and reported on
here. Swim skill only affects the speed you swim at and, apparently,
slightly enhanced navigation (steering, going backwards a tad) skills in
the water. Stamina is apparently the only factor that affects how long
you can hold your breath.
