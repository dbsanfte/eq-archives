As a shaman, my usual plan was to stand toe  to toe with the slowed mob 
and let him pound on me while I kept myself healed and let the pet kill 
him for me.  At low levels I'd melee as well, eventually that became 
silly and I'd just stand there on my drogmar getting meditation mana, 
yawning occaisionally in his face just for fun.  Point being to get the 
pet in the back where its damage output was better, and have the mob 
hitting me so the pet didn't lose any of his DPS to stuns.

Of course that plan also didn't have me getting any mana from sitting down.
