There is no other crime.  There can be no legitimate law against hating
someone.  There is a law against killing someone, however.  All you're doing
is prosecuting the motive.  Considering that all cases of first degree
murder have motives, how can we say that one is "worse" than another?

If you can declare a "hate crime," then we're not handing out stiff enough
sentences to begin with.
