It's not enough aggro to worry about once the tank has actually
engaged but it will generate aggro if you cast it too early.  A
mob that's been pulled, for instance, will make a beeline for
the mage/druid instead of the KoS tank if it's cast too early.

I've never seen an *engaged* mob come off a tank for any buff
except for Heroic Bond myself and I figured after that time
I'd make sure to wait until after the tank actually got ALL the
way back from the pull and started tanking to cast it, full mana
or no, whiny enchanter or no.  ;)
