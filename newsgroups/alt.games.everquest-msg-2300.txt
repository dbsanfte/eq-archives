Lodizal shell shield, ac23 str+10 wis+10 cha+5 agi-5 magic+10 cold/fire+20,
effect: Enduring breath. Worn on secondary melee or back slot.

You will NEVER see one for sale. Ever. There is no item in the game with
such a broad-based appeal and raw uberness. For all races/classes who *can*
use this, there really isn't any chance of finding anything better.
