H(eroic) O(pportunity)

Short version:  every class can trigger them by a special skill/spell.
They can then complete them by casting/using required spells/skills
(shown by both icon and flashing "spell gems").   Competing them
gives extra damage or other benefits.

For example:  a newbie priest (after he gets the trigger ability)
can use his own -- that equates to Trigger, Nuke, Nuke.  It
gives extra damage *power free* roughly about a nuke and
a half.   Same idea for other classes although the things involved
and reward will be different.

Same thing for a group -- except then it will involve the group
members acting with teamwork to complete one.  The HO
would require completion by multiple players.

Any break in the chain -- ie, if it asks for a nuke, you can't
debuff, etc -- means the HO is lost.   In groups, if it wants
a mage nuke, any other player can't use their special attacks.

Scout classes can change the HO and steer it to better rewards.
IOW, the HO being completed may result in extra damage.
They can use their ability to change it to one which results in
group-wide HP and power-regen.

It's VERY useful when soloing.  And VERY hard-to-do in
groups, at least at lower levels when fights are slow and
people tend to do thier own thing more...
