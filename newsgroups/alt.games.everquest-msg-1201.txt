Ok guys since I installed winme my eq experience has crapped out.  My
framerate sux when I'm in a group and start fighting.  I had no problem with
win98 doing this.
 I have an 800mhz and 128megs ram and a voodoo 3000 card.  Has anyone else
noticed this or could it just be dew to server over-crowding?
