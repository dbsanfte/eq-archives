    My guess would be it was coded in to protect folks on the boat from
being attacked when they couldn't defend themselves. If you don't move, the
boat makes you invis - indifferent to things in the zone. So you won't be
attacked. I wonder if it's actually Hide that happens - I suppose one could
go to Erud's, target a zombie sailor, verify they CAN see through regular
Invis, then get on the boat and see if the /con changes.
