This is how I rolled up my last few alts. Its a lot of fun. They're 56 
with 70+ AAs now (lots of AAs because there is no point in power 
leveling past the gear they are wearing... and the AAs really help 
compensate for the weaker gear allowing them to survive harder content.

They still run temp and c2 (i run a cleric 2nd, and i have like minded 
friend who runs an enc). I've had KEI maybe 5 times total (I'm not going 
to go out of my way to avoid an MGB...) Gearing up has been a blast ...I 
had completed the SolRo armour for the SK minus one bracer (and had most 
of the cleric peices too) My SK recently got a soulscream belt from 
Veksar upgrading from the haste belt he got in The Deep... Picked up a 
bunch of upgrades from the 5th anniversary 1-groupable fabled (did 
Nurgan named, Drelzna, the Drake in Skyfire, Eldak, and many more).

Anyhow...at this point I'm not really interested in starting up all over 
on a new server to do what I'm already doing. But if you happen to pick 
the server I'm on I'd be happy group and/or guild with more like minded 
people once you've caught up a bit in levels. 

No rush though... that's the whole point :)
