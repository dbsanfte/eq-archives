 From my Smithing (1 char) and Fletching (6 chars) experience that's
about right.  Seem to get 70% to 80% success when at or just above
trivial (with an occasional bad run to drag the average down a bit
from that), up to 95% when it's actually *way* trivial, which to me
always seemd to be around 30 or so past trivial (which agrees with
the formula you gave).  For example, to Fletch the 150 range arrows
that trivial at 56 skill my characters push Fletching into the high
80s to get the 95% success rate (95% seems to be the max unless it's
a "no fail" combine).  Hmm, come to think of it success vs. trivial
worked out around that for Baking too.
