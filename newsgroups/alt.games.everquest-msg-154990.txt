I dunno about e-mail, but I've /feedback'd some stuff that's been
changed.  I'm not claiming I'm solely responsible of course, I'm sure
many others thought of the same thing, but still, it proves they read
suggestions.  Most recently I sent in a note BEGGING them to
alphabetize the trader list in Bazaar.  Next patch, boom, alphabetized
trader list. /pet Verant
