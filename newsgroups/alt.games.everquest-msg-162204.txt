It might have hurt the "spend 4 hours a day porting for plat" type of 
druid, but for me as a druid that dont go anon, and never auctions to 
port people, the request for ports have gone UP.
Of course it also depend on WHERE you are. For some reason, GFay are 
always goot for a port, although it got 1 (or 2, not sure) books, and a 
spire. Everywhere not near a city are good too, if you really wanna port 
for plat, head to somewhere like Sebilis.


I wish someone would explain to people that druid never get ports any 
more, so i could get some peace.
