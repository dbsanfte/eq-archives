Velious completely trivializes the enchanters ability to mez .  On the
bright side mezzing was never necessary in the first place . No matter the
zone sufficiently skilled or crafty groups can manage to pull solo mobs . In
other words the pair of monks get to play again in velious and enchanters
become buffers . Buffing is very boring so the chanter population falls
again at the upper end. I know I get begged to play the chanter all the time
instead of one of my other characters .
