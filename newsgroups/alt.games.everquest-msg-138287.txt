The exact cause of the fall was not immediately obvious from your first
post.  You should always petition, can't hurt.  Give it a few minutes, if
you don't get an answer, then get a rez, and move on.  That death was
marginal certainly, you would not have died if you had not been so heavily
burdened, and you certainly should know that it is possible to take some
falling damage when porting somewhere.  Still, it can't hurt to try.  I've
gotten one or two CS Rezzes in circumstances that could easily have been
argued to be my fault.
