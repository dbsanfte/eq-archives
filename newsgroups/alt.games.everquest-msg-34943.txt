Downtime yes, but you're killing four mobs at once! =)

The wonderful thing about quad-kiting is that, except a few extra casts of
Ensnare, it takes just as much mana to kill 2 mobs using AE as it does to
kill 4. Imagine if AE's could hit more than 4 mobs at once! Kiting eight
wyverns at once (though extremely dangerous if they ever got into melee
range) would give you a LOAD of exp all at once, and a nice chunk of cash.

Anyway, let's do some math .. Using made-up numbers, and considering no
resists, but you'll get the idea.

Let's say you've got three spells: a DD, a DoT, and an AE ..
 - DD does 500 damage for 200 mana
 - DoT does 750 damage for 200 mana
 - AE does 300 damage for 200 mana

1) If you kited a mob that had 5000 hps, using only the DD, it would take 10
casts or 2000 mana to kill it.
2) If you root/dotted that mob, using only the DoT, (let's say the root does
zero damage) it would take (at best, if root doesn't break at all) 7 casts
or 1400 mana to kill it.
3) If you pulled four of the said mob, and only used the AE spell to kill
them, you would have to cast it 17 times (or 3400 mana) to kill them all.

Roughly, it would take a little less than two times as much mana to
quad-kite as it would to single-kite, and a bit over double as much mana
than root/dot'ing.

You'll be left with a very empty mana pool, but you will have killed four
mobs instead of one.

Case in point .. It takes me approximately two bubbles to root/dot a Hill
Giant using ES Vambs/Winged Death/Breath of Ro/2nd cast of ES Vambs .. It
takes me about three bubbles to quad-kite Hill Giants using the level 49 AE.
I'd rather use up that extra bubble of mana to take out four than use two
thirds as much to take out one.

It's not easy to do at earlier levels, but once you can do it, it's very
worth it. I'm working on getting a few levels so I can get Fist of Karana ..
Ultra-nice AE spell. Quad-kiting suits of Sentient Armor in WL will replace
sitting in Sebilis for an hour finding a group, then having to leave when
the cleric has to go or some such annoyance. =)
