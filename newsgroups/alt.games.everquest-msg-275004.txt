Sounds like how EQ players have been "enjoying relatively tuned content" for
years.  =)

Your post actually makes me think I may have underestimated the impact it
may eventually have, because it does suggest they have taken the cues from
EQ on raid encounters for the most part (no huge surprise, but at the same
time it doesn't sound like EQ2 even did that, which is somewhat of a
surprise).

It is amusing that Conquest pops up in this scenario though.  =)
