The skill may not be nerfed what may have happened is that the success rate
may have been altered so that you have to move to a higher level to enjoy
the success you have been having previously.  This could be done by simply
setting the success versus skill level higher.  I have noticed in the past
when these things have happened with other skills they tend to correct
themselves in a few levels.  So I think this may be what is going on here.
