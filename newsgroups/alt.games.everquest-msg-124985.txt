I played EQ on and off with an SBLive for a few years.  Never quite
happy with the performance...sound never quite worked right.

I recently purchased the TurtleBeach Santa Cruz.

Much better experience...no weird sudden "screetch" sound thru the
speakers and the game actually seems to play a bit smoother during
combat (I used to get jerky pauses...no more).

Some people get luckier than others.  Not sure how to pinpoint the
problem...sometimes I'll rebuild my PC- reinstall Everquest and
everything is fine...the next time...problems return.

But in my experience- the SantaCruz has been a better card for me. 

My Setup:
P3800
512Ram
SantaCruz
XP-Pro
