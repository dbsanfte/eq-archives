*shrug* ok, a correction.

CC sucks for a mage soloing after 40, compared to Dalnir.  While possible,
it'd take you longer in CC due to the lack of spawns, compared to Dalnir.

Keep in mind that the guy is a mage.  He has no crowd control abilities and
no way to split pull.

A clarification:
Thurgadin is more convenient than Firiona Vie, and there are probably closer
vendors than that to CC.
