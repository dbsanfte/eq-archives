I suppose I should have taken the time before to do this, but here is
a link to the thread from last week where I told Ben Sisson about the
upcoming free trial in response to his post:

http://groups.google.com/groups?q=g:thl2852972243d&dq=&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&selm=sfcaa095cls15ognnmje2l4digqf2tvj5k%404ax.com

Or http://tinyurl.com/2msnz if it wraps.

It was not at all my intention to spam. Sorry you took offense.
