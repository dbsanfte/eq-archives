Not sure, I have tanked in the PoP zones (on single group mobs) as a rogue.
I have grouped here with just shaman as healers, all no real problems.
For 8 person groups use a raid put 4 people in each group and if the levels
are close to the raid average then you won't even notice any lessened xp.
You ask for something that is not really needed, you have a work around, so
why would they waste time doing something else. Plus if your group is
remotely skilled you don't need a "perfect" group (not even sure what a
perfect single group would be that would be 100% generic to handle
everything)
