I can agree that much of the feel of Norrath as a world is gone, and I
regret it.  However - I have to disagree with the part about hating
instanced dungeons.  I love them.

I enjoy interacting and playing with other people.  I find little enjoyment
by being griefed by them.  I've been trained while setting up for IV, I've
been leapfrogged for every dragon before PoP, I've had every kiting class in
existence drag quads over groups, I've had to take a raid to Solusek's Eye
to rescue a cleric who was waiting in line to do her epic turn-in there and
was being trained with fire giants by a bored ass who said he was going to
delevel her so far she wouldn't be able to do her turn-in.  (Raid was going
to do another mob, but you screw with my guildmate and I'll do what it
takes, so as raid leader I changed targets.  Shows what kind of guild we
had, nobody complained, just grabbed a druid for the port).

LDON lets me play with the cool people I want to play alongside, while
allowing me to ignore the existence of the greifers.  I can do pickup groups
and meet new friends, and if I end up with a jerk at most I'm stuck with
them for an hour - and I'm not afraid to take a fail to walk away from a
really bad player.

LDON for me is a success - I can put a thread on the guild board, have folks
sign up, and have a LDON group logging in and grouping up ten minutes after
I get home from work.  I can turn on LFG tool and get a pickup group and
maybe make a few friends, or at least have a laugh to share with the
guildies about how sorry the group I'm in is playing.  I can get groups with
every toon I have - sure, my wizard and enchanter can always get a group,
but when was the last time pre-LDON that a 25 necro got a group, never mind
being VALUED as a group member?
