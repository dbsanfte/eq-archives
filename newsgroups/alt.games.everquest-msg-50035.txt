I haven't played FV (or any game for that matter) in awhile but beggar's
shall always be here...lurking in the shadows then they jump out "YOU HAVE
SOME COPPER!?" or something like that...

Beggar: 'Why are you mad at me?'
You: 'You were begging it was annoying.'
Beggar: 'I role-play a beggar.'
You /groan

Heh
