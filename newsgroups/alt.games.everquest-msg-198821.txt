This is exactly the attitude that's the problem.  You do NOT need KEI
to fight effectively.  A group that has an enchanter that can mez and
is doing chain pulls is going to fight very well.  They'll always have
a mob mezzed, ready to kill.  If the tank is maintaining aggro the
cleric will occasionally be doing a CH on just one player.  I have
fought continuously for HOURS in such a group, without taking any
breaks.  The group was killing as fast as it could, and KEI was simply
irrelevant.

The problem with KEI is that suddenly a group feels that it is uber
and starts overpulling, ignoring mana, not paying attention to mez,
has mobs aggroed on multiple players at once, etc.  And guess what,
even with KEI the cleric will go OOM and you'll have to pause once in
a while.
