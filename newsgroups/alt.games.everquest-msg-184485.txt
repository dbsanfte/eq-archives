I would recomment upgrading your video card.  It made a huge difference for
me when I went from the NVidia M64 VC to the Geforce4 MX420 (64mb DDR).  Lag
was terrible before using Windows XP w/ 512mb RAM; once I upgraded my video
card cut the lag to almost nil (and the MX420 is  the worst of the
Geforce4's).  Just my 2 cents.
