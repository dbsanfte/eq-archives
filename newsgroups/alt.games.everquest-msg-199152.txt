Wondering if anyone would like to divulge some secrets and or tips to this
zone.  I noticed EQAtlas has it as a 30-45 zone.  I took my 43 wiz there to try
and grab some components for Twilight armor for my pally.  Everything I saw was
dark blue to me but everyone fighting in the zone was in their high 50's.  I'm
going there to try and obtain any or all of the following:
Fleshy Vine from a Fleshy Sunflower
Lexicon of the Sun from a Bloodtribe Lorekeeper
Mark of Steadfast from a Steadfast Spire Spirit
Light Etched Sapphire from a Light Cheetah
Mark of Reliance from a Violent Rockhopper
I assuming these are all probably somewhat rare although I was told I might
also be able to find them at the vendors.  Are there any vendors in this zone
and if not what vendors do you think might be most likely to have these?  Any
help or tips on this zone would be greatly appreciated.  TIA.
