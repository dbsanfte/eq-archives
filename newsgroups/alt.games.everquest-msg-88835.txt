CEB (Crypt with Blood and Emperor) I can understand, albeit a little long to
explain to people :)  but where does 4-door come from?

Bartender and Chef is on occasion seperate camps, but with a competant group
your always looking around for mobs now, I know when I do sebilis (which
isnt often anymore) it typicaly involves a dire charm chanter (love perma
charmed golems hehe), and a warr with SOD/willsapper/stuff along those
lines.. so if we take chef, there really isnt going to be anything available
for other groups to leach

Seems a bit unusual to call crypt and crypt with emporer with different
names... I think even if a group didn't pull the Emp there isn't going to be
enough to keep another group entertained, who are there to only kill Emp
Chotal

It does make me wonder where the camp names come from heh, and what makes
particular names stick whilst others never get used to again
