Well I don't know I guess they stack them. But they shouldn't be using 3 
freakin' CD-ROM's either. They should come on DVD. It's time to get rid of 
the CD-ROM, it's antique and it's the age of the DVD now.

I guess I don't really care how big the outer box is as long as the media 
comes in a decent case. I can always toss the box.

Well I've been playing D&D of some sort since I was 11 or so, which may 
explain why I don't bother reading the manuals for the PC versions. But 
there are few RPGs I've ever bothered to read the manual on. I'm trying to 
think of some... I did read the manual for Questron II way back in the day. 
Hmm... I think I read most of the Wizardry manuals. I think you pretty much 
had to because you had to type in the spell names in the earlier versions 
to cast them. Or was that Bard's Tale? And I probably read most of the 
Ultima manuals. I really think most of the manuals for these games would 
probably fit in a DVD style case though (if formatted for that size).
