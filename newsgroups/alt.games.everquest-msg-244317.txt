Funny, I followed up to the other followup before reading this, and we 
came up with the same simile. :)  I certainly didn't mean to imply that 
poisons should be used in every combat.  Well... some of the PoP poisons 
that last 15-20 minutes or so per use... maybe.  Hmm, the pages I used to 
look up stuff about pop poisons (Corinari's guide) seem to have gone poof. 
Anyone know of a new site for that info?
