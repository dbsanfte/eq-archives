Well, if you've played EQ then all these games have an easy learning
curve.  Nothing has come so tough to start with than EQ.

> Interface
don't know about AC2.  Horizons and DAoC are pretty good to my taste.

> Casual Playability
I'd say definitely Horizons.  

> Solo Playability
Horizons hands down.

> Group Playability
Dark Age of Camelot wins here of the 3.  If Everquest was considered a
'forced group' game, then Horizons is almost a 'forced solo' game.

> Questing/Quests Quality
Dark Age of Camelot.

> In-game events/story
Horizons here, from the same guys that made the original AC, Weekly
(or biweekly?) major world events like invasions, discoveries, etc. 
leading to the eventual discovery of new playable races.

> Crafting Usefulness/Fun
Horizons and DAoC here, though the best is one not in your list... SWG

> Economy in the game
DAoC (at least when I played it).  

> Beauty of gameworld
(again, don't knw about AC2)  Both are fine, but I would tend towards
DAoC.  Still, again the best is one not in the list... SWG

> Quality of Dungeons
No dungeons in Horizons, so DAoC by default.

> Lore - Depth of backstory and history, continuing story?
Related to the frequent world events, I'd say Horizons.

> Community - Good Fan sites/boards
I would say DAoC but just because it's been out longer.

> Age of game
Horizons: 2 months.  DAoC: several years
>   Population of servers
  Horizons:  good enough but it's only 2 months old, hoping it doesn't
dwindle down.
>   Population of newbies
  Horizons:  Except for those who played beta, everyone is still sort
of a newbie.

> Server Stability
  Horizons:  Very stable as in no crashes, but still many lag problems
to be resolved.  DAoC:  Very stable

> Customer Service
  dunno, never used them.
> 

So, if you like grouping, DAoC.   If you like soloing, Horizons.  If
you want a mix... DAoC.   Also, if you're willing to try it... SWG :) 
Should give you a good 3-4 months before City of Heroes or something
