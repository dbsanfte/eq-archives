Ouch, then I wager my 50 berzerk will have substantial trouble even though
I do have a fairly reliable ghetto slow (chain stun eats about 50% of a 
mobs DPS, assuming no resists)

I barely break 1000 AC with a Virtue, and my high end raid buffed HP is 
just over 4k, I'm reasonably sure that won't compete at all with a 65 
ranger.
