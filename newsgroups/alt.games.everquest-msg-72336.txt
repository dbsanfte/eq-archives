At 21 my magician spent most of his time in South Karana.  Good XP, and not
many resists.  21 is a little low for a spire group, but it can be done.
There will be plenty of blues and yellow in KFC, along with an occasional
elephant.  If you are soloing stay away from the centaurs, as their arrows
will break your concentration(found out the hard way with my druid), but if
you are in a group they won't pose a problem.   At 25 I am currently in
Rathe Mountains hunting Giant Skeletons.  I have to solo there since it is
rare that anyone else is within 10 levels of me.
