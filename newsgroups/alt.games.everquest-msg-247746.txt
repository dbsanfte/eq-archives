Skill raises and levels should be what happens as you play the game, not the
game in itself.  If you find yourself in a really good group, ask them if
you may stand back and shoot the mobs.  You're still doing damage and
working the skill at the same time.  If you're hanging around a zone looking
for a group to join, ask an established one if you can shoot their mobs.
There's zero chance you will KS them and more skill points.  If it's a
velious group, you can get faction hits at the same time.
