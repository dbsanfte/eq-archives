But if it's labour to play the game, why are you playing?  If you want
to labour at something you can certainly make more money elsewhere as
you pointed out.  So why waste the time on a game?

Games today take alot more time than in days past.  But if it's labour
then you're doing something wrong, or the game sucks. 

 And there is no legal barring of bands making money from original,
and sometimes not so original, music.  There is in regards to games
like EQ.
