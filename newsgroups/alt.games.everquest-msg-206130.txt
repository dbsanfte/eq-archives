I cant agree more if I i could find a decent lot of peeps on my server I
wouldnt mind but Im at the point i havent played for over  month and im not
sure if im going to start again I dont need to pay for someone to insult me
lol i got a wife and kids hehe. I used to love Playing after the kids went
to sleep, my wife sgtarted too but were both fed up with these new peeps and
most of the "old timers" like us have already quit. I gave away 3 of my 4
accounts to a friend. I just cant part with my necro yet though.
