That's weird. I switched from an 64 enchanter to a bard and was amazed
how little aggro mezz was generating.
As enchanter I always was prepared to get a beating when mezz was
broken. As a bard I was annoyed sometimes that I did not have such a
good aggro building tool. But most of the time I'm glad I could mezz and
don't worry about aggro.
And I did this chainmezz thing quite often. The only songs that generate
more than usual aggro are rune songs as far as I can remember. It has
been a while since I last logged on though.
