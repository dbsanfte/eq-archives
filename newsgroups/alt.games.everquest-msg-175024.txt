one thing! although you are most likely correct for your server on VS the
economy hasnt built up enough yet for an example: I had nearly a stack of
morning dew which goes for around 30-50pp on ayonae ro (may have gone down
in price a little havent checked for a long time) so i goes up expecting to
be able to slightly twink my druid and finds a few ppl selling for 5pp sets
mine grudgingly to 4pp and leaves it on overnight and not a single sale. the
other surprise upon zoning into bazaar found 40 odd traders and no lag.
