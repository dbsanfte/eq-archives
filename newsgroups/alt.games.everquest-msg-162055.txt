There's a difference between proximity agro (the mob notices that it
hates you) and chain agro (the mob notices that its buddy hates you).
Many green mobs will proximity agro (goblins are famous for this),
but few (if any) greens will chain agro.  That's why you have to
Harmony nearby blue cons when you pull the Elites, but the Centurions
are no problem unless you personally get too close.  Somebody else
posted to the thread that chain agro from those orcs stops at around
L55, so if you were working with a L55 puller that person could pull
them without Harmony.
