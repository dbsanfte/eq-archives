IIRC I never said this .. asked the question why people get flamed for
top posting look again.  I also said that if you don't like it killfile
or ignore them.

I was jumping into a thread which was about top posting.  See answer to
your first point.

The "experiment" as you termed it was based off my count over a 2 day
period in all the groups I subcribe to.  I guess this is a question of
semantics.  If TomG in the alt.comp.periphs.mainboard.abit posts over
10% of the posts (current count of 101 of 900 posts on my news server
and he is a top poster non-snipper), my newsreader XanaNews breaks down
the posting list. And others with large posting counts such as PRIVATE
1964, Amir Facade, Robert, FN, Justin Clark, Bill and I could go on
(all are top posters).  I assume you are saying that because 30% of the
posters are top posters that does not make a top posting newsgroup even
if they contribute well over 50% of the posts?

I do not remember doing this. IRRC I did say leave them alone or
killfile them do not abuse them.

IIRC This was on the "bottom poster gets caned thread not the original
thread.

No was not surprised on this with the "bottom poster gets caned" thread
.. was certainly surprised on the original thread which was the point
of my post in the first place.

I do not remember the FAQ in my time in here and it is not posted at
all, which it should be if people want to enforce it.  And certainly Mr
Sisson et al appear not to have read the bit in the FAQ about treating
others as you would want to be treated (or perhaps they have). Thanks
you for being the first to answer my question.

Again if memory serves me well that was on the "Bottom poster gets
caned" thread. When I had my dander up still.
