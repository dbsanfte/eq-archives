If you have a cleric in the main melee group (KS?) then they have one less
damage producer, but your raid still has the same # of melees so I don't see
the point of not including the cleric.  Seems to me that there should be a
cleric in every group so he can keep tabs on all melee's health bars.  I
haven't been to many raids, but for the ones I have been on it was like
that.
