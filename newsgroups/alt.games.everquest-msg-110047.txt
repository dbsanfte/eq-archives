First of all, let me say one thing: http://www.eqtraders.com/

>can anybody tell me what   < Steel Boning  > is used for ?

Boning is used to tailor reinforced armor - which is generally a waste
of time for anything other than practice when you *happen* to have
spare HQ wolf pelts. ( Cat and bear have far more valuable uses )

>how can i make  < sheet of metal > ?  (i use in a forge in quenos 1 water+2

Was it the regular forge there or the racial smithing forge? Were they
small BRICKS of ore (non-stackable) or small PIECES of ore
(Stackable)?

>how can i make rings with stat modifiers ?  ( for example STA+2 ......)

No can do with smithing. That's done with jewelcrafting. You need an
enchanted (get an enchanter) metal bar ( Silver, electrum, gold,
platinum, velium ) and a gem, combine in a jeweling kit.
