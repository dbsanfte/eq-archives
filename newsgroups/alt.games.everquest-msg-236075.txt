I'd be shocked if most people were as smart as you give them credit for.
Obviously the commercial is a gimmick, and whether you love it or hate it,
you *remember* it and you're talking about it.  That's what they were aiming
for, and they hit the mark dead on.  It's like that report about Howard
Stern's listeners in his movie.  I don't remember the quote but the gist was
the people who hated him listened even longer than the people who loved him.
All you folks complaining about the commercial are unwittingly making it
successful.  I thrive on irony.
