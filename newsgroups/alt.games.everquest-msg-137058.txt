Are you saying it did not become an issue when people rioted night
after nigh in New York, refusing to accept police oppression of the
gay community, and forcing both city officials and the media to pay
attention?

Are you saying it was not an issue when Oscar Wilde defended himself
of the charges of sexual misconduct by stating in a public trial that
his sexual orientation was neither immoral, wrong, sick, desctructive,
nor any of the other comments levelled against him by society?   Are
you saying that a person shocking a country by saying "this should not
be illegal" in a trial still famous more than a century later did not
make it an issue?

Are you saying that the writings of Karl Ulrich on same-sex
relationships in the 1860s, at a time when such writings where
considered immoral and illegal, did not make it an issue?

Are you saying it was not an issue during and after WWII when the US
military did a massive number of dishonorable discharges based on
homosexual conduct in the San Francisco area, thus in part creating
one of the largest gay communities in the US?

Your statement was, and I quote your words exactly without paraphrase
or creative re-wording:

>>The fact that open homosexuality hasn't been an issue until the last
>>20 years or so

No, do you still want to stick to that statement?   Do you want to
back off, dodge, waffle, tap-dance, or pull a Clinton?   Or maybe
<gasp> admit you are wrong.

> Do you STILL wonder why no one wants to provide proof to you??

No, I wonder how you can be stupid enough to keep making factually
incorrect statements, yet remain surprised that anyone would challenge
you on them.
