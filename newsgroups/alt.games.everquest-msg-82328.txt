Velks is a shithole, and a poor example for our discussion. It's way
overcamped, nearly 24/7, and the clerics in our groups are rarely LOM
unless it's just after a new buffing cycle. Tiru probably blows more
mana during the average velks fight on stuns and nukes than she does on
heals. Doesn't stop us from letting me go beserker every couple fights,
though. However, like everyone else, we still go there because of the
nice drop rate of Thurg quest armor gems.

Again. Arrogance and "bossy dorf" syndrome with no logic to back it up.
SteelWarrior has a couple really nice papers on exactly how aggro works,
how the hate list is built, and how people move up and down it. You
should check them out some time. And at your level of the game, people
without a healer will take *any* cleric they can get their hands on if
they are in a pickup/LFG situation.

Again, you're using overcamped Velks with it's crazy ramps, etc. as your
example. Not a typical xp grind place. Oh, and most tanks will survive
the falls in the lower sections quite nicely. But yes, your puller
should always be full when he heads out. Why are your tanks pulling?

You seem to hang out with a lot of bad clerics, if that's the case. Ours
do a lot more than sit in one place, only heal, and let people die if
they have a click stick. This is why pick up groups suck, so I can see
how your experiences may have led you down this path and to these
conclusions. You should really consider getting into a well organized
guild.

That might explain a lot. As above..... p/u groups suck. And the
unguilded people you find in them are often unguilded for *a reason*. I
do feel bad that your experiences have been so negative. It can geta lot
better and I hope it improves for you.

That's a very typical boss mob raid description, whether it's a top end
boss mob, or even a lower one. Sorry you don't like your choice of
class.  I assume you know of some othe brilliant way to keep the MA (and
the rest of the raid as a consequence) alive, than chain CHealing the MA
in cycles?

As per above, please see one of the many excellent online references
detailing how the hate list is built and how it operates. I can be
waaaay up the hate list and nobody else needs to worry when they toss in
a heal, a buff, a DS, a nuke, etc. or I can be one single point above
the next person, and then the mob is suddenly eating casters like potato
chips. Taunt is a pretty straight forward concept if you stop to think
about it. (free hint: more taunt = higher on hate list = more security
for others in party/raid.)

Again, I can only guess that this is because you're unguilded and
dealing with poor quality pickup groups. Our clerics do a lot more than
that. Particularly in close quarters with a lot of possible adds.
(Velks, again, is a terrible example. Try the pool room in the Hole, or
Jail in Velks when the outside guards are respawned.) Tiru constantly
has nukes and stuns memmed up and uses them. Depending on the group
compositin, she'll even have Root memmed, or Atone. All this in addition
to three different heals. When played to the limit, a good cleric is
probably swapping spells in and out all the time, during or between
fights. Most have hot keys for it. A good cleric manages mana and does a
lot more than just heal/buff, particularly if it's a very small party,
or composed of an oddball combination of classes. We regularly have
three and four peson xp groups where she is the only caster of any sort.
Has to wear a LOT of hats then. It can be a fun class to play in those
situations (rooting, stunning, nuking, lulling, mem wiping). The fact
that you are playing with a bunch of ignorant assholes who don't
appreciate the depth of the abilities of your class is no reason to play
it poorly or keep grouping with them.

Defensive is the disc that I look forward to with the most drooling
anticipation. But will I be using it in all my xp groups? Not fucking
hardly. Like anything else, it's a wonderful situational tool, but it
needs to be the right situation. I do my homework. I'm prepared to start
the learning process when I get it. (This week, hopefully). And I know
that you *don't* bother using it in an xp grind camp like Seb Jail,
etc.  If you find yourself in a situation where your tank "suddenly"
needs defensive and doesn't have it, you didn't plan very well. And as
to your damage SINK comment, again, you need to reconsider the issue of
taunt, the hate list, and how they work. We tanks don't get up high on
the hate list by polishing our armor and scowling fiercely, James. :-)

Again, you are judgine me, my groupmates, and my guild based on your own
pickup group experiences. You wouldn't get told that in our groups,
providing you always made sure you had enough mana on hand for that next
critical healing situation. Sorry it's sucked so much for you. As I
said, you should really look into getting into a good guild. Even if
it's not your server's uber raiding guild, you'd get better groups even
in some of the smaller "family style" guilds.

> Especially when your "options" make you a WORSE tank? 

Most of your statements here tell me that you've never played a warrior
in the high end, and you don't really have a comprehensive grasp of the
tank's role, both as MA, and as non-MA, nor how the hate list works.

Nope. Not a frog. Pulled a lot of Undead in Trak's and had her nuke them
to death just for fun. Same with revenants in the Hole. So we have.
What's your point? Again, you've gotten a shitty deal in those pickup
groups, and I do sympathise.

If you're a caster and you don't have gate memmed while grinding xp,
particularly in small dungeon groups with no evac person, you're a fool.
On raids, no. That's a waste of a spell slot when you're just going to
camp anyway in the event of a wipeout.  Tiru does the cleric thing for
other groups as well, without me, and runs the show the same way. You
make no point whatsover by trying to indicate that she's somehow "a
poorer cleric" or "indulging me to be a worse tank" because of our RL
relationship.

You *would* get the same consideration if you grouped with us. As I say,
you've had an awful experience in p/u groups which seems to have
seriously fucked up your attitude towards the other players. I wish you
the best and hope it improves.

And Delores is quickly asked to leave the group as soon as we can find a
more team oriented cleric.
;-)
I think the ONLY reason that you get to stay in groups and get the
impression of being popular (if you really do act that way in game) is
because unguilded clerics are SO freaking rare. And finding a cleric for
a pick-up group is damn near impossible post fifty. So I suppose the
unhappy bastards forced to go LFG all the time who wind up with you will
put up with most any bullshit from you just to have a healer in their
group. I can tell you that attitude wouldn't last long in a guild where
the others had a wide choice of guilded clerics to pick from.
