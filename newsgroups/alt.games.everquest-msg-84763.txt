I'm willing to accept your word about any of that, as none of it impacts me
in the slightest, nor would it if I logged in every day staring at a
character named Lokari.  I say "claim to" to give you the benefit of the
doubt and assume you may have had the common sense to come to the
realization that the "spirit of the law" is more important than the "letter
of the law" and choose to just save face/position here.

inescapably will end up "bound up in semantics".
