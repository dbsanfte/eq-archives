No it didn't. In BB there is a 3-spawn on a 15 minute timer. Once I broke it
up I could kill one in 5 minutes with virtually no health loss (though I was
finishing them off with piercers to get that skill up). Having a Fleeting
Quiver (bow haste 20%) helped. I was getting 2 blue bubbles for 5 kills, I
guess 80 kills at the rate of 12 an hour. Also they dropped on average 3pp
(including sold loot) each. I probably did it as quickly as I could have
solo'd anywhere.
