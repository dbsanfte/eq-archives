And I'm betting you are gonna be very glad indeed to have done that
should the mod rod nerf go in and stay in any form resembling what
they're testing and talking about.  Instead of worrying about roles
for non-Clerics it's gonna be worrying that one of your Clerics might
foolishly use mana for something that somebody else can do, at least
on those raids where massive healing is required to the point that
the mana might run dry.  Of course, that's what VI says they want,
and it would be really cool if they actually hit the target.  Too
bad that their historical accuracy when aiming for small targets like
that is roughly on par with that of a near-sighted drunk firing at
long range from a merry-go-round.
