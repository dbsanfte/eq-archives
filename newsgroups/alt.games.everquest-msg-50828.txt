Although I find this stuff informative, I don't really want to read about it
on a gaming newsgroup anymore.  It's just not appropriate.

One of the things I like about this ng is that it gets me away from the Real
World for a while so that I can relax, and think about something else.  I
can read the news elsewhere.

I don't mind a short lived diversion, but this is really dragging...  I
agree with the others that it's time for this topic to either die, or move
to a more appropriate ng.

Cirian.
