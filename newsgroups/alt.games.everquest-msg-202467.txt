Not sure if it will auto , but you certainly kick to do just that...

No because his account isnt enabled for the those expanded areas - if he
hits th wrong zone they'll check if he can go in by his account and ifhe
cant he'll bounce

Bottom line: This is a server client system - the server controls, the
login tells them who you are so they really really dont care what is n the
machine - nor can what is on the machine you play on affect the account
data held on the server in a way that is over beneficial to you...
