It's also threatening.  And in a country where a homeowner can be sued for 
shooting a burglar, it wouldn't be a very good idea.

The best thing to do would be to speak with your employer, human resources, 
or if it exists, the companies legal department.  Voice your concerns and 
ask for opinions on how you may legally go about identifying the culprit. 
Such activity could very well result in said culprit's termination of 
employment if caught.  But doing anything without employer approval could 
just as easily result in *your* termination of employment.
