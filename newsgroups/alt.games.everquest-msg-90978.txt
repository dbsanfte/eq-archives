Odd that your friend can log your characters on but you can't.
Suggests something on your PC, of course, except you say you
reinstalled from scratch on one machine.  You didn't cheat did you? :)
Like saving your .opt files or something?

I would find out what Options your friend is using (which new models
enabled, etc.), set yours up exactly the same, and see if that fixes
anything.
