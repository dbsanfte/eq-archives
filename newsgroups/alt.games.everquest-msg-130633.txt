Well, some of you may remember that I have been requesting to Verant that my
level 31 wizard, Cursim Mortiss, on Fennin Ro be restored. Well, today I got
the best email ever:

"I am happy to inform you that the restoration of your character(s) has
been completed.  The next time you log on, you will notice that your
situation is resolved."

Whoo! I immediately logged on to see. The loading time took what seemed like
an hour, but who cared! I would have my quad kiting bad ass wizard bac,
right? WRONG! The GM who took care of it restored another character named
Cursim, a level 14 bard. Now, granted I shouldn't have made two characters
with the same name, and as a result the Wizard might me un-restorable. But
if so I wish he would have told me. I replied to his email and again, as
politely as I could, I requested that he restore my wizard.
