More specifically Ali the Elder.

We have been spending a lot of time in PoG lately.  We are usually the only
people in the zone and drops have been pretty good.  I got a Sorcerers Robe
and sleeves, a lot of Rogue and Monk drops off zone trash, etc...

We decided to start on the named mobs the other night.  Tried Treah
Greenroot with 8 people and had her to 12% berfore some of the Sylvan
Protecors repoped and were called in.  Rep'd the Enchanter with a Shaman.
Added two clerics (the druid in charge of all healing on the first pull was
VERY happy).  Rep'd a Paladin with a Shadowknight.  Hehe, Shaman made all
the difference.  She went down quickly and painlessly.  We did get 6 adds at
the end of the fight but we were able to get them as well.

Next we took Undogo Digolo.  For a lvl 65 mob, according to Illia's, he was
way too easy.

Now we are cocky and decide to give Ali the Elder a try.  Hehe, I had never
heard of "silence" before.  Tanks died quickly after that.  20 minute CR and
we called it a night.

The only info I can find on fighting him is that the casters need to stay
out of range and run in to cast between "silence".
What is the range of silence?
Can you stand behind a tree and not get hit?
How do you tell silence spell casting from other spells?

Any hints to finishing him off would be appreciated.

Peace,
