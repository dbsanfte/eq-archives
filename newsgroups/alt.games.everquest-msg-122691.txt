I had someone in EC once telling me I'm ****ing crazy to think anyone would
pay more than 3 gold each for Deathfist Slashed Belts.  I tried to tell him
I often sell them for 3pp on my server, on occasion 2.5pp or 2pp for
quantity and desperation, and on rare occasion 4-5pp to someone who is
desperate enough to offer that much (sold 10 once for 5pp each).
    I asked him if he was so sure 3pp wasn't standard price on that server
to ask for a price check.  He said he was too busy to do this (but not too
busy to keep a constant long conversation with me, without much of a wait
between tells?).  I immediately did a /auction PC on DF belts and got a few
3pp answers back.  He suddenly ignored any further reply.

    Now NPC scams are a different story.  Over the past year I have bought
at least 10 HQ Bear pelts off of a merchant (for about 3 gold each).  Also
bought DF Belts for a gold or two, and bought various other quality pelts
and skins for few silver or gold, selling them back to players for their
standard costs.
    Always buy actionable items from a merchant if buying at lower cost
(especially the HQ bear pelts selling for their few gold).
