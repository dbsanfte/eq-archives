Back out of range of the battle spam, or wait until the fight is over,
and scroll your chat window to show the bozo admitting to beating on
your mob when you've asked him to stop.  Then use "/report [bozo_01]",
and immediately follow it up with "/petition [bozo_01] is not only
KSing but has admitted to it, which you can see in the /report i made
refering to [bozo_01]".  Be sure you give the GM the proper reference
for your /report (i.e. the exact spelling you used for the /report).
Remember that /report only creates a server-side log of the text
currently displayed in your chat window for the GM to examine, you
must still use /petition to get the GM to look at the /report.


 From my own personal experience, as well as what I've heard from other
players, GMs (and Guides) arely respond at all to KSing or training
/petitions unless there are multiple petitions about the same character
(in which case they _may_ show up unannounced and undetectable to try
to catch the jerk in the act) OR the jerk is stupid enough to admit to
it and the victim understands and uses /report with /petition.
