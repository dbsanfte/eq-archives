Dark Elf or Iksar
Prefer Dark Elf myself, though Iksar 'swish' when they cast a spell, which
rocks. And all their extra abilities make life as a necro easier (foraging,
regen, etc.) That xp penalty is really not as bad as it looks.

In any case I'd try to get a ride over to Paineel soonest.. The Warrens are
the bizbomb for xp 4-14
(4-10 you have high xp zone already, x2 for newbie bonus, x2 for being in a
dungeon and under 30)

oh, Dark Elves get Ultravision, best eyesight in the game
