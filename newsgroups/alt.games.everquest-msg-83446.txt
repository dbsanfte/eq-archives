 Don't forget snare, thanks. Lousy DPS output? Perhaps pre-Luclin and
alternate levels. Now you can regularly see Wizards landing critical
nukes for 2k (or more). Plus they can mana burn once every 2.5 hours or
so I think. Apparently a wizard soloed Phinny in Kedge Keep by landing a
critical strike on a mana burn. He did something like 16k damage with
one nuke. Of course, getting a crit on mana burn doesn't happen very
often so you shouldn't figure that in.

 They do.

(Disclaimer: I've speaking of wizards near the upper 50s and 60)

 Ask the level 60s who are doing AE in places like Acrylia Caverns that
can do pulls of 40+ mobs and you'd see. Also, it's great fun to AE Plane
of Fear and Chardok Royals.

 Low levels solo you're probably right. Get some more levels and an
Enchanter (Or cleric as well I think) who can AE stun in the picture and
what do you see? Yeah, a lot of stunned mobs getting the crap nuked out
of them.
