My pally leveled fairly quickly from 39 to 42 soloing Shakrn Meadowgreen and
chargers at the centaur village in South Karana.  Shakrn has a 6 minute
respawn and other centaurs won't add unless they're dark blue.  Good loot,
gems, chainmail, pp and there's a vendor right there.  Very rarely camped.
Kill green centaurs while waiting for Shakrn to respawn to get more chargers
to spawn.
