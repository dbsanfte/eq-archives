I find the whole tactic of 'splitting' and 'pulling' to be 'cheesy' and 'gamey'

Why not just storm the place and kill everything all at once? You know
a battle? A war?
Makes more sense in a fantasy / medieval kind of way. In any fantasy
book you ever read was there a 'puller?' If I show up at a giant strong
hold with an army why would they come at me one at a time? Shouldn't
the front gate guards sound an alarm or something?

With the game as it is currently the mobs have so many abilities
and hit points to counter the PC advantage of numbers and the 'split'
'single pull' that it gets ridiculous. The game should be about having fun
and adventuring, not about calculating your hp/ac/mana to the 4th decimal
or about timing a complete heal rotation to the millisecond.
I mean WTF is that?
