I'd have to say that the Bard is the hardest class to play - Carpal Tunnel
is not on my wish list, definitely a hard way to play. Wizards are tough to
play *well* and are usually forced to solo as for some reason they find it
hard to find groups. This has never been an issue with me though, I prefer
to solo.

Enchanters are hard to play well, they have the largest selection of spells
in the game - picking the right spells to use for the situation means some
careful thinking must be applied.

Druids - well, I've never played a Druid, but I've to say that they'd more
than likely be the easiest of all classes to play. They have it all really,
tracking, SoW, heals, good damage output, shields that are (I think)
component free, they quad, port, they're a great all-round class, hence
their popularity.

Safe hunting to you all ..

Stevie.
