The energy it has at the end of the arc is the same energy it had at the
begining.

As the arrow is shot, PE increases, while KE decreases.  As it begins to
fall, PE decreases, KE increases.  Net energy is constant, save friction
losses.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.

--Megumi Hayashibara, Sakura Saku
