I think everyone who uses it are dirty, lying, cheating scumbags. I
think buying/selling items for RL cash in a game is cheating. It is my
opinion also that this is a breach of copyright, and SHOULD be
outright illegal as much as copying and selling DVDs you borrowed from
a friend.

Most people here are strongly against this practice, and you would do
well to change your handle and never mention it again if you wish to
continue posting here without being killfiled.
