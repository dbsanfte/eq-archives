You are more or less right - it refers to shops you would walk into
off the street (as opposed to etailers etc).  Most UK towns would have
a "High Street" where the major chain store retailers would have a
branch, as well as banks, the post office etc.  Not forgetting the
ubiquitous McDonalds / Burger King and KFC :)

As to where it came from.../shrug.  It's not used in Ireland where I'm
from, but is used in the UK a lot.  My best guess would be that
towns/forts would have been built on hills (more defensible) and that
the shops would have congregated together there, and the locals could
have referred to it as high as it was higher than their farms??? 
Still, as I said, it's just a guess.

Tzen.
