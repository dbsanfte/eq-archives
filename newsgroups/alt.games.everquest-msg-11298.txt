For you and the dozens of others commenting, remind me never to post
screenshots to share with you all again. I happen to *like* the screen
mode for "newbies" where I can see all my options easily. I have a very
large monitor and can see all the action just fine. I am also colorblind
and cannot see a  lot of the text in half screen mode because all the
colors change and it's too much of a PITA to try to adjust it all. It
works for me, and I've made it to level 33 with one character in fairly
short order using it. You do it your way, I'll do it mine.
