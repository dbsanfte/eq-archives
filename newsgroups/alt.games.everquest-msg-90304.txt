They're just so damn useful on the run.  I've pretty much went from
Palm (pro?) -> CE2.0 -> Palm IIIc -> PocketPC and used the hell out of
all of 'em.  Pity I can't decide which I like the best...  lots of
pros and cons.

Once I get past this whole unemployment thing I think I'm going to
look at Sony's color palm.  Appears to be at a high resolution and I
sure do like how THIN (not to mention battery life) the Palm derived
units are.
