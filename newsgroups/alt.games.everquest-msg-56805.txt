Well I've earned enough now I can die without losing my level, so I think
I'll try this just as an experiment.

And the brownie scouts, and Wayfear, the pained unicorn, and etc ad
infinitum. Like I said originally, I -HATE- this zone.

This is funny, but I was in camo'd up at the entrance from GFay and a
little lvl 6 druid was hunting the zone. There was also a 29 war I had
sowed and camo'd for a CR into MM. Just us three. The little druid sent
out a shout asking why the zone was so empty with the good hunting.

A few ooc's from I and the warrior later, he and I were the only ones left
in the zone ;-)
