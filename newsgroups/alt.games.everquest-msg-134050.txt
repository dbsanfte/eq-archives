Heh, maybe I'm a savant (idiot?) but some things just stick in my brain. 
I don't claim to know everything, but the things that pertain to a class 
I'm currently "into" seem to stick. I was pleasantly surprised when I 
saw that patch message because I thought to myself "now I might actually 
be able to be in a group and use my pet and not be a low powered 
wizzie". I don't know the answer to everything, even about my main class 
(rogue), but if it's a class I play, I certainly pay attention and make 
it "stick".

Oh, if I'm wrong I expect to get stomped.. it's usenet after all. I'm of 
the "If you want it done right do it yourself" attitude. If I want to 
know something I'll research it myself first.. THEN come here and post. 
I'm not saying I'll get the wrong answer here, but 9 out of 10 posts I 
see have at least ONE conflicting viewpoint. And that just leads to more 
confusion for me. To each his/her own I guess.
