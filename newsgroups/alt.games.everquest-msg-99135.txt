I got my cleric up to the start of 9 before the big patch. I couldn't afford
to even then by all my 8th level spells, and I was collecting and selling
everything, even the crap that gives you 8 coppers! Yup casters are gonna
have trbl  getitng their spells if they get no hand outs.

And boy did 9 to 10 fly by after the patch, although 10 has slowed down
enormously.

I originally thought, bah what a stupid time for me to have started my
cleric. But now I'm quite glad. Got more spells and skills than I would have
had, had I started him subsequently....

Cheers

Kev
