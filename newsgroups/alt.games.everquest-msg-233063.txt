Subject: Can you heal someone who is *feared*???

We tried to kill Faydedar tonight and failed.  Needed more people but anyway...
I am *positive* my heal should have taken in time but the warrior didn't heal. 
He *was* showing LD and walking away from battle at the time.  He was not out
of range - well I don't think he was.  (Actually I am pretty sure he was still
wandering around feared when Faydedar killed me... )
But I never got a message that said "your target is out of range" or "your
target is feared" or anything like that... 
So that's my question:  can you heal someone who's out of their mind?
