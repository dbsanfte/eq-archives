}> Counts?  Explain please.
}Your chance of drawing a needed card are y in x , where y is one of the
}total cards that would satisfy what you need and x is the total number of
}cards left . Usually people harp on card counters because if you can
}actually keep track of 52 ,156 , or 364 cards you can substantially change
}the odds . Casinos in particular run on a 5-10% profit margin and dislike
}people who can change those odds enough to consistently win .
}
}Counting isnt cheating though . marking is .

Counting _is_ considered cheating at Blackjack or 21.  I think the 
question was, what's it got to do with poker, where it's just good 
strategy?
