Of course, that has nothing to do with the fact that there's sooo much
better than SP gloves and PoO out there, right? And that Black pearls
are pretty useless compared to other jewelry gems? On the GEBs, if
they ever went for 5k, that was more than 3 years ago (first time I
checked). They were going for 2-3k then. They've doubled that within
the past couple months, by the way.
