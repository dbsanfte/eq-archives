Best Thing I ever saw I just about died laughing.  I was on my shammy,
talking in tells to a friend I had just made.  He is an iksar warrior.  Some
guy walks up to him hails him and asks him to cast temp on him LOL.  And
there had just been a mgb of kei and whatnot at the big bank so there were
lots of people there to hear it.  I can imagine many were in same boat I was
in.  Couldn't type I was laughing so hard.

And on my shaman on Morden Rasp shes lvl 6 so doesn't have sow yet.  I was
standing in North Qeynos helping a friend and someone walks up to me and
litterally demands a SOW.  I said "firstly you didn't ask nicely secondly
I'm only lvl 6".
And on another note that same day I had someone constantly inviting me into
group.  For me that is a real pet peeve.  I hate when people don't say
anything to you and just hit invite.  I mean at least say hi or want to
group or something.  I kept hitting decline group and they kept hitting
invite.  So finally I said if you don't stop it I'll report you for
harassment.  That stopped them.
