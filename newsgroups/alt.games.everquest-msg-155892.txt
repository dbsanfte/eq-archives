In a 2 week period (or 3 weeks, cant remember), VI made the Large Sewing 
Kit 10 slots. But that made the tailoring community very mad since it 
destroyed their backpack market (know the toolboxes are 10 slot too, but 
weight a lot more than the Large/Deluxe did/does). Then at next patch, 
they changed the large ones back to being 8 slots.
But since a lot of people had in the meantime bought the 10 slots and 
used them in banks and on inventory, all existing Large kits were made 
to Deluxe kits, 10 slot containers.

This means its kinda hard finding them nowadays, since they will slowly 
be cleared from the game (people stopping, non-tailors switching their 
inventory ones for 10 slot backpacks or better and destroying kit).

To make the 9-10 item tailoring recipes youll need to go to a town and 
find a loom. Theyre 10 slots, and work just as a normal tailoring kit. 
Unless they fixed it, they can be hard to get to work, try clicking at 
the top of the loom, near the upper piece of wood.

Dont know if anyone are selling them any more. I personally sold 3 of my 
bank ones when i seen people auction for them. First person offered 
500pp, and i of course took it and replaced bank slot with a 10 slot 
toolbox (before Luclin), the next 2 offered 1K and 1500pp. So made quite 
a profit from them, but wouldnt dream of paying money like that 
personally, since around the only stuff you need them for at the moment 
are Wu Gi (and legs? Cant remember), and maybe some of the "new" CT items.

So unless you REALLY need to be able to make Wu armor while your 
hunting, start looking for one. If not, dont bother, go to a town and 
find a loom, or maybe buy one if someone is auctioning for 50-100pp, 
they not really worth more than that, apart from being a nice rare 
tradeskill item you can own :)
