Hey! Dont trash the hotdog vendors. A friend of mine is a self
employed hotdog vendor and makes a six figure salary. He doesnt do
that by screwing people who complain....he either gives them another
one or gives them their money back. At his location he doesnt want
unhappy people coming by because those same people shop there all the
time. Relating that to Verant, they have a LOT of people who could
just as easily play AO, DAoC or any other such game. If they dont keep
the customers happy (be they right or wrong) then let the market
dictate what happens, I used to play Diablo until every server was so
choked with koreans that you couldnt log on and when you did you
couldnt game with anyone. Lets see...the D2 expansion pack has been
out a couple months and still havent bought it yet....hmm...maybe they
need to think about the customers for a change. (in their defense, at
least D2 can be played solo without a net connection.....but its
boring, people like online games.)
