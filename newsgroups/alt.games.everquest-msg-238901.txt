Please call 911. I fear I have ruptured my diaphram laughing.

Ok, place your bets. Did they...
1.) Once again break it even worse than it already was?
2.) Actually correct *A* faction issue, but the rest are still broke?
3.) Correct all the NPC's factions, but made all wizards KOS now?
4.) Somehow, some way, beyond belief, actually make the wizard epic 
doable without having to either do days of tedious shaman epic faction 
hits to be able to deal with the NPC's or have somebody invis you and 
hope the NPC does't eat the bag for your final turnin?
