I used to use this song as a pick up line. Get down on one knee, hold 
their hand, and sing clearly. If they didn'the jerk their hand away and 
found it entertaining, they were worth considering. If they joined in, 
they were a keeper.

Never did find anyone who joined in while I was still in the dating pool 
though. Now I just do it for entertainment value. =) Nothing quite like 
singing for the Queen on demand...
