Why have the media refused to report this story?


Malaika Tamu Griffin is wanted for the murder of twenty-five-year old Jason
Horsely. In early 1999, Griffin was a tenant at a neighboring home to Mr.
Horsely and his girlfriend, Deborah Loiselle. On April 20, 1999, on their
first encounter Ms. Loiselle was threatened by Ms. Griffin who expressed
anti-white animus and stated that she would kill her and kill her dogs .
Mr. Horsely and Ms. Loiselle are white and Ms. Griffin is African-American.
Ms. Griffin continued her tirades against her neighbors despite the fact
that there was no actual provocation.

On the evening of May 18, 1999, Mr. Horsley was assembling carpentry tools
on a public sidewalk near Ms. Griffin's house. After Ms. Griffin verbally
castigated Horsely, Ms. Loiselle entered the argument. Both females
returned to their residences and Jason resumed his work. Shortly thereafter
and without warning Ms. Griffin returned to the sidewalk armed with a
laser-sighted 9mm pistol and shot Mr. Horsely in the back at point-blank
range. Mr. Horsely died minutes later from a fatal heart wound. 

While in immediate flight Ms. Griffin encountered an acquaintance who she
proceeded to carjack at gunpoint. Ms. Griffin drove to Iowa and proceeded
to board a bus to Chicago where she was last seen. 

A police search of Griffin's Denver residence uncovered a cache of
ammunition, diffused hand grenades, a 9mm assault rifle and manuals popular
with terrorists including The Anarchist's Cookbook and The Poor Man's James
Bond. Police also found notebooks with Griffin's opinions about a coming
race war and the necessity of killing white people. None of her colleagues
or close friends ever heard her express the types of racist rhetoric she
wrote in her notebooks.

Ms. Griffin has a BS in Chemistry from Jackson State University where she
graduated magna cum laude. She has experience in production laboratory and
chemical research settings. Ms. Griffin's primary area of expertise are in
the analysis of organic compounds by high pressure liquid chromatography
(HPLC) using ultraviolet and fluorescence detectors and ion chromatography
for the determination of anions in air and water. She has also worked in
pharmacies.

She should be considered extremely dangerous
