I did a bit of that with the engineer, but it got a bit bewildering 
figuring out what he was attacking; there's probably a simple way to 
target pet and assist or something that I was missing, anyway, it seemed 
easier to pick a target and send him to it.

A powerful enough pet could just harvest mobs in hunt mode without me 
having to lift a finger, this worked among the beach leets for example, 
seemed almost abusive, except that eventually the fact that the pet 
wasn't getting any stronger meant that I had to help out as his targets 
were tougher, and then I had to tank, because he really couldn't.  I'm 
sure there are upgrades to the pet out there, "Engineer Automaton I" 
isn't likely what I'm supposed to be using at level 6.

Yep, being able to fine tune a bit can certainly be handy, particularly 
with solo missions, I'm just concerned that this may also lead to 
boredom.  I've started experimenting with tuning my character to face a 
wider variety, and leaving as many bars in the middle as I can get away 
with, to prevent that happening.

Haven't managed to find a lockpick yet.  Have done about 6 missions, 
though,and only that one locked chest ever.

OH, tokens.  So, if you succede on a mission, you get a token.  If you 
are on a faction (not nuetral), you can apply that token to the neck 
item they gave you, and eventually it will get better; my Omni neck will 
apparantly give me +45 hp when I get ten tokens.

Well, what I didn't realize is that you are supposed to click on the 
token to put it on your neck item.  Which wouldn't matter much, except 
that it also seems that you can only ever have one token unclicked at 
any time; so I went thru 6 missions and still had only one token.  Now I 
know better, but thats a learning experience.

Looked around an apartment, got a special key for it... three empty 
rooms, seems pointless so far.

The place you are talking about seems to be a Backyard, and it looks 
like those are the original newbie areas for the game, the door said I 
couldn't leave till I reached level 2 or had 1000 credits.  In addition 
to some information places, there was a hologram simulation training 
area where you could run around and fight... and not only was there a 
boss mob that dropped some nice stuff, there was a vendor with much 
better selection than on the newbie island, including the thing I most 
lamented, AMMO.

There was also a mission generator and a mission room, but the generator 
said it didn't have any missions, dunno if thats because of my level or 
its been disabled.

I've encountered even more strangeness, an item, for example, that took
two minutes greyed out, then told me my tutoring skill was available. 
What it did, I'm not at all sure!

I bought a backpack, which opens to give an extra 16 spaces or so, very 
handy investment as I've been forced to guess which items will sell for 
the least and start throwing things away; I'm buying more of those. 
While there's more starting spaces than the 8 in EQ, there's so much 
more seemingly good junk dropping in AO that storage space is just as 
much at a premium.
