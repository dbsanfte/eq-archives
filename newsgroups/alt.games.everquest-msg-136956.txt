For good reason.  Why did the MT think that it was HIS job to save the
cleric?  At MOST he should have had some other taunting class turn around
and just TAUNT the critter beating on the cleric until the enchanter took
care of the problem.

Clerics save enchanters
Enchanters save clerics
Tanks kill stuff.  They need brains enough to assist,  manage aggro, manage
critter location and LISTEN to instructions.  That's enough
responsibility...nowhere in there is "crowd control." <g>

Obviously roles modify a little if there's no crowd control class, but even
then, clerics are better at CC (root/atone) than tanks.
