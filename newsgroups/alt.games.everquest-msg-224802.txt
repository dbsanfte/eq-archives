This sounds like my experience. I put points into pottery to get it to
21, then medium jars took 224 combines to trivialize vs 50 mentioned in
the guide, and the next 3 skill ups were from the recommended medium
bowls and took 96 combines.

I'll go compare the prices on materials for small and medium bowls right
now. I have both my Drinal beastlords working on the Vah Shir quests as
well, so if you also know of any asylums with reasonable rates I'd
appreciate that advice as well ;-)

Thanks all, for your, as usual, great advice!
