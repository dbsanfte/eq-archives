Bandage solution. Disband in advance of the pull, pull, FD, group pulls 
retreating mob, join group...admittedly more work, but if it means risk 
free spawn breaking...

Hell... if its just a matter of breaking a spawn... he won't even bother 
joining the group...  first break the spawn ungrouped and then join the 
group... the lost xp is irrelevant.
