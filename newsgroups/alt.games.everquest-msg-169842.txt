They have allready made levels 1 to 50 quicker than before by removeing the
hell levels or sommothing them out.
The lower levels were fun to play where as now the 50 pluss or 60 pluss game
seemes stressfull where you and other guilds
end up raceing for Uber_Mob_01 etc

As a newbiee long ago it was great when you finaly got to level 35 or 45
cant remember and you didnt have to stare at that dam book to med mana back,
and going on your very first plane raid to Fear or Hate, those were the days
=)
