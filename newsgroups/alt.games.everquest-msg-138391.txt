Oh god, when it comes to raiding new & exciting places in your 30s you've
got a HELL of a lot of great choices...some aren't even known to level 60s
very well (even when they were in their 30s).

Dalnir (little hole in the ground in Warsilk's)
Crystal Caverns (off of Eastern Wastes)
Droga (FM)
SolA
SolB
LGuk

Dalnir and CC probably have the best loot.  Dalnir is more interesting (to
me) than CC, but CC is very fun.  The rest of the zones have some good loot
as well but are too well known (except droga).
