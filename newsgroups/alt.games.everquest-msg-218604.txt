A lot depends on the specific Celeron and Pentium in question.  There can 
be a huge difference between specific versions of the Celeron at the same 
clock speed, and the same is true of Pentiums.  In general, talking about 
Celeron vs Pentium from about the same time frame, even at the same clock 
speed, the Celeron is quite inferior.
