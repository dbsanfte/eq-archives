If the software lets you resize the main explorer window on the fly (
article says it can ), or better yet, lets you hide it behind the XSides
software, then this could be a viable solution for the people who want to
run EQ in a window.  It could be pretty scary to see EQ get resized on the
fly.

1) XSides tells Windows that it now only has an 800x600 area to work with
instead of 1024x768.
2) Windows then sends out a message to all the current software to resize to
its "new" size.
3) EQ freaks out.

Hopefully, this won't happen.  My money is on the fact that it will freak
and will probably leave you in a state of not being able to use any hotkeys
as if you had [CTRL]-[ESC]d out and then got back in to EQ.

It says that XSides talks directly to the hardware, so I foresee some
possible video problems resulting from this software in general.

All in all, I applaud them if it works!  I doubt they have EQ in mind, but
they will get a LOT of people pirating, uh, buying it who play EQ if it does
indeed work.

Then, of course, Verant will change the DirectX-## code to trap any
resolution changes not instigated by the EQ software itself and crash you to
the Desktop or something.

Just build a tiny linux box that can handle X-Windows and run your internet
through it so you can browse and play at the same time.  THAT's the best
solution.
