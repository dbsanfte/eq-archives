The *people* gives the goverment the right to tell you their plan for 
your business.

There is simply the fact that we don't live in a vacuum, and whatever we 
do has far reaching consequences. While a two-person arts and crafts 
store is verly unlikely to attract too much regulation, a massive 
steelworks will impact thousands of people, whether they work there or 
not, therefore regulation is very necessary.

We have been there. We have had absolutely free-wheeling capitalism, in 
the 1850s. We have learnt from that and moved away from it. Do you really 
want to go back to the days of 11-year olds working sixteen-hour days in 
the mines and pollution so thick you could chew the coal dust in the air? 
Sorry, but state regulation is there as a counterbalance for greed, and I 
wouldn't do without it.
