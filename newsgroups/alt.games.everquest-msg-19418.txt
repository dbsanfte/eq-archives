Is there some reason to think that I would try to deny this?

I am not on one side or the other of the e-bay question. I don't care if
someone sells items or accounts, nor do I care if they are unable to do so.
I may feel different, if I ever get to a sufficiently high enough level for
it to bother me.

What I would like to see, is the matter go to court, and find out what side
a judge may come down on. I would like to see exactly what legal standing
the EULA has. Despite what everyone says, no-one knows what might happen for
sure.

No, I would say you are stealing someones property. You have their software,
yet they do not have your dollars. A simple case, to me.

What isn't so simple to me is; what sort of loss Sony has incurred when
someone has sold an item, or an account. It seems if an account is sold,
they are financially better off than they would be, if the player had just
quit and deleted his account. If someone sells an item, I can see no loss at
all for Sony.

There's a million shades of grey between what's ok, and walking down the
street with a megaphone.

Of course no-one believes it. People argue it, because it can be hard to
refute. The whole policy is unenforceable, and because it is unenforceable,
people ignore it. They then justify their actions in a way that circumvents
Sony's policy.

If you found an ironclad argument that shot down the "but I'm only selling
my time" argument, they would switch to another argument equally vapid. The
ease with which this can be done shows exactly how unenforceable the policy
is.
