It isnt supposed to be a nice reward . just a useable piece of equipment
since no other such piece is around . Time to achieve is the normal cost for
any equipment and oddly enough the game certainly does have a restriction
placed on high levels camping. The 55 necro you are disparaging only gets to
do anything for 30 seconds every 26 minutes while an appropriate level group
will be on the brink of extinction every second that they are there.

What the pro-Tlc crowd just ignores is that there are no suffering newbies
to protect ! The incidence of high levels camping green mobs to sell to
newbies has got to be rarer than winning the damn lottery . ANY such
instance can be traced to a major flaw in the item placement and nothing
else. And even then the play nice policy ALWAYS will fix the problem of this
poor suffering newbie . I have been low level 6 times now and know perfectly
well the chance of getting a well balanced below level 40 group together for
dungeon crawling is nil . I to have been in all the mid level zones and you
know what? They are empty ! Not only that but the servers are aging , a low
level character is almost always a twink .
