Well i'm new to these sort of games so I really need somewhere to ask 
questions etc. Suprisingly the EQ usenet group isnt that busy, so I have to 
use the official forums. To put it bluntly they are pathetic. Seriously, 
they are incredibly slow and the actual forum software is akward and non 
user friendly. They would have been far better off using the very popular 
phpBB software.

On a similar point, did the developers simply miss out most aspects of the 
game in the manual. I was a lvl15 predator before I knew you could use 
poision on your blades. The manual didnt mention this at all and it's been 
in the game from the beginning. I could understand if the feature was added 
in the patch but this wasnt the case.

The same thing can be said of crafting your own food, without actual details 
of what each food does and how it effects recovery etc whats the point? 
Surely someone must have mentioned this during the beta.

I dont want to sound negative as I really like EQ2 but there seem to a LOT 
of annoying gameplay features that kill the experience for me personally.
