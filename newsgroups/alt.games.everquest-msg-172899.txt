IT sounds like the War on the  giants (#10) quest.  War with the giants.
Awsome fun if it is set up corectly.  I was passing through doing my second
ring when someone called that they where going to start the war in 20 min.
I lasted about 5 minutes (Lvl 38 at the time maybe 40 don't remember)  YOu
have wave after wavecoming at youwith a mini boss after each wave.  The last
boss droups what you need to compleat the quest.  The loot is about average
for Giant's  good plat though.  THe Person that realy benifits is the one
that started the fight as they can now get the coveted Ring of Dain
Frostreaver IV (10 Ac, 10 Str, 10 Sta, +10 SvM,  100 HP:Effect Frostreavers
Blessing -  +10Hp per Tick, IncreaseDamage shield by 10(add's to any damadge
shield you have, or is a stand alone 10hp DS), Increase ATK by 10) It is
insta click and last's for 60 minutes per click.

Good luck getting it.  The 9 quest to get there are frustrating, but worth
it. ANd some of there reward's are worth while.
