You have the strategy down now, it just sounds like you have people in
the raid not bothering to follow it. If they are in proper position it's
rare to get knocked to the wall, and in the event someone does, they
aren't supposed to run agro back to the raid. That's just selfish. If
they stand at the wall and die a rogue can easily pull them back to the
center for rezzing, and they don't train the wall adds on your raid and
wipe everyone else out. 

IV is one of those raids that starts to seperate the tagalongs from
the people that are there to raid. You need to identify the people not
paying attention and get them to turn off the tv.
