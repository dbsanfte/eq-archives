The Hand of Ixiblat has a minimum level 10 to proc. Blade of Kedge and
Walnan require a minimum level of 40.

I am pretty sure that my pet (level 20 necro) proc the Hand. Not often
but it does. I know enough that the two Blades need 40 since my 51
enchanter pet is actually level 38, so the Blades I got it didn't (lack
the will), sniff.

Proc depend on the pet's dex to actually fire. As an experiment, I had
a shaman put Focus on my pet (enchanter) and it seemed like the Hand
did fire more often. Also the 20 necro pet did appear to proc.

Heck, when the necro was leveling in Kurns with summoned swords of
runes, I'd get occasional, "Your pet's will is insufficient to control
the weapon" when fighting skeletons. Given that the sword of runes has
a minimum level 20 or 30? to proc, I was actually quite surprised to
get that message.
