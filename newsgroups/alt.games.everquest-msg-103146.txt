Hi

I finally managed to find someone to make me some clear mana, got the mana,
made the idols, and now i'm stuck.  To fire it one needs a HQ firing sheet
and Divine Crystalline Glaze.  Somehow i thought this glaze would be for
sale.  It is not.

According to EQtraders, Divine Crystalline Glaze, made in a glaze mortar, is
made with white lead, flask of water, iron oxide, and permafrost crystals in
a glaze mortar. White lead is rogue-made by combining lead sulfide and
limestone in a mortar and pestle. Iron Oxide is a ground spawn in Steamfont
and Permafrost Crystals are a ground spawn in Permafrost.

Okay...well and good...where the heck do i get Lead sulfide and limestone?
And what is the trivial on it for the rogue who makes it?  How much does the
entire combination of white lead go for (appx)?

Thanks,
Raven
