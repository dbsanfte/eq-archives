Actually the Melee damage king is the Rogue not the monk.
However, that is only if the Rogue has the mobs back. Then
the monk is #2 damage dealer. Monks get some pretty awesome
weapons to deal damage and their skills are usually a bit
higher than everyone else's. Also, the monks have a different
'damage table' that is used internally in the game to calculate
damage.

Monks really start doing serious damage level 45 and up.
Best advice I can give you is get the best haste item you can
get your hands on as soon as you can. Then upgrade from there.
Start thinking about your epic, you can do a lot of the ground work
for it early like the sash and headband quests.

Keep your hand-to-hand and 2hb skills up, as well as your 1hb of
course.

Oh and go read this site:

The forums are great place to get monk info.
