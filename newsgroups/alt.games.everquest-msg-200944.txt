Depends on how high you're looking at taking 'em.

Tailoring is pretty cheap up to 158, but be prepared to spend a lot of time 
farming.  OTOH you can get to 76 in an hour if you want to blow a big chunk 
of cash on mandrake roots.

Smithing is cheap to 132, but you'll need to learn fishing in the process.  
You'll even make a nice chunk of money raising it to this level once you 
start making cultural needs (cost about 4pp to make, sells to vendor for 
9ish).  I like fishing for clockwork koi out of Ak'Anon and making the 
clockwork needles, but whatever floats your boat.  After that you're 
looking at a serious money and/or time sink.

http://www.eqtraders.com/ for all things tradeskilled.  Check the "Learn a 
skill" link and then click on the skill you want to learn, most of 'em have 
3 or 4 guides on how to get started.  I used Monual's for smithing, though 
it's for higher level characters who just want the skill as quickly as 
possible.

HTH,
