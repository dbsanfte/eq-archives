<snip story>

There's not a lot you could have done with a gating mob.

The paladin, cleric or chanter might have stunned it, or the paladin
(if they were using a shield) might have tried to bash it,
but that's the total of your options.

The best defense against this is to know what mobs gate
and make sure someone is on the ball ready to stun it or
nuke it when it tries to gate (you're given a message to
that effect).
