The original adventure game was an incorrect usage . Grue is not a creature
type its a disgusting substance type. Basically a good definition would be
rotted meat and body parts. Is still in common usage in its children words
like gruesome (some is like , so is like grue) . Or gruel ...

Think offal would be the next closest word.
