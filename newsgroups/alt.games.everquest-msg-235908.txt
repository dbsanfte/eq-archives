I can't see it this way.  The main difference is that the IRS is
involuntary.  If I'm deciding to buy or sell based on tribute values, I'm
making that decision based on the current exchange rate.  It's an offer SoE
made and I decided to take or not take based on the circumstances.  The IRS
just takes and there's nothing you can do about it.

But, if you're going to use the IRS example it would be more like "Hey,
guys, we have new tax tables.  I know many of you have already filed, and
already spent the refunds, but we just didn't think the old tables brought
in enough income, so we had congress retroactively raise taxes."
