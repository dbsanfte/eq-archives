I don't know why people are so down on NT platforms.  I ran my current
office win2000 machine for 6 months before the company came out and said I
had to shut it down at night for power conservation.  At a previous office,
I never turned the NT4 machine off in two years.  Rebuilt my Solaris 2.5.1
machine 3 times due to various hardware failures.  Now, if my wife looks at
a computer is starts having problems.  I think is personal electromagnetic
field.

Cheers,
Eric
