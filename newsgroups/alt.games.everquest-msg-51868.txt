Ohh I cna help you here...
1) I did those levels (27-35) in High Keep too
keep up AE Stun, AE Mez, Enthrall, Tepid Deeds, Tash, Curse if you want it
(I didnt notice anything big with this spell... then again I didnt get it
til 52), Root/Enstill, Alacrity

Ways to make the groups like you and kick out their current enchy for you:
NEVER let their buffs die, if you got a stopwatch around, keep an eye on it.
Swap Clarity in and out with Alacrity, and also if youre bored give them an
option between aug and alacrity.
If you have multiple pops, easiest way ive found to fix that is AE Stun,
mez. if you get trained, thats when you put the AE Mez to use. It will be
hard to do it though - if you have anything agrod on you, you might be
better off casting the mez on yourself, but if youre free go in the hall and
cast. Try to not let your mana drop below 30

2) Go for Enthrall, if I remember right twice the mana cost but lasts 2x as
much if not a few more secs. Easier to use, cause it takes about 40 secs to
kill the mobs in there with an avg group, no need to recast unless multiples

3) Embroidered Black cape would probably help, it drops in lower guk. same
mob also drops something else that might be useful but I forgot...
I suggest you move to lguk after HK. You can start in your low 30s
As your level goes up though you can get into some more rooms (btw the armor
i said above drops near the ass/sup, you shouldnt have too much trouble
getting there with a group in low 30s, I forgot name of the mob check
http://www.eqlizer.net for the lguk mob info). anyways as you get higher
there will be other stuff you can use, the ghoul sage drops 2 items, both of
them which I still use alot, a belt with 4 int and the runed cowl, 5 wis 9
int 2 ac (head).
Other than that enchies got high demand there, watch out for competition =P
