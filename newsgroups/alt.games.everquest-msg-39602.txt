You dont understand. I *am* a hybrid, level 53, and I *do* understand
how my combat damage works.

The change made does not permit you to swing during a spell cast, merely
immediately after it completes. Prior to the change your weapon swing timer
would start at the end of the spell.

Old method:

[ spell cast 2 seconds ] [ weapon swing 3 seconds ] = total 5 seconds

New method:

[ spell cast 2 seconds ]
[ weapon swing 3 seconds        ]  = total 3 seconds

Now, if your weapon is a 1 second delay and the mainhand dmaage bonus
is insignificant (as it is pretty much all the time below level 45-50),
it looks like this:


[ spell cast 2 seconds ] *2pts*
[ wp swing 1 ] .........[ wp swing 2] *2pts*

You *lose* a swing in that last second of casting. If your weapon is the
same ratio (say 3 damage 3 seconds instead of 1 damage 1 second)

[ spell cast 2 seconds ] *2pts*
[ wp swing 3                        ] *3 pts*

You have now gained the damage of the spell in addition to the full damage
per second of your weapon without losing any damage.

If you add in aggro issues with faster weapons (aggro builds per swing, not
damage done) then faster is NOT always better. 

Ok little rant coming up:

I WISH people would stop listening to HIGH LEVEL GAME information, fail
to understand it and apply it to the lower levels. If I hear one more
person talk about how they need a goddam cleric or enchanter or a warrior
because no other class can perform that role at level 15 cause they're
main/friend/sister/web site poster/dog said it was requried at the last
ToV raid I'll SCREAM.

The game dynamics change *substantially* at different level points.

FASTER ... IS... NOT... ALWAYS... BETTER

OK!

Sui, calmer now ;)
