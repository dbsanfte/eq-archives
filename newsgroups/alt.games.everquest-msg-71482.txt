Read that review.  The author(s) are obviously EQ biased but he/she/it has
no problem criticizing the downsides, especially right now.

EQ is damned addictive.  If you have a family and like to see them
occasionally or don't want to lose your wife or girlfriend (unless you can
get them hooked too) don't buy the game.

I'd also recommend waiting a few weeks.  With the new expansion the patching
and bugs are likely to really turn you off to the game.  In a few weeks
it'll be smooth again.   Errr, on second thought maybe you SHOULD buy it
now...it'll save your social life. :)
