Like many gamers, I've been reluctant to replace my trusty CRT with an LCD.
While I used to play many games, nowadays I play mostly EQ2, so my concern
is how EQ2 will perform with any new hardware I use.  Given the demands of
the EQ2 graphics, I'm sticking with my 21" Trinitron.  However, I also do a
good bit of digital photography and editing, so last week I purchased a
Samsung 913v 19" LCD ($375) from Sam's for a machine I built for use with
Photoshop and Premiere.  The specs of the monitor are good enough for what I
do, even with the analog input.  Given its 25ms response time, it never
crossed my mind that I could use it for EQ2.  However, while I had it hooked
up to my gaming rig for initial setup (while I finished the other computer),
I logged on and played some EQ2.  I was blown away by the performance!!  I
expected massive ghosting and blur, but during a couple of hours of some
pretty serious fighting, I experienced virtually NO ghosting or blur.  And
the game looks great.

Your mileage may vary.  I just wanted to report a positive experience with a
25ms RT LCD.  The gaming rig is:

AMD Athlon Barton core 2500+ oc'ed to 2.4ghz
Abit NF7 motherboard
1gb Kingmax PC3500 RAM
Nvidia 6800 non-ultra 128mb

Also, the software that came with the Samsung is really good.  I provides
for a tremendous amount of control over the color and gamma of the monitor.
For the price, I'm very, very satisfied.  And it's nice to have the option
of gaming on it.  I even ran 3DMark01 SE to see what 300fps looked like,
and, again, virtually not ghosting.  It makes me wonder how monitor
manufacturers determine response time.  I've seen more ghosting on monitors
rated at 16ms.  It could be like other "standards."  Perhaps they're not
"standard" at all, but rather up to the discretion of the maker.
