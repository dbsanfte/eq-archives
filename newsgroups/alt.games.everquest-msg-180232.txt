I'm in a family and friends type guild, not an uber raiding guild.  I'm glad
you are happy in the type of guild you are in, I am too.  Being a relaxed
type of guild, people don't generally get upset if someone decides to sit
out a raid.  Sometimes I just want to go off somewhere and kill things, and
not deal with other people.
