Just wanted to say thanks. Initially, all I was looking for was a sort
of "Black Panther is better because of the secret stat xxx" or "BP
sucks, get a set of Acrylia".  But with that much speciific information,
shopping should be a breeze. In fact, I need to do it this morning.
We're going to take a bunch of baby alts and go try to bust up Paw. :-)
