screw feign death, but I do want the pet.  Think of it -- they're cleric
pets, right?  So if I'm ever hurt by a mob, the pet should:
1. root the offending mob
2. cast greater heal on me
3. go back to pounding and stunning the mob

Note:  pet should also get evac incase things go wonky; frex two of the
tanks have bit the dust and you're oom.  "/pet get us out"
