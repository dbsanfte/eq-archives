I'm going for the weirdly eclectic award, if that's okay?

Nickelback, Rob D, Animals, Poe, Robbie Williams, Alannah Myles, 
Propellerheads, Corrs, Bomb the Bass, Limp Bizkit, Apollo 440, Shakira, 
Savage Garden, a LOT of movie soundtracks (especially Hans Zimmer), and 
Adagio for Strings by Samuel Barber (Angus Dei choral version - as heard on 
Homeworld intro & very good for 'scenery' moments!)

Make of that lot what you will...  :o)
