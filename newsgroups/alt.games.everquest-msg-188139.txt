From the shadows, the mysterious georg <thegeorg@stny.rr.com> (if that
IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

Oh he aggroed me all right. I wasn't even controlling Lori at the
time, hard to accidently hit him while on the other character.

He made the turn, crept closer, then went ape. Lori was sitting (right
at the water's edge) so he hit her first, then necro nukes to
Harebell, two of them dropped her to low health frenzy aggro, so Lori
couldn't taunt before Harebell was dead. I ran Lori away when it was
clear I wasn't going to win that fight with no healing.

I was perturbed. I had earlier demonstrated to myself I could split
the first two elementals (though the ongoing snare saga on Test meant
the second one ran away and I had to evac), I was hoping to get into a
groove and start smashing when I came back. Only to have this guy go
nuts on me just as I started buffing up.
