You can ask...though you'll likely be ignored here as well.  Your best bet
is to turn on the new UI, go to bazaar & do a search (/baz command) for the
item you want to buy/sell.  If it's not available to sell and YOU have one
you want to sell, guess how much you think it's worth, and use the /trad
command to try to sell it for you, and go out to the movies, dinner, sleep,
whatever for as long as you can.
