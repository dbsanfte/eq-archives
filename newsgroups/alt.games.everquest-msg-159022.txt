 IF we go through invis, where do we set up camp to break the ballroom?

Go in through the main door and set up camp in the entryway against the wall
facing the stairs.  Pull and slay the two gargoyles by the stairs and the
one mob at the top of the stairs.  If you have SoW, keep that up at all
times.  Try to harmony pull the ballroom and have a good time.
