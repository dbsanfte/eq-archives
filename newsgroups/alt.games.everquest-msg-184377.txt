Why would you go from Athlon to Pentium? /retch

Anywho..  I have an AthlonXP 2000+ with WinXP pro edition. I zone under
30 seconds most of the time (unless zoning in to the bazaar). Either
something is wrong on your system, or you are simply suffering from the
old "pentiums really can't keep up" syndrome.

Then again, I also have 768mb of RAM and a GeForce4 Ti4600 with 128MB
RAM on it. Try turning on your caching option in the EQ options and see
if it helps any.
