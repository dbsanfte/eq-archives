On Tunare at least, the Nexus portal and big bank are the two MGB spots in
general.  Anytime someone's doing an MGB, someone will be doing rods.  I
like that as both my Enchanter and my Druid, it comes in handy.

I was just more wondering why people would bother doing it in the Bazaar
anywhere other than the bank or entry area, since they'd go to waste on
vendors.
