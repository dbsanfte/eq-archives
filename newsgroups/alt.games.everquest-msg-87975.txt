It's Kael Giants vs Thurgadin Dwarves... with Skyshrine Dragons trying to
eat both of the other 2 groups.
Siding with 1 of these 3 against the other 2 will raise your faction to a
point where you can start the class-armour quest with that faction.
The quests are, in ascending order of difficulty... but the harder the
quest, the better the armour (usually... but often by only the odd point of
AC or +stat)

Thurgadin
Kael
Skyshrine

Check Allakhazams.com for a full list of what's required for each armour
piece ( generally the format is... kill 'A' for a piece of unwearable
armour, kill 'B' for a gem, take both parts to 'C' to get your reward)

It's pretty cookie-cutter type questing... almost identical in format to the
Crafted/Ivy Etched/Totemic/Etc quests. The only real difference is once you
start on one of the paths, it makes it harder to go back and try a new path
if you want the better quality stuff... but faction can be worked on, and
most (if not ALL of the gems are traded in EC/GFay for cash).
