One of the reasons for that dynamic in FF was the gap between Asian and 
non-Asian players. The Japanese had a year headstart on Americans and 
Europeans in the game and by the time it was offered in the West the 
division was destined to be even greater. Most of my gaming friends who 
tried this game mentioned to me that they had a fine time as long as they 
didn't try to speak to other players. Wow, I thought, what's the point of 
that.

Yeah, you can disengage by explicitly doing a /yell for help *or* by running 
far and long enough that the game concludes that you're disengaging. At that 
point the lock breaks and anyone can help.

This is another key feature of EQ2 that is unlike EQ or many other MMOGS: 
you can outrun anything. I don't know if this will hold up post level 20 (20 
is the highest level I attained and on the server where I made 20, the 
highest level at the time was 32), but it's certainly true for 1-20. There's 
a built-in Sprint command that everyone gets that you can turn on in 
emergencies and it will drain Power but run you very, very fast. You hit 
Sprint and jam, and you'll almost always escape with your life. But don't 
aggro something else because once you're out of Power, no Spells, no Combat 
Arts, no nothing.

Yeah, that's the downside to this solution and it does suck. I hate not 
being able to engage to help and heal someone else outside of my group. I 
can rez them, but I can't help them until they're dead. But then I hate kill 
stealing too, so it's a tradeoff. It might not be the only solution 
imaginable and there could be others that no one has yet tried, but it 
definitely is a solution and it works well enough that players spend most of 
their time hunting and less time /shouting about kill stealing.

Yea, that would be a better approach but it's not as economically feasible 
for the MMOG developer so it's not likely to be the first solution they try.

In EQ2 you usually get new goodies every level, and they are automatic. That 
reminds me. As a member of both your archetype and your class, you can get 
new spells and abilities for each. For example, let's say you start off as a 
Priest and when you hit level 10 you decide to become a Shaman. At level 11 
all Priests get get a new Archetype ability called Favor of the Phoenix (a 
spell that allows you to summon a feather that can be given to another 
player and used to rez any priest, thus solving the priest rez problem). But 
as a Shaman at 11 you will also get Contagion, the first Shaman DoT.
