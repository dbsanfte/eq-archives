     Gameplay in, say, Horizons is much different than it is in DAoC. 
AO is very different than EQ. In the old days, UO and EQ were VERY
different games. They all have the same basic concepts because they
are MMORPGs, but if you expand the group to include MMOFPSs and 
MMOSGs the field varies greatly.
