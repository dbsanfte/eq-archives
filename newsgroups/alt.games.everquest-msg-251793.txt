I am not going to try to figure out what is best for a cleric but check out
this site:

There are a lot of FT augs but the type 7's are expensive so you probably
will want to first buy ldon equipment with type 3 slots to put them in.  I
advise not wasting points on cheap stuff.  Wait till you have the points to
buy what you want.  Tak vs Mir armor is the exception to that rule.  Think
carefully about whether the tak is worth the extra 732 points.
