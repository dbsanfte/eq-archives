Playing a ranger I have found that most people perceive them as a druid-
mentality tree-hugging sort of class.  Now, I knew that in the "classic 
sense" rangers are more of a good-natured hunter familiar with the woods 
and respecting it.  The reason rangers have tracking skill is so they can 
efficiently "hunt the big game".
