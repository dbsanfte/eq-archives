Here is my understanding.

First off, as a rogue, your goal is to not get the aggro, you want to be
behind the mob, maximizing your damage output.

STR has a marginal effect on overall damage output, and is useful for
lugging lots of stuff around.  It also has an effect on your backstab
damage, not sure how much.

AGI affects your AC, if it's below 75, then get it at least that high.

DEX affects how often procs occur, and, I understand that it affects your
backstab as well, but I don't know the details there.  Unless you get
massive amounts of DEX increase, the difference in Procs is marginal.  It
also affects the rate of skill increases in some skills.

STA affects your hitpoints directly.  Also, if your STA is below 100, then
when your stamina bar is empty, you slow down.  If your STA is above 100,
then you can ignore your stamina bar.

AC reduces the amount of damage your take when you get hit, may also reduce
your chance to get hit, not certain on that.

HP Well, we know what that's for, more is always better.

Most rogues I have talked to go for DEX and STR primarilly, assuming they
already have the 75+ AGI, and 100+ STA.  After that, whatever other stats
you can raise.  AC and HP are quite important, and probably have the highest
priority at that point.
