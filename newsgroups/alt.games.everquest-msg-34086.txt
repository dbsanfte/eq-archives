I'll definitely be there on day one... Exclusively? I'm not sure about
that... My druid will be level 35 by that time, and that's the point
when I plan to settle down and join a guild. If I find that the guilded
life is a lot more fun than soloing was, I'll probably scoot back and
forth between the two. If not, it will probably be RP all the way.
