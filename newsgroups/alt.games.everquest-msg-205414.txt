<snipped all the amazing math facts...>

Wait a second...  I thought I was following along but then you lost me...

Anytime I've ever come across the stupid casino people, I immediately /ignore
the shouter so I haven't really ever paid attention...  However...

You mean to say that what they do is take your 10 pp, and then, IF you roll
higher than whatever they say, they give you your 10 pp back?  If you don't you
lose...  

I guess I need to understand what the heck is the point???  I don't gamble... 
So maybe I'm at a disadvantage from the get go, but it seems to me that the
only reason to risk betting is the possibility of winning back MORE than you
stick into the pot...

There are actually morons out there who will toss 10 pp at someone for a 33
percent chance of getting their 10 pp back?
