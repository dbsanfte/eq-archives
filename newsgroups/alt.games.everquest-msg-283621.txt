Nice write-up Lance.  I haven't done the Dain mission yet, so that was
useful info indeed.

As you rightly say, the "paper tiger" thing can get horrendous.  In
the heyday of the MM's, which was in the first month or two of the
expansion's release, I got my Cleric up about 27 levels in two days,
from the teen-levels up to being able to cast Temp!!  I couldn't cast
a damned thing, heh...  Took me days of grinding my spell- and
combat-skills non-stop to get them up to par  :)

The missions are very good for getting AA points though - I have a
friend who now has a druid with 600 AA points. He'll take some
catching up to on my part!
