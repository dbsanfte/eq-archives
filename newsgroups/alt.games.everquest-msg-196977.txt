What about guilds like my former guild that are "family" guilds and
can't muster the kind of groups necessary to flag?  What happened in
ours was that, people who wanted to go to the tier 2 planes left our
guild for other guilds - and we were never able to progress as a guild
to the point where we could do it ourselves, as the very people we
needed were leaving.  Eventually the guild disbanded because of the
general feeling of being forever stuck in one spot.

Well, personally I think the fact they've been in the tier 2/3
planes with their better xp and drops is a pretty good reward - but
if you simply throw these planes open to all, it is kind of a kick
in the face to folks who did it the hard way.  Also, if you take out
the need to flag for PoS/PoV - what incentive is there to do the
trials?  Already we see most of them ignored for the "easy" trial.
I'd think a reward for flags from those trials would be a substitute
for the actual ability to go somewhere new.

I'm not sure if I approve of this change or not - I'm decidely on
the fence.  I do like the idea of being able to get xp from lower
level mobs again - I've stayed 61 in order to be able to solo xp
still when I don't have the time to LFG.
