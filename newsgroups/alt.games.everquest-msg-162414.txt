Myabe I've been playing this completely wrong... but I really don't think
you should have 100 practice points... you should use them as soon as you
get them b/c the higher you're trained in a skill, the faster you learn it
with practice.  If you wait to use them, you're losing a lot of points you
could put into your skills through practice.  I'd suggest putting those
practices into the skills you use most right now, not waiting for some more
opportune time to use them.
