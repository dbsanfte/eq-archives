No I mean people chatting and making deals via the chat and trade groups. I 
have found more friends via the crafting channels than I have found 
adventuring.

Sya what you like I believe this was simply down to the interdependency 
where you get to know people and what class they are etc. I have crafted 
items for people many times for free, simply because they have helped me out 
at some point and havent ripped me off when it came time to trade.
