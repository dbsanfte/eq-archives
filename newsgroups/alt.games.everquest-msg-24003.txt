Perhaps I misunderstood...

I was under the impression that your comment:

>So thats why there are over 1k people playing them every day?

was intended to dispute the statement:

>PvP servers were only added because of a vocal minority's griping

Hence my affirmation that the number of players on the PvP servers
was, indeed, a minority in comparison to the player base as a whole.

Now, was I incorrect in my impression? Because I certainly can't
figure out how I might have misinterpreted your comment.

Or, was I correct in my impression? If that's the case, shall I take
your "No sh!t" response as the full sum of your debate skills, or do
you actually have an argument to present?
