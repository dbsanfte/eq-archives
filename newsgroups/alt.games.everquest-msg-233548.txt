Not in my experience.  I group completely interchangably with druids or 
clerics for xp grouping and LDoN.  On raids, there are very few mobs that 
we hit where we don't use druids interchangably with clerics as well.  I 
will agree that it is a lot less often that you see a shaman step in for 
a cleric, but druids are largely considered interchangable with them, at 
least among the people I play with.
