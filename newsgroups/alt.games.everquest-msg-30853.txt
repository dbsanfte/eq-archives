This has always been a pet peeve of mine.
One thing I never could understand is why so many people that teleport have
to play the 20-questions game. If a guy wants a port, why not just give it
to him without a bunch questions or some silly argument? Offering advice is
one thing, being an overbearing annoyance is another.

I mean, Sheesh!  First you tell this guy that he shouldn't be going to
Everfrost  (which IS within his level, btw), and you start telling him he
shouldn't solo (which a warrior CAN do at that level). Then you start
telling him where he *should*  be hunting. Cripes, the poor bastard is just
trying to get to Everfrost and he has to put up with a stupid argument from
some pushy prick.  To top it off, you start telling him to play a different
class, when you obviously don't know what the hell you are talking about in
the first place. I'm sure the guy needed your shit about as much as he
needed a hole in his head.

>He then tells me "Thanx for ruining my expectations", and dont answer when
i try
to talk to him again.<

WTF do you expect? The guy simply wanted a port and you kept pushing your
crap on him when you should have either ported him, or let him be.
Did it ever occur to you that the poor bastard obviously wanted to see
everfrost and apparently was pretty excited about it? Hell yeah, you ruined
his expectations.
He had more patience than I would have. I would have ceased dealing with you
long before the warrior did.
