Spectres in oasis are excellent for quadding, but you might find 8 spawns
are too few with kei. These guys are SLOW and drop decent loot.
Spirocs in TD might be better if you have kei. Faster, tougher and loot
sucks.

Wyverns in CS are good quadding too, but you would need kei and good wisdom
to do these. Also you need COV faction to make hunting here possible (kill
giants in kael)
Burning wood is decent too... setup camp just south of slixen klex on the
flat (mobs dont path here), and pull mobs from the east. Skeletons, hornets,
gorillas, sarnaks all move at the same speed, and all but the sarnaks will
chase you no mater how damaged they are.
