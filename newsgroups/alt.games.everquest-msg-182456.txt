It's not a bug. It's by design. It is that way for any song that only 
provides an effect when it pulses, I believe. In other words, as soon as 
you stop this song and attempt to twist another one in, it ceases to play 
altogether. There are no residual pulses from it.

CoD has been the downfall of most bards at one time or another - myself 
included.  :)
