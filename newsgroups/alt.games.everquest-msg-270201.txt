When I browse my recipe book and examine e.g. "Essence of Toughness
(Apprentice III)", the "Produces" section at the bottom says "Toughness
(Apprentice II)". Note: II, not III.

Is this a bug/typo, or is there a perfectly good explanation for it?

Yesterday, I visited a PC shop and the owner there thought he had a "Forced
Swing (Apprentice III)" for sale and was genuinely surprised (I believe)
when I made him aware of it. Presumably, he ran into the same trap.
