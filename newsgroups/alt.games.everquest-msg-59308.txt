   I don't ever have any money, usually, being a
tradeskill junkie and all.  But when I do want
to buy something, I don't want to spend alot of 
time haggling and doing /ooc PC on Whatever.
If someone doesn't have an idea of what to sell
for, I just send tell them "Nevermind.  If you
don't know, just forget it."  This way, they know
they're losing a potential buyer due to their 
ignorance.
    It is pretty funny, though, when someone 
/auctions the wrong price.  On Drinal, the
usual price in Freeport for a Walrus tooth 
is 25pp.  I've seen them go for 30, and managed
to buy one for 10.  Not so long ago, I was 
around when someone was repeatedly spamming 
that they had one for 50pp.  For quite a 
long while.  While other people were 
auctioning more reasonable prices.  I 
couldn't help but shake my head at that.
I mean, we're talking about what is basically
a nice newbie weapon, and a low end one at 
that.  Why even bother to jack up the price
on that one?

Annie  <--- Didn't /ooc telling him the error
            of his ways, because she finds that
            to be annoying also.
