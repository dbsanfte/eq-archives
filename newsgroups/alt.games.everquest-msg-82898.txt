There's a lvl 7 enchanter on Terris-Thule named Tonibraxton.  I asked the
person about it and they said I was the first person to ever say anything to
them about it.  Seen a low level ranger named Reconmarine too.  I seem to be
seeing more and more border line names out and about.  I'm sure they get
100's of reports a day on names and can't keep up.

Just my thoughts
