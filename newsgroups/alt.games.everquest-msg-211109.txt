Indeed, it seems there's a graphic problem with cloth caps. It doesn't
appear when you have the newer models turned on. I have old world
graphics for all characters and the glitch appears on my newbie
half-elf druid and erudite paladin, both sporting cloth caps. I got
confirmation from another player using all Luclin models turned on
that he doesn't see the glitch. I've already /bug'ed it, but since it
doesn't affect gameplay at all, who knows if/when it will get fixed.
