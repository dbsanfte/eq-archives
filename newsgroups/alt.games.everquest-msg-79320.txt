I agree entirely.

The only thing I wanted to clear up was the blanket implication
that I didn't care about stopping exploiters, and/or
was griping at Verant for the mere act of trying to stop
them.  I do, and I wasn't.

I was just saying that IMNSHO they've
got better ways to spend their Guide resources than
doing the equivalent of assigning police in parks to
watch for violators of the "keep of the grass" signs,
when they could at the very least be watching over
convenience stores in high-robbery areas.
