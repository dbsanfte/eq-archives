I'll have to give TS a try, always looking for a better mousetrap :)

I'm also interested that you found yahoo to be inferior to rw. 
What sort of issues did you have? I rarely push it beyond 3 people,
and you mention 5-8... that could be a factor. RW sounded worse, but
that probably means lower bandwidth... which would scale up to more
people better.
