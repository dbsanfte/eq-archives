Just to chime in, I agree that it would be nice to see a specific message 
on login attempt stating that the patch was still in progress, but I really 
don't think it would accomplish much. As biz said, you're already aware 
there is a patch in play, so it's a pretty safe assumption as to why you're 
still unable to log in.

That said, it *would* be nice to see any sort of status message on the 
actual download screen as opposed to making me go far enough through the 
process to actually attempt logging in.
