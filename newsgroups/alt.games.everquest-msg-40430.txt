It would be easier to get your Iksar monk to Overthere, park him on the
beach away from the Outpost, and just have your enchanter take the boat
in Oasis and jump off and swim to the beach before it docks.

You may want to do the transfer underwater, in case there are players
around... Many people pull mobs to the beach.
