Magical weapons are VERY easy to buy. Stuff like all sorts of Velium weapons
that drop off every other dwarf or giant in Velious, Axe of the Iron Back, 
Tentacle Whip, Screaming Mace, Runed Totem Staff, Glowing Wooden Crook.. 
all sold for 10-50 pp.

That's 1 or 2 high quality bear pelts (sold for 30-35 pp) you can hunt black
bears or polar bear cubs for. 

When I started out, I bought a Stone Thunder (9 36 1hb) for 80 pp at level 12.
Prices have definitely gone down from then, so it's ridiculous that a person
doesn't have a magical weapon at level 22.
