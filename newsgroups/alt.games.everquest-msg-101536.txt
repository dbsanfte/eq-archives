Hmm I have a level 5 chanter I just started a couple days ago on
druzzil. I spent about 3 total hours becoming a master baker and then
about 4 hours making a total of about 100pp. I think I would have
rather paid someone  even verant for a starter sum of plat.

And I don't care if I offend anyone, their mothers, sisters, dogs or
cats for that matter :)

Its just a game, play it how you want to I don't give a crap.
