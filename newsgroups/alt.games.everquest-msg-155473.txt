I dunno.  I like playing with just a couple of close friends myself.
I can't remember the last time I played in a group of six where ALL of them
were really AT the keyboard at once.  It really ticks me off when someone runs
over, joins the group, and 10 minutes later goes AFK for 20 minutes.  Or worse
has to go help a guildie or friend but wants you to keep them in the group. 
What's with that?  And then there's the guy who doesn't want to loot anything
except the Dark Ember if it drops.  Or tells you he's been pulling Ry`Gorrs for
ages then pulls the whole fort ????  
And when I do join a full group I expect there to be chatter.  If everyone
wants to just play in silence why aren't they soloing?  
At any rate, I'm glad to see that I have misunderstood the meaning of "group".
