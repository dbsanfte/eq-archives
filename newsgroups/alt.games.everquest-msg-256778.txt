I guess my answer was too broad. Basically whatever skill you have at
start can increase even at 0. Since hybrids don't pickup spellcasting
till level 9, they need to train in that but they dont start at 0, the
skill begins at 9. The same with any other skill that requires
training because they are attained after level 1.
