Yup.  Not a knock on DL (the Chronicles are one of my favorites), but the
series is an easier read than LotR.  *Definitely* less taxing on the brains
of Generation PSX.

But when the 'Fellowship' movie comes out ... Katie bar the door.

Y'know, the abridged version of 'The Hobbit' was required reading my 6th
grade year (hmmm ... that would've been 1974-ish).  I wonder if it still is?

Most likely not.

</em begins digging through the bookshelf ... ahhh, there they are.>

"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole,
filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy
hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and
that means comfort."

Hello, my old friend.  It's been a while.
