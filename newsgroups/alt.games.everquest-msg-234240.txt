I don't have time to read the eqnecro thread now, but how's this going to
work?  The Castersrealm interview led me to believe that leadership xp is
completely different from regular xp, i.e. earning leadership xp doesn't eat
into regular xp.  Meanwhile, a post early in the necro thread says it takes
20% of your regular xp.  Is the info contradictory or am I just up too late?

I like the abilities that might come with this leadership xp, but I can't
say that I'm excited about the strife I see it creating in pickup groups.  I
have a regular group, so, assuming that the trick to having the opportunity
to earn leadership points is being the group leader, we can just rotate and
let people earn leadership xp - which could go to show that there is a
distinction between being the Group Leader and leading the group.  What if
one person puts a group together, but another player is the take charge
character?
