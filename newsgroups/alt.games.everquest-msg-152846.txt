A guy at monklybusiness were qellios monk (isnt that the deity), take a 
LOT more work than a agnostic one, took him a little over 12000 bonechips.

You cant get unkos to Cazik, youll have to sneak behind him, talk to him 
to get book, and do the handins, and hope like hell that:
A. no mob aggro you, aggro near CT = DT from CT (same as for ikky monks, 
we kos to rest of fear too).
B. That CT dont turn around while youre doing it, cause hell DT you on 
sight.
