I'm not going to say I care about some child that managed to kill himself by
some toy. However, I'm also not going to say I celebrated his demise. It's
called indifference - it doesn't matter to me if they lived or died.

I will maintain my opinion that the child was stupid. I also will maintain
the opinion that changing a toy to nurture the stupidity of a few select
people's safety -rather- than having some parents change their negligent
ways is rediculous.

The old See and Say kicked ass... back in the day, you pulled a string and
that caused the arrow to spin. Now you just press the button near the animal
(or whatever it's themed towards) and it plays the message.

Did you ever have one? Did you ever kill yourself with it? Obviously not.
Was it because they rounded off the corners and made it impossible to
strangle yourself with? No... it was because you were smart enough not to
yourself with it and/or your parents watched you.

Hooray... you passed one of life's little hazards.
