Ported out when they reach the top of the agro list (or something to that
effect anyway)
So when he ports you, simply gate/CoH back

Cheating?  Shrug.. no different to my cleric or shaman (65) healing my level
1 twink while he kills a red-as-hell mob.

People wouldn't kill Vox to the extent they now do, if VI didn't make rez
sticks for millions of plat to recharge (4million pp, or farm a gimpy
dragon? hmmm i wonder).

A total lose lose situation IMO...  my guild and I had NP paying low level
guilds 70-100kpp for a rez stick (on their own vox raid), which meant
small_guild got a) their dragon raid  b) their dragon loot c) a LOT of money

Now though, with recharging pretty much impossible, if we want Vox sticks,
we have no choice but to go killhim ourselves, repeatedly.

Im not particularly thrilled when my guild kills Vox with 3 people and the
loot is rotting/sold/FFA, but I don't really see any other option we have.

So if we decide to kill him, he's dead around noon PST; way before any guild
"at the level" can get a raid together.

Ah well, gives the bored early raiders something to do
