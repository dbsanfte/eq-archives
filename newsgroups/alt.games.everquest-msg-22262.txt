And if the only merchant in the area sells absolutely nothing you really
need, (been there, done that) you can still change it all in for something
better than just throwing it away.  I usually look for something cheap
that will cost less than the total value of all my copper, silver, and
gold combined. (but not too much less). Or even a stack of cheap items
that will meet that total without exceeding it. Then I buy it/them. Then I
sell it back. The merchants will pay you in the largest coin possible.
This way you get rid of all the heavy coin, and still get *something* back
in terms of money, though only at the crappy buyback prices of the
merchants, of course.
