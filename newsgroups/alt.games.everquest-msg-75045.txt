Yeah, but it gives pulling necros a second feign death before the recycle 
time of their spell.  Feign death takes 1.5 seconds to cast, but has a 2.2 
recycle time.  Being able to immediately cast another version of feign 
death is basically a get-out-of-death-free card, at least according to my 
guildleader (crazy pulling necro).
