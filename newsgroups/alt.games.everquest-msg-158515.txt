What if the reasons that they committed suicide
were plainly linked to a reason other than Eq?

The whole thing is fallacious reasoning, based on
faulty premises.

I think it is totally without merit.

Think about it.

Everquest has been running for around 4 years.
What you are saying is that only ONE Eq player
(Shawn Woolley), has ever committted suicide, in
all that time.

To disprove this odd theory of yours, all it takes
is to find ONE Eq player who committed suicide in
the last four years, apart from Shawn Woolley.

The rate of youth (16-24) suicide for 1997 was
around 11 per 100,000, about the same as the
nation as a whole. In four years of Eq, therefore,
we would expect to see around around 180 suicides,
if the suicide rate amongst Eq players were the
same.

What you and David are suggesting is not only that
the suicide rate is lower than the non-Eq playing
population, (not too far-fetched), but that it is
not 10 times lower, nor even 100 times lower, but
180 times lower (very far-fetched).
