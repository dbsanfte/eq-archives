I'm not exactly an established member of the EQ community, but I hope
I can offer a useful viewpoint regardless.

You need to do what you can to ensure you can look at yourself in the
mirror and be happy (or at least not UNhappy) with what you see.

The GL blowup obviously means something to you, since you posted about
it.  I'd at least make it clear that you feel it was inappropriate
behavior, and somewhat uncalled for.

Problem members are a bit more touchy.  If they aren't in clear-cut
violation of Guild policies and/or expectations, it becomes a gray
area.  What one person finds inexcusable, others will live with -- and
the points made earlier about self-benefit -- absolutely true.  People
can overlook a LOT for close friends, or someone who benefits them
directly.

It's very hard to walk away from something you worked so hard on, and
it sounds like you are generally happy with the Guild and server, only
with a few small instances.

Ultimately, you need to make the decision that allows you to retain
the most personal dignity and integrity as you see it.  In your shoes,
I'd probably tough it out a while longer unless the behaviors
continued, but I'm also very much a follower, not a leader, for what
that's worth.

Take it and run.
