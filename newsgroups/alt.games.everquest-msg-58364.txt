What effect does "haste" have on what? My char has never had a haste
item, but one may be available to him shortly. What all does it
effect? Weapon speed? Other?

In an example my char has one weapon that  is 9/22 or a ratio of 2.44
| 22/9 = 2.44  |   If I equip a belt tht has 16 % haste will that
change the weapon to a 9/18.48 or a ratio of 2.053    |  22-16% =
18.44 and 18.44/9 = 2.053.

Or if not that then what?
