A successful stun, no matter how short, will always interrupt a spell being
cast.  It may not be great at level  9, but it'll be huge later on.   Having
a mob cast gate successfully (and then come back with friends) can often
mean a full party wipe for your group.  And cleric mobs are downright
painful if you don't have someone along able to stun them.  You end up
having to kill them four or five times, because every time they get down to
20 percent life, they cast complete heal and go back to full.

As someone else mentioned, mobs hate being stunned.   Casting stuns on
things is much more aggro than taunting, and doesn't fail the same way.
