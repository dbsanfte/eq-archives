    And regarding the Meatball...

    I also posted this story on the FV community board, and a guild officer
called me on the missing "L".  I defended myself using the conversation on the
topic that you and Graeme were having.

    Just curious David, are you a native Spanish speaker?  Because when I posted
this point of yours, I sorta implied that you were.  And if you're not, would
you lie and say you are if any of my guild officers contact you?  /snicker

   Regardless, The Meatball is not getting a name change.  He _is_ a native
Spanish speaker, the family we stole him from were our Mexican neighbors when we
lived in San Diego, and he's next corrected my pronunciation.
