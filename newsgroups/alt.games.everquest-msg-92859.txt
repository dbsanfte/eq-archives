Well my 7th level half elf ranger is doing pretty well hunting around the
hills of Qeynos, and even descending into the dreaded (but highly
entertaining ) Gnoll caves.

I have around 20 training points saved up, just wanted some opinions on
where I should be eyeing on spending them? I was aiming to be an archer, but
oh boy is arrow making tedious...

Thanks

Heroic tales of Gnoll hunting would be appreciated as well, those caves are
a lot of fun..if slighly nerve wracking :)

Pete
