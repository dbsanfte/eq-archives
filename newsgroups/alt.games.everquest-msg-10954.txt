Now, nothing to do with the initial question, but you and your partner have GOT
to get to Kedge Keep - I stumbled onto this excellent place with my mage at
39th, and all I can say is WOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOW!!!!!

Made all of 39 in 6 hours solo in the entryway.  Looking at getting through 40
in about 12 hours or so over this weekend.  Xp rocks, no loot to speak of, but
did I mention, XP ROCKS!!! :)  I'm almost always the only one in there too.
Pulling is a bit tricky, but not bad after you get used to the area.  Avoid the
impaler swordfish though, at this level.  He's a meanie.

With a partner (grouped with a ranger for about an hour) it's just too much.
This place was made for mages ~35+ (and people say Verant doesn't like us! ;)

..of course I'm mad...
Spiders?  What spiders?
