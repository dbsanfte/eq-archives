   The mage seemed to be acting in a petty, immature way.  The gender of the
toon happened to be female, so Richard is using the feminine pronouns.  I think
it is far more telling that you assume that the adjectives being used are more
appropriate for a woman than a man.

   For what it's worth, I cannot recall Richard ever using any profanity in any
of his posts.  If he has a grievance with someone, he expresses without
resorting to swear words.  Also, again for what it's worth, I am a real woman,
and most of the people around here seems to believe that.  I did not find any
sexist context in Richard's language at all.
