Hello

Fighting Baton 100pp to 200pp (dont pay more)
Bo Stick 40pp to 80pp (good cheap weapon for training)
Adamantite Bo Stick varies more but i wouldnt pay more than 350pp. For me,
its not a very good weapon.

Those weapons are very easy to get in Dalnir with a group of low 30 or solo
when you are level 40 (or a little less if you have a good equipment). I
sold a few of them. Personnaly, the prices i sell them now are 200pp for
Fighting Baton, 250pp for Adamantite Bo Stick and 60pp for Bo Stick. Of
course, i can sell them a little lower if the person interested in buying
them discuss my prices but i wouldnt sell the FB or the ABS for 100pp (i
think its insulting).

I am on Lanys T'Vyl

PS: english is not my native language
