Eq is becoming more and more full of right-click items.  I'm starting to
build up my collection of them.  But it's becoming increasingly difficult
to explain some of them in roleplaying terms.  

See this to get what I
mean:  http://www.gucomics.com/archives/view.php?cdate=20030623

Ok, my pegasus feathered cloak makes sense...I figure I wrap I twirl it
around my shoulders or some such.

eyepatch of plunder - ok, a little weird, but maybe I emit a convincing
piratical ARRR MATE!

but now it's starting to get weird

My ornate chain pants are going to have right-click root.   Tis one
quickly become hilarious.

/em sits on %t. "%t is rooted, move back!"

or even better

/em rubs her ass and %t is rooted in fascination.

Anyone have any particularly funny explanations for their right-click gear
they want to shre? I always liked the "summoning water from my
boots" trick...I do not want to know what that "water" is really composed
of.
