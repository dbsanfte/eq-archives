You do have to have at least one point in each specialization before any 
one of them will go over 50. 

You might have missed one, go look again.  Then try this; put one point 
into evocation.  Unless you've failed to put one point into specialize 
Alteration, Abjuration, Conjuration -and- Divination, there's no reason 
specialize Evocation shouldn't raise on that basis.

The cap for your level for the skill is either 150 or 155, even at 20 it 
was either 100 or 105, and the trainer will have no qualms at all about 
letting you spend those precious points and hard earned cash (higher 
level skills start to cost money) getting all the way to cap if you like.

Hmm, there is one other reason you might be having trouble, although it 
seems very unlikely.  If one of the other four specializations is above 
50, then you won't be able to raise the one you like until you do the 
ruby quest to erase this error.  But if you put Evoc to 50 and all 
others at 1, then the odds of you raising one of the others to 51 
without getting even one single Spec Evoc skill raise are very low

What on earth would prompt you to raise the skill to 50 spending points 
when you know it has to be at 51 to be safe, anyway?  I mean, if you 
were at 45 and spent the only 5 points you had on it that would be one 
thing.  But at 0 to 50... we are only talking 2% more effort to actually 
nail it down!  Then you compound this by going 10 levels without fixing 
the problem, hard to imagine.  Specialization maxed out means a 10% 
reduction in your cost in that line, thats like a 20% increase in mana 
regeneration, what would you give for a constantly on C5 (if you could 
even get C5 at your level... and hey, this stacks with that, and mana 
preservation and ID.....).  Even getting the other specializations up to 
50 instead of down at 1 or 0 is nice, a 2.5% boost which is like a 5% 
increase in mana regen for your other spells.

ps so I'm wrong, you buy spec at 1 point gets you 20 skill, then spend 
30 more getting to 50, slightly over 3% more effort, not a mere 2%.  And 
you can't have the other specs at 1, although 0 is a possibility, the 
next step is 20 for a caster, 30 for a healer.
