Bard damage output can be raised with both equipment (better mod) and AA
(instrument mastery). Just about any class is limited in damage output by
their equipment and AA, and bards aren't even a DPS class, so who cares?

A warrior can have 0 spells memmed, but can still benefit from full
buffs. So can a bard. What's your point?

Instruments. AA. New songs. What was your complaint again? Chanter
spells are almost exactly like they used to be too, they do mana regen,
they haste, they slow, they mez and they charm. Same thing as they did
at level 24 five expansions ago. Same thing with any class.

I see bards being very popular in groups, more so now than a year ago,
still immensely good soloers, still useful, nay needed in the raiding
guild.

Sure, we're not given that much new utility, we get the same gradual
upgrades as other classes. But we don't need it to be balanced.
