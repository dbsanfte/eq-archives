 My point was that most people take what's available. If you need a
healer and a druid is LFG you'll probably grab the Druid. If a cleric is
LFG you'll grab that person. In the perfect world you'd have the
perfectly balanced group. As we've all seen, EQ isn't a perfect world.
The most successful groups are those that take any class and make it
work rather than waiting around for a specific class.
