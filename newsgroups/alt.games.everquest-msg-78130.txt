I agree with you.  Helping the true Newbies is what makes the game even more
enjoyable for me.  And of course, most CR's are done in Blackburrow for my
lvl 25, as well as my Boyfriend's lvl 23, but we do it without a second
thought and with no notion of receiving payment for it.  If more people
would help the new players and show them kindness, then perhaps there
wouldn't be so many jaded people out there...
