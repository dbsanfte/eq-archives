Doesn't matter.  It's a violation of the rules.  You are always arguing 
that they need to enforce the rules completely, yet here you're saying 
they don't need to.  DT, you are a hypocrite, and it's wearing thin.  
Admit that you're an overbearing ass, and move on with your life.  (I 
generally like your posts, but on this issue, and several other similar 
issues, you are a complete ass, and need to be called on it.)  
There is NOTHING in that rule to indicate that there is ANY obscurity 
test.  It plainly states that Copyrighted or trademarked names are a 
violation of the rules.  It's black and white, and you really need to get 
on the GMs to ban Lokari.  
(Lokari, this is not directed at you, and I would do anything I could to 
help if you ran across some GM who actually hassled you on this.)
