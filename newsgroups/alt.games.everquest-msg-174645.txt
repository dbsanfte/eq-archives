This is the stickler, if you ask me. Naturally, everyone wants to
level up, including the people in their 60s. Your guild is not
responsible for PL'ing you, and I'm not sure I would be thrilled about
a player who requires it to be happy. Others completed the trial
without PL'ing, so can you.

Of course I used the term *you* here in the figurative sense.
