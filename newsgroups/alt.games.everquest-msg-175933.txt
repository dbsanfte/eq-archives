I want to start a shaman as a soloing class, but I have been told the shaman
doesn't start out very well in the soloing category.  *If* I was to find
someone to power level me, what do you think would be a fair price for this?
Is this kind of thing generally accepted by guides/gms as along as the PLer
and the PLee are not disturbing anyone else in the area?  Can a shaman solo
from 34th on? And finally, does anyone play on Eci that would consider doing
this?  I dont have alot of cash, but am not against hunting tailoring
supplies, or other mundane things like that in lieu of the cash value.

PS - Am really just after info on this subject, have not made up my mind
yet.
