Biz, I agree with you .... to a point.

It's kind of like saying "How did folks get from Point A to Point B before
cars?".  They walked, but if you're the only one in your group without a
car, folks would get tired of waiting for you after a while.

It's the same way with KEI, unfortunately.  I've been in groups in Maiden's
Eye and Umbral Plains where I was the only one without KEI, and the rest of
the group was constantly waiting on me to reclaim mana.  They were sitting
on full waiting for me to get to 40% so that I'd say "Pull when ready ... I
can fight".

They're my guildies (and my friends) so they didn't say a thing about it ...
but they didn't really have to, either.  I knew I was holding them up.

You'll be hard pressed to find someone more adamant about KEI getting
bludgeoned with the ol' nerf bat than I am.  But Tim has a point.
