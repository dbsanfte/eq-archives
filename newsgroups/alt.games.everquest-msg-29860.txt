I'd say 7 is a minimum level, though a necro could probably get started at
level 6 as long as you stay near the entrance.

At level 6-7, you'll be fighting the spawns in the front hall and  the
runners that path past the entrance. As pointed out, the biggest problem
is not the level of the mobs. It's the runners who bring back their
buddies.

Here are some tips:

When soloing at low levels, pull to the entrance tunnel. The kobolds are
small enough that anyone exiting can just run through them and, if they're
aggro on you, they won't attack anyone zoning in (at least not
immediately). If things get hairy then just step backwards across the zone
line. If there are some other folks your level near the entrance then
group with them and you can work the hallway instead of confining your
work to the entrance. If you're brave, this is also a good strategy for
handling a train, whether it's yours or someone else's. Fight them in the
tunnel entrance and take one or two out before you zone (or get knocked
through the zone line by the battle). Just make sure it's a blue/black
train and not a red one or you won't get the chance to zone. *heh*

In the entrance hall, the kobolds who run when they get weak generally run
toward the big room full of kobolds if there is no other help nearby. Have
your group take advantage of this by pulling to the other end of the
hallway. That gives you the most opportunity to stop them before they get
their buddies to come whomp on you. (Point of trivia: Kobolds way deep in
the Warrens exhibit this exact same behavior. My theory is that they are
trying to run to the King to get help.)

Take a cry of "Train!" seriously. Either zone or make sure you have an
unobstructed path. There's always a level 10 who thinks he "ownz" the
hallway and starts exploring deeper, where he gets jumped by a mob of
yellows and has to sprint to the zone. There's only one way out of the
Warrens and you are going to be hunting there. Be prepared to run for your
life at a moment's notice. This will change somewhat with Stonebrunt
mountains, since that zoneline will potentially be a faster escape route
for some deeper portions of the Warrens.

Get to know the named kobolds. If you're hunting the entry hall and
someone comes running up with any named kobolds (Smithy, Foodmaster,
Prince, Jailor...) don't wait around to see if he shouts train. Either
zone out or get to the tunnel entrance and assess the situation where
you're just a step or two from the zone line.

Pitfighters hit hard even when they finally con green. :-P If they're
black or higher then don't try and solo them unless you have an escape
route handy. *heh*

Wear as much of the wicker armor as you can. You'll be stylin'! :-)
