Ok, 2 things. The guys who say I'm whining and spend all day posting about
it 20 times have far too much time on their hands... ever consider a hobby
guys? Maybe you could take up knitting eh?

Ok, now to the valid point this guy is talking about. People who are so
"down on Verant CS". I'm a 31 year old guy and I've been working with
computers since I was 14. I rarely have a problem I can't solve myself. I've
been playing EQ since there were 4 servers to choose from, and in that time
I've needed Tech Support twice. The first time they were helpful but it was
like pulling teeth. This last time I couldn't get help from them without
calling a long distance number which, if you ask me, is stupid for me to
have to do considering how much money they make on this game.

Sure, 800#s are a pain to support... but it's a small price to pay not to
lose 10-30% of your customer base.
