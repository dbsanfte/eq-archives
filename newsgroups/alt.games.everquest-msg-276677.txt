Maybe a single player RPG isn't but MMOGs sure are. And it's MMOGs that we
are discussing. A lot of them are player versus player and even the ones
that aren't have competition.

2 people want to join a group which has space for one. 1 has double the
firepower of the other. Either that person earned it (which is what players
of MMOGs expect) or he just bought it. The person with the firepower is
going to get the spot in most cases. Now, if the person earned it within the
game, that can be respected by the loser of the competition for the place.
But if they got it because Daddy slipped the gaming company a little 'tip'
then how do you think the loser's going to feel?

And what if the company makes it nigh impossible for someone who pays the
stated cost of the game to ever aquire that firepower?

I want to experience the game too. If we are playing the same PVP game,
should I be able to totally own you with my leet credit card skills?

Should someone be deceived into playing a game thinking they'll be able to
experience the content described on the game, only to find they need to make
additional 'micropayments' not mentioned on the box or the initial contract
in order to be competitive? I would have thought the local equivalent of
consumer affairs would have a few problems with that.
