Well, first off, drop one of the stuns.  You should either be capable of 
stun lockdown, or not; two stuns won't let you chain stun to keep a mob 
100% unable to do anything, and one stun is almost always enough if all 
you need it for is to stop a gate or Cheal from a mob as its about to 
die, or for other useful purposes such as halting a mob thats' beating 
on the chanter long enough for him to get it mezzed.

Further, there's a big difference between your level 5 spell, Stun, and 
(almost) all your other stuns; the level 5 version is worlds better. 
Its cheapest, fastest to cast, isn't AoE (more on this in a sec) and 
most important, does no damage.

Why is "does no damage" a good thing?

Well, none of your stuns do enough damage to be useful as nukes, really, 
and their mana to damage ratio sucks anyway.  Try taking down a single 
dark blue mob by doing nothing but standing and casting your heavy 
damage stuns at it till it dies... you'll run out of mana and your 
target will still be at 80% hp.

But there's more to it than this.  Stuns get a resist, damage spells get 
a resist, stuns with a damage component get Two resist checks, and if 
either fails then neither the stun nor the damage gets in.  So a stun 
with damage component is actually -less- likely to stun the target than 
your good old level 5 Stun.

But thats not all.  Doing damage means a chance to break root; every 
time you damage a rooted mob with a spell, it gets an extra check.  And 
damage ALWAYS breaks mez.  So if you are throwing out a stun in order to 
control a mob for  few seconds while someone else is attempting a more 
permanent CC spell, and they happen to get theirs landed before your 
stun lands, you can end up actually breaking the mez (or ghetto mez as 
Root is often referred to).  But your level 5 spell, Stun, will never 
break either sort of CC.

And, Stun has no knockback component.  Knockback on nukes is nice in 
some cases, as moving a mob often interrupts its casting.  But since 
landing any stun effect Always interrupts casting, this is a non issue. 
  Moving a mob around means messing up the melee damage output, risking 
more riposting, possibly even losing MT aggro altogether.  Its a rarely 
something you want to do, although its sometimes necessary to put up 
with it in order to deny spell casting to the mob.

Further, as a cleric, aggro control is an issue.  Stuns are admittedly a 
bit high on aggro to begin with, but the no damage stun (the cleric one 
that is, the paladin only ones seem to be a bit different) is the lowest 
of the lot, its the easiest one for melee to overcome.

Faster, cheaper, same stun duration, same 100% (assuming it sticks) 
effective casting interruption, sticks more often, doesn't screw up CC, 
gets you less aggro... the only reason to ever cast any other stun (at 
your level... there are a couple arguably better stuns for some 
situations at higher levels) is that all your stuns have a long cycle 
time, so casting your second tier stun if you need another interupt 
before Stun ungreys might be necessary, and casting your Third stun 
might be needed if both the others are grey.

You should know in advance, though, when those rare circumstances are 
likely where its going to be necessary to chain cast stuns like that, or 
to deliberately move mobs around via knockback.  Other than those 
situations, there's little reason to mem more than Stun, the jewel of 
the line.

Splendid
