Taunt definitely does not work this way. If it did, the MA would only ever
need to Taunt once to pull aggro. And aggro would switch to whoever was
second on the hate list much more easily than it actually does.

The way I think of it, the MOB has a certain amount of hate for each person
on their hate list. Taunt increases this amount; as does healing, debuffs,
buffs (to a lesser extent), melee/magic damage and certain other things
such as stuns and mez. Thus a warrior keeps mashing taunt to stay as high
on the hate list as possible and reduce the odds that somebody else will
wind up higher.

Having the warrior taunt twice wasn't working because of a chance of
failure; it was working because it would add twice as much hate.

As you say, there are other factors that affect aggro - notably sitting
aggro and, when rooted, proximity. But keeping hate up is key.

Anyway, as others have said - taunt as much as you can and you should be
much better at holding aggro. Or else the cleric will be very annoyed with
you when they land a CHeal and find themselves being beaten upon - and you
so low on the hate list that you need to taunt several more times to get
aggro back.

By the way, DLM's strategy is probably better than "never taunt" for SA...
SA wants to be lower on the hate list than the main tank, but higher than
anybody else. I imagine that judging this is a matter of practice and
judgement. I can say that if you start drawing aggro and you are not MA...
your cleric will probably prefer you to stop doing whatever you are doing to
draw aggro. Big heals are generally more efficient; spot healing several
people is wasteful, and *failing* to spot heal several people is risky.(*)

        ...Ronny

(*) Why it's risky: MA is at 30% HP and you're prepping a CHeal; SA is at
40% and currently has aggro. If I CHeal the SA and the MA grabs aggro, I
have to either cancel the CHeal or wait for the CHeal to hit SA. If I cancel
and the SA gets aggro back, I have to repeat the decision. Enough cancelled
CHeals and there's no time to heal either; I have to start patch-healing,
which chews up extra mana that I may not have to spare.

The "keep everybody above 80% except the MA" strategy is what I usually use,
and is much less risky, but if people keep drawing aggro I wind up
squandering mana on little heals. You may think that keeping attacking is
good because the MOB goes down more quickly, but wasted mana = more med
breaks = net DPS goes *down*, not up.

For a raid situation, keeping aggro on the MA is *it*. The clerics are in a
CHeal chain; if you get hurt, you get healed by a patch healer or you die.
If you can't control aggro, I'm sorry but the raid may be better off with
you dead.

(Sorry that I turned this into a discussion of healing strategies but hey...
I play a cleric, healing is what I do, pretty much.)
