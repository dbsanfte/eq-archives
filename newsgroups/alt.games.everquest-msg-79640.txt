I did and I found no mention of Drow...Dark Elves yes, most prominantly in
Norse Mythology but the Dark Elves of Norse Myth are what we would call
Dwarves (Known as Svartalfaheim)
I have no trouble believing that there are evil elves in folk lore but I
still hold that the term Drow was taken from the name of their "creator" for
the D&D enviroment.
The way D&D, EQ and almost all other fantasy media look at elves and the
like is taken from Tolkien's work more than folklore and myth, he obviously
got his influences from folklore but it's his twist on things that everyone
else follows.

If you can show me a site that uses Drow in a non D&D style context in the
mean time I will see if I can dig up a copy of Fiend Folio and scan the page
in, if indeed it shows what I remember it to.
