I think all the items that will improve tailoring and smithing will be 
jumping in price.  On my server Wyvern Hides were going for 20 to 30pp 
each a few months ago.  Now they are priced at around 70 to 150pp each. 
  Keep in mind that the price you are seeing in the bazaar is the upper 
end price that does not move.  The real price at which players are 
buying is probably around 40pp each for the HQ bear.
