If I was in a group with a single SK, and an SK only item dropped, I would
want the SK to have it regardless of it's value. Anything else, to me, seems
just wrong. He might not be there to help me out next time (though I've
rarely camped items. I prefer to camp exp, fun and challenges, with loot as
a nice bonus) but chances are someone in that group will remember you and
help you out some time. Karma and all that. Plus it's always nice to make
someone's day by not gimping them on their class equipment.
