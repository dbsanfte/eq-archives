Read more closely:  I said "to use the concept" - not the literal words.
Your posting that I'm referring to said:

"For those who think Verant is making excessive profits, you all know
the way to keep them from doing that... right?"

Notice the similar CONCEPT.  Presumably, you were implying that people
could simply choose not to play if they didn't want to pay.  Now, why
you compared it to the cost of living I don't know.  But, if you want
to make a semi-irrelevant comparison, it shouldn't come as a surprise
to have it referenced later on.

Hmmm... boy, you really read some huge level of anger and "persecution"
in my statement, huh?  I don't see it, but you're welcome to your own
interpretation.  As for the "harrassing" [sic] you mentioned, the mere
fact that you conjured-up the $10 dent-in-someone's-allowance in
repsonse to my posting, combined with your prevailing attitude, would
lead one to believe that you were trying to make an indirect statement.
Actually, while you're accusing me of "redirecting attention" and the
like, why did you even bring-up the $10/month issue if, as you said
yourself, "I don't even recall seeing you bitch about paying $10 a month"?

Uh, Biz, YOU brought-up the high cost of living -- oh, and let me quote
since that seems to be your main defense:

"...particularly when you compare it to $100+/mo for gas and $1500/mo
for rent on a one bedroom apartment (there's actually an apartment
complex near my house with a banner stating that as if it's some kind
of bargain...)."

Let's not forget your wonderful mentioning of the price gouging
that oil companies do:

"I figure anything
else that person has to say is pretty much based in stupidity, unless
they're talking about the oil industry or other business where the
situation is pretty much proven."

in response to the price issue, which I NEVER mentioned (a company's
profits were mentioned, but never the monthly price).  Kinda sounds
like "redirecting attention."

I guess that your own quote would work best to describe your input
to this matter:

"I guess that pretty much sums up your argument here, just making it up
as you go along, redirecting attention, talking about the high cost of
living.... whatever."

Anyway, this has been a fun flame war, but that was never my intention.
I was simply providing *my* opinion to the original poster and never
expected it to generate this much hub-bub.  Opinions are like assholes,
everyone has one and they all stink.  Let's get back to normal life here.
If people don't like what I write, don't read it and if it's so
exceptionally repugnant, don't respond to it.

I understand that you have a different opinion than I do, Biz, and I
certainly will never hold that against you, just in case I sound like
I'm the kind of person who will continue to flame whenever I see the
name "bizbee" :^)

Mike
