Here's the deal. Other people can't answer that question for you. They
can tell you what they did themselves but that is not the answer for
you. People say levels > all which IMO is the biggest load of crap I
have ever heard. In that statement the formula should be this:

Fun > all

where Fun could be levels, AA, quests, tradeskills or sitting in East
Commons playing poker at the tunnel.

Do what you want to do, what you have fun at, what you enjoy. I don't
see EQ going anywhere to soon so kick back relax and have fun :)
