I think you should stick with a hybrid class, like a shadowknight, but maybe
pick a good-aligned one like a paladin or ranger. You should play a
good-aligned character first because this gives you a greater degree of
freedom when travelling, and also the good areas of Norrath tend to be more
populated. These classes are quite easy to play and give you a good
grounding in both melee fighting and in spell-casting. You will have a
reasonable idea of how to play both types of character when you have
levelled them up a bit.
