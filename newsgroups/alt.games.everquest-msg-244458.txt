I'm well aware of what bugs have gone live in the five+ years I've
played, thanks. The bug you mentioned is normally extremely rare and
happen before you even log in. On test it was widespread, maybe even
universal, though you had to die (or possibly zone, I didn't exactly
test it extensively) to trigger some of it.

It even turned off luclin models for you if you got reset to
pre-luclin. That was a nice touch.....
