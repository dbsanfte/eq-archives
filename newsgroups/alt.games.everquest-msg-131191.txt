The earring of nature has mana free click group port to Dreadlands,
the Earring of the Solstice has Flowing Thought One.  If a druid has
to pick between the two, personally I'd take the FT1 since group port
to DL is a level 34 druid spell anyway.  Fortunately, druids get to
wear BOTH so no choice is needed

If the Earring of Nature was all/all all my non-druid characters would
take that over the Solstice... but in this case its impossible so AGAIN
no choice is needed.
