No.

I have a degree in chemistry.  No.

Electrons are no more of a mathematical construct than are the atoms that
they hold together.  Without them, covalent bonds will not form.  Atoms will
not bind to other atoms to form moleclues.

They must exist.  All evidence points to their existence.  Yet they cannot
be seen, save for the evidence of their existence.

Some point to life on this planet and say, "Without a deity, none of this
could have been created.  A deity must exist.  All of this evidence points
to the existence of a deity.  Yet one cannot be seen, save for the evidence
of one's existence."

There is no difference.  Try as you may to trivialize it, a believer's
steadfast belief system that a deity exists is no different that your
steadfast belief system that no deity exists.

Or my steadfast belief in electrons.
