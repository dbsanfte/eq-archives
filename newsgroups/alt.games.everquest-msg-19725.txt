Sometimes (such as this week) I miss my old surname. However, I don't
mind 'descriptive' last names - that is after all how many RL surnames
were created - and although my current is veering closer to a typical
druid name than I'd really like, at least I don't know of others using
it. (There are at least 2 other Blackbirds on my server)
Spooky? No. Twilight? Hell yeah. If you ever saw me gawk at a sunset
both IRL and in game, you wouldn't wonder why I put it in my name :)

Bloodblood... *snicker* Rest assured, I won't name my SK or warrior
anything like that :)
