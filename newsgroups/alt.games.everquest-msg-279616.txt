I'm not sure how that would make a difference between a hardcore group
doing writs and now those same people getting status for turning stuff
in.  I think writs will still be the main artery for gaining guild
levels, this will just be an added 'bonus' for people to either
contribute to the guild (if they are patrons) or personal status (if
they aren't patrons).  I don't see them becoming common enough or worth
so much that they will destabalize the system.  For what its worth,
most of the 'uber guilds' I know are already high 20s-30.

This will also allow the 'starter guilds' to not be on the level
elevator as people hop onto the more raiding oriented guilds.  Main
problem I see is the ability to abuse it.  Combine that with the
ability to make anybody anywhere a patron (the zone restrictions are
also going away for invites/promotions/etc) and you can depatron
everybody and only patron somebody right before they contribute to
maximize the contributions from everybody.  My baby conjuror hasn't
done any heritage quests (no need so far), but with something like this
I could pound them out until the last step, get patroned, complete the
heritages, then depatron.  There really needs to be some way to check
that kind of thing.

Agreed.
