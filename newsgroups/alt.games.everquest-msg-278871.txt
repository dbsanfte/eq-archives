If you only go LD when zoning, and zoning always makes you go LD, that
suggests to me some kind of network issue, rather than a problem
internal to your PC. You might want to consider in what ways the
networking for this machine differs from that on those machines that
have no trouble zoning. Is there a potentially suspect network card?
ARe you running some kind of software firewall or virus checker that
might interfere with network operations? Maybe even try connecting the
problem machine to a different port on the back of your router.
