But realm guards probably won't be found alone, and will help each
other.  There appears to be a dynamic aspect to this, with realm
guards being spawned where they are needed.  (They accidently set this
way to high at one point, and had a server crash when 1000 realm
guards spawned whenever anyone passed near a certain area :-)).

They should be able to tune this so that invasion is possible, but
hard and time-consuming enough for the invaded realm to rally the
defenses.

If a lot of people on a realm don't want to do PvP ever, then this
won't work.  However, I think most players will find the occasional
chance to defend their realm exciting.  There's no XP loss on PvP
death, and there's no corpse recovery (your equipment respawns with
you in DAoC...the equivalent of EQ corpse recovery is going to pray at
your gravestone, which is only needed on deaths that cause XP loss),
so all you lose in a PvP death defending your realm is the time to run
from your bind point to where you want to be.  Bindable areas seem to
be fairly common, at most a few minutes run from each other, and
anyone from your realm can bind there by simply typing "/bind".

I believe I read that you cannot bind outside your realm.  This means
that dead invaders are gone for quite a while, while dead defenders
are only a couple of minutes away from rejoining the fight at full
health and power.
