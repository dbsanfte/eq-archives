Sure.  The "top" or "endgame" guilds on each server pretty much only consist
of players willing to spend 30+ hours per week on the game and have been doing
so for a LONG time, so they have over 1000AAs and endgame equipment from the
previous expansion.

Every server I've seen has dozens of less-crazy guilds, which can roughly be
broken into "family/casual" guilds, which may raid a bit, but only things that
are a few expansions old, and "feeder" guilds, which are basically people
trying to get enough equipment and AAs to apply for a top guild.

No, this is incorrect.  There are dozens of raiding guilds on most servers.
And there are usually 1-3 endgame raiding guilds.  This has been true since
the PoP era.

If you think you're going to jump into the endgame, you'll be disappointed.
There are lots of guilds raiding stuff that is appropriate to your character,
though, having fun and getting stuff that'll be an upgrade for you.  There's
also a whole lot more single-group content for you than there was in the GoD
era when you left.
