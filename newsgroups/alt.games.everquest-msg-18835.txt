    I remember when Verant managed to shut down the EQ
auctions on Ebay. There was a substantial amount of debate,
and out-right flaming, on the topic in this newsgroup.
I remember there being a few main schools of thought. 
One, that banning the auctions would have no affect, they
would simply move to other sites.  Another had it that 
they would soon creep back into Ebay, no change there 
either.  Then there were those who argued that the auctions
were indeed gone for good, and good riddance.  Farming
would be greatly reduced, and the game would be more fun
for all the recreational players.
    Well, several months have gone by.  The auctions are
indeed still gone from Ebay (say two hundred ones when I
checked just before I wrote this, a few of the ones I 
clicked on were pulled).  Yahoo seems to have very few
auctions as well.  I'm sure that there could be a few 
sites that might have a few auctions, but I looked for
twenty minutes using Yahoo and Googol (researching this 
post, not trying to twink) and couldn't find any large
ones, certainly nothing approaching the scale of EBay 
before the clamp down.  I've seen the occasional post
of "Yada yada for sale" in this newsgroup, but not the
flood that some were predicting.
   So I was curious.  Has anyone noticed a real change
in the game play now that the auctions are gone?  Or
did I just miss the new Big Auction Site and nothing 
has really changed because of it?  Or did the auctions
really not make as big of a difference in the games as
some had assumed it did?
   Personally, I don't have really strong feeling either
way about the auctions, but I am curious as to how
others view the change.  Just for the record, this post
is an invitation for discussion, not personal flames.
I'm not wanting to blow all my real money on EQ stuff;
nor do I care if others choose to do so.  So, as is usual,
any flames sent my way will be simply ignored.
