This is correct, and fairly simple to keep track of.

It is important to note, though, that staring at the character select screen
still counts as logged on... you need to back all the way out of the game
for it to count as "off..." or you can go to Chat.  Chat time counts
as offline time, and yet your online friends can log out of the game
and into chat and find you to tell you its time to come back and
accept your res.

This is a vital bit of information when you are in a large difficult
raid that gets a total wipeout.  Stay on long enough to find out
who to consent, then drop out to the prearranged chat channel
(MT Hate being a popular one for us on Morel Thule...)

It also comes in handy, though, when you died yesterday and
couldn't find a res before you logged out... log back in 16 hours
later and your clock time is pretty short, whatever fraction
of an hour you didn't already use up after death before logging.
Make the arrangements for a res, but if it has to travel to you,
or if someone has to drag or summon that body out, logging to
chat and waiting for the call to come will buy you eight times
as much leeway.  Just make sure someone knows where you went,
and that they have to come get you!
