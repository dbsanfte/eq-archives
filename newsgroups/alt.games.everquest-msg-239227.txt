Then you'd be wrong.

A configuration where 50,000 people can't play at all is an inferior
configuration to one that affects 500,000 people "a little bit".

Imagine if California had decided to deal with their power shortage
problems a couple years back by *not* rolling the power failures...
and instead picked one district and just shut them off for a month
straight (and to add insult to injury then billed them for power too)

Sure its a more dire arrangement but the point stands: its better to
impact everyone a little than one group a lot.

If they're going to do one multi-hour patch in a 2 or 3 week period
then by all means pick on me the off-peak guy; I understand the logic
of it... but if they're going to patch and patch and patch and
patch... then start rotating patch times, because I'd like to play
this month too.
