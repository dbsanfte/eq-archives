He's hard because most people aren't 55+ in a 55+ guild.
He's hard because very few people (percentage-wise) know Chardok at all.
He's hard because enchanters aren't a dime a dozen, especially those high
enough to be sole CC for this little raid.
He's hard because single-pulling that room may be impossible (best I've seen
is 3).

He's a piece of cake, now, for my guild, but we can get together a few 50+
groups filled with people who are used to that strange zone.  Most guilds
can't without taking a bunch of inexperienced people with them.
