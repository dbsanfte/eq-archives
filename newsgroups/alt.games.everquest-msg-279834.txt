The Creator is far from the easiest DoN mission.  With that in mind, you
now have the knowledge necessary to answer your own question of what
the incentive is to choose a harder mission that results in no greater
reward.  =)

You don't understand "hardcore" raider mentality.  My guild is chomping at
the bit to take down Tunat (the boss boss of GoD).  We get better equipment
elsewhere, easier, but in spite of that there is a strong desire to take him
out for bragging rights, personal pride, whatever.

65 and 70 hp augs and over-100 hp items scattered all through GoD and OoW. 
You don't *have* to choose the suboptimal path.  DoN rewards you the MOST
(quantity).  DoN doesn't reward you the BEST.

Most.  Not best.

Or a sense of pride, bragging rights, enjoying a challenge, etc.

You will look back in a year or two and laaaaaaaugh...

Can I blame the playerbase for not figuring out that there are more
efficient DoN missions?  Can I at least laugh at them?  =)
