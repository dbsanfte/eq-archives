I've been wondering about this since last week. Early last week I was
playing my Rogue and got more than a few chest drops in the few hours I was
playing (say 8+). I switched to my Crusader the next day and the chest drop
went down to 1 or 2. Do Rogues naturally get more chest drops or was I just
unlucky?

I haven't committed a crime. What I did was fail to comply with the law.
