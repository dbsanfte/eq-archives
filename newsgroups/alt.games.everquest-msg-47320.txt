No, your faction has nothing to do with that. The only time that comes
into play is with PVP on the racewar servers or something. Otherwise,
once glower dubious or above a guard is either programmed to defend a
type of npc or not. Like a guard comes to the aid of each other or
certain npcs. Your faction has nothing to do with it.

For example, my dark elf was glower dubious with north freeport guards
and that little gnome runs out of the jewelry supplier building and
starts to fight her. She drags him to zone just in case but the guards
ignore it. She can fight him right by a bunch of guards and they do
nothing. So he is not on a defend "list." He is just green to her now
and xp but he has GM like regen.. he regens QUITE fast. She can kill
him at 37 if all of her nukes do full damage. He is not a vendor and
doesn't seem to do anything, quite odd.

Again, faction does not matter. Guards will either defend an npc or
not. There is often no way to tell which ones are or are not until
fighting them near a guard. My druid always thought those kaladim
citizens might be assisted by the dwarf guards until she finished a
few off right in front of them. The more closely related the faction
is the the more likely it is the guards are set to defend them. For
example, I would not attack a "highpass citizen" near a guard of
highpass.

The earliest example of this "defend" thing in action would be if you
were ever killing wolves or bears in qeynos hills and the guards don't
care (except they might ks you) but holly windstalker will come and
ream you. She is set to defend them and your faction does not matter.
