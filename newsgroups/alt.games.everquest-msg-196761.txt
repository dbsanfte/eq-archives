What does this have to do with my question?  Or are you just feeling

It's a stupid requirement.  It's like having no "auto attack" option

seconds.

Then you're just being purposefully obtuse.  The physical requirement
is stupid.

That analogy is so bad it doesn't deserve a response.

That analogy is also so bad it doesn't deserve a response.

I'll be happy to respond further if you can (a) stop acting like
an ass, and (b) can come up with reasoned arguments why making
bards twist songs "the hard way" is a good thing.

If you can't find it in yourself to respond without being insulting
either directly or indirectly, please don't bother to respond.
Thanks.
