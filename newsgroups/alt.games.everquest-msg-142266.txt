Real Faydedar doesn't live long.. stupid lizard monks!

Im almost tempted to label this as an "exp" group camp now

> Trakanon (Old Sebilis)

Once you can take down VS consistantly and on a regular basis, Trak becomes
doable.  He sounds rough, he has a very nasty dot, blinds, and "trak
touches" (ports somebody to the shrooms).. back in the days when we used to
kill him, he either died in <30 seconds, or we died.

Of course now with manaburn, get a group to clear the juggs, get 4 wizards,
and say bye bye to trak

A single group of 60's could do the prot

exp camp

bitch!!  she only has tiny HP, but oh man back in the day, did this cow make
my guilds chardok raids have a sad ending

u know him

> Overking Bathezid (Chardok)

I think hes higher level than the queen.. has a butload more hp etc, but hes
a much easier kill

> Gorenaire (Dreadlands)

A tough dragon, in the way that Vox is compared to Naggy

> Talendor (Skyfire Mountains)

Well if your in VP at the time (as you mentioned above as one spell
possibility) then Talendor wouldnt pose too many problems.  I think hes at
least half as difficult as Gore

> Severilous (Emerald Jungle)

Blink and you'd miss him

> Lhranc (City of Mist)

The toughest epic fight?  I know its not much nowadays, but he used to be a
pretty big mob

> Ixiblat Fer (Burning Woods)

Wouldnt surprise me if single groups could drop him now (not MB groups
obviously)

As james mentioned, torpor can also drop from Sontalak and Klanicar.
Sontalak is a real beast.

Klandi is kinda like the big brother of Zlandi (another first brood - in
DN).  Once a guild is clearing VP they would have np with zland, and then it
would just work up from there i guess

First brood - one of the series of dragons that drops the talisman to gain
entrance to Sleepers Tomb.

It might seem like a shitload of money, but by the time you get level 60, if
you bought a copy of Torpor for 30k, I don't think you'd even regret it for
a second
