I think the best plan they tried was the "tooth" system used in
Velious; you could only get ports to places where you'd already
been and picked up a "tooth" which was a ground spawn in that
ring.

Eventually they discarded this for some reason I never could
fathom, I'd have gone the other way and included it for every
sort of port and every character in the game; you can only take
shortcuts to places you've already been to "the hard way" at
least once.

Now that they have the "key ring" they could put the tooth's
(tooths?  Toothz?) on the ring so there'd be no clutter, and
therefore no need for the "if you have tooth Z you can discard X
and Y" thing they had for velious.  Its been so long I don't even
remember if you had to have the thing in inventory to get a port;
at any rate, keyring it and it wouldn't even take up bank space.
