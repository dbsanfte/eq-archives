There was never class penalty on Enchanter, it being one of the hardest
classes to play. Erudites Int based Chars, Ogres Melee based chars and
Iksars had a race penalty. Iksar Necromancer I think was the hardest hit for
penalty. Race penalties were never removed but Class penalties were, ie
Hybrids.
