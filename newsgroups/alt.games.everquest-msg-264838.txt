Is that what you do in real life, get born as someone else and live 
their life a bit figuring things out, then die and get reborn as someone 
else when you figure out what you really want to be?

Maybeso at that, its at least as logical as any other religion, and 
should be a great consolation when things are miserable...'Its not your 
real life, you're just testing things out to see how they work'

Course it seems to me it would have a drawback in the large number of 
suicides by people eager to get to their real lives.
