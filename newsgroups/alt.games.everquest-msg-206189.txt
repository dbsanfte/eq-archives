In a raid situation Acumen is crap and takes up a priceless buff
slot.  I click it off about a nanosecond after it lands.  Truesight
and Faerune make whatever feeble justification that once existed for
keeping it up obsolete.

Billy is pretty nice but most often you have to ask to have it recast
after clicking some other stuff off to make room.  I'm pretty sure a
lot of people don't realise it now stacks properly so don't think to
ask for it.  As of a few months ago it still had horrible stacking
issues and once people get this stuff in their head well it's hard to
persuade them otherwise - I still have to explain that you need to
click off SoT if you want BSS to stick on almost a nightly basis for
example.
