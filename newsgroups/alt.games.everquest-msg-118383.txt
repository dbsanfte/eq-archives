I should have thought this was too obvious to need pointing out, but in the 
long spectrum from a virus to a human being, the animal/plant divide is a 
convenient place to put the line between what it's too close to "kin" to 
eat, and what it's okey to eat, at least until a substitute is found. Now, 
I suppose you can find someone out there who feels human beings are closer 
to plants, and therefore eats only animal products, but I wager that would 
be a minority.

I think you are jumping from "Greenpeace activists are idiots" (with which 
I agree) to "polluting the water is okey". If this were a debate on 
conservation, which it isn't, you could compare me not with an activist, 
but simply with a guy who cycles to work instead of taking the car. I can't 
change the world, but I can choose to behave in a way that I believe makes 
a difference, however small.

I actually look forward to the extintion of all beef cattle, I think it 
would be a positive development... Hell, farm animals are screwed if we all 
turn vegetarian, but guess what, they are *already* screwed anyway... It's 
not like any farm animals die of old age.

It makes enough of a difference for me.
