However, there *is* the regular melee damage bonus to your main hand.
So, regardless of the fact that the MoSS has better raw dam/dly ratio,
since it's faster it's even better because of the additional damage from
the bonus.

If your SK isn't high enough level to have a damage bonus, then Bah! on
you :p

I, too, don't understand why this isn't clear cut... Better ratio on the
MoSS, +10 int on the MoSS, better damage over time due to lower delay +
damage bonus on the MoSS.... Were we just trying to wave our bits 'n'
pieces about to show off, or what?
