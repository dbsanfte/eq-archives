i am so tired of this - get over yourself
the original players, we beta testers, were scandalized if were NOT
inspected
i usually only inspect someone just before i hand them some toy i know i
will only get 3 or 4 plat from vendor yet will make their day, they throw a
fit cuz i inspect them, it is gonna go to someone else
now if i was to inspect you and start begging you for the gear you were
wearing,  could see you having a beef
