There's no reason that a level 4 monk "needs" a fungi, if you're that
desperate to PL him to 50, go buy a druid on ebay and PL him yourself on
your second computer.  And while your at it, stay the hell away from
anywhere I hunt on my alts.

Back when my long gone warrior was level 14 or so, he was starting a group
at a derv camp in Nro, and some level 6 monk with a fungi, IFS, and a bunch
of other stuff came and said he was camping the dervs as soon as his PLer
got there, then he waved a pair of Mithril Arms at me and said that if I
went away he'd give them to me, well, I started a group, some level 45ish
cleric came and sat there (but wasn't the guy's PLer) and laughed at the
monk who claimed we were camp stealing him, since all the monk was doing was
sitting there watching the camp eat dinner, yet every time someone shouted a
camp check, he'd shout "derv 2".

If you're gonna play an alt that's that heavily twinked, at least have the
decency to not be somewhere that all the normal newbies go to hunt.  I have
no real problem with twinking, other than the fungi twinks that run around
and kill everything in a zone filled with real newbies.

I personally have a cleric and warrior who are really just "I can't sell
this crap" twinks, and then my necro who's just the "caster crap I can't
sell" twink (flayed skin, stuff I looted while farming silk in crystal
caverns, some other crap I've picked up somewhere along the way, and
student's homework and a crystalline silk belt from velks, I'll probably
sell the belt soon though)

I really only have a problem with twinking someone with regen items or
flowing thought items, since they're hard enough to come by as it is.
