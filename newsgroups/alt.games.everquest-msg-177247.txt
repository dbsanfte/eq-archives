I couldn't agree more. I remember back when I had my low level monk from
freeport who had made the sash quests there and who wanted to get the
headbands from qeynos. I had prepared my trip, lightsource, food, bandage,
compass, maps. Checked everything a milion time. Met so nice people at
rivervale (one became my friend and I still see her everydays one year
later) who helped me into Runnyeye and beholder's maze.......

THAT was great a lot more realistic and rewarding then click, click and
click.

Just my humble opinion,
