And where, pray tell, have I asserted that prayer does _not_
involve God?  Was it when I wrote of "telling God about your
wishes"?  Self-therapy?  You appear, again, to be overlooking
the "God" bit.

I have yet to encounter any area of the human experience that
does not involve paradox.  That does not, in my opinion, make
logic inapplicable.  It does, however, limit the usefulness of
logic as a tool when considering spiritual or social questions.
