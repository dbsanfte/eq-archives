Hmm... Let's see if I can come up with a possible example. You are just 
walking down the street outside the maternity services of a hospital, and a 
guy bursts out, positively beaming. He looks up and down the street, sees 
you, grabs you, and tells you, almost incoherent with excitement "It's a 
girl!!".

Your possible responses:

a) Congratulations!

b) Don't touch me! I'm calling the police, you evil nut!

Me, I'd go with a)

I guess the two things are basically linked... If your head wiring is such 
that you don't feel the need to share an accomplishment, you'll be baffled 
by those who do, and the other way around.
