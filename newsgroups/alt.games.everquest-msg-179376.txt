Well some of the new features seem a waste of time but the LFG feature is
going to make a real difference and I am looking forward to seeing the
geographical feature maybe it will be like the feature in Legends.

It seems strange that after the release of POK i understood there where
going to be no more upgrades and then suddenly here we have one, O well
guess Sony are short of a dollar or two.
