I logged in today with the sole intention of getting in on an adventure 
or two. Early in the day on a Saturday, I was having trouble finding a 
group. I finally found a necro near my level who was also LFA, so we 
decided to hook up and LFM. I should have taken it as an omen when she 
showed up a female DE in her underwear - no, not on a CR, just running 
around nekked.

After nearly a half hour, we have a full group. Some seem to be pretty 
new to LDoN, but that's ok. We all were at some point. I think we're in 
good shape with a cleric, 2-shaman, 2-warriors and a necro though.

We get to the crypt, buff up and head in to get started. The puller 
begins pulling multiples rather than waiting on the cleric to lull the 
room. I planned to explain the benefits of lull when we get a break. No 
big deal, I'll just root adds until then. Every mob I rooted had root 
broken by the necro's pet. *Every* one. I spammed...

GET RID OF THE PET!!!
GET RID OF THE PET!!!
GET RID OF THE PET!!!

...to no avail. We wiped on the *second* room for crying out loud! One of 
the tanks disbanded without a word. Jerk. Why didn't I think of if first? 
Ok, just kidding. I wouldn't have, but I'm sure he saw the writing on the 
wall.

I took a deep breath and merely suggested that we get on the same page. 
Adds will be rooted, MA can back the main target away from the adds and 
then we can all /assist the MA. Heads nodded all around. Rough start, but 
not a problem. We still had over an hour to go.

When we zoned back into the dungeon, the necro immediately started asking 
about a rez. I figured that it just hadn't occurred to her that it would 
be a better idea to rez at the end, so I suggested as much. Again, heads 
noded all around.

We get back at it and I think we now have a good idea of what we're all 
doing, because the first few pulls go as planned. Then it happened. The 
necro over nuked and drew aggro. Pet goes out of control, necro runs 
around the room like an idiot, aggro'ing even more mobs and I start 
trying to pull them off of her. I can't root the first one, because the 
pet won't leave it alone. She takes off for the zone. By this time, the 
adds she picked up running around are beginning to turn our tank into 
hamburger. The cleric and I start chain healing to try and keep both him 
and the other shaman (now meleeing) alive. It's total bedlam as aggro is 
passed around like a hot potato. Tank goes down, followed soon by the 
rest of us.

*Big* sigh. At this point we decide that the best we can do is go at it 
for the xp until time expires. The necro starts talking about a rez 
again. I want to smack her. Then "she" says she go permission from "her" 
wife to play for 10 more minutes. o_O I'm not even going there, but I 
that explained the underoos look - to me anyway.

We get deeper into the dungeon when "she" says she has to go and can 
someone give here a rez. I told her to go drag her corpse here and I'm 
sure the cleric wouldn't mind. She took off. A few moments later I 
noticed her zone out and then back in. "Can't drag a corpse through 
zone" she says. WTF? I have no idea how her corpse made it outside unless 
she zoned out earlier running away and died from a DoT or something. 
Well, she saw that we had no intention of running all the way back to the 
zone to give her a 20% rez, so she humbly disbanded.

That left four of us, still just planning to spend the remainder of the 
adventure just getting what xp we could. We made it to the time limit 
without another incident.

Last twist - I had loaned 2-handmade backpacks to the ML at the beginning 
and someone else had also loaned him a regular backpack. Guess what I got 
back from him after the other donor had logged? You got it, one handmade 
backpack and one regular. A fitting end to a borked up adventure.  :(
