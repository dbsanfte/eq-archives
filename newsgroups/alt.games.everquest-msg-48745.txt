 Yes, please, please avoid "dewd-speak". I will generally help anyone
that asks for help if I can, but I will -always- ignore people who use
d00d, dewd, plz, thx, and any other cryptic forms of shorthand. Sure,
there are times when I run into people that it's obvious that english
is not their primary language and I will try to accomodate them, but
"dewd-speak" drives me as well as many others bananas.
 
 This does not include shorthand used in the heat of battle to speed
up communication between people in a group or raid. That is different, 
it's a tactic for survival.
