You can try this:

Run DXDiag from start menu and verify DX9 is installed.
Check tab 2 or 3 I think and verify this is not true:
DDraw Status: Not Available
D3D Status: Not Available
If true attempt to retest and enable.
If unsucessfull attemp an driver (new or archived) that is DX9
compliant or compatible.

That's all I can think of atm. Can't sleep and tired so it's probably
a bunch of garble. Honesty try tech forun and post dxdiag txt file for
better assistance. Kinda hard to help with the limited info.

Oh but just fyi on some of the problems because some of them seem to
stem from old compliant/compatible issue -

Per TSRChad statement in tech forums:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TSRChad:
If a video card is DirectX9 compatible but not compliant that means is
that it will not utilize the DirectX 9.0 features.

Customer:
Does this mean that if I do not buy a new vid card, my P3 500MHz 384Mb
Ram machine , will forever now run EQ at 5fps regardless of what
patching comes this week or whenever?

TSRChad:
The best answer I can give you is it depends. There are too many
variables to say yes or no, but with some adjustment on the settings
you should be able to get enough FPS in order to play.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hehe, I've heard a simular eq tech line before man...

So, for me this says vid cards like mine, and possibly yours, will
have game play like Shir Val when Luclin first came out for about the
same period of time (mainly focusing on GoD and PoK zones for the most
issues since the other clasic zones are not very very bad like there.
If I recall was about a solid month or two of lag in luclin at first
introduction but there was a command UseUmbra=False (I think that was
it) that helped with the engine issues then.)

My question is, if this is history repeating itself in some way...
Where are my new character models? LOL, next expansion I bet...

Oh well night and hears to a sucsessful patch that will (hopefully)
prove history wrong or at least have a ini command to use the old
engine like last time ;)
