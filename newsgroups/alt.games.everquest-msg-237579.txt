Ill get the tech stuff out of the way first...
Im running an
AMD Athlon XP 2400
512 MB Ram
NVDIA GeForce4 Ti 4200 with AGP8x Ver 6.14
WinXP Home OS
US Robotics 56k Fax/Modem (Only dial-up here)
Everything is updated.
I have most graphics turned down under options.

K....when I connect to EQ....Everything is usually fine.  I zone a few
times, and all is good.
Then, Perhaps I zone, or, do nothing.  I start getting bad lag/packet loss.
Between 4 and 5k.
This will either correct itself at random, or, it wont.
If I camp out, and come back on....things are usually fine....but, I will
eventually have the lag.
Last night, a new one started.
It would act like I was disconnecting...reach about 80% loss or so....then
high lag for 10 or so seconds, then repeat....till I was eventually dropped.
Doesnt matter to much what zone Im in...

Any ideas?  Advice?
