(I hope I get the right names for the right ideas)

I think I understand Jazz's position, that some of these changes will
make the game "too much easier" for little gain in terms of playability
and enjoyment.

I think I understand Ben's position, that the gains in terms of
playability and enjoyment far out weigh the "dumbing down of the game".

I think I understand Lokari's position, that these changes open the
*posibility* that VI are now more worried about producing a profit than
maintaining a top-end game and that future changes could make EQ more
like a playstation game.

First off all this discussion is about opinion, not fact, and some of
Ben's responces are a bit beyond the pail. Everyone is entitled to an
opinion, so here is mine, probably some where between Jazz/Lokari and
Ben.

I'm going to use Jazz's 3 big bones (of contention)

Bone 1 Spell books

> passage" to get rid of it. Hello? Is this on?
> 
I think that removing the spell book pre-35 will make leveling very
marginally easier. I think that it could actually help casters to learn
their game (if they can see what their pet is doing / when pulls come in
/ etc.) I think that it will make the game *much* less frustrating and
thus help new players to stay in the game and keep EQ at the top of the
on line game pile.

Jazz is right that it does remove a rite of passage, but I think that
the rewards of new spell levels, new hunting areas, new tactics and new
equipment as we level are sufficient reward for me. Jazz your biggest
shouts have been for /defencive and for level 50. Admitidly your highest
level character is not a caster, but when was the last time you saw a
mail here saying yes I made 35 and got rid of the book that did not
include at least a mild expletive about the book (damn book, bloody book
etc). 
As I said in another post I don't think the book makes things much
harder, just much duller. If a high threshold to boredom is the
requirment to play this game (in some ways it is) then sure keep the
book. If you want the game to be more fun more of the time then geet rid
of it.
Its not like they are letting you med while standing / fighting, or
putting in a button that says "restore all mana".

I think that this has been done for 2 reasons. 
1) VI have probably noticed that a lot of accounts are cancled after the
first month with the player never having got above level 4/5/6/7. This
is bad business, not just the lost account, but the lost PR (I tried
that game, but I kept dieing and lost all my stuff and no one would help
me, don't play it). Feal free to counter that we don't want those people
in the game, but I know a few people who are just the sort of people I
like to meet in the game (People like you and me Jazz) who quit cause
they got very frustrated at early levels.
2) VI are fed up with (dumb) ubers twinking sub-6 toons and loosing
their equipment of uberness.

I agree with you Jazz that (real) newbies will now not learn all of
those leasons during the levels 1 to 10. However there are lots of other
things that real newbies need to learn during those levels. How to make
macros, how to consider, where to fight, grouping, doing quests, how to
buy and sell, where to get spells, lots of things. I agree that this
change will push some of the problems from the level 1 characters up to
the level 10 caracters, but for real newbies that is actually a good
thing. Would you rather have one 8 hour lecture or two 4 hour lectures
spread over 2 days ? I think that they will learn *better* this way.

For anyone who is not a real newbie level 1-10 are a joke anyway. (IMHO)

This change worries me slightly more that the removal of the book, but
not much more, and in the end it is good for us if the game keeps a
large player base. As the larger the player base the more coders they
can afford, thus the more content and the more bug fixes. These are good
things.

I agree with you Jazz, saying that this was always a bug does not negate
any other argument that can be raised, but saying that Hell levels are a
rite of passage does not mean that they are not mind numbingly dull and
quite stupid.

Hell levels are not Hard in a game play sense they are hard in a "Im
about to go bloody mad" sense. I dinged 32 last night, and the releef of
beeing out of the pain / splat level was un believeable. (I did die once
in 31-2 and it hurt) I was releaved. I was happy, but I did not think to
my self "I have now passed my first rite of passage, tomorrow I will be
a man", no I thought "Thank christ that crap is over with".

Hell levels are an example of making the game a chalange in patience. A
battle against frustration more that a test of skills tactics and
inteligence. If you really think that the way to get to the top of the
game should be based on who can stare at a book and kill the same mobs
repeatedly for hours then you obviously have a different vision to me.

Providing that it is still just as hard to get to 50 as it was before
(as VI have stated) then I have no problem with this change at all. It
removes frustration (did my xp bar move ?) and boredom (I had better
stay here and kill these mobs cause this is the only way to get through
hell) and replaces it with something aproching a logical progression.

I mean if the hell levels were those before a new spell rank then I
could almost see a role play logic. 


I do fear to some degree that VI will go too far and make the game into
ElvishQuake, but I don't think that we are in free fall yet. For my 2cp
these changes are basically good. I am slightly worried about the future
implications of the no CR till 10 change and I hope that VI implement
the no hell levels so that it is still just as HARD to get to 50, jus
not as frustrating.

Jim, trying to keep the middle ground without trading on everyones feet.
