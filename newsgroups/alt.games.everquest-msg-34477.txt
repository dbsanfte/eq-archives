Never having played a kiting/soloing class, and having no clue about a Warden
Symbol of Tunare aside from the fact that it can apparently root endlessly,
take this question as newbie inquisitiveness.   Assuming you could keep on
rooting it, and you can continue to med up while it's rooted, couldn't you
just keep applying damage until you finally won?
   Keep in mind, I'm fully aware that in reality, that can't be the case, or
everybody with one of these could instantly solo every non-summoning creature
in the game, but what's the limiting factor? Would the mob be healing itself
faster than you could inflict damage? Casting on you while you tried to med?
Gating away?
