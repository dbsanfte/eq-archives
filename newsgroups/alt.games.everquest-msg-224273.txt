That's the route I normally take. It may not be the most efficient, but I 
can cover ground fast enough now that it doesn't matter much. :)

While you're there, look into getting the Combine versions of all your 
instruments unless you've got something better. Reed's bard spreadsheet 
(available at http://www.dotnetdiva.com in the Files section) lists the 
bonuses for all the bard instruments. I think most are 10-15pp with the 
horn being like 55pp.
