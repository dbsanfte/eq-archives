found the post in the EQ2 knowledge base ....

"We experienced an unfortunate delay with U.S. Customs in clearing 
importation of recent shipments of the "tin" in which it is packaged. As a 
result we will not begin shipping the orders for these units until late this 
week.

We offer you our apology."


that's about all it says apart from giving the option to cancel your 
pre-order for the CE version ... you'd think they'd have had that sorted 
long before the game actually launched ... but what do I know? :)

Servers are down for the second day in a row, that I know of, for a 4 hour 
patch ... 11am - 3pm UK time both days
