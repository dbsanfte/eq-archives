My second problem will be finding a raid I can get away with leaving
after 5 hours.

If you look at those raids, the majority are in the morning US time,
when I can't play as of yet. I lamented this to a friend recently and
he pointed me to a raid mailing list that usually has a 6pm EST raid
once a week and a morning raid once a week, I'm hoping to be able to
sign up for the evening raids.
