I used to move in some heavily french speaking circles, and had the phrase

/g je ne parle pas francais
on a social key, because conversation would tend to drift into
incomprehensibility if I didn't mention it.

I never did manage to learn the equivalent phrase in korean despite
grouping and raiding some with a korean guild, because while the french
(and canadian) players generally did have strong english skills, the
koreans in question did not, and I never did get across the question I was
asking ("how do you say 'I don't speak korean'")
