No shit!  I took a run over last night to do the quest for the new
ranger level 44 DoT spell.  I swim over to the south beach to start
killing mosquitos and scorpions, and as soon as I come out of the
water, there's three mobs on me, including a named (Mokon
Brokenskull).  After an initial panic attack at seeing a named mob
pounding on me, I do a quick con, and see that all three, including
the named, are green, so I decide to just melee them down. WELL.  I
finish off Mokon and have an Emaciated Zombie and a Vicious Skeleton
left to kill.....and realize I have just under a bubble of health
left, and my heal spell isn't memorized (I buffed as soon as I zoned
in).  Fortunately, root was up...so I root the zombie....whee....still
over half a bubble of health left...run a bit more...root the
skeleton.  I move off a bit to memorize heal, and the skeleton breaks
root and interrupts the memorizing of the spell ...on a riposte, I
notice I hit it pretty hard, so I thought screw it, chances are I'll
be killed trying to get another root off, I'll melee it down....I'm
beating the hell out of it (it IS a green con after all), get him to
down to I SWEAR less than an eighth..I swear I could barely see any
colour on his bar, and then BAM...LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...

Fortunately, it was crowded in the Gulf of Gunthak, and I got a rez as
soon as I got back in the zone.  The WORST part of all this?  I didn't
even goddam get to loot Mokon.  Fucking green mobs....
