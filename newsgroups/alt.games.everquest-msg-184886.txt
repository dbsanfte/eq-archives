Sorry, don't want to flame, I have always Dots with me, but I have never
seen a Cleric > 45 who went out of a group with less loot than he spend
on Dots. Playing a Cleric myself from time to time i know what I am
talking about. When I am in group as a Cleric I tell the group after I
join: Either you pay me back the Dots or I'll loot as much as I spend on
Dots. You know what? sometimes I get a stack or 2, sometimes I am told
to loot. Both ways are fine.
The Problem here, is that most Cleric don't know alot about other
Classes it seems.
Examples?
Here we go:
Necros spend a Dot per pet.
Enchanters spend Gems on Runes
Mages spend gems on Pets (I know not that expensive)
How many CotH you got without paying for the perl?

...
Have you ever seen a Chanter telling the Group: hey I want to MLoot to
get the money on gems back? And you don't want a Chanter slowing your
mobs without Rune, as you will spend hellalot more Mana on them.

So calm down...
