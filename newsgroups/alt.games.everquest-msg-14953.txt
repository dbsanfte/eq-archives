This idea would be fine if buffs just did one thing. The areas where they
have problems is the cracks forming around multiple-effect buffs (like
getting PotG to stack with Cleric HP buffs).
Given the variety of buffs in the game right now you'd likely end up with a
situation where the number of 'buff classes' is damn close to the number of
buffs in total. And then your stacking code is gonna be a massive tangle and
a complete biyotch to QA. Hmm, sounds familiar...
