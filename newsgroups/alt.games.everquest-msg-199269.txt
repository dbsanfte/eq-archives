We just bought the box set (one with the lady figure) and thought it would
be as simple as Sims - just call for another account number and pay for
that.

(Sims sucks - lol just thought I would say it - sorry sims fans)

Well they said we have to buy a new cd. :-(  We wouldn't mind paying for the
key/account but to also go out and by a new game... :-(  Sheese.  So after
reading this thread I am (assuming here) we need another "redbox" edition so
we can both play the same planes/maps?

Newbie here don't hurt me!
