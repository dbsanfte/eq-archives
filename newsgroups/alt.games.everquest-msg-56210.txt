Looking at the notes of the last patch, but not being able to get connected
I had an issue with the coin message.  Having a Monk as my main character
droping coins on the ground is something I do when I can't get to a bank.
Dropping 100 copper coins reduces my weight by 2lbs.  When you have a weight
limit of 15lbs or your AC starts to drop.  Anyone know if they there is away
around this new code.
