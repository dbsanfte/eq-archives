To give SOE some benefit of the doubt about their intentions, they may
be wondering if there is enough consensus to justify making legal and
safe something that is certainly going on anyway. If they were to
implement something to make character transfers safe and final, their
GMs (however few or many there are, however well or poorly they do
their jobs) won't have to deal with /petition I bought an
account/character on EBAY and they stole it (I know, such a /petition
highlights an EULA violation).

Same thing for sale of equipment poll.

BTW, I don't think they should do either since the former would
encourage more powerleveling (to generate saleable characters) and the
latter would encourage more extreme farming.

But, if implemented, I might make use of it. Depends...
