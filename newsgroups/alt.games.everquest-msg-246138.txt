I'd say they were dumping unused stock. I've bought lots of things like that
in PoK... used to vendor mine pretty much exclusively. The library seemed to
have the best pickings. Made a fortune on nightmare silks once; bought a few
stacks and made a fortune, then blew it on blue diamonds only to have the
market crash.

I don't know, maybe everyone on your server who is going to max jewelcraft
is using other areas or means (eg gold geode rings) to what I was using.
After all, I used to be able to buy stacks of velium pieces from thrugadin;
people were selling it for practically nothing... now, i have a vendor with
stacks of them and a high price, hoping to sell so I can buy stacks more of
tailoring items; to see if i can get just one more point of tailoring, just
one more!
