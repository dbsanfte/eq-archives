I have a lvl 30 mage and I still have a lot of newbie questions.  The thing
is, I've never played any game even remotely close to EQ, so a lot of the
stuff you talk about and take for granted, I've never heard of before.  I
understand the basic idea of killing and lvling, but when you start throwing
out other stuff, I can easily get confused.

But I get a lot of people who say to me "How can you be lvl 30 and not know
that?"  Well, that's why.
