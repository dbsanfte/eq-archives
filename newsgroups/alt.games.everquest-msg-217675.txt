I met him at a talk he gave in Berlin, mostly about his adventures in 
Borneo, and he's indeed every bit as funny in person as he's in the 
books. Unfortunately, I was too star-struck and tongue-tied to make the 
most of it :( I did get that book signed, at least.

I also used to lurk in alt.fan.pratchett, and I concur it's a very weird 
group indeed. I didn't post much, and I never got a follow-up from him, 
but I did have a follow-up once from Ken MacLeod in rec.arts.sf.written. *
Nasty* newsgroup, that... I'm just too old to keep up with the flammage 
there.
