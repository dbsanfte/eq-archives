It seems that you failed to read this other thread.

What I have been insisting is that killstealing exists in CoH, and that 
CS should recognize complaints of it properly instead of dismissing them 
out of hand as player fabrications of an event that can't happen.

I never once said EQs system is better or preferable. I think for the 
most part CoHs system is better. But not so much better that its 
eliminated the very possibility of killstealing as Xocyll seems so 
intent on 'proving'.
