I have gotten my Shaman to lvl 14 so far, the zones seem allright but havn't
done that much snooping around.. As for your Video card if you go to
www.everquest .com and then go to "Luclin Support" look on the right side for
"supported video cards" you can check to see what cards they support and also if
they do they will also have the latest drivers for that card.
