Here's the deal. If you want to do Charity ports, that's fine, but DON'T
expect someone to pay you if you don't ask. If you are like me and want
compensation for your port, Ask for a fixed price up front. Don't try to
cheat them by asking "what will you pay" just ask for the price you want up
front, no pay, no port.

I will usually port someone who is on a CR. (Unless they are rude and
annoying, thinking it is my *JOB* to port people I don't know around). I DO
NOT usually port Newbies who say "I don't know how to get to Freeport" in
Qeynos. The Game is MADE to be hard to jump from one place to another. Best
way to learn your way is to walk your way carefully from one place to
another.

As a semi-high level Druid, Time is mana and mana is money. I can easily
make 50-100p in the time I waste finding someone, porting them out (300
mana) and porting back (150 mana if I am lucky) and finding my camp again
and medding my mana back. Therefore, I often refuse ports for 10p. On the
other hand, If I'm not doing anything at the time, 10p is a fine amount. To
get me to leave a camp, I'd have to have at least 100p, and sometimes that
isn't enough. To get me to leave a group, it would have to be more.

Mullo 55 Druid, Vazaelle.
