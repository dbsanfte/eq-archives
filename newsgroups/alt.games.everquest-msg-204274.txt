With the closing of the hole (June 11 patch) that allowed KEI and
certain high-level buff spells to be cast on sub 46(?) level
characters, your suggestion is a bit out of date.

Breeze, Clarity and Clarity II are mana regen buffs that a 4th level
character can get (I know I missed others). Once he gets Dark Pact,
get someone to cast one of the HP regen spells (e.g. chloroplast?) on
him and use Dark Pact -- DP converts hp to mana while chloroplast
regens hp -- to regen mana though it's not necessary if he uses
Lifespike and other hp stealing spells to get back the hp that are
being converted to mana.
