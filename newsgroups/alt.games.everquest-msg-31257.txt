This is what the game deteriorates into at high level, probably unless you
live in the US and have a moderately reliable connection. The game is just
too frustrating when you have to re-level over and over, simply because the
network cuts you off and you die while netdead. Ive heard the arguments for
it, to stop cheating blah blah. Ever heard the expression.. the cure being
worse than the disease?

Time to move on. For anyone with imperfect connections... DO NOT BUY THIS
GAME. For any compeditors, either have more benign disconnect rules or
forget about at least 1 sale. For any "seeya later, I dont care" posters,
stfu and save bandwith.

Pity, cos apart from the disconnects its a lot of fun.
