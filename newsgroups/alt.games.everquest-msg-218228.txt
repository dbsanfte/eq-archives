I'm pissed at myself because I didn't realize that if you voted "no" on
the recall, you were also allowed to vote on a candidate if the recall
happened anyhow.  Maybe I wasn't the only dipshit, and maybe if all of us
dipshits had figured this out, someone other than Arnold would have won (I
probably would have voted for Bushmante). AT least Bushmante won in my
county. :/
