Here's my suggestions for fun and a little advice take it if you want it as
it is given freely or leave it as it may slip on by.
Drunken newb nekkid gnome races rock!
also for raiding if your not experienced as a guild working together for a
raid hit befallen, I realize it's a "newb" raiding spot but its pretty easy
even if no good "lewt" to speak of (yeah I know there's a couple things) but
that might be a start of dungeon raiding. That's what our guild does for our
lower level members to teach to follow raid leader instructions and if
people don't, hey it BEFALLEN no real harm done we send in our higher level
members for CR's.
that's my 2cp
also have an archery contest for fun event (give everyone some alcohol and a
bow) first person to kill a nekkid newb character wins (yeah im a big fan of
nekkid drunken newb events)
"Very angry day. Very much sad day. Very tedious day.
Let's try to fly slippers with a foot. A feeling is good. Are after as
flying it, but let's take notice it." <--- Very excellent Japanese
post-card.
