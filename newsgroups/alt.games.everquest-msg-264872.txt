I have to admit a fondness for GURPS, probably as much because of its 
origins in Melee and Wizard, and then ITL as for the system itself, but 
also the vast realm of possibilities inherent in it, and the efforts 
they went to to explore those possibilities.

Call of Cthulhu, however, was also a great game, and one that did a lot 
more to convince me that a good system wasn't really necessary. 
Further, it had IMO the best campaigns ever published for any game, and 
I'm the sort of GM who enjoys embroidering an existing module/campaign 
more than creating one from the ground up.

AD&D's strength was in its powerful vision and wealth of support; 
unfortunately you have to be able to spend hundreds of dollars on the 
game system now if you want to explore all that it has to offer... I 
know because I'm watching my daughter get immersed in it, and its just 
astounding how many $30 books she's already managed to accumulate.

Never could get into C&S, did some Travellor but tended to ignore the 
system as much as anything.  Aftermath was fun and had an underlying 
system that -could- have been GURPS but they never really did anything 
with it.  Champions was another fun toy to play around with, and years 
later I really enjoyed the thick moody feeling of the World of Darkness 
games, although I'm sad to say that the one I liked best, Mage, wasn't 
something I could run well and never found anyone else who ran it at all.
