Of course it is.  But if you play the game under 70, you will eventually be
70, and most people continue to play the game at that point at a static
level.  Using myself as an example, I've been level 70 for a much larger
portion of the time since it was available than the portion of time I was
under-70.  The same applies for a large portion of the user base for 65, 60
and 50 in the past.

To use the most bizarre analogy I can come up with, I got old enough to
drive, vote, and drink, and I still looked forward to many years of life at
my static "adult level".  =)

The fact is, I look at your "100 to 1k plat/day" and consider that
reinforcement of what I said (I don't generally get any better unless I am
consciously trying, which may involve farming mobs intended for lower
levels).

In fact, many comments about "the EQ economy being severely broken" relate
to how lower level characters can get higher level items super cheap.  I
know *many* level 70s that stay "broke" (I have millions of pp, but I am the
exception rather than the rule).
