> Well, it's too late to do it now.

  I dunno, that's what Verant kept telling us about the experience
penalties... but as the game imbalance grew more and more serious and more
and more people became aware of it, eventually they broke down and "fixed"
it.

  So, I hestitate to ever say it's too late for anything.  Sure, something
might seem implausible, or too resource intensive to practically happen...
but you never know.  None of us can see the code, or have access to the EQ
item database, perhaps making a change like this would easier than some of
us think.

  Or, perhaps they could make it so anybody could use any item, but in order
to get some of the nicer benefits from certain items (stat boosts, ultra
high AC, procs and right-clickable effects) they would have to be a certain
level.  To an extent this is already implemented with the level-based damage
caps and making it necessary to achieve a certain level to get weapons to
proc.  Perhaps a damage/delay ratio cap based on level could also be
imposed.  Something else they could do is implement an AC cap for each
class, level 10 ranger, for instance, wouldn't be able to produce a pre-buff
AC more than a few points over what they'd get with full banded armor.  They
could do the same with stat/HP boosts.  They could make it so from levels
1-10, you can only have a cumulative total of, say, around +10 to stat
boosts from equipment, and +20 to HP/mana.  From 10-15 the number might be
bumped up to +15 for stat boosts, and +40 HP/mana... ect.

  Up around level 40 or so the caps could be raised to the point where they
are pretty much irrelavent and some of the more "uber" items could have
manually set level requirements.

  I don't really care, though.  I don't twink, and except for the fact that
twinkers often farm.  I don't really care for the fact that people have to
"compete" for equipment in the first place and I like it even less that the
player of a low-mid level character has to compete with a high level twinker
for the same item.

  I don't think twinking is too unbalancing, since the lower levels aren't
so difficult in the first place, even for non-twinked characters, if you
know what you're doing.  As noted, twinked characters often neglect the
invaluable opportunity the lower levels offer to boost some of the more
vital/secondary skills.  In the long run, it can catch up with them if
they're not careful.
