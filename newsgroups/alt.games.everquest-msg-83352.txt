Hmm, it depends on how much you are going to need to get access to evil 
cities.  Arolpin follows Bristlebane, as any good bard should, and has 
not had many faction problems because of it.  I have spent a good deal of 
time in Ogguk and Grobb, and except for the Shaman guild have no problem 
with my DE mask.  I was dubious to Neriak, but spending a day or two in 
there with a shaman killing people makes it so that I'm not very welcome 
anymore.  
If you really want to re-roll, go ahead, but I don't think that diety 
makes much of a difference to a bard from an effectiveness standpoint.  
You will not only be able to change your appearance, but also modify your 
faction (but only one faction group at a time) which should allow you to 
travel in just about any city other than cabilis.  A bard should be fun 
though, pick the diety you like, RP it to the max.  Make up new curses 
like, "By Bristlebane's Bloody Toejam!" and stuff.  
You're not an enchanter, thankfully, don't think you have to do 
everything like they do.  (Sheesh, they were skirts and meditate and 
other unhealthy habits.)
