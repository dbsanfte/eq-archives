 That sounds like an assumption to me. For one thing, I don't think
either of these two are set up as "raid zones". 

 Nobody is in Droga because it's poorly designed and the risk isn't
worth the rewards to those of the appropriate level to get xp there.

 These aren't "similar level" zones, either. Droga tops out at 35. The
top mobs in CoM... I'm not sure since it's been awhile since I've been
there. Definitely over 35. City of Mist is the place you go _after_
Droga starts to green out.

 The reason City of Mist raids are common is because a few classes have
epic components there. Before epics came along City of Mist would see
only a few groups. You'd have someone pulling to zone and you'd maybe
have a group on one side of the courtyard. That was about it.

 Basically I'm having trouble following you here. Are you saying Droga
would be more populated if the mobs were not soloable or what?
