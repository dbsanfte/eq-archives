It's 34, actually, when it first starts being viable.

Right.  Druids and wizards have no right to hunt in areas with
other players (unless they're grouped, of course.)

Right.  Druids and wizards don't need to level outside of groups
because "EQ is a group-based game."

Right.  Druids and wizards are the only people who train mobs, so
don't do it.

Right.  No one else ever trains a zone line.  When's the last time
you saw a group train a zone in KC, for instance, a zone where
druids and wizards can't quad?

Wow, actually mostly useful advice.  When testing to see if you have
the mana to quad a certain type of mob, try it on one but use your
AoE to kill it.  If you start to run out of mana, switch to a single
target spell and forget quadding those mobs until you're a higher
level (or deal with your mana pool in other ways.)

For pure practice in *how* to quad, just try four mobs of the same
type in a low-level outdoor zone.  Even quadding rats or bats in
Freeport will show you *how* to gather them up so your AoE hits
them.  Quadding something low-level that you can kill with two
nukes will show you how far you should run between nukes.  Other
than differences in run speed or aggro range, that's about it.
Quadding is incredibly simple.

Killing any blue mob is dangerous if you can't take getting hit...

Then you never got very good at it or you were trying the wrong
mobs.  Quadding is both simple and *VERY* much more mana efficient.
I'm guessing it will take me 100 kills to get through 47, for
instance.  That's 25 quads, each of which uses only 60% of my
mana pool (or less.)  I'll have to med up the equivalent of 15
times.  That's LOTS faster and more efficient than 100 single
kills, each of which takes about 25% of my mana (or roughly
about 25 mana bars to level.)  Given a choice of medding from
empty to full 15 times or doing so 25 times, I know which one
I'll take, not to mention the safety factor in ending each
quad with more mana available...
