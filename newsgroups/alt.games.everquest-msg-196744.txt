Yeah, I only use the Canni/iCH cycle between mobs.  After one too many 
times of mobs that are down to 5% or so root rotting in PoN, suddenly 
popping up to 40% or so health, root breaking, and finishing me off as I 
only have a couple hundred hp at that point.  I tackle mobs I know I can 
finish off without doing a Canni/iCH cycle, then, get mana back between 
mobs.
