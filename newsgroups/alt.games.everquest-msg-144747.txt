Well ill let you in on a secret :) Pretty much you and martin proved my
point anyway. There is a huge misconception that druids solo massively
better than anyone else. Many use this excuse to justify druids sucking ass
on raids . Looking at a revised analysis where warriors are doing half as
well as I stated before still means they are doing a damn fine job :) Lots
of both druids and warriors will be saying oops since the prevalent belief
is that druids can solo so much better than anyone else and warriors can
solo so much worse than anyone else that them being anywhere on the same
page will come as a revelation to many.

The grass is always greener over yonder, and many people only play one
class. Makes it tricky to argue convincingly when something really is
broken.
