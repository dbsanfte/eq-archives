	As I understand it, "draggro" is only implemented in certain zones.  I
don't think Wakening Lands is one of them.

	If you are in a draggro zone, and you drag ANY corpse other than your own,
mobs will agro.  It does not matter if the corpse is of a PC who is KOS in
that zone or not.

	Draggro zones also have limits on Summon Corpse; generally you can only
use it at the eastmost zone line.
