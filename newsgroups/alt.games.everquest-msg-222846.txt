    Rather than fix the supply problem by adding more to the game, we've
decided to convert some other dragon scale. Why stop there? Why not have the
NPC also convert Manastones into green dragon scales? Makes as much sense.

    Fire looked fixed last night. I've never seen less than full spawn in
Undead, so no idea what was happening there, but in Fire I've seen only two
adds pop from the boss.

    Which is pretty meaningless unless they also fixed the spawn in The
Hole.

    Yay, the newspaper is back! :-)

    This is what the Air rings were like before this change: there's four
islands in Air. One has elementals, one has spiders, one has phoenixes, and
one has those turkey-bee things. If you clear an island of all mobs (and
there's a fair number of them, they hit for close to 1000), then you get a
small group of tougher versions of the same mob to spawn. Kill those, and
you get a named version of that mob type with one elemental-level loot on
it. Kill that, and the Avatar of X spawns elsewhere in the zone and you can
go kill him. Simple, right?

    Not the way it was working.

    The rings respawned every 3 days, to the second. So if someone killed
one, they could lock it down and you'd never get it. Unless you knew when
the last one died, you'd have no idea if the Avatar was spawnable. If he
wasn't, you'd clear the island, kill the harder spawns, then get a PH with
no loot instead of the normal named version. So you'd waste a half hour
clearing the spawns, plus however long it took to gather and clear to an
island, only to find out you'd wasted your time. To add to the fun, the
Avatar of Smoke event only worked after a zone reset. After it had been
killed, it wouldn't respawn until the next zone reset. Given that you need
pieces off the Avatars to make the key to get to Xegony, this was very
annoying.

    Hopefully they'll make the same change to Earth A. It has four ring
events, and they have the exact same problems the Air rings had.

    Looks like the whining for separate LDoN Raid points and vendors has
produced some results!

    Anyone know what was messed up by this?

    Replace "could" with "would", delete "sometimes", and you have the real
extent of this bug. Not that most people minded Pick Pockets being broken.
;-)

    Mainly because other players had found a way to benefit from the bug.
There was a way to summon a pet who was a regular NPC, and who may or may
not have been KOS to the magician. There were ways to exploit creating
non-pet pets, like putting a KOS to all Air pet or two, or three, or 100 in
Paludal Caverns and letting the new players there "discover" them. If you
used post-60 pets, you even had a good chance of wiping out all the power
levellers in the zone at the same time.

    This was actually promoted as a "feature" during the Mage Best of the
Best tourney. How times change!

    Big nerf to bards, reducing the amount of mana bards can provide to a
raid significantly. Was an overdue change, though.

    About time.

    No more giant kitties? :-(

    Those two changes are nice.

    Yay, no more button-pressing for some of my alts!
