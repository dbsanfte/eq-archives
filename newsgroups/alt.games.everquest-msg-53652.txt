 Uh... huh? Perhaps the person needs to run 5 zones to loot his
corpse. Classes that can bind anywhere won't need this (unless 
they're stupid) but Melee classes sure as hell might want a SoW 
quite often since their Jboots and/or SoW potions would obviously 
be on thier corpse.
 
 "For a CR" is the #1 reason I buff/SoW/gate people. I mean, come 
on... are you just heartless or what? Have you never been in that
situation before or what? Or are you just an ass?
