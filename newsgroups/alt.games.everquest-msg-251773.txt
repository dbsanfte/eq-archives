You just don't get it, do you?  Throw enough CPUs into a machine, and
you can have petaflops.  BUT, unless the nature of what you're
modeling is highly parallizable, all the CPUs in the world won't do
you any good.

The fact that any given Cray X1 supercomputer CPU runs in the
gigaflops range, not the teraflops range, is just beyond you, isn't
it?

And I'll repeat myself again, hoping that this time you'll understand:
It doesn't matter how many CPUs they pack in, if the problem you're
tackling isn't highly parallizable, all those extra CPUs *won't do you
any good*.

Do your own web search, but try harder this time.

I'm talking about high-end x86-based PCs.

I'm not talking about SGI workstations.

Show me the link that proves you can plug high-end nVidia and ATI
graphics cards into Cray X1 supercomputers, and I'll concede the point
that you'd need to emulate the graphics card.

Oh my god, you still don't get it.  You're about as sharp as a hammer.

The point is that emulators introduce a bunch of overhead.  It doesn't
matter if you're emulating something on your TI-99/4A or your Cray X1
supercomputer: If you're *emulating*, you're incurring *overhead*.
And lots of it.

I'm saying you're a fucking idiot.  Read those web pages more
carefully, you dull witted baffoon.  Then read my comment more
carefully.  I was discussing the speed of any given CPU in the
machine, not adding them all together.

Of course it "can be done".  And theoretically, you can achieve a 4th
grade level of reading comprehension some day.

Idiot.

Cray CPUs do not run in the teraflops range.  Repeat it to yourself
over and over until you understand.

Idiot.  Idiot.  Idiot.
