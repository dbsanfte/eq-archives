  Because Verant was unable to program their creatures with perfect AI,
"human intelligence" is able to devise certain techniques and strategies by
observing mob pathing and their habits and limitations, enabling us, in some
circumstances, to kill them with little or not risk.  Allowing creatures to
hit through walls is one way in which Verant compensates for this weakness
creatures have.  Also, mobs can hit you regardless of vertical distance.  If
you're in a multi-story dungeon, like, say, Unrest, it's possible to be on
the downstairs floor and get hit by an upstairs mob if they're right on top
of you.

  It is annoying, and ideally it shouldn't be necessary, but even WITH these
advantages, exploits have still popped up here and there enabling people to
fight mobs without risk.  So it's pretty much a necessary evil.  Be aware of
it and watch out.
