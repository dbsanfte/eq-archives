In this particular case, the person who owns the website has said that the
hosting company has not been charging her for hosting it.  She has made
payments to them out of the donations, in order to defray their costs.  She
also is the one who personally verifies the information on her website, and
as such, needs to be able to travel to Luclin, so you can look at that as
merely another cost of maintaining the information on the website.
