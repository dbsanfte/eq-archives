Is there a site that documents the history of Everquest through all the 
expansion packs from a purely numerical viewpoint? Nothing having to do 
with the story line.

Things like:

The 'ideal' experience group during the various expansions and why.
The top damage per second, hitpoints, equip, etc of the various classes 
for each expansion.
The natural progression of mobs a raiding guild goes through.
Or why someone is able to go back to a previous expansion's raid level 
mob and solo it once a new expansion comes out.
