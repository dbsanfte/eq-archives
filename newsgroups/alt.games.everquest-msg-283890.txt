Fizzling is a totally different animal than being interrupted.

Being interrupted *never* costs mana -- whether it's from being stunned,
moving, or ducking. Fizzling *always* costs mana. I seem to recall it's a
random amount of mana -- 10-50% of the fizzled spell's cost. It's a
difficult thing to test efficiently, and I'm a sucky googler and sucky
number cruncher, so please take the percentages with a large grain of salt.

And, for what it's worth, all the casters (except Bard) work with the same
game mechanics: Cleric, Druid, Shaman; Magician, Enchanter, Wizard,
Necromancer; Ranger, Paladin, Shadowknight, Beastlord. How the mechanics
work for one class is how they work for the others.

Bard class, as usual, follows it's own bizarro set of rules. I couldn't
tell you offhand what happens when a bard fizzles (aka, "misses a note")
on one of the few songs that actually costs mana. When I'm playing a bard,
there's far too much going on for me to notice that kind of minutiae :)
