I played my bard long, LONG ago - but...........

Using hotkeys has always helped me defeat lag,
and was always the recommendation of the greats
on EQ-Bards mailing list.

Also, now that you can do pauses in socials, you
can make the hot keys single key taps.

/pause 3, /stopsong
/cast #

you adjust the pause until you never get the
not recovered message.

Now that you can cast spells directly from
the keyboard, the original way I did it is
even easier, and takes no hotkey slots.

I have my spells casting on the top row numbers,
or Ctrl+Numpad Numbers, my hotkeys are on the
numpad.

If I were playing a bard today, I think I'd
use 6 hotkey slots for instrument swapping
spots, and the top row numbers for song weaving.
