Dunno if it's for real or not. I went to the link and loaded up the page. It
plays a short movie then you need to log in. I couldn't get any further. Looks
real enough on the face of it but you'll have to log in using the email address
they sent your invitation to and the password supplied to see what other
information there is there.
