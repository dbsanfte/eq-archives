Yeah, my Vah Shir Beastlord is level 23 with about a day played; a lot of
which is running around.  We hit level 10 the second day we played, level 20
after 4 or 5 days (each day playing for maybe 2-4 hours).  We're slightly
twinked as we're wearing mainly stuff that dropped off the fungoids (which
we got with our higher level chars) and carrying hand-me-down weapons, but
none of it is near uber.

I used to know where to go, but Luclin changed just about everything for me.
We did the newbie area until about 6 and then Paludal until 22.  We tried
LOIO (where the best exp used to be for our current level), but then we went
and tried Marus Seru and the experience is MUCH better there.  We'll
probably also try Overthere as usual, but end up in Dawnshroud or something.

It's nice because we're really getting to know Luclin.

That's exactly my thinking.  Not having to pass down my FBSS and my wisdom
gear gave me a lot more pride in my Beastlord.  It's been a lot of fun.  We
(my wife and I) had basically quit EQ until McQuaid left and the changes of
March 19th were instituted.  Since then, it's been like an entirely new game
for us.  I actually feel like Verant isn't taking some sort of sick pleasure
in making us miserable in the game!
