I would attribute that to luck - heh, something of which I guess I lack
sometimes. Channeling is an odd skill. There have been times where Orc Pawns
have got a lucky hit in on me and interrupted my casting, and there have
also been times where I had tons of orcs in CC beating on me and still got
FD off. (In my mid 30's that was one hell of an accomplishment)

So relying on a FD with a cast time is like playing Russian Roulette...
you'll get lucky a few times, but eventually death -will- find you. Now
that's not to imply that any FD is fail-proof, as there are many things that
can go wrong with a SKs and even Monk's FD... however, a Monk's FD has less
variables that need to be considered for success.

Heh, sometimes it's interesting to hear of the things that some people do
before dying. I suppose the most bitter would say something along the lines
of, "If I hadn't tried to live, the result would have been the same as what
I just attempted."
