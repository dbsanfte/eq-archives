Seems you're definitely in the minority there. LoY and LDoN have both
had some of the best changes ever to happen to EQ (By the way, the
gripe about them "copying" features of other games is absurd, given
that it's pretty standard practice in the industry to apply ideas from
each other in games. I bet you think Blizzard invented the idea of
socketted/slotted items, right?). 

I've never had a single problem with CS (Though, I don't deny that
others have). If anything, it's improved since Verant was dropped.

Time sinks have actually improved -- travel is DEFINATELY a lot less
painful, but that's kinda good and bad.

"Needless nerfing of classes" is nothing different from when Verant
was at the helm.

Overall, the game has improved tremendously since throwing out that
ridiculous "Vision" that the original developers have. All it did was
handicap game growth and the players.
