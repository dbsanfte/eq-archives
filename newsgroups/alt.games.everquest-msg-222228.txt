I don't pay anything to Alla and I can view quests. Casters
Realm also has some listed. But, to answer your question, I
grew up in Surefall/Qeynos Hills/Blackburrow and there are
some quests there (not ranger only) that are doable at 15.
Once you're up higher in level, there is always the ivy-etched
quests. Those start in Kithicor.
