Rangers get it at 17

No. I currently wield a Piercer and a 1HS, then a 1HB and open hand when Mob
breaks.

Why? Aren't fists a Monk's best weapons - at least at lower levels and
untwinked? I have only taken mine to 13, but I fight H-to-H until she maxes
at each level, then switch to 1HB, and if that maxes before next level then
switch to 2HB. But I always switch back to H-to-H after levelling.
