I am getting SOOOO tired of buf/sow/port/PL beggers.

I dont mind to sow people if they come up to me and ask, will even sow
if its only a "sow plz" and nothing else. But im getting SOOOOO tired fo
all the idiots, especially in WFP, that just do a /who DRUID and then
ask for sow/buffs, and expect me to drop all im doing and run to the
other end of the zone to help them.
Have even had an idiot asking me for sow in EFP while i saw smithing and
doing turns on the forge with 3 other players. When i said i didnt have
time he offered 10pp. When i said i still didt hav time i got told to
BEEEP myself, and then came on his ignore list.

Now im staring to tell people that beg that if they can find me they can
get sow/buffs, and when they ask where i am i tell them im tired of
beggers, so they must find me themselves if they want sow/buffs.

Dont that sound like a ok solution to the problem?
Another solution could be to go /roleplay, but since DO want people to
see im a druid, so i can help with wolf form to the KOS people in NFP,
and the occasional port for a CR that is not an option.


Same for ports. I sat in GFay the other night and watched a druid get
flamed for shouting out that he was porting for 10pp, 4 people started
flaming him. And not newbies, we were talking 40+ chars. Have we really
come to the point where people think that all we druids are made for is
taxi/sow/buff machines? I mean, every time someone want a port we need
to mezz the port (around 10 sec), med up if we dotn have mana for it,
wait for him to show up, port (1 min on my old machine, slow zoner), med
the 300 mana back up, port back to where we were (sometimes we druids
are actually bound where we hunt, and cant just cast bind whereever we
want, because its a 20 min run back to hunting place from nearest port
place).
Lets take NFP as example. When im sellign there i get asked to port
around every 15 min or so. If i should port these people, even if they
are paying for it, i would user 1200 mana (take around 5 min to get up),
waiting for them (lets say 2 min, NFP is small), zoning (4 min on my
comp), zoning back to WC (4 more min), running from WC to NPF (around 20
min running time, 12 min zoning). Thats 47 min, 47 min out of 60 min, i
would have to leave my trades, for what is if im lucky 80pp.
I mean, have been trying to sow for donations. Wanna know how much i
earned in 90 min? 20pp. 10 people payed me, rest told me, AFTER porting
that they had no money.
Have even had a guy wanting me to leave a group and come and port him
for free. When i told him no i was told that "its only mana". No, its
not only mana, its leaving all you are doing for a period of at least a
few min, and if you are in a group you cannot do that.
Was REALLY tempted to port that guy to Toxx and leave him there.


And its even worse with PLing, whats up with people today? Yesterday a
guy in EC asked me to PL him for free, and after having said no to him
SIX times he started begging me for buffs. Guy not even being in
tracking range of course.


Am I the only druid that feels like that out there?
