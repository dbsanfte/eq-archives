I have been trying to use it on Xev as well. I cant believe that there 
would be only a few people with the LoY expansion on Xev. However no one 
seems to want to use the tool. I have found with alot of Xev people that 
they are all a little paraniod about 'pickup groups' and just stick to 
their guild groups. Its a bit pants and antisocial in my view because i 
think that they are wasting a good tool.
