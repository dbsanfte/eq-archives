20 seconds.
The dragon ring tooths are on 20 second spawn timer.  They are also
supersets of each other.  If you get the WL tooth, you don't need the
GD tooth to port to GD.  If you get the CS tooth, you can port to all
three rings without any other tooth.

Just bug someone with a Skyshrine key, invis up, lev up, sow up and
run like a mofo to the CS dragon ring, loot and try and get out.

If you die, big deal the tooth is soulbound.  My level 1 ogre mule has
a CS dragon ring tooth...don't ask why, I was VERY bored one night.
