I have been to the Safehouse a number of times, but most of the information
there is for much higher level players.  I have not been able to find the
answers to my specific questions there.

This morning I decided to post my questions, but I was unable to create and
account.  The page kept timing out.

Anyway, if you have any other suggestions, I sure would appreciate it.
