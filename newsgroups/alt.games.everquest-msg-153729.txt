He knew this, he just didn't realize that MB isn't useful because its
a way to deliver tons of highly efficient damage, but because
its a way to deliver tons of inefficient damage overwhelmingly
fast.

He thought that a MB rotation would make sense, with each wizard
firing off (say one per minute) to up the damage rate against
high HP mobs.

Sadly, MB might be useful for small group tactics now, to drop
single target highly annoying mobs by overwhelming their HP
total fast, but MB will no longer scale up, so that many MB
wizards are for a large mob what one MB wizard is for
a smaller mob.

Post change, wizards will have to go back to regular spell
based damage, increasing their efficiency but forcing them
to take longer to make the kill.  This is, of course, time in
which the mob will be chewing up the tanks.  With Mod
Rod nerf happening in tandem, clerics will no longer be
able to keep tanks alive indefinately, so the absence of
MB from the options list will be particularly palpable.

VI -claims- that they will also be retuning mobs so that
they have significantly less HP, since infinite healing and
instant overwhelming damage are no longer options.  Of
course whether they mean all mobs that previously
raids used these tactics on, or just three or four really
really high end mobs, is anybody's guess.
