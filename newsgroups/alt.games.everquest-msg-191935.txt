I didn't infer that people with "in-game" names were better. I merely
pointed out the fact that they have to put forth effort to build a
reputation (good or bad). 

Someone with a silly/stupid/vulgar/etc name only has to log in to get
noticed (good or bad).

The point is that anyone can roll up a non-compliant name in EQ. Very
few can actually build up a reputation server-wide through force of
personality and the actions/choices they make in-game. 

If you pick 1000 EQ players at random, then sort them by
griefers/trouble-makers and average/above-average players. Which group
do you think will have the most non-compliant names?
