Hill Giants are difficult for their level, but drop nice loot for their
level.  This is a balanced risk versus reward.

Whats broken is that harder mobs don't drop any more loot than
this, in fact most drop less.  So instead of moving up to Frost
Giant Elites, if you want money, you stay on Hill Giants, which
you can drop twice as many per hour and get twice the average
loot per each... four times the drop rate and far less risk.

I suppose the problem is that in the pre kunark era, Hill Giants
were near the high end of huntable mobs, hard for their level,
and trivial to noone.  With Kunark came higher levels, who
could slaughter hills trivially, and better equipement (a  trend
continuing with each expansion) so that even the 40 to 50
players could more readily farm HG.  But no mobs were introduced
that drop more than an average of 15pp each (well, a few
but nothing that pops regularly so you can do kills per hour),
so HG farming became the lazy man's way to make PP fast.
