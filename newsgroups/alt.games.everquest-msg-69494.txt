I agree with what Lance wrote ("as a druid, melee isn't your strong suit"), but
when soloing, I make the most of it.  I'm suprised at how much damage I *can*
do with a 1hb (plus I tend to proc a lot--smouldering brand), so this is my
method.

Find critter.  Put damage shield on self.  Open with snare.  DoT (ALWAYS DoT).
If you still have time, land a good nuke on them, and proceed to melee as
needed.  Keep snare up.  Never pick on anything your size or larger, and try to
find things that'll turn to run once they get low.  And beware of social
agro--such as fighting centaurs near the centaur village in SK.

Doing this, I rarely get below half mana or half health, at least not for long,
so long as I'm careful.  With the right mobs, I can stay at 60% or higher most
of the time.  I solo'd teens to early/mid 20's in the OT, spent a little time
in Swamp Of No Hope and Lake Of Ill Omen, and now I'm in SK at 27, and will be
going between there and SONH for a while.

Please note that your milage may vary, and that when you are grouped, DON'T
MELEE.  MED.  If you're FM and everyone is buffed, sure, melee and have fun,
but only then.  I've died (as a tank) more times than I care to think about to
Druids who decided their 30 points of damage every 4-5 seconds was more
important than giving me that nice, juicy heal...
