I used to be able to cruise around PoK with 150 people in the zone and
far clip at 80% without much lag.  Most zones had minimal or no lag.
Now since LDoN, if there's even 7 or 8 people in the near vicinity, I
get major lag in all zones...  Is anyone else having this problem or
is it just me?  I'm on E'ci and the problem seems worse in the evening
where sometimes there might be a 3 second delay between doing
something like casting a spell and it actually starting to cast.  Also
everything shadowsteps like crazy and zoning can take a long time.  Is
the problem on my end or did SOE overload the servers with LDoN?

Here's my specs.

Windows XP Pro
1.5GHz P4
768MB DDR RAM
Geforce 4MX 440
160GB 7200RPM HDD 
512kbps DSL

I run at 1024x768 with 32bit color.
