Though they may push it out early (can anyone say SWG?) I hardly think it 
will cause any risk of a premature death for the game.

That is more of a concern for many. EQLive has already gotten to the point 
where if you want to see all the bells and whistles, even a top end machine

pushing the limits even further.
