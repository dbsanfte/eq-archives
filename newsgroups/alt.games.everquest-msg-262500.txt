Kitten, I don't care about your situation one little bit.  The fact is that you said...

>If you use a wireless network do not install SP2.

...and I called you on that sensationalist bullshit.  It is what it is, utter bullshit.

Wait, Kitten, I'm not done with you yet.  Regarding your abstract "most of us" comment: I
call bullshit there, also.

I challenge you to defend your position using absolute terms.  Give us numbers,
percentages, references - anything concrete.

I wonder...will you post another bullshit response, or will you research the facts and set
me straight (if I'm wrong), or admit that you're wrong, or will you just be a lazy fuck
and plonk me?

> Don;t let facts stop you from making one word nonsense posts though.

Hooey.  Apparently you managed to make enough sense out of my post to be offended by it.
