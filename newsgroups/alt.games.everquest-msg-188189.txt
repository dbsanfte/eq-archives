If you aren't already using http://www.tinkering.org you should go there 
and check it out.  They may have forums there that will interest you along 
with being an overall great resource for Tinkering.

If you don't mind chat channels, join this one:

serverwide.tinker  ( maybe serverwide.tinkering, can't remember )

The people there are pretty good about answering questions in between the 
standard crap you get on all channels.
