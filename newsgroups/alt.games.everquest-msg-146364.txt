Bah, I don't like this change.  For anyone under 60, the more xp
they moved from 51-59 into level 60 made it that much easier to 
get to 60.  Ah well.  I'm still looking forward to trying out DN
again with my regular group.  It was a blast the other day, especially
the dragon constructs (blue to yellow to me at 55), but the XP
was crap (pre-patch), maybe now it'll be decent xp and a shot at
decent loot.
