very true, but I got really lucky with the AC in OOT..spawned after 2
hours...
so I was able to get my Journeyman's Boots in about 3 hours total
it would take me much longer than that to save up 5250pp
in other words, for me, it doesn't matter. I've got what I consider to be
the better item of the two.

but the Traveler's boots are definitely a good option for someone who
doesn't want to camp the AC for god knows how long...if I hadn't been able
to get my Journeyman's boots, you can bet I'd be working my hardest to get
the Traveler's boots
