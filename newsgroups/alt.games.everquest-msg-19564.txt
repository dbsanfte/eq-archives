No data on GMs.  But back in March, I was an apprentice guide for about a
month.  It was making the game seem more like work, so I stopped.

There was a policy in place for guides forbidding them from identifying
themselves as guides when on their play characters.

Since GMs are actual Verant employees, the rules may be different.

I don't think the guide/GM policies and procedures are published anywhere.
