While I haven't done this with the JBoots, I've certainly done it any
number
of times with other quests.. in fact there was one quest in FP where you
need to hand in two of a lore item, where I handed in one, went out and
got another and came back and handed the second in about half an hour
later, after zoning several times and crashing to desktop once... the
only hitch here is that someone -could- give the gold to Hasten after you
hand in ring and rapier and get the reward... or the game could crash,
resetting Hasten, in that little interval...
