What class (or race, heck, let's have fun with
> this!) currently has the rep of having the fewest jerks?

I dunno, but in my experience (admittedly short) I have added about 8 people
(yes just 8) to my list of complete and total assholes. Keep in mind, these
are the worst of the worst, not the moderately foul, but the truly
unrepentant.  Of the 8 three are monks and three are paladins.  Yes,
paladins! didn't see them mentioned here.  Half of this group were Iksars.
I have had a lot of problem with Iksars.

Now who are least likely to be jerks? Well, noone said anything bad about
rogues (in fact they seem to have been overlooked altogether).  But, being
that rogues are really dependent on other classes for grouping etc... don't
have anything that anyone else wants (sow, clarity, porting ability etc...)
and can't solo worth shit so they are not likely to KS anyone, my vote goes
for rogues.   Of course my opinion has nothing to do with the fact that I
play a rogue.

I also play a shaman, so it was nice to hear that shamans have a good rep.
