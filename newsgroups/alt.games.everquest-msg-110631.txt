   You are, of course, free to assign any meaning to my
words that you which.  We all have our hot buttons.  I, for
example, am sensitive about my weight.  If someone were to
me compare to, say, a pre-diet Oprah, I would take this
harder than someone else might.  But that really has little
bearing on this issue.  If you make extremist, sweeping
statements, them you are fair game, imo, to be compared
historical figures that sought to impose their mores on
society.
   But sure, what the fuck.  Let's just say that I'm not
nearly smart enough to see why you might not like the
comparison.  Call yourself a winner, in this case.  Just
know that I'll consider to say whatever I want, about
whomever I want, and not really care if it bothers you or
not.
