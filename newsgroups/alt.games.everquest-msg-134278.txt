Ok then add a trojan to your server which tunnels protocols and you will 
see how fast your machine is open, or even worse simply open the port for 
a server. What you describe can be achieved by closing the netbios port, 
adding the latest security patches to xp and disabling running server 
services or restricting them to localhost access, as well. What ZA 
basically does is that it can block certain applications to get out, but 
if you unblock the app you run the risk that somebody digs into your 
computer, over tunneling securty flaws etc... The worse is even if your 
TCPIP stack is altered than basically even the most basic functions ZA 
performs are rendered useless.
