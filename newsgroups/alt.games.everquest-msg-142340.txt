The whole point of the discussion is stemming from whether or not they
should be granted a spell, which is game mechanics. The relative
closeness of the classes to clerics is being used to claim that
paladins should get the "CHeal-ish" spell, too.

You clearly misunderstood what the quoted statement was saying, then.
No surprise, given who I'm talking to. Not implying that you are
incapable, just obviously unwilling. The IC view of Shamans/Druids not
being closely related to Clerics is from a standpoint that is biased.
Their TRUE closeness cannot be determined from that standpoint. Just
because IC'ly, a cleric may not see a shaman as a "valid priest"
doesn't mean that game mechanics-wise, they should not be treated as
such. Thus, the IC point of view is irrelevant. The only view that
matters when determining game mechanics is one that's free of the IC
social biases.
