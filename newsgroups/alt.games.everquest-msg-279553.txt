Yes, as you noticed, that's what I was referring to.  Then there's
Anarchy Online, Ultima Online, Knight Online, Guild Wars, all of which
people froth about in their ex-favourite-MMORPG's newsgroup.
Honestly, if people would just shut the hell up and let people make
their own mind's up, it would be so much less irritating.  It gets
wearing over the decades when you've seen frothers in action over and
over again.

Well, I have this picture in my mind - when he saw the words
"Everquest" and "best" in the same post, his knee must have jerked so
hard it cracked his chin  :D  Pity for him it referred to the ARTICLE!
