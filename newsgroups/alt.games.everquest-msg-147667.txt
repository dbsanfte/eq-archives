No way you're going to solo in Mistmoore. By the level that you can without
dying 5 min later, you won't be interested in Lambent.

Frankly, at 37 I would suggest pursuing the Twighlight armor quests or
saving your money to by singing. That said, the BP is the one piece of
Lambent that might still be worth pursuing at your level. Depends on what
server you're on as to whether you're going to find a group down in LGuk or
not near what you need, but the Basalt are around in a lot of places, so, if
there's a group down there, you have a chance.

Mistmoore will usually have groups, but may not have one in your level and
not capable of holding the room you need to hold (which can become rather
hot and busy - last time I was there we had a major wipeout with toons
ranging from 35-52. Someone trained half the castle on us, but that happens
with some frequency in MM). Basically, I would suggest asking your guild for
some help. You need to take the onus of catching up with your guild some,
but they should be willing to pop in and help you get there sometimes or
you're probably with the wrong guild IMHO.
