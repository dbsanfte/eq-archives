The Guildwars FAQ athttp://www.guildwars.com/faq/default.html says:
"Am I required to buy the new chapters in order to continue to play
Guild Wars?
No. Every purchase you make in the continuation of the Guild Wars saga
will be your choice. If you purchase new chapters, you will gain
access to new regions of the world, new skills and abilities, new
items, new professions, and much more. And of course such a purchase
will support the continued development of the game. However, if you
choose not to purchase a chapter, you will still be able to play the
chapters of Guild Wars that you own, and you will have common areas in
which you will be able to play with and against your friends who have
purchased the other chapter(s)."
