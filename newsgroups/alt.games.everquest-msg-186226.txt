I had the same mouse and it worked great until I got in game, then the 
wheel would not work. I tried the patch and updates, still nothing. 
Finally, I took it back to the store, told them it didnt work and 
exchanged it for the Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer. Have had 
absolutely no problems with it. I've had several Logitec mice and all 
have had some issue or another, was a loyal follower untill this issue 
turned up. If you want mice that work with all applications on a PC that 
is Microsoft based, get a Microsoft mouse.
