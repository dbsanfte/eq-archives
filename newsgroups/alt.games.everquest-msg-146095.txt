So lets see. Imagine a situation where an exp group has warrior, shaman, 
and a monk. They would like to get another melee damage dealer. Cleric 
and warrior come along. Cleric is much more likely to get the melee 
damage dealer spot than warrior in this case. Because they already have 
a sponge, and the second cleric will do same or more damage as a 
warrior, AND will be able to heal/rez if need be
