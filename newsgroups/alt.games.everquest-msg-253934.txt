Well, at 17 I've still got a cap of 20, but I have seen some triples, my 
skill is 69 at the moment.  I don't get skill ups often on it, but at 
one point I got two skill ups with one button press (double frenzy, each 
  with a skill up), very amusing.

No idea what the damage progression is based on yet, since it seems to 
have been above my damage cap since getting it at level 6.  I'm guessing 
the double and triple thing (on Allakazam I saw some indication that 
triple is the most you'll get) is skill based, seems to happen more now 
that my skill is higher.
