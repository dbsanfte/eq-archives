yeah your com files are messed up. I've heard of it happening with
some zones but it especially seems to happen there.

IF you can log in another char somewhere else:

1) Delete all cityofmist* files in your eq dir.
(Move them first to another DIR in case that causes a problem

2) run the kunark patcher when starting up the patcher as well.

If you can't log in any chars or still that main one, or if the above
does not work or as an alternative, run the thorough file check
patcher. I think you just hit that button after it patches "thorough
file check." 

Something is likely corrupted.
