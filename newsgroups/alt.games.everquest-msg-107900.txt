Yep, you are non kos in the first part of the temple of veeshan, which
is nice. It makes casually going into the start of the halls of
testing for dragon quest armor drops easy. They get kos to you there.
For the most part you are also non kos from the dragons in West
wastes, though at least on is on the gorenaire type ring of scale
faction. You can just casually walk under sontalek on the way to tov
while the kael armor people have to train it out or run for it.

I think dragons are far better for this and other reasons. My goofy
guild is switching to giant though now, you kind of do eventually I
guess. It sort of makes sense since for the most part the people
wanting the better stats from the skyshrine armor (such as
casters/druids etc) have got most of it by now. It will be sort of fun
though and there are some very good giant quests (some like coldain
boots and gloves are farmable with 3 or less people) I already got my
scout range slot quest item on my druid so I don't care about dragon
faction now really, bahhaa. I've still not tried to raise giant much
though since I'm not in a hurry to be kos by woushi.

Main reason the guild is switching is we are at the sleeper's tomb key
getting stage where its just a lot easier if you switch to open season
on all possible dropping dragons. We've killed that sontalak guy who
always loved me so.. many tears.
