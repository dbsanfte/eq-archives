Since you all so cheerfully loved the first one, here's some more.
Most of this is shamelessly stolen from Steelwarriors.



    * AA requirements for being able to level in Omens were called
"rumors".
    * They are going to pick a raid number and stay with it. (Got the
feeling it would be 54).
    * OOW will only have a very small number (I was told 1) of locked
zones. The end encounters will be locked, but anyone will be free to
go into the zone.
    * Boots of Despair - The taunt mod does work for us.
    * Inspect Buffs Leader AA should show your own buff timers as
well.
    * There are new armor sets coming to ldon which will be
elemental-calibre. The price cap at 1452 will be raised, to what I
don't know.
    * You will be able to remove your augments from your armor soon.
    * Some GoD spells will be available via quest.
    * They are considering outsourcing the artwork to an outside
company so they're more free to work on content, while still having
unique models. I believe they said PoP was outsourced, for example.
    * Veeshans Peak revamp is coming very soon. When I asked if the
old key would be needed, I was told: "You take the old key, and some
new stuff, and make the new key -- then you get a reward for your old
key."
    * The Customer service system is being improved (And has improved)
quite a bit.
    * Lots of talk of improving LDON for the more casual or smaller
numbered raiders. Creating an alternate progression path to elemental
-> time.
    * They seem to want to instance most/all progression targets. This
is good.
    * Guild Banking seems to be on the way.
    * Brenlo wants a halfling bard.
    * Hobart asked about any interest in an in-game DKP client
    * New animations at the end of the year..along with that is
possible new race/class combinations (not new races/classes, just new
combo's)
    * Shaun Lord who worked on PoP was added back to the EQ Live team
this weekend (that's a good thing)
    * The average eq player between levels 30- 50.
    * Eq is NT based.
    * BiC quest pieces off Primals will be changed.
    * Ikkinz trials are being changed a bit - for knight
survivability.



That was all raised in the development meetings. We also had a
customer service meeting though, which went pretty well.


    * There will be a GM Graveyard Shift soon
    * A new tool is available to the GM staff, CS Assist. This
increases their efficiency quite a bit.
    * As part of CS Assist, GM's can do a few new things. They can
leave you persistant messages - Meaning you can logout, and tomorrow
you'll log in to an answered petition. Going along with that, they can
reimburse items to off-line accounts.
    * The Guide program will be changing directions a little bit.
They'll be primarily responsible for running events and roleplay
quests throughout the game, and will help with smaller petitions if
needbe. This should increase the number of GM events and random events
happening ingame around you.

"Bad enough when the dead come walking," he said to Jon as they crossed
 the village, "now the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will
 come of *that*, I'll warrant. And who's to say the bones wouldn't lie?
 Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely
 dull fellows, full of tedious complaints - 'the ground's too cold, my
 gravestone should be larger, why does *he* get more worms than I do....'"

- Dolorous Edd Tollett, "Clash of Kings" (George R R Martin)
