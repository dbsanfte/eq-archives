Well, I camped Raster for about 100+ hours in total. Yes, it was the most
tedious and boring time I have had in my EQ existance, but after he spawned
and my brain confirmed my eyes weren't deceiving me, I had the most
rewarding part of my EQ existance as well. I don't wish the camp on anyone,
but I can assure you that when you're about to loot the corpse, your heart
will be jumping out of your chest =)
