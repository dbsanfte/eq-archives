Man you have my sympathies. Friends don't let friends drink and drive
Trolls.  But look at the positive aspects of it:
 - the fact you came from a card game indicates you were out in the real
world. There is hope for some of us yet =)
 - the fact that those people stuckit out with you shows equal amounts of
pride and confidence in you (or maybe they were buzzin too)
 - a whole butt-load (sayin a lot for a Troll) of wisdom about proper force
for that particular mob.
Wisdom is a bitch of a teacher;  it gives the test before it teaches the
lesson.
Get some sleep. When ready, maybe go back with those hit hardest and grind
XP with em till they're caught back up.  Don't forget the handmade backpack
full of Dwarven Ale afterwards =)
