The water example is miles different. It's not like they're creating a
NEED for the "promo", then gouging for it. And there is still an
option to get into the beta without buying Lords of Warcraft... This
really isn't any different from any other promo offers. *shrug* Sure,
you can draw the line where you want, I just don't understand the
logic behind this. Just appears to be a sour grapes issue from my
perspective.
