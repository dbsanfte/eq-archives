I completly agree that the chances are high (VERY few non-evoc spells 
leave Miznit's hands) that evoc would (will) be the first to go over, but 
I have screwed myself over on some chars (deleted em) because of the high 
chance that I knew what I was doing...and didn't!

However, I have decided to train ALL of them, then start blasting my evoc 
above 50.

As a side note, anyone know a wizard that has chosen to excel in an area 
other than evoc?  Just curious.

Well, thanks again, and good day to all!

Miznit, Gnome Wizard of 20 lessons learned, E'Ci (but no last name yet)
