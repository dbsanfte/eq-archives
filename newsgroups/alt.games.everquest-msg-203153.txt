	Ah, but to the best of my recollection this "Videogames >
hollywood" quote relies on counting revenue of games INCLUDING console
hardware while only counting box office for movies.  Imagine if only
*game* sales were counted vs box office, pay per view, cable and other TV
deals, home video/DVD, rental video, all foreign income, and throw in 
the annual spending on projectors, lamps, and VCRs and DVD players too.
