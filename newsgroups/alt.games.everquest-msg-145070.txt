It's not germaine to most federal buildings.

Simply posting them as an acknowledgement of their impact on western law is
not "ramming it down people's throats."

It's obvious you wouldn't want to see the Ten Commandments displayed in
court, but have a care for those of us who would.  (it goes both ways)

You can make all the Ross Peroit witticisms you want, but that doesn't make
your statement so.  Acknowledging your sources is not an endorsement of any
kind.  Does posting them, in any way, make them enforceable?  Has any
legislature passed a law to require compliance with the Ten Commandments?
When was the last time anyone was convicted, in an American court, for
violating the first commandment?

I understand your being cautious about the idea of a state-supported
religion.  However, I'm also equally cautious about state-enforced
secularism.  I think displaying the Ten Commandments is actually a
middle-ground.  It recognizes the contributions to the legal system, without
doing anything enforceable.

There was never meant to be a great rift between church and state.  The idea
was never to keep the church out of the state's business, rather to keep the
state out of the business of the churches.
