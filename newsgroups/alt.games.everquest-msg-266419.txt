Who is to say we aren't also productive? Some of us do not share your weak
will and can lead a balanced life which includes moderate game playing. I do
a lot of webmastering and actually have to set aside time to play games as
my life in unbalanced with not enough recreation time in it.

As for going outside to look at the sun - well that is just stupid. You will
just damage your eyes.

Anyway - wheres Bizbee? Hopefully after he makes you cry again you will
vanish once more into the ether. In the meantime would you please give us a
demonstration on how pounding nails into your skull is productive?
Personally, I am of the opinion this may explain your obviously impaired
thought processes.
