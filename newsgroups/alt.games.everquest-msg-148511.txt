You want button pushing and combat tactics play a bard, those guys are
very very busy.  )

When my monk started taking things out solo, dark blues mind you, with
my bare hands..I felt like a monk. 

Sold a load of worthless weapons I just didn't need any longer because
of it...I really felt like a monk ) .
Although the cash is being saved for a T-staff, I aint crazy ;) Kept
one jade mace and one TE  War Maul that I can tote anywhere.

When I first learned to split mobs and understand agro and how to make
it work for me...I felt like a monk.

When I first realized I could go almost anywhere, and LIVE,..I felt
like a monk.

The first time I grouped with four other monks and saw how truly
destructive we are..I felt like a maonk among brothers. 
This is the melee equivalent to a wizzie AOE group..heh loved it. No
healer or buffs outside of clicky items and monk abilities. The mobs
dropped like flys that day, man it was beautiful, sniff sniff.

LoL and the first time I hit ID and OMG it worked!..on an unsnared
mob..DOH I felt like an arse..but we don't repeat those mistakes.

Heh there lots of it, we are truly a unique class, fun to play,
requires a LOT of skill, and has nice rewards for leveling unlike many
other melee classes I have played.

Im happy with what VI did here. Yeah I know that sounds strange coming
from me but VI does do a lot of things right and the monk class is
one. So if it aint broke for gawds sake please dont fix it ).

Heh anyone want to buy some knuckle dusters?
