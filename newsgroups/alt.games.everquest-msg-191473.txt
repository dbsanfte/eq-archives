None of the weapons with a Snare proc on that them are Warrior usable that I
know of will proc anywhere near lvl 16.

My advice would be to get a weapon with a decent dmg proc, instead, since
Froglok's have a starting dex of 100.

Get a Polished Granite Tomahawk, for the damage absorption and strength
boost proc. Should come in handy for soloing, or for groups where you're the
main tank and there's no healer. But make sure your Sta is over 100, or
it'll go down fast. I used one of these with a Warrior alt that I've since
deleted (he was Human, and I replaced him with a Barbarian), and it saved
his life a lot of times.

Once you get to lvl 20, consider getting a Wakazishi of the Frozen Skies,
and getting your Warrior's dex to at least 110 (115 if you can do it without
sacrificing too much Str or AC).
The sword only has dmg 6 and dly 22, but starting at lvl 20, it does a 80dd
proc (the Spirit Strike Shaman cold dd spell), and they sell fairly cheap.
If the sword procs AND crits at the same time, you're looking at some
serious dmg there.

I've got a lvl 14 Halfling Ranger with a dex of 112, and the Coldain Velium
Longsword he uses (with a Brightwood Spear used instead to train up Piercing
occasionally) procs a decent amount.

(The Ranger will dual wielding the CVLS and a Centi SS once he hits 17, then
the Centi SS and a WotFS once he hits 20)
