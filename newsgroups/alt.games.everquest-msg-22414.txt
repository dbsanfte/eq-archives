One cool thing about unrest is a group actually has to function like a
group, as opposed to everyone just attacking at random..  At about 18 or so,
you start to learn what the different classes can do, and what you should be
doing.  It's a great place to learn.   A good group can have a blast in
unrest.  You also get to blow up dead things with your undead spells.  Ah
the pretty blue lights.  Befallen's kind of boring, and a pain in the ass
for corpse runs.
    Highpass is fun too.  Its got some of the first easily campable cool
loot for your level.  The PGT and CDS rock.
