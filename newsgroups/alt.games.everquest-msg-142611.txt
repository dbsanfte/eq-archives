Ok, so it's your goal then.

Lose the cazicite shit, you'll end up paying WAY more than it's worth
because of rarity issues, same with a bunch of your CT loots.

Lose the kitty litter shield.

Lose the velium diamond rings (keep them for resist gear, but not everyday
wear, 6ac/65hp rings are better for that, or a Shadel ring)
