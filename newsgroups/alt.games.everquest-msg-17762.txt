The scene: The Pickclaw Guard Lounge in High Keep.
Two Pickclaw guards are shooting the breeze over a beer before going on duty.

"And so, Bob, there I was thinking about this line of work. I mean, everytime I pop into
the guard room to go on duty, there's this whole bunch of assholes standing there waiting
to beat me toa  bloody pulp!  And all this time, they've most always got this one, big,
nasty ugly guy with some harder than shit armor yelling stuff about my mother and
whatnot, and I'm always busting my claws off trying to hit him.  And yesterday, it just
hits me! I start thinking, wait a minute.......... who's that chap in the dress over
there with the funny looking stick. Usually the last thing I see is him waggling his
fingers around and then I have some huge bolt of lighting up my ass and I'm down for the
count. Hrmmm....... I bet I could clean *his* clock in about five seconds..............."
