My wood elf started with the same 95 str (I put 20 str and 5 sta) and
I believe her current strength is 118 without having +str earrings or
rings (yet). I am giving her gear ranked by AC, STR, STA rather than
AC, AC, AC. Just keep an extra eye on stats as well when you look for
gear, and you should manage.
