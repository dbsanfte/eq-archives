Sorry about the piggy back, miskeyed and lost the original post.

So, Jazz, were you this furious when they cut the death penalty in 
Half.  HALF I SAY, why, when I started it was far harder to get to
50.

What about the newfangled business of getting rid of the spellbook
at 35?  Why, most of the early level 50's had to see that all the
way to 50. 

What about when they instituted logging and reimbursement policies
for lost items.  At 16 on my first character I lost EVERYTHING due
to a bug.  I got NOTHING reimbursed due to the lack of these features.
Dangit, every newbie should lose everything at least once, just so
they know how I felt.

And don't even get me started on hybrids.  Why, in my day you paid
a 40% xp penalty, took a dis-proportionate share of xp in a group,
and were shunned by many groups as a result.  My bard was NOT 
welcome in groups with people who knew this back then. These new 
hybrids just don't know how lucky they are.

No corpse below level 10 = good, no newbie corpses littering areas,
less CS calls regarding the loss of items.

No spellbook = excellent, should have been done ages ago, not just
at 35.

Hell levels are being gotten rid of by making the xp curve smoother
from 1 to 50 see the quote on http://eq.castersrealm.com.

I've yet to see a change I think is a bad idea.  

BTW - switch to decaf bud, you're blood pressure will benefit :-P
