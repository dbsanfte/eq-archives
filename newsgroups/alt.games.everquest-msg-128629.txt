I really like the critical blast chance that Wizards have with their
offensive spells, it's exciting to see double damage and watch the mob die!

My question is this: What triggers the critical hit? Is it attribute based,
or level dependant? If based on levels, does anyone know what the rate of
change is for this ability?

TIA
