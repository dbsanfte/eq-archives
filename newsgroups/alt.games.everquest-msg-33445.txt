I've not seen one of these threads mentioned for a while...so thought I'd
post my few I've had recently.
Anybody else have any really stupid moves?

(early this morning)
In Najena, 80% HP (about 400HP), LV17 Barbarian Warrior. Fighting a
skeleton. Pulled him through a few more bone piles which jumped up and
joined in.  Then the Ogre spawned and decided to come along.  I got down to
2 skeletons, the ogre, and about 200 HP and thought I could keep fighting.
Corpse run...

(this afternoon)
LV17 Barbarian warrior. Was hunting in northern part of Lavastorm. I ran
into the fire goblin camp just outside Sol B where I had been buying bronze
armor.  I ran to escape them, knowing Sol B is nearby. I miscalculated and
ran into Sol A. Oh well, I'm safe either way. That is safe from anything
OTHER than myself.

to just peek over the edge {still side to side drunk motion}....OOPS!)

LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...

I think I'll keep my LV17 butt out of the higher LV dungeons for about 20
more levels before it becomes my LV16 butt.

Anybody else have stupid stories they've seen or done?
