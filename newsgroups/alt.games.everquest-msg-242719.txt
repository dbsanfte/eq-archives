Ok...tried the whole EQHOST.TXT thing...didn't work :(  Still getting
the 1001 Error message and cannot log in on any of the 4 accounts we
have.  Its been the same thing since we got up this morning and its
2:10pm PST now.  Will continue to check it and see if we can get in,
but something is seriously wrong with the log-in. *Sigh*  Not that this
is something we shouldn't expect from SOE...especially on the weekend
of the Fan Faire.  Too busy for those of us that really want to play.
