    The people getting hurt are your groupmates. Whether you care or not is
a different issue.

    If you feel bad about it, don't do it. And if you don't feel bad about
it and do it, make sure it's subtle enough that nobody's going to find out
if you value that reputation.

    Yup. Nasty rogues for doing that! Nasty! ...but they don't care. It's an
ability of their class, so they will use it whether you like it or not. You
can choose to not group with rogues, but then you start wondering why the
group with the rogues in it is killing so much faster than you, getting more
XP than you (and thus more cash for everyone), getting more item drops than
you, and progressing faster than you. I value my time more than I value the
cash loot off a mob - your mileage may vary.

    Some rogues like to think of PP as the price the group pays for the
higher XP/cash gain. I think those rogues are honest folk trying to justify
doing something dishonest to themselves. The real rogue kills fast, and
cashes in on the opportunities that presents.
