It is a long, long, long camp, but if you do it at 54-55ish, you can 
actually turn it into an exp camp.  With the new cyan mobs, there should 
be quite a bit in SolB that you can pull for exp.  I know that Fire 
Giants, bugs, and bats will give exp, and I would expect that some of the 
kobolds will too.
My guild actually looks forward to Ragefire camp weekends, because it's 
when we get to do all the silly stuff that you forget about in the daily 
grind.  We have train-pulling contests, naked drunken chariot races (put 
an iksar on auto-follow and yell ya mule a lot as he runs in circles), 
lava swimming contests, poetry slams, and other assorted madness.  Another 
good one is trick is to play Trivial Pursuit.  Have someone type in the 
questions, give points for the correct answers, give twink gear as 
prizes, that sort of stuff.
