Don't recall ever seeing the name here, but then again I'm running low
on brain cells. However, even if he really didn't give a rat's ass about
the actual question he posed, I decided to answer it. I, for one, really
appreciate the people who take a little extra time to craft questions,
comments, and responses using these sorts of conventions. It just makes
it easier for me to read if I can sort of "hear" the person speaking as
I read it. Flat, monotone text so often leaves people (including yours
truly) missing the point, or at least the emphasis of what the writer is
trying to get across. You're far from the only one who does it here,
though, fortunately. This is a pretty good group of writers, for the
greater part, who set the communications bar pretty high. (A few trolls,
top posters, idiots who can't find the punctuation and shift keys, etc.
excluded, of course.)

For some reason, over Sunday morning coffee, I felt compelled to ignore
the previous poster's obvious ignorance and point that out. Damned if I
can remember why now, though.
