    It was actually in response to a number of things including the Sol Ro
statement - let me quote some others for you.

    Roughly 100% of players do this during their lifetime. You've probably
done it yourself. Half the game's population treat hill giants as their
current source of income, or wish they could. The other half are 65 and can
farm all kinds of places.

    Now ah, I've never heard of anyone getting this guy flawlessly on their
first go. Maybe it happens, but im pretty sure almost everyone's had some
deaths at least once pulling him down. So what the fuck are you talking
about?

    The BP is equivalent to my guild's MT's current BP - or was last I
checked. We're not an uberguild but we are beginning to hit serious raid
targets. Once again this post shows you in one of two states:

    a) complete and utter ignorance of how anyone in a less-than-uber guild
functions
        or
    b) Complete cluelessness.

    Except that most people go through it to get there. What I object to is
that you make sweeping, arrogant remarks putting down all kinds of
achievement - I for one will never forget the first time my level 40
shadowknight with 1500pp worth of gear on him pulled down a hill giant
solo - from a position of either never really having shared their experience
and thus not knowing what you are talking about, or having shared it and
subsequently decided it was a worthless achievement.

    If you want to degrade your own achievements, well, what consenting
adults do in the privacy of their own home is their own business.
