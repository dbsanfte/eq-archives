Ive been playing around in Sro with my druid (track). Its interesting to
note, that without any tracksort, the most recently spawned mob appears at
the top of the tracking window (if it spawned while you were in zone). For a
zone that you just entered, the last spawn will be at the bottom.
The point of this, is that its easy to spot the placeholders when they are
hard to spot. For example in the FM cycle with the sw spawn of "a mountin
giant hillock", if you use tracking and have just killed the se spawn, then
the hillock ph will appear at the top.
Ive got a names coyote to spand just shortly after killing the undear in the
tower. Shorty after killing the named coyote, a got a spawn of "a giant
rattlesnake", which sounds pretty generic, but in fact was the only one i
could see on track. Killed it, shorty after a SG spawned. Interestin to note
also that the skelly that pops in the tower is not "dry bones skeleton", but
rather "a drybone skeleton"
Well I reckon that they are all ph's for the AC. Weve seen this in so many
other zones, where the rares are all on a cycle (or 2 cycles). Ive mentioned
fm. TT is another well known one for the forager/hunter cycles. Even the ac
in oot is on a rare cycle with ph's.
