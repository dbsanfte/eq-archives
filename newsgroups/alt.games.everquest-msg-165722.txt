If I can and they are not close to their haste cap I will always pure haste
rather than Augment ALL melee unless they specifically ask for it. Reason
being is that stuff dies faster, meaning xp is quicker. Rarely did I have a
problem with mana, especiallz hunting in zones with casters who you can just
drain.

Augment 43 - 45% haste, AC 17-18, Agi 33-35
AQ 64%haste

I would have thought that putting a lower haste on the MA would drop their
ability to keep agro, by how much I don't know.

used to augment myself for the AC :)

Cheers
