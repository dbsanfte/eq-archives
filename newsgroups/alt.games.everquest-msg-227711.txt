I dont remember where EP's drop anymore, havent even looted one for a while.
CoD isnt a very good zone to duo in IMO its too small and the Greater
Puslings cannot be slowed. Sooner or later one will spawn and get in your
way and you wont be able to kill it. Also I dont think the puslings are
really undead. The real undead are dangerously far in. HoH is a better place
to try duoing theres lots of room in the GY to kite. PoS frogs might be good
as well.

The only new zone that would be good for your duo would be ChardokB. In fact
it would be a great idea, I know 65 necros that solo there so you and your
Necro friend should be able to duo easy.

Since LDoN came out a nice ID4 belt was introduced, its like 10-20k though.
Dusty Girdle of Reformed Sand. There was a big plat scandal over the past
few months and prices on everything actually doubled so now isnt really a
good time to be buying.
