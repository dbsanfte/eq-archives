One of the reports said that the SWG universe was going to be huge: 7 or 8
worlds at launch, with each world as big as EQ.  If that is true, there
might be quite a few places to go without Wookies and Ewoks.

I wonder how fun it will be to explore?  Much depends on how death works,
and how easy or hard it is to avoid.  I've been doing some solo exporing in
Luclin in EQ and in the new expansion areas in DAoC, and it is a lot more
fun in DAoC, mainly because of the "sprint" ability.  As long as I don't
stumble into mobs that can kill me in two or three blows, I can usually get
away.  If I do die, not having to go back for my corpse is DAoC helps a lot,
too.  If SWG is like DAoC, in that death doesn't lead to potentially hours
of corpse recovery, and you have a good chance of avoiding it in the first
place, then exploring those 8 worlds could be a lot of fun.
