Pet was standing next to me in WFP. I had *just dinged lvl8 and I  was
at the gate chain casting Ward Undead (first Evoc spell in Necro
Line-up), and poison-bolt onto myself to work on bandaging. I couldn't
get F1 to toggle between myself and my pet, so I had to use external
view and click between.

I have to assume that something in my key setup got corrupted, I will
just have to nuke EQ and reinstall. Thank god I have a cable modem
hehehe :-).

Cheers

*This toon has been lying dormant for several months. when I say "Just
dinged" I mean that I dinged her to lvl8 back when F1 pet/me targeting
still worked for me hehehe.
