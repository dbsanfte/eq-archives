Face reality: Blood of wolf is a low end alchemy item and, as with every other
trade skill, there is little market for low end items, especially on an older
server like Xegony. My tailor lost huge amounts of money on her skill until she
was able to make tailored backpacks, and didn't see a profit until she was
selling imbued Vale (halfling cultural, very nice druid stuff) and DON'T get me
started on my smith and jeweler. Those are the cold, hard facts.

You will be able to sell SoW potions; I have several characters who use them
(bought off a guildmate.) But expect to loose money, and loose LOTS of money,
until you are at last two thirds of the way throught your skill. If you want
someone to bitch at, bitch at Verant.
