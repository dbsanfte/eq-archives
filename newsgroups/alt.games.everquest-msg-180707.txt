There you've nailed it!  These whiners want "Better Than Life"!  Of
course, then they'd whine about the drawbacks associated with that.

You're wasting your time with these guys Khosh.  I almost jumped
on mr. arrogant prick, but then I read the rest of his pathetic
attempt to flame you and realized it'd be pointless.  These guys
living in their little "it's all about me" imaginary worlds are
unable to see reason because they are unwilling to think.

As you pointed out, SOE obviously does "enough" testing.  This must
be true because they are still playing.  And coming here to whine
is pretty pointless (unless they're trolling), since there is
approximately zero chance that doing so will affect SOE's policies
and practices.  The only time you see SOE reacting to complaints is
when they are (1) numerous, and (2) actually directed at them.
