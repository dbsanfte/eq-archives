Bards can solo, in fact I'd think they'd rank much higher on the
solo scale than rangers.

Solo plans for bard:

1) Straight up melee.  Haste self, slow target, and pick between
HP regen, DOT, DS, DD, or some more obsure toys as your third song.
Unfortunately with no double attack skill bard melee damage gradually
lags behind the crowd... on the other hand a bard can wear -much-
better armor than your ranger.

2) Fear Kiting.  After you level up a bit, you will have the snare and
fear combination available, which lets you walk along behind a slowly
fleeing mob beating its unprotected back.  Its possible to run a third
song as above, although I find resist high enough that I'm usually sticking
to recasting one of the snare/fear.  Also the fear is AOE which means
you need to watch carefully for adds which may have been non-KOS
to you till you sang this song near them.

3) DOT/DD kiting.  Run around with the mob following you singing
various damaging songs.  Similar to Bow kiting, this can take a while
to accomplish, but you end fight undamaged and ready to go again,
as the songs you sing for it take no mana.  Unfortunately this doesn't
really become practical till 38+ when you have two good targetable
DOT songs... the DD song is pretty short range, and with a single
DOT killing takes forever.

4) Charm partner.  Instead of soloing the mob, make another mob
help you.  Simple plan is to leave charm running, which degrades your
melee output significantly but is relatively easy.  Harder is to twist
the charm in, swapping targets back to your pet when charm breaks.
You also take a beating each time charm breaks since your pet
is by necessity in melee range.  Can still be very effective, especially
with caster pets.

5) Charm Kiting.  Forget melee, have your pet do the fighting for
you.  This means you don't need to get hurt, stay out of reach and
back off when charm breaks.  Make sure you do at least one point
of damage to the target or your pet takes 75% of the exp.  Best
part of this plan is that your pet has been taking the melee damage...
so now you break charm and kill him one of the other ways, for
some -easy- exp.

6) Not a solo tactic per se, but run healsong while bandaging up
to half, then leave it running while looking for your next target...
downtime minimizers mean more kills per hour.  Rangers can
either heal -or- bandage to half, and then can heal further but
can't move while doing so, and then need to worry about
mana regen.

7) Also not a solo tactic per se, but bards do eventually get track.
Its a joke compared to ranger track, of course, but you will
regain some of the godlike ability to quickly and easily find
your next pull outdoors, or to see what nearby nameds might
be up underground.


Compared to Rangers, who have terrible AC for straight up melee,
can fear kite only animals, have to spend money to bow kite well,
and don't (AFAIK) have any access to charm, I think bards show
very well indeed as a solo class.

I do heartily reccomend getting a supply of SOW potions or better
yet JBoots or TBoots.  Selos is indeed far faster than SOW, but
singing it degrades your song output by 33%.  With J/Tboots on
you can use selo's to go find your prey then switch to slow (but
still faster than the mobs) gear while dealing with them.  SOW potions
you probably won't want to switch back and forth so much since
each time you cancel SOW you've spent about 10pp out of pocket.
