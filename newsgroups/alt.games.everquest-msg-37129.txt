You cannot guide on a server you play on. Your guide character is
different than your play character, and the equipment used is supplied
by Verant. Yes, they wander around while waiting for petitions, but they
usually don't spend much time waiting for them. 

No, they don't get to kill anything at will. They can only kill certain
things when the policy permits. They have to follow Policy for what they
can do, and cannot. GMs can do a lot more.
