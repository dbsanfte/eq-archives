Not sure 100% on the using of buffs as heal spells, they are probably
refering to the fact thata buff will add a certain ammount of
hitpoints to the recipients hit points. In turn if you cast it again
it will appear to HEAL the same ammount of hps. If you are casting
this buff I cant see how it would be efficient to a cleric.

Most likely they are refering to the Deepwater Helm used by paladins
to "hat heal" (with Daring i think). The helm has a buff (as I said
Daring I think) that can heal party members at no mana cost during
downtime.

So probably this does not apply to you.

Healing...

The trick to having mobs NOT beat on you is not to heal :) However
obviously you have to. When a tank pulls more than one mob, and you
start healing early for whatever reason, the mobs that the tanks are
NOT beating on will likely come to you.

Simply you just need to be ready for this. Have root up at all times.
Con the mob thats beating on you, if its red dont bother unless you
are desperate. Otherwise (blue or yellow mob) wander a little away and
try to root it.

DONT run about screaming get it off get it off. Tell the tanks whats
happenening and let them help you. Stand still and dont run, if you
run you will likely run AWAY from any help that might (should) come.

The very best way to manage the situation is to wait until at least
one of the mobs are dead and start healing when the tank has focussed
his attention on the second (or third) mob.

Sometime this doesnt happen. If the tank is going to die unless you
heal, be ready with divine aura, heal him as best you can and try to
root, and then pop Divine Aura as a last resort.

If DA gets off ok... move well away (if you can) from the mobs (they
usually go back to the tank) and be ready to gate when it drops.
Normally the mobs come straght back after DA drops.

btw I play a 34 Cleric of my own, and these are the things I have
picked up over the seasons. I also often play a friends 55 Cleric, as
well as my own main, a 55 Warrior, so I speak from a little experience
(not as much as some).
