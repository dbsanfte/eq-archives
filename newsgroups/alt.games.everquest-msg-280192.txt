Yes, actually it does. Generally venders are *obligated* to absorb 
errors like this. Be it honoring mismarked product on the shelf, or 
taking the lower price in discrepency between posted price and scan 
price at the till. (EVEN THOUGH the consumer may have put it in the 
shopping cart in acceptance of the higher price!!!) etc.

If SOE wants to cancel their own customers accounts over a mistake SOE 
made, let them. Does anybody really want to play EQ THAT badly? 

Hell, take the rest of the summer off and go to the beach. Sign up again 
in fall, your characters will all be there and you'll have the 
satisfaction of knowing that SOE lost more money on you than it made 
with its ridiculous move.
