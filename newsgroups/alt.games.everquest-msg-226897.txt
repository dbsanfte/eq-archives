Quoth Hamsterface:

> What about the druids you may say?

What about the Druids? Fuck the Druids. Even after four years of tasting 
the nerf bat, we're still a seriously overpowered class. It's not only 
that we can do so many things, but that we are *good* at so many things. 
We can solo in just about any outdoor area, and if you are nuts, in many 
indoor ones. We can be main healers anywhere outside raids. We can deal 
very decent damage if we are allowed to nuke flat-out. And, while not 
quite so good at it, in a pinch we can do crowd control... I don't think 
any other class has quite so many root options as Druids do. Admittedly, 
we can't melee for beans after level 35 or so, and we can't rez.

I'm much more worried about what the new transport options do to the 
game as a whole, than what they may do for Druids. What they did for me 
was to prevent a whole lot of pestering and leave me alone to my xp'ing.

> 2) Many spells indoor only so useles in LDoN

Other than Harmony, not an issue.

> 3) Soloing devalued with the new bonuses for grouping

That's like saying "masturbation devalued as group sex found more fun".

> 4) Not valued as main healers by parties in most cases

Only by parties not worth grouping with, so a blessing. And unlike most 
other classes, we don't *need* a party.

Other than for rezzes, how often do you see that for *any* class?

Bah.
