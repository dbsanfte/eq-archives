I just can't stand the druid/rangers that won't kill amiable critters,
because they are role playing and it would be wrong.  The below statement
was based on what would happen (albeit in RL) if animals were not killed and
had no natural predators.
You won't kill the amiable bears but you have no problem buying the pelts
from others that do kill your bear friends?? Where is the logic there??
Your hands are still dirty from the kill, so your sword didn't bring it down
but you provide the market for someone else to kill them.  What is the harm
in you killing the bears yourself??
