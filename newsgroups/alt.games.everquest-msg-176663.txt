Exactly.  However, that's not the same as saying never Taunt when you
have agro.  An obvious case where you would want to Taunt would be if
a mob had gone after a caster and been rooted to allow the caster to
step clear.  A rooted mob uses strict proximity agro for melee so you
draw agro as long as you are standing closest in, but once root breaks
it may well peel off again so you Taunt to try to get to the top of
the hate list before root breaks.  Another case would be if you have
good reason to suspect that a caster may have surpassed you on the
list, but not by enough to overcome the proximity modifier, and you
expect the caster to keep casting (as when Slow has been resisted 3
times and you expect the Shaman to keep trying until it sticks).  At
least that has worked well for me in non-PoP xp groups, I'd defer to
somebody with real experience in PoP and on raids as to whether that's
good practice there (could well be situational, depending on the mob
and etc., in which case you just need to build up experience in the
zones in question and use your best judgement in the meanwhile).
