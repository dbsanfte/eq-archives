Roleplay however you feel your character
> should, just don't call him Humpurazz.

These names would still be against the naming policy...I am not trying to
get rid of it, just change some of it. Jonny Lazergun is against naming
policy because there is no such thing as a lazergun in eq, so? What if ole
Jonny was your favorite dnd character? but now its nor RP enough? There is a
difference between silly names and names with profanity in them.
