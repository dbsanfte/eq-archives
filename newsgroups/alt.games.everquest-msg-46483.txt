Yes, you can use IRQ steering in BIOS to reconfigure all of the IRQ settings
at boot time, but Win2k (and Win98 if configured for ACPI) will reassign all
of the PnP IRQ's to one that is shared. This is the normal function for
ACPI. ACPI can be disabled in Win2k by changing the system driver through
device manager, but I have never heard of an instance where this helped.

I would try the latest Nvidia reference drivers. Also, check for updated VIA
4-in-one drivers for your MoBo. If you are using a 3com NIC, I've read about
some problems with this. You may check their web site for patches.
