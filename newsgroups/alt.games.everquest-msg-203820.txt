Biz has never snivled (is that a word?) that I can remember.  Lash out with
a vicious attack? Sometimes.  Vocally express his (rather diminished)
opinion of some? Sure.  Complain about the complainers?  Haven't we all?
But never snivle (of even sniffle that I know of, he may be a hanky user).
More often, though, he is in there with experience and advice.  Not that Biz
ever needs a defender.
