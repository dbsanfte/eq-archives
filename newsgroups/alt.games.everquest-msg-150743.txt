Raster is a nightmare....32 hours...96 placeholders...shudder....

The spawn point has a cycle. (I might not remember it exactly)

Game times:
5am (Spawn let PH live)
8am (Despawn)
10am (Spawns and you must kill PH)
10pm  (Spawns and you must kill PH)

If you know the cycle you get 3 chances at Raster per game day (per
@hour+20 real time).

Not the rearest mob in Norrath, but one of the most dreaded camps :)
