Thread Hijack!

I beg to differ - I'd rather spend 400 plat buying a stack of leather
padding then spend the three or four hours needed to farm the components.

There are things I'm willing to spend time on - I became a GM smith, after
all - and there are things I'd rather not spend time on.  Farming pelts and
stuff for leather padding is one of those things I'm happy to have someone
else spend time on, then compensate them for it.

I think it's *great* that the Bazaar has these kind of things for sale - it
allows those who spent the time a way to earn an income off of it, and it
allows those with plat to avoid a few minor timesinks.  This is the Bazaar
economy at its best, imo.

I won't necessarily disagree with you that it means that many people on my
server have "too much plat".  I guess I disagree, though, that "too much
plat" is a bad thing.  I know it's gonna help me twink the heck out of my
froggie alt in a couple of weeks.  =)
