 That and the fact that they have about 11,500 HPs and hit sorta hard.
The HT isn't bad since I can just take it (about 800 I think) and feign.
I'll regen that up fast and his HT wont have enough time to recycle.
Another good trick is to kill his pet first then feign. As a pet caster
he will start casting another one and you can use that time to get in a
few free whacks. This works for Shaman mobs too. Which reminds me, why
don't Seb froggies have pets...

 I regularly clear Verix's room. I actually haven't tried him yet but
I'm guessing it would be tough since he runs, gates and summons. Would
be a fairly tough fight unless I had a snaring weapon (not yet!) and
Instill Doubt landed a lot (kill the wandering Curates first!)

>practice weapon for 1HB. Are you able to solo Disco in Seb yet?

 I haven't actually tried. I'd probably say no since Ilis frogs hit like
a truck and have 12000+ HP. It's faster xp to just kill dars and boks.
Shamans are super easy as long as their slow doesn't land since they
spend most of their time casting. I can usually cut through three of
those before having to heal up.

 If you can get a regular group going they are fast xp. The ones I've
been involved with didn't last long since people had to log and it took
awhile to find replacements for them. Mob-at-a-time camps are less a
pain in the ass for me. I wouldnt turn down an invite but I don't go out
of my way looking for them.

 I guess the xp per kill isn't that bad. But the kill rate can start
crawling if you don't have the right group makeup. Killing a shroom 4
times because it got off three complete heals isn't that fun.

 Juggs/Reets are pretty good xp. If I did a lower Seb camp it would be
this one. It's fun pulling Trakanon to the Reet room just for something
different.
