Or bring along your friendly neighborhood cleric to Mark of Karn that DS
like a silver bullet...of course that doesn't strip the mob of his SLD, SOW,
Feet like Cat, so on and so forth.  Many challenging mobs that seemed
underconned have fallen to a puller using annul to pull with... turns out they
aren't underconned, just hardly anyone ever dispells their buffs.

Consider what a wimp the average tank can be, unbuffed, and how much
more of a powerhouse he can be with an extra Khp, higher AC, dex, str,
DS... especially hybrid mobs are vulnerable to stripping, the famous
Snow Griffin of EW being a classic example
