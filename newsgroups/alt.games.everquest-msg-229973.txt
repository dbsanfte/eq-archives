There may be something in that.  People aren't doing "long term" starting
stats, they're going for hp, hp, hp and hp.  So every ranger is at max
stamina and base wisdom.  Even with that, the advantage still falls to the
warrior before level 9, and grows with every level.

Any advantage toward the warrior is an un-answered advantage (except
infrequently for SKs and paladins).

I didn't actually.  I brought up "pre-Kunark" (i.e., what Discord *is*) and
you misunderstood.  :P
