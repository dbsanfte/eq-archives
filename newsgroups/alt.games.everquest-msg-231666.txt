But if, say, Best Buy decided to ramp up the price of a piece of
software to 3x its normal rate every time their stock ran low, they'd
lose customers pretty damn quick. Its business ethics...

I hardly think going 3 days without milk or a carton of eggs can be
considered a hardship... I'm not talking long-term situations, I'm
talking about a rush to the store to stock up for a snow storm that
will be cleared up within a few days. Yes, it's still illegal to gouge
for milk and such leading up to that storm.

It is most certainly bad business ethics to charge above what the
market value is (NO, "market value" isn't what you decide to charge
when no others are available, it's what the normal price they are sold
for when there ARE others on the market). Yes, there are those who
will pay the higher rate. However, after seeing items at jacked up
prices in your trader too often, they'll likely remember you, and many
will eventually opt to go without the item until it shows up at a
lower price.

Besides, I'd rather sell 10 HQ pelts in a month than take the same
amount of time to sell 1 at 10x the price...
