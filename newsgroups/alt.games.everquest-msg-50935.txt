Are you talking about me?  I was only asking for suggestions on ways to fix
this.  I recently opened up my econ book regarding recession and deflation.
One of the economic goals it states in chapter one is price stability.

Inflation causes recession.  deflation, on the other hand my dad was arguing
causes a stronger economy.  the definition of deflation according to my econ
book is "a fall in the general (average) level of prices in the economy."
the econ book is campbell R. McConnell  10th edition titled Economics.  This
one book covered both Econ 1 and 2, and like several college books I found
interesting 9 years ago, i kept this one.

you also have the lower demand for supplementary goods, that is if FBSS
competes with other haste items for the same demand, thus lower the over
demand for haste items in the broad market.  This is probably another
driving factor in the already oversupplied market.

I think deflation is probably a more accurate term instead of recession,
although I used the term loosely ( at least at first), it is questionable in
if that is actually the case, and thus far I havn't been able to absolutely
verify it.  I need to figure out if in fact deflation also leads to
recession as high inflation does.
