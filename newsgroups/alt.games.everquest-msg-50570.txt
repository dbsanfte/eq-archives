I think eq.castersrealm.com is a great place for Caster info..

You will bind strategies, tricks, and general info there, as well as tons of
info on research and spells..

Learning to control that pet is about 90% of the trick to playing a mage..

A couple of quick hints:

1. When in dungeons, always use /pet guard here  do not use /pet guard
e  -- This will keep your pet in one spot when not attacking, very much less
of a chance of causing a train.

2. If you are in a group be sure to use /pet back off  -- when the mob
begins to run. Let the tanks finish it, or nuke the mob. Don't let your pet
get out of your sight.

3. If you do lose control of your pet, sometimes it's best to invis to get
rid of it. Invis will get rid of it, regardless of where it's at. It's
preferable (IMO) to have to use another component, rather than a
train/corpse run/xp loss..

You will find a wealth of info at castersrealm.. Check out the forums there
too.
