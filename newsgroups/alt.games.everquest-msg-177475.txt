Level 20ish?  Stonebrunt Mountains.  Once you get to 25, go to Marus
Seru in Luclin and mess up rockhoppers to 30ish.  Once you get 30, go
to Iceclad and kill cougars.  At 35ish, head to Dawnshroud Peaks and
mess up Zelniaks all to way into your 40's.  Mid 40's, head back to
Velious and kill Mammoths and Rhinos in Easter Wastes.
