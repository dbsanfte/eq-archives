    Replace your spell button with the following macro:

/doability <forage>
/book
/doability <direction sense>
/loc
/book

You'll forage & direction sense every time you change spells.  I
repeated the book command because sometimes the single command didn't
work.  At low levels you don't change spells often because you don't
have many.  My druid is 46 and swaps spells constantly as it is
needed.
