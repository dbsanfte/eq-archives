Doing the /report is always a good idea, but from personal experience, I can
tell you that having your corpse buried somewhere under the world is
sufficient for a guide to do the CS Rez on you.  My response time was much
worse however, as I died at 1AM PST, didn't get any help in the hour or so I
remained online afterwards, did get help within 30 minutes when I got back
on much later that morning.
