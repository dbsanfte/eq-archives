Pretty sure I know what method one from the first link is .. I was
reading up on monk stuff and stumbled across something that sounds
similar

first what he said

METHOD ONE: A cycle that produces drops worth up to 15K platinum.
This same 15K item is often sold for $250 in real cash.  Plenty of
other drops in this cycle are worth between a few hundred platinum to
close to 10K.  Values in real dollars for these drops range from
$5-100 each.  You'll need to be at least level 45 to do this one. 

now a link to what I believe it to be 

http://www.monkly-business.com/zones/sola.php

it more or less involves farming the hell out of Sol A, I may very
well be wrong in my assumption as i won't pay real money to learn how
to make plat in a game. However if you want to buy them and post a
link not only would it make many happy to see that done to these
people but we could all point out the flaws as well... the flaw in the
one from my link is I don't think it has stayed accurate as prices for
those drops have fallen. I still hang in sol A when I can't get a
group in sol B and am bored. I can pull in about a hundred plat an
hour I through the fine steel in my tinks bag that I inherited from a
nec I no longer enjoy and go sell it to the goblin merchant. of course
as a monk i can sneak and fd so he'll trade with me ... then again
other characters won't have the wt issue I have so it all works out.
