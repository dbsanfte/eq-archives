Living shield has a very short timer.    It is only active for someting like
12 seconds, unless extended by AA.  When shielding someone, the person
shielded will take 50% damage from all melee attacks.   The person doing the
shielding will take 75% of the total damage the target would have taken.
Spell attacks are not effected.

Example, warrior shields an enchanter who is being beat on.  Enchanter would
have taken 1000 damage from the hits.   End result, enchanter takes 500
damage and the warrior takes 750 damage.

I don't find it all that useful myself.

(Mobs get an extra advantage, in that when they shield each other, each one
will take 50% of the total melee damage. )
