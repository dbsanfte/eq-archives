I have a smattering of French, mostly gone now, and found that to be a 
much easier language than English.  I used to speak fluent Hebrew, and 
that is most definitely an easier language than English.  English just 
has way too much inconsitancy to be easy to really learn.  You can learn 
enough to get by without too much trouble, but you will be constantly 
stumbling into the inconsistancies of the language.
