Bweekle the Gnome is incapable of "clicking on" X`Aridot the Dark Elf. 
"Clicking on" someone is not a roleplay action.

So now you want to argue a specific number of things that would look
like other things at a casual glace?  Season your adventurer to taste,
it makes no matter if the items look the same.  Not similar, the same. 
Yet somehow clicking on someone gives you the ability to know exactly
what it is?  Arguing  about how many items could look the same seems
pretty silly after that leap of logic.

Exactly!  Take a quick glance at someone from behind a tree and you get
an idea of what they appear to be wearing.  Ask them and you either get
an exact answer or told to go fly a kite or something inbetween.  Do you
really think you could stealthily creep up on me and ascertain the brand
of underwear I have on?  Even well seasoned adventurers are gonna have a
tough time with that one, but not a click inspection, it tells all.  The
more you try to explain the less logical your argument seems.  At least
Biz admitted that he wanted to know and fuck all if he cared what
someone said about it, you seem to be trying to hide that same belief
behind crumbling walls of illogic.

No its not. (See, I can refute simple bs responses as easily as your
attempts at logic.  Either tack is fine, but I'd prefer to stick to
actual logical debate, so try to support your contentions with something
more than this please.)

Tell the difference between a pair of Acme white tube socks and a pair
of Zedme white tube socks without checking the lable.  Even in the real 
world with graphics limited only by your own eyesight this would be dang
near impossible.  Some things look exactly like other things, even in
the real world.  To be able to tell at a glance the difference between a
magic foo and a standard foo despite the fact that both foos look 
exactly the same because they do, not because of an engine limit, is
ludicrous, I don't care how you season your adventurers.  Stop relying
on the concept that its an engine limitation and accept that you can't
always tell what something is at a glance, whereas an EQ inspection
never fails.

Guess you weren't.
