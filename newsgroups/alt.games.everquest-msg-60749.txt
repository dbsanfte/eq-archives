You can't put a Chevy engine in a Ford?  Guess all those hot-rods are
just going to *poof* out of existance now.  Dammit, and I really
wanted a duece coupe.  (The small-block chevy V8 has been pretty much
the standard for making frankenstein cars for several decades, I've
seen 'em in Porsche 914s, in Audi 5000s, in VW bugs, and in lots of
Fords.  They are cheap, dependable, and ubiquitous.)
