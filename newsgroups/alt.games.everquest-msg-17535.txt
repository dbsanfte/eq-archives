You missed part of this. I am the cleric in question. I'm only level 32.
I can only revive. They want me to revive them to their corpse to save
themselves a walk. For instance, I rev'ed a mage in North Ro who was
bound in Cazic-Thule yesterday. There's no way he can pay me up front
for his service, because if he could loot his corpse, he wouldn't need
me. Since I wasn't doing anything anyway, I searched for his corpse, and
didn't negotiate a price or expect payment. He gave me 105gp, which I
thought generous of him.

The jerk of a couple nights ago simply pestered me for a revive and
offered me lots of plat. I sent him a tell after I cast it, asking him
to pay a much reduced but still large enough to cover my aggrivation
with him amount, and all I received from him was silence. He looted his
corpse, ignored me completely, and left. I've put his name down as
someone I'm never helping again.

For a rezz when they are bringing the corpse, sure, they can pay up
front. But not for a revive. While most of the revives I have done for
free, if I am grouped with others and busy keeping them alive, I'm going
to charge for the annoyance to my group and me- and if we're rocking,
the price goes up. I've charged from 5pp to 20pp, simply because I know
I'm not saving you XP- just the walk- and that's how much money I'd be
making spending the same amount of mana on my group.
