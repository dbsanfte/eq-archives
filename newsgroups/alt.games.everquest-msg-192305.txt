Same thing happened to me on my Win 98 system. Here's what fixed it for me.
Start EQ as normal. When it gets to the EULA screen do a Atl + Enter to go
to windowed mode. Stay in windowed mode until you log in. Then hit Alt +
Enter to go full screen again. I only had to do this once, the next time I
logged in it was fine.

Good Luck,
Naphtoe
