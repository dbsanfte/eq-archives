Question please ---

What are Gynok's placeholds and where do they spawn? Do do they spawn in a
particular sequence? I have been working on the assumption taht they spawn at
Gynok's spawn point -- the first single bone as you zone in to Befallen. Is
this correct? Also I have been led to understand that he spawns once every
eight hours and in addition to dropping the copper and plat -CHA ring, he also
drops the gold ring, although this drop is significantly  more rare than the
plat drop?
