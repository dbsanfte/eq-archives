Finally got my 40th Ranger there last night (total of six hours of different
patches, three EQ crashes when entering Jaggedpine, etc.) :(

From near the zone-in point, on track, most of the MOBs were dark blue to me,
cave basilisks mainly, and some others. There is a banker now, about two
buildings away from the zone in point! No more three zones away banking in
South Qeynos.

Also want to check this, but I hope the small city at the zone in point is
"melee bindable"..... didn't have time to check that, had only about five
minutes in the zone before I had to log.

Can't wait to go exploring.
