I cant remember if it was a druid or wizard...

But they wanted about 75plat to teleport me someplace (it was Gfay/BBM or
something not any special zone)

I thought it was insane, and the person was 40+

I normally travel everyplace on foot without sow, or any buff. I am a
warrior so I am slow...I dont mind though. The only time I need a port is to
BBM/WC (I became KOS in FreePort its a real pain)
