"Uncounted" is an interesting term.  It suggests sheer conjecture, as
opposed to true understanding.  Uncounted, meaning less than 1:1, more than
1:1?  We don't know.  Are these racists acts always committed with the white
as an aggressor, and minorities as the victims?  Are there no asian-run
stores ransacked in the ghetto for racist reasons?  Are white people never
singled out as targets of crime?  We know that these happen, yet people
assume that all racism is white-on-minority.  In that case, where is the
protection for whites?

Such partisan statements...  I tend to dismiss anyone who takes such a
stance, since they tend only to believe what they want to believe (after
all, I am selfish and willfully blind by your definition), but you've proven
to be more open in the past.  I'll assume that your words came out harsher
than you inteneded for them to.

How can the desire of whites not to be discriminated against be considered
selfish?  We consider it a God-given right for everyone but whites, why is
that?  I've been on the wrong side of the affirmative-action law, I've seen
how it works.  How is it equal protection under law, if I'm discriminated
against because my parents were of european descent?  You're accusation of
selfishness for a group of people who don't want to be subjected to what
nobody else whats to be subjected to is insensitive, and very hypocritical.
If it's not good to discriminate against blacks, then it's not good to
discriminate against whites.  Racism is racism, no matter how you look at
it, and "shut up, whitey" won't make it any less so.

Times have changed, the world is open to blacks who don't believe it when
they're told they can't do something because of their skin color.  There are
many blacks who do not need affirmative action, because they're too busy
getting ahead to have time to be a vicitm.

It's like a friend of mine from high school.  He didn't want to mark "asian"
on his application to the Air Force Academy, because he didn't want to be
accepted for his race.  Instead, he was accepted for his achievements.
Quite simply, if you aren't qualified on your own merits, you shouldn't get
the job, regardless of race.
