Of course I'm not *sure* it isn't the ISP. I don't work for Verizon nor do
I know what their maintenance schedules are. I do know that I don't get
kicked from several P2P apps and other associated online apps. I know it
may not even be Verizon's fault but some intermediary. It could be that
since the server is full some Europeans or Asians are hitting the server
while I'm asleep (nor do I blame them). I take into account for all that
and frankly this peevage is a minor one. However, added up with the other
little peevages, I'm seriously beginning to wonder how long this one will
hold my attention.
