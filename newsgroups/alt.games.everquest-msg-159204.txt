Been playing around with rez to see what else it might be useful
for in the past couple days, and I found one thing NOT to do.  In
110 levels as a cleric, plus numerous more as a variety of other
classes, for some reason I never tried this.

Rez the body but leave the box up, rather than clicking yes or
no.

Loot the body.

Click yes.

Guess what.. you get a message that says "we can't find the body,
no rez for jooo" or words to that effect.

Now the funny thing is, if you rez a body, then move the body,
then click yes, you rez to the spot where the body was when the
rez was started.  So what "finding the body" has to do with
anything is anybody's guess.  But don't do this.
