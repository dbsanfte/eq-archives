  Use /report next time if the offender says anything incriminating.  A
/report takes a snapshot of the last 10 lines of text in your chat window
and validates it with the server (thus it can't be faked).  If you /tell a
person "PLEASE stop killstealing me." and they reply with something like "no
that's what u get", type /report and their name with that text visible 10
lines up from the bottom of your chat screen.  Scroll up and do multiple
/reports if necessary.

  But yes, never tell them you are going to /petition or that you have
/petitioned.  First try to get them to admit their wrongdoing by saying "Why
did you just KS me?" or "Why are you harassing me?" ect.  If they have a
reasonable explanation or apologize and quit, you can let it rest right
there.  If they taunt you or say anything that confirms your "accusation",
/report it, and follow up with a /petition describing your problem, and
don't tell them you've done so.  If they aren't stupid enough to taunt or
admit what they've done, you should still /petition immediately describing
the event to the best of your abilities, but the GM will have to witness the
character in the act of some sort of wrongdoing, so you may be out of luck.
However, if enough /petitions stack up from enough different people about a
character, you can be sure that person is going to have a relatively close
eye kept on them.
