Looks like Winter's Roar, the free EQ server with expansions only through 
Velious, was the subject of a Cease-and-Desist order from SOE.  It's down 
and may never come back up.

I kinda have mixed feelings about that.  I mean, yeah, SOE has to vigorously 
defend its rights.  It seemed, though, that allowing a free server would 
only arouse interest in the for-pay version of the game.

Myself, I can't imagine being stuck in the Velious expansion.  No Nexus?  No 
PoK?  No Bazaar?  Having to take boats everywhere?  I remember those things 
with fondness only because they were unpleasant experiences I overcame, not 
because they are things I care to go through again.  =)

Still, I know quite a few people thought EQ was at its height during the 
Velious years, and longed to recapture that spirit, thus they enjoyed 
Winter's Roar immensely.  Too bad it got taken down.
