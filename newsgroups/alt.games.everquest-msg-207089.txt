Happens in lowbie zones too.  I've had my Druid singled out by the
DEs in MM, had them running past 3 or 4 other sitting characters to
get a whack in on me before a tank jumped on 'em.  I wonder if there
isn't some sort of weird faction issue involved.  DEs in general
seem to have extra hate for my human Druid, in Dulak I have to be
much more careful of sit agro from DE mobs than other races (even
when mob "type" is same, i.e. "shady treasure sorter" which come in
several different race models).
