Incidentally, DT, I think that you're tilting at windmills on this
one. It is, of course, still possible to raid in non-PoP zones without
PoP and its raid features, but I know of no raiding guild that does
so. Nor is it reasonable to expect a guild that you are a new member
of to change the way it does business for your sake. And the post-50
players without PoP are simply too small of a minority to cater to.

At their best, guilds are voluntary associations of like-minded
players who want to play together in the manner they have chosen. If
you don't want to play the way they do, don't get involved in the
association.

I can't tell you how much intraguild strife I've seen from people who
picked a guild based on limited information, then banged their heads
against everyone trying to turn the guild into what they wanted it to
be in the first place. It's just not worth it.

If a guild decides that they want to play in a way that they feel
requires PoP, they're probably not the guild for you.
