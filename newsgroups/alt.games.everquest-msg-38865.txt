bind yourself, (no bind= need cleric for revive) duel someone and loose.
Now you just have to drag your corpse with weight penality.

Loot you corpse when you need items and money.

Second thing cool NO RENT items wont poof in your corpse so you can log and
come back later, the shadow rapiere will still be into your corpse.
