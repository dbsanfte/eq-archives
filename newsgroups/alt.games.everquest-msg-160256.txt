Ah, if Skin Like Wood doesn't do this, then its responsible for my misunderstanding
about the entire line.  As with so many other things, my old motto "Verant Teaches Us
Wrong" continues to apply!  I have played most classes thru their earliest levels at
least in order to learn a little about them, but quite often I stumble accross a place
where basic truths about the class change as you level up, and I'm worng in general
where I'm right about the lower levels.

Bard charm, for example, changes radically somewhere in the upper 30s.  Ick.

The delay is not responsible for my misunderstanding about this, on the other hand,
I'm sure you'll grant that I'm intimately familiar with this quirk of the game.  I
meant that when your HP max jumped from 100 to 110, your HP dropped to what, 91% and
gradually climbed up at your normal heal rate to 110, not that it lagged a bit before
jumping up to full bar.

As an aside, as laggy as other HP totals are, try the Donal's BP effect on for size.
This one takes easily twice as long to take effect for some reason.  And after a 30
second casting delay, that extended visible effect delay can be really nerve wracking.

Now I'll have to.  Bah.  He swore never to cast a spell in anger again, too!
