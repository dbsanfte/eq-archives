I agree with the last post, but not because I feel that EQ should be a profit
making operation.  There are only 2 reasons people would sell high level
accounts for $1000 +.  First, as the previous post says, they have become bored
with the game.  Verant should expand and create levels where a person can
ascend to Level 100 or even more.  The second reason is because  other players
see this as an easy way to farm items for resale.  Verant could do away with
this, at least partially, by making any quest reward a NO DROP, NO TRADE item. 
Unfortunately, Verant and Sony have decided to get into legal warfare instead
of working on gameplay to solve the sales problem.
