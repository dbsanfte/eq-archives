ROFL.  I don't know how you're getting that out of what I posted, even
after you oh so carefully mangled my post.

Here, as an exercise in not particularly scholarly analysis let's
restore a key portion of what you snipped above:
/quote kaev
of leisure reading here.  EQ is a real-time interactive environment in
which we talk to one another in order to coordinate our actions.  If
you deliberately make yourself hard for your groupmates to understand
you do them a tremendous discourtesy and ought to be booted from the
group as a clear "message" in reply.  Non-group social interactions
in-game are a different matter, of course.
/quote

Changes things just a bit, don't you think?
Now, try responding to what I wrote instead of gutting my text to
create a strawman.
