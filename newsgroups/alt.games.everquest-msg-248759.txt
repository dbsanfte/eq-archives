Foxeye, as you all know, was a ranger in EQ.  Hated the bow.  Loved the
staff.  Tried to tank.  Did I mention I hated the bow?

For EQ2 I've been planning on shifting my focus to a new character, an
Iksar Priestess who turns to the Good Guys (I model her after Zhaan, the
blue chick from Farscape).  However, I do intend to create Foxeye as my
artisan alt.  And since artisans are no longer a pure class, she'll have
to choose some sort of adventurers role.

So, well, I was *assuming* Ranger.  Logical, neh?  But, um, I think they
really are pidgeonholing rangers as archers.  No more magic, which is
cool, but the archery thing is very front and center. Due to them
retaining the restrictions on priestclass weapons (druids = scimitar,
shaman = spear, cleric = anything blunt), I have to assume that they'll
emphasize bow and blades for the rangers, whilst only giving the really
nice quarterstaves to monks.

/em Foxeye looks around to make sure no one is watching and quietly slips
out of the ranger tent and sneaks into the monk tent

I always *did* say she was more of a monk/druid hybrid than a
fighter/druid hybrid, but...bleh, I feel like a traitor. O_O  

.

Or who knows, maybe I'll go really strange and make her a Troubador...say
that she now tells stories to the kiddies by the fire about the "olden
days".  But for sure, no more archery...had 'nuff of that.
