Nameds drop Glyph Runed words too, and have a more frequent drop
rate than anything else in the zone area 'wings', but will regularly
drop nothing but the ring of torden. They also have rare drop loot.
Very rare drop. But its really rather nice too, considering the
ease of the mobs.

An enchanter, at 65, can solo those nameds using the neighbouring
giants as pets, by the way, and I havent heard of my guilds xp
groups having the troubles you did, but it may simply be that they
had the healing tactic 'pre-refined'.

Once you have getting the nameds killed down they take very little
extra time, and the XP and loot drops make it worth it. The wings
also have level 64 minibosses in some of them who are significantly
easier and a set of named 'creatures' that, so far, have dropped
nothing for me, but I suspect just have a 'rarer than hell' table.

I've had very good XP groups there compared to POV, by the way; the
mobs hit hard, but are relatively poorly armoured, so a group of
serious DPS can drop them very fast indeed. Typically, cleric,
enchanter, ranger, ranger, rogue, rogue has worked very well without
requiring 'med breaks'.
