Supposedly.  I'll take everyone's word on that...all I know is with 210 INT
I haven't had a skill increase in jewelcraft for about 20 tries now (skill
194). BUT ANYWAY....

If you're concerned about resists you're probably 46+.  It's time to start
creating different kits.  I mean, what do you care about skill increases if
you're fighting Naggy that night?  So remove some of your INT and other
stuff and put on your Fire gear.  That's why I mentioned 190 INT being
fine...it's fine for 90% of whatever it is you're doing...when you do
trades, sure, get that sucker up as high as you can...the rest of the time
go with other gear.
