Please keep in mind as you read this, I stopped playing my enchanter 18
months ago, but this is how I did some things or would use some of the new
game mechanics.

First, as I understand it, a creature that is already Mezed will have a
higher chance of being re-mezed.  Atleast I found that to be the case.
Hence, after you tashan the mobs, recast your AE Mez.  Don't know it this
changed but the AE will not overwrite/reset the individual one.

10 hotkeys.  This has to be one of the best additions for enchanters.  Get
used to casting spells using the keyboard, yoru mouse is needed for
targeting.  Also, I would suggest having a special set of spells and
socials set up on one of the hotkey pages, just for dungeons.  Here are
the 10 I would keep on there.

Spell Book
AE Mez
Tashan
Mez
Laguid
Root
AE Stun
/groupsay One on me, %t
/groupsay Many on me
/groupsay Run /shout Train to zone

The groupsay one on me, %t - I like the %t to tell the taunter who to
taunt, but some people think the extra targeting step is too much.  Also
you can replace the AE Stun with /groupsay Need heal, please

In zones with lag that one is very important, as your hps drop FAST and
the cleric might not notice in time, and a shaman or druid will have
trouble out healing 3 or 4 mobs hitting you.

Hope this helps.

I'm thinking of starting an ENC on my current server, so please let me
know if this idea appeals to you.
