No, it won't cut it if you want to continue with "runs very nicely."  You
need 512MB RAM (about $50) and a video card that supports T&L.  Since I can
never remember which ATI cards that covers I'd recommend AT THE VERY LEAST a
Geforce2MX400 - 64MB (about $60) but preferably a GeForce3ti200 (about $140)
or better.

Your CPU is fast enough...Video card does most of the work in EQ.

And Luclin isn't THAT great anyway...there's still a hell of a lot you
haven't seen yet on the three original continents or the 2 expansions.
