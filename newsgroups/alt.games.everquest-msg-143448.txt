Seriously, what bad things would happen if RF could be triggered at will
(i.e. any cleric with the right support could get their epic now) ?

Considering that all top level guilds will have epic clerics, and I
would guess that most of the next level too. What "damage" to the game
dynamics would this cause ?

I can see that this could mean that smaller guilds would then be able to
attempt higher risk tactics / raids, but would this be a bad thing ?

The only explanations I have heard for keeping RF as is are :

It's an epic it should be hard !
Note that hard != long / dull / tedious

It will unbalance the game 
So I ask how ?

Cheers,

Jim
