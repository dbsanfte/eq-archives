well no one is answering my questions anymore, so i guess i'll post here.  i
have 2 more questions, then i think i'm done for awhile (no promises):

is jewelry making really worth anything or am i wasting my time with it?

i have started baking (lvl 4) and am already making small profits from it,
whereas i am losing money with the jewelry making.  i assume this means
baking is a good skill to know and one that will make me good money in the
future.  Is that true?
