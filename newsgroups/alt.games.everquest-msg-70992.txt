I started about May of 99'

Looking back I think this game has given me the best entertainment
per dollar of any other computer game I have ever played. Actually
it has saved me money since I dumped my cable/satellite subscription
services which amounted to $130 a month. I had 237 channels and
most of the time there was nothing on any of the channels, LOL!
I am still staring at a CRT but at least its a wee bit more interactive than
a TV. =)
