Rashere Clarifies Progression Server Plans  
Rashere posted on April 12 on the EQPlayers forums: 

"...I want to clarify a few things about this progression server. 

First, this is specifically not a classic server. We are not
attempting to revert EQ back to its original state. Not only is that a
technical impossibility, but the nostalgia people have is due more to
it being the first large persistent world that people encountered than
any specific gameplay mechanic that has since been changed. That
feeling is no more able to be recaptured than the feeling of a first
kiss. 

This server is primarily a new-player server, it just has a twist in
how the content is unlocked to allow players to play through the
progression of content as it was released to the game. At its core,
what we're doing is simply locking out expansions, similar to what
would happen if you didn't own them at all, until some in-game
criteria has been met. Generally, this will be defeating the end game
content for the expansion. Defeating Vox and Nagafen, for instance,
will likely open up Kunark for the server. 

That does mean that anything that is tied to an expansion will not be
available until that expansion has been opened up. So, when the server
first launched, you won't have Iksar, Vah Shir, Frogloks, Beastlords,
or Berserkers. It also means that anything that has been opened up to
all players over the years will be available from the start. In-game
maps is a good example. Also, anything that has been added since
release or changed since release will still be there on the server.
Freeport and Ro will be using their revamped graphics, for instance,
and boats won't work on the new server any better than they do on
other servers. 

There are a few exceptions to those rules that we will be making and a
few more we are still discussing. 

While Plane of Knowledge and the Bazaar are no longer expansion
locked, we will likely keep those turned off until Planes of Power is
opened up. [He later corrected that the Bazaar was released with
Luclin.] 

Veeshan's Peak will likely be reverted to a previous state since
that's the end game content of Kunark. 

The tutorial will be available. This is first and foremost a newbie
server and its important that new players get some lessons on how to
play the game. You will likely go to your home city after finishing
the tutorial, though, instead of PoK since that's not likely to exist
at first. We are looking into the impact that the tutorial gear will
have on the server and may make some changes to mitigate it if we feel
its going to be a balance problem. 

Rashere"
