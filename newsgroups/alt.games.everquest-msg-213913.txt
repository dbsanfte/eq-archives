Necromancers have a mez line, so even a soloing necro should be able to
understand why the DOT portion of Darkness is a disadvantage.  Pull a mob
(sensibly doing so with your snare) and start fighting it, get an add that turns
out to be unmezzable, and you can't mez the original mob and turn to fight the
add instead; that dot dot dot will keep waking the mob up.  Of course not having
a DOTless snare the necro makes do with what he does have, but he should be
capable of imagining what it might be like not to have to suffer with the DOT
part.
