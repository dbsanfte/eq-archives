No it didn't. Troll and Iksar already have a racial bonus. Why should Troll and
Iksar get twice the bonus for the same AA cost as other races?

KoS is what Trolls and Iksar paid for the initial racial regen they got at the
start.

Besides, being KoS is only really a problem in the old world. Hardly
a problem at all on Velious or the moon. Faction work to fix most
problems is not that hard.

Why? All the races get the same benefit of all general the AA points.
Should druids get a Run3 that makes their sow faster and deny it
to anyone else?
