Hi,

I play as a dark elf necromancer now at lvl 15, and i'm thinking of
going to najena, how hard is that place? can i solo there, with pet?
i'm interested in trying to get my hands on a enchanted fine steel
great staff, but i can't afford to buy it, price is around 300pp.

/Regards Berth aka Thotamon lvl 15 de necro luclin
