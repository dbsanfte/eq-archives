Well, I can always come up with sarcasm, if you're certain that's
what's required to discuss "the issue at hand like an adult".  A
better question, to my mind, is why in hell should a 52 Cleric be
100% effective grouping way above his level, while a 52 plate tank
would be useless?  Answer that one for me and I'll consider your
demand that game rules be changed for your personal convenience.
