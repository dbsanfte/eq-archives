The key to true torture is to give them a VERY useful item for their
level before porting them. They thank you heartily, trust you and will
autoclick a translocate (so you don't have to gate or port back) and

unattractive. How many times will that newbie warrior try to get back
to his langsaxe holding corpse before it decays?
