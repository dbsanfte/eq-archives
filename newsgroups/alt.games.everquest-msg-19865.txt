I doubt there will be much in the way of server to server transfers.
Most cases of character transfers I've seen so far are folks who have
high enough alternates that they want to be able to seperate out from
their main.

For example, I have a wizard in my guild (level 60), who mistakenly
started a rogue on the same account (who is now also level 60).  A
wizard with dragonbane or rogue with ragebringer?  That's a question
he has to answer everytime we decide to do ToV or Yelinak.

If he can transfer one of the characters to another account, he can
bring both.

Similarly, my warrior twink who I mistakenly created on my main's
account, is now gotten enough no drop items and high enough level that
I don't really feel like starting over again.

For $50, it's worth it for me to be able to transfer him off to a
different account.
