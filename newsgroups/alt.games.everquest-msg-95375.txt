Ahhh, memories.  I started EQ in August, on MT.  I picked it cuz it
was showing the least players on the server, and that was what a book
had reccomended.  Anyway, it was either my first or second day playing
(my memory fails me - age is a terrible thing), and like one of the
posters above mentioned, I was running around, clueless, killing the
odd bat, hanging around the lifts, when a guy hailed me.  He had an
entire set of banded on him, he didn't need it, and he was tired of
carrying it, so he gave me the whole works.  It had never even crossed
my MIND to ask any of the players for anything, and I was floored.
Since then, I've had the same attitude most here seem to.  If I see
someone exhibiting TRUE newbiness, I'm VERY generous.  Beggars do
indeed "hork me off", and I generally tell them that there's plenty of
cash and weapons on the critters in the nearest newbie zone.  BTW, I
wore that banded right up til I started replacing it with ivy etched,
and while I haven't been able to give away the the entire suit, i've
been giving it away piece by piece, as I don't need them anymore.
