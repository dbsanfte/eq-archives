Technically for straight comparison, dmgx2 or dmgx2+1 isn't relevant.

iff
	[WeaponA(dmgx2+1/delay) < WeaponB(dmgx2+1/delay)]
then
	[WeaponA(dmg/delay) < WeaponB(dmg/delay)]

(provided dmg & delay are positive integers)

so the simpler calculation will still determine which weapon is 
relatively better.

Beware parsing...few people seem to be able to do them correctly. If two 
weapons are pretty close, a simple parse of even several hours play may 
be quite unreliable... your group (and group competency) will affect 
your damage output, the exact level makeup of your opponents will affect 
your damage output, etc etc etc... a good controlled parse is a 
nontrivial endeavour.
