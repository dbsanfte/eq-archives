Sorry shitbird, but in the circles I move in everyone knows the quote so it's
not required to annote it when I paraphrase it.

For someone who lies regularly, mis-quotes people with the intent to distort
their words, hides when when his shit is exposed, and is a coward to boot; you
are really obsessing about this quote.

Can you find another instance of my "stealing" a quote?


-Well, God was my co-pilot....but we crashed into a mountain and I had to eat
Him.
