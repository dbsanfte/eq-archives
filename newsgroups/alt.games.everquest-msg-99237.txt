I created a gnome SK, twinked him up pretty well (BS tunic, DWB, MOSS,
AC4/45HP rings, some BA stuff), gave him SLN, SoW, Chloro.  Not my best
twink (my gnome warrior started with complete crafted, for instance), but
he's pretty well off.

But even with just SLN the results would be the same...yellow & red cons up
through level 3 at least (he just dinged 4...I've only been able to spend 30
minutes on him) give 1.5 yellows.  The max pre-patch per kill was .5 yellow,
so they've tripled it.  He killed probably 30 critters to get to level 4,
but mostly 'cause I was farting around...he only NEEDED 12 kills slightly
twinked to reach it.

BTW, I took him to Lavastorm at level 3, had him (try to) beat on a level
10ish goblin (very high red).  Once he did more than 10 damage my druid cast
the 24-point DS on him, then used Grasping Roots (10pts damage...that's why
I had to wait 'til over 10 was done by SK) to root it to let the DS kill the
critter.

He still got 1.5 yellows, so that seems to be the new cap.
