The act of inspecting does not slow me down. Read what I said. It is what
sometimes follows that slows me down and it could be prevented by turning
off other players ability to inspect me.

There are players that feel the same way on both sides and no real reason
not to allow players to choose other than they won't. All players are asking
is the right to choose. Enough players feel uncomfortable about it for what
ever reason they may have. While it in itself is not a reason some will
leave the game for it is one of the many small reason that a player may
leave the game for. In this time that Verant is losing clients to other
games along the same lines I would think they would want to try and keep as
many as happy as possible. Since there is "no reason either way". Why not
let the players choose?
