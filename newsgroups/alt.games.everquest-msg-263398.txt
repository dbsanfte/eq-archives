I think my analysis summed it up fairly, but your disagreement is noted. 
Players like you and those you grouped with didn't seem to mind the loss of 
stats and didn't consider that it affected game play at all. This fits 
perfectly with my analysis that the death penalty is a good system, because 
for those people like you and your friends who don't care, it's not an 
issue. For those people who do care about performance, slowing down leveling 
(not to mention not being able to equip your gear lol), then the penalty is 
an incentive. Seems to work for everyone.

I have a better idea: players can use their own judgment and decide for 
themselves. ;-)
