There's not much point in continuing the discussion if you can't get past 
this one flawed idea, that gameplay is going to be significantly "different" 
after someone waves a magic wand and says "Released". The mechanics will 
still be there, much of the same audience will still be there, and more than 
likely the world will be even more populated than it is now. History tells 
us that little will change.

Of course your theories are just as "valid" as mine. I happen to think 
they're wrong, but feel free to make them anyway. MUDs don't really provide 
a very robust model for comparison in this discussion because they were 
mostly niche products for a very niche crowd whose demographics and 
behaviors probably have very little in common with players of the more 
mainstream MMOGs (UO, EQ, AC, AO, DAoC, SWG, TSO). I've been in the betas 
and then release for UO, EQ, AC, AO, DAoC, and SWG, and in every case I've 
seen the phenomenon described here. It has never failed, and if anything the 
WoW experience looks to be more prototypical than most of those were. Back 
as early as 1997 when UO was in beta, the very same arguments that you are 
making in this thread, were being made by others who at least had no benefit 
of experience to work from. I will admit that I was persuaded entirely by 
the arguments the first time I heard them, and put great faith in the 
anticipated change after UO went to release and credit cards became required 
to continue. Same with Diablo2. But in those cases and in every other one, 
when release hit the only thing that changed was that a hell of a LOT more 
players entered, the vast majority of whom were entirely representative of 
those who'd played in beta. Disappointing, but true. True then, and I 
predict true now. We'll see.

No, only those who failed, or chose not to observe. The data was always 
there.

Did you play in the WoW stress test? You keep describing it as "ridiculously 
crowded", yet I've never seen it that way. All the available spawns were 
camped, but this isn't the same as saying that it's ridiculously crowded. 
The other conclusion being drawn by some in this discussion is simply that 
there aren't that many spawns to camp in the first place, so even a modest 
population will experience the problems described. The history of Blizzard 
stress tests vs. release tells us that the populations on game day will 
indeed be crowded, probably far more than they are today. Witness Diablo2's 
100,000 player stress test vs 2 million players on game day. Same company, 
same marketing staff, same tremendous pre-game hype. I think I'm safe in 
predicting that it will be even more crowded on game day than it is today, 
and will remain so for some significant time.
