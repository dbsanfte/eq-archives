This is generally not true.  Once the person has dragged the corpse to you,
they can loot it and get the cash off of it.  As long as they don't loot the
final item, it can still be resurrected.

The only situation where they couldn't, would be if they offered more than was
on thier corpse at the time.   Which doesn't happen all that often at the
experience levels where rezzes are requirements.   You could still get
whatever they have.  Or send them off to the bank, or ask for collateral. ;)
