    We see "Hail, The Great Saphrophyte" in guild chat every so often. Our
rogues can solo it, but given the way it fights with the summoning they
might be better equipped to fight it than the average caster. Right now
we're getting all our clerics Wands of Casual Blessings (14/25 1HB 25 STA
100 HP/MANA 20 all saves right click Remove Greater Curse), so soon we won't
bother killing it.
