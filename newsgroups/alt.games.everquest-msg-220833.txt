I just edited a window to have "XP:xx% AA:yy%" in it.

If you can do even basic XML editing it's very easy to add
this to a window.

EQType26 is XP percentage, EQType27 is AA percentage (I have
a site bookmarked on my home comp. with all of them listed, but
don't have it here)

The default Player Window is 78 pixels high.  an extra 14 will
give you more than enough room to put in the percentages -
modify the 


	<Screen item = "PlayerWindow">
		<!--<ScreenID/>-->
		<RelativePosition>false</RelativePosition>
		<Location>
			<X>516</X>
			<Y>0</Y>
		</Location>
		<Size>
			<CX>124</CX>
			<CY>78</CY>
		</Size>

section near the bottom of the file so that you have
    	    	    	<CY>92</CY>

Now, you want to put the percentages at Y = 78 (they
are 12 pixels high, so you will have a bit of a spacer at
the bottom) and X = 11, the reason for this is that the
other text in there is offset by 11 on the x axis.  3 for the
gauge, 8 on the textoffset.

First you want a static label - (the SDK is to prevent collisions
in the namespace)

	<Label item ="SDK_XPPercLabel">
		<!--<Font>3</Font>-->
		<RelativePosition>true</RelativePosition>
		<Location>
			<X>11</X>
			<Y>78</Y>
		</Location>
		<Size>
			<CX>20</CX>
			<CY>12</CY>
		</Size>
		<Text>XP:</Text>
		<TextColor>
				<R>200</R>
				<G>200</G>
				<B>200</B>
		</TextColor>
		<NoWrap>true</NoWrap>
		<AlignCenter>false</AlignCenter>
		<AlignRight>false</AlignRight>
		<AlignLeft>true</AlignLeft>
	</Label>

Then you want the actual percentage

	<Label item ="SDK_XPPerc">
		<ScreenID>XPPerc</ScreenID>
		<EQType>26</EQType>
		<RelativePosition>true</RelativePosition>
		<Location>
			<X>31</X>
			<Y>78</Y>
		</Location>
		<Size>
			<CX>14</CX>
			<CY>12</CY>
		</Size>
		<Text>xx</Text>
		<TextColor>
				<R>255</R>
				<G>255</G>
				<B>255</B>
		</TextColor>
		<NoWrap>true</NoWrap>
		<AlignCenter>false</AlignCenter>
		<AlignRight>true</AlignRight>
	</Label>

Note that it's right aligned.

And, finally, a % sign

	<Label item ="SDK_XPPercPercLabel">
		<!--<Font>3</Font>-->
		<RelativePosition>true</RelativePosition>
		<Location>
			<X>45</X>
			<Y>78</Y>
		</Location>
		<Size>
			<CX>10</CX>
			<CY>12</CY>
		</Size>
		<Text>%</Text>
		<TextColor>
				<R>200</R>
				<G>200</G>
				<B>200</B>
		</TextColor>
		<NoWrap>true</NoWrap>
		<AlignCenter>false</AlignCenter>
		<AlignRight>false</AlignRight>
		<AlignLeft>true</AlignLeft>
	</Label>

When you add these, you also have to add the following lines
in the playerwindow element -

		<Pieces>SDK_XPPerc</Pieces>
		<Pieces>SDK_XPPercLabel</Pieces>
		<Pieces>SDK_XPPercPercLabel</Pieces>

Rinse and repeat for AA xp.

This is from memory of what I did to mine.  I actually
edited my group window to have my health with my groupmates
(so they are listed in order) my mana/fatigue, target name
and health and my xp/aa percentages.  By getting rid of the 
invite/disband/lfg buttons my window is just barely bigger
than the default window, but I can close the player window and
target window and save all that space.
