Advancement has *nothing* to do with competition.

Get over it.

People play EQ to advance or to socialize (or both). Period.

The people socializing don't have need for pp. So the people buying pp 
are using it to advance. To measure ones advancement one watches the 
numbers go up. From your FR, to your FT, to your AC... to your PP.

/yawn
Patently obvious.
And still patently irrelevant.

The world of economics has existed largely in the electronic domain for 
decades now. That may be a revelation, but its one you should have had 
20-30 years ago.

EQ however, by its premise as a virtual fantasy world, is deliberately 
disconnected from it, except that you can take the reigns and control a 
virtual person, move them about, and see through their eyes. The rest of 
the virtual world is disconnected from the real. That disconnection is 
*part of the fantasy*. You can't take your character to New York, you 
can't buy him a McDonald's Happy Meal, and you can't wire him money from 
Western Union.

Taking those barriers down is possible. Nobody disputes that. However 
taking those barriers down ruins the fantasy, and therefore it should 
not happen. EQ isn't the matrix; it doesn't fit EQ.

It is simply a deus ex machina that in archtypical form leaves the 
audience disappointed because it lacks credibility, and the suspension 
of disbelief that makes the whole fantasy enjoyable comes crashing down 
around you.

I'm truly stunned that you can't see that. Or won't.
