Safest would be to buy an account that has a lot of good droppable items and
plat, and a high level of a class that is good at powerleveling.  Then start
an account of your own, twink the hell out of it, and two box for a while,
PLing the new character.  Maybe PL two or three characters.  Then delete
everything on the bought account and cancel it.

The most I'd personally consider buying would be plat and items for
twinking.  I'd do that if I ever decided that I wanted the characters back
from my second account.  I haven't two boxed for a long time, and probably
never will again, so there is just no need for two accounts.  I thought of
moving a couple characters over to the main account...but instead of that,
my current thoughts are that if I ever decide I do want them back, since
they are only low 20's, I'll just start them fresh on my main account, and
use the money that would have been spend moving them to buy them stuff so
they can level up fast.
