Lyrics for those who are interested...

El Condor Pasa

I'd rather be a sparrow than a snail,
Yes, I would,
If I could,
I surely would . . . hmm

I'd rather be a hammer than a nail,
Yes, I would,
If I only could,
I surely would . . . hmm

Away, I'd rather sail away,
Like a swan that's here and gone . . .
A man gets tied up to the ground,
He gives the world it's saddest sound,
It's saddest sound . . . hmm

< instrumental break >

I'd rather be a forest than a street,
Yes, I would,
If I could,
I surely would . . . hmm

I'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet,
Yes, I would,
If I only could,
I surely would . . .

Away, I'd rather sail away,
Like a swan that's here and gone . . .
A man gets tied up to the ground,
He gives the world it's saddest sound,
It's saddest sound . . .

< instrumental break >

I'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet,
Yes, I would,
If I only could,
I surely would . . .

Yes I would . . .
