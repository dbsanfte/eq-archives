Fishing is considered by many to be a tradeskill now, given all of
the items you can make with it.  It is, as you say, level limited,
which makes it different from the standard tradeskills, but it
otherwise fits the tradeskill model in the game.  Even just using
Fishing to fish is similar to doing a tradeskill:  "combine" bait
plus fishing pole in a body of water to (maybe) "make" fish.  Not
identical to be sure, but similar.  But the kicker is that the
manufacture of player-made fishing tackle is implemented identically
to "standard" tradeskills.
