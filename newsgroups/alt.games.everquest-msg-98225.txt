Question do you need the Str and AC of the Mask. Weapons I would look for a
Veilum weapon of Some sort just because they are magic sells for 5-10p very
common drop in velious they are given away or left to rot. Dropped Velium
Weapons won't Proc (Velium Shards 12pt dd) till 25, but the Vendor purchased
models do proc at level 1 Dagger cost me 80p. Weapons damage don't really
start taking effect till after level 20.
