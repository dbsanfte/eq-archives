Only a problem if you have to kill the Gorangas yourself, but they are 
left to rot with regularity. Your biggest problem will be beating other 
twinks to it. :) It's not a hard area to reach, and at 30 you can take a 
couple of licks from a Goranga until a successful Feign. After that, 
it's just a matter of being patient.
