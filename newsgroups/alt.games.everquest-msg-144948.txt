Next time you are at the Bazaar check the prices on Silk, primarily
silk swatches if you can find them.  They are running up to 400pp per
stack, sometimes as high as 600pp and people are buying them.

Leather Padding is just as bad.  100pp per stack was standard.  I sold
2 stacks of them for 600pp per stack and I was on the low end up in
Bazaar.  While not as easy to make as Silk Swatches (which are 2
unstacked spider silks combined in a Tailoring kit - it is a no fail
combine), they only trivial around 40 tailoring skill and are made
from spiderling silks made into silk threads (2 silks make a thread)
and a LQ pelt from old world mobs.

It's insanity I tell you.

Very true as the place to hunt, but minor correction in that they can
drop up to 8 silks at a time.  Only had it happen a few times
but.......

Although almost always camped, the Ice Giants in Everfrost are good
too.  Best if you have a couple people doing it so one can hold the
camp while the other sells.  Selling FS and items we made good exp and
just under 800pp in  a little under 3 hours.
