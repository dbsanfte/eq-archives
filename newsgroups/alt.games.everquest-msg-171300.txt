If you are forcing "no religion," is that any better than forcing any
specific religion?  Atheism is a religious belief, specifically that there
is no god.  Forcing a child to adopt the trappings of atheism (calld
secularism to make it go down better) is no better than making a child wear
crosses and pray to Jehova.  Either way, it's a potential assault on their
religious beliefs.

But then, there is religion in schools, which is what jodakim seems to be
railing against.  I agree with you on this point, BTW.

I think you know better.  It doesn't have to be that extreme to be the
agenda of the radical left.  It's a matter of what's emphasised, what isn't
taught (ie, the opposing opinion), which opinions and attitudes are
rewarded, and which are attacked.  Stuff like how Columbus is now shown to
be a religious biggot and how he intentionally introduced disease to the
"peace-loving" native americans.  I'd like to think that you accidentally
left of a smiley.

You ever try to get a union teacher fired?  It pretty much takes a sex
scandal.  I've got three teachers in my family (my aunt, uncle, and cousin),
all three of which are more moderate than myself.  I get to hear the horror
stories.

I may not agree that there's nothing wrong (personally, I don't give a
flying f'sk, but there are many who do think it's wrong).

Jodakim disagrees that there is nothing wrong.  My part about the
homosexuality and the radicalism is more to make the point that jodakim has
no more a right to not have to see religion than I have a right to not see
homosexuality or hear the preachings of the radical left.  Why is it only
wrong when it's the christians doing it (or in this case, the religious, but
I imagine it wouldn't be an issue if it were muslims or hindu worshipping,
it would then be called "multiculturalism").

Not really.  I'm just showing the hypocracy of those who would force
religion out of school.
