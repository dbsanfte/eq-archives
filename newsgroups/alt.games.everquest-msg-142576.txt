Give it a chance. Check out the bazaar. If there's enough people selling
paddings, pelt or silks, you might be able to just buy everything. Hell,
I found 1 vendor with 30 griffene bloods (for human plate) at 50pp each
which I was farming at 1 per 1 or 2 hours on average. If you find
someone with 100s of the farmable reagents, buy em up and use em.

+5%  =  Geerlock Hammer
Tinkered - lots around, 250ish pp in bazaar usually

+10% = Massive Girdle of the Forge
Not seen it drop, but have it on good authority it comes from one of the
Preats in Seru. Large races only though

Massive Girdle of the Forge

+15% = Hammer of the Ironfrost
Drop from Xerk the Creator in Ssra. Not particularly common drop from
him either. We've gotten like 10 hategivers and 3 Hammers or something.
It's also got pretty nice ratio/stats itself heh

Got a feeling the 'tradeskill trophies' have a 5% mod on them too, but
since you realistically need to have 252 to make them in the first
place, it's kinda pointless.

Testing seems to show that tradeskill mods DON'T stack, and both hammers
are PRI only.

167 + 5% = 175
160 + 10% = 175
153 + 15% = 175

All rounded down as VI seems to prefer.

I've got 221 base skill (rushed to get the final 10 points or so in the
week before the patch heh) with the 15% hammer, giving me 254 skill (max
is 252)

Oh, and just a word of warning. A ranger in my guild tried making his
second 1hs last night. Failed on first combine at 175 skill (was
trivial) then was successful on his second combine. Trouble is, the
weapons are lore, so the sword poofed. /wave 4 tempers ><

Also (before anyone asks) these mods ONLY effect your combine/fail
ratio, and do nothing for skillup rate
