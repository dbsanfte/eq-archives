I guess here it depends on server...BA Halberds are often well below 2k on
Bristlebane but over 3k on FV. I was thinking of BB's prices I am hard
pushed to think of a droppable 2hder that hits as hard for a 45+ Character.
Yes the proc rate on the Halberd isn't that good but I wasn't really
thinking of that as a selling point more the fact that it is at worst a
40/48 and at best a 44/48 weapon.
For the price I can't think of anything close, in fact the only one I can
think of is an Argent Protector, 40/49 but I normally see those in the 4k +
mark
I imagine the BA Halberd costs more to make than it now sells for so you
won't see too many getting made but I still see plenty of people desperate
to sell.

On a side note, my Ranger (on Bristlebane) wields a BA Rapier and BA
Battleaxe and they proc plenty, it seems to just be the Halberd that is a
bit naff...probably has the same proc rate it's just more than twice as slow
as the Rapier.
