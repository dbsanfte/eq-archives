I took my 51 enc and 50 druid to CT to farm stuff (seriously underutilized
zone...I don't take any spawn that an experience group wants) thinking it'd
be as easy as SolA is...after all, they're both aimed at the same level
player.  And hell, lizards generally leave you alone if you're too high,
unlike SolA!

Oh, I died...both my characters did.  Lizard bastards.

I learned not to underestimate CT.
