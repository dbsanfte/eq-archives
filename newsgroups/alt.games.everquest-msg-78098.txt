Same here, seems that there are conflicting opinions.  One theory I have
heard is that it is broken because for some reason you stop targeting the
required NPC in BB with the ! in front of his name.  They say they got it to
work by making sure thye kept him targeted.  Whether this is true or not I
don't know as I haven't tried it myself.  Why they took it down?  Well apart
from the fact it could have just been a bug, there is also the problem of
economics.  Ghoulbane 8 months ago was worth an average of 1200pp on my
server, if not more.  Now it is worth 400pp or less.  VI said the main
reason they didn't want the quest in the first place was so that this
wouldn't happen, as GB was apparently a highly sought after item and was
good for the 'economy'.

The simple way to fix it is just to make it so only Paladins can do the
quest.  Sure it is not going to stop its exploitation completely but will
limit it greatly, besides the fact that I think the damage has already been
done anyway.

And be prepared for a long one, sometimes it can be days before he drops it.
And then there is the role-playing aspect of this too, which is the entire
reason the quest was put in - so you didn't have to kill another Paladin
(because the Shin Lord is a Paladin himself).
