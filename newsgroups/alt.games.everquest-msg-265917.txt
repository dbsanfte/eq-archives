There was an ingame reasoning going on for the Mith Marr encounter.
First none of the Gods in the lower PoP are the true forms, just
avatars. Secondly Mith Marr viewed the trials and finally the final
battle as challenges to honorably overcome. Basically beating his
avatar was a sort of proving ground for getting the information from
him.

On the other hand, if its a paladin of Tunare beating her down along
with the rest of PoG, then yes, there's a problem.
