For the sub 50 levels h2h actually caps 'lower' than monk weapon skills.
Stupid I know. Monks sub-50 using h2h are probably just pracicing to
keep the skill up. There are easy to get decent weapons that are MUCH
better than h2h. For instance the simple fighting baton 8/20 1hb is better
than the h2h up until about level 45. h2h doesn't reach the level of the
weapons skills until like 56 I think.

A lot of decent h2h weapons were added with Luclin but the fact
remains that the skill caps lower.
