<SNIP ad>

mhh. This strikes me as an ad. The entire post consists of the subject
line, and the body is entirely commercial ad. The only thing
distinguishing it from definite spam, is that the subject line is
actually somewhat related to the news group.

So, if you are the OP reading this, try a post with a few lines of
personal text, and if possible a way to post your message without an
ad footer - people will be much more likely to respond.
