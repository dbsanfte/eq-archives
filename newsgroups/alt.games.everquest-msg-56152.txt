Forgot - there are people who take offense to people who "top-post", so 
when you reply to someone's message, you should put your reply below their 
quoted text or interspersed within their quoted text or you will eventually 
be asked to not do it or you will get flamed, depending on the tempermant 
of the person offended.

Some others will also take affront to changes to a total change of the 
subject within a thread.

Neither of these things bother me, but be aware! =)

Good luck, and remember... Gnomes Rule!
