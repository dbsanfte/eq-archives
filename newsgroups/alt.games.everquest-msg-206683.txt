Some others here have given some good advice, but ill throw my 2
coppers in as well. At level 30, you probably wont make much money
advertising buffs. People donate small amounts for the good high level
ones, so I doubt many will give anything for the lower level buffs (as
it sounds like you found out).


The bazaar is your friend. You can make piles of cash easily here. Im
really amazed at what sells here. Stuff that you would think is utter
trash will sell here amazingly enough.

Farming tradeskill items is one idea. While the value of items changes
frequently with the influx of new items, tradeskill items always are
in demand. Spider silks are easy to farm and turn a quick profit.
Pelts go quickly too. While you are spending time in the bazaar, get a
feel for pricing of items. Once in a while, you will see someone
selling something dirt cheap, that you can purchase and resell for a
good profit, but do your homework, or you might lose money doing this.
Often, if you DO find an item thats cheap that you know you can resell
for higher off of someone, check the rest of thier stuff, the other
items could just as well be bargains. Save all the pages, words and
runes and resell those in the bazaar. Just check the npc vendors and
see what they will give you and make sure you sell them for more than
you can get. This applies to many items. For example, if you ever loot
a Forest loop say, dont sell this for less than 250pp or so, which is
what a npc vendor will give you for it.

Now that items will be displayed with a tradeskill tag, you can save
all those items you loot and resell. If you are not sure of the price,
check the other player vendors and price around them.

When a new zone comes into play, usually the drop rate is pretty high
when its new. Someone here mentioned hunting in Dulak. When that zone
first hit the servers, I was making an easy 1k in a short time hunting
here. Theyve since nerfed it a bit.

At level 30, your choices of zones is somewhat limited. Rath mountains
is a popular spot to farm plat, but you arent quite ready for that
zone yet, unless you are in a good group. Crystal caverns is a fun
zone and quite profitable. Blocks of velium drop here at the entrance
and those sell quite nicely in the bazaar. Deeper in, the spiders drop
crystaline silks which also sell well and the geonids will drop some
nice gems. South Ro is an excellent place to farm as it is usually
empty. Sometimes, a group will be camping the AC there, killing
everything in sight and quite often not looting anything and you can
just go around and loot all the silks and terrorantula silks (which
sell even better than silks).
