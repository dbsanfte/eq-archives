The good part of this quest is that if you have a friend with the right
faction, he can do the quest and you can loot.  Aside from the faction,
the quest is not very hard.

Its my experience that its not a fixed 20%, but random up to 20% with
rounding of some kind to the nearest tick.  What this means for most of
my dots is that I see an increase in duration by 0-2 ticks.  Woot?  It
also doesnt work on tap dots, which sucks.
