You know how F1 is you and you can use the F keys to target players in
group.

Is there a way to create a hot key to do that? For example I want to create
a button that assists the F2 player in a group always.

/assist F2

or something like that? so you dont have to change it everytime you want to
change your assist, you can create 5 assist hotkey buttons. Could also be
usefull for buffing and healing etc...
