At those levels Ixi can be a real pain in the ass. My last guild, when I
was much lower level, tried him a couple times and wiped horrendously
with a few groups of low/mid fifties.

Piece of advice number one echos what Martin said. Beg, borrow, or steal
a warlord or other well equipped, high MR/FR tank. It will make all the
difference in the world. Keeping such a tank alive will be an easier
chore for your clerics.

This is a mob that you will want to set up a CHeal chain on for a guild
at your level. If your clerics aren't used to doing that, get them
practicing early. Set them up in their own channel with hotkeys talking
in that channel. The hotkeys should say something like "CHeal on MA. Bob
is next." followd by /cast 1. (Or whatever spell gem your CHeal is on.)
Then three or four seconds later, Bob hits his that says, "CHeal on MA.
Jane is next." etc. etc. The key thing is, you are always casting the
next CHeal before the last one has landed. Having shammies and/or druids
spamming the MA with CHeals at the start of the fight until the CHeal
rotation gets in gear is also A Good Thing.

Mage fire pets are your friend. They will not take the AoE damage, and
will keep doing damage as long as the MA is standing.

Highest possible MR/FR for everyone is vital. Push everyone to invest in
a good set of resist gear, and if you dont' have a druid with Circle of
Seasons, bribe one to come buff the raid. All other top line Magic and
Fire resist buffs are the order of the day.

Mostly, it's about DPS. Get everyone in behind the mob except the MA
(after MA has established aggro, of course) and just gang bang Ixi for
all your are worth. Kill him fast or your casters and lower AC/HP
raiders will be toast, and so will you.
