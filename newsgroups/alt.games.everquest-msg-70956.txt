I'm of the opinion that Verant fucked up, in their timing, though not
in the technology. The game had to move forward sooner or later, but
it seems clear to me that they moved to DX8.1 without themselves
realizing that Win95 wasn't supported until it was too late.

What I can't believe is that anyone is still ranting over it. They
fucked up, but going on about it really isn't going to fix it. What
would you have them do now, after the fact? How do you prove that
you're running Win95 and therefore are entitled to some compensation?
