It's late, and I only just realised what you were talking about... you want
me to upgrade the bizbee quote?

I couldn't have all that swearing as a sig. How about "what goes around,
comes around"... seems to say exactly the same thing Of course the downside
for bizbee fans will be it doesn't have any of those especially witty
"fucks" in it. So it wouldn't be as catchy as;

Or do you think that great philosophers shouldn't be censored at all?

I don't respond to 99.9% of these morons.....    bizbee
