I'd sort of like to get a taste of several different professions//races 
before settling down on one for the long haul.  As a rule, about what level 
would some of you more experienced folks and beta testers say that a 
particular combo should be to get a "taste" of it?

I want to play one long enough to get that "taste", but there's no point 
continuing on if far enough's enough, so to speak.  :-)

TIA
