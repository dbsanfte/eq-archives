No offense taken. My boyfriend and I run 2 computers..one that pretty much just
runs EQ for the time being, which runs off a cable modem, and then there's this
POS.
It's motherboard sucks too much to handle a good LAN card. And rather than
paying for a seperate ISP (since this computer is only really for looking up
quests, and general other web browsing while on EQ), I just comandeered an AOL
account from a friend, since he never uses it =)

Sneaky, ain't I? Good thing I play a rogue....
