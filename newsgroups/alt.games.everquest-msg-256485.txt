In the context of LDoN, no they don't particularly (except as they
happen to have AA run speed but that applies to every class).  Unless
they've fixed the indoors version of Selo's (possible, but I haven't
heard of it), it's a 10% speed boost unmodified by instruments,
i.e. utterly useless.

This does not necessarily mean that you shouldn't click off those
buffs, depending on what else is on offer, of course.
