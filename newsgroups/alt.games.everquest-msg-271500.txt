    There seems to be some sort of "catch up" code, too. I can have my 
trader force feed until unable to do so any more, and within a few days the 
trader will be hungry and thirsty when leaving trader. During those few days 
I'll spend at most 90 minutes outside of trader logged in - too short a time 
to go from "stuffed, can't eat any more" to "need food and water badly". My 
sneaking suspicion is the code for not eating and drinking just disables the 
auto-eat and messages function, but does not fully disable the "do you need 
to eat" timer.
