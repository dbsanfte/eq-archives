I have heard of people filing lawsuits against proprietors of recreation
sporting leagues for unjust season and lifetime ejections.  I know one of the
reasons was involving slander which, as people don't outright know your real
identity, I don't know if that would apply.  But I happen to see no real
difference on being banned from a sports league or being banned form EQ, UO
or AO.  If you can sue for one, you should be able to sue for the other.
