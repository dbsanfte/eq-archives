   And also Charon.  I just KF them both.  I guess he's pissed so
many people to KF him that he just wasn't getting the response he
needed.

   As an aside, I don't think that he's just a jerk.  I think he
has real medical problems.  I think that back in the old days
they would have been drilling holes in his skull to let the
demons out.  Whatever.  He's the first person I have _ever_ KF. 
My reader ignores every post he start.
