There's always the popular Paludal caverns on the moon where you can level to about
26, I think.  Exp is real good there, with about a 20% bonus, as I recall.  Merchants and
banking are convenient as ShadowHaven is adjacent to it.

People usually bore of Paludal after four or so levels there.  On the other hand, you'll probably
not have a problem finding a good group there, and that can be half the fun of the game.
