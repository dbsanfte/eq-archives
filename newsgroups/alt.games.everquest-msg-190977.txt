I'd suggest tailoring first, since low level tailoring uses primarily
pelts and silks that you will loot in the normal course of hunting at
those levels. You can get your first couple dozen tailoring points 
with little cash expense. In the long run, tailoring takes an enormous 
amount of time and effort to raise to grandmaster levels, though.

Tailoring also trumps all other trade skills in terms of low-level
profitability due to the high player demand for leather padding
(made from spiderling silk and low quality pelts, and doesn't require
a huge amount of skill). Leather padding is a required component 
for most all high level blacksmithed armor.
