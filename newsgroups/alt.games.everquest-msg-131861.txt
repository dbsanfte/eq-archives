    First we need to assume you're being rampaged when you say you are, and
not lagging. I can take your word on that. Then we need to assume that
nobody that is ahead of you on the rampage list has moved back into range.
That's a big one - were you on rampage from the start of the encounter? If
not, who had rampage before you and how did they lose it? When you lost
rampage, who got it? Frequently when we see rampage "bounce" it's because
someone near the top of the rampage list moved in/out of range, or because
the rampage taker became the main tank.

    If you'd like to play with it, there's apparently some nice easy mobs in
Tenebrous Mountains that rampage. Set up your order of aggro so someone that
will do nothing other than tag the mob second is the second person to aggro
the rampager. Then have the first person to aggro it gain aggro, and watch
to see if the second person ever gets off rampage. (So have the main tank
pull, and some random_melee plink it with an arrow as it's incoming then
stand around near the mob but not attack it.) If what I've said is correct,
the random_melee will never leave the rampage list. This is the experiment
we ran on a somewhat-higher level mob ;-) and that's what we found:
regardless of what that rampage tank did, as long as he stood there he takes
rampage.
