Well, I haven't played a druid that high of a level, but I can tell you that
when my first character (cleric) also hit 16th level, I had a similar
problem.

For many, I think that's about the time your lack of melee skills as a
wisdom caster start getting you really killed, where before they could kind
of get you by once you went oom.  My cleric worked Oasis for a long time at
16th, and hardly got anywhere.  Then while travelling, he got killed by
Dragoon Zylt twice in the same night, and all that hard work went bye-bye.

Moved to Highpass, found some good groups, and made 20th before I knew
it.....

I think the difference for me between Oasis and Highpass, is that in
Highpass, I ususally had full groups, constant pulls, good organization, and
definate boundaries.  In Oasis, there was lots of open room (in a bad
sense), lots of train and SG/Spectre add-ons possible....and for some
reason, picking up a well-organized, full group seemed to be more difficult.

For some reason, I also felt more confidence in my fellow group-mates in HHP
than in Oasis.  Less confusion = less disasters.  Grouping in Highpass felt
like a well-oiled machine.   Grouping in Oasis felt like constant
crisis-management.

Don't know where you're adventuring, but those were my experiences when my
first character got to 16th....
