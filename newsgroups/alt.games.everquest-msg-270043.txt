You've hit content I haven't hit as of yet, then (my understanding is that
elite quests are plainly marked as such, and that I haven't accidentally
stumbled across one I wasn't aware of).  My main is still combing the desert
( "... he said 'Comb The Desert', and that's exactly what we're going to do
... comb the desert!" .. a vague Spaceballs reference just popped in my
head), looking for raptor nests and such in the Barrens.

The hazards of only playing a couple of times a week for a couple of hours
each session ... and being a bit of altaholic. ;-)
