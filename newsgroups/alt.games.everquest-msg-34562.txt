Untrue.  I'm sure -she- has "tattled" on other violations and never once
mentioned it here.  I, myself, have "tattled on some names that have
richly deserved whatever attention I can call to them, but have only
mentioned a few here.  Of course, I have never started my own
thread about it.  Maybe I'll start doing that since I know it entertains
you so much.

Yes.  Quite a few of us like (and want) to here more things like this.

Now don't go and get me all excited about her ass..

Sadly, I don't think the majority of name violations are newbies.

As stated earlier, a lot of us don't think it's a waste of bandwidth.
If you don't like it, don't down load the message body.  If you think just
the headers are a waste, kill file Lokari.  If you don't want any of it, PLONK
the whole thread.  You have a wide verity of filters and rules available to you
within OE 5.5x.  You might try using them.  It may lower your stress level.
That and decaf.
