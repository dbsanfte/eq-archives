I don't know if kei is level dependent, but sow potions are.  Give a sow
potion to a level one character and it will last much shorter than the 36
minutes it is supposed to.  I think it scales up to normal time at 10th
level.  I'm sure you must be aware that they do the same thing with stats of
high level equipment.  So knowing that the implementation is practically
already done, I am lead to believe that they could do that but chose not to.
