Actually, this part of the nerf, I think works.  I don't think it really
hampers the wizards too much (disclaimer, I've never played a wizzie, so I'm
sorta talking out my arse), while actually adding risk to the reward.
Basically, it mitigates the worst excesses, while not really hampering
wizards from doing what they're meant to do.  It's the mod rod nerf that I
think is utter bovine scat.  In this case, it hampers wizards and clerics
who are actually trying to do thier jobs.  Like hell it was unbalancing, it
was the -only- way to balance the players with the overpowered MoBs in the
high game.

Granted, I love to see the uber guilds squirm a bit, but if they can't
accomplish what they honestly -should- be able to accomplish, somethings
wrong.

The only good thing I can see about the mod rod nerf is it makes bards even
more godly (bard mana -always- stacks).  Of course, that means more idiot
bards, which means SOE will make them easier to play for the great unwashed
masses, which means SOE will curb their power... maybe that's not such a
good thing.
