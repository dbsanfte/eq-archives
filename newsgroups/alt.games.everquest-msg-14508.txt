*grin* Skeleton pets are fun, eh? One of them saved my butt three
nights ago - his owner went link dead while we were killing walruses,
but good ol' bone boy stuck around long enough to beat a walrus to
death. I was hurting and LOM so I didn't really mind that he ended up
KSing me before he poofed :)
Two nights ago, said friend with pet had been soloing man o wars in
Eastern Wastes at that spot and came to Dreadlands to give me a
present - Ro's Fiery Sundering. I can get fire spells to stick now!
And last night, a friend I haven't seen in six weeks is playing again.
We talked about stuff, he told me he'd just gotten a dark ember for a
rez and that he also had a bone club of garou. Then, he tells me he'll
give me the club until I get something better if I spend a little time
powerleveling his alt. So, I now have a 7wis weapon and will spend a
couple nights making cured silk and baking as I watch over his monk :)

Combined with all the people who have told me the past couple days
that they'll take me on raids once I get 5 more levels under my belt
(not just my friends either, someone from a guild with few druids said
I can tag along with them to fear etc if I want to when I get 46+) and
dinging 41 last night, things are going pretty good in game :)

On the downside, our lead GM Valtron left last night (Who knows how
the replacement will be?) and oddly enough, as soon as he said goodbye
in a serverwide message, everyone in Dreadlands started getting
horrible lagspikes and it stayed that way the rest of the evening. At
one point, I got a text message about a mob being snared before even
beginning to hear the sound of spellcasting.
