That's not a quest. You enter the sarnak fort in LOIO and kill the Chancellor
Di'Zok. He mostly carries that spear (and if he does you see it in his hands).
He's about level 40, get some high level friends to kill him for you :)
Don't expect any *stranger* to hand you a weapon worth thousands of plat :)
And honestly, most weapons that aren't valuable just more or less suck. I
used a sap of piety at your level, that I was given to free by a passing friendly
stranger. It doesn't really matter weather you get good at piercing or not
early .. you won't  be a melee very fast anyway and our epic's effect is
not a proc, but a clickable.
