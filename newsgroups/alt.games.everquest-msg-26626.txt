There is certainly nothing wrong with asking for a SOW.  I think a lot
of druids/shamans just get fed up with people who:  1) can't be
bothered to actually spell out their request (sow plz), 2) DEMAND a
SOW (give me SOW!), 3) expect them to run all the way to the other
side of the zone to SOW them, or 4) go up to them when they're right
in the middle of a fight and ask, when obviously the SOWer has their
hands full.  However, I think if you went to a SOWer who was sitting
around not obviously busy fighting or whatever and then said to them
something like, "Pardon me, but if mana permits, could you give me a
SOW?", they won't mind giving you one--they might even be pleased that
somebody actually made their request in a complete sentence and give
you a few extra buffs as well!
