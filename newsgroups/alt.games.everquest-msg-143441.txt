You can join any existing chat channel by typing in
/join channelname
If it's password protected, you'll need to add the password after a
colon with no space, like...
/join channelname:password

In the case of channels that are shared across all servers, (e.g. the
one I mentioned for this newsgroup) you have to start with serverwide
and a period. This channel has a password (mostly so it will remain
persistent for 24 hours when nobody's in it than for any other reason)
so you type..

/join serverwide.age:age

There's no way to get a list of all active channels that I know of,
other than asking around, but most servers have some common ones, like
one for each class (e.g. /join wizard) and some others like auction,
taxi, and rez.

You can set up to join any channel you always plan to be on by using
autojoin. If you want more than one, you separate them by a comma. So if
you want the age channel and your servers necro channel (let's say it's
called "necro" to be original and had a password of "dead") you would
type...

/autojoin serverwide.age:age, necro:dead

Now, every time you log on any character, you will autojoin those two.
You can leave them at any time, or join others. There's a list of chat
commands in /help in the game for more details.

It all depends on your individual tastes according to your class. Some
necros put a big weight on HP because they figure to duke it out once in
a while alongside their pets. (I never understood that) so they might
want to pick up some gear with HP. However, at your level I would say
+Mana items are the best, (You don't get as much Mana from INT as you
will later on) with INT second in line. Later on, when you are in your
forties and above, you'll want to be sure to get your INT near max (255)
before worrying too much about more +Mana items. Focus effects can be
VERY powerful, and if you find items that have them which apply to your
class and can afford them, it's often worth equipping them. (Reagent
conservation, in your case, is kind of a dog since you're just saving a
bone chip in most cases) but getting improved affliction and damage
focus items could be a big boost. They also tend to be more expensive,
so they might not be realistic for you. Also remember that Focus Effect
level I items only work on spells up to level 20 (or is it 24? something
near there). Level II only work up to level 44 spells. Level III will
work on spells all the way to sixty. They get progressively more
expensive, so level II will see you fine for a long time to come.

When you narrow your search like I said, the defaul should be to list
all of the matching criteria items in alphabetical order. Not sure if
you can list them other ways, but it would be nice. I tend to just go
through and click on things based on the price range that I'm looking to
buy in, or maybe a name I heard mentioned, and check the stats. Your
first couple times through, you may want to click on all of them and
look at the stats. Could give you a good feel for whats' out there for
the future.

Don't know. I'll have to look into that myself, and maybe others here
can answer as well. I'm just so used to it now that I don't notice when
I'm browsing.
