The official word is that your characters will be saved for three
months. No longer is guaranteed. But, I have yet to hear a credible
account of a character being deleted because an account was closed.
People have come back a year and a half after quitting and still found
their chars intact.

In order to find out when your current billing cycle ends, you should
contact customer support directly.
