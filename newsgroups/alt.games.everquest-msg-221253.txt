If you don't like the new systems, don't use them.  Do you sit on the dock
and wait for the boat from BBM to FP still?

Seriously though, I can see you point to a certain extent...it's irritating
that, after building my characters up, newbies start out with their items
equipped, a backpack, full stack of food, etc etc...  On the other hand, if
I feel like starting an alt to play with some friends, I don't want to have
to go put up with all the trivial BS (boats for the most part) just to do
so.  A lot of the time savers were put in place as a convenience to the
people who have already gone through the bs, newbies just got the benefit
too.
