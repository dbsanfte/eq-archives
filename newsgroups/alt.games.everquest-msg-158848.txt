This is interesting.

I'll admit that I don't have a LOT of experience grouping, but even I know
better than this...

As a Druid in a Group, I find that the following is usually my list of
responsibilities.

1) Mem an acceptable succor, and keep enough mana to us it at all times
2) Ensnare every mob and make sure it stuck.
3) Every new battle, Damage Shield the tankers.
4) Keep sow or wolf form up on the pullers, and if possible, on everyone.
5) Heal on occassion
6) Meditate to make sure you have the mana for the other duties.
7) Debuff mobs if it's a tough one, and if you have the appropriate spell to
do so. (Like Fixation of Ro)
8) Burn the mob in an emergency.

The Druid burn is decent, and great if you solo, but is simply not efficient
enough for grouping.  Every time I've decided to burn a mob, I have to
scramble to get the mana back to keep up my other duties, which were doing
the job just fine.  One damage shield on the right tank is much cheaper, and
much more effective.

We have pretty good dots as well, but generally I've found that battles
don't last long enough to make them efficient.  In any event, a Druid burn
is WAY down on my list, to be used only if a mob manages to break away, is
low on health, and is going to cause a train if allowed to escape.  I've
usually considered Druids that burn regularly as hot doggers.  The only
exception to this I can think of was back when I was hunting in Burning
Woods with Janey and Davian and some others.  At the time my anti-summoning
line worked on the hornets, and as such it was a VERY efficient DD spell,
about as good as a Wizard's.  I was a bit more likely to burn them, since my
spell was so efficient against them.

Still, I'm not that experienced, maybe I just haven't been in the situation
where a Druid should reasonably cast DD spells yet.
