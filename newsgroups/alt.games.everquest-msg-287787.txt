	Ok, Butcherblock where the dwarves live and the only casters
are goblins and a few dead chesspieces has a druid circle.  Steamfont
which has a few gnomish wizards and the like has a druid circle.  Loping
Plains, which is full of orcs and werewolves, has a druid circle, but at least
some of the treants are druids so maybe their relatives from Nightmare
drop in on weekends.

	Faydark, which is FULL of druids and wizards...doesn't have a
druid circle.  Ok, maybe no one ever wants to go there except for wood elves
but it does seem wierd that they've got all those druids yet can't bother to
kick the skeletons out and polish up a few stones...
