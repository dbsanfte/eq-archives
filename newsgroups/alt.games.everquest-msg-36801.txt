"still"? You will probably "still" be wearing that armor at 46. There's
nothing wrong with this, it is incredibly good armor for level 32.

Um, yikes! I remember when my warrior was trying to solo around level
18, 19. 20 minutes downtime to heal back is not fun... I hate to break
it to you, but I don't think soloing to level up is going to help any;
you're just going to get more hp which will mean even longer downtimes.
Warrior is really a group class.

Have you tried Rathe Mountains? some dungeons? Dalnir is a good one at
your level, as is SolusekA, Permafrost (this will probably be deserted
though, except the alchy camper), UGuk, Mistmoore... others come to
mind. Have you been to Velious? lots of good group hunting there at your
level, and it would be a change of scenery from FM/OT.

Well, I don;t think you're going to be replacing your crafted with 1kpp,
but as I said earlier, it doesn't matter. There are probably some
miscelaneous pieces you could replace; crested spaulders come to mind,
if you dont have them; maybe you could join a group in Mistmoore for
those?
