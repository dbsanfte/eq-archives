Now, why would you spend your training points on Hand to Hand or Throwing?
You can easily convince some group or other to let you swing away or whip
stuff at mobs to your heart's content.  I'm willing to let people do it to
my mobs all the time, provided that they don't do more damage than we do -
which is inconceivable with a good group of 6 wailing on the mob in addition
to the person trying to train their skills.

I have a level 30 mage & he has his research skill maxxed by using training
points & still has something like 80 or 90 points sitting around waiting to
be used.  I have a level 36 druid who has some 80 or 90 points sitting
around, too, & that is after wasting some points on Forage cause I was too
impatient to train it up thru practice instead.

I don't know.  Maybe it's just that the friend who introduced me to the game
drilled it into me to save the training points til you REALLY need them & to
train skills up thru practice whenever possible.

Why would you want to learn Orcish (other than for a roleplaying reason)?
Is there any benefit to doing so?  I'm not slammin you for learning it, just
curious.
