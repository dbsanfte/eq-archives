Who said he was obligated? That doesn't mean he's not an asshole for
refusing to help out other players unless they fork over what could
very well be all the plat they have... My necromancer's level 33. She
has about 180pp right now. I have to buy spells next level, plus
scrounge up/buy research words for 2 of my spells ( whoever came up
with the idea for research needs to die painfully ). If I fork over
100pp for a rez, that means I come up short for half my new spells.
Forget about those words.

Yeah, I can get along fine without the rez. But these clerics
demanding outrageous prices for rezzes seem to assume everyone's rich
or something and 100p is nothing for them to pay out.

I know what they'll find

It's what they want to see...
