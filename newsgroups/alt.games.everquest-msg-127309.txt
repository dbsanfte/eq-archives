I'm not really having that problem, but rather at lvl 26 , i'm having trouble finding places to hunt
and get good xp. I've gotten tired of being a speed bump in Unrest and things are in a rut up in
Paluadal. Been trying to got to Kunark, but the damn boats are broken again on Theris-Thule again
and I hate the wait for the port up to the Moon. I can never find someone willing to port me over
there. I feel for you and agree there is a definate lack of undead in Luclin that are in hunting
range of uor levels. Only thing I can suggest is try Mistmoore or Najeria, which is where I may be
headed now.

Good Luck and hunting.
