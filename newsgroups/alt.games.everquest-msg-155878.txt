It sure sounds like an overheated CPU problem, doesn't it? That was my first
suspicion. Nope. CPU runs at a constant 38 degrees Celcius with my
Thermaltake Volcano 7 Plus heatsink/fan and Arctic Silver 2 thermal paste.
So you see? I can think of nothing that could be causing this... I'd still
love any more opinions/suggestions anyone might have. Thanks in advance.
