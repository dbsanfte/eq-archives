That is something I really liked about EQ. With the exception of
mis-allocating your starting stats, you really couldn't screw up your
character beyond a point where it wasn't fixable. Pushing the wrong
trade skill go over 200 is the only thing I can think of--hopefully
you learned the game by then!

I disagree. This only makes sense for (role-playing) magic-users and
healers, but they could easily quest to the level where they get
meditate. From that point on, they normally wouldn't use a weapon in a
group anyway. While low-mid level soloing becomes difficult,
eventually using a weapon while soloing becomes not worth it as well.
