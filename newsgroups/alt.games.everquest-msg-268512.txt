Hey lokari, i really liked that tailoring site btw. I think that the
problems with the last few expansions didn't help; the lore was bizarre
(making roleplaying impossible),  Brenlo directly contradicted promises made
at one convention for improved soloing (eg ldon, tasks) by saying that
soloers shouldn't play eq1 (tick! moved on ) and if you were in a funny
timezone (GMT +10) you could find yourself excluded from grouping because
you didn't have the raiding background (because of timezone) or the grinding
timeto buy 100K+ items in the bazaar.

Before i left, being asked what mana regen total i had was becoming normal.
I couldn't match other people (had coldain shawl 7, something else i recall)
and so people were cutting me out in favour of people who were raiders, or
bought their gear using real cash (had a few friends into that bigtime) or
who just raided green mobs for hours every day. I was finding the mobs were
being redesigned to block soloing (immune to snare, root, or just summoned,
and these weren't named mobs). I felt the game designers didn't want me
playing, so ...

I'm still waiting on my game to be delivered but hopefully I'll see you guys
on AB. Not sure if I want to recreate my monk or druid. If EQ2 doesn't work
out, I'll move somewhere else, but i think the characters i created aren't
defined by gear or what the game allows for the name. Viewed that way, the
characters are portable and there's no reason to hang onto a game which
seems to be represented by bastards like Brenlo.
