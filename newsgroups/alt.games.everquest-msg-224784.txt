Gems which can only be gotten in or via LDoN missions, spells which can 
only be gotten via LDoN missions (except maybe on FV), items which you 
can get without owning LDoN via bazaar, OR by going on LDoN missions.

The transportation system takes you between NRo, SRo, EC (wow those 
three are hard to move between) BB and Everfrost.  Compare this to POK, 
which takes you within a couple zones of almost everywhere?  The Magus 
system might have been a big improvement if added pre kunark, but post 
POP its no more than a footnote.

As a 55 wizard, you find the magus sytem interesting?  Why, because its 
a faster way to get to Everfrost?  No, not even that because you can get 
there by POK book.

I think its a good expansion, adds a fun new approach to play and lets 
me find short term pickup groups, which I've always enjoyed... but thats 
not the same as saying it added something for people who aren't actually 
doing LDoN.

Buying POK without being able to do (or interested in doing) anything in 
POP would still get you the POK transport system, the various very nice 
POP quest items, and access to levels over 60.

Buying LOY got you twice as many bank slots and a very handy cartography 
system, plus added the Froglok race.

SOL got you Beastlords, Vah Shir, and the astounding Nexus transport 
system (astounding then, now its a footnote with POP transport 
available)... and eventually the Bazaar, although that wasn't ready at 
SOL release.

Kunark added levels 51-60, and the Iksar race... you could argue the 
latter wasn't useful if you didn't want to actually play in Kunark.

To find an expansion as useless for people not actually doing the 
expansion as LDoN, you have to look at SOV: this added no new race, no 
new class, no new levels, no new transport system, no map system; I 
can't think of anything you'd get by buying Velious if you weren't going 
to actually play in velious; perhaps Thurgadin as a nice trade skill town.

ps my 65 cleric did levels 2 thru 6 in Eastern Wastes killing snow 
bunnies...
