I use an everquest emulator because my parents no longer allow me to play
everquest. I had some cool online characters but I had to part with them and
went with the emulator. Its pretty cool, my brother and I duel. You can set
it up so all of the mobs are there and have GM powers or just be normal.
Whatever floats your boat. Its pretty cool, if you are interested leave a
message and I will leave a link to the emu.

Ben
