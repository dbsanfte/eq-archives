It has the same resistance table as any other normal nuke . In other words
it works well against mobs not resistant to that type of attack . After a
red wurm has been maloed, tashed , and maybe even sundered I have no problem
landing it for full dammage. My druid is a only level 55 and the mobs are
60-62 so I really dont think it is a problem. If you have problems with it
landing someones doing something wrong :p

Druids at the high end add significantly less utility than some other
classes . This is with out a doubt true and due to all the whining from the
no nothing low levels who cry that druids are so uber, but healing the rogue
is only necessary if the clerics can not keep up :p Some of our members have
multiple characters so it is entirely possible to get the exact number of
clerics we need . (well ok when we tried the 4 cleric and 2 warrior keep the
aggro group we ran a bit short). If your not doing anything else you might
as well nuke . The whole wizard complaint can be boiled down to ; speed is
not important when you must time your nukes so as not to aggro and all
classes with nukes have a similiar ratio of mana to dammage.
