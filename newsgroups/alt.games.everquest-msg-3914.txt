Sure, we necros are the second best soloers in the game.  (Some would say
the best, but ho many Necros do you hear Quad Kiting Yellow mobs?).
However, we pay for it when it comes to grouping and Raiding.

Sorry, but when I go to the Plane of Fear or Hate all I'm ever told is the
following:  No DoTs.  No Pet.  No Loot.  Just be sure to "twitch" the
healers (that means donate mana for those who don't know).  When everyone
dies, you're the last to be rezzed ... I hope it hasn't been 3 hours yet ...
and you're almost always put in the scrub group.

Unless it's to Summon a Corpse, how often do you hear of people ASKING for a
necro to join them.

The game isn't about soloing and who can kill the toughest mob by
him/herself.  It's about having fun and getting together with others to
achieve a common goal (whatever that happens to be for the evening).

I have played every class in the game (some only to 20th level) and I truly
believe that, while YES there's some work still needed to be done to make
every class on par with every other class, every class has its niche and if
you are willing to play in that niche, you'll be happy.  If no, then play a
different class.

Yes, we are powerful soloers (we have to be), but we pay for it in the upper
levels.
