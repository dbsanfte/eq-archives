I don't have the slightest interest in fan faires, keychains, 
bumperstickers, shirts, posters, eq the movie, crappy RTSes, sony 
playstations, eq on my palm pilot and cellphone,  or beta bundles for 
products I may or may not want to play.

Sony might like me to reach the point where I view it as a product 
family but I simply couldn't care less what they want. Though I don't 
object to them coming up with as many products in the 'family' as they like.

But if they're going to persist on bundling, tying, and otherwise 
getting in my face with unwanted junk advertising while I try to play 
the one product they currently make that I am interested in they will 
continue to be on the bottom rung of my list of preferred vendors. And 
the first I drop when something better comes along.
