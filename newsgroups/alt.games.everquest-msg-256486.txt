In any context, "bards run fast" is... somewhat foolish generally.

Regular selos must be maintained, taking at best 1/5th your song output 
to keep up all the time, more likely if you are a bard that hasn't 
figured this out yet its taking 1/3rd your output because you probably 
aren't doing a 5 twist either.

If you don't have it up all the time, then its 3 or four seconds away 
from activation, assuming you don't get stunned while trying to get it 
running.

Further, it occupies 1/8th your total memmed song slots, if it doesn't, 
then it isn't there when you need it.

And its not even all that fast if you don't juggle a drum in on the 
beat, sort of like SOW cast by a level 9 shaman; JBoot speed more or 
less.  This isn't such a huge penalty since the OP has epic, which 
counts as a decent drum, although if he really wants to take off he'll 
probably want to juggle in something with a higher modifier.

Two minute selos is better in that it doesn't eat singing slots, but now 
it eats a regular buff slot, the very thing we are trying to free up. 
If you are assiduous about swapping songs around it doesn't have to eat 
a memmed song slot either, but since few bards have a horse, this -may- 
mean getting caught memming at some point, or going without.

Invis/lev/selo song doesn't let you do anything else, and breaks if 
something that sees invis or already had you on the hate list hits you, 
leaving you visible, possibly falling, and normal PC run speed, very ugly.

As a bard, I'd far rather have any SOW, or run 2/run 3, or heck, even 
JBoots/Tboots on than use selos for normal play of any kind; selos is 
for moving long distances fast, and admittedly there it excells

OP probably has Run 3, as a high level bard with epic, heck, what else 
are you going to do with the first six points of AA?  Plus Run 3 -is- 
(IMO) the greatest single AA a bard can buy.

Pressed for buff slots, I'd generally think long and hard about clicking 
off any form of SOW prior to getting Run 2+; moving faster than mobs is 
rarely a bad idea when things go wrong, particularly for a class that 
wears tin foil shaped to look like plate armor (weighs like plate, 
protects like a cotton Tshirt).  Course once you can run faster than 
mobs innately that frees up a slot, because its rarely important that 
you run a -lot- faster than a mob, and if thats the case, to heck with 
SOW, go Selos, its a special occaision.
