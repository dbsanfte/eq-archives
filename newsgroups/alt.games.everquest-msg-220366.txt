Skill?  You call that skill?  

If I play just about any other game out there I would expect to know
who I am attacking.

If I have two mobs standing very close to me it is easy to think you
are attacking one when you are actually attacking the other ... you
are given no indication apart from a flashing name that, as pointed
out before, is practically useless.  Then the one you are hitting runs
at the cleric and you get a "out of range" type message.  This must
have happened to everyone surely .. you pan around looking for the mob
which SHOULD easy to spot.

IMHO this doesn't dumb down the game in the slightest it just makes it
more playable.

Next think you have to ask is why can't you see blood fly when you hit
a creature so a chanter looking on would know which to mez or the
fighter could reaquire the target.  The only reason is because they
couldn't let under 18's play the game ... it has nothing to do with
realism, playability or any such concerns.

Do I think they have introduced some things over the last year that
dumb down the game?  Sure, but I don't think this is one of them.

Cheers.
