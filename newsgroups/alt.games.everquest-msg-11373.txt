The world can use one less addict. JK. :)  You choose a tough city and race.
They are quite night blind, and the newbie area in Everfrost is tough at
first.
Hang in there with that shaman until at least level 9 when you get SoW (a
faster movement spell.)
You will be very popular, and will make some cash using it if you prefer.

I started with a Barb Warrior over 2 years ago, so I can feel your pain.
You just picked a bad week to
start with a major patch (or 2.)

Hang in there!
