It would make the game a hell of a lot easier...a lot less thought...if my
enchanter could put up 10 spells instead of 8.  Now, I wouldn't complain if
they made the change <g> but it WOULD be a drastic change for me.

Verant recently implied that they had no intention of increasing gems.  It
was on the official board though it might have scrolled by now, and I didn't
notice a way to look at older posts (I didn't search too hard though).
Regarding binding melee, Verant showed MONTHS ago that they were willing to
do something (adding bind points)...adding the NPCs was just the next
logical step (unfortunately not at the non-starting-city bind spots, but
those're probably coming).  Verant stopped saying "no" to melee bind a long
time ago.  They haven't yet stopped saying "no" to gems.
