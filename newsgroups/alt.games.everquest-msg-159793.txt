No, actually.  I've had a horse since a few days
after Luclin was released, and most of the time
horses aren't a problem like this.

Every once in a while they'll act weird, however,
and you'll have to "get off your high horse".  But
the majority of the time you can do transfers
just fine while on the horse.
