Nice choice. Being totally "fubar'd" faction wise in the old world is
not that bad. It opens up a lot of new and exciting hunting
opertunities :-)

Well if you do make it "end-game", the Iksar is still a very good
choice.

Keep your eye out for a post-nerf Circlet of Shadows. It has a
right-click invis that starts to work at level 20 (SKs don't get their
invis spell until level 30). On most servers they go for around
300-400pp. It makes a HUGE difference when travelling. If you have
plat to burn (5-10K), then get the "pre-nerf" version that is
insta-cast.

>5. With the xp penalty of the Iksar SK, #4 above is compounded.

Play to play....not to level, and you won't even notice the exp
penalty.
