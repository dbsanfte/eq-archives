Yeah, a single group like that would do fine there.  I'm still not
sure if the way the mobs look, and the way YOU look is a bug or
design.  Certainly an interesting place to fight.  Be very careful of
adds, and since you don't have an evac, don't get in too deep.  There
is pretty fast respawn, so you'll stay busy.
