Just killed him tonight, hes a total gimp.  I could solo (bot duo) him with
total ease, so Im sure you and your bro can do him.

Toss a malo on, and slow will stick first time.  His ae is a frontal ice
attack, so watch where you stand and it won't even hit you.

The druid tonight didn't track him from the portal, im sure a ranger can
tho.  As for his spawn time - he just seems a super rare random spawn.
