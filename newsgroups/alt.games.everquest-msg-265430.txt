 "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech,
or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to
petition the Government for a redress of grievances."

Straight from the constitution, show me where that separates church and
state, it merely says that Congress cannot make a law that endorses or
restricts what a church does.

It does NOT say that the government can't hold elections there, it does NOT
say that the president cannot attend church, that congressmen cannot attend
church, or that people in government cannot say anything about church, which
is what I would expect from something separating church and state.
