If you're hunting at the fort, there's a safe spot in a corner near a rock
(sorry don't remember which corner).
Although even if you sit here, I'd still recommend the following
suggestions.

If you're hunting the 3 spawn hut like I did, this is a perfect reason to
work on your divination and go camo like I did, hell, even to this day at
level 38 my divination is higher than my conjuration, only recently have I
really been using my conjuration spells again.  (currently 178 div, 146
conj)  I even spent a bunch of training points on spec: alteration back at
30 because it wasn't going up fast enough and I was afraid I was going to
end up with a primary specialization in divination  =P.
(or if you're a wood elf or halfling, use racial hide, just target something
that cons you other than indifferent and con it while hiding, redoing hide
until you're indifferent, blam, you're hidden)
