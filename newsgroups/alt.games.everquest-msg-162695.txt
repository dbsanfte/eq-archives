Very little HP or mana boost.  Resists perhaps.  Defensive table... I'm not on a
plate class table, so you are talking the difference between two ply and three
ply toilet paper, meaningful against old world mobs, sure, but nothing to the
heavy duty (pun intended) sh*t (hammering the pun home) that PoP mobs lay out.

Name a 63rd level cleric spell that isn't 63+ plus to some other class.  Not 64
or 65, 63.  Could be one, after all, I don't have a source that lists spells by
name and class.

Here's my 63 spell list as I currently understand it:

Armor of the Zealot.  Very much doubt anyone else gets this
Catastrophy.  Hmm, PBAOE, could be someone gets this, druids and enchanters
share the cleric PBAE lines?
Hammer of Damnation. No way.
Sound of Might.  Targetable AE Stun.  Chanters maybe?
Kazad's Mark.  Paladins might get this one.  At level 70.
Supernal Light.  Yeah, paladin spell for level 85.

Another source shows Catastrophy at level 64

First I've seen suggesting that, I thought that the idea was that higher level
mobs relative to your level were worth more than they once were.  Would help a
bit if its your way, since killing level 62 mobs just keeps getting easier, not
due to MY level, but due to the levels of those I group with.

Ah, but my complaint is that I leveled rather than concentrate on getting
flagged, and I'm warning people with the same plan (thinking being, get more
powerful, then getting flag will be easier) that it might not be the best plan.

There's blue stuff, but not "nicely blue" stuff.  And at any rate, I'm sure I
can level all the way up to 65 in PoN if I want to... I did levels 2 thru 6 on
snow bunnies way back when, and don't think that going thru level 5 on the
little things was a trivial exercise, I have tenacity!

But there I'd be, level 65 and still only level 62 spells, and no flags.  People
grouping with me expecting a 65 cleric would be getting a 62 cleric with a
higher exp cost!
