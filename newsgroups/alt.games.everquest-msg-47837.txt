That's the bizbee I know and love.  The classic Usenet bash of  "paranoia
and fixation" is one of your corner stones, don't lose it...

That's the bizbee I know and love.  The classic Usenet bash of  "you are
sexually inadequate" yet another one of your corner stones, don't lose it,
either...

That's the bizbee I know and love.  The classic Usenet bash of  "you are
just a little kid" yet another one of your corner stones, don't lose it,
either...

posters ever.  Hats off to you sir.
