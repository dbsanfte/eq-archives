It doesn't help that all the people in positions of power in the US
were making plans to invade Iraq long before 9/11.

Kinda makes the whole charade pretty transparent. At least, everywhere
but in the minds of the portion of Americans who don't seem to be
willing to consider that....

The sad thing is Dan Day and those in power who think like him aren't
safeguarding Americans, they're guaranteeing 9/11 will happen again,
and maybe the next time will be worse. They would do better to look at
the underlying reasons it happened in the first place (which are
*political*, not religious, at their heart, though draped in religion)
and solving those.

At least, better for Americans. Not better for the chickenhawks.

Nope. But then terrorism doesn't have much to do with what's happening
anyways.

The Taliban were swine no one should miss. There is no redeeming
quality in a religious extremist. We're all better off without them.

Iraq's government is not religiously extreme. It's not even
particularly an enemy of the West; it's no coincidence that the US was
supplying it with everything up to and including chemical weapons at
one point (because Iran really *is*; Iran is only a little better than
Afghanistan, since it's not *quite* as exterme). But Saddam is not the
same sort of fellow as the greedy dictators of Saudi Arabia. He isn't
interested in being a US puppet like they were for personal gain. He
actually had thoughts of making Iraq a regional power. That is a
threat to US economic interests in the area, and so Iraq becomes an
enemy.


>Again, all this does not mean I oppose the war. I think it will benefit

It's too soon to tell whether or not Afghanistan will actually feel
any benefit.

The problem is the people deciding who those people are seem to be
making their judgements on things no one else in the world seems to
agree with, and given their public motives are on extremely shaky
ground this isn't a good thing.

Remember the words Pax Americana being tossed around; the strategy of
pre-emptive strikes, especially on targets not established to actually
be threats, will bite the US back with interest and that's no good for
anyone.
