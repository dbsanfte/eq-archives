Ah, gotcha. The meaning of "party line" that popped into mind was the
group phone lines. *shrug* Ah well, Billy, anyone who's actually paid
attention will have seen that I have criticized SOE in the past, I
just don't go in to the rabid slamming. I will flame those who slam,
even if I agree with the basis of the slam.

*shrug* I guess I just tend to try to look at the both sides of
situations.
