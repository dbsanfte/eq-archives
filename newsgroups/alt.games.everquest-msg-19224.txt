1. If you're not bound in Freeport, DO IT.
2. Kill fire beetles till you ding 5, then start looking for orc
raiders in the desert area. Beware of mummies and madmen.
3. Snare is useful for pulls, if only for the ability to outrun a mob
when it turns out it might be too powerful for you. Flame lick
everything you pull, it dots and debuffs. Melee as much as you can -
nuking things to death is NOT efficient at this level and should be
used to soften up mobs rather than finish them off; snare will keep
them from running away from you when they're dying.
4. If you're untwinked, kill spiderlings and get your tailoring to 17,
then start turning ruined pelts into armor. Wolves can be found in EC,
and you might be able to handle the occasional puma at level 6.
