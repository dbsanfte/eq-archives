I don't.  It wasn't KEI, but ports, SoW, and/or breeze/clarity.  About
the only thing that's really changed, IMO, is that Nexus and PoK have
concentrated players into those zones that were spread out before.

Player interaction was obviously part of the design.  Ease of travel
(and the resulting concentration of players) just as obviously
wasn't.  But it is obvious that the player base wanted the travel
restrictions lowered.

About the only thing that has "changed" (IMO) is the "Vision"
has been lost.  I'm not convinced that's an entirely bad thing.
