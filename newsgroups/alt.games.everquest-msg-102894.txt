Ninja looters suck, plain and simple.  As do intentional trainers (although
the "WW to DN" train a bard made on one of the second tier guilds prepping
for Sontalak on Sullon was kind of entertaining to see shots of) or people
that wander in and kill triggered quest people (EG the 10th ring heros).

I've always asked if I can follow a raid in for faction, and said that if I
got agro I'd just stand and die, I was only running up to it at around 50%
and smacking it once or twice with my hammer anyways, (I only purposely pull
agro for my summoning game on raids in which I'm actually a part =P, side
note on game later)  none of them had any problems, and they used /say for
most raid functions, other than /shout for pull messages (multi guild raid
prior to channels), and they also appreciated another person to take people
out afterwards.  Granted, none of them were doing anything more glamorous
than Bjork the cold or that guy with the bow of the huntsman, but had I been
told to go away, I would have simply out of common courtesy, I don't lag
their raids, they don't lag mine.

I really don't see how faction leaching is seen as rude, it's not like
looting where if you take some, everybody else gets less, except as you
mentioned where lag comes in to play, in which case I'm probably not there
anyways.

Bizbee has previously stated that he's an unguilded solo druid, so I would
postulate that his raiding experience is extremely minor, and I would
imagine that most of the things that those of us who do raid regularly take
for granted are foreign to him (granted, I am still learning myself, but
hey, have to start sometime, haven't done any AoE'rs yet personally).  No
offense Bizbee, but that's just the way it seems.

Anyways, about my little "game", on armor farming Kael raids I toss snare,
Ro's sundering and Fixation of Ro on early and then sit down in an attempt
to get summoned fast, however, the game part of it is that I time it after
slow and in such a way that I don't get hit, it's actually quite
entertaining to see everyone like, "hey, you got summoned, why didn't he hit
you?" and I just /shrug =P.  I only do this when it's not going to endanger
the raid though.  Only once has it been a bad idea, I got to tank a (slowed)
poz for about 45 seconds =D, I survived, but the healers were complaining a
bit.  For non-summoners it's also entertaining, I stand/sit really fast and
it keeps trying to walk over to me when I sit (usually don't do this though
because it serves no real purpose, and he doesn't say my name), but then
stops when I stand back up.  Nearly everyone that I've described this game
too has laughed at me and called me suicidal, but I haven't made any corpses
in Kael yet of myself.  (note: poz refers to the protectors inside the
arena, not the ones at the wall)  This game started when on my first Kael
raid I got summoned once and the giant just said "ahh, nevermind" and hit a
monk instead, I try to recreate that effect.
