...assuming you don't have hundreds of thousands of plat to spend, get
a Wurmslayer til level 50.  There are "better" weapons out there but
most of them are level restricted.  And they are level restricted not
only by level written on the weapon discription but also by your
damage bonus.

I say "unless you have hundreds of thousands of plat" because if you
are rich beyond your dreams, go drop 500k or so and get a Sceptre of
Destruction.  You'll draw aggro but then anything you are fighting
will be dead long before that matters anyway.
