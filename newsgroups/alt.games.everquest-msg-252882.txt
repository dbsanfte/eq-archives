How so is monk fighting not learned?  Warriors get hand to hand,
dodge, and every other combat skill a monk has except block.  Monks
learn FD but cannot go berserk; warriors go berserk as an innate
ability but cannot FD.  Monks advance in some of those combat skills
sooner and/or to higher levels, but don't the monks learn those skills
in their guild? My warrior never trained in wearing plate - that's
innate to the class. Taunt used to require training but has become
innate for warriors, but why couldn't a monk shout something to annoy
the mob too?
 
I agree that every class should not be able to learn every skill, but
I find your 'ability vs learned skill' arguement flawed. The only
reason to prevent every  character from being able to train every
skill is so classes MUST depend on one another to some degree.  Every
race and class has a voice they could use to taunt, but only certain
ones can learn to do so. 

If you think about it, why wouldn't a level 65 magician with 350
INTwho can cast Gate, not be able to learn some of the other
(self-only) port spells?  Once he can do the self-only, why not some
of the group versions?  Why can't he learn the level 16 necro spell
Feign Death, when he can learn Cancel Magic, Arch Shielding, and Gate
the same as the necro? Why does the mage get a Pet Reclaim spell at
level 1 but no pet summons spell until level 4 -- and the magician has
better pets than the necros who get their first pet at level 1?  It
boils down to gameplay.
