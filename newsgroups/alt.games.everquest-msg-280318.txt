I just got flagged for PoE,PoA,PoW,all with open raids,being in a
guild with mostly mid fifty characters.
Did you read my initial posting?I repeat:I see open time raids now.

>=P

I know that I got KT flag by just finishing Tipt trial with my
Cleric,while on the other hand my Ranger who has done Smith Rondo
*and* the other 5 trials,but not Tipt cant enter KT.
So back to the original question/statement which was that SOE made
flagging for higher level zones so much easier just to make people 
buy another (crappy) expansion,do you agree or not ?
