where's your citation to prove such a link?  I've shown that there isn't, if
you wish to refute, then do so, but do so as an adult with a well presented
case which is backed up by reference.

If you are still unable to see that a word can be used in both offensive and
non-offensive ways well then you'd better beaver at work so you can go to
the zoo and see the beavers, while you're there you might chase some beaver.
But if you're a pussy and drop the ball when approaching a desirable lady,
guess what you mightn't get much of - pussy so you'll have to play with your
own balls. Because another man is sure to run in and snatch your chance at
snatch.

You see, a single word can be used in a number of ways.  They used to teach
that starting from kindergarten.
