Does it say anything about seeing through illusions as to what your
religion is? Nope. If an ogre could worship Tunare, he'd be KOS in
Oggok. So, a High elf who worships Tunare with illusion:ogre up is KOS
in Oggok. This has nothing to do with the NPCs' response to your race,
they're responding *purely* to your religion. This isn't a bug or a
behavior that is in any way related to illusions...
