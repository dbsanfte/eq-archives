I bought the original Everquest for $9.99 and that included a free month of
play... I'd say buy that and try it out. $10 is nothing in terms of games.
You'll know in that month whether you like EQ enough to stick with it.

It can be loads of fun, and it can be loads of heartache. If you are easy
going and let the disappointment roll of you remembering that it's just a
game... then you will probably enjoy it :)
