Yep.  Silly little item any non twinked Innoruuk cleric
can get in his 20s, and I won't be able to get a snare
item for my 60 cleric... ever, that I can think of.  Not
"drops off a god" not "quest harder than the epic" but
"none in existance"

I know, for roleplaying purposes, the "change summoned
water into beer" item is amusing... but snare is such
an astonishingly powerful spell, particularly in the hands
of a fear caster, that the disparity is mind boggling.  Why
(other than role play aspects,of course) anyone would
ever consider creating any kind of cleric or shaman than
an Innoruuk worshipping one is beyond me.

Of course if I spend the next few months getting a DE
cleric up to planar level, they are sure to introduce a
Brell cleric usable snare item with POP.  If I don't, they
won't bother.
