Monual,

Thanks for the writeup.  You've inspired me; I'm going to see how far I can
solo this ring myself before calling in guild cavalry. Like you, I'll
probably never see the 10th ring - but the 8th or 9th would be good, and
while you can buy better in the Baz that's not the point for me - the fun is
in seeing how far I can go.

Raivenn,
56 bard
