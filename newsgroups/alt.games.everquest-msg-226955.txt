I think we're making two different comparisons here. I was speaking of 
NBG vs. Random on all loot systems and you appear to be talking about NBG 
vs. Points-based systems.

Again, if it is totally random (barring NODROP of course) your level of 
participation would directly dictate your chances of loot awards. That 
said, I'll repeat my sentiment from another thread, I don't think a 
random loot system is the best choice for a guild.

That still doesn't make you any worse or better at it. Your very next 
roll stands just as good a chance as winning as it does losing just like 
everyone else, therefore you are just as "good at it" as everyone else. 
Any streakiness you have to deal with is also experienced by everyone 
else.
