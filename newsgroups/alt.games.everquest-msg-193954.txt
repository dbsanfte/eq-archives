Heh..of course I wouldn't kick 'em out...whatever haste the haster
decides to give, is better than no haste at all.  Obviously the haste
caster knows (or should know) what spell/song is right for a given
situation.  Unless they've proven to be a totally ignorant tool, I'm
going to trust their judgement.  Just speaking as an admitted haste
(melee crack) junkie.
