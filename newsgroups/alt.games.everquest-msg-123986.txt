}yet?

I have periodically seen the "velious in 3 minutes" message all along, but 
the other night I actually saw an "all the others in 5 minutes" message.  
So maybe. :)

}I wound up in Tox this weekend with my warrior when I was trying to
}get to GD. Not only were there not "public annoncements", but that time
}I never even saw the "The Vellius Spires begin to cast a spell" message.
}Just *poof*. "LOADING, PLEASE WAIT. You have entered Tox Forrest."

Heh, I run on the spires, invis and go AFK. if I come back and I'm in 
toxx, I gate back to nexus and try again. :)  You may not see the velious 
spires cast message if you've recently been on a raid or in an AoE group, 
and didn't turn NPC spell messages back on.
