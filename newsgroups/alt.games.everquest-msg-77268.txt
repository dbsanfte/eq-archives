I'm well aware I'm being exceedingly silly with little Neko, but
she is my "fun" character... I'd cry if I died on suiddaru and wasnt
rezzed... well, I wouldnt, but it would suck. On suineko its
shrug, move on, what other craziness can I try?

Anyway, at 21 she has 20% haste, fungi regen and 196 wis with a
pretty decent melee weapon and AC. I dont think suineko-at-21
will compare to legitimate-hard-working-untwinked-druid-at-25 ;)

Sui (What am I doing? I'm MELEEING what does it look like? You
all make too much noise to meditate. Besides, I dont like it. Heal?
I dont wanna! I wanna tank! Look at meee!)

Of course, I have to play with guildies who understand when I want
to behave like that ;)
