Do you ever do new things, or are you just killing the same old mobs
over and over?  For example, I went to help a guildmate kill a quest
mob.  Took two faction hits.  It's a named quest mob, so the faction
hits are probably pretty big.  I know what one of the faction hits is
(and it took me from dubious to threatening), but that one is OK...I
don't care about that faction.

How about the other?  There are two more quest mobs in that quest that
my guildmate needs to kill, but until I find out what that other faction
is, I can't help, because I don't know if I'm going to be screwing up
something I don't want to screw up.
