I see.  So class difficulty is not really, um, class difficulty but
rather ease of getting a group?  So I guess enchanter is a snap too?
I see a lot of brain-dead types going for that one.  And I guess the
really, really challenging classes are the ones who have to solo like
druid, huh?  Never see a moron druid, nope, nope.  And soloing, yah,
that's really tough.  Have to actually target the right mob and all.

Didn't someone complain earlier about stereotyping?  Deny it all you
like, your comments are those of someone with a real hatred for
clerics.  Reminds me of the Alasdair days.

Others have responded to this, but how long would the list be for
things druids have which clerics don't?
