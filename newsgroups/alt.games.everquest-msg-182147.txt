    Considering he was supposed to be in a plane that got shut down
permanently, I'd bet money he wasn't itemized.

    One week.

    The encounter is, however, quite exploitable. During the fight, adds
spawn. The way my guild kills him, you kite the adds around while you kill
him. However, others found out that if you try and kite the adds out of the
area ("the pit") where the fight takes place, they despawn. They also found
out you could pull Rallos Zek to damn near anywhere in the zone, but the
adds only spawn in The Pit. The only really tough part about the encounter
is the adds.

    No, that was a misunderstanding with Martin. Let me clear that up again.

    Kill two specific Decorin guards before they respawn (5 min respawn on
each). This starts the event. The Decorins won't respawn unless you blow the
event, in which case they repop in 20 minutes. Killing them does not start
the event unless the untargettable version of Rallos Zek is also up. He has
a one week respawn. So if you kill RZ, he's gone for a week.

    However, there was a craptastic patch that changed the encounter. The
DoT was bugged so even if you resisted it, the client would still think it
landed. You had to take a piece of HP gear on and off repeatedly to keep
your HPs at the correct number and not die to this. Shortly after this, the
encounter was permakilled.

    When RZ was brought back, there were further changes to the encounter.
RZ was tethered to The Pit, so he couldn't be warped out. The DoT was also
fixed, and the adds were also tethered to The Pit. Sadly, now you can
exploit the adds by standing at the top of The Pit and just outside it and
aggro all the adds into the corner. They can't get to you, but they keep
trying - they're totally neutralized. They also changed the timing, so
instead of getting adds every X seconds until RZ dies the adds now don't
start until he's at 70% health.

    They took RZ down when RZ was brought back tethered to The Pit. I don't
believe the guild alliance used any of the little "tricks" to bring down RZ.
They just sent a wave of humanity at him and completely overwhelmed him.
