Ah, so in other words: Make mages one-dimensional and even more
useless than they seem to be now. Take any challenge out of playing
them and dumb them down until they resemble warriors in complexity.

As it is, 6 of the 7 players I know who played mages to 51+ play
something else as their main now and the seventh would if she weren't
so critically needed for CotH.
