Try Legends for a month... if the server goes down less than 5 times then
yer the luckiest SoB on Norrath, and even with actually having staff GM's
instead of Guides, and then having them online alot more often... if ya even
get one warning about a zone outage or server problem, then yer most likely
working AT VI... then there's the fact that it most likely will happen on a
friday or saturday night... well, ya get the picture.
