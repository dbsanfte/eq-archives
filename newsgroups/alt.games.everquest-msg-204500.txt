I've used it a number of times.  Find something at a good price on
TraderX, notice that TraderX has a _lot_ of items for sale, so many
items that clicking each to check it would be very time consuming,
so check out what she's got in a nice alpha listing with prices via
the search window.  Sometimes you find multiple bargains.
