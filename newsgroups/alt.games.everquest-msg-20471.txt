Well, if other casters are going to get involved, Magicians can summon a
staff with four charges of See Invisible.  It's lore, so you can only have
one at a time.  And of the few magicians that play anymore, most seem to
have a low opinion of the item summons, so you'll have to find one that
actually bought the spell.  It's also one of the higher-level spells.  I
believe the one you need is Staff of Symbols.
