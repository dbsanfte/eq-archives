Compared to most Ldons I did at these levels this is a high dps
group,reason is they have a Shammy for haste,most groups I
did with my cleric were just me and a hand full of melees,maybe
a necro or mage for dps and some limited crowd control and a Bst
for slow.
Level 55 to 60 melees probably dont have much AAs,so a knight
with a WMBS is just as good for damage as a dual wield class.
