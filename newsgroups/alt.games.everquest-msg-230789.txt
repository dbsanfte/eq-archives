Do not buy an account unless you want to get screwed over, buy the latest
box set at your favorite retailer (evolutions?). Look for on that has,
basic, kunark, luclin, velious, pop at a minimum.

Today I would tell people to choose either beastlord, druid, or shaman.
Beastlord if you like to get up and personal with the mobs all the time,
plus at 9 you get a pet, and easy to solo this class. Druid & shaman can
melee early get decent spells and again can solo those early levels easily.
If you have friends that already play, then do anything you want if they are
willing to help you understand the game some. Or if you are pretty fast at
picking up how things work, play and dang thing you want.
Join Firiona Vie server and look me up, knowing though that this server is
different in that you can only have one character at a time.

Don't beg for handouts of cash or items, but asking people for hints and
tips should be ok most of the time. I would play the newbie character at one
of the popular zones on the server you start on, for me at least, I look for
a real newbie to hand off old stuff and I look in the popular zones just
because I am lazy :)
