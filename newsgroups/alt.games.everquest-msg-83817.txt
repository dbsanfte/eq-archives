I can confirm that it's true.  I was in Perma for a Vox raid.  Two
peope got bored and started dueling.  Unbeknownst to me, one died (I
was busy talking to people), and it took his partner a long time to
find me in the crowd (or else he went afk, who knows?)  It was maybe
5-10 minutes after the duel that I got to the corpse and tried to
Revive it and got the "corpse too old" message.

No idea how long it's been like that.
