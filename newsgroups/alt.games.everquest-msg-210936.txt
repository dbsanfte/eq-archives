At level 9 she can use Inner Fire to heal herself, so healing isn't a
problem.  Her melee abilities (defense) probably needs to be trained
so melee seems the way to go.  Druids use the DS and Heal method with
swarms of mobs; they can heal. Mages can PL a healing class using the
DS and Heal method using just single mobs; it's just that the PLee
does the healing. Once she is 16 she can group with a level 24.

I'd suggest fighting mobs that don't run at low HP's; she can't root
yet.  The undead in Befallen might be a good spot at her level and she
could get to 16 there. You could single pull using your Cancel Magic
spell; it aggros the mob but does no damage (so no KS) and her attack
should pull it off you quickly.
