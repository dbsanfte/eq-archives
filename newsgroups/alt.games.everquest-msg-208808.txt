Hi
I'm going to make the plunge and buy a laptop for playing EQ on and
was looking to real life expeirences.I was thinking about alienware or
dell untill i looked at resellers.com and noticed that they have pretty
bad marks overall.
The specs i'm looking at are:
P4 2.53 or higher
1 gig of mem
ati radeon 9000 or similar mobile chip(need opinions please)
40 gig fast hard drive
15 inch or bigger screen
Money is not much of an object,lets say under $3500.00 or so.
Will be plugged in mostly when on the road so battery life does
not really matter.I would like to play with all the eye candy turned
on as little lagg as possible except in the normal lag spots where
even my desktop has problems.

Thanks for any info
Richard
