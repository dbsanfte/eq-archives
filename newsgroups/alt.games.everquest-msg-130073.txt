    The combines on the picnics, cabbages, and pie are all fairly easy to do
(I've made all of them with sub-200 Baking), the components are fairly easy
to gather, and all three use one relatively easy-to-raise skill. The Steins
are used to skill up past 222 in Pottery, so plenty of them are out there
(even if the actual success rate is low when skilling). Pottery is also easy
to raise - I'm still averaging over a skill-up per stack of attempts
post-200 (made 214 last night).

    Poles are a pain in the arse to collect the ingredients, and getting
Fishing to 200 isn't exactly difficult. Most people doing this step get a
friend with 200 Fishing to do their combine. Anyone who can do cultural
smithing is capable of churning out sickles, but again the foraging is a
pain - it's easier for smiths to do the final combine for people that bring
them the components. We had one druid on our server doing all Idols for
auction for the longest time, but even with a "one iron oxide with payment"
policy she eventually got roadblocked on Iron Oxides. And she was offering
1000 pp EACH for them in the auction channel.

    Robes aren't auctioned much for another reason - anyone auctioning a
robe is usually assumed to be a 250 skill tailor. 250 skill tailors live in
a unique hell, tellbombed constantly for "just one combine, I have all the
stuff, I'll pay 50 pp and some grubs for your time!" The one known 250
Tailor on my server, Teyvan, recently started a thread on EQTraders to get
the other 250 Tailors to reveal who they are so he doesn't get so many
tells. When someone wants less business, you know there's a problem. Since I
have the scissors from Shei, I've started making robes (first one last
night!) for the guild. When you have both a bard playing mana song for you
and a level 60 necromancer in Arch Lich form dumping mana into you so you
can Imbue more emeralds for them, it stops being a neat sideline and starts
becoming an occupation. I can't imagine how bad it'll become once my skill
starts moving up (at 160 now, 184 effective with the Shears).
