Ran across an interesting idea in another newsgroup. The current weird
events in the Karanas are part of an Uber plotline (this is generally
accepted). The poster had an interesting alternative theory to the
opening of the plane of disease (although it could lead to that in
time).

World famine as the farmers of the Karanas watch their crops wither
and die or get eaten by swarms of insects. The Karanas *are* supposed
to be the breadbasket of the EQ world...

Thoughts?
