I don't know many people who use HB as a heal.

Using groups heals in battle situations . . . well I never do it except against
dragons that AE.  It becomes EXTREMELY effective at higher level encounters,
such as the guardians in Temple of Veeshan and say Trakanon, where the Level 57
AE heal - cure poison spell is phenomenally effective.

The differential in HP between tanks and casters just gets too great.

I would never ever EVER use a right-click Word of Healing during a battle. 
That horrendous cast time will get your enchanter killed even if he IS in
healing range.
