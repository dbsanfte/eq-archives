Plus, I have often heard about clerics complaining that in their 20s,
they've actually had a harder time getting a group than druids and
shamans because druids and shamans can still heal comparably close to
clerics but they can also SOW/regen/DOT/DS, etc.  Of course, after
level 34 when Clerics get Superior Healing it's a whole different ball
game.  

Clerics don't get any of the nice spells druids/shamans get (SOW,
invisibility, except to undead, regen, etc.) but they make up for it
by having the best healing power in the game.  It would really be
unfair to Clerics to have Druids/Shaman be able to get Superior
Healing at 39, for example, instead of level 51.
