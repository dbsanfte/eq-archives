Did you happen to look at your lag meter?  There's a pretty good chance you
just got hit with a lag spike.  In other words, you just about got
disconnected, and when your system started talking to the game server
again, it updated the elf's current position and moved him (from your point
of view.  From his point of view, and to the server, he never stopped
moving.)
