An old friend of mine liked to use "personal victory conditions" in
every game he played.  While I don't do that in all games, I do it
often and it makes for a lot more enjoyment.  For example, in the most
entertaining game of Kingmaker I ever played I started out with the
intent to kill all of the royal heirs (kings are an unnecessary evil,
make no truce with kings!), over time I won all but one of the other
players over to my "crusade", and when we obliterated the last guy's
forces (he had Beaufort) we declared a republic.  I bring this up
because I have very nearly zero interest in what are commonly viewed
as the "victory conditions" for EQ (not that very many are honest
enough to ackownledge them for what they are).  I do have a lot of
fun playing tho, and I find the damage done to the under-50 game plus
what amounts to a refusal to consider class balance under-50 really
annoying.
