}BIG Problem with my computer.

Probably not, actually.

}1. My lag bar starts racing at a crazy speed and the last number jumps above
}2500 and all the way up to 6500 sometimes. The rest of the numbers stay
}steady, 215 ping or so and 0% on both the middle sides.
}2. EVERYTHING I do is delayed by anywhere from 5 seconds to a minute or more
}(when it gets that bad, I normally get too frustrated and leave, so it could
}get delayed even higher). This includes casting spells (click gem 20 seconds
}later, "You begin casting X" and from there), group says, regular says,
}tells, where I am currently (I'll move away from a mob and it will still be
}hitting me as if I haven't moved yet), etc.
}3. I DO NOT get video lag, slow mouse movement, anything. And everyone else
}in the game appears to be moving normally. I see all tells as they are sent
}(from my own best judgment that is) and attack messages as I see someone
}attacking, etc. The rest of the game (what is left at least) appears to work
}just fine.

This sounds like one of the standard species of 'lag' that I have seen.  
Doesn't happen that often for me, but it happens.  What's really fun is 
when my rogue is successfully beating the heck out of an invisible mob 
that the chanter can see died a couple minutes ago... so I pull the rogue 
back around the corner with the rest of the melees and watch the whole 
melee contingent continue to flail its arms in the air. :)

}7. Called EQ Tech Support and they said it sounded like a connection
}problem. Called my ISP and they can detect nothing wrong from their end, all
}the way up the chain of servers (researched by some higher level tech
}support people and everything)

And it probably is a connection problem.  I've seen it happen when I'm 
twoboxing on identical systems, I get that kind of lag on one system, and 
no lag or some other variant of lag on the other system. 

If it's really really bad and all the time, all you can really do is 
switch ISPs.  It's possible your current ISP could make it a bit less 
frequent if you feel like spending months browbeating them into it, but 
that's probably not worth the effort.

'Nothing wrong' is an interesting assertion.  To some ISPs, having it 
clear on all the ports that 'normal' people use for web access is 'nothing 
wrong'.  And it may not be at the particular ISP, but something that 
regularly gets snafoued in the way data gets all the way from California 
to you.

Other than that, it sounds like you're doing all the right stuff.
