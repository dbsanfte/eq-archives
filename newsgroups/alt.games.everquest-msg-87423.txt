You could try doing something unusual and odd just for the laugh. It will
keep things interesting and help promote a fun play atmosphere over getting
bogged down in the "max XP power levelling drudge" rut.

If I had 3 freinds joining the game I would tell them to be all
beastmasters - it would be a riot to have pet's going off all over place and
doing those stupid pet things we all grow to love or hate, but gaurunteed to
produce laughs all round regardless. It will also turn heads wherever you
go.

Remember to ask your friends what type of experience they are after - fun
and beers or power gaming. You may well discover something very odd and
definately not "optimum" will fullfill your needs perfectly.
