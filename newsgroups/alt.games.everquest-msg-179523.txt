GOOD FUCKING GOD! Is that all you can come up with? If you don't have
a rebuttal, chant "CITE! CITE! CITE" like a fucking retarded parrot.

YES, he's responsible. Why am *I* being bashed for not citing when he
did the EXACT SAME FUCKING THING! Why isn't anyone chanting for HIM to
cite? FUCKING HYPOCRITES! If you can't keep the same standards, THEN
SHUT THE FUCK UP! As soon as HE cites where he's getting the
information that the price rate increased their profit margin by such
a huge percentage, I'll dig up information. As for now, I see no need
to dig up info when the person who made the original claim isn't
willing or even being CALLED to do so. Turning around now and doing it
will be pointless, as it'd only be done to spite me.

I notice the only ones chanting for *ME* to cite are the jackass who
like to jump on me every chance they get. Get over yourselves.
