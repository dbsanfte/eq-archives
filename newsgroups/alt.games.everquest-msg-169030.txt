Uhh... From what I hear not only is mischief a MAJOR PAIN IN THE ASS to get
to, but a MAJOR PAIN IN THE ASS to attempt. There is a reason why that one
aint in rotation....it aint worth it.

PoG is on Tunare, so most folks don't like to rock the boat, but if yer

IMO, you'd get pwnd with only 6-12 in almost any old-world plane.
