Sorry Dane, but that's BS.  And if you've been working in the
field for 25+ years, then you have no excuse for not knowing it.
Since when do the developers make these sorts of decisions on
products that produce millions of dollars of annual operating
profit?  Surely you don't imagine that SOE relies on EQ content
designers, coders, and database programmers to tell their managers
how to do their jobs?  If the developers are relying on volunteers
to do their basic reliability testing, then they are doing so at
the direction of their management.  And taking direction from their
their managers is fundamental to doing their jobs.
