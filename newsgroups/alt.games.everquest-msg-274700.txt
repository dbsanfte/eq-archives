Quick question... Why were you calling someone a pussy, anyway? What
did they do to make you call them a coward?  Did you challenge them to
a duel and have them refuse, like most of us players who have better
things to do with our time?  This game is rated Teen... 13+... That
means that there are high schoolers playing this.... Would you get
away with saying Pussy in high school, regardless of the context? 
From your comments thusfar, I have determined that you must live in a
bomb shelter, or perhaps some remote Alaskan wilderness... Because if
you were a normal member of society, who actually had some sort of
contact with his fellow human beings, then A: You would be mature
enough to not be a !@$%ing troll and CALL people pussies, in game or
in real life... I mean come on, thats just rude... grow up.  B: You
know, like the other 99% of the population, that the word Pussy is
considered inapropriate language by many people, and would not be
appropriate for an ONLINE, MULTIPLAYER game that is rated Teen and has
Terms of Service that, by the way, YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO UNDERSTAND
BEFORE YOU PLAY.  and C: You would actually have a LIFE and perhaps
FRIENDS, which, given how devistated you are from being away from
World of Warcraft for THREE DAYS, you obviously do not.  I mean, come
on, it is a fun game, but it shouldn't be your sole reason for living.
 Finally, I would like to thank the moderators for removing this troll
from the game for at least 3 days, because I for one am tired of being
insulted because I don't want to duel some random stranger who is 3
levels above me, or I want to come out ahead (as opposed to in the
red), from selling the items I craft, or I don't want to share the tin
vein that I spent fifteen minutes fighting my way to.  Thank you, and
I hope he uses the word again soon, so we can be rid of him again.
