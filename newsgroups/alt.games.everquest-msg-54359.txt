A proper server split should allow it, yes. It's only when you pay for a
move that they move your character naked.
I logged onto AB last night to see how much better my connection was and was
pretty impressed, ping or 60 - 90 (normally 180 - 250 on Bristlebane) so I
may go with that move when it comes up, not that the higher ping has ever
caused me problems (Packet Loss and disconnects are a different matter)
