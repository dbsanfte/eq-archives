I'm trying to order the new expansion. since they changed the log on stuff, it opens the browser and
asks fro the accvount number to bind my acount with the game. the last expansion i got was download
and didnt have a number with it. i have registered the ones i bought in the store, when i got them.
i was thinking that these would help.
