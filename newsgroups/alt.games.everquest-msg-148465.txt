}    In general: if a spell does multiple things, it has multiple spell
}checks (or did previously - this could have changed in the new resist
}system). So a DoT with an initial DD component, or a debuff effect, would be
}more resisted than a DoT without these things assuming they're both of the
}same resist type and both as difficult to resist (no modifiers). Spells with
}multiple checks also are either completely resisted, or land for full
}because if one component is resisted the spell fails. The cleric DD-stuns
}are an example of this - the DD portion never lands for partial damage, it's
}all-or-nothing.

So... if it has resist check for a second component, do you know of a way 
one could find out what resist it checks against?  I'm expecting the 
answer, "use your common sense - like, Breath of Ro is obviously fire and 
magic", but I find that answer unsatisfactory, since Verant so often 
doesn't use theirs.  Can the spdat be parsed for that?
