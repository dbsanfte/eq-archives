There's another article about EQ in today's "Herald Sun", Melbourne,
Australia, called "Killer Internet game" that mostly bashes the game
talking about people getting addicted to it and spending up to days at
a time playing.  It also mentions Shawn Woolley, the young man who
played EQ and committed suicide whose mom is suing Verant, as well as
the guy who was charged with beating his son to death because the kid
was crying and interrupting his game.  Here's what the article says in
the first two paragraphs alone:

====================

Evercrack is what they are calling it, an online computer game being
blamed for divorce, domestic violence, even the odd death.

Its real name is EverQuest, an MMORPG or massively multiplayer online
role-playing game, that has more than half a million players across
the globe hooked, line and sinker.
