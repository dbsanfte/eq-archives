True Paul...but even if I think they are overreacting I tend to give them
the benefit of the doubt because, just like in most other things, people
place different importance on the same things and it's really not my place
to judge them for it.  I could not care less if someone called me a cracker
(I'm from Florida...groan) or just about any kind of slur either in a joking
or a heated manner...friend or not...but I wouldn't think about using them
on another person (well maybe in closed quarters and if I really knew them)
because I respect the impact they have.  It's just not my place to tell
someone they shouldn't get upset...they have their reasons and they are just
as valid to them as mine are to me.  Of course, like Bizbee, I tend to use
words like a sledgehammer when I intend to do it.
