The spiders that can see invis and cast root make the FV run pretty
tough.  It makes me wonder if Verant wanted to nerf the good races a
bit.  If there's a reliable way through, I haven't found it yet, though
taking the tunnel and hugging the wall helps.  When during my second
corpse recovery I saw a level 43 warrior at the zone begging for help
getting through, I decided I'd never go back to FV.  

I get a port to Dreadlands when I need to go.  That is a longer run
through a higher level area, but I've had better luck because the
concentration of mobs is not as high.  Make sure you have
SoW/invis/levitate and good maps.  You might not want to try Dreadlands
because of the possible difficulties with corpse recovery, but if you
have high level friends who can help it can be a good option.  

Some general advice I've heard for runs through high level areas like
this: if one person gets attacked or goes down, get a loc but make sure
everyone else keeps running.  It's easier to do a corpse recovery for
one or two than a whole group.
