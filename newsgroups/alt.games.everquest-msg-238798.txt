Here's a little tip for you. Losses don't mean shit, its just for display.

I hate people that sit around waiting for the 'perfect' group. If I did that
I'd never get any adventuring done.

Hell I have had some really good adventures with some crazy group make ups.
Did one with all pet casters! Did one with a paladin as the healer! Won
both.
Had plenty of rangers tank, and even monks tank.

Sure I've lost some to but they were always fun.

Sitting around waiting for a cleric AND a plate tank AND a bard or chanter
wastes time.

What really pisses me off is the people that poo poo joining my group
because I don't have the 'right' classes or enough people yet to make
joining worth their while. Glad everyone doesn't do that otherwise
there would only be a handful of adventures done a day.

The other ones that piss me off are the ones that go LD if the group
isn't quite right or is going poorly. Have the balls to at least admit that
you
are bailing. This makes it rough on the people that go LD legitimately and
really are coming back.
