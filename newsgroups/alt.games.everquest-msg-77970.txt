I have a lv 35 High elf Pally and noticed something that I cannot explain.
When looking at my skill levels, my offense and defense seem to be capped 5
below all my other fighting skills. Right now I have a skill of 180 in
things like 2hs, abjuration etc, but my offense and defense are only at 175
max, what gives?

Thanks for any insight )
