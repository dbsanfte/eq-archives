I did my stint as a guide. I don't pretend to know exactly what they
were doing all the time, but I don't instantly assume that means
they're sitting on their thumbs and getting paid for it. Hell, if not
for the report notes going into the guide channel, I wouldn't have
known what most of the other guides were doing, or even that they were
online (unless I did a /who all gm).

The other factor here is that, while an anon guide can't be seen by
players on a /who check but can be seen by other guides, an anon GM
can't even be seen by guides with a /who check.
