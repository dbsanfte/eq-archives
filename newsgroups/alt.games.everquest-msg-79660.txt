You obviously have no clue about the laws of probability.

You say "More rolls - more successes," well guess what: more rolls also
equals more failures!!

Let's play with a 25% success rate.  25% of 100 is 25 succeses and 75
failures, 25% of 200 is 50 successes with 150 failures.

If you do twice the damage in those 25 swings as you do in the 50 swings,
you end up doing, say it with me, the same amount of damage!

Sorry for jumping in, just wanted to provide another voice of sanity.
