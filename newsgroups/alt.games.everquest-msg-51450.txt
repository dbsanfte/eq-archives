I think they probably have the same CS as other games. When I quit UO
shortly after it came out, I had to call Texas with a non-800 number
and sit on hold for over 20 minutes accumulating long distance charges
just to speak to a CS person. This must be why they didn't offer a
simple menu in the log-on to quit at the time. A real pain-in-the-ass
to quit UO in the early days.
