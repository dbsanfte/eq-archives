Don't give me the tired crap about expecting other players to play the
game the way I prefer, Biz. That's not at all what I'm saying. Why have
other people in the game at all, if not for cooperative play? Chat? If I
wanted to chat, I would be on IRC and not bending over for a monthly fee
and regular expansions. If it's just for buffs, they could plug an NPC
in for that purpose. Soul binders anyone?

What am I missing there? How is FV or other specialty servers tweaked
for soloing? The difference is not obvious. Single character creation
limit? TLC? Fewer NODROP items? None of that seems necessarily conducive
to soloing. Well, I guess the free-for-all Zek server (one of them is
solo-based, right?) might be one. That's really the only situation where
I can see a reason for a solo-only server. Take away the PvP though, and
like I said, you may as well be on any server. 

I can certainly see someone entertaining the idea. I just don't think
it's viable for what *I* thought were somewhat obvious reasons. What's
the gain?
