I've always used what's generally known on Usenet as 'selective
cut-and-paste', and I've ALWAYS been attacked for it.  It's like the
'unwritten rule' about never criticizing someone's spelling.  I think that's
bunk, too.  If someone can't be bothered to present their post at least
moderately well then they obviously don't consider it that important.

It's as though some people believe that any of their message previous to my
reply has somehow disappeared, never to be seen again, and that I'm somehow
distorting their words by not quoting them in their entireity.  When in
fact, not only can the threads remain accessible far longer than any
reasonable person would need, but also thanks to the monstrosity that is
Google any poster is liable to have a regretted-but-thought-forgotten post
from years ago thrown in their face at any time.

That's not to say I'm going to stop doing it, though - I think it's the best
compromise between no-one having a clue what you're talking about and
everyone getting bored stupid before they actually get to your bit.
