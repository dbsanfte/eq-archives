I was playing with the boat gnomes and ended up in OOT. I realised the
cyclops were lt blue and decided to try fighting one, as I had never really
explored this zone. Root rot took ages! They had a heap of hitpoints, and
the one i killed dropped 5 plat which is ok, but not impressive considering
how much harder they are than hill giants. Does anyone still hunt these
mobs? I imagine they would make a good chanter pet if there's anything else
about to fight?
