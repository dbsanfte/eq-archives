   I hate doodspeak.  I hate when people type "plz" instead of
"please".  I hate "thx", "kk" and "?" (if you have a question, ask the
whole question!)  Saying PoT or KEI is fine by me though.. those are
abbreviations that do make sense.

   But in the heat of a battle, refusing to heal someone because they
didn't ask in the correct manner for you to do freaking job?  No Frank,
you're not alone in feeling this way.
