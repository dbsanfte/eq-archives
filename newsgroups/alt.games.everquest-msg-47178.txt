Now that they see that someone actually might be interested, they most
likely will publish one because they want to rip every penny they can from
the game. :)
Sadly, it will probably be just somewhat forcefully extended rips in midi
quality. :/

I, myself, turned all sounds of EQ off after 2 months of playing. I think
the whole sound world is irritating. Oh, except for the ocean music that
plays (iirc) between BBM and FP :).
Am i wrong if i claim that it has certain similarities with Ultima 9
buccaneers den music?-)

PS. I think Hammerfall (Renegy, Dreamland, Dragonfire) and Manowar (Black
wind, fire and steel) fit perfectly on the background when in a heavy group,
struggling to keep in the phase of the mad puller. =)
