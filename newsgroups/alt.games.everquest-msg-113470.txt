Theres a big difference.

Using 'u' and '4' is very different to critisising somebodies spelling and
grammer.

If you check my previous posts, you will notice I hardly ever use shortened
letters anyway, I was just disagreeing with the point that using them is
lazy and stupid.

I do use them at times, but i went to college, im a computer programmer, my
spelling isn't bad (nothing posted here is ever spell checked).

I dont come here to get judged by some stuck up jerk in a condescending tone
who thinks he is better than me by using "big" words

Judge me on what I write and not on my writing skills, or I will not so
politely tell you where to shove it.
