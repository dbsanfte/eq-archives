I played on Bertoxx until they started sorting servers alphabeticallty
by default and we got insanely bottom heavy. If I were high level
there, it would have been nice to have a market for lower-level stuff
I wanted to sell. As it was, I was level 25ish, fighting for spawns
with all of the other mid-20s chars for spawns in South Karana and
Upper Guk. (This was pre-Kunark.)

I was only too happy to leave for Torvonnilous when my friends went.
That's where I play the lion's share of my time. I also occasionally
play on Test, although not as much as I might like.
