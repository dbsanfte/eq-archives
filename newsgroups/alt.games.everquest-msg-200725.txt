: I still disagree with the basic premise of nerfing KEI to slow levelling.

I don't think that KEI should be "nerfed", rather the work-around for group
buffs should be fixed.  They can keep people that are too low to group from
getting exp, they should be able to keep the buffs from sticking.  They can
keep targetred buffs from sticking, it should be possible for the group
buffs to be effectively blocked, also (maybe they will need to block the
spell if anyone in the group is too low).

: With or without KEI if you really really want to get to level 50 really
: really fast you can.

With the right friends and no life, I agree.

: Some can do it in just days.
:
: I think so what !. If you want KEI get it. If you don't don't.
: If you want to stop and smell the roses as you level then that's fine.
: If you want to level up quick. Do So.

But don't sit in the EXP zones with your level 65 dr00d pulling the zone
just so you can be PLd.  Remember there are others that want to play, too.


:
: But having group A inflict group A's playstyle and ideology onto group B
is
: really really silly.

This is life.  Group A always dictates to Group B, whether playstyle or
morality, there is always someone telling others how it should be and how it
must be.  Anything else is anarchy.  You think that SOE is not dictating
playstyle to some extent?  Why else can you not just autolevel to any level
you want?


: Nerfing of a spell an item a playstyle a ZEM whatever will not change the
: fact a player that wants to get to level X fast will do so.
:

Agreed.  But, again, do not impact my play with your impatience.  I don;t
want you to dictate to me how I should play or where I can group if you
decide to PL through.  Remember, this is not golf.  You cannot just declare
you are "playing through" a slow group.
