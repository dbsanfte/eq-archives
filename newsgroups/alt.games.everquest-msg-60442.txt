  Yeah, all roleplayers kiss GM ass and speak in Middle English and that's
the only way to get recognized during a GM event... give me a break.

  Don't be an asshole to someone just because you enjoy little else about EQ
than the numbers.  If that's how you get your kicks, fine, but don't piss on
someone because they, god forbid, try to roleplay and enjoy themselves in a
way which is not consistent with YOUR playstyle.

  Unless someone is not directly negatively impacting your gameplay there's
no reason to be so intolerant and insulting.
