    *cough* *sputter* Yeah, suuuuure he didn't. The effect is in the spdat,
so they knew (if they did any digging, and believe me when I say top guilds
all parse the spdat) what the effect would be. FoH also has a history, if
you will, of getting information from their friends amongst the Dev team.
The best story there was when Furor told the people in Legion of Steel all
the stats of the Avatar of War's drops over AIM, before the AoW had been
killed by anybody.

    In general, it looks like the pattern for FoH loot awards is like this:
when the "big boss" is killed, Furor gets what he wants off it. Then, for
all the other non-"big boss" kills, loot is given to those for whom it would
make the biggest difference. So he isn't a loot whore like the leaders of
some guilds can be, but he makes sure he gets the stuff with the most
"prestige" attached to them.

    I see one of these coming into the world every X days on a server where
Vex Thal has been entered, where X is the respawn on the final boss.
Clearing the zone doesn't seem difficult given how quickly two top guilds
did it, and I bet she always drops the needed quest item (like Velious kings
and Seru always dropping heads).
