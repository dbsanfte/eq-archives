Some of the quests in PoP for the level-2 focus items require you to own 
several expansions (the spell haste 2 belt requires forages from old world, 
kunark, velious and luclin).  So there certainly is a precedent for cross-
expansion quests already in the game.

I think that some progressive quests would be fun and interesting.  Heck, 
make the end result an upgrade to the epic, but make it attainable with 
help from a mid-sized guild and it'd be great for most of the players out 
there.
