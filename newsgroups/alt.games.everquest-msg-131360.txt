Guilds are funny.  What I see a lot of are point based bidding systems,
where points are earned by attending raids.  I suppose if your guild
gets on a POG binge then the abstainers could fall behind without
such a formal "loss of seniority" plan.

Personally, I'm annoyed even by a points system, any guild more formal
than that would see my /guildremove in very short order indeed
