Sure.  Having your cat bring home live, unharmed rabbits can be quite
profitable...and tasty.
During dinner, throw some of the catch to the cat, leaving the dog chained
up just out of reach.  If he is smart enough to watch and learn, he'll be
bringing home dinner too.
Keeps the food bills down that way (however, if either of them starts
bringing home packaged food...then time for the punishment...I don't think
that story would hold up well in court without good proof, and proof you
didn't train them either).
