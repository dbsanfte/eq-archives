>>> Friends, please tell me why did Basher Smag aggro me?  Also, if I did
not have any friends online, how could I have extracated myself from this
mess? <<<

The newbie guards are usually really high level, and Trolls don't like
Halflings (except for dinner). That's more than likely why you were agroed.

If you have no friends online, then try these options:

1) Check to see if any necros of sufficient level are on. I know if I wasn't
busy, and i was asked nicely, I wouldn't have a problem doing it.

2) Find a newbie troll, ask if he'll drag your corpse for you, then
donate/buff him for his trouble.
