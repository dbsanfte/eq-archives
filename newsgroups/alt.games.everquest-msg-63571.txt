  A warrior/shaman hyrbid that wears a "lesser" armor than both?  Hm.  I
don't know, but putting a "melee" type class in leather armor seems like a
recipe for disaster, but we'll see what the execution is like.  Maybe Luclin
will introduce some really nice leather class armor, or some class specific
beastlord armor with roughly chain class AC.

  Tickets to the moon?  Hrm.
