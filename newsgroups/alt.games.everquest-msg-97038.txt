And the reason why on every character below 6 I always stayed near
"home." That is what the change is for. A level 5 or even 4 CAN go
into blackburrow and get xp, is he going to when he could lose his
corpse before he can get to it? No, sometimes not. Instead he'd do
like I always did, get to level 6 on stuff right outside qeynos and on
the firebeetles and the bone chip quest with lashun novashire as well
as the paladin guild bone chip quest (great xp for 6 bonechips)

Is he now going to go to blackburrow and kill gnolls? Yes. 
That is what the change is for.

But, again, I don't think that most newbies were getting very far from
home because of the penalty (having to run to their corpse) Its just
much harder to orchestrate a CR as a newbie. Think of a new server and
newbies in Paineel, how many do you think might fall into the hole
completely losing a corpse when no one is high enough level to fix it?
I'd guess at least a few if paineel saw much traffic. Now they pop up
before level 10 with their gear and probably learn an important
lesson, preventing it from happening later.

I disagree. Its not a mistake since it seeks to prevent non
exploratory behavior. Halflings can now run into runneye and try to
tackle those first lower goblins pre level 11 because they don't have
the sense of loss while before the halflings stayed safely tucked away
in misty until it greened out, basically doing the equivilent of
sucking on the zone teat.

People were usually not taking the risk, to have this remove that
risk.
