I think you miss the point of eq here. These different classes are
available to build viable groups around them. So up to a certain degree
some classes are interchangeable. But even then they are that much
distinct that you have to work with different tactics. Sure you could
get rid of everything besides warrior, cleric, enchanter and lets say
wizard. You have everything covered then. But EQ isn't about the single
way to solve situations. Foremost it's a fantasy world where a lot of
different classes bring alot of options to the table.
When SOE invented the berserkers I really wondered what role they should
play. Same with beastlords. And granted I know of a few beastlords that
are aggravated about the GoD expansion. Because they feel GoD only
caters to the specialists. And this clearly isn't a role the beastlords
are.

Just try to think out of the box. I know it's hard to build groups. But
if you stick to it you'll find sometimes people who are willing to go
way beyond the usual exp/loot whatever grind. These are the kind of
people that happily choose a druid or a monk in their group just because
they know you can and will play both.

Oh and one last thing. If you're the type of player to beat the game.
Stick to leveling until you're old enough to apply to a raid guild.
Druids and monks are needed on raids.
