Well, Ghoulbanes have come down a lot, but not *that* much. <g> However,
if you can stick it out until you save up four or five hundred plat,
that will be your optimum weapon for a long time to come.
  However, in the meanwhile, there are many other options which would be
magical upgrades for a lot less money. If you go to the auction zones
and listen, you *might* find a vellium 1HS weapon for sale. They go
cheap. Five or ten plat max, are magic, and will have better stats than
your fine steel.
  If you are still hanging out in Dwarfland, it's kind of a long trip,
but if you travel to the Karanas and start auctioning to buy, you can
get a gnoll hide lariat (1HS, also magic with a proc) very cheap as
well. (Same price range.)
  Somewhat closer would be to go to Lavastorm (nice zone at your level,
by the way.) and auction in/near Najena. Tentacle whips drop there,
approx the same value/cost as a gnoll hide lariat, only with a different
proc.
  There's tons more, I'm sure, but those are the first to come to mind
with only one cup of coffee.
