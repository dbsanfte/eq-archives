That sounds familiar being saved in the last second, i have trained in
using bandages but never used it in the field.

The game is great i'm totally hooked, last night when i disconnected
i had been online for 23 hours+, but i have a total of 15 guys to
play, the 5 residing on the povar server i have not played so far,
to bad you can only have eight on one server, i play on luclin and now
i'm starting to recognise the people and have some "friends"

Finding armour can be hard, at least for a low cost, some orc raiders
in North ro can have some shields and sometimes armour.

When i started my iksar shaman and hunted in Field of bone i managed
to get a rather nice loot, after about 45 mins i had 10gp 100+sp and
200+cp, no fortune but rather nice for a newbie area
