I used to do this... but often with a new member in the group or the fact
that I cast 3 buffs on each tank drops my mana too low to get all of them in
one fell swoop....
I usualy dont buff myself and say to the group what the buffs names are and
please let me know when they drop.
I am a cleric also... and that symbol line sure does suck the mana down....
