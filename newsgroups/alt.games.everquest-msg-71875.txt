My husband still solos with his level 52 ranger from time to time, although he says
it's very gear dependent and without what he's got - some tolan's pieces,  a weapon
that procs a 625 pt. dd spell, items that raise his dex to somewhere in the 165
range unbuffed - he probably couldn't still do it.  But through the lower levels,
sure, you should be able to do it fairly easily. If nothing else you can fear kite
animals.
