I don't think anyone's system has performed up to par since Luclin.  Mine is
not quite as good as yours, but also no slouch:  Althlon XP 1700+ (about
1.4GHz), 512DDR, GF4 Ti 4200 and I get awful graphical lag in
Luclin/PoP/somewhat in LoY zones.  I have not come across anyone in-game or
on this newsgroup that claims to have 60+ fps in any of those expansion
zones, and I would be quite surprised if anyone did.  My system does perform
at that level in other, more modern games (Warcraft 3, Neverwinter Nights,
Jedi Knight 2, etc.).  Does yours?  If so, in short, I'd say your problem is
likely only with Everquest.  Mine certainly is :-)

P.S. You can check PCPitstop.com, they also have a battery of benchmark
tests.
