I don't remember if I hinted this or not...

But I've already selected my Surname... and "Overcast" ain't it :)

Of course I did say once or twice that I won't actually issue the /surname
command until I am a Sorcerer... though I have been thinking that I might
issue it when my class name changes in 8 levels... since I will then
consider myself to be "high level."
