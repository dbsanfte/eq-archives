Is he on bard faction? I thought he was beta neutral. He's never aggroed on
me. But then, I didn't move West until I hunted Gargoyles in OOT for a few
levels, and that fixed my bard faction very nicely. I'll ask a few other
necros. I have a gnecro who is a faction maven- she wants to be loved by
everyone at once- and she's slowly getting there. She's also a loon, but
we'll not go there. She would know what her base faction was with him.
