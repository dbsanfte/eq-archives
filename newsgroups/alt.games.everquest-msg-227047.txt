That's for sure! The upside to this is that I can easily act as MH for a
group when a Cleric isn't around. I don't really like doing this (if I
wanted to play MH I would have rolled a Cleric, thank you). But it does open
up more playing possibilties if I can get a group that will go with this
lineup.

Yeah that's what I wind up doing (adapting) and in the group that inspired
this message, it could be argued that I helped bring them to victory in 30
minutes. There wasn't much patch healing to do because, frankly, there
wasn't much healing to do. The more I think about this particular encounter,
the more I'm thinking the mission was just too easy for this particular
group. This is why I'm hoping LDoN gets harder sometime soon, because I have
a lot of trouble convincing people to try High Difficulty ...

Yep, my experience exactly.

Agreed, although I suspect the net effect is that we finished the adventure
in 30 minutes instead of 32.

Remember the analysis you wrote up on efficiency of DoTs? When the killing
is going this fast, a DoT barely has time to get its first tick off before
the mob dies. Nukes make more sense, but hey, if the mana is there ...

Well that's my conclusion, too, but unless I'm with our core team I can't
get much interest in High difficulty. I wonder what percentage of LDoNer's
go for High? (See separate post on this topic).

You may have noticed that this is similar to what Oro and I have been doing.
He tries to land his Tash just as my Slow is flying through the air. If
you've got the mana, wouldn't hurt to have your Malosi coming at the same
time.

Yes and usually that's easy to figure out. I swear, this one LDoN experience
that inspired this message was one of those where it just didn't matter what
I did, it had almost no appreciable effect. The adventure was just too easy
for our group. We were probably on the south cusp of a mob border and it was
mostly a guild I was with (which means not only that they were working well
together, not unlike our core team, but also probably well equipped if not
overly twinked).

Yes, it's been my experience that I can easily function as MH. The usual
response from uninformed tanks, of course, is "No, we need a real healer". I
know, separate problem. ;-)
