The dammage list is a computer memory stack . The stack is not nearly large
enough to handle every single combat dammage number untill resolution of the
combat for anything but low level mobs.This results in a great deal of the
dammage being relegated to no single individual or group at the point of the
mobs death. This results in groups who do the most amount of dammage that is
still contained in the stack gaining the exps and looting rights . This
results in the group with the wizzies and rogues who backstab and do large
numbers right at death gaining the exps .
