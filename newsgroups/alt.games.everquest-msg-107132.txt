I saw an auction message from this character in EC on vazelle, could swear I
actually saw him run by, and then got the yells for help message in
Netherbian Lair yesterday, but no such person on track.

: A few days ago, I was in the Oasis, waiting for the barge at the docks,
when

: Okay, at first I was thinking, who the blazes could that be?  I -know- you
: can't pick that for a name...  Must be a glitch... Oh well...  Then, a
group

chat
: channel just for Kedge so that we could work together... The people
already
: there were very cool, showing us the ropes to handle pulls in that
: dungeon...  (very underpopulated dungeon...  and -great- XP).  Anyway, we
: get down to the second floor, and start pulling Mermaids....  I sit back
in
: the corner and heal as necessary, and all of a sudden, I hear:
:
: 8^| yells for help (blah,blah)...

: Huh??  Okay, there are only 10 people in the entire zone.  I asked people
if
: they heard that, but most said no (one person in my group said yeah)..
: Could have gotten lost in battle spam, or whatever...

: Has anyone else received this message?  Or is this a case of another GM
: playing around?  ( Like the one time in EC where I kept getting the
message
: "You are out of food", then followed by "You have plenty of food.
~burp~"
: Heh... :)
