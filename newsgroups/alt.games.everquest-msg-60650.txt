A problem with EQ is that the looting codes are too restrictive. I bought a
magic sword before i ever looted one at 22th level. Now tell me, why would a
NON-TWINK ever go to the Unrest zone to fight without a magic weapon? It is
impossible to hit ghouls without magic. So you have to be a twink or atleast
have invested in a magic weapon from before. (Where do u buy magic weapons..
EC tunnel mostly from other PC characters). Now tell me, when was the last
time you saw someone trying to sell "Gladiator" magic sword? (a real bad
magic weapon)? Never. They sell only mostly mid-high end magic items.
Verant should have made this weapon and other minor magical items available
for lower level characters, who where perhaps in need of this weapon to hunt
magical creatures, instead they are placed roughly at midlevelers. Totally
wrong place to put this kind of loot. Totally useless for midlevelers
aswell.
