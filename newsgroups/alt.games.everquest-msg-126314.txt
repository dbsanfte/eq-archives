My recollection is similar: before the PNP, Verant hadn't said anything
official about it, so it was one of those things that varied among the
servers.  That is, at least on some servers, there was a general
understanding among the players whether Highpass was FFA or not, and the GM
on that server would follow that.  

Then, one day, the MOTD said that there are no FFA zones anywhere.  I never
did hear what prompted that.  Anyone know what happened?  At least on The
Nameless, FFA was working out fine, and most people were happy with it.

There used to be quite a few areas in which the rules on particular servers
might differ.  At one time on some server (not mine...it was one some
friends played on.  I'm not sure which one), the GMs even were enforcing the
unofficial Planes calendar.  4 days a week it was pure PNP.  The other 3, if
you were there but not on the calendar, and some guild that was on the
calendar complained, you got kicked out.  My recollection is that they had
much less bitching about Planes access on that server than we did on The
Nameless.

I think Verant should have encouraged these kinds of differences, but made
the GMs document them, and them publish them on the Verant website, so
people could pick a server whose rules they liked.
