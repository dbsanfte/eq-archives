 Actually you can increase goblin faction (MountainDeathClan). I'm not
sure that's all Kunark goblins as I seem to recall seeing them on two
factions. Anyway, killing Sarnaks increases that. At least the Sarnaks
in Chardok. It's been awhile since I've killed a sarnak elsewhere so I
don't know if others give the faction or not.

 Just an FYI although I agree. Nobody would waste time trying to
increase this faction is it is fairly worthless. But there's a
possibility they could if they were really bored for a few weeks.
