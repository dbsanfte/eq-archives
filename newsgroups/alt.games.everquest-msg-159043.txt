This whole thread has had big holes shot into it by whatever
newsreader/newsfeed problem caused the original "misfiling",
so I'm not surprised I didn't see that either.  Still haven't,
in fact.  :-)

Another victim of the bit-bucket, unfortunately.

Usually when my threads get messed up one or more messages
end up with totally blank subject/author tags in the thread
index, making it pretty obvious, but it was sneakier this time.
It was a digital conspiracy, I tell you.


>You're still wrong, however. :-D

Nuh uh!!
