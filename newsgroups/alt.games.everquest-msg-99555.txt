Uhm...adding up all the /played time on my various characters, I think
I reached about 70 days without knowing where the druid portal is in
BB.  Even know, I've only seen it once, when my druid hit 19 and tried
out the port.  That two minute without SOW run can be a hell of a lot
more than two minutes if you have no idea where things are in BB, and
there are things in BB that will pulp a level 16 who gets lost.
