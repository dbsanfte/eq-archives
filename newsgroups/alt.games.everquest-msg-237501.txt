Poor Guard Cheslin!!!!  LOL

He is actually a part of some little newbie quest wherein you follow him on his
circuit around QH and keep him alive and he will drop 4 cards.  You pick them
up and then give them to... um....  I wanna say his Dad In Qeynos.  Dunno, I
always got bored with trying to do this one and never got all 4 cards before
allowing him to be eaten by a rat or a gnoll...  LOL

The two guards outside the cottage in QH are also fairly low level, but I
believe you will raise faction with the good guards if you kill them...  They
are for the Monk Newbie quest.  

Personally, my goal is Nash.  That bastage is going to pay for all the times he
has KS'd me.  LOL
