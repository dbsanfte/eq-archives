Nope, unless they changed something.  I was in Oasis when I hit 16, and went
to The Overthere because it was close.  Paid about 19pp, if I remember
right.  Unless you have a lot of extra money, I suggest going the "good"
route and spending a lot less in Firiona.  The extra 8 or so play back then
was a lot to me, but I was in a hurry.
