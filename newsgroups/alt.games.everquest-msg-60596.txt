Not true.
Most Euro guilds, especially established ones don't want to leave
their existing US servers for one very big reason:

They have a HUGE time zone advantage.

Everytime VI patches the servers, Euro guilds have about 6 to 8 hours
lead time on non-Euro guilds for contested spawns (such as Tormax,
Dain, ToVN, ST, etc...).

Euro guilds moving to the Euro servers aren't really buying much
(somewhat less latency and stabler connections).  They are however
losing that time zone advantage since everyone on that server will be
Euro time based.

Most never left.
