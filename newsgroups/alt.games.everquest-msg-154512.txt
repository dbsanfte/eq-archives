The 32M card should be fine for any of the bundled expansions
except maybe Luclin.  You can still use Luclin with it but the time
lag will most likely be frustrating in a lot of zones and you'll probably
give up on the moon expansion until you upgrade your video card to
64M or better and upgrade your RAM to 512M.

I still have a 32M video card in one machine but the 512M ram makes
up for a lot of it's shortcomings and I keep the graphic settings low.

Yes, absolutely. I ran original EQ only on my Celeron 850 with 128M
and 32M video card, and zoning times (time to exit one game zone and
enter the next one) were miserably slow due to low ram.

NOTE- and this is on a DSL high speed connection.  Simply not enough
ram to efficiently handle the game and data.

When I bought the trilogy expansions I immediately went to 256M ram
and that helped a lot, so much so (and Ram was at it's cheap stage again)
that I went right to 512M ram as soon as the Luclin (moon) expansion
hit the shelves.

> My amd 450 should also be good for the first chapter also?

Yes, fine for the original 3 (the Trilogy of EQ/Kunark/Velious) but I'm
not sure if Shadows of Luclin will like it.   :-)
Luclin minimum specs (off the box) are:
WinDOZE 98 or better
Pentium 2 400 or better
256M ram
16M 3d graphics card
450M disk space
and a 28.8 modem connection

Recommended specs are:
WinDOZE 98 or better
Pentium 3 or better (no speed listed, wierd)
512M ram
32M 3d graphics card
1.5G disk space
and 56K modem connection

I don't think I'd want to try Luclin without a high speed connection
because my link deaths and lost connections went WAY down once
I got the DSL service.   worth every penny!   :-)

I would recommend ONLY buying the very cheap basic EQ game
for about $10(US) or $16(Cdn) and try that out.
It still comes with 30 days free trial period (yes you must register a
credit card for payment services but it's not charged unitl after 30 days)
and will be the lowest cost/risk way for you to test drive the game unless
you have a buddy to let you use his.
(and account sharing violates the EULA so I wouldn't advise it)

If you don't really "love"the game after 30 days you are only out $10.

If you do love it and upgrade to all EQ expansions you'll still be happy
about the cheap $10 satisfaction insurance you invested in to try the
game with.

my opinion anyways.    :-)
