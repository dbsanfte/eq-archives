Texas may follow the Castle Doctine (allowing the use of deadly force in 
one's home against an intruder without a requirement to retreat if possible 
from a lethal confrontation), but I'm not aware of any general rule that 
authorizes the use of deadly force to protect property. Do you have a 
citation to support this unlikely assertion?
