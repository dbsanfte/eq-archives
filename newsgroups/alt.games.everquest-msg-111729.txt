    Positioning. If you're standing in the right place when you fight
they'll path cleanly into the tunnels, if not they clip the wall and it's
time to nuke or run to Dalnir. Yeah, that was an unpleasant lesson to learn.
I also had one incident where a giant started beating on me from somewhere
while I was camping apes. You can either zone it, or run out the front of
the cave and confront them there.

    Always good to know where that zone is. I had two incidents where
someone trained goblins into the tunnels as I was chasing down a runner.
Once, I had more than enough mana to take them down. Once, it was run to
Dalnir time.

    Some types of mobs should never be used in non-raid encounters in large
multiples. Shadow Knight-type mobs are a very good example. With the way
aggro works, one person is going to get lit up like a Christmas tree. I
zoned into Kurn's once just as I saw someone across the entry hall chase
something down the stairs. I ran halfway across the entry hall, saw three
quick "writhes in the grip of agony" messages followed by a "has died"
message, and started heading downstairs to do CR for the poor guy.

    It's tricky. It took me forever to get up there the one time I went,
even with everyone else scooting up like it was nothing.
