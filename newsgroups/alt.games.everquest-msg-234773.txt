I dont think you have any chance of convincing a court that a vendor has no
right to ban you when they stated up front that they would if you broke the
terms.  You knew the rules and agreed to them AND they were reasonable too.
Try as you might to find legal loopholes and exceptions, a contract freely
entered into and with reasonable limitations is binding.
