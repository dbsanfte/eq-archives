My 2 copper pieces. I do not consider any a "dick" for asking for a 
donation for any buff they may have. But they should remember what the 
term donation means. For me personally, and it may not be for everyone 
each person must decide for themselves, I just say that I accept 
donations and they are very much appreciated. I have always thought that 
"casting ------ for donations" should be stated "casting ------- for 
--" and they should put in a specific price.
Now as for PC, I have made 2 observations. 1) Those who boldly state 
"You have to share" are the ones that always say "Go away" when you ask 
them to share. 2) The polite person will find it a much longer task 
trying to level. I personally have done things in this zone that I have 
never, never done with any toon of mine on any server that I play on. I 
have felt bad about it later and even have brought in my main to PL some 
other toons afterwards. But PC is not PC (Politically Correct).

Just a few thoughts
