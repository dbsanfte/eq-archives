No, you'd lock the encounter.  Once it's locked, no one except
you can get XP or loot.   If you die or zone or run out of aggro
range, the rest of the group respawns.  So you can't split a
group encounter that way, at least not for XP.

Yes, but that happens immediately.  You don't see non-locked
mobs running around at low health.  Regen is VERY quick.
Buffs - and I assume debuffs - also work differently.  Most of
the 'useful' buffs are group-based.  If you're not grouped the
buff drops immediately.  As a guess the same logic is used
for debuffs - if the encounter isn't locked (grouped with the
caster), good-bye debuff.

I'll have to check the only "loophole" I can guess *might*
work:  encounters only lock on offensive action by the
player.  So social aggro doesn't lock mobs -- you can
'train' without locking mobs.  (But they don't drop off
very easily -- I've seen social aggro'd mobs run right
over a player at 10% health or less...)  But druids, at
least, get damage shields -- so it *might* be possible
to social aggro a mob, let it beat on the druid, then have
another player lock the encounter.  I'll have to look to see
if damage shield damage locks an encounter without the
druid ever casting on a mob...
