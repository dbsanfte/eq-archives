On Brell there are 2 Bots in PoK who have been there for a couple of weeks.
One is a cleric and the other an enchanter.  Walk up to one and  say "hi"
and you will recieve KEI or Virtue.  People are constantly /ooc'ing for
others not to use these bots and talking about how horrible ebay is.  I know
several people have petitioned them, but from what I can tell no
disciplinary action has been taken.  The 2 bots are still there - around the
clock.
