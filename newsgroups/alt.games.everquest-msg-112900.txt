If your not an enchanter, don't do jewelry. Really.

You need to seek out the trivial guide for jewelry if you are intent
on making jewelry. It tells you what stats are derived from each piece
and when you can no longer gain skills by making them.  

I am at 161 jewelry at level 30 - low level gold jewelry. It costs a
fortune, but if careful you can even make money at low levels with an
enchanter.
