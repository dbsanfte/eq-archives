Damage shield spells and pets that cast, summoned bandages and food as a
bonus.

The pets taunt/root/bash/cast so the amount of down time or number of low
level heal spells a pali needs to cast is greatly reduced. With summoned
bandages and a mage with decent bandaging skill, you never have to come rest
up from less the 1/2 life.

If it is a high level mage, damage shield spells like lava do ~25 points a
round for everything that hits you while the pet is doing the same kind of
damage. A mage, a pali, a pet, and a shield spell on the pali or pet, is
like 4 on 1.  Since the pet and you are doing the damage, the mage can
actually bandage you or heal the pet during the fight vs keeping the monster
targetted. If a mage has to kill a runner, they burn almost as well as
wizards while their pet will be bashing and rooting it to slow its escape.

Takes a bit of style. I mean if you are using the pet to tank then it is the
one who rates the shield spell and mage has to heal it. If you are the
tanking, you get the shield spell and bandaging or the mage burns the mob.

Mage works well with just about all areas with the exception of dungeons
IMO: For instance, a rogue will get a ton of backstabs with a good taunting
pet or an earth elemental rooting a runner.

What keeps magicians from being more popular is their pets are often lowest
level in a group so they draw attacks from junk monsters, lots of wasted
time killing them. Someone also referred to the mages summon elemental spell
as "Summon Train". Kind of funny because even with commands like "/pet guard
here" it is true. When a mage gets "You no longer have a pet to command"
message and "/gsay Time to get out of Dodge" it is really time to zone.
