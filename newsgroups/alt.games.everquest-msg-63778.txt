Verant underestimated the number of sudden log ons at the same time and the
server crashes immediately.

There will be so many trying to download the patches when the servers are
back up that even those with T3 connections will feel like 14.4 modems on a
bad day.

Someone at Verant will about crap their pants wondering how they can predict
the maximum number of people who try to log on at the same time.....then
they will realize that that number can't (well...technically shouldn't)
exceed the number of SoL copies produced (legally).

About 2 or 3 hours the population on all servers will suddenly drop as
people realize that Tuesday, December 4, 2001, is both a work and school
day.

About 15 minutes later the populations on all servers will return to close
to what it previously was now that bosses and teachers got a massive amount
of sick day call-ins.

I'm crapping my pants because Tuesday is my day off, I go back to work
Wednesday, just in time for UPS to deliver my "pre-release order" of Shadows
of Luclin. :(

I'm missing last year when starting just a few days from now (about 3 or 4)
I didn't have to bother showing up for work or calling in due to about 12
days of unused PAID vacation time that had to be used by the end of the year
(with the last 2 weeks already filled), plus still a few sick days they
wouldn't mind if I used either. :(
