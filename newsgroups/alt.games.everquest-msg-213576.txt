Make a social key that reads

/g This
/g is
/g a
/g Cant
/g Seminar.

Move it to one of your hotkey slots, for the sake of arguement lets say slot
9

Select thieves cant from your language list (if you can't remember which
language it is, try /lang help, which will list the ones you know and give
you their number.  If its the 7th language, then type /lang 7)

repeatedly mash 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 for
about 15 minutes

OR, assuming you tied 9 to your left turn arrow to make getting sense heading
skill or Mend skill or something like that up, just tie it to 9 and ignore it
for the next half hour.

Problem with doing this is that the group says spam your group chat channel,
making it hard to tell what people are saying.  An easy work around for that
is to creat a chat channel, say /chat cunning:linguist, and have everyone
join it, then do all incoming messages and fighting orders and general
chatting in that channel, and ignore the spamming group messages (you can
even filter them out, or put them in a different chat window, if you like).

Best thing about doing this in a group is that everyone can play; each pick a
different language, or all but one pick the same language, depending on who
needs which languages and who doesn't.

Each time you hear someone say a line in a language in group chat, you have a
small chance to raise your skill in that language, until your skill is higher
than that of the person talking.  With 5 people talking to you at once you
get 5 times as many chances.  So its over pretty quick.  But 6 people all
speaking different languages will potentially give each person 5 new
languages in the time it took one person to learn one language with only one
talking.

Its possible to learn via says and tells, but it seems to be extremely rare,
I'd stick with group.  Chatting seems to be free of language, so that won't
help at all.
