Let me tell you how those of us who only had the Kunark expansion did it.
Once you hit level 20, go to Lake Of Ill Omen and hunt until your high 20s
or even until you reach level 30.  At 27 you are a good level healer to join
a group at the Sarnak Fortress.  You could also go to Frontier Mountains and
find a group near the Giant Fort.  Then once you are around 32-33 then go to
Over There.  You can stay in Over There until you reach 37 or 38.  Then the
exp starts taking a big nose dive and it is time to do your time in
Dreadlands.  You can find groups to hunt with in Dreadlands all the way to
level 50 but you will not want to stay there that long.  Once I hit 47, the
exp was too low to stay.  Then there are many options.
