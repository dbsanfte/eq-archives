That's utter bullshit. You can learn everything you need to know about
the class itself without being 65. You can't refine tactics needed at
those levels without it, but you can know all of the spells,
statistics on how they perform in comparison to others, etc by doing
research. Yes, you are coming across with the "uber elitist attitude".
It's a fucking ignorant attitude at that.
