    The Lanys server message board has a charming feature called "the
Shit List" that does seem to do it's job pretty well from what I have
read.  People who get shit listed do seem to notice it impacting how
their playtime is going.  I have read threads where people where
shitlisted, admitted thier involvement and scoffed/mocked the person who
put them there, only to appear later in the thread sounding very
contrite, offering to make amends, and begging that they be removed from
the list.  Funny funny stuff, as you might well imagine.

OT sorta:  One of my favorite eq stories comes from this board.  I can
find the thread if anyone really wants me too.

 Seems a very very persitant and annoying beggar was harassing people
for a long time. He was famous for it. And he got verbally abusive to
whomever wouldn't give them his legs or whatever. He was despised by the
whole server, pretty much.

    One player, who by the account of the person telling the story was a
very nice guy, put 1000 plat in the trade window of the beggar. Then
he... did nothing. At first the beggar was very polite. "Sir, are you
there? Hello sir?" but soon started cussing at him. He still did
nothing, just let the trade window up with 1000p in. Then player went to
bed. Woke up, got dressed, whatever. By the time he got back to his
computer ten hours had passed. And the trade window was still open, the
beggar still responding to tells.

I don't know if this is a true story, but I hope it is.
