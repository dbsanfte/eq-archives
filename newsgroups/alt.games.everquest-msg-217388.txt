From the shadows, the mysterious bendr@hotmail.com (Axster) (if that
IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

You can't assume it will be done in an hour, though. You have to
expect to be there the whole 90 minutes. Add to that the 30 minute
prebuffing and end stuff of splitting and randoming etc and you get
2.5 hours you have to guarantee yourself.

And I prefer MMC and Ruj for similar reasons... but I'm not going to
screw groups out of a tank by refusing to group anywhere else. Many
others, however, are doing just that.

Add to it the fact everyone has already seen everything LDoN has to
offer, other than the hopelessly borked raids, and its no longer
opinion.

That's not relevant to the point the OP was trying to make (and
failing). He was claiming LDoN made high end raiding unnecessary.

Your brain may be the best ever, but put that brain in the equipment
of someone without raid gear and you'll never get further than the
next upgrade stage. Many don't like to believe this, but its the sad
truth. You don't generally go far in luclin end encounters without
putting your guild in high end velious stuff, you don't get your
elemental flags very often without getting your VT equipment (its
possible but most can't), and you don't get into time without having
your elemental gear. Just the way it was designed to work.

LDoN might get you to velious level gear. It won't get you any
further.
