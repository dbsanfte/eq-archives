I think it really depends how long you have been playing EQ. If you are a
more experienced player and have hunted most places I would definately
recommend getting it. If you are a newer player (who for some reason isnt
expansion enabled) the need may not be as high as the world is still new and
exciting. Also, what level are you? if you are 30+ then definately I would
recommend getting it as it opens up many more hunting opportunitys. Heheh
another consideration is, what are you PC specs? Got a good vid card etc?

anyway, hopefully something for you to ponder over.
