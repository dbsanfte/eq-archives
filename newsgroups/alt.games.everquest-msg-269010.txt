Ever hunted in PoI?  Were you there when the warrior demonstrated the
near-ultimate broken combo?  If you were, then you saw both the ultimate PL
and the effect it has on everyone else.

Approximate description - Someone found the ultimate combo for a warrior, an
AA ability (I think it was) that guarantees your weapon would proc, and the
Earthquake Sword.  The ES has a proc, something like 350 damage.  However,
it's cumulative for each creature damaged.  Hurt one, it takes 350. Hurt 2,
they each take 700.  Hurt 4, they each take 1400.  As stated, there's an AA
that either guarantees a proc or severely ups the chance of getting one.  He
got the AA and he got the sword.  He then went into PoI and ran around
grabbing every creature in the zone.  He circled them, waded in, and
procced.  Every mob took something in excess of 100 X 350 damage, over 35K
to every mob.  No survivors.  The rogue grouped with him reported that his
chat screen went zzzzziiippp with kills, ding, zzzziiippp with more kills,
ding, and then reported the last of the kills.

Even if he lets you keep your mob, if your mob's in the area of effect, it's
dead too, with him likely getting the kill.

If he can wipe the entire zone, does it affect your gameplay?  You betcha.

Probably yes.  Why?  Because the easiest stuff to kite is most likely the
singles near the entrance.  The result is that you're grabbing, by yourself,
most or all of the few mobs that are available for the solo hunters.  (I
don't know for sure; I don't hunt PoD.  But that's a reasonable description
of why.)

If that's all he's doing, no.  But that won't be all that he's doing.
They'll spend less than a minute killing every mob at B2, then they'll look
around for something else to kill.  The druid will look over, see you
wasting time killing just one mob in B1, and using the "not fighting, not
yours" rule, will come over, collect every mob you're not currently whacking
on, and pull the whole lot over for the others to kill, again in less than a
minute.

To a lesser extent, yes.  If you're both hunting in the same area, he'll be
able to hunt non-stop, which means that while you're killing one, resting
one, he's killing two.  Unless the spawn rate in the area exceeds the rate
at which both of you kill, there'll soon be no creatures left, and he'll
always be ready to take the next one before you.
