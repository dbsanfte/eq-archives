What would you suggest to make the monk more "group friendly" ?  A lot of
this thread has been about better mitigation, but since monks aren't to be
MTs better mitigation isn't helping them be more "group friendly" in any of
the ways you discuss.  Increased damage output?

What skill or ability do monks currently lack that if granted to them would
increase their ability to get into groups?
