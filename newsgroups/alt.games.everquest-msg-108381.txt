    Trak's likely a bad example because of the Prot being there to be dealt
with as well. And a lot of raid groups that can get to Trakanon are just as
able to put Trak down before the second breath weapon. Curiosity question:
how close to Trakanon could a group get using Invis? What sees through down
there? (No, don't count that obnoxious Dar that can spawn at zone-in.)
