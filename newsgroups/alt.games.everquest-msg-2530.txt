I just downloaded the 3/29 patch, and now EQ crashes when I
try to change the resolution.

I'm running W2K, Nvidia 6.50 on a GeForce (original), 512M RAM,
etc.

As a related note -- does anyone else think that the designer's
decision to make the resolution change menu only available after
you've spent several minutes loading/connecting is retarded?

Oh well... hopefully, there's a work-around.  Until then, I guess
I'm stuck at 640x480.

Thanks,
Mike
