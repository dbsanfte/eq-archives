> You're not high enough level for it's effect to proc.

And to head off the extremely obvious follow-up question, "proc" is short
for "process," which is still about as clear as mud, but simply means that
the built-in spell requires you to be a certain level before it will go off.

Velium weapons have a "proc" of Velium Shards (something like that) which
does a whopping ;) 10 points or so damage over and above actually just
hitting someone with the weapon.  It doesn't "proc" on every hit, how often
it procs is dependent mostly upon luck and how high your DEX is.

No, I don't know what level Velium weapons require to proc.
