loot is relative to level. you're not going to find mega phat lewt anywhere
at level 9.    you might want to check out East commons at the orc camps.
if this is your first character PLEASE avoid paludal - you will learn all
the wrong things there and you will be totally spoiled for XP because there
is no where in the rest of the game that you will see experience like that
and you might get very frustrated at the "slow" levelling progression
afterwards.  DO check out Crushbone.  Blackburrow is another place to hunt.
