You can hire an elite force of really big fat big-rigs to straddle the
lanes. ^_^ I always get a chuckle when I see them doing that for just this

I'm enough of a sap that I'll usually still follow the "let one person in

with someone talking on their cell phone.  That combo offends me on so
many levels I usually block them.
