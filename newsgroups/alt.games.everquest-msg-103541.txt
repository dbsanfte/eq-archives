A bit of a reminder for our challenged friends here:

At no time does that ever mean that is the 'only' thing it is meant
for (poor little Twohead's 'exclusively' claim), only that it falls in
the category of acceptable use.

And it does. Boasting in ooc, while more than a little lame, is not
against the rules at all.

And no amount of you people squirming is going to change that.

Keep spinning, kiddoes....
