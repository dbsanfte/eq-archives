    Sol A is perma-farmed on my server, and I imagine on yours as well. This
is typically what happens: players of level 35 and up zone into Sol B,
aren't insta-killed by a train. A few inquiries reveals that Pool is being
camped by a solo monk with a second account cleric healing him, King has a
small group of four in it that doesn't want others "slowing our XP", Bats is
camped by a Fungi Soloist, as is Bugs (two soloists in Bugs - they're tough!
:-/). Ragefire is camped so the Giants aren't up, and unless you have all
the components of a balanced group with you Efreeti isn't an option. So you
go to Sol A, pick a camp, and kill for items so your night isn't a total
waste. Especially since many of the items there will last you well into your
50's.

    If you WERE a legitimate group zoning in, you'd find:
(A) That you'd have to fight your way in just to get to a zone that can be
pulled to without flying headfirst into lava, and that if you had to USE
that zone it would drop you in a Greater Kobold's lap. Why are you pulling
to a zone? Well, because....
(B) If ANYONE dies, the group is shut down for the 10 to 15 minutes it'll
take them to get back to the group. Hope you brought a cleric, and that the
cleric wasn't the one to die....
(C) That half the goblins are crazy casters, and all the goblins are
runners - did you bring Snare?
(D) That doing the gnomes is nothing short of suicide.

    Upon finding this all out, you'd leave and go to OT with everyone else.

    James
