PoP as a whole, Sony decided against adding platinum loot to mobs.   Very
few things will give any coin at all.   Which is not to say that you can't
make money there, it just comes in different forms.   Even killing the right
things (the yard trash you're killing is most definitely not it.) you will
not make any coin loot, but instead you will randomly get vendor trash drops
that you can sell for a decent amount of coin.   Instead of getting 10 pp
per mob in coin, you'll kill 10 mobs, 9 of them will be empty, and the 10'th
will drop a diamond. (sells to a vendor for 125 pp) or a blue diamond (sells
for about 200'ish pp)

For Plane of Nightmare, to get good cash and experience, you'll need to
venture away from camping the entrance.   Nightstalkers are about the only
soloable thing (for some classes) that drop lots of gems.   Other than that,
your group will need to either kill Gargoyles and Banshees at Mujaki's
Cemetery, or Goblins and Mephits within the caverns (Excellent experience
well into the mid 60's and very good loot...  but you won't find many groups
willing to try them, since they are extremely challenging.)
