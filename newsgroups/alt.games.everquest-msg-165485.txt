Since the last patch, I've had this bizarre problem where my lag-o-meter
periodically goes off the scale... but sending or receiving a tell
sends it back to "normal". Even a "/tell x x", i.e. a /tell to a
nonexistent user, will "fix" it.

You may want to see whether this helps in your case.

I did a /bug on this, as with these symptoms there's no *way* it's an
ISP issue. (If you can figure out a way that using a particular facility
in the EQ client can cause an ISP to adjust their lag behaviour, without
some truly bizarre changes at the ISP, I'd like to hear it.)
