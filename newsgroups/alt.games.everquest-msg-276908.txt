What about Iksar shamans and BL's?  Are they in the same group as
monks/warriors or with the necros/SK's?  

I'm presuming also that necros/SKs are perma-KOS is because of their
class, not their religion, since all Iksars, regardless of class,
worship Cazic-Thule.  I noticed once when I made a DE cleric and a DE
necro (both Innoruuk worshippers) that the necro was "glares
threateningly" to the Qeynos guards while the cleric was only "glowers
dubiously" to them.
