its an npc in icewell up by the Dain in the throne room. Hail the npcs
in the alcoves near him. Icewell keep is at the far end of thurg, when
zoning in continue forward and up the stairs to the top level of the
keep. Don't fall into the hole in the center.

FYI: 

It won't be custom with luclin graphics. They are only "custom" with
velious graphics. So if you use the old models and velious textures,
you will see yourself with a custom helm. Its also not custom on
frogloks or vah shir, even though the vah shir have an "old" model
(they still don't have velious textures) I think on luclin models it
just looks like a regular helm, while on the froglok it makes it
appear invisible (no graphic)

So if you want it to look custom to the people with old models and
velious textures, go and see that dwarf.
