Once you get on a mob's hate list, it can generally hit you regardless of
the z-axis (i.e. how far above it you are).  For instance, if you whack
something on an island while levitating, then run across the ocean, you
still get hit when the mob swims after you.  In the case of a pirhana, the
thing to do is to get on land, where the prihana can't follow.  But as long
as you're over the water, it will be able to hit you no matter how high
you're floating.

Doesn't seem intuitive, but no less so than mobs going through walls to get
to you.  Just a weakness in the game engine.  As long as you know the rules,
you'll be able to avoid any future such troubles.
