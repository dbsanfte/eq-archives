The P4M (not to be confused with the Centrino, with which I have not 
experience) is a nice mobile version of the typical desktop P4 with 
facilities to throttle back the processing power when operating on battery 
power. I didn't see much difference between my P4M 1.7GHz and my P4 1.8GHz 
desktop as far as gaming performance goes. 

Of course, the much stronger video card in my desktop made it my obvious 
choice when at home.
