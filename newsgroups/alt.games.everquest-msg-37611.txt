Go back and read the word "spoiled" again genius, then look it up.
There's a huge difference between "won't log on without someone to rez
you" (*Your* words, by the way) and "Never even log on without her."
(which would be who's words again...... oh, yes. Mine.) 
  To make it easier up here in the thin air (Yes, stolen from you, but
it's just so damned cute) Let's just say it comes down to the difference
between "won't log on without.." and "never has to worry about logging
on without..."

There. That should clear things up for you nicely.
