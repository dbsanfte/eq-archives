www.everquestlive.com is marginally useful.  The servers are down if they
SAY they are down...however, they may still be down (or the login server,
which they DO NOT give the status of...grrr) even if they say UP.

My best indicator is how long it takes to pull up eq-live's page,
castersrealm, or allakhazam.  If those sites are slow, chances are the game
is down and a zillion other people are trying to find out what's happening.

Kinda like on Sept 11 last year when we were all trying to hit the different
news sites.
