    Incorrect. At the very least, right after they added the interior keys
to the ring they did not show up once you zoned out of VT. We went on one
trip there post-PoP where the rogue officer who had looted keys last trip
told us we needed to get keys again, he had none on his keyring. Then, upon
zoning in, he announced that they WERE there. He tested this by checking his
keyring after a death, while he was waiting on a res - they did NOT show up
until he was ressed back into the zone.
