Ah.  So he can't see the Enchanters and Bards, once so hugely in
demand, that are now stuck indefinitely LFG like some poor Rogue?
He didn't group with a 19 Bard booted from her group to make room
for a KEI'd 17 Cleric?  He's by definition unaware of the Enchanters
turned away by groups because "we all have KEI already", despite
their laments in-game, here, and elsewhere?  It looks to me like
it'd be simply awful to start a melee, hybrid, Bard, or Enchanter as
a new player nowadays.

The fact that they are distinct is irrelevent.  The fact that one
feeds and magnifies the effect of the other is what is key.  KEI
magnifies hugely some of the negative effects of player ignorance.
It's not a question of what is at fault, but rather a question of
what is.

Heh, pardon my sarcasm.  :)

Let's see.......Shaman with KEI goes solo, because she knows how well
she's going to do and doesn't have to worry about whether a_monk00 is
competent enough to be worth grouping.  Does the Monk get as much exp
as the Shaman?  NO!  Does the Monk benefit from the Shaman's KEI?  NO!
Did the Monk pay for the KEI?  In a manner of speaking, YES!  Because
he can't find a partner.

I've been turned down as a hybrid <with> KEI, because the soloers I
asked had KEI and didn't want to slow down their xp by grouping.  I
know this because that is exactly what they told me as they buffed
me after I asked whether they wanted to partner (nice polite folks
on the whole, don't see too many dr00ds in higher level xp zones
with little loot to pharm).

Groups of friends/guildmates always have been and always will be out
there.  And guess what?  They always have been and always will be
loathe to include a_random_player00 (yes, there are many exceptions,
but they are far outnumbered by those who behave as I described).

I see.  So it's ok to screw that fraction of the player population,
however large or small it might be, because you've got yours.

I don't.  My highest level caster (a 33 Druid on FV) has never had KEI
and probably will never buy it.  My 55 Paladin has grudgingly bought it
several times so that I could xp solo, since groups are hard to find if
you don't have large blocks of time to play uninterrupted.  Khosh is
right, KEI is hurting the game.  The fact that the "pain" is inflicted
upon only some of the players doesn't in any way compensate those who
are negatively affected.
