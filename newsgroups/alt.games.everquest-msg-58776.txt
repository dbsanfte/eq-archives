Because that's the question that was asked - not 'which is better', but how
much mana each item gives. :)

It is true that the highest of your INT or WIS effects how quickly you learn
non-combat skills, but the difference is probably not enough to be concerned
about over the gain in mana - if you're a caster, you'll likely have enough
INT or WIS to gain skills pretty fast anyway. If the mana gain is the same
and there are no other considerations (like AC), then by all means go for
the +WIS item. There is a rumour (at least for wizards) that INT over 75
reduces your fizzle rate as well, not sure if that's true though.

As an aside, many people who are heavily into trade skills (e.g. jewellery,
tailoring) will have a separate set of equipment that they wear to skill up
with to get their INT or WIS as high as possible - when each combine costs
hundreds of plat or more, every little bit can make a difference.
