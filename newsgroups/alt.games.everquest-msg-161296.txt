As far as I know, Halfpole was the first one to complain about the
signature. Of course, it is possible that others have been offended by my
signatures before, to my knowledge, no one else has complained.

You see, if Halfpole had sent me an actual email, rather than trying to
bitch at me on a newsgroup where it didn't belong, I would have been more
than interested in having a polite debate where others would not be 'forced'
(despite the fact that killfiles exist) to see my opinions. -But that's
another story.

If I had some quote that encouraged peace, love, and other crap, would you
have flamed me?

'This is a forum about Everquest - why do you have to drag your
EQ-irrelevant bias and love into it?'

Heh, I some how doubt you would have. Does the idea that not everyone thinks
the same anger you?

I wasn't trying to be funny. It's called being curt... surely you can
understand that.

To summarize, if the idea of other people having their own belief system
pisses you off so much, perhaps you should go ahead and killfile me or
ignore my signatures. It would save you a lot of trouble.

Or if you'd prefer, you're always free to berate me via email.
