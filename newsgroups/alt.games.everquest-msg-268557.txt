Oh!  You'd have to check the druid grove or something for specifics, but I 
know that the kittens at the entrance of HOH are DCable by druid.  And the 
rats in POJ (if you're helping someone do trial of execution these suckers 
will virtually assure a win).  I don't recall if druids can charm the little 
rats in COD but I think so.  Maybe the light blue/green ravens in Torment as 
well (I can't remember if I can).

I wouldn't use them to tank (that hour+ recast time makes them rather 
valuable to keep alive) but they're fantastic DPS for a druid.
