The real guards are at the entrance to the city.  Level 50, rather than
the wimps we put out on the bridges to give the good races the idea that
we are weak and not a threat.  If you aren't KOS to the ones at the city
entrance, it should be safe to enter the city to bind.  Although there
are several factions in the city, and so it might not be safe to wander
around, even if the guards outside don't hate you, I don't think
anything at all roams near the zone line.
