Something like that was going to be in UO2.  They were going to have an XP
debt.  When you died, the XP debt went up.  When you earned XP, it would
first go toward reducing the XP debt.  Only when the XP debt was gone would
XP go toward leveling.

The XP debt was also going to decay on its own over real time (not just
online time).  So, if you died, and then logged out, and logged back on the
next day, the debt from that death would be gone.  Or, die, and take a break
to go work on tradeskills for a while, while the debt goes away.

It would have been a nice system, I think.  For the casual player, who
levels slowly, a death would not have set them back much--most of their debt
would be made up in their offline time, or while they quest or do
tradeskills.  For the hard core XP grinding player, though, almost none of
their XP debts would be cleared up that way.
