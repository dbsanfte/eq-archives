This will asume that beg is ability 6 and kick is combat ability 3

/doability 3, /pause 1
/attack off
/doability 9, /pause 1       (6 social abilities added before combat
abilities so 6 + 3 = 9 )
/attack on

If you want to add another "combat ability" like Disarm or bash you would
but it as the first line, then add the rest of the lines.  The /pause is
1/10 of a second to acount for lag. the last thing you want is for the macro
not to turn auto attack back on.  Also /Pause can be added before or after
the action on the line and will always come after it. (ie. "/doability 3,
/pause 1"  and  "/pause 1, /doability 3" will both kick then wait 1/10 of a
second before moving on to the next line of the macro)
