these were probably bratty little sons of a single mother who get
their jollies by griefing people online. what they need is a man in
the house to haul their ass out behind the woodshed for a sound
thrashing when they engage in such sort of behaviour. these are the
same kids that cause petty vandalism and have poor grades from lack of
discipline and attention. they make me pro choice.
