Why do you even play this game?  You can't conceive of the fact that 
guilds can have fair and equitable loot distribution?  Could you 
distribute loot fairly?  Could you understand that the kill is more 
important than the loot?  Could you ever conceive of the notion of good of 
the guild?
The guilds I'm associated with, and the uber guilds I speak with, assign 
loot.  The loot rules are pretty clear, and if you come into the guild, 
you know what you're getting.  Any worthless piece of shit whiner who 
knowingly enters a guild with loot based on class rep decisions, and then 
bitches about it will get a jusitfied and deserved boot in the ass and 
/guildremove.  
You are exactly the type of person that loot rules are designed to 
exclude.  If you can't conceive of fair and equitable distribution, you 
will never be happy.  Join the local zerg guild, roll on everything, whine 
about how bad your luck is.  Then go /auction Blessing of Aegoism because 
you won the roll.
