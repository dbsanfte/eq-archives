He was concerned about Wuoshi and he asked about hunting in CS. I told
him how to fix his faction so it wouldn't be a problem.

If they were just after their CS key, no. If they wanted to hunt in
CS, WW, ToV, then an emphatic YES.

Passing through Skyshrine is no longer necessary. Prior to Luclin I
would take people through Kael, WL and SS to get their CS key. With
the removal of the keys, porting to WL and avoiding Kael is the safest
option if Wuoshi isn't up.
