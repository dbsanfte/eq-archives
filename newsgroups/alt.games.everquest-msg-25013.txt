If your charisma is 250 with an allied faction that can't possibly get any
higher, selling to a merchant (the only case where charisma would make a
difference) would still entail a loss, usually a substantial loss. The only way
to make money on a trade skill is to sell to other players, where character
charisma is irrelevant.
