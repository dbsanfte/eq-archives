CHeals should cause any mez or stun capable mobs to hate you with
a passion usually reseved for child molesters.  If you're trying
to add tactics that players use to the mobs anyway.

You could randomize the mobs attitude on engagement, some would be
smarter than others then, perhaps the mob's brother was tortured
to death by Druid or Shaman DoTs and so he hates DoTs more than
anything.  Could be fun, take the "mechanical" aspect out of it.
Might even be a start on negating some common PLing techniques ;)
