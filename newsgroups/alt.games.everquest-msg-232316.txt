Yea, once druids have their semi-complete heal, they become distinctly
popular for LDoN groups. With a fresh KEI on ya most groups at that level
will be fine with druid as healer, would rather go forth than wait around
some more for a cleric. You'll be getting fair exp, decent cash loot, LDoN
points, and rolls on augs and gear drops (since you also bring track to the
party with which the group hunts down the named in each dungeon). And at
lvl59 the stat augs you're rolling on are +5 or +6, which isn't to be
sneezed at as upgrades to your gear.
