I think predicting the RIAA's demise is premature.  Shutting down
the big distributors of stolen media (audio/video/whatever) alone
will be enough to keep the RIAA in business and wealthy.

What's the opportunity you're talking about here?

I think the primary value of the big media companies to artists
is the marketing rather than the production.  You can market your
music on the web, but that doesn't get your music played on MTV,
VH1, or thousands of radio stations world wide.

You can't sell lots and lots of your music if nobody knows about
it.

I look forward to the RIAA getting bitch slapped.  The arrogance
of wanting to control everything (including the hardware I use to
playback media) is astounding.

We'll see if they ever actually DO get bitch slapped, though.
So far, they seem quite effective at buying the government.
