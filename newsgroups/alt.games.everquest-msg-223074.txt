}hmmmm.... instead of just clicking and conning--and <reading> what the
}con is instead of depending on the color? 

Hmm.  Does changing that .ini file change the color of the text message 
when you con?  (Hope! Hope!)  95% of the time, when I con something, I 
could care less what color the con message is, I want to know what the 
faction-word is (ie, apprehensive, ally, scowls, etc.) And when the 
message is dark blue, it can be very hard to read. And any change of the 
chatbox background tends to make something else hard to read instead.  I 
so hope this fix will let me turn the dark blue into lavender or tan or
something. :)

}I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but don't presume to tell me what I
}should be thanking people for. 

We'll expect you to Fedex your thank-you note by Friday, Biz. :)
