Well, that's actually commendable! :-)  It's nice to hear people say
they want to level their character on their own and not be PL'ed to
level 60 by their high-level main.  

You might have missed out on this with your chanter, but I remember
the level 12 "Thicken Mana" spell, as well as the other mana spells,
used to only be sold at the brownie village in Lesser Faydark.  Of
course, brownies are KOS to everyone (except wolf form or certain
illusions) so chanters had to come up with different ways to try to
get into the brownie village, like cast Alliance to become non-KOS,
then Minor Illusion to become indifferent (then gate out).  But now
they also sell the mana spells at Highhold so that's not an issue.
