Ummm...

What do you mean by "the price"?  It's not something you'll find on a
vendor, so the price is whatever you can convince someone to sell it
for.  It's a rare enough item that I'll bet there's no consensus on a
reasonable or normal price range.

Prices even for common things vary by server quite a bit as well, so any
sort of price check should specify where you're looking.
