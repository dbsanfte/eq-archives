Now leeme see after the Thetans occupy clams they become Scorpians in
the FoB?

When do they go theough the Skorpikii phase?

I live all to close to CLearwater, and I had to work at an outfit
infested by them (meaning Scientologists not Scorpians). The first
book they handed me was the "Hat Book" by LRH as a training manual.
What a heap of trash...
