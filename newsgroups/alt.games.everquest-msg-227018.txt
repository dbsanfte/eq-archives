Thats really pushing it ;) Very often, people dont mind a druid as a
healer because they bring other utility as well, but I have yet to
see a group looking for a healer say 'sorry, we wanta druid' to a cleric,
*ever*. Let alone 'very often'. Prefers. Pfff ;)

Its nuts. Druids cant heal for 20 levels, and then *bang* get it all
at once ;)

plays 4 hours a day 5 days a week and levels to 60 in a few months ;)
