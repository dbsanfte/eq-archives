Put it in your range slot for  a little extra resist buff, other than that
they are pretty worthless.

As far as I know, worthless

The ones that open up when you click on them (also nodrop) are for the Gem
Encrusted Gauntlet Quest.  For the quest you need all four scrolls.  You can
tell what they are, because when you click on them they open up to read and
in the text in the upper left corner they are numbered.  Look up the quest
on Allahkazam to do the rest.

The other ones are worthless as far as I know

> Helle Splitpaw-Haut (looks like illegible cantrip from EC orcs)
New item? Sorry no help there

> A Split Paw
As far as I know, worthless, maybe for faction turn-in somewhere though.

> Gnoll Hide Lariat
Used to be worth a few plat to newbies, now I doubt it. Pass it on to a
newbie or sell for a few gold to a vendor.

> Split Paw Hide Belt
> Split Paw Hide Mask
> Split Paw Hide Tunic
Suggest selling these in the bazaar, they won't bring much, but check
prices, at least you could get a little more than from a vendor.  Maybe
5-10pp each.  The gloves will bring a little more if you ever get those.
