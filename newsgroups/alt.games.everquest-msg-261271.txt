Except in this case its reasonably justified.

Why have a design vision that portrays an Epic Ranger questing his heart 
out to achive the ultimate Epic Bow... and then at the same time having 
a design vision in which Rangers are a melee class first, and the bow 
thing is just a little extra that they can use situationally.

What kind of moron thinks the result of an epic quest *should* be a 
little extra that they can use situationally.
