I rarely read posts of the nature you're talking about.  I used to read a
lot more but after a while the signal-to-noise ratio needs adjusting and I
find myself reading very few posts anymore.

I imagine his name is mentioned in posts regarding ubercritters/uberzones,
right?  My guild isn't quite even "Tier 1" yet (from some list I have...no
idea if it's "common knowledge" but sounds ok).  We'll be taking Inny down
next month and HoT (one of the wings of Temple of Veeshan, for those who
don't know) inside a couple months, but that's pretty easy.  When my social
guild can take down CT then maybe I'll care enough to start reading FoH
threads...but quite honestly, probably not.  We tend not to care much how
the big-boys do it...we have more imagination than they do...their way may
work but it's boring.
