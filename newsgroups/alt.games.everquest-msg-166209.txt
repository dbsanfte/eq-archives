I'm going to ignore the EULA issue, since that is boring. :-)

The big problem with buying/selling equipment for real money is that it
provides a tie between the in-game economy an the real-world economy, giving
a big advantage to people who are doing better in the real-world economy.
Some aspects of EQ are competitive between players (e.g., getting into
a group), and one of the attractions of a game like EQ to many people is that
their in-game position is *not* derived from their real-world position.
