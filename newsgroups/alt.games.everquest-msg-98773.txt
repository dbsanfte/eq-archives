I would start with Emerald Jungle, most mobs will be green or light blue, but 
easy escape and enough undead that your friend can play with those mobs.  Then I 
would move into City of Mist, and learn to pull from semi-crowded spawns.  Once 
your friend has that down, I would recommend Lower Guk, dead side.  Start out 
with easy stuff like Ass/Sup, move downstairs into Sage, then work until your 
friend can break Frenzy or Lord room.  
This progression should teach your friend how to use his basic spells, learn to 
control his pet, learn to break spawns, and finally learn how to use his undead 
charms in dungeon situations.  Once your friend has this down, start partnering 
and learn how necros can ghetto heal and such.  Grouping necros are very, very 
versatile, and I for one will always have one in my group.
