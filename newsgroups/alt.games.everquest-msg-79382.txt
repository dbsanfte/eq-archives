Well, in at least one case, and for one class, it is neccesary to kill
at least one guard, and afterwards, all of them if you ever want to
enter E or W Freeport again.  I am, of course, talking about Sir
Lucan, for the Paladin Soulfire quest.  Having completed this one
quest with one guildie, I know faction with the Freeport Militia goes
to absolute bottom.... Ah well.

And, if going to Guk, and a basher or guard jumps me, I will kill it
as well... newbie area or not.  Same thing going to Lavastorm to hit
Sol A or B... DE hits me, it dies...  just another mob.


As for the cussing, that is definately an offense that some GM's will
ban for, regardless of the curcimstances... 

And, finally, the only zones I can think of where a 13 might be that a
guard will help are WC and Oasis... and the only thing you might be
fighting would be dervs... which the guards won't help with.
