Our guild started out using a mailing list. For various personal
reasons, it didn't work as a sole communication tool. Since most
people can't get to private Usenet servers from work (with NNTP ports
commonly blocked by corporate firewall,) we went with an EZBoard as
our secondary means of communication.

Besides, neither a mailing list nor a private news server allows you
to communicate with the rest of the (EQ) server.
