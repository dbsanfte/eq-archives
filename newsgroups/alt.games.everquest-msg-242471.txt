I disagree, as stated in another post in this thread, it will only get him
access to PoS / PoV and at lvl 56, he has this access anyway, so stop
complaining.  I really doubt he's done the Askr the Lost quest in PoS to get
to BoT yet.

As for looting the EP, he could always MQ if for the person that wins the
roll.  Better than letting it rot or the other non-associated group stealing
it.
