sometimes after a really long camp (HoT comes to mind) i will sleep and
dream that i've won whatever i was looking for

i might i wake up and think "oh, better check bazaar for someone wanting to
buy the mq to that bp for 70k"

then i realize that HoT bp's dont mq for 70k anymore......

then (*cry*) i realize i don't even have the mq, because i didn't loot
anything, because i went to bed =(

so the goofiness of my dreams involves some kind of time warping
