I agree. Which is why I kick myself that I want to play a "good" iksar.
But it's just that...I like iksar...and I like how pretty Qeynos is.

I keep trying to come up with good backstories, but in the end they
usually end up sounding contrived. :/

I suppose I could have been a neutral iksar, but Foxeye is neutral, so I
wanted to actually pick sides for once.
