Let me give you the viewpoint of 100days played on a mage - Mal-x
is VERY low aggro.  It is my pull spell of choice because my pet
has never had a problem getting aggro after it.  I can Malosinia
on incoming when the MT has just put a few arrows into the mob with
no aggro.  Never, ever hesitate to Malo early.
