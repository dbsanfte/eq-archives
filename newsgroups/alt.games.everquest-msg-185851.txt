The problem is that it doesn't matter how cheaply he can cast if his 
spells are always resisted. Levels are greater than all in EQ. Things 
that used to be a major problem are suddenly easy after you gain a level 
or two.

Having said that, I don't think that I would level to the exclusion of 
everything else because there are some very nice AAs available. Run3 is 
definitely something I would go for right away and probably some other 
things.
