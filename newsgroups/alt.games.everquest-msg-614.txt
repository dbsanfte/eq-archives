As far as I know you can't cast a spell while running.  I do know 
there are a few select items that have spell effects that you can 
cast while running, but I'm not sure which ones they are, and I 
think I've heard of some of them being nerfed to remove that 
ability.

By the way, a tip to avoid the "interrupted" when you stop and 
cast: when you stop, turn just a little to the left or right 
before casting (I mean, quickly tap the key just enough to make 
the screen move a little).  The client registers this more 
accurately than just a plain stop.
