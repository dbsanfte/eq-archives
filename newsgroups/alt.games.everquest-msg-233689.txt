Sorry to dredge up a dead thread, but: Ack! No! Someone I know apprenticed with
them for a while. Moved across country for it and everything. He ended up
leaving 3 months early because the stuff they made was waaay below standard,
and he wasn't learning anything (and a few other reasons that don't really
factor into the discussion here). Now, maybe they've changed in the last few
years, but Buyer Beware!
