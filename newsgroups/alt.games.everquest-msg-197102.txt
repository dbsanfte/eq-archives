Or as someone pointed out, a bard.  Level one necro, level 4 bard, and I
bet level 25 SK or something like that (in keeping with the way the game
tends to hand out spells to hybrids.  For sure at least level 9)  Bard
though, in your GFay example, would be ideal since they won't likely be
KOS, and Wood Elf bards actually start the game there.

6pp with decent cha and faction, it can get more expensive than that.  3
charges, so its 2pp a charge.  Did you have at least 2pp of gear on your
body? Probably, in which case its a good buy if you were clever enough to
keep money in the bank for such an occaision.

Its possible to carry the rod on your cursor, then swap it for a bag, use
the rod, and swap back to the bag.  Why you'd be walking around using a
rod if you have 8 bags on you, I don't know, but it could happen.  Very
rare indeed that a item can be clicked on to use inside a bag (I can't
think of a single example) so this is a good workaround for those that
carry 8 backpacks (how would that look in Real Life?)

An excellent trick for this: when your forward movement is obstructed,
dont turn to bypass the obstruction.  Hold down the Control button on your
keyboard and then use the left or right arrow; instead of spinning in
place, you'll slide left or right while retaining your facing.  If you
don't move far left or right, then you'll still be headed almost directly
for your body.  Next tree you hit, use the same trick but slide back the
other direction.

Also, make a social key that says /corpse.  Move that to a hotkey slot.
(for example, hotkey slot one) Now while you are running, be continuously
clicking the Corpse key (1 1 1  11 1  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1) as you go.  Often
you won't actually see your body for one reason or another, its behind a
tree, its up in a treetop, its under the world... but when you get in
range, you'll stop getting the "your corpse is too far away to summon"
message, instead getting a "summoning Lozer's corpse" message, and your
body will pop behind you.  If you are in a dangerous spot, you can just
keep running and dragging till you get somewhere safer to loot, or at
least to a place you can find easier next time.

A good idea, besides those others have mentioned (getting a loc etc.) is
to try and die near terrain features; a path, a wall, something you can
see from a distance; this will probably let you find it without having to
use one of the various locate corpse plans.
