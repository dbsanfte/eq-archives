If you want to figure it out mathematically, you need the rest of the
components.

Strength, ATK, weapon skills, etc. (some damn near impossible to figure out,
like AC of target, how that AC impacts your DPS, etc.).

So the best way to figure it out is to parse both options and just find out
which does more damage for you.  That way you don't have to worry about the
mathematics of it.
