There's an immense flood of the market with Picnics, Lucky cabbage and lotus
pie, and to a lesser extent, star ruby steins, but I've actually never seen
anyone publicly selling blessed fishing poles yet, and the sickle, robe and
idol are difficult to find.  Oddly, the champagne rarely seems to be for
sale, but no one ever needs to buy it.

Given the cost on my first earring (with LOTS of component gathering), I'd
probably buy a kit for the second if/once they get down to under 15k (at
20-25 on Tarew marr right now), I really don't want to go through the crap I
had to to get the first one again.
