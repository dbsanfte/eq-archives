Perhaps illegal was a poor word.  How about against the rules.

Spoofing means changing the headers plain and simple.  What it boils
down to is that you're not following the rules of Usenet.  That's what
started this whole arguement.  Rules are meant to be followed and you
aren't following the rules of Usenet.  Sure, they don't have much bite
now with every clown and his brother on but in the hallowed days before
about 1995 they did.

Really now, I put forth that changing your "reply to" is against the
rules.  Show me differently please.  What?  You can't?  Turn your
keyboard over to your ISP and get out and see the bright world that
exists outside - you might enjoy it.
