Without a doubt the Nexus has cost Druids in a big way. We have no
ports to Luclin or around Luclin. Traffic in the TP biz is way down
because of it. Now Im sure some would say awwwww too bad but if you
are going to affect the income of one class so severly then give them
something in return at least. We got nothing from Luclin but some
fairly lame spells. 
Consider this what if all of a sudden Druids were given the ability to
rez, or create a strong perm pet or giant increases in DD spells? WHo
would be screaming then? Clerics, Tanks, Mags, and Wizs thats who and
rightly so.
