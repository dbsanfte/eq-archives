A hypothetical situation; you were fighting in Dreadlands as a level
45 (hell level) when the group was over-confident / unlucky and
managed to get wiped out. The first on the scene has a cleric friend
nearby who is level 49 and willing to help. After a few minutes, when
the cleric gets around to you, you get the following /tell....

"Are u rdy 4 a rez?"
