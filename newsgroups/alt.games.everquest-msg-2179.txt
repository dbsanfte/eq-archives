Hello,

My Gnome necro went to kill sirens after he hit level 12.  I bought a
Dragoon Dirk and a Stein of Moggok before I went ( spending all my money ).
I killed the two level 12 sirens over and over and got to level 14.  Now,
those two are blue, and so are the 3 that are on the other island.

Very boring.  Engulf, heat blood ( ? ), send pet, leach, melee til dead,
dark pact.  Med up, and the next one pops, perfect timing.

Unless I am mistaken, the 3 "tougher" ones require a magic weapon.  This was
evidenced by my pet never hitting one as I fought it.  As a level 12 Necro,
I can only comjure level 9, 10, and 11 pets.  Or so I hear.  And, I hear
that it takes a level 10 pet to hit something that required magic.  So, that
being true, I must have had a level 9 pet.

Since I am not going to be able to get someone to jump of the boat and con
my pet for me to see if it is level 10 or 11, I plan on going back and
trying to pull 1 of the tougher sirens and see if my pet can hit it.  If it
can't I can either keep trying pets until one can, or just go kill the
easier sirens.

The major problem is this is pretty boring, unless I strike up a
conversation with someone soloing Sisters.   I'm a yellow bubble short of
15, so I am interested in hearing where you guys think I should hunt after I
get that bubble.  I have -no- cash.  After I hit 13, there was a guy selling
a Green <Something> Drape for 100pp in OOT.  It has AC 8 ( or 9 ) +3 int +9
Dex +9 Agi +15 Poison Resist ( I think these are the stats ) so I went back
to orc hill and got and sold 55 belts for 1pp each and the person that I was
selling them handed me 45 more to buy the drape thing ( their 53rd level
Pally felt like being nice).  It's ugly, but it's nice for me.

So, where should a level 15 necro hunt?  I'm going to need money for 16th
level spells, so I was considering sacrificing Exp for $$$ and killing
Sisters.  I've never been on that island, but hear the $$$ is good.

Did I get raped on that drape thing?  I don't know what it's worth, but it
seemed like a good buy.

On the rock with the 3 sirens, one is further away from the others.  Can
this one be pulled w/o afggroing the others?

TIA!
-BEP
