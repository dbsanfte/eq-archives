Subject: I am trapped

I was running and I got my character trapped in an upper level Freeport Militia
house stairway post. I tried moving in all directions and cannot move. I tried
to camp and exit out but cannot. I ctrl-alt-del out of Everquest hoping that it
would not save my position but it did. Does anyone know if it is a lost cause
and I have to delete my character. Maybe someone can kill me and have it reset
me to my home position. I am on Stromm server.
