Generally safer on the wall.  On the path you get annoying things like
Bixies and Skeletons that will attack anything no matter what level.  Then
you either have to drag them all through Kithicor, or stop to fight them.  I
suppose it wouldn't hurt, but I never liked the idea of stopping in
Kithicor, even during the day.
