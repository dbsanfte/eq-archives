LOL...you must not have spent a lot of time in FV.  I spent levels 29-40 in
FV off and on (still good exp).  Vekis is a nasty iksar necro w/pet and the
bane of almost anyone who makes the FV-LOIO run.  Usually, someone will
shout when she is up (I believe it is female but have not gotten close
enough to tell <g>).  I believe she is lvl55 and can summon you back to her.
She is usually near the statue that straddles the waterfall at the end of
the stream.  I'm not sure which faction she is on but I think she is a quest
NPC for the iksar.
