One problem is that often a vendor will return to the general area that 
they are supposed to be after chasing someone, but they still won't sell. 
Most likely because they aren't in the *exact* spot they are supposed to be 
in.

Maybe I'm overlooking something, but why can't they just make it so that 
vendors can't be aggroed (or killed) in any way, shape, or form. Also make 
them immune to begging and pick pockets. 

In any event, I'm sure that GMs have more important things to be doing than 
resetting merchants because a_rogue00 decided to try to pick it's pockets.
