I don't know that I'd say any particular pet is better than another; it's a
situational choice. Pick what you think you need given the circumstances.

Water pets are immune to poison and have middle of the road hps and damage output;
really nice for killing spiders and snakes and some people prefer them for general
solo use because the damage they do is a little higher than the earth pet but
their hps are better than the fire pet.

Earth has the most hps and can root (necessary if you're fighting solo somewhere a
runner will draw adds, since a mage has no root or snare of their own); but their
damage output is a bit lower than either fire or water pets. They are the best pet
if what you need is something that will definitely keep the mob off you and seem
to be the most popular pet for soloing. Also the best to use to practice pet
kiting (chain casting pets until the mob is dead) because the root will probably
buy you extra time to get the next pet up; although once you have the
technique/timing down, any pet can be used that way.

Fire has the best damage output, but lowest hps; good if you are in a group with a
real tank (tell pet not to taunt) or are willing to take some damage yourself to
keep it off him or if you just need to plow through a bunch of greens as quickly
as possible. Also good if you are fear kiting with a partner. Plus, they damage
shield themselves so you don't have to do it.

Air pets are a bit less durable than either water or earth (although they are more
durable than fire); but they cast stun spells to interrupt spell casting, so they
are great for fighting caster mobs. Air pets also cast invis on themselves when
they aren't fighting, although I have to admit I don't understand why that's an
advantage. . .
