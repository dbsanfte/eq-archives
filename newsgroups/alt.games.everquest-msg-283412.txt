I keep hearing the "wasn't available" logic, but it doesn't seem to me 
its that simple, lots of things that weren't available initially seem to 
be included, while other things aren't.

Seems people expect the newbie armor quests to be in place, for example, 
but not the tutorial?

Hell, if it was me, I'd make everyone start in the tutorial, and have 
there be an event to achieve (someone kills that beast who's name starts 
with a K) before "original" opens up!  That would start things off with 
a bang.  After all, its not called "classic" as someone else put it.

Also note that the tutorial wasn't available only to people who bought 
that expansion.

What about Paineel and the Warrens and Stonebrunt and the Hole?  Are 
they in the game at start?  They (and a bunch of other zones) were added 
later but not as part of an expansion.

Which Splitpaw will be there at start, there have been what, four?
