That's the only use I can see -- in EQ2.   Can't buff,
can't PL.    You'll miss some "Why are you here?" tells
if you're in a low-level zone (harvesting or exploring)
but get as many "why is your name a different color"
tells instead...

That doesn't work in EQ2 -- you can see level/class by
targeting and hovering.
