Wow, thats just ASKING for trouble. Why should WE have to check out YOUR 
story? Especially when it really doesn't concern us? Why not get your 
"friend" to post? Why not ask your friend for the logs and post them 
(not that that really means much)? I've gotten KS'd by another druid 
when I got the first shot off on Quillmane. Needless to say my magician 
was a bit upset. Did I petition? Nope.. as a matter of fact I had a 
guide waiting for my return tell (the shuttles weren't working to the 
boat to FV -  go figure) while I berated the drood in question to the 
zone. I really do wish people would wake up and smell the coffee - it's 
a game. And if you take it that seriously maybe it's time for a break. 
I'll never see an epic. I'll probably never see a dragon. Know what? I 
don't care... I do it for fun.
