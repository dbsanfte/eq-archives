This isn't really a spoiler anymore, but a slight warning might be in order.

Tolkien most defenitely wrote a male dominated story. Females hardly play a
role in it at all. From the top of my head, I can name three. Arven,
Galadriel and Bombadil's daughter. The first and last being mere footnotes
and the middle being just pretty really. BTW, why they cast Cate blanket to
represent the most beautifull woman ever is beyond me, Liv is prettier, or
at least I think she is.

It's funny, but when I was watching the movie, all kinds of names kept
running through my mind. Glorfindel was one of them, I couldn't for the life
of me remember who Glorfindel was. When the fellowship entered Lorien and
where ambushed by those elves I thought " Ahh, and there we have prince
Caelis, no wait that's another story, ok so it's glorfindel, must be.
Haldir? Who the fuck is haldir?" I had the same thing with the first shot of
Lothlorien."Ahhh, fair Kelethin, home sweet home, oh blast, Elvandar, my
bad, oh bugger, thingy, Lothlorien indeed" Reading is good, but reading to
much is poison to an organised mind.

anyway, still feeling rather hyper about it all. I read half way through the
two tower last night, suffice it to say, I wasn't much use at work today
