    That's my point from above, though. It isn't difficult. No, really, it
isn't. Those folks in Velk's would have more than enough Crystalline Silks
to make it past the Backpack trivial and into the 95% success region if they
wanted to do so, especially since all the rest of the needed supplies are a
zone away in Thurg. They don't bother because they can't be bothered - they
have other things they'd prefer to do with their time, or they can't be
bothered to go find out. The only thing a massive infusion of high-skill
"shawl" tailors has done on my server is raise the price of HQ Bear Pelts,
not lower the cost of 10 slot tailored backpacks.

    The Evil Eye bag is the same. I don't think there's a level 50+
character in the game that couldn't get to the Evil Eye and kill him. He's
almost always up, he (almost?) always drops the Bag. Yet level 50+ players
are buying Evil Eye bags from Qanan. Why? They can't be bothered to run to
Guk and go get one, or they don't know where it drops and can't be bothered
to find out.
