I wouldn't have given it back to you after you said this line:

>>"lol, you could have taken the spawn from me but you gave it up so it's
mine
again now"<<

Translated is "neener neener!!!" and that's not a nice thing to say.

BTW, I know of no way to bomb someone out of the game anymore.  It used to
be possible, but now they only allow you to send a certain amount of lines
of text per second (probably more in /groupsay, but I don't know for sure).

So my vote is for them.  It's time to go find something challenging to kill.
