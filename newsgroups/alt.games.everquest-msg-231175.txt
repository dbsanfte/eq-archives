Why is that such a difficult concept for you to understand that people 
find offensive...

Games like Asherons Call have monthly expansions, sure they aren't on 
the order of an EQ expansion, but over a year it sure adds up to a lot 
of value... and its all free. SoE gives us a couple new skills a few 
zones, makes the bank bigger, and wants 20 bucks to download the buggy 
mess. After a while you start feeling screwed.

EQIM was originally going to be 2.95 per month... for a lousy chat 
client! They claim they gave it away due to good Luclin sales... I 
figure they gave it away because nobody in their right head would have 
paid for it.

So your fine with popups on the way into the game, and GMs spamming 
about Lords of Everquest, but a sign in the PoK that says PreOrder EQ2 
at ebgames.com is the last straw?? I think you understand whatevery one 
is complaining about just fine!

It could be worse I guess...How about a $1.00 connect charge. (you know 
like long distance)? And maybe a per hour levy on top of the subsription 
rate (again like your phone), and per character charges for all your 
alts (like the extra outlet charge cable companies charge). Or maybe a 
surcharge when you install to 'activate your copy' (phone companies love 
setup fees when you move even just across the street with the same phone 
number)

SOE isn't as bad as a monopolistic utility, yet, but they're trying to 
get there. And the reason is the same, they've got a monopololy on EQ. 
AC, DaoC, etc are all competition, but they are not exactly 
substitutable, especially now that so many people have 1000s of hours 
invested in their characters... SOE is leveraging that time investment 
more and more... and it offends a lot of people. They've already paid 
10-13 bucks a month over 4 years and SOE squeezes them a little more 
every chance they get... sure we could quit tomorrow... but SOE knows 
you can simply sign up for a nother mmrpg... you'll lose your friends, 
you'll lose your character investment... surely that's worth another 20 
bucks right???

right???
