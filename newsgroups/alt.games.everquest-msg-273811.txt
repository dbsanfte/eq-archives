Just my 2 cents on this:

I think that the specifics for the policy (what words are not allowed)
is not the issue here.

I have not played on their servers (for any game), but from what I can
gather from this thread, you used a word which their filter traps and
censors. Then you used a misspelling of the word deliberately to avoid
having the word filtered.

Regardless of the reason for doing so, You were obviously deliberately
trying to evade the filter- abusing the system. If you disagree that
the word should be filtered, fine, but you should have addressed this
issue BEFORE you decided that the rule shouldn't apply to you.

I think your suspension was more for trying to circumvent the rules
than simply for violating them.

I'm sure you don't like it when someone gets by your e-mail filter with
a subject like:
"\/|a. G.ra"
It's the same concept, only in a more public location.
