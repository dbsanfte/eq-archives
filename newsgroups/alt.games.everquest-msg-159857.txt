Get into a fender bender with some old lady on her way to the
pharmacist, jump out of your vehicle screaming abuse at her for
having the effrontery to expect you to actually drive in a sane
and legal fashion when there's a fungi in the bazaar for 30k...
Later, after the commitment hearing, your family finally realizes
it was all about EQ and sues SOE, prompting a whole new round of
poorly researched and heavily slanted coverage in the mass media
for us to flame here.
