> So you are claiming he is incorrect?

I'm telling him he needs to /con more mobs. My original statement
was that more mobs were green /con at 65 than at 58 which he
disputed; and I'm telling him to walk around doing /con a little
more.

I dont see where they have patch notes from the game archived. I
see THIER news archive, but not the game patch (ie eqnews.txt)
files archived.

The full-group xp bonus he spoke of was replaced by SOE with a
"the 6th person dosent count when dividing xp" system, many many
patches ago.
