It's one of those tedious spawns that Iksar Monk's are, seemingly, expected to
camp if they want to do the Shackle quests. Does anyone know where, in Lake of
Ill Omen, it spawns? Although I don't want to camp it I'd also appreciate an
approximate spawn time.

Thanks in advance. 

Cheers Watchman. :)
