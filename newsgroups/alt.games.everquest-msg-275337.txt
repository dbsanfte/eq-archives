No, this is about your opinion and some psychotic persecution complex
combined with your issues with authority. You broke the rules. There's
no question about it. You went as far as to circumvent the filter,
which means you -KNEW- that you were breaking the rules. Take your
fucking pity trip elsewhere. If you expected sympathy from anyone
here, you're a moron. Take it to the Counterstrike newsgroup where
d00dz like you fester in their own shit and stay out of here.
