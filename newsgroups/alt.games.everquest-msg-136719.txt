Low-quality LCDs will ghost a bit, but that's getting rarer.  The big
problem is that LCDs A) only want to run at one resolution, and B) have
-very- sharp pixels.  A) is an issue when the game wants to run at a
resolution that isn't the same or an even division of the LCD's 
resolution...then you get borders and pixel interpolation, which usually
doesn't look so hot.  B) is an issue because texture art doesn't always
look so good when you can see every individual dot.
