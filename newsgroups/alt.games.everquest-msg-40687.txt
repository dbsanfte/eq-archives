Are you 60?

60 warrior taunt is light years better than 59< taunt. Especially if they
tie in the rage of vallon proc on the epic. If I factored the epic proc
into every warrior, the taunt would be a 10.

60 warriors also get triple attack, nobody else does.

5 then?

Wasn't really factoring criticals in. Hadn't thought of them at all,
actually. And this isn't a specific-to-raid issue, where defensive puts
warriors are a major damage output disadvantage. High end warrior weaponry,
triple attack, and best-possible melee ratings (except in pierce) combine
to give warriors a huge amount of melee hitting.

Realized this rating was a mistake. Wavecrasher, Willsapper, etc, give
warriors some formidable proc-based debuffing. Changed.
