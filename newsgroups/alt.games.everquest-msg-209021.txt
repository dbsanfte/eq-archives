True, its a BOTHERSOME bug, we got a rogue and a monk in guild who been 
level 50 for days now. But both of them got their AAs back when they 
delevelled to 50 for some reason :). They enter expansion zones just 
fine, our monk was in Tactics with us at level 50 at least.
As for you moving, byebye, have fun, enjoy SWG, which are ALSO a SOE 
game, and unless every review i read so far is wrong, the most 
buggy/unfinished online game the last few years (cant talk for OU and EQ 
  startup phase, only joined up after velious release), so if you dont 
think a few bugs in a expansion is ok, youre gonna get VERY dissapointed.

Now go away and troll over at the SWG boards about bugfilled games.
