Not conclusive, but Flighty Fiends in the Hole (Lvl 42 to 44) were all
dark blue at 54 and are *still* all dark blue at 55. Elemental warriors
run from 38 to 42. I'm getting less dark blues at 55 by a long shot, but
there's still a few. Primarily light blue, though. At 54 it seemed
almost an even split. I'm guessing dark blue for a 55 goes down to 41
minimum. For a 54, either 40 or 39. (Which would be in keeping with the
.75 * level model.)
