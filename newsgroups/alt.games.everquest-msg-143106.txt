This is a fairly old and very mature, stable and reliable NIC by now. 
Drivers for these have been available for a long time so I doubt this is 
the cause.

Are you using the latest VIA (assuming you are using a VIA chipset on 
your motherboard) 4in1 drivers?

Are you using the latest video card drivers?

Have you flashed your BIOS with the latest firmware?

Have you checked windows update for critical updates?

Are you sure you are not sharing IRQs?

Are you overclocking your CPU/video card?

One of the very annoying things about Windows is the way it does things 
automatically like choosing using ACPI for you without you intervening. 
If your BIOS supports ACPI, Windows 2k/XP will use it upon install. If 
you want to change that you have to disable it in your BIOS and 
reinstall Windows. ACPI forces the sharing of IRQs, which is not a good 
thing. Check under Device Manager to see whether you are sharing IRQs.

Another extremely annoying thing about Windows is the lack of diagnostic 
tools for it. As you have seen, a blue screen full of crap when hanging 
means nothing to us. After all, we as users are complete idiots in the 
eyes of Microsoft and should not be given the tools to diagnose faults.

Diagnosing faults under Windows feels like trying to find your way 
around a maze in pitch black darkness compared to diagnosing faults 
under Unix. Its pure trial and error. Try doing something and reboot, if 
it doesn't work put it back, try doing something else and reboot again. 
Repeat over and over until problem solved.
