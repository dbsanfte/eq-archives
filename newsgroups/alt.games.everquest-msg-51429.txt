Bring a team.  Way too many adds in the whole place. The potential for death is
high for just about any level.  Especially if there is low population of
players there which is most of the time.  Also you will probably wait several
hours for Maid to spawn.  (That has been my experience with full group killing
everything in sight).  

Happy Hunting!
