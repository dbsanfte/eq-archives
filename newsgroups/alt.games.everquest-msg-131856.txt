In case this isn't clear by the previous replies, your level 60 exp
will not automatically be shunted over. You have to change to
alternate advancement manually - pressing 'v' will bring up the AA
menu. This can be done as early as level 51, and you can split your
exp so a portion goes towards the regular bar and a portion goes
towards the aa bar instead of all in one place. But, again, you have
to turn this on yourself or waste every bit of exp you get after
filling up level 60.
