Looking to start hunting in Skyshrine soon, want to make 45 before going in,
was basically wondering whether this is plausible for my level? I've read
it's ok for 40 - 60's but the fact it suggests 60's can hunt there makes me
very dubious of the place. I'm actually after some Guardian armour if I can
get my hands on any, the gargoyles it drops off are meant to be mid 40's.
Anyone have any experience of this zone and is it plausible at my level? I
know the armour is no drop so at least the farmers won't bother with it.

Thanks

CF
