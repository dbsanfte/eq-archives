Ok ok ok, I'll break out the baby skeleton next time we play our evil
alts :p (I actually did want to conjure one the other night, only to
discover I'd accidentally banked all my chips... and I didn't feel
like bumming them from my friend) Rusty weapons might be a problem,
since not much of anything drops where we are now and I get encumbered
easily, but I'll keep it in mind if I come across a high damage rusty.

(I should probably play my mage more, just to get more into the use of
pets. My druid almost never charms animals)
