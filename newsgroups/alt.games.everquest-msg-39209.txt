Interesting theory.  To test it, I babelfished this text from english to 
french to german and back to english.  The result is much clearer:

time does not out ** hÃ.Â© I in new zone mean becouse KÃ¶rper up to 
look I tryed to have in order a pit name to verwurzeln not to 
operate trÃ¤gt to try death into then 30 drynesses I, dÃ.Â©clencher 
KÃ¶rper with 148HP ' left s to then look up =) I as one to strike I 
death i love to say carries =) memd Ã. Â   for each nÃ¤chste point in 
time to have root 

I apologize for the hideous special characters, but there it is. :)
