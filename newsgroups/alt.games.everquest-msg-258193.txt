Its one thing to change into a lange at the 'front' if its moving along 
at a good clip.

Its quite something else to change into a lane that's almost parked 
right at the front. Something else on par with cutting to the front of 
the line at movie theatres and grocery stores.

Worse, -you- aren't the only one doing it. If someones 50 car lengths 
from the exit in a packed lane, he shouldn't have to put up with 200-300 
cars running up to the front and merging in (theres always some sap who 
will let them in...often someone who just cut in themselves and is 
feeling generous because he hasn't been waiting 40 minutes to get where 
he is.)

The sad part is I'm not even going to advocate you change your 
behaviour. There is no point in -you- sitting in a parked lane while 300 
other asshats pull in front of -you-.

The solution has to come from better highway engineering (e.g. removing 
the ability for one lane to come to a crawl, while allowing people to 
merge right at the front. And this -can- be accomplished, often without 
too much effort.
