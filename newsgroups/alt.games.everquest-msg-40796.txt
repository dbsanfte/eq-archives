First off, I'd just like to complain about how resists 
were PRE-nerfed this time around.  I got online about 2 
hours before the servers came down for a patch and I 
couldn't mezmerize anything to save my *life*!  It's a 
plot!  A horrible, horrible plot to keep me from hitting 
level 8.  I'm certain of that.

Okay, I can't for the life of me figure out what this

beneficial?

What's a Harla Dar? (am I missing EVERYTHING today?)

Alright, who shoved their lunch under the zoneline 
again?

Ah-hah.  I bet there's a big line-up for questing 
characters in the Warrens today, right guys?

... guys?

Annnnnnd I read that as "Test of Testicles", which
