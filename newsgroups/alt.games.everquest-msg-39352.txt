so i've used all my practice credits, and now want to actually spend money
at the trainer in Kaladim to improve my dwarf warrior's skills.  he asks me
if i'd like to train, for example, 1-h slashing.  but i can't figure out how
to pay him...i've tried typing in yes, /yes, train, /train...none of it
works. any tips?
