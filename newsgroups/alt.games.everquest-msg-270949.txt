The other drawback to this is I saw so many groups that wouldn't allow
healers in unless they had KEI and got it refreshed every time it was
about to run out. I saw groups grind to a halt as all the mana users
ran to PoK (or Nexus before that) to get their KEI refreshed. The big
downside to this was most KEI casters were charging 50-100pp a pop for
KEI.
