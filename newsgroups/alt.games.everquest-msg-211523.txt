One handed and don't forget the huge weight advantage and process. There is
something like a Mace of Shadowed Souls for SKs that is just about as nice
and cheap. I don't know what level you can get the mace at.

Paladin can also pick up a really nice 2hs in OOT soon as they learn how to
swim or use a boat. They<and cleric> also have Shining Star Mace as soon as
they can scrape together a 3 pp which processes cure disease at any level
IIRC.

Ranger gets a Jappie Pine Crook if they are extremely lucky which isn't
exactly a whoop-ass weapon. I have seen *lot* of rangers still carrying the
pine scout<?> weapon well into the teens.

You can get the Paladin 2hs for nothing. You will have trouble beating that
price for something a ranger can use. I mean you would have to find someone
willing to pay you to take a weapon off their hands.

I was more refering to drops from mobs or quests that you can do under level
30. In my experience they are pretty crappy to middle of the road. Things
like WotFS, SSY.

The context of this thread was tanking. In my experience my ranger tanks
better in a group with a shield then dual wielding. It isn't a mute point,
it is the point.
