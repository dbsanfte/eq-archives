Time for you to do some serious rereading.  Starship Troopers.  When
Johnny's in OCS.

The two are unrelated, to me.  It's quite possible to be a chronic heroin
user and still have higher social responsibility.  What's needed is to
provide the impetus for growth of such responsibility early in the person.
A homeless drunkard who cares for a lost child has far more social
responsibility than a yuppie who looks away from an unconscious person on
the sidewalk.

Teach them to fish first, then let them have their drugs if they want them.
