Aye, and as you know, I've solo'd plenty with my Shaman, too. But there's an
*awful lot* of gameplay in EverQuest and the question isn't whether it's
possible to solo, the question is how much soloing is going on relative to
grouping. My observation has always been that the >>vast<< majority of
gameplay underway is by players grouped together, not individuals soloing.
The number may not be 95%, I don't know. But that's where I pegged it based
on my gut reaction to what I've seen. If you've got a different number,
chirp up, that's why I asked. ;-)
