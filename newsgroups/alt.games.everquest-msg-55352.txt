Not sure about level 30.  Warsliks Woods and Dagnors Cauldron would be mostly
green by then I'd think, except  for occasional named Mobs and such.  Emerald
Jungle would be too high level for 30.  You could try the graveyard in
Mistmoore.  Try camping pairs at the graves.  Dalnir may be tricky.  As has been
mentioned it is chaotic.  Ive never hunted the Kly or Coerced there so I can't
truly speak of much beyond the first few rooms/caves into the dungeon.  Timorous
Deep may be ok, just check a map and find an island with the appropriate level
creatures.  Level 30 may be an 'in-between' level for the zone though (too high
for some and too low for the rest of the creatures).

If I recall correctly, I spent level 30 hunting the undead sprite horrors and
guardians in Lesser Faydark.  As a druid in wolf form I didn't have to worry
about the brownie scouts that seem to keep most other players from hunting
there. Of course that was a temporary GM event, so I can't recommend that now ).
