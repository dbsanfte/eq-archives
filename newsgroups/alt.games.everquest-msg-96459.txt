Take the boat from the N Ro docks and it will go to a little island, run
across the little island and a bigger boat will show up to take you to
Iceclad in velious. Iceclad is the lowest level zone in velious but would
still be suicide for a lv 17 if you got attacked by anything.
But since you have sow and invis, you could possibly survive the journey
across iceclad. Bind yourself on the docks, it's pretty safe there, unless
someone is pulling to the docks.
