If past expansions are a valid indicator then I'd say 4hrs Monday nite
(within 2 hours of current patch), 6hrs Tues morning, 2hrs Wed Afternoon,
7hrs Fri morning and an additional 4hrs next week sometime...  add to that
the additional 3hrs on the "estimated" 7hr original patch and my guess is 26
hours of down time for this expansion.
