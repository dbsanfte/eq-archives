Hmm...nope...try as I might, I can't think of any service I have been
paying for over a span of four years that hasn't had a price increase.
Normally, that price increase is way more than $3/mo., too. Surely,
you get way more than $13 worth of entertainment out of the game.
That's only like, what, four movie rentals (three more likely)? That
would be about six to eight (4.5 to 6) hours? Don't know about you,
but I play WAY more than that (whether THAT is good or bad... :).

Ya know it's worth it.
