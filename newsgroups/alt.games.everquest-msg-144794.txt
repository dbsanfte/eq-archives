Sure it has a few bugs, but the Nexus system is a wonderful addition to the
game.  Before I got the Luclin expansion I spent a lot of time running
(unsowed) from place to place or begging a gate. You will hear no complaints
from me (well maybe a few-I really hate the shared pads) because the Nexus
has been a godsend to the KOS races and classes.  My necro did get killed
one time while waiting for a gate up at the NK spires.  Now I keep her bound
in SH and only use the spires to gate down.  It just takes a few seconds to
get out of range if Gather Shadows starts to wear off.

So, be Glad-not Sad, the spires are your friend :)
