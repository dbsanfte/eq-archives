I'm still learning the ins and outs of Everquest. I've hit the wall a few
times and got so frustrated that I've thought about dropping it but then
I'll have a very positive experience that will pull me back in. I was hoping
I could get some help with some of these questions.

One thing that I've been wondering about and having problems with is
information on spells and items. Is there any way of finding out (in game)
what a spell does? I right click on a spell in the trade window and it tells
me if I can use it, what skill or spell school it uses, what lvl I need to
be to use it, and how much mana it uses. It doesn't say anything about what
the spell does. Is there a way I can see what it's effects are? Some are
obvious, like summon water and that sort of thing but I'd like some detail
on some of the others. Also, I have a similar problem with magic items.
Certain weapons and armor say they are magic when you right click on them
but they don't tell you what the magic effect is. Does it say this somewhere
in the game?

One of my biggest problems has been with grouping. I find some people I
enjoy grouping with but then I might not play for a couple of days. When I
come back, everyone that I played with has leveled up too far ahead of me to
with anymore. This has been the most discouraging thing in the game. What's
the best thing to do in this situation? Should I just look for other people
to group with and move on? Should I try to solo for a bit and level up?

One of my other questions/problems is about soloing.  I seem to have
problems finding places to solo at my current level. I'm a level 14
barbarian beastlord. I can't seem to find anything I can fight on my own and
still get experience for. When I finally find something to fight that
doesn't con green, it usually cons red. I'm stuck in this sort of limbo.
Where is a good place to go solo at this stage?

Okay, last question/gripe for now. How in the world are you supposed to find
your way around without a map? I get lost so often, even in areas I'm pretty
familiar with. It still burns me that I have to buy LoY if I want to be able
to use a map in game. Every other RPG I've played has had an auto-map
feature built in. The game world in Everquest is huge but I'm hesitant to go
adventuring and explore it because I get lost so easy and if I get killed, I
have to find my body again. The only times I've been away from the areas
surrounding Halas is when I've been with someone that has LoY and knows
where they're going. This is another thing that has really frustrated me and
kept me from enjoying the game. Any suggestions here? Yeah, I could buy LoY
but I just spent $50 on Everquest Gold and I'm shelling out about $13 a
month to play. I'd rather not cough up even more money to Sony so soon.

I'd appreciate any and all help with these questions. TIA.
