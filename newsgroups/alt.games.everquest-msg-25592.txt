Sorry to disagree here Markus, but Armor actually becomes MORE important
as you
raise in level. When your tank is at 2 bubs and taking 90point hits or
your 
enchanter has managed to attract the attention of everything on the 3rd
floor 
in Befallen, you will definatly not want to be telling them "sorry you
died, I
kept getting interupted from being hit". Becasue of this, every point of
AC is 
essential as a cleric. The higher the AC, the less often you get hit.
You _will_
build agro, you _will_ get swung at, there is no way around this,
regardless of 
the group.

Actually at his level +wis is less efective than +mana. Unless he is
wanting to
tradeskill, mana is a better stat to chase for <20. A single moonstone
ring 
would probably keep him at his cap for some time to come.

These are both entirely true.

This is also good advice. For a 1hb I highly recommend heading to Odus
and 
fighting the Muglwump in the warrens at 18 or so. It's a great mob for
that
level and drops a great 1hb +WIS Stein.
