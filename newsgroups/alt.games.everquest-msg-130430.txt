another burning question I have is: I have zonealarm block internet
servers, and have denied all of the eq-apps permission to set up an
internet server.

Everything seems to work fine!

am I missing anything?  some feature I'm loosing out on?  Am I causing
any headaches for the people that run everquest?  Does the fact that I
get many UDP requests blocked vs. my wife's lack of them (no requests)
mean that I might have a virus that infected the everquest .exe's ???

I dunno, it just smells funny.

> Thanks in advance for any wisdom you could share.
