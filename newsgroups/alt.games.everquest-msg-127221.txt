Because, if He does not give everyone a chance to excersise free will, than
is it truely free?  He gave us all the chance, knowing that some of us would
abuse it.  I'm not sure what you guys think "free will" is, but it seems we
won't agree on it.  What you're complaining about now, seems to me, is that
God gave you the freedom to choose your own course.  Is there anything that
will satisfy you?
