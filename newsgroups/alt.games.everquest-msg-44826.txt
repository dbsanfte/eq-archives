Hi everyone!  I currently have a 25th level monk and until now I've been
wielding 2 Cane of The Tranquil.  I was recently told that I needed to drop
the canes until around level 40 and wield 2 Fighting Batons.  I know the
fighting batons have a smaller damage ratio, can anyone explain to me the
reasoning behind this?  Also, how do you determine weapons to use in the
primary slot and which weapons do better in the offhand?  I have heard
several people comment on this but I don't fully understand.  Any help is
appreciated.


Thanks
