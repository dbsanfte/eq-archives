But if I wanted to give my fish the freedom to choose between good and 
evil, to make them in my own image, to make them sentient, then I would 
go into it expecting that not every fish is going to turn out the same.

My deific creative hand is merely stirring the fish-pot at this point 
not assembling fish an atom at a time. I have created the potential for 
all manner of fish of all dispositions, but I dont dictate just how each 
individual fish is going to turn out, I leave that up to the fish. That 
is my gift to them.

Agreed.

Nothing wrong with that belief, but it isn't illogical or irrational or 
inconsistent to believe just in the yin, at least in this case.
