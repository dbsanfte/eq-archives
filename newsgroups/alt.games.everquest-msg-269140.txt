Yeah, I agree.  It was at worst just one more thing to deal with, rather 
than something that kept you constantly PO'd.

And Diablo 2 doesn't do that badly either, although in that game the rate of 
decay is so slow for most items that it might as well not even be part of 
the game.

But UU probably had it closer to "right" than any with which I'm familiar.
