I would like the AGE crew to please be aware of a problem on the
Morell Thule server, and please tell us how other servers have delt
with this. We are frustrated here, and wonder how we can really do
something different. Some people are cancelling accounts, and going to
other games. I think that people out there knowing about this, and
perhaps relaying a strategy that worked on other servers, would help
us get some order back on our own server.

I fear this has killed this server as a nice place to be.

A person on the MT server has bought and paid for at least 11
accounts, that he multi-boxes, off playerauctions. This person has
admitted this outright, and has admitted this in front of a guide and
a GM. What happened? Nothing. They had no comment on his purchase of
"ebayed' accounts. What is worse is they actually gave him back an
account, after he admitted he bought it.

How did he get it back? He trained BoT every night to terrorize the
server until Sony gave him his account back. It is inexplicable.

I kid you not, he has a guild that consisted of him and him alone. He
playes them all at the same time and has even passed some PoJ trials.

A week ago, during a ring war, this guy killed the turn in mobs,
turned around and killed them again. He has been griefing like this
regularly. He was banned.

A lot of us made phone calls and wrote emails. We got a lot of noise
from the Sony CS people. The server population thought that something
was going to happen. We then got a big disappointment. They took him
out of ban, and stated that they think he did nothing wrong.

We suspect that he has an inside person at Sony. We worry that they
system of CS they have in please is corrupt or if not corrupt, just
unable/unwilling to do something about this griefer.

Finally a collector of his antics, with Sony's totally ball-less
response:

Some have taken out vigilante justice. I dont like it, but people are
canceling accounts, those who cancel or are about to have no reason to
"play nice". Some are thinking that Sony will not do anything, so are
taking matters into their own hands.

This is well known at Sony, here is a link to the board detailing the
incidents.

There are a lot more links here on Sony's board, I am going to list
them in case that article "disappears". If you are interested please
