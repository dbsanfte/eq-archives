A long time ago, I was marveling at the gear being worn and wielded
by someone in Crushbone.  I asked him his secret for affording such
great gear.

He told me the secret is to do everything you can to fake newbieness,
and to hang out near a bank, asking for a rusty weapon.  When someone
asks why, tell them you lost all your gear on a corpse that rotted.
