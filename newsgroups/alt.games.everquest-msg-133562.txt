1) Pet damage is weighed against damage from your entire
group, its almost never an issue when you aren't soloing, as
each pet would have to outdamage all of your group in order
to steal exp.
2) Since they changed things, your group now has to do
one single point of damage to "outdamage" your pet.  One.
Hopefully your monk friend can manage to do one point
before your pet steals the exp
