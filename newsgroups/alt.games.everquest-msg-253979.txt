No, it's not like showeq. It is a view from far above the dungeon. Most

You can achieve this by using the tool from
http://www.eqzoneviewer.com/ . It only works offline so you won't have
any spawns in there.
ShowEQ Maps look like the maps rendered here:
http://www.tski.co.jp/baldio/map . Just with added spawns.
