If it's too much trouble to bank in Paineel, then maybe I should forget
about that?
What about this idea instead?
* Gate back to the druid ring in Tox.
* Use invis to get through Erudin.
* Take the boat to Qeynos.
* If needed, jump into the water upon zoning, cast invis, then travel to the
bank.
* Use the bank in Qeynos, and reverse the process to get back.

Or...

/auction WTS 1400 copper pieces & 360 silver pieces, make an offer.

Maybe...

/auction Need help trading coin. Will give you 20% more than what you give
me (5 gold for 6 gold worth of coin).

Someone will end up with nearly 15 gold by the time it's over with.  Now
there is some nice cash for a newbie, just by helping me bank.  Also I'm
getting low on food, and the nearest merchants I know of I can by from are
Bubar in EC tunnel, and Neriak, which anyone who knows their Norathian
geography knows that is not a practical method.  How about buying a 2.5 gp
stack of food or drink for 4 gold, or 1pp for a stack of each (that's DOUBLE
your money instantly).  Nice newbie quest there?  No faction or EXP, but
decent coin reward (now the catch is that 1pp is going to be
copper...weighing 25 units).
