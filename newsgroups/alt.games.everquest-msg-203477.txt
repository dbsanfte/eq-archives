On Saryrn things have not changed much.  People still kei 'for donations'
and I have had no trouble finding it.  I have never yet bought from someone
who sets his price above my normal donation (40p), but I would if I was in a
hurry.  There was one guy casting kei and exhorting people to 'petition' if
they don't like the change.  When I ran him down there was a gm or guide
talking to him, but I don't think he got in trouble cause the next day his
shout message was still the same.  As far as harassment goes, the chanter
should just put the person on ignore.  Life is too short to put up with
fools.
