Use /cast # in your macro, where # is the number of the spell you
want to cast (from top to bottom) in your spell gems box.

For example, if Complete Healing is the spell at the top position:

/sit off
/gsay Complete Heal for %t in 10 seconds
/cast 1

That macro makes sure you're not sitting, announces the heal to the
group, and casts whatever spell is in the first position.
