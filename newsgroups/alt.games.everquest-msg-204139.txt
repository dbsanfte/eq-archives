See, this is part of my devious plot...if I'm ona PoH raida nd one drops,
I can graciouly pass on the roll to another ranger, and so then folks will
be so awed by my generosity they'll let me loot a really uber 2hb. :P

or something like that...

dang, I just told my secret.

Actually, I was going to offer that as part of my explanation *laugh*,
because I couldn't come up with anything better.  

That's one of the joyful things I'm learning in old age...that it's ok to
embrace illogic, if it makes you happy.

yeah, I decided not to...mostly because it's not reliable enough.  It's
just a toy, and right now...well, too many better Aas to choose from.

ND is a given no matter what, as is combat avoidance (not necessarily as
tank, just to help out healers so they have less to worry about when there
is a MT)...I hear combat stability isn't quite as hot for rangers though
as avoidance, for some reason, though.

but yes, having my own shaman explains a lot about my approach to the
ranger class. :)

I'm tempted to change my sig to say "58 ranger and shaman pet"

Oh..*sigh*...I dunno. Maybe I jsut got unlucky that one time, but the
threads on the glade are full of horror stories.  Maybe folks only post
the horrific stuff...wouldn't be the first time.

*grin* I'll only hurt you if you get between me and Stormy right now.
