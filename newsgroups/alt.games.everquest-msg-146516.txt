Unfortunately, with the change to "pooled" GMs you are much less likely
to see a GM online than previously.  Your best bet is probably to
continue sending petitions, and to use the new /viewpetition (sombody
correct that if I got the command wrong) to make sure your petition
is there in the queue, resubmit if it disappears without you being
contacted.  One cautionary note, however much you may feel that you're
being treated poorly in this matter, if you communicate that feeling
in terms along the lines of "I'm the customer, I'm spending $$$, I'm
paying your salary..." followed by demands for immediate service, the
most likely result is that you anger the CS rep, which is not
particularly likely to help your cause.  If your opening gambit is to
convince the GM that you're just another asshole he's not likely to
put himself out very far to help you out.  Keep in mind that, no matter
how frustrated you may feel, the first impression this GM has of you
is your petition, followed by whatever you say when you are contacted.
It is possible to communicate your frustration without being an ass,
and doing so successfully often gets you better service than otherwise.
(I'm not suggesting that you're an ass, but I've seen an awful lot of
nice people manage to convince strangers that they're complete jerks
when they're frustrated about something.)
