My wife's druid is having a problem with the LDoN adventure merchants.
She has full or almost full points in all the LDoN camps (around 1500)
but can't see items past about 1150.  

We've checked the following:

1) Points in camp: Like I said, she has plenty.  We know that you have
to have points in the camp where you are buying.  That isn't the
problem.

2) Custom UI: she's tried on 3 different comps, including mine, which
has never had a custom UI, and which works fine for my chanter.  Same
results.  So clearly a server-side problem.

3) Available items: she tried clicking off the "show me only items I
can use", still no items past 1150.  Also checked with other druids,
who can see items.

We've tried contacting SoE tech support but so far haven't found
someone who actually reads the message we send (e.g. we send a
detailed message and get back a "what's your problem?").

Anyone else run into this problem or have any other ideas on things to
try?
