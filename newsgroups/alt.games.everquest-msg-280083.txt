> Do you ever raid?  If you don't raid, MGB is fairly pointless.

I definitely think that's a matter of opinion.  I played a Beastlord in
a family guild, and we very rarely raided, once every other week or so
for epics, pretty much.  I think I only used MGB for that purpose 3 or
4 times, since I didn't use it for buffing, but kept it handy in case
an emergency Paragon was needed.

But I knew that when I bought the AA.  That wasn't my main purpose in
buying it, although it was certainly one of them.  (And there are
always open raids that the OP might want to join where it could be the
difference between being invited or being left behind.)  I bought it
because, dammit, it's fun to MGB buffs in PoK.  And with 50% buff
extension through items, people actually wanted my Spiritual Dominion
buff, or if another Beastlord was doing that, Spiritual Vigor.  As a
Druid, you shouldn't underestimate how much certain classes want your
Blessing of the Nine buffs.  There were several occasions, especially
after the spell components were removed, when one cleric would MGB
Virtue and another would MGB Symbol with a Druid's PoT9.  Personally, I
enjoyed 9 more than Virtue when simplying grinding for experience, or
in a group where I wasn't tanking.

If you're in a guild that raids, or looking to join one, MGB is pretty
much required (especially with Remove Greater Curse or other AAs that
Druids get).  But if you're not...my suggestion is to not just look at
the utility of an AA, but also the fun factor.  It is a game, after
all.

(As for Dire Charm, it doesn't seem to get used much in groups past
PoP, from what I have seen.  It could be fun for soloing, but I don't
have any experience with that so I can't help you there.)

Game on,

The Oneiromancer
