}>That's misleading - there is no percentage exp modifier for zones.
}"Percentage" is just a form of saying the same thing. The numbers and
}formula look different, but it ends up in the same place.
}So yes, its quite all right to say zones have a percentage exp
}modifier. There's a base most zones use; 75 if I remember correctly
}for the raw number. Zones with a different number can have it
}expressed as a percentage thereof. Say Kurns with a whopping 150 raw
}would be a 100% percent zone bonus (or again in a different way, 200%
}of base mob exp) - mobs killed there are worth twice as much as a mob
}in North Karana.

This is true...  However, pretty much any site you see on the web (eg, 
alla's, eqatlas) that expresses zone exp bonus as a percentage has wildly 
inaccurate numbers, usually based on that one patch message when they said 
how much they were -increasing- certain ZEMs by.  That would be this patch 
message, here, from Jan 14, 2001:

http://www.angelfire.com/rpg/whitewind/gtxt/guides/eqchanges.htm

And similarly, pretty much any site that has it expressed as a whole 
number in the 65-160 range is quoting hackersquest ultimately, and 
actually got it right.

Note that the group bonuses mentioned in that patch message are also way 
out of date. :)
