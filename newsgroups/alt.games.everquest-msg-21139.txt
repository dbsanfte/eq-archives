As a druid, you have many other options. When I was farming HPH for faction, I
stuck around a group that was taking regular pulls and casting damage shields on
anyone who was getting hit. I give damage (and earn faction) but no where near
enough to KS anyone. At the same time, the tanks are better able to withstand
the attacks because of the shield's added defense buff. (I expect wizards
casting damage shields are in the same win/win situation.) Healer types who do
healing on people who do damage will also gain faction adjustments; I have yet
to hear anyone complain about THAT! As a courtesy, though, tell the group in
advance, and announce your targets when you cast to help group members put their
mana to better use. The best advantage is that you can work with groups
substantially above/below you.
