Hello I am planning on buying the eq trilogy pack Thursday, and I wanted to
know what you guys thought of my race/class selection and how I should
upgrade to the next expansions when I need to. Vie decided to be a
Gnome/shadow and I wanted to know the fastest way for me to gain levels and
up. And like I said before I am buying the trilogy pack and was unsure of
what to install first or when to install the other 2 games.

Thanks Dean
