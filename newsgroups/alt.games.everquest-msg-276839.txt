The french and uk guys seem to want it (the few french that are left,
with Sebilis (the french UBI server) beeing nearly dead).
Half of the germans want the merge, the other half talks about
quitting in case of a merger.

UBI says no merge is going to happen and they want to attract new
people (but i guess nobody of them knows how).

Sebilis and Kael Drakkal (german server) still don�t have DoN or the
fabled mobs, the latest patch announced before easter didn�t take
place, no comment why. Now patching is scheduled for tommorow, but it
seems it still won�t bring DoN to the french and german UBI servers.

UBI won�t let characters move back to the SOE servers, as usual they
don�t tell you why, they just tell you it�s not going to happen.

Lots of people are leaving, some guilds are in trouble losing their
ability for proper raiding.

UBI don�t seem to do anything and won�t give details, SOE just says
"Ask UBI, we don�t have anything to do with the UBI servers and can�t
help you".
But people look on their credit card bills and see SOE listed.

The people on the UBI servers are pissed off, because of the situation
on their servers and UBI and SOE not doing anything to help them.

If nothing is done about the situation i guess it will be all over for
the UBI servers before the end of the year.


Enjoy your mergers, while UBI waits until it�s too late,

Andr�
