Just as a FYI, that pathing bug is on the first 3 floors of the tower.  1st
floor entrance (as you saw).  On the 2nd floor, if you fear close to the
mirror to 3rd floor, they will run into the mirror.  On the 3rd they will
run into the mirror to 4th and occasional make a small loop.

A necro and myself could pull on the 3rd floor using this method, and at the
time I didn't think anything of it.  I just considered it fear-kiting.
Necro dotted and sent the pet, I feared and healed.

I'm still not sure if I'd consider it an exploit, as we were using a valid
tactic (fear kite), we just new where the mob would run.
