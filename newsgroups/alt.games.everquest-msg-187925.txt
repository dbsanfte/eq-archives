    Well, there are also Expectations. If people expect something of you,
and you know they do, but you have no intention of meeting their
expectation, it's best to let them know before they need whatever it is
done, don't you think? I think, in a group, clerics would be expected to rez
anyone who falls in battle.

    I've yet to run into a situation where a cleric refuses to rez for his
group without a donation or such, and considering most of the time when I
die in a group it's because either the cleric's mis-timed a cheal (very
rare) or because I've quite deliberately taunted more mobs off the cleric
than I can handle, say for instance after a bad pull and a round of
desperate heals. That said it's my opinion that tanks are obligated to make
damn sure they die before any casters do, and that's something I try to live
(die) up to in game. That obligation, which I feel is quite appropriate,
being that tanking is our job, and that the very nature of tanking is
placing your own body and life between harm and others, is the main reason I
have so little patience for casters bitching and whining about being
expected to rez, or buff, or bring components for their own spells...

Regards,
James
