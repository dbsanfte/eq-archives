you can add to them after you download them, having them off eq-toolbox 
is far better than try to make them on your own, hours of work just for 
one map is just too much for me, I tried that when LoY first came out, 
I'm not gonna do that.  The eq-toolbox maps have details like succor 
points already marked.  I for one forget all about getting that until I 
need it, then I'm scared to cast it sometimes because I don't know where 
it's going.
