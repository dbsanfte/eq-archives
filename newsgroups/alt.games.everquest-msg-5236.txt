There are brass knuckles of a sort (That's what knuckle dusters actually
irl) but they are huge spiked things and come under 1hb, go figure.

I'd suggest training 1hb and 2hb anyway. 2hb, get a  Bamboo Bo Staff same
stats as a fighting baton meaning it's incredibly fast and your skill will
fly up (they also go for under 100pp) and the fighting baton is falling in
price so may be an option for you at a lower level than you think.

Your monk as everyone has said can get by fine with fists, many monks are
made as alt's and are twinked so at 10th level wielding a fighting baton and
EoD you're gonna be more effective, this is prolly why you see so many monks
with weapons at the lower levels, plenty of primary characters have got
there via your route with out help.
