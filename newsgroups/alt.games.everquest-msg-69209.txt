/agree
But for some purposes, I'm still thinking of turning my texturing down
to medium. Some of the new textures, particularly in the old world, are
*Too* realistinc, complex, and intense. The place I noticed this the
most was on haunted isle in OoT. My necro was hunting gargs there this
weekend, and since the gargs are a stony shade of grey, and the island
is made out of grey stone.... well, previously the outline of the gargs
was easy to see. Now they blend in so well that twice I wound up
fighting two of them when I pulled a distant one right over the top of
one twenty feet away that I didn't see.

Of course, my colorblindness probably plays a factor in that as well,
but I'm thinking I'm going to try medium textures tonight and see if it
smoothes out a bit.
