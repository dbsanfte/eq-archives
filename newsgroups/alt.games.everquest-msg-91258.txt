Before Kunark the line was all would be well if you installed the current
version of directX, and when Kunark came out they announced with great
fanfare that they were at last up grading EQ to use the latest version of
directX.  From that point on almost anything any customer service
representative has said about  game problems stemming from non-verant
sources has been suspect.  To make matters even more laughable before SOL
Verant stated clearly that people with intell 800 motherboards should be
able to run SOL that that board its build in video card and sound card and
512 meg of RAM memory.  I took their advice bought the RAM and then bought
two more video cards before I found one that would run SOL.  In the process
I lost all sound on my computer and soon will rebuild my entire system.  In
short if you believe what Verant customer or technical service says without
checking it first you deserver what you get.  The final joke is when I
looked up the specs of the intell 800 line of motherboards I discovered they
were designed for no more than 256 meg or RAM and a celeron processor when
verant suggest we use a PIII.
