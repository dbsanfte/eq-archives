Ah, now it's easier than ever to level up a melee twink, with BoG castable
on any level and gear more easily transferred from your high-level toon to
your low-level one.  And it's harder than ever to get a caster toon up, with
the simplest form of mana regen blown out the window.  And to top it all
off, they're going to boost the melee damage output.

That's what I call balancing.  Yeah, brothah!  Reminds me why my 64 wizard
and 62 chanter sit idle between guild raids while I work on the 52 paladin.
