Are you planning on upgrading your system otherwise?  If not, I'd stick 
with something like a GeForce2 MX-400 with 64MB of memory.  If you do plan 
on upgrading your system otherwise (processor, memory, motherboard), then 
get the best video card you can comfortably afford.  One thing to keep in 
mind though, does you current system have an AGP video slot?  If not, then 
do not spend money on a new video card if your current one runs everquest, 
as you will not really want to move that PCI video card to a new system 
someday.
