Since its in The Vision(tm) to go to 65 now, how about making 51+ mobs
only summon if they are perma-rooted or raid level encounters? Lets face
it, at lvl 60+ everything worth killing is going to summon you. This
problem is exacerbated with the recent changes in xp. I'm definitly not
advocating making really high level encounters like Vindicator, or
Dragons, etc. non-summoning. Things like Guardian Wurms and Ancient
Wyvern in Skyfire, higher level Giants in Kael, higher level mobs in
Karnors, non-named roamers in West Wastes and other things that are not
anything but xp encounters shouldn't summon. Nothing makes less sense
than having 4-5 wizards going in to business wasting Kunark dragons,
Venril Sathir, and the like which are meant to be raid level encounters.
It's terribly unbalancing and its just that sort of thing I am not for.
