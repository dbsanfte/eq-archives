Just duel a friend.

My monk did his repantant quest (destroyed the bracer right away, then 
wanted to do shackle quests) a LOT easier when duelling a druid that he 
couldnt hit (monk level 25, druid level 50), than killing green mobs 
(stupid warhammer had REALLY sucky stats, and weight too much, so take a 
LOT of time to get procs on mobs, while you take dmg. Lot easier to have 
a druid you cant hit, you dont take dmg, you can get zing when needed).
