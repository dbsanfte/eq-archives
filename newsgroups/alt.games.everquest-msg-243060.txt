No, you are not.

I earn 500 points in Miragul.
I earn 500 points in Mistmoore.
I spend 1000 points on two items in Mistmoore.
I earn 500 points in Guk.
I spend 500 points in Miragul.

All of my Miragul earned points were spent in Mistmoore.  My Guk earned 
points were spent in Miragul.  You are unlocking the camp by earning the 
points.  You never have to spend any points there, the items are still 
unlocked and available to you at any time in the future, even if you 
never earn any more points at that camp.
