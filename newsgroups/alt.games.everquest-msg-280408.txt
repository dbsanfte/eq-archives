The actual melee damage is pretty well meaningless, it's your procs that 
help a lot as far as damage done.  The highest melee crit I have seen was 
132 or so for me, using a hammer of the ironfrost, before I got my epic 
1.5.

Generally, I only melee when I am soloing, and I feel like smacking 
things, as it is far less efficient than medding, but, it is fun.  In 
groups, I will only melee if we are doing fairly trivial content, as my 
DPS is much higher if I med and use my mana for doing damage instead.
