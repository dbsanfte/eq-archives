 Now...take all this with a grain of salt, but this is what I understand.
The maps are part of the skin, and aren't loaded until you click on the tab.
Also, the maps are very small...all the maps for Antonica total 700k, Kunark
totals 400k, etc. I don't get any 'blackscreen' after the splash screen...or
at least not enough of one that I notice it. I do get a short burst of lag
(real minor, less than what I get when I take a screenshot) when I click on
a tab for a continent (which is why I think that the map images aren't
"called" into memory until you hit the tab)
 Bottom line, give it a try, it works well and doesn't violate the EULA any
more than any other player made skin (which all technically violate the
EULA, but I'm betting they'll add a clause to exclude the default UI as
software that can't be modified by the user).
