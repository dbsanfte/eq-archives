Max is 30 bubbles (1.5 levels) and acrues in 6 days.  This applies only
to mob kills as well.  Very nice for me - I haven't been actually playing
much recently, but writing Lua/XML - and testing it in the inn  :)  I
have almost a level of rest bonus saved up.

This, by the way, is great for alts :)
