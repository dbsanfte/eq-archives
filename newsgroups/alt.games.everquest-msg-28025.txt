Ok I'm a newbie only 5.5 days old but I'm proud to be level 15 (16 if isn't
for them @#@$ brownie scouts in Lesser Faydark) When would be a good time to
start the Trueshot bow quest? Also I just bought a Velium battle Axe and
when in battle it says, I  don't have the will to command this weapon,  What
does this mean?  I think it has to due with my strength(only 90) but unsure
can you all help?

Thanks,
