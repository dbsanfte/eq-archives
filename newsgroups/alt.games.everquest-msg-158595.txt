This is good advice.  I went from level 32 - almost mid 40's in the OT, and
got in several pickup groups.

1) Advantages:

2) Excellent range of monsters.

3) Outdoor zone, all your spells will work

4) Many mobs are "animals" and as such your terrorize animal and charm
animal spells will work on them.  I used to fear kite Rhinos and Sabertooths
when I couldn't get a group.

5) Lots of players, many of them grouping and willing to take on a Druid.

6) When you're solidly in the mid 30's, there's an excellent hunting spot on
the south wall, with the highest level monsters in the zone roaming around,
and a LONG valley leading out of zone.  They call it the "ledge".  You can
med high up on the valley walls if you just go back in the valley a ways to
avoid wandering monsters and goons that have been trained in.


Disadvantages:

1) Roaming Guards of a "dark" race.  These guys are TOUGH, and you are KOS.
Learn their patterns and keep away.  Watch for shouts about the "goons"
(Dragoons).

2) Remote location, takes time to get to, and you'll have to slip through
some challenging zones.  (You're a DRUID however.  Put up Lev, Invis, and
SOW, mem your travelling spells, and MAKE THE RUN!  I went in via Firiona
Vie -> Lake of Ill Omen -> Frontier Mountain -> Overthere the first time.
You should be a bit cautions in Firiona Vie, and Frontier Mountain as well.
FM especially can be confusing, you need your levitate to be able to run
quickly through, and the entrance/exit points can be difficult to spot on
those rocky walls.  Still, I did it many times, and never had a problem,
just be cautious.)

3) No port spells directly to it.  If I remember right, you'll have to
travel several zones to get there.  (I think I used the Dreadlands port spot
to get there.)  If you want to be able to leave and come back easily, you'll
have to bind there.

4) No town in-zone you can use.  The outpost is for Dark races, you'll have
to ring out, and gate back.

By all means.
