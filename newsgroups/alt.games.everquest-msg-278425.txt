i started it last nite, got a few steps in.  i was so sleepy and grouchy 
though, and the quest was SO VERY non-intuiative, i got pissed off and 
logged.
you speak to a froggie in castleview, he sends you across antonica to find 
his fellow froglock.
nowhere in the quest does it say search for clues, is says find the frog.
ok, i spent my last 6 or so months in EQ1 learining to play without the 
mouse....but in this quest you need to mouseover different items in the zone 
to get your quest updates.....not knowing this i kept tracking to the NPC 
who wouldnt speak to me.....
