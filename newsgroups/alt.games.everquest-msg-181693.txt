If you are already comfortable in DS try the Mushroom Temple instead.  Loot
isn't great, but the mushrooms they drop sell for 2-4 pp ea depending on
which kind drop.

Aviaks in South Karana drops gems that sell for 4-6pp ea or you could try
Stonebrunt.  Kobolds drop lots of weapons that sell for a few plat each, or
go for pelts and sell them in the bazaar.  Pandas also drop gems (although
somewhat rare) that sell for up to 90pp ea and claws that go for 5pp. I
think that one of the cat types also drop teeth that sell for a couple plat
ea.

You might also try Hollowshade.  I never hunted there myself but I've heard
there are some good drops and if Owlbears are up you can make good money on
Perfect Owlbear Pelts.

Auqua Goblins in LOIO are supposed to be good, never hunted them myself,
always camped when I went there. If you go there look up info on them.
There are some tricks to that camp.
