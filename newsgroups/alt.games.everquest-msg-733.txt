First off I would suggest joining a good guild, ask around and dont be
afraid to leave a guild if they arent doing anything or arent real fun.
Second, groups tend to get better the higher up you go, Clerics no when too
heal, and enchanters learn to work control crowd, ect.  but you will still
find some really bad groups and really good ones.  Its a just the luck of
the draw, however, my philosphy has always been that if the group gets me
killed more then once, I politely say good bye and start looking for another
group.  A top notch group will consist of a puller who knows how to not pull
extras, and Enchanter who knows how to deal with extras that are pulled, and
a Cleric or Shaman that wont let his partys damage go all the way down.
Also the higher you go the more people you know, if I've safely grouped with
certain individuals and no them to be friends all ask them if they have room
in there group.
