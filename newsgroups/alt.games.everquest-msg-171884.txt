It'll likely come down in a month or so, once spectrals become more
widespread and people start selling duplicates of tranquility.

Grieg would own them and Servitor does not drop KEI level spells.  (dunno if
Grieg does or not)

Quite honestly, if his average level on the raid is 54... a *lot* of these
mobs are out of reach.

These two are probably your best shot.   Rhag 1 can be done by two groups of
level 60's, so a raid of mid 50's can probably drop him.   The hardest part
of killing him is finding him alive.

Being able to kill the Va'Dyn depends completely on how good your debuffers
are.  If your shaman can get him slowed, he's a walk in the park.  No idea
what the minimum level would be to slow him.   Malo helps a great deal, but
I'm not sure if it's an absolute necessity or not.    A single group of
level 60's can kill him if they slow him easily, the fight just lasts
forever.

>  Doomshade (The Umbral Plains)
>  Rumblecrush (Umbral)

Rumblecrush does not drop spells, only Doomshade does.

I've never been around when we managed to finally catch Rhag 1 alive for a
moment, so I don't know how easy he really is.  But I still think you're
failing to take into account where he said thier raid average level was
about 54.    On any mob harder than the Va'dyn, about the only thing a sub
54 is going to bring to the raid is extra lag.   And thats half of thier
people....

The differences in power between level 60 characters and low 50's are just
massive.   I can't even really imagine trying them with a 54 warrior as main
assist.  4000 hp buffed and no defensive for another level (maybe even less
hp than that, since no aegolism or focus)  Rogues that don't have double
backstab yet, not that anyone will be hitting for much, especially on a
target 10 to 15 levels above them.  Druids and shamans don't even have
chloroblast at that level, much less incomplete heal.  Bards who can't sing
OOS or AE manasong...  the list goes on and on.   All of the things that we
take for granted.
.
Doesn't mean that they shouldn't try... especially if they can get a few
high levels for the key roles... but anything that they do will be a
challenge that several of us can't really relate to.
