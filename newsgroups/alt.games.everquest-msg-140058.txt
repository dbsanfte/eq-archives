Aye, but there are many who would be rather insulted by having their ass 
described as ample, whether it actually is or not.  Therefore, it is a 
personal attack.

Similarly, your incredible, impenetrable, cluelessness is an attribute 
(although slightly less physical), but if I comment on it, I would expect 
you to take it as a personal attack.
