    Our server has been up and down like an elevator. Always a rollback
situation, too. The lucky part is, because I need to camp out to get out of
a raid (old UI), I've always had my status saved from camping while others
lose loot, flags etc. It's gotten to the point that some people are making
/report hotkeys for when they loot items.
