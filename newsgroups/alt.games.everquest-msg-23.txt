Wakening lands is not a real spell, its a portal spell,
different category.  Wizards and druids get a -=lot=-
more new spells with the expansion than anyone else
if you count these.

Wakening lands port is one of the "trash" spells dropping
off of the guardians; drops more frequently than any
of the rest, and is only marginally better than the hybrid
drops, which can literally be storebought.

Specifically, I surmise that the 39 wizard spell, Invisibility
to undead (self only variant) is -not- dropping off the wurms.
