I just think it's silly to demand payment for such a low level attainable 
and readily available favor as a SoW. Perhaps the dick here is the one 
reading way too much into things?

Btw, since I made that post, I bumped into him at the PC zoneline on the SH 
side. He asked me if I remembered him (right, it was just earlier that same 
day) and I said I did and told him from where. I told him no hard feelings, 
but I didn't believe in requiring compensation for SoW. He must have 
accepted that, because he then invited me into his guild. All things 
considered, I politely declined.

So, if *he* didn't think I was a dick about it, maybe it's someone else.
