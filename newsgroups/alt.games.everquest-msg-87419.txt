I know lots of folks having a great time at that level in
Marus Seru.  We have a monk in our guild who has a monitor
that *REALLY* needs to be replaced - Infravision, Ultravision,
gamma settings - nothing helps him see at night.  I finally
convinced him to go to MS - It's on the day side, he's loving it.

He just hit 30.
