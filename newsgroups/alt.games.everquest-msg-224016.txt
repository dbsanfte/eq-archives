I'm seeking advice on a lot of issues I've been having with Everquest since
the last couple patches. My system is as follows:

Dell Dimension 8100/1.3G P4 768MB RAM
GeForce ti4200 Video Card 128MB RAM
40G Hard Drive about 20G free
Windows XP
DSL connection

I feel like with that configuration I should have few issues as I have
recently added the card, extra memory, and XP to help alliviate some of the
lag. I have taken all of the XP junk off that saps up memory, have installed
the latest video driver, repeatedly defragged the hard drive, and checked to
make sure heat is not an issue.

Since the last patch I now crash every time I window out of EQ. Sometimes I
crash without windowing out. I have frequent problems with lag with almost
everything turned off and sometimes just get an extended pause. This seems
to happen more when clicking on things in the bank or pulling up my trader
window.

Finally, I get an error message upon loading my custom UI (mix & match).
I've got the following modified: Animations, Container, GroupWindow,
HotButtonWnd, Inventory, PlayerWindow, TargetWindow, TrackingWnd. It seems
like my Animations file is causing the problem, it may be because I'm using
an older Player window mod called Avi-Windows.

Please let me know if you see any places here that might be causing my
problems or have any advice. Thanks.
