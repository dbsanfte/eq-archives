Fear is easy if done right, but hugely unforgiving. I used to go up
with open raids that could end up with 10 to 12 groups. We'd average
about 15 pulls an hour, 10 hours a raid, and 3 TPWs in the course of
that time. I'm amazed I ever went on another raid again. Now, we run
small, 24-person precision raids. We're in and out in four hour, clear
the bottom floor, get tons of drops, and have had 1 TPW in four raids.

There are a lot of things that make for an easier Hate raid, but
here's the biggest thing that I find makes it easier:

The strategy for Hate was set EARLY in the life of EQ--So early that
there was no 50-plus game: Break in invisible, run for the safe camp
on the wall. If you get aggro, die where you stand. Don't train the
camp. A much better solution if you have the firepower is to send the
first two groups up early to break the spawns near the port up, then
fight from there. It doesn't rely on everyone in the raid doing what
they're told, doesn't give people time to get bored, and doesn't lead
to anywhere near the number of TPWs of wall breaks.

Oh, and don't run open raids--not anywhere, not ever. But, certainly
not in Hate.
