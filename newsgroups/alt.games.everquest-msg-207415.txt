Not entirely true. The classes you mention almost always refresh their
DoTs to finish off most mobs (especially at mid-high levels). I've
played all 3 classes, and I rarely if ever finish off a mob without at
least 1 DoT still running. With the change, DoTs do more damage over
their normal non-focus extended length of time. So they will get
refreshed sooner, which means the mob still dies quicker overall. 

With the change DoTs are doing as much (possibly more?)  damage over a
shorter period of time. I don't see any way of calculating it where
this is a disadvantage over adding a tick or two to the length of time
the DoT runs.
