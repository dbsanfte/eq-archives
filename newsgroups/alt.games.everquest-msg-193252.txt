lol - sorry, was trying to take a break from the
vagaries of Visual Studio .Net (there are some 
REALLY annoying bugs in there).

Boiled down - mobs with lots of HP that hit hard
in a regular outdoor zone = bad

Mobs with low HP that don't hit so hard (particularly
in dungeons where you get more xp per kill) = good
