Yes, and I'm sure 90% of those kids are FAR worse about it than we
are. They're just words. Frankly, I think the fixation on certain
words being "evil" or whatnot is silly. Rude, yeah. Bad, evil,
whatever? No. These kids aren't going to be corrupted and turn to a
life of sin and crime because someone said "fuck" too many times in
their presence.
