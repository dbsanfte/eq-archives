This is true, in fact the idea that you can attack an arguement
by deriding the person making it is one of the classic fallacies,
"ad hominem" (to the man).

However, in this case I thought that the attack wasn't on DT's
arguement as such, but rather on his debating skills and
personality; that is to say "stop calling me a corksucker, it
won't get you dates with Irish girls" rather than "since you
called me a fargin bastich your theory that JFK was killed by a
single shooter is bunk"

I took it as an aside, hoping to make the discourse more civil; 
along the lines of saying "hey, thats out of bounds, stoppit you
bully".  Effective?  Perhaps not, DT's never been known for a
thin hide anyway.
