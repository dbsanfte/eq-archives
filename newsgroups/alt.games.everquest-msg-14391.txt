Dan, you bore me.

As for divorce court for me and My SO, Not going to happen.  My Life Partner
do something you seem to not able or care to do, that is to discuss issues
and things we do not agree upon.  And no we do not agree on everything, but
we sure as Hel, don't attack the other for having a differing opinion.
I was making a observation of people who seem to dislike the game but stay a
bitch and attack, Hmmm kinda like you are doing here.  You don't like the
observation, Oh Well. And Dan I am not going anywhere.  I enjoy my time with
EQ, and I learn some fun stuff here.
So enjoy your potshot at my marriage and at my views,  It matters naught to
me.

In the real world I solve problems,  I am a Big Brother, A Spiritual
Counseler, and Work with Battered Women and Animals. And I do tech support
for an ISP.
I leave the world a better place.

Do you?
