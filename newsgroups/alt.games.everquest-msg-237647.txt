You are confusing "faith" (i.e. "trust") with the unquestioning
acceptance of authoritarian belief systems and temporal heirarchies
derived from these beliefs.  They are not the same thing.

That is a statement of faith.

You might take a moment to notice that there isn't a nickel's worth
of difference between "organized religions" (most of those you're
thinking of anyway) and "organized nation-states" in this regard.
Heirarchal social-political organizations are this way by nature.
Even those that avoid authority-dictated group-think are subject to
being overwhelmed by populism.  Really, if you want to be certain of
avoiding giga-deaths the only viable option is anarchy (of course,
at our present population level there'd be giga-deaths involved in
achieving anrachy, guess you can't win for losing).
