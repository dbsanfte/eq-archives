I disagree.

Bad example. If my neighbor stops by and offers to jump my dead battery 
I wouldn't be the least bit offended. I would, however, be decidely 
unimpressed if things were well in hand; perhaps the battery wasn't dead 
and the car was merely parked! And my neighbor popped over and started 
trying to boost my car when my back was turned.

See the difference?

In one he -offered- to help. In the other he just started "helping".

If people only ever -offered- to help kill mobs you engaged (and 
respected your response), there would be no problems with killstealing.
