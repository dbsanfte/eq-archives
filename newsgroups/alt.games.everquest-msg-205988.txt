Ok,

So I was in LGuk many weeks ago a realized its pretty good in there at
the bottom near the AM and Lord for a 48 Cleric and 51 Warrior.  So I
fought my way in (warrior) with my brother keeping me going with his
cleric.  We parked there, and he binded the cleric in a place I
thought was pretty safe so he could go back and forth there as needed
(to rez me mostly...hehe).  Right around the corner from the AM.  He
knew I would give him ports with my DRU as necessary.  Lots of folks
camp that spot and I have never logged in there without someone being
there, solo.  Pretty safe I figured.  I just camped my warrior there.

So as with many, I dropped the warrior for a bit to work my druid.
And after a long bit of time I logged in my brothers cleric.  Well, I
was having a blast until we got overrun in Dulak...LOADING PLEASE
WAIT.  And I pop into LGuk (he still being bound there).  And
immediately get nailed by this basilisk.  Holy crap.  A greenie, but
the stuns took every time.  I had no spells up, naked, and was getting
stunned like mad.  What didn't help was that I got up from my desk
real quick on death to get a drink thinking I had time, and when I sat
back down was already near death....LOADING PLEASE WAIT.

You guessed it, I drop right where I left off, so I /quit as quickly
as I can.  Too late.  3rd death.  The basilisk was easy for the
warrior, especially since I was greatly modivated to take it out.  Had
three rezzers to do that hour...

I know I know, shouldn't have bound a cleric there.  Dumb.  ITU gets
me only so far then its train city.  But it was a good spot to hang
out.  Not anymore I guess.

Anyone care to guess why that thing is there now?

My guess its to discourage camping the AM...
