There is a hard cap of 255 up to level 60.  After level 60, your cap on your
stats goes up 5 points per level automatically.  You can also spend AA
points to raise the cap by 5 points per level at some point, I believe
starting at 61.  This allows you to get to a max of 305 on all stats if I
recall correctly.

The formula on casters realm shows 5.8 mana per wis/int point over 200, not
sure of it's accuracy.
