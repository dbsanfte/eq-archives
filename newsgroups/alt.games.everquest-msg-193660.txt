Been having lots of weird tree climbing experiences with by Druid
lately.  In wolf form I seem to climb like an NPC, unfortunately I
still fall like a PC (my Druid's only death in his last 3 levels
was to a tree).  The strangest experience I've had was clicking off
wolf form (was gonna SoW myself before gating) standing next to a
tree I was rapidly elevated to 10k fall altitude.  Fortunately I
already had Gate mem'd and so I was able to bug-out immediately
without having to learn the hard way whether sitting would cause a
fall.  Anybody else have strange experiences lately with supposedly
non-climbable terrain features?
