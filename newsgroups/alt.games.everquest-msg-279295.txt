I have just become a summoner in the game and for some reason I cannot
reach my pet window, I know that the command to view it is <Alt>p but
when I press it nothing happens, someone suggested I change the
command key and I did but even after that still nothing happened, does
anyone know what I should do?

Thanks all

Mick
