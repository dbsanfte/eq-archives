Btw your setup seems to be doing some weird things for threading.
Replies aren't being put in the proper place (ie what looks like a
reply to something is actually responding to something else).

That has to be a problem with your gateway since newsreaders thread by
references. It's no big deal, but it does lead to a bit of a mess. I
think its only affecting a couple e marr posters.
