Actually, the majority of them were pretty much,
"we can understand that sometimes there are problems which
make the system downtime longer than expected (or come
down unexpectedly), but is it too much to ask that you
give us *some* indication of what's going on and how
long it might take?  Hello??  Is this thing on???"

Most of the people posting to the Verant forums tonight
were just griping about being kept in the dark so much.
Their points were:

1.  People would be more understanding if they were told
what the hangup was.  People don't *need* to know, certainly,
but it makes them feel better, which is the whole point
of good customer relations.

2.  People would *really* like to know if it's a momentary
problem that will be solved in the next 5-20 minutes, in
which case they'll sit and wait, or whether it's a big-ass
problem which is likely to knock the system out most of the
night, in which case they'll know to go see a movie, call
off the guild raid in zone XXX, etc.  Not knowing just
leaves people hanging too much to be able to make any plans.

3.  Verant's long habit of using the Cone of Silence(tm)
starts to feel callous or even insulting after the first,
oh, year or two.  Not *everyone* at Verant HQ could have been
personally working on the problem (whatever it was), and
it would have helped immensely (PR-wise) if one of the 
non-essential employees had been tasked with going onto 
the website and putting up a "current status and ETA"
update, and keeping it updated as the situation progressed.
For bonus points, they could drop into the forums and
field a few questions.

Instead, the main feedback to customers was a forum response
from a GM simply restating the forum rules, reminding
people they can be suspended or banned for trying to
address Verant directly on the forums, and stating that
Verant is not likely to give only a warning for a first
offense.  And it was not posted in response to
an abusive thread, it was one of the milder "we'd
feel better if we had more information" threads.
The tone was distinctly, "sit down and shut
up, or else".

Ooh, baby, now there's a company that cares about the
concerns of its customers...

Sigh.

For years now, I've said that despite its many flaws,
the main problem Verant has is its tendency to
seldom miss an opportunty to apply gasoline to a
small brushfire, PR-wise.  I've lost count of the
times where they could have defused a situation
by simply saying the right thing at the right time,
only to instead create more hard feelings by
either saying nothing, or the wrong thing.

They've got a serious case of foot-in-mouth disease,
when they could be doing so much more (with so
little effort) to improve their customer relations.
It's a shame.
