Ok, I was so excited to reach level 30 with my Iksar Beastlord
(Geckool -quellious Server), I wasted no time and memorized my spells
right away (bought them at 29). I noticed a nice new addition called
Spirit Strike and read that it does like 81 dmg. I thought to myself
that this is about 3 times the dmg I deal out with my weapon, and it
should be a nice thing to have. HOWEVER, I then noticed that Spirit
Strike uses EVOCATION, a spell skill that UNTIL level 30 was not used
at all. Well, I thought I could probably practice it for 20 of my 45
points, and did just that. I then went outside the guide and thought
let me see how it works and proceeded to try and cast it on myself and
my pet. Here is how it went:

Step 1. FIZZLE, FIZZLE, FIZZLE, FIZZLE, FIZZLE, FIZZLE, FIZZLE....
Step 2. medded for about 5 minutes and went back to step 1

Repeated this twice, then went to FoB to test on animals. Same results
as above. I would say I casted this spell no less then 200 times, and
it never worked, not even once. A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT, as there are
no other spells that eat less mana that a Beastlord can try that use
evocation.

The second part of my message is regarding the way that the
Shaman/Beastlord guild layout is in East Cabilis. I have to climb a
ladder and jump accross to gain access to the third floor and get my
Pet Buff spells. FORGET IT! I spent over 2 hours trying, finally
offered a someone 20 plat to simply buy them for me. I know it is
timing of something, but is there anything else, like have the screen
face up? If anyone is starting a new Iksar on Quellious and wants a
20plat boost to get my level 39 spells for Pet let me know..lol.
