Hi All;

I'm fairly new to EQ and can't seem to understand mana regen per tick.

I've been looking for affordable Flowing Thought items. I find an item that
has almost newbie basic stats, plus FT, equals a price of 35k + plat !!!

My question.  If FT 1 gives 1 extra mana per tick, does that mean if a spell
cost 400 mana to cast, it would take 400 times 6 seconds or 2400 seconds to
get that mana back with an FT1 item???  That just doesn't seem right. If
that was the case it would take hours to get a full mana bar back and
obviously that isn't the case.  Just what is 1 unit of mana returned per
tick actually mean? Otherwise why would a FT1 item cost so darned much.

Thank you all in advance for your help.
