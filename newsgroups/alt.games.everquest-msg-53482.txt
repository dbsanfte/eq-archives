Doesn't really matter.

Raid would only help in EQ in the same way that a second hard drive
with your swap file on the OTHER ide channel from EQ would. If two
hard drives are on the same IDE thing, like slave and master, they
take turns and that is one of the main shortcomings of IDE.  

However, if you have your main drive on Ide channel one and the second
on ide channel 2 (fully seperate one) the first drive and the swap on
the second can be accessed at the same time. I noticed shorter zoning
and loading of graphics doing this because the swap and EQ loading
graphics both ran at the same time.

By the same token if you had 2 scsi drives which always run
independantly with the swap file on a second drive from EQ and your
OS, it would work just as well.

The difficulty you still have trying to do this on a seperate IDE
channel is that some cdrom drives (presumabely also  on the second IDE
channel) slow down the hard drive a bit. That would be a bonus to
having a scsi CDROM player/burner while still having 2 ide hard drives
(drives on totally seperate channels at full speed.)

There is a promise IDE card which is pretty good I guess with 4 ide
channels which can of course make doing that easier. I believe you can
still only have 2 ide hard drives connected at once but with such a
thing you can have them on seperate ide for sure and a cdrom burner
and reader both also on seperate ides.

In theory raid which would allow the swap to be split over several
drives would help more I guess but beyond a certain point would be
overkill.
