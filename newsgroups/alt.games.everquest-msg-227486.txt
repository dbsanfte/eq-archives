I don't think that's an appropriate analogy because Monopoly's rule set does
not allow players to arbitrarily buy unowned, un-mortgaged properties that
no one has landed on. That would be equivalent to allowing someone to buy a
key to a zone that no one in Norrath had ever visited. A better analogy
would be whether I could bargain with you to exchange $5 of real money for
the Reading Railroad you just landed on. The game rules very specifically
contemplate that we can negotiate transactions and I'm not aware of any
prohibitoin against outside economic force entering into the picture. If I
offer you $200 Monopoly money and $5 real cash to sweeten the deal, I may
piss you off but I don't think I've violated any rules. Someone landed on
the property and therby triggered its general availability through
negotiations. How far we take those negotiations is the issue and the real
question I'm still asking is why stop at the game's boundaries? What's the
impact to the game?

I think this is your strongest argument. The proprietors of these various
online games have the right to define the rules any way they want and it's
pretty clear that cash transactions are supported for Magic online (even
though the currency used is actually tournament tickets), but NOT for
EverQuest. But it doesn't answer the real question I'm asking, which is what
is the objection, what is the anticipated bad impact that this would have?

Nicely and dramatically put. But it's conclusory and still doesn't answer
the question. It's intuitively obvious why your chess ranking shouldn't be
influenced by your personal wealth because that's a purely competitive
enterprise. You get ranked to position yourself relative to the crowd based
on the qualilty of your play, not the amount in your wallet. EverQuest is
different. It's a game of personal and cooperative entertainment. My
character exists to enjoy his existence. I am not competing with you to see
who has the better stuff or the higher levels or whatever. It's not a race!
It makes zero difference to me that you have more stuff than I do, or that
you were able to buy more stuff than I chose to. I don't get measured in any
way relative to your material wealth. That's your choice based on how you
derive entertainment value from this game.

So, what's the negative impact?
