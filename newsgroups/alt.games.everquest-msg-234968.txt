Do you 2 have any idea of the amount of equipment that gets thrown away
because it is replaced and it cant be sold? I figure only about 5% of
equipment is droppable and thus sellable. Right now you see maybe 30 ornate
patterns for sale . Do you have any idea of the downward price pressure on
them if 600 suits of armor with equal or better stats where also for sale?

I throw away and destroy LOTS of equipment, and I know damn well for
instance that my druid destroyed a full suit of vermiculated , and full suit
of kael armor. He is just a minor twink of mine with no real value to me and
I would have sold that equipment for whatever i could have gotten if it was
droppable :p

Maybe newbies wouldnt have kael, maybe not even vermiculated for dirt cheap.
They would have some level of equipment far greater than they do now.
