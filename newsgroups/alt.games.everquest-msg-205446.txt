Yah, what he said.

Speaking of faction, does anyone else get the urge to dance in front of
once-KOS mobs that are now Ally and start chanting "You luuuuuv me.  You
want to huuuuuug me.  You want...", oh nm...just getting silly-bored here
at work and looking forward to my first ever romp in non-KOS Chardok
tonight.  (EQ has been very boring the past few nights, doing only
faction.  Hopefully I'll get from amiable to kindly tonight.)
