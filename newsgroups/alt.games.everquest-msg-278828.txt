According to a fairly recent announcment they're in the process of 
'reinstroducing fear' to the 55+ game both for players and against them, 
plus apparently the stun thing was related to the fact that when you got 
feared you turned into a level 55+ npc, and were immediately immune to 
it so it wore off after a tic. (essentially making it a long duration 
stun). So when they removed the fear cap on npcs it 'fixed' the fear bug 
on PCs too.

There was also something about having to retune a pile of encounters 
that will be unbalanced by this bug fix, as they were balanced around 
fear as "stun", not around fear as "send you halfway across the zone to 
die alone sucker!"
