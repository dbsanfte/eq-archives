  Run testeverquest.exe only if you want to play on the Test server.
Basically by running testeverquest.exe and playing on the Test server, you
are volunteering to test various features that Verant doesn't yet feel are
ready for prime time.  I wouldn't recommend playing on the Test server, at
least not for your main character.  It can be interesting to drop in from
time to time though, to see what new features Verant has brewing.
