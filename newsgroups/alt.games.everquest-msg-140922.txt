No it isn't, unless something's changed.

It's split by level.  Your share of the exp is EXP * (YourLevel /
SumOfAllLevels).

So lets say you have a level 30, a level 34, and a level 36 grouped.

30+34+36 = 100 (yes, I chose the levels to do that deliberately.)

The level 30 gets 30% of the exp, the 34 gets 34%, and the 36 gets 36%.
