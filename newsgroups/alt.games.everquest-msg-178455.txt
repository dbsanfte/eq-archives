Dominance And Submission
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

Oh yeah
It's been ten years, half my life
Just getting ready but then it was time
Warpage in the figures, radios appear
Midnight was the barrier, back in 1963

Each night, the covers were unfolded
Each night, It's Susy's turn to ride
While Charles, the one they call her brother
Covers on his eyes, murmurs in the background
It will be time...

Oh yeah
Susan and her brother, Charles the grinning boy
Put me in the backseat, and they took me for a ride
Yeah, the radio was on, can't you dig the locomotion
Kingdoms of the radio, 45 RPM
Too much revolution then...

Each night,
Each night, It's Susy's turn to ride
While Charles, the one they call her brother
Covers on his eyes, murmurs in the background
It will be time...

It's past midnight said Charles the grinning boy
And looking at me greedily, said it's 1964

In times square now, the people do the polka
Dominance....Submission...radios appear
New Year's eve, it was the final barrier
Dominance....Submission...radios appear
We took you up and put you in the back seat
Dominance....Submission...radios appear
Form year to year we looked out for the venture
Dominance....Submission...radios appear
Dominance....Submission (repeat ad nauseam)
