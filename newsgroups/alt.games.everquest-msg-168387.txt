No, cleric was never a melee class, sorry.

Primal drops like candy now.. in a few clearings your whole guild will be
fully equipped.

Its sad to think gathering primal took us 6+ months of raiding every single
2 days, and now prismatic can be gathered at a same number in 2-3 weeks :/
Anyway, you can get a primal bat sooner or later if your guild clears the
place enough.

How about the fact your increasing your guilds DPS more than you could EVER
imagine.

Increased DPS takes you upto the next tier.. allows your guild to kill
higher level mobs..  and gives them more chance of killing the mobs that
drop something for YOU.
