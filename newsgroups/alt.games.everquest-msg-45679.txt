That's not really all that bad.  Worst case there is you died and have
a fairly simple corpse recovery, in a zone that is not hard to find
clerics in, if you want to try to get a res.

Far worse is to go LD far into a raid, especially if you can't get
back on for a while and the raid finishes while you are gone.
