I sent that suggestion to them a while back, and there was no comment.
Right now, that area is one of the biggest problem areas in the game,
becuase that's where Ragefire spawns.  Ragefire is, by design, the
bottleneck for the Cleric epic, and so Verant refuses to make that a
triggered spawn, like they have for contentious parts of some other
epics.

The Cleric epic is also one of the most desirable epics in the game,
and so guilds whose Clerics are done except for getting Ragefire are
often willing to spend a lot of time camping Ragefire.

There's not a Ragefire spawn on some servers that isn't followed by
bitter disputes, often requiring GM intervention.  The players don't
like this, and Verant doesn't like it, I'd guess.

If they made the Ragefire area in Naggy's Lair a PvP area with Sullon
Zek rules for players 53+, that would go a long way toward at least
changing the problem to one that the players themselves can deal with
thenselves without requiring GM intervention.
