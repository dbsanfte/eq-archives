Heh.  You think?

Sev is a 3 day delayed spawn, same as Ragefire. (although Rage will usually
pop much sooner after a Naggy kill)  So he will spawn roughly twice a week.
From my experience, I would say that on at least one of those, the zone is
practicly guarenteed to crash. (if the zone crashes, when it comes back up Sev
will not be up, and will take 72'ish hours to spawn again).  So, Sev will die
once every 6 days on average.  Unlike Ragefire, Sev is not guarenteed to drop
his piece.  It is an uncommon (at least) load on him.  So figure you will have
to kill him twice on average.  Which means as an estimate, a warrior will get
his epic piece after 12 days of dealing with Sev.   That is at least 3, and
more likely 4 Ragefire pops, each one servicing a cleric.

Yes, the quest is "lame" compared to the easier quests.  So, lets say only
about half the warriors on the server are actually willing to do the epic.
You do have to consider as well though that warriors are one of the most
popular classes, outnumbering clerics on my server by a large margin.  I'd put
the demand much closer to even due to that.

So, roughly even (or slightly less) demand, with the "bottleneck" piece
dropping one third or one fourth as often...
