By your above statement, then He is also a conservative, since many
right-wingers are also honest Christians.  Your statement sounded nice, but
means nothing.  Nor does the status of the followers neccessarily indicate
the status of the Master.

Oh, and I'd like to know how I "viciously disparage" liberals.

> You buy into the hate speech from Limbaugh and his cronies.  And you

Ahh, back to the "ditto-head" argument.  Yes, yes, I take my marching orders
from Rush, I have no mind of my own.  Now, are you done with the trite
little flamettes?  How about this:  maybe I listen to what Rush and others
have to say, I look at the evidence, and come up with a conclusion that
differs from yours?  Again, we see the much-vaunted open-mindedness of the
liberal.

Maybe you should define your position, instead of letting Farrakhan and
Jackson speak for you.  Would I be wrong to associate them with liberals?
Would I be wrong to associate Clinton and Gore with liberals?  How about
Gephard and Daschal?  Do you claim Dan Rather or Peter Jennings?  If these
guys aren't your speakers, then who is????  I've listened to all of these
self-proclaimed liberal spokesmen, and I see little to respect.  If you're
going to keep denying these spokesmen, then point me to a liberal you wish
to speak for you, or speak for yourself, otherwise I must assume you're
playing a shell game with your representatives and your beliefs.

I don't use them, Rush doesn't use them, Liddy doesn't use them, and Hamblin
doesn't use them.  Those who give them voice, either by supporting them
financially, or by electing them use them to define the left.  Or, if your
prefer, acknowledge that I am completely correct about the segment of the
population that I am referring to, and then draw a line and show how they
are not true liberals.  Conservatives have had to do that for the past
twenty years, as the leftist politicians have tried to hang every epiteth on
our heads from fascist to racist.  Since none of them have really fit us,
eventually people have started to see through.  If you are not as I see you,
then what are you?  Can you define yourself without going on the offensive?

> If you say "greed is good" you are unChristian.  Period.  I don't

If you think greed is the only thing that drives capitalism,  then you
obviously don't understand the first thing about a market economy.  Period.
I'll support my statement when you support yours.

I very much do.  Your bitterness and lack of anything to back up your
statement has made me begin to wonder if the question would be better
directed at you.  Of course, for me to ask it would be mean-spirited (as if
that's ever bothered me), for you to ask it of me, however is simply
"education."  Damn interesting how that works.

Bullshit.  You calim above that "a political faction whose economists and
social theorists proclaim "greed is good" is, in fact, fundamentally
un-Christian."  Then try to extend that to attack capitalists by saying they
are greedy ==> unChristian.  How does my saying that capitalism is not greed
NOT have anything to do with your criticism????

While that makes a nice little blurb against global capitalism, it isn't
exactly correct.  New companies spring up and rise to success all the time.
New franchises are created, niche markets are filled.  Old companies that
cannot adjust are bought out by those who can.  When the needs of the market
are not being met, new competitors rise up to claim their place.

Even so, your decription is the foundation of monopolies and corruption,
which are the destruction of a free-market system.  They inhibit competition
which is the life blood of capitalism.
