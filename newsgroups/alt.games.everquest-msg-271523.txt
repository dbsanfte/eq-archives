This requires you to be level 21 or lower (IIRC), because the quest
item is a chest drop and you won't get those once the gnolls go grey.
You will also have to finish the quest before the gnolls go grey,
because advancing the quest requires the same quest drops that started
it, or at least that's my understanding of it.  This can of course be
worked around by creating alts or paying lower level players for the
totems, if one is really determined...
