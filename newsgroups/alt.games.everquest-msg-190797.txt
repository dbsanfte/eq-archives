    Well up until your last line there I was of the view that this was a
reasoned post with something to say.

    Being that this is the point *I* made to you when *you* gave the advice
to the level one person to go with a monk instead of a knight for his
shammy-tank duo, I'm fairly well aware of it.

    Why I'm even gracing that statement with a response I'm not entirely
sure, for in the tiny situations, including your example, where it might
approach some level of validity, its irrelevance prevails.
