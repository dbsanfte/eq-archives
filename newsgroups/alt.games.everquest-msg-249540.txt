Number lock lets you type all you want and the arrow keys to adjust
your direction are right there as you type.

They usually talked to someone in the newbie area about buying the
item for them in return for some platinum and/or buffs.

<sacasm on> A town square where muslims, feminists, rednecks, monks,
agnostics, born agains, etc all meet and are polite to one another and
trade goods just like real life. None of that fantasy stuff where the
folks in the town square live in the town and have their own agenda
that might mean stepping on the toes of those 'other' people in the
next city or country or church.  </sarcasm off>

Doesn't the above paragraph about role-playing fly in the face of your
defense of PoK as a town square?  Shouldn't the factions that are part
of the role-play be carried over a bit from the old world?  The armor
turn in quests in PoK for instance -- shouldn't the rewards be better
if you turn in the old armor to a guildmaster who should share your
old world values than if you turn in the armor to one with opposite
old world faction?  Sure, it may mean folks create level 1 characters
to do purchasing as a mechanic to get around a faction.  

I feel that forcing interaction with others, or logging on a level 1
to make purchases, keeps the character more real -- my barbarian
warrior never approached an Iksar npc to buy food, but he did pay for
food and drink from other adventurers.  In PoK, Gunthak and the LDoN
camps, those racial and religious and class hatreds are missing, and
so are the amiable and ally cons.  Even Shadow Haven required some
factioning to use all the merchants, making Luclin seem more real than
the factionless non-role-playing expansions since.
