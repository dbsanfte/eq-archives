Lets take a mob who does 10,000 damage per minute on average, unslowed.

Slow him with Tepid Deeds, he does 5000 damage per minute

Slow him with Shiftless Deeds, he does 3500 damage per minute

Slow him with Forlorn Deeds he does 3000 damage per minute

While you might think that 5% represents 1/20th less damage, in reality 
it represents 1/7th less damage.

Going from Tepid to Shiftless cost you twice as much mana and bought you 
  1/3rd% less damage, going from Shiftless to Forlorn costs only 1/8th 
more mana and buys you 1/7th less damage, its actually a -better- 
bargain than the Tepid to Shiftless deal!

In case fractions aren't your thing:

For our example above, 100 mana buys you 5000 damage (slowing versus not 
slowing): thats 50 damage per point of mana spent

100 more mana buys you 1500 damage: 15 damage per point of mana spent

25 more mana buys you 500 damage: 20 damage per point of mana spent

If enchanter mana is at a premium and healer mana isn't (and the tank 
isn't in danger of dying) its arguably a better plan to stick with Tepid 
deeds, enabling you to slow 2 mobs for what it would cost you to slow 
one with Shiftless.

But to use Shiftless instead of Forlorn will only allow you to slow 9 
mobs instead of 8.

And its rarely enchanter mana thats the bottleneck for a group, more 
often its the healer's mana that controls the pace the group can set. 
Spending the extra 25 mana per mob should translate into less healing 
needed per minute, in effect transfering some of your mana to the 
healer, who probably needs it more than you do.

ps: I can't find the flaw in my logic above, but applying it to overall 
mana expenditure, I get 50 damage saved per mana spent for Tepid Deeds, 
32.5 damage saved per mana spent for Shiftless Deeds, and 31.111... 
damage saved per mana spent for Forlorn Deeds.

Since the extra 25 mana spent on Forlorn is more mana efficient than the 
extra 100 mana spent on Shiftless was, why isn't that "savings" slighly 
higher than 32.5, instead of slightly lower?
