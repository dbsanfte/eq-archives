> It's just a computer game and one I believe you have already purchased.

I have AC but I bought it overa year ago and played it about three minths
and got bored.  I was just wondering if I should go with EQ instead. I am in
the mood to get back into online gaming.


> I pity the person that goes shopping for shoes with you.


Naaah. I buy Nike shoes. Have since I was 14.   I cannot change now. I have
been wearing Nike for almost 13 years..
