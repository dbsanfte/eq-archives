I was having the problem and found something that makes it lots better.
When I go into a laggy zone I change from 800x600 to 640x480 and accept
those changes then immediatley change back to 800X600 and it works fine...
I just ahve to remember to change it each time I zone.  I do not have a
monster machine..  1.2 GhZ Athlon, 512 ram and 32mb geforce2...  This works
well for me and a couple people I suggested it to...  Give it a try...
