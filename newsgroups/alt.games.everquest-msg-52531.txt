It would be impossible for a level 7 character in an exp group
to kill any mob that drops a velium sword.  The highest level
person he could group with and get exp would be 12th, and
there is no way that a group of 5 12s and a 7 is going to take
down a level 25+ mob, particularly not a Velious mob.  No
spells will stick, noone will be able to do appreciable damage,
and the mob will be dishing out enough damage to kill
your best (untwinked) tank in five rounds or less.

If not for your ethics, I'd advise keeping the weapon, as
it has the same damage ratio as a Fine Steel sword, but
will hit certain creatures that can only be hit by magic
weapons.... such as the Will-o-wisp that tends to become
a very hot target around 10th level for most people.

They sell (retail) for about 5pp, if you are capable of
accumulating that kind of cash, you are capable of
buying a weapon like that, and a lot of people do,
even untwinked.  Its a lot better than saving up enough
to buy a combine weapon from a vendor; buying from
players is almost always a better idea.
