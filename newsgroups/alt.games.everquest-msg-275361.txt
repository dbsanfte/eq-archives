Not sure about those but bronze and blackend iron ore goes for about 2g
on Runnyeye.

As for none rare (ignoring the idiots who sell tin cluster for 1g):

T1 - 1C
T2 - 1C to 25c
T3 - 25c to 1g

My wizard, lvl 23 has about 83g  (If you include what I've spent and
all the hand-me-downs to alts it would be over 1p). A lot of that has
come recently when I worked out the best to make money. My summoner,
lvl 14, has vastly more money then any other char I had at that level
and will undoubtedly be richer then my wizard is at lvl 23.

I rarely craft and when I do rarely sell the items I make. Craftings
what I do when I want a break from adventuring. Money comes from
selling loot, quests and harvesting.

The problem I see with carpenters is most people aren't that
interested in buying furniture for their rooms (If this games was
called Sims 2 you'll be laughing all the way to the bank!). Out of
the few that are once you bought a bed, cupboards etc you don't need
another one, so the demand simply isn't there.
