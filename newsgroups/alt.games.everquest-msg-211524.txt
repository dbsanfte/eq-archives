Get a horse and you don't have to worry about sitting and standing in 
outdoor zones.  I had a two-boxed chanter for a while and getting him on 
a horse was the best thing I ever did for my sanity.

As for your hotkey, something like:
/stand
/target <member>
/cast 2
/cast 2
/gsay Incoming Heal on %t

will catch most fizzles.  Should keep the spam after the casts since 
there's a .25 second delay between lines.  Should you get a horse, take 
out the /stand and put another /cast in there to really be sure.
