Funny, I found TTT moved slower than FotR - in the beginning.  Once the 
battles started, it picked up very quickly.

It *is* true, and I forgot about that when I posted - I'd asked a friend 
for confirmation earlier since I really can't remember the book all that 
well - but yes, Faramir, iirc, was very cool about the ring, and the 
book made a point out of contrasting the reactions of the brothers to 
the ring, and I think he also made a speech about how Boromir was always 
lusting after more power for men or something of the sort.  Dammit, 
where IS that book?

Yeeeesss... but didn't they have to clue them in in the book too?  And 
Treebeard did mention that there's not nearly enough of them for the job 
of treeherding anymore.  Maybe the gossip hadn't reached one of em yet 
:p

Eowyn is *very* pretty, except for the fact that she keeps her eyes as 
wide as is humanly possible for 99% of the film.  But yes, she's an 
extremely pretty woman.

Liv annoys me too, Cate... with Cate all I can think about is that bit 
where she shows what'd happen if she took the ring, so 'silly' is firmly 
attached to her image in my mind ;p

*snicker* Nobody show that guy the Very Secret Diaries series.  Good god 
man, EVERYBODY in that movie is gay.

(And yes, McKellan is openly gay)
