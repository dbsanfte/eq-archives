While possible to solo a rogue, it is not easy. And if you only play for 1
hour or so at a stint, I would play a mage or a wizard (assuming you are
going to stick to DE).

Wizard can solo, root + nuke. I think it is boring, but some people like it.
Later you can quad.
Mage pet + nuke, also no heading to town for food/water (cuts into that 1
hour). The only thing you need to really ever buy are spells and pet
components.

Someone mentioned necro, they are just harder to get faction where you might
want to go.

You are fine on the moon as a DE in the places you will start out.
Eventually there will be some people that don't like you, but not for a
while.
