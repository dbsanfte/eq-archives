    Drat, and to think I burned a Thurg Gate potion last night getting down.

    It was to the point where I avoided all zones with port circles.

    Yay, I can start putting points in it again! I hope they didn't get rid
of the OTHER unintended effect that I noticed....

    And if you're paging me, I'm in Skyfire with the (on our server, as of
this morning) 20 rangers, 15 druids, 10 bards, and 50 clerics. The Ragefire
camp has gone from a possibly three day, non-stop camp where some folks
aren't civil to a two to three day, free-for-all camp where NOBODY will
respect anything. I sure do hope the new Skyfire version of Ragefire is
difficult enough (like Talendor or higher) to eliminate a bunch of folks
from the running, and that his other drops (like CoF) have been stripped so
he isn't farmed for drops.

    James
