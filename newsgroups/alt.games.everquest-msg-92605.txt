Heh. I think I expected different advice from a master tailor... =)

Up until very recently, I wore Karana-imbued Vale Leather items in almost 
every slot (in fact, I still wear the earrings). It has very nice stats 
for Druids, WIS and STA mostly, although a few pieces have a -STR hit, 
which isn't that big of a deal given your strenght buffs. This, of 
course, implies finding a high-level tailor able (and willing) to make 
it,  and a higher-level druid capable of imbuing the necessary Plains 
Pebbles. Still, it may work out cheaper than some other choices (for 
example, Molten Cloak or Mammoth-hide Cloak still run to about 700pp in 
Fennin).
