I'm just going to respond to this part of the posting right now.
While I don't like the TCC at all, it in no way forces higher levels
to buy batwings, bone chips or anything else like that for any amount
of money.  The TCC only affects things like Lore items, No Drop items
and (I believe, could be wrong here) Magic items.  Normal stuff will,
as stated repeatedly by Verant, drop for anyone and everyone.

Other than that, I basically agree with you here.
