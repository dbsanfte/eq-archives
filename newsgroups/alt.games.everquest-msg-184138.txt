From the shadows, the mysterious Rob Berryhill
<rob_berryhill@hotmail.com> (if that IS his real name)
conspiratorially whispered:

Here's where the people are, not necessarily where the best experience
is:

>
>12-15 = ?

Nobody groups at these levels anymore.

>15-20 = ?

Paludal

>20-25 = ?

Paludal, LoIO

>25-30 = ?

Marus Seru, Highkeep, Netherbian, Dawnshroud

>30-35 = ?

Dawnshroud, Highkeep, Overthere

>35-40 = ?

Dawnshroud

>40-45 = ?

Dawnshroud, Dreadlands

>45-50 = ?

Dawnshroud

>50-55 = ?

Sebilis, Maiden's Eye, Fungus Grove


YMMV. Things change. And a lot of people are in froggy zones right
now, but I don't know which ones, not having gotten that expansion
yet.
