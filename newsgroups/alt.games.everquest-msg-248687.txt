Yeah.. but why? The difference was that the Apple Macintosh was a
proprietary closed system that you had to jump through hoops to
support. The IBM compatible was an open system.. what this meant was
any company in the world could sit down.. design a circuit board that
worked off of the bus, write a driver, manufacture, and sell
worldwide. And, in turn they also didn't have to comp back part of
what they made to IBM, I don't think the same was true with Apple. As
such.. the IBM compatible gave rise to entire industries in
motherboard generation, sound cards, video cards, scanners, modems,
and any other conceivable electronic device adaptable to the PC.

It wasn't just complex scientific equipment. Any new product that came
down the pipe could adapt. Things that weren't even a consideration
when the systems came out.
