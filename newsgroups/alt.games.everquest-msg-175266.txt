You know, I did the SAME EXACT THING.  When I realized I clicked
Pre-Order I tried to CTRL+ALT+DEL to cancel it.  I never got a
confirmation.  However, when I went to the website to see what the
expantion was all about I thought it was cool so I'm going to keep it.
 It's a good level range for my Level 41 bard.  I'm hoping they have
more dungeons in that range than outdoor zones.
