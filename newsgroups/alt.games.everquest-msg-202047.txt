Question about names, surnames, and titles.

You *HAVE* to have a name...you ca't be nameless.  Understand that.
Surnames are optional....not a problem.
At certain level, you get a "title".  Okay, then.

As fas as the surame goes, you can spend your entire EQ life without one.  
What about surnames?  Can you elect to *NOT* have it, or are you stuck 
with it when you reach that level of EQ-ness?

Now, the reason for the question.  I have been trying to come up with a 
surname for Miznit the Gnomish Wizard (there is no message there, just a 
random "word" that came to mind when I created him) since he was in his 
early teens.  He has now reached that point in his life where he can 
choose a last name.   I've decided not to give him one - ever.  ANd, the 
thought came to me to see if I could take him to the end without the 
titles, etc, so that at 65 he'd be, simply, Miznit the Gnomish Wizard.

That's all I wanna know, right now anyway.

Miznit, the Gnomish Wizard of E'Ci, 20 and a half ;)
