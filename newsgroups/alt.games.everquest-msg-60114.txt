Hiyas

Probably a stupid question, but thought I'd ask it. I played EQ for nearly 2
years from its original release and after an extended break I've decided to
start again from scratch as I gave my old account to a friend. I've decided
against playing on my 'old' server (Tunare) as most of the people I knew are
long gone so it'd be kinda wierd.

Soooo to get to the point, would any of the servers be better suited to a
'new' player? My reason for asking is that I remember a few servers had
problems being over run by uber guilds or grief guilds, and just wanted a
friendly server that will - hopefully - have a decent number of low level
players to grow up with? I'm also guessing that the recent release of DAoC
(which I found a little bland) will have poached a lot of players and whilst
I don't want to be on a crowded server - I wouldn't want to be on an empty
one either. ;)

Anyhows thanks for reading and any suggestions you can give me :)
