How many people does it *take* to make it through the trials? I didn't 
think it was that many.

That's just it. It's *nothing* to those who already completed the trials. 
It affects them *not at all*. Reparations could be argued for many, many 
changes that have been made. It's a silly and unproductive concept.

I guess I feel that a strong guild presence *should* be required to get 
to the very best content. These encounters should be impossible without 
that kind of organized approach. They're gods and dragons for crying out 
loud.
