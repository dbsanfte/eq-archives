If you read his post he said the third guy showed " I guess wanting to camp
the Jester."
The third guy never said " If you see the Jester tell me, I'm camping him"

And usually people throw friendliness out the window for uber-loot, on my
server (Tarew Marr) Pyzjn has an average life expectancy of about 4 seconds
it seems, she is almost ALWAYS camped.

Also, as per the Play Nice Policy, No one "owns" a particular spawn, whoever
attacks the Mob first is the one to whom it should go.

PS. people who dont bother to type out "people" really suck.
