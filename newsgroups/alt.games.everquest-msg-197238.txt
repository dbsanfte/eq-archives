In the Bazaar zone in the Luclin expansion, type /bazaar and you'll get a search
mode of players selling gear.  Try hard to avoid buying any gear off vendors,
its almost always 10 times as expensive as what players will charge for
comperable stuff.

Or loot gear for yourself, you should by now be in full cloth armor with a
splintering club or worn great staff even if you've never sold one piece of gear
to a vendor.

In order to be able to afford gear, there are a few things you can do.  If you
have the Luclin expansion, you can collect spider silks, spiderling silks, and
non-ruined pelts (bear, wolf, cat, mostly) and bone chips and sell them in the
bazaar in Trader mode, these loots sell to other players quickly and at prices
far higher than any other drops you will pick up.  Or you can hunt Will o Wisps
and collect the Greater Lightstones they sometimes drop, take them to a certain
gypsy in the Oasis zone (or S.Ro or NK, but Oasis is easiest) to hand in for
nice experience and a book that sells for nearly 10pp

Search the bazaar for gear that says effect: serpent sight (worn).  I think the
cheapest one is likely a Glowing Stone Band, an all/all ring.  You probably
can't afford even this yet.

This is a whole other topic, and astonishingly open ended.  Hang out here in the
newsgroup for a while each day and you'll see hundreds of tips being passed
around.  Most important skill to train, meditate.  You got the opportunity back
at level 4, hope you put a point in there, if you did its surely maxed out by
now for your level.  Other than that, I'd put a point in to each skill you have
and not worry other than that, save points for Research, and when you get that,
put every point you get into it except for 5 saved to go into the five
Specialize skills (which you get at 20th, IIRC)
