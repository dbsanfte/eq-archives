I got :

[Wed Mar 13 00:59:24 2002] <SYSTEMWIDE MESSAGE>: 
Lead_GM-Kriggan : We would like to thank you for your 
continued support of EQ!  In celebration of our 3rd 
anniversary be prepared to see the unseen and to meet those 
never met before...


So i guess this is appropriate:

Happy Birthday!

I don't care what is written about me so long as it isn't true.
