No, Uo2 died because some idiot marketing people at EA said, "But we'd
dillute our market share  so its better to not make something that
competes with UO!!!!" and some EA executive said, "SOUNDS GOOD TO ME,
PLZ TO PULL THE PLUG AND BURN DESIGN DOCUMENTS, LA~ "

This will go down in gaming mmorpg history as one of the biggest
blunders ever. TONS of uo players and TONS of mmorpg players were
ready to try UO2. I hated UO1 and UO2 sounded fantastic, I was on
board for the beta and ready to upgrade my PC to the "origin"
requirement levels and everything (see Ultima 9) 
It sounded like one of the most kick ass mmoprgs ever to be made.

The entire problem was that origin let EA own them and make the
decisions. 

Players being angry and bitching = zero concern to a business out to
make money. In this case the goobers just assumed that they'd not be
making money, which was incredibly ignorant. People want a good
mmorpg, they don't care what genre its in (sci fi, fantasy etc), they
just want a good working MMORPG and often their only requirement is
that its better than the last one/one they are playing now is. An
example is all the people who left EQ to play Anarchy online for a
month or Daoc for three months. In both cases the people all came back
because even though these games were new and shiney they have no where
near the staying power of EQ. Now they are back in EQ waiting for
another mmorpg better than EQ. They don't know whether or not it will
be SWG, Worlds of warcraft, Everquest 2, or Shadow(vapor)bane (which
might actually be out by then) People are incredible rabid, slavering
fanboys for MMORPGS so EA totally blew it in applying some marketing
crap reasoning and coming up with UO2 being ditched because a tiny
smattering of people still played UO1. What a backwards assed choice
when the next generation of games like EQ has 400,000 subscribers. 

There is no way to tell, but if Uo2 was anywhere near as good as it
looked I would have predicted subscription numbers of half a million,
certainly far more than UO1 had in its heyday. Just from word of mouth
it seemed that 75 percent plus of the people wanting to at least try
UO2 had never liked or even never tried UO1.

They will. It will be "everquest **** " something but not just
everquest and I bet it won't be "2".  Everquest is a brand name with
value just like Ultima would have been for UO2.
