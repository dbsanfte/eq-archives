So basically you say you suck as a slower shaman?  I can hold agro when the
rest of the party does their part.  31% base haste, 12/19 1HS with a 70
point DD plus stun proc, 12/18 with a 60 point dd proc, taunt, disarm, slam.
The only way I cannot hold agro is if casters are too quick with their
spells.  MTed in PON for 4 hours with no problems except when we first
started, echanter would not wait until mob was at 90% to slow, he died real
quick, but learned, and towards the end of the 4 hours when we got a new
cleric who did not know that CHeals need to be cast when MT was at 50% until
mob was slowed.  Many tanks totaly suck.  Guild firend of mine thinks STA
and HPs are more imporatant than AC.  At level 58 my unbuffed AC is 1202 and
HPs are 3368.  When i finally get AAs for ND3 my Hps will be over 3600 if I
do it at this level.  More if I wait until 60s to do AAs.  Area Tuant AA
will be something I spend points on too.

So amybe casters like you should group with Knights.  Since you all enjoy
taking agro you need the knights to stun and pull mobs off of you.  SO
again.  Maybe you just suck?
