Which was sllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllow in comparison to
today. Trying to suggest players, especially those that didn't play
back then for exactly that reason, to go back to a rate of progress
that was equal to what there was in '99 would be harsh to say the
least. One of the reasons it worked in '99 is that you had devoted
gamers.. and there weren't many other viable options.

Yes.. but those who put in 5 hours can still have some somewhat
respectable gear via the droppable stuff. Using your suggestion they
basically have to get guilded up and raid for it.. something
non-conducive to their 5 hour play style. You kill casual gaming by
removing droppable items.. its as simple as that.
