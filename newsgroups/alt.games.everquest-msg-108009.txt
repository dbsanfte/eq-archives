  Well, I understand where he's coming from.  Once I was waiting the boat in
TD to meet someone in OT to buy something... the person in OT was going to
log off soon, so I was eager to make it there soon.  The boat arrives and I
board it, but as the boat leaves the dock and makes the first turn, I all
the sudden find msyelf in the water... and I can't swim fast enough to catch
up wth the boat.

  So I /petition and give a very detailed explanation of what happened,
including a /loc of where I think I got pushed off.  I wait on the dock, and
a Guide appears... then he gives me a canned response asking what he can
help me with.  It'd be obvious if he read the petition.  I ended up
repeating everything to him, which only got me more "worked up".  If
something bad happens to me, describing it in detail again isn't going to
remind me how happy I am about it.  Anyway, the Guide couldn't end up
helping me, which I understood, it wasn't something I thought he'd be able
to verify, but it was worth a shot since I really was in a hurry.  But I was
irked at the way he had introduced the conversation... I did get the FEELING
that he had not read my petition, even if he did.  That's just a bad
impression to give your customers, whether it's a false impression or not.
