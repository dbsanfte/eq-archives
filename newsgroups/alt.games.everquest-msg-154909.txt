50pp seems to be the normal going rate on EMarr in Nexus.  I usually get
thanked for it, I always thank the caster.  I never send a tell to anyone
asking, I just hang out in nexus, and within 5 minutes max, someone is
oocing that they are casting.  Once in a while someone announces they are
MGBing it.
