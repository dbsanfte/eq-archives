Wow. I hope Sony didn't pay too much for that Umbra stuff. Processors just
aren't fast enough to do what they attempted to do, making the end product
look like a bad hack. The pop-up I get is so strange, I cant see how the
Umbra stuff is helping...

The problem is, the Umbra technology has to deal with huge outdoor zones,
with poorly sorted polygons. Its hard to sort polygons for outdoor areas
effectively to begin with, adding another software layer on top to help wont
do much good. Certainly its possible to write software to keep polygons that
aren't seen from drawing, when you're dealing with unsorted polygon soup.
But for now its faster to just sort the polygons as good as you can and not
worry too much about it. Most 3d software (with mostly indoor areas) can
sort polygons really well - its easy to see that if you're in a certain
room, there are only a small subset of polygons you need to worry about.
That why the Quake series can run so fast, very good polygon sorting. Give
the Quake 3 engine an EQ zone, and it'll choke like a, um, something that
chokes. Put a player in the middle of a field - which polygons can you
effectively not draw? Well, maybe 2 behind that hill, but the player had
better not move too much. Umbra tried to figure out which 2 polygons to
remove. Bleh.

I've been worried about this 'magical' Umbra stuff since they announced
theyd be using it. There is just no way a program can efficiently decide
what should be drawn on the fly, without lots of help from zone compiling
with good polygon sorting. Umbra tried to do this without that advantage,
and it was bad.

Whew, sorry. Theres my dumb rant of the day. :)
