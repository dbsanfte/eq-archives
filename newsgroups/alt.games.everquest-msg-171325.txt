Not such a silly question, I remember trying to figure out how to get 
rid of stuff the stupid merchants wouldn't buy.  Instead of getting rid 
of it, you should look it up and see if it's used in any quests that get 
you some experience or money or free items.  everquest.allakhazam.com is 
where I usually go to look up stuff, try this page 
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/searchdb.html  that is the search 
page for the site.

What server do you play on?  and what is your character name?

Bebinn Maolcataig 20 Druid/Test server
Bebinn Maolcataig 40 Druid/Bertoxx server
