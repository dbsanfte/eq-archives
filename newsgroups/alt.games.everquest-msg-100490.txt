At least there are only a handful of people who play that get a sense of
paranoia about being inspected.  If someone sees my stuff, they'll see that
I'm the most pathetic, untwinked slob they've ever seen.  I don't get a
complex over it.  If you do, then you should turn off inspection nags.
I constantly mouselook and accidentally inspect CONSANTLY.  It's not
intentional.  If someone has something I truly care to see, I'll ask.

Looking at your equipment......
