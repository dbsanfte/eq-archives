Hi guys;
   I actually feel pretty good this am. Danora is doing pretty well for an
untwinked toon who started cold..{No Tutorial).

   At Level 7 she has 10 Plat and a few decent pieces of the quest
armor{Ghulum gloves, BST Newbie Kilt and cap, Frostweavers Shield.

  I was waiting to take your advice and go to Paludal Caverns after I got a
bit more gear, So I think I may try it today.

                     Thanks and have a good day;
                                      Sherri
