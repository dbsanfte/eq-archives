}I don't think it works like that, at least on snow griffins.  I've noticed
}they go pretty fast even when snared.  If it was an overwrite then the speed
}would be gone but it isn't, it's just reduced.  I think they just have an
}innate fast runspeed and so snare reduces it by a percent.

Pillage Enchantment frequently slows them down considerably.  Like, to the 
point that sowed gnomes can successfully run away.  *shrug*.
