Double edge sword there I guess. 
You believe the PR because that's what they tell you.
But you don't believe anyone else.
But a system wide message saying "Woot, we hit 100K,
it's a record" and you buy it. I understand you have no reason to
think you'd be lied too,but come on. Do you really believe EQ never
hit 100K before. When back in the beginning and all the news and PR
and hype hit.Back when there was 400K+ accounts, when everybody and
their mother was playing EQ , do you really think it never hit 100K
when having 400K+ people playing.
You have to admit it's hard to believe back then that less than 25% of
the players were playing.
If that's the case that's really shitty numbers
