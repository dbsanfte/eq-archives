You're right.. they are much closer, however I still believe there are
significant differences. It also depends what you compare. If you
compare hz to hz, there is virtually no price difference, however,
(and some googling will surely support this) the P4 is a HUGE step
backwards as far as efficiency and technical achievement goes. It was
a nice processor at concept, but what it ended up being is a pile of
crap. Without going to much into technical details, here are some of
the huge mistakes:

- The cache is WAY to small (and the 1MB L3 cache that it was supposed
to have never materialized). For example the L1 cache is 8k. Let me
say that again: 8K. That's what the 486 had. 10-15 years ago!
- They basically removed the decoder
- They reduced execution units. Yes reduced. They took execution units
out.
- changed the number of pipelines - this is HUGE. difficult to explain
but basically, a binary can only be optimized for a P4 or an earlier
pentium now. That means: a) all programs that are not recompiled will
not use the (diminished) full capacity of the P4. b) all programs
compiled for the P4 will not be efficient on older processors.
- slow execution units: some shifts take 4-6 processor cycles. the
same operatoin used to take _ONE_ processor cycle on the 486. 15 years
ago.
- crippled MMX - the very feature they brag about. it can only do 1
floating point operation per two cycles.
- by fixing the age-old pentium problem of register stalls, in
combination with the slow shifts, it sometimes now takes longer to
load data from a register than L1 cache. that is the most
ass-backwards design ever. The registers are supposed to be THE
fastest memory - under ANY circumstances - and not by a little.
- removed AGUs
- even today most compilers have yet to be correctly optimized for the
P4 (which is incredibly difficult due to all its design flaws). Unless
you really know what you are doing, your compiler will most likely
produce dog-slow machine code for P4s. If you want to run an
application that is processing intensive, you basically have to
provide several binaries now.

Here is (a rather long, but very well written and detailed)
explanation:
http://www.emulators.com/docs/pentium_1.htm

Anyway, point being, a AMD will execute the same code under virtually
all circumstances faster, and we're talking about a factor of 2 to 8
at times.

Why doesn't this show up in many popular benchmarks? Because most
often, they want the comparison to be "fair", that is, they will use
code optimized for each processor on it and compare those results. The
reality however is that by far most software distributes only one
binary, and it is almost never optimized for the P4.

I'll take a 2Ghz AMD over the fastest P4 any day. I dare anyone to set
these two side by side and be able to tell me which is which. And that
is still a significant price difference (from pricewatch):

Athlon 2400 (ie 2ghz): $70
P4 3Ghz: $268

On top of that AMD motherboards tend to be cheaper as well.

So in conclusion, while the prices are not as far apart as they used
to, you are still much better off investing that money into AMD.

Most of the big new problem viruses spread through email as well as
directly. A firewall alone without the software patches is a
completely fake sense of security even if you have only 2 computers.
What if your wife/SO/whoever accidentally (or not - Outlook has a
security track record like sendmail) opens a virus on his/her/your
computer, behind the firewall? No matter how many security products
you install, keeping your machine up-to-date is THE most effective way
to combat viruses. Most viruses use exploits that have been known and
fixable for several months prior to the virus release.
