Um, that _is_ multi-questing.  Each turn-in is separate, you cannot

possibly complete it with a single turn-in.  Disable multi-questing
without removing the LORE tag on the Drom's and the quest is broken.
Keep in mind the underlying mechanics, the NPCs have very little
"memory", all they've really got is a handful of static states, a
target, and a "hate" list.  From the game's perspective there is no
difference between separate turn-ins by a single character and separate
turn-ins by multiple characters.
