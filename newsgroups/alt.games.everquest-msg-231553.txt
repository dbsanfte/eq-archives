The gnolls in Splitpaw drop a decent amount of fine steel weapons.  I
wouldn't imagine it's nearly 500pp an hour, but you can make a little
scratch there.  Some of the gnolls drop gnoll-hide lariats which might sell
for 10-50pp in the bazaar.  At 38 I think it should be green and farmable -
the last time I went there fishing for lariats the zone was completely
empty.
