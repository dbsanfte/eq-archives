Can you do things with people without being grouped with them yet?  That was
my biggest beef with EQ2.  As a Druid, I couldn't just give SOW to random
people, or heal someone who was having trouble in a fight (unless they asked
for it, and gave up all XP from the fight).

It felt to me more like a single player/single group game where you just
happened to be able to see and talk to other single players/single groups,
as opposed to feeling like an MMORPG.
