Actually, I've found Flash of Light will make the mob run away from
you, but you have to move away from the mob after they get blinded or
else it will still stand there and hit you.  So when you cast FOL, and
you see the message saying  "MOB has been blinded by a flash of
light", back up away from the mob, then it will run off.  

It's also a really nice spell for shamans and BLs who don't get the
Fear spell.
