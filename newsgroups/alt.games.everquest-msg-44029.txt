amen to that . It has been my experience that in a party with a 60 rogue and
a 51 warrior  that the 51 warrior can keep continous aggro giving the rogue
continous backstabs without a problem at all . rogues alos do more than 40%
more dammage than a warrior . Monks pre kunark outdammaged warriors by more
than 20% as well . My guess is that they are not counting double backstabs.
All things considered i still think that after these changes monks will
still be a very second class citizen to both rogues and warriors . On the
bright side this is the 4th time they have dramatically increased the power
of the semis so maybe they will get it right eventually.

One thing Daoc gets right is how it compares generalists to specialists . In
Daoc you can have one of a 800pt heal, 800 pt nuke or a 80 pt buff , or as a
generalist you get the 700pt nuke AND the 700pt heal AND the 70 pt buff. The
reason necros and druids are so massively screwed and dissappearing is that
they get nowhere even close to the specialists.
