Played the beta and the pre-release. This game is awesome even with the bugs 
it currently has. Diplomacy is a very powerful tool especially if you get 
involved with civic diplomacy. I spent 7 hours online today and didnt even 
get my mace out, but what an enjoyable 7 hours. I don't know of any other 
MMORPG that you can play this long without having to kill something.
