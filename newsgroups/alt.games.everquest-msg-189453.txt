Pain in the ass _to_kill_ ;)

Between their damage shields and big damage spells, I've been taken down in 
Sol A by a pair of green conning wizards that had no additional help.  
Gotta watch the ones in Runnyeye too.

Also a note: many many of the goblins in Sol A backstab if you turn your 
back, so watch that too.
