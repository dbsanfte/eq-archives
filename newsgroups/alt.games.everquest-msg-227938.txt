    He's level 63, and should be able to clear small numbers of goblins
without risk of dying horribly. Should be. ;-)

    There's a tunnel near the room where he spawns that is a secret tunnel -
both ends are illusionary. One end of it comes out in the room just before
the Goblin King's room. If you camp midway down the tunnel, you should be
safe - no wanderers. Then move to the end, clear the room before the King's
room (pull into the tunnel to avoid adds, full runner prevention protocols
in effect), and cross the room to the door across from the hidden tunnel,
being careful to avoid the door to the King's room. That door leads into the
Gimblox chamber - you'll likely aggro one or two mobs right near the door,
but if he's up you shouldn't train yourself.
