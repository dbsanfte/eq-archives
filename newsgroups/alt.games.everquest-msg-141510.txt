In order for one of the specialization skills to go over 50, all of them
need to have a minimum of one point trained in them.  Once one of them goes
over 50, that is your area of specialization, and it is the only one that
will go over 50.  It will max out at 200 I believe, the others will max out
at 50.  The others will never go over 50.
