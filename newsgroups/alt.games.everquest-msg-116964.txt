    Other than the baking stuff I don't think a single tradeskill item from
CT has been made. The drops are too rare, and once players hear that
something is broken they don't go back. The general rule to remember about
trash items there *seems* to be this: if it weighs 3 pounds, it's junk, if
it weighs one pound, it's for the trades.
