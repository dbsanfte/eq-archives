Hi.

I was bored today and saw the offer for a free month of eq. It's been a
while since I destroyed all my origanl eq discs (right aftter sol came out),
but started jonesing today to play a bit. I decided to make a necro and
started in Paineel. I tried to go through a portal to get back to my guild
but the entrence seemed not to work. So I ran around back of it and ended up
in some tower way up high with absolutley no way out. The room
is round and completley incased in glass. Theres a red platform in the
center but that does nothing either. Tried to get a gm but do you think one
was
on? Of course not. Just curious if anyone else has figured a way out... I
figure its the room they put people in who play too much eq...Either that or
they
lock you in there until your free month is up and only let you out once you
start lining Vareants pockets with some cold hard cash....
makes me remember why I destroyed all my discs in the first place.

Cheers
