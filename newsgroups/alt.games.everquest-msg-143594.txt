Actually in a controlled situation, its possible to keep a
warrior in berserk mode constantly, which massively
increases his damage output.  CHeal isn't the key
to this trick, smaller heals or well planned use of HOT
is the key... that and fighting slowed or lower level
mobs.

who only does this with warriors who have shown they
will laugh off the occaisional death.. cause Lag kills!
