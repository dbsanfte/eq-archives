HAHA ok - I should have used the term Exponentially. 

Now... If I were to graph the number of mobs vs the number of times I
stood up.. bahhh was going to dig up some old calculus equations, but,
damn, its been like 15 years since ive had calculus (does it show?), I
think all I remember were simple integrations and derivatives. I can
hear my old calculus teacher now, threatening to twist my ears off
because I've forgetten it all (not that I really understood it all at
the time).
