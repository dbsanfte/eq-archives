I have an enchanter who is now in her mid 40's and have been thinking for
some time now whether I should take the time and make the financial
investment to try and master Jewelcraft.  I know that it is expensive and
was wondering if other players have found it worthwhile and have any tips?

In addition to this, does anyone know what effect the new SoL expansion may
have on this trade skill?

Thanks in advance for your help,


Kaz.
