And so it goes, that on the third attempt (in the first one I
miscalculated and had to zone, on the second one a guard had already
taken off about 20 percent of Grimfy's health, rendering the feat
tainted) GrimFeather fell to my cowardly fear-kiting tactics, with no
outside help from buffs or guards. Not bad for a level 35... :)

It took so long that *ensnare* wore off during the fight, but I can
finally scratch that off the list of things to do I have pretty much
since I started playing EQ. :)

Solo a Hill Giant: check

Solo GrimFeather: check

See a Dragon: check

See the Terrorantula: NOT YET... ARRGH!
