Same thing that has always gone on with the EQ economy. The game
generates an essentially infinite supply of everything (coins, items,
etc) and has only a very few cash sinks. Nothing ever wears out or
breaks, and Sony regularly provides an influx of newer, more powerful
items to keep the upper-end players interested. It is only an
'economy' in the very loosest sense of the word.
