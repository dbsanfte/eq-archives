I've only been playing for a little under a year now, so when I heard this
the other day it was news to me. I've heard something about how halflings
have/had an experience bonus.  Is this true?  and if so, does it still
exist? And lastly, if it is/was around, is it just halflings, or are the
other littles (gnomes and dwarves) part of it as well?

Seems odd to me that they would have it, since a halflings stats are
nothing to spit at, but not everything in this game makes sense.
