Ben (I think) was talking about keyrings in serverwide.age, and people were
listing their /key results.

I was sat in Iceclad or something (it was during my lodi camps), typed in
/key, and reported back my keys - which 100% included all my vexthal keys.

I had my keys before they went onto /keyring, and since the day they were
added to keyring, I've seen them in any zone.

Ask another keyed guildie to /key and tell you what he sees
