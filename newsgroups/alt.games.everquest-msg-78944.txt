I used to use Konqueror, but it crashes on Allakhazam.  Every time.  Now, I 
use Mozilla, and if I recall correctly, the drop-down menus just do not 
work, as if Mozilla isn't supporting their Javascript.

I'll try it again when I think about it, but I'm pretty sure that's the 
problem I was having.

My guild's EZBoard shows up fine in Mozilla so far, but it's a new board.
