Unfortunately, most are.  I just keep track of those that are the
role-players and try to always group with them.

*laugh*  I'm into role-playing big time.  Even as a mere 5th level, I gave
an extensive tour of Rivervale to someone who had just arrived from
somewhere else.  All in character.  It was a blast and much appreciated by
the person that I gave a tour to.  I've also hung out in the fresh newbie
area and healed, buffed, and acted like an elder of the village.  It was
fun.  Had my little own entourage that I lead around showing the sights.
I've also had a great time playing hide-n-go-seek with my character totally
drunk as were the others that participated.  I've spent all night one time
hunting spiderlings webs and spiders webs for a player that wanted to learn
tailoring.  Never accepted a copper piece for it.  All done in character as
a friend of a friend.  I just had fun enabling them to have fun.  By far, I
think Rivervale is the best place for those into roleplaying ... or at least
is on the Tunare server.

I've also role-played around in Freeport though that town feels like a ghost
town in comparison to Rivervale.  :-P

However, I've also enjoyed the Hunt in Oasis.  Rarely though saw any
role-playing there.  However, the Hunt can only go so far.  Right now I need
a break from groups.  As a cleric, they can be quite taxing, especially the
immature ones that treat clerics as mana sponges and never even talk to them
the whole time you're with them.  As of now, I commonly tell the groups that
take clerics for granted that they're not what I'm seeking in a group, tell
them what I feel is missing, and then gate out.  I don't hold any group
hostage to my demands.  I want only those that are naturally nice to be nice
to me.  Anyway, I'm now on my way to Lake Rathe to do some solo spawns as a
break away from groups.  Possibly I'll miss them after one day of soloing.
Possibly not.  However, I do have a Preferred list and if any of them are
anywhere, I'll either form up a group of us or head to where they are.  And
if it is to just hunt down greens because of some silly character idea (a
character has a phobia of spiderlings and seeks help to eliminate them from
the face of the Norrath), I'm there to assist in the great adventure and
play my character to the hilt.

I said I didn't like it myself.

I like the idea of honor looting.  Basically that is what I call "clean-up"
looting by the receiving tank.

There's just too much turn-over for this to be seriously done ... or at
least at my level when I was in Oasis.

Yes, I think it would be much preferred to either alpha or honor/clean-up
looting.

Then why allow the auto-split of the coins?  Why allow the magical transfers
of all you coins and stuff between banks without you transporting the stuff
to the banks?  Why allow auto-attack?  There are a lot of automation in EQ.
This would be just one of them and would help reduce hurt feelings ... or at
least that's what I think would happen.

I've seen too many problems with looting.  It rarely yields good group
interactions.  It usually ends up causing hurt feelings, flaming (Hey!  Stop
ninja-looting!), and other such problems.  My suggestion would hopefully try
to help prevent that from happening ... as much.
