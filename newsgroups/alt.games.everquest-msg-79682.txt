 Too bad you don't play on Veeshan. I could use some more Plat. As I
stated, guild gimp monks have killed him. I happened to be there the
last time (but didn't participate) and we only had 8 people there. Only
one warrior was in attendence. I believe we only had one cleric as well
but I can't remember. And this was without gimping him by giving him a
2hb.

 I have a level 60 Iksar monk, thanks. I have sat through many exciting
camps like Raster (at least 30 hours), Targin (8 hours), Betrayer (6
hours) and Pawduster (~40-50 hours total). I have also done all the
Shackle quests, including the Bronze shackle. Twice, since it was so
much fun the first time. Quick to judge? Not exactly. I've put in my
time. 


 Hey, if he wants to quit EQ go ahead. But saying "If I don't get raster
within a month I'll quit" is just an excuse to do so. EQ only becomes
more a job than entertainment if you let it.


 However, some people, including myself, are probably getting too
defensive around here. Obviously Verant feels it's a valid path to the
quest or they wouldn't have him dropping the robe. While you're wearing
the robe, nobody knows the difference of where it comes from. I
personally feel it's gimpy and cheapens the quest to go straight for
Brother Zephyl, but that's just me. If you don't care how you arrive
there choose whatever path you want. I feel it's lame and others don't.
There's really no right answer here and nobody ever said we had to
agree.
