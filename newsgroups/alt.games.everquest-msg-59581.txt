Now that you don't have to be in a Kunark Dungeon to
use the evacs, what difference is there between them
and ports?

Particularly, what the heck good is the only evac I
have at 29, the one that goes to EK?  I've never, not
once, had anyone ask for EK instead of NK.

Pure laziness on my part, I've never looked closely
at the thing, beyond sticking it in my spell book where
it sits, pristine and untouched.... is it cheaper on mana?
Quicker to cast?  Longer "group hug" range?

I know coming up I get an evac to BB>... where I
already have a Circle port!
