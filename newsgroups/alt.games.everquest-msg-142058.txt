Shield of Bane Warding.  AC25, WIS 20, some charisma, some save or other.

YOu will need your group, it is a quest, and it can be long.  8 to 14 hours
for the skulls.  Burning Priest, who knows, I got lucky one day and he was
up, did him with me at 53, and a cleric at 54.  For the turn in fights, you
will want an enchanter.
