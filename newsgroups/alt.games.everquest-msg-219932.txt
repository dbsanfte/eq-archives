LOL me too. I 2-box , so Im usually looking at a few screens. I
usually only realize its enraged when I see the group's pet's health's
going down fast all of a sudden (or when my wife astutely points out
that its enraging - shes 2-boxing too but doesnt have a problem seeing
the enrage message *shrugs*)

As for the choice between the 2 weapons, I cant expunge on the details
better than anyone here has already, but I personally went with the
Windblade for my 62 SK. The riposite aspect really wasnt a deciding
factor for me, but mostly the stats on the weapon (chiefly AC). I was
coming from a widebladed great sword (which has, among other things 25
AC on it), and didnt want to trade 25 AC for the WMBS. The slower
delay on the Windblade is also handy against MOBs with damage shields
on them (which there seems to be quite a few in the LDON dungeons that
we do). Since Im an SK (well half of me is - the other half is a
chanter), generating fast aggro is not a problem.
