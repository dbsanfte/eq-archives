I generally avoid it at night too, simply because I'm quite able to
make my own trouble and don't need to let the mobs do it for me.
However, only once or twice have I ever run into death there.

Early on, when some folks were whining that it was a deathtrap, I did
a couple of experiments with level 1 characters (a night-blind human,
and a halfling), at night. I made something like 20 passes total along
the north wall, completely unbuffed, without getting touched.
