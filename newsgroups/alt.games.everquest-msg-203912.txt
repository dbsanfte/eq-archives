I was in pretty much the same boat as you as far as regretting looting 
the piece from Lodi...  Until I got my eyepatch ;)

IMO this is one of two useful general AA's (the other being regen 3).  
Not only useful when out of doors and too lazy to re-sow yourself, but 
nice for those times when you're indoors and sow runs out and you can't 
(easily) get outside to re-sow.  This is where my first 3 AA points went.

Would say it's a waste of AA.  I have a windblade (50/44) and have zero 
intention of getting this any time soon.

Correct on the prereqs thing.

Basically analogous to the rogue Assassinate ability, which I believe 
leaves a corpse.  Everything I've read says it's a waste of AA.  EQ/AM3 
are the best 27 (45 if you count the 18 required to unlock the class AAs) 
AA you will *ever* spend.  I would seriously re-evaluate the decision not 
to pursue it.

No, his spawn timer is evil.  He just sort of flew around and ignored me 
when he spawned after 13 hours ;)
