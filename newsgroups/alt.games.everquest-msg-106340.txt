  Well, it doesn't matter, because my friend was contacted by a GM, not a
guide.  But I doubt that /reports are "screenshots", storing them as
graphical screenshots would be needlessly wasteful.  What likely happens
with a /report is that when a player does a /reports, is this: the server
temporarily stores all happenings that are reported in people's text
boxes... when a player does a /report, the player's client sends the text to
the several and the server searches for instances of that text in memory,
and checks to see if it really happened.  If it did, this text is put in a
log file and is saved indefinately (while non-reported text in memory is
eventually purged.)

  And just because the information is stored serverside, doesn't mean a
Guide can't have access to it.  I mean, everything is stored serverside,
except our client preferences.  If a person with the proper authorization
requests the data, it would be a simple matter for the server to serve that
data.
