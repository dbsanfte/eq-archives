In real life, fighting on a horse is very difficult. Unless the horse is
well trained, it does tend to get in the way, and could get injured. In fact
horses not trained for this sort of thing tend to panic, dump their riders,
and run away. So having to target around the head is an easy compromise.

As for looting on a horse, when was the last time you were held several feet
above the ground and still able to pick something up off the floor? Be very
happy you don't have to dismount.
