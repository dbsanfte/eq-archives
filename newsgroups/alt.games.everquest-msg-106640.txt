As far as I'm aware though, wizard ports to GD drop you off at the dragon
circle though, which is mostly, but not completely, safe, a shardwurm might
show up every 20 min or so, and the occasional tizmak (if you're kos to
them), but other than that not much, certainly not the metric assload of
giants and wolves that make aoe faction groups fun around the spires.
