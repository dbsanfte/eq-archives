For a while there was a bug like that concerning the exp tweak
they did to remove the 40% hybrid experience penalty.  That tweak
gave hybrids a "free" 40% exp boost per kill, which balanced out
the 40% experience-per-level penalty they already had.

But when they added AA-exp to the game, they forgot to
reverse the 40% bonus, so for a few weeks after Luclin was
released hybrids were getting AA-exp 40% faster than other folks.

Then they caught their error and fixed it.

I would *hope* that they would have kept that flub in mind
when they did further exp-per-kill-at-level tweaking to smooth
out the hell levels.
