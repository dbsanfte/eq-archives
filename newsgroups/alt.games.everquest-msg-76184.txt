Subject: Good off-hand item for a caster

Can anyone recommend a good item to put in the off-hand for a caster for around
300-500pp? I'm trying to acquire something for my Enchanter to use, and don't
want a Stein of Moggok or a Crystalweb Shield; I used these in the past before
my Necromancer acquired a Harvester, and wasn't too happy with either. I wanted
a GBS, but wasn't able to get one the hard way, and there is no way I can
afford one, or would buy one if I could; 4k is a little steep.

I have come to realize that I am never going to get a GBS unless I have the
good fortune of running into someone who is quitting the game and they just
hand it to me (fat chance, but I can always hope). I camped Pyzjn for over 8
hours, and she only popped ONCE (the camp was spoiled by a newbie on two
occasions; I laughed the second time when he got slaughtered by five skels),
without the GBS (My Necromancer is carrying her Rusty Dagger in his range slot
until I can acquire an Innoruuk Idol). I'm not going  back to waste my time
there when I could be off fighting creatures that actually give me exp. 4k is
overpriced for what the stone does, in my opinion, so I don't think I'll be
buying one anytime soon, either.

(If anyone reading this can tell me how to get Pyzjn to spawn more often,
please speak up; I kept getting a stupid Putrid or regular Skeleton appearing
except for that one time she did spawn)
