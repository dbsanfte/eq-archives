Welcome to Battle.Net.  It's not your computer, it's not your connection. 
It happens to everyone when BNET is busy.

Welcome to EQ. It works most of the time for more people. :)
I can't even REMEMBER the last time I had connection problems with EQ.

It is not the network connection it's Battle.Net's servers. There's 
something that when they start getting overloaded causes them to just start 
screwing up. I only hope that Blizzard can work this out before they try 
charging a monthly fee because this would be totally unacceptable for EQ 
and it will also be unaacceptable for Worlds of Warcraft if and when that 
ever comes out. The only reason they get away with it now is because it's 
technically a "free" service. Wait until WC3 traffic starts to hit heavy.

Again, nothing wrong with your box. Although for an action game like 
Diablo2 a modem isn't going to be as good as on a broadband, but even if 
you have broadband you'll still experience lagouts and crap like you 
described on Battle.Net when it gets overloaded.
