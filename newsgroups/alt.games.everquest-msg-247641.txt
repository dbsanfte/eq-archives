Ignore the stinkhead ;) I waited till I had trueshot then used
a tolans bracer to plink at sergeant slate in EC to skillup. He's
easy to kite, no need to kill him to skill up either, although I
suppose plinking another groups mobs works just as well. 

Prior to EQ it can still be worth using trueshot with fletched
arrows for 'raid' targets if you have a decent bow, and that will
depend on your guild. But yeah, no need to worry for a good 20
levels yet ;)
