About a week ago I could get to the server select screen but for some 
unbeknownst reason the mouse scroller took forever to get to the Play 
button (the rest of the computer was fine - it was just EQ).

Anyways- I system restored to the last date I remembered playing EQ and 
it worked perfectly from there on in. Weird.
