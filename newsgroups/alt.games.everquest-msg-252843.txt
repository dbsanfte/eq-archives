Er, I did no such thing. You indicated you weren't going to change
your mind and use ">" no matter what and presented us with a list of
alternatives, none of which were standard and most or all of which
were even worse than what you were using. Given the alternatives of
the bad one you were already using and the even worse ones you were
suggesting, I told you you might as well keep using the bad one if you
weren't going to change to the good one.

And non-conformism just to be nonconformist is, itself, conformist and
unoriginal. If you want to be distinctive, call someone an asshole at
the end of every post or something. Me and Bradd have had many many
disagreements over the years but he's 100% right this time.

It's *bad* when you get schooled by Bateau of all people on
netiquette.

Agent also catches dash-dash-nothing as a sig delimiter even though
the proper form is dash-dash-space. The fact Agent thinks something is
okay does not make it standard. Agent just happens to be more
forgiving than other readers.

We'll at least you gave him a good shot back....
