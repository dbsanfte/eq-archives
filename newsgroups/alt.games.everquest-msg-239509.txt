Two moments, both recent have had me grinning from ear to ear though
neither are reproducible by newbies.

The first was casting KEI on myself for the first time. I'd had the
spell in the bank for almost a year. A friend of a friend sold it to
me for 35k back when it was regularly selling for 60k in the Bazaar.
By the time I reached level 60 (a couple of months ago) the spell was
selling for 15k in the Bazaar but I was not bothered - just glad to
finally be able to cast it!

The second happened last week. My wife and I killed Cazel (named SG)
in Oasis of Marr. We had had many deaths at his hands back in the days
when Oasis was THE mid-teens place to hunt and the revenge was oh so
sweet. We were both grinning like idiots when he dropped!
