This is not encouraging.  My 22 level Necro is still using my 16th level pet
because I have not yet come across the right words for the spell.  On a
positive note, I have not had and failures yet.  I am close to 23 and
decided to mover right to the 24th level pet and not even bother, however
I've not found all of those word either.  I hunted in Netherbian last night
for several hours with my Shaman and looted 5 pages of Tasarin's Grimoire
but only one word.

I seem to remember when I was levelling my rogue in Highpass/keep that a lot
of words would drop there.  I was thinking of giving it a try.  Any other
suggestions????
