I'm wondering why you would bother when it's easier just to walk into range
of the mobs.

Let the bard build up a nice swarm and get solid aggro from them, then just
wander through aggro range with two friends.  They changed the rules a while
back, if there are four PCs on the aggro list, the mobs ignore any charmed
pets and go for the charmer's jugular.  Since the essence of charmkiting is
to keep the mobs on your charmed pet until it's almost dead, then break the
charm and finish it off, by putting four people on the aggro list the
charmkite is broken - even the mob the charmed pet is on will run after the
bard.

Just be ready to zone as soon as the bard does, since if you ARE on the
aggro list that train will be coming for  you right after the frustrated
bard heads for greener pastures.
