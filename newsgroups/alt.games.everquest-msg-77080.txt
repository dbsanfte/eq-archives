Three skills at the archtype for meleers look overpowered (or at least
make the distinction for warriors just that much more pronounced).

Durability, Agility and Stability.

Basically, we increase the total hps of a warrior by 10%.  Decrease
the damage taken by warriors by 10%.  And increase the rate at which
mobs miss by 10%.

Combined this with Defensive (if they stack), and I have to ask just
what the fuck kinda mob did they put in that requires this much damage
"mitigation"?
