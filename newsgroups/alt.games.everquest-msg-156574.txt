We did him recently with I think 4 groups. We all hit him with
everything we had within seconds of the MA being shroomed. No healing,
no curing, just Hurt The Dragon till he died.
I don't think he got off a second AE.
Afterwards: cure cure cure cure cure cure now now now now now and a
couple rezzes, but most of the raid force survived. 
(Our minty fresh guild was having a crisis last weekend and we were
wondering if that bard fight would be our final big fight together,
and we almost called it off due to too small a raid force. We decided
that if we were going out, we'd go out with a bang, conjured up some
extra friends, and won :) We're nowhere near out of the woods yet, but
things are going much better than they were 7 days ago.)
