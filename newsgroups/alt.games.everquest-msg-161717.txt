You know... That is the one case I saw of the media giving a republican a 
worse rap than he deserved.  Now politically, I almost completely disagree 
with Quayle.  But I thought most of the quotes he was given the most shit 
over were obviously rather clever jokes (or horrible puns) that the media 
just obstinately refused to get.  Like the speaking Latin in Latin America 
one.  And the bit about Samoans being happy campers was insensitive, but I'd 
heard the expression 'happy campers' quite a bit, and used it myself, and the 
media was continuously going on about 'WTF does that even _mean_?'

But of course, that doesn't change the fact that he's an idiot.  I disagree 
with him politically, after all.

Yeah, that's about how I saw the days following 9/11.  I was rather confused 
by his sudden surge in approval rating.
