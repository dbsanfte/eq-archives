Yes and when it ripostes, kicks, bashes, it takes damage.  Plus it
hits more than once per combat round.  I picked once per second
because it is easy math.  If it doesn't hit you in some way, an
average of once per second, it probably isn't *that* much less.

I decided to take a look at some LDONs and just count the number of DS
hits in a couple fights.  Turns out that they were hitting about .66
times per second.  This is not scientific but it gives us a ballpark. 
So let's say the numbers above should read 30 DPS and 1800 damage per
minute.

Uh, the DS adds DPS.  Where did you turn this in to the DS being all
of the DPS?  Put it this way.  Would you rather do 100 DPS on a mob or
130 DPS on a mob?  Considering that many people will pay hundreds of
thousands of plat in order to get an extra 20 or 30 DPS,  (adding
haste, better ratio weapons, etc) I think that the added 30 is pretty
damn nice.  Hoy much would people pay for a droppable, 40% haste item?
 200k?  500k?  The best droppable haste items available add 36% haste.

My Ranger does about 125 DPS, according to Yalp, with an elemental bow
and 194 AA's.  He does around 80 with a Staff of the Four Winds. 
(offensive melee AAs are not yet maxed)  Let's just assume we have a
reasonably high level haste spell on him, so he is 100% hasted.  If I
drop swiftwind and we assume that I lose all 40% of that haste
(meaning I only had a 60% haste cast on me--Vallon's is 68%), I will
lose 20% of my DPS.  Just simple math.  (100% haste gives your attacks
a 200% weighting.  60% haste gives them a 160% weighting.  160/200 =
80) In other words, I would lose about 25 DPS by dropping a 40% haste
item.  So I think it's clear that for a fairly high-DPS character, a
several-hundred-thousand plat item will still only improve DPS by
about as much as that damage shield.  For a Knight or Warrior, that
item will rarely even accomplish that much.

If you get hit once every *six* seconds, that 45 DS is a 45 HP/tic
dot.  If you get hit 4 times every 6 seconds, which is what I counted
on just a few mobs, thats a 180 hp / tic dot.

500 a hit, average, sounds awfully high unless this is a very high end
zone.  And since a group would never rely on a DS to do all of its
damage, the fight won't be lasting 7 minutes.
