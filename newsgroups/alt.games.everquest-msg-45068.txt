You don't have to though if you have a burner. I burned my
EQ/kunark/velious DIR onto 2 cd roms. I just reformatted a while back
and had it dumped back in the dir in 10 minutes. Having it like that
is nice, even though its a couple month old burn now, when I log in it
only takes a few minutes to patch it up. 

Eq has no registry settings so its no problem. Nice because all my
*.opt and ini and such files are burned too.
