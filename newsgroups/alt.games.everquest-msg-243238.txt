---------------------------


The Graveyard zone, Shadowrest, is now live!

We have introduced the new graveyard zone, Shadowrest, to the live
servers.  The zone will allow adventurers whose corpse has decayed,
after 7 days, to retrieve it.  They will merely have to greet the
appropriate NPC in one of the following zones to activate their
transport to Shadowrest;

East Commonlands
The Plane of Knowledge
Toxxulia Forest
Qeynos Hills
The Feerrott
Butcherblock Mountains
The Field of Bone
Shadeweavers Thicket
Misty Thicket

We hope you enjoy this new addition to EverQuest!
