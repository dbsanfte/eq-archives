Flame lick. If they're aggro resistant, tangling weeds. Immolate also
works. Stinging swarm, not so hot - probably better to keep swinging
really.

If you dont have a nuker, root also works. Tell the bard and other ranger
to stay further away than you and stand close enough to kiss it, occasionally
rerooting. (Oh ebony bladed longsword, I miss you!). 

It'll hit the nearest thing - and thats you. Keep flame licking though,
if root breaks you want it staying near you, not the cleric.

A ranger really really should be able to hold aggro. Do you have haste? What
weapons were you using? We're some of the most taunty tanks in the game
all the way up, and at 42 you should be about as tanky as an equivilantly
geared plate class.

Blech ;( There was no pacify that was worth using when I was those
levels so my experience is all unresitable harmony, sorry ;(

I used to have a LUV ME hotkey when I played in karnors to save enchanters
from the inevitable trains. I think it went something like
taunt
kick
disarm
beg (I now dont think this works with attack on, cant remember)
snare

and then I would throw in flamelicks if I thought that the dot wasnt
going to be an issue. Really though, make sure you stand close, that
you only taunt when you dont have aggro, not when you do, and use
your debuffs like flamelick and immolate, which they hate ;)

Try getting some procs on your weapons too with stuns - were you using
call of (sky? Fire? lightning? Whatever rangers get nowadays), and
throw augments on them or get proccy weapons from the bazaar.

Also - make sure your peers are standing as far back from the mob as they
can and still be in melee range and that they know YOU are the only
snarer/dotter of the main target. I.e. Mr Bard can slow if required, but
really you want minimal aggro generated by anyone else who's standing
near in melee range.
