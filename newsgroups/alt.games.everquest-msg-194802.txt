How long does it take you to figure out whether the loggin server is
down or just overloaded with people after a patch?

Exactly. It's really quite simple, almost nothing pisses me off more
than a company that wastes my time for no good reason. It's a trivial
fix to actually let the user know whether the patch server is
overloaded or down but SoE just doesn't care. Me, I get around it by
not trying to log in on patch day until well after a patch is supposed
to be complete and I know people are already online.

If I made a habit of flaming SOE you might have a point. As it is, I'm
just hurt that some nameless usenet idiot doesn't think highly of me,
Hopefully, given a lot of time and therapy I'll get over it.
