Aye, Jonah, couldn't think of his name.  My map shows him as the "friendly"
hermit... referencing the (false) fact that he attacks everyone.

At any rate, I wasn't looking for a tough mob that I could take with effort
(the hermit in SK) but rather one that my pet could solo without me being
there at all.  One of the joys of being a pet class is that you can
automatically
suck up exp... slow but sure and effortless.... if you can locate a mob
like this one is supposed to be.

Mob must be:
Killable by your pet absolutely reliably
Predictable spawn location
No wanderers nearby
Killable by your pet before it runs out of exp range (earth pets have the edge
here)
Spawn rate slow enough that your pet is back at full health again before repop

And (this is the one I'm out of luck on here) must aggro either you or your
pet

The hermit in SK would

Kill my pet if I didn't help
Mean occaisional wandering lions which would aggro... at the wrong time, kill
pet and
then me
Not aggro... need to say key phrase or use AOE attack spell to hit him to get
him going.

Any other ideas?
