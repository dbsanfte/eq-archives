Uh... did you read my follow-up posts??? If you had bothered to do so, you
wouldn't have opened your mouth, because you would have seen that A) I WAS
using my brain (do you use yours, in addition to your mouth?) and B) I
understood what the fuck I was talking about, as you evidently did not. Hey,
I discussed the need for help on a problem I thought I was experiencing, and
I do NOT need your wise mouth, "frank" or not. Don't insult before you
actually see a reason to do so. And please get a grammar text so that you
don't confuse 'your' with 'you're'. Oh, and along the way, you might pick up
a text on punctuation.

I certainly understand how my spells work. I know what they do. That was
part of the entire problem, as you would have seen, had you taken the time
to read the rest of the posts in the thread, and not rashly jotted off a
note to me on my lack of brains.

Thanks for the advice... I might take it, were it not for your smart
attitude.
