The bricks and blocks can be broken down to pieces with smithing skill... and I
hear with a recent patch there is a forge added down there now.  This means
instead of backpacks full of 18 lb blocks, you can make stacks of 20 pieces

Now if they'd only put a forge in Skyshrine, where I'm hunting at the moment...
killing off everyone around the bank so I can use it is no better than a
temporary solution
