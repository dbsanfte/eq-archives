    Mobs have close to the same HPs as Normal mobs. The change is the DPS -
they now double and triple for 900's. The pulls aren't so bad, you can
usually single or double. If you find a mob for an enchanter to charm,
you're off to the races - now that double-or-triple 900's is on your side.
Miragul's is good and bad for this. Good, in that if you get a charmed
monkey he'll usually cast spells when Charm breaks, giving you time to
re-charm. But bad in that the damned caster monkeys also buff themselves
with the INT caster self-buff line with added MR after you've charmed them,
making breaks more likely.

    Our elemental/time geared groups can clear a Hard slaughter without a
charmed pet, but we take a little over a minute per kill including pull
times (so 70-75 mins per mission). Our usual composition is ENC, DRU, CLR,
ROG, NEC, and some random plate tank, so it's not like we're optimized for
DPS until we find George (the monkey pet). We do have excellent healing
support, though, which I think would be a requirement, as would an ENC to
supplement DPS. If your support staff is sitting at FT 15, and casters have
all necessary spells, I'd say it's doable. So VT or high Ssra/Bazaar-level
players?

    The minis really make it worthwhile, BTW. We've had to let some really
nice stuff rot because it was No Drop. They only hit in the 1300's at most,
so if you can pull them single you can kill them. Just be very, very careful
with the casters - one Gate and you're going to wipe.

    James
