If its a discipline (tome hotkey) the syntax is /disc name (eg /disc 
Mock, for a warrior to burn away endurance fast while grabbing 
additional aggro)

If it's an activated AA (e.g. Rampage) the syntax is /alt activate #, 
where # is the EQ internal reference code for the AA.

A good list of these (not sure how complete or current it is) can be 
found at
