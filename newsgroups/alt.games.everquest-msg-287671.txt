cause your damaging spells to sometimes inflict a painful curse.
Requires a level 60 or higher item. (Black Magic -- 209 to 231 Shadow
damage every 3 sec.)
Enchant Weapon - Accuracy -- Permanently enchant a melee weapon to
increase critical strike and hit rating by 25. Requires a level 60 or
higher item.
Enchant Ring - Stamina -- Permanently enchant a ring to increase
Stamina by 24. Only the Enchanter's rings can be enchanted, and
enchanting a ring will cause it to become soulbound.
Most of the tanks who went enchanting because of the special skill: +4
all ability (only the enchanter=92s rings can be enchanted). Now here
comes the new crazy skill, increase stamina by 24!
