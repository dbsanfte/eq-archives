I am curious.  What level is Precia, and where are you fighting?

I generally only die to extreme stupidity when solo I Kaev (L53), and
gain exp about half as fast as in a good group (twice as fast as a bad
group).  Of course, I do most of my soloing in Lower Guk, where the
mobs don't have too many HP, but I've soloed in Trak's Teeth with some
success as well (better exp per mob, but they take longer to kill).

My gear is far from uber, and the key piece of gear is easy to acquire:
Deepwater Helm (four casts of Daring per Root, ignoring breaks).  Beyond
the Helm all that really matters is getting AC up and having a decent
weapon and a Haste item.

If you've run into some sort of a roadblock at higher level than me I'd
sure like to know where it is, so I can start to look for some way to
mitigate it.  A lot of my play time is subject to random distractions
from RL, so I solo frequently of necessity.  If it weren't for the
Velious and post-Velious enhancements to Paladin soloability, I'd either
be playing a Druid as my main by now, or have quit the game.
