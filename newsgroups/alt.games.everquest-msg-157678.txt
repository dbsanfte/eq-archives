No just that any time <ANY> change is made to EQ some troller
digs out that old pos article and waves it around like some red flag
to a bull. Sorry we ain't jumpin'

Holy shit they are whimping EQ! Yet its still the most popular MMORPG
and still growing and people are still playing it. Year after year trollers
come into this newsgroup and wave that article around predicting EQs
imminent downfall. Still waiting...

Any second now...

Yup any second now...

Nothing lasts forever and EQ will one day go poof! But by all the nay-sayers
predictions EQ should have never made it out of beta.
