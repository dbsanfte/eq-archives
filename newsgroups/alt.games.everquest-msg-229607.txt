I did that once, they didn't stop billing me though. I'm sure it was a 
glitch and not the norm though... of course, in typical SOE form, they 
then suggested that I note the TOS says they do not refund subscription 
fees when I asked that they reimburse me for the months *after* I 
cancelled... this didn't get resolved until I wrote to MasterCard 
advising them that SOE was making fraudulent charges on my card. (And 
then suddenly they were much more cooperative...)
