From a somewhat different perspective.... My 41 bard currently has two
options for regaining mana: standing (1/tick) or sitting (2/tick).  FT1
would make a *huge* difference in how fast his mana comes back.

Also, my 30 mage can stand (1/tick) or sit (~14/tick). FT1 wouldn't make a
big difference if she was sitting all the time. But she's only sitting
about half the time in dungeons anyway (aggro, running to next mob, main
looting, etc) so I'd think it would help a fair amount.

Remember, not everyone runs around with the full smorgasbord of raid-level
mana buffs and the all-bard Bristlebane Tabernacle Choir singing mana
hoseannahs at them.

I just this morning picked up my first FT item ever -- an Earring of the
Solstice for the iksar necro (3 cheers for Sand Verbena and Goblin Bones!).
It'll be interesting to see how much of a difference that makes.
