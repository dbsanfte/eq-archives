Fabian at the Grub and Grog Tavern will raise your KoT, LoAB, but it hurts
your ring of scales. he is a bard but he is blue to a 26. as a Iksar monk I
could run in FD behind him, hit sneak the hand him 2gp at a time, 500 gp
later you will be non Kos to the bards but I killed allot of orcs in the
commons that give KoT so I'm not sure how much gp you will need. hope it
helps
