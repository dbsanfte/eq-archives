I downloaded the EQCaster program a few months ago, and it was working great! 
Until I opened another eff file.  Some of you have probably done this
before...everything gets all messed up.  So the website said all you had to do
was open spdat.eff.  I did that, and it gave me a long list of spells, but they
were all messed up.  Total gibberish.  Says stuff like "Druids get it at level
0 and monks get it at level 250!"  I tried several things, such as deleting
spdat.eff, and doing the patch, but so far, nothing has worked.  Can anybody
offer any suggestions?  Thank you very much!
