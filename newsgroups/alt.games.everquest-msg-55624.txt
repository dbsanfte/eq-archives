Basically what I have seen is any level 14 or lower MoB that is not a named
MoB. I have been able to play everything from a Decaying skell to a level 14
Kobold in Warrens. Warriors, Wizards, Monks and Shamans are what I have
played so far. Great to play an Orc Centurion in GFay. Lots of low level
players to harass there. =)
