Hey, I just found the quote function still floating about on Google

You make a good and valid point, and I agree that a limited-use,
limited acquisition item, such as the XP potion, would have been more
apropriate and desireable as a gimme.  However, while the Festive Doll
and coin have just ousted a good chunk of otherwise must-have content
for many characters, they are also only being made available for a few
weeks.  Once they are gone, they're gone (untill the 7th anniversary
gimme comes around, and the stats for the festive doll and
commemorative coin change once again), so anyone who missed out, for
whatever reason, during this time do not get them.

And it may yet turn out that, like many of last-years free gimme's,
once the festivities are over the freebie loses all of it's attribute
bonuses.  We'll just have to see.  If they keep the stats, then I will
be in complete agreement with you as regards to them not being a very
well thought out gimmes.

Xiphos - And then there are those who are so self-absorbed in their own
Uberness that they blithly pay upwards of 5K plat for that stupid doll
in the bazaar, further throwing the EQ economy into chaos because they
can't be bothered to read MOTD's and notices.
