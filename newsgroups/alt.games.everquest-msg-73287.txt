It seems to me that with a site run by a person rather than a company,
this is just a matter of accounting, since they still are running at a
loss, even with donations.

That is, it can either be thought of as:

	1. They spent $100 of donations to buy more RAM for their
personal computer, and did not cut back the amount of their own money
that goes into the site, or

	2. They spent $100 of their own money to buy more RAM for
their personal computer, because $100 of donations reduced the amount
they were spending on the web site.
