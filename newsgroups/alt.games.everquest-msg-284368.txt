I noticed this as well and to tell you the truth I don't see it
something that should be changed.  First of all, clearing those buffs
is easy enough with a dispell (uncharmed).  Second, they don't do that
much, particularly as mobs get higher level.  (Conviction doesn't mean
much when the mob has 50k hitpoints to start with)  Third, you have
control of him.  Why shouldn't you be able to do with him as you
please?

Now if only you could click off his charm as well...
