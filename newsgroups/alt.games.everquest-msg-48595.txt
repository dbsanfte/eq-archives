What they did was replace Jakum Webdancer with
!Jakum Webdancer.

That is what irritated me. The starts of the
quest (in Felwithe, Kaladim and by the docks)
are still working. The end is not. If Verant had
a clue, they would have nerfed Tacar Tissleplay
and his cohorts, instead of Jakum. As it is,
you're promised things that do not happen and
that irritates me as a player regardless of
whether or not my role playing hat is on. Also,
as a bard, the faction adjustments are actually
more important than the money.

Having said all that, the Freeport-Kelethin mail
quests still work. Idia and Ton Twostring still
give out gold, exp and faction for delivering
their mail. I'm hoping the Freeport-Highpass
quest is still good, for when I get Selo's.
