    Jakiss will eventually get his revenge, and I bet in grand style. We
went to CoM recently to get a new guildmember shaman his epic. All the time
we were being warned by the shaman, "His AoE is nasty. It's ugly. Better
have a bunch of people ready. Mages, you got those fire pets ready? Clerics,
ready to res Dachunker (7500 HP main tank) back in?" The Tear was turned in,
and six seconds later a wizard manaburn crit for 16000 damage snuffed
Rak'ashir. One of the fire pets hadn't even been send in to attack yet.
