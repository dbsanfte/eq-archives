I have Sun Vortex ready for level 65.  Someone was trying to sell it in the
bazaar at 30K.  It wasn't selling, so he dropped it to 20K.  Then suddenly 3
other copies showed up and the price went down to 15K, which was just about
the amount I had in the bank.  Right now, Black Steel is working great for
my situation, which is LDoN.  The chanter is tashing the mobs anyway, so
Black Steel is hitting well without me having to use mana debuffing.  I get
a lot more resists when I try to throw in a fire based nuke.  I'll be happy
when I get to 65 and have both as an option against mobs with high resists
against one or the other.
