When I'm playing my cleric I cringe when a ranger joins the party because I
_know_ where most of my mana is going from that point onwards.  The ranger does
a lot of damage and moves right to the top of the hate list and I end up mana
dumping on him to keep him alive.

That said, my highest level melee class is a ranger at level 21.

Him.
