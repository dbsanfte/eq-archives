Not that safe in his room, i been helping a few times when guildies 
needed key, and one of the times, a spider had spawned right next to 
him, and we got attacked as the person in question handed in the key, 
and Jaled Dars Shade threw a DT on me. Luckily the rogue made it out, 
and dragged us to entrance for rezzes.
