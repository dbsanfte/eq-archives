EQ does indeed use the umbra technology for ALL its zones not just LUCLIN,
that was one of the major reasons to move to directx 8.1 when luclin
shipped, UMBRA needed it.  You could tell the difference because my friend
used a 500mhz AMD K6-2 after luclin had shipped (he still used the deluxe
edition, so he never purchased luclin) and his frame rates fell through the
floor, however as soon as we turned off UMBRA it went back to the usual
framerates, a perfect indication the UMBRA was definetly in use (even
without luclin installed).  I did post a message ages ago in this forum and
a lot of people replied with good messages, saying my fix had worked
perfectly ( i originally posted it on the everquest boards at sony ).

Theres a breif description over at www.nillbase.com/eq.htm
telling you how to do the above, turn of luclin and restore the games
framerates to normal (the old world that is, luclin still tends to slow
down)

Bottom Line is UMBRA is broken, its a technology that dosent work, has never
worked, and something they are STILL trying to fix.  If you dont believe me,
and im sure some of you wont.  Then why is it my friend with his 500mhz K6-2
and me with my 1.4 Ghz Athlon, can get more than double the framerates when
we turn of umbra technology?.
