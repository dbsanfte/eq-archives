L50 is a Noob guide, not a GM who can move inventory items and issue
temporary bans or warnings on accouts. I believe the guides are given a
level past 50 for every 6 months they manage to last in the guide
program without ripping their eyes out with forks.

Guides are generally just as frustrated with having the petitions they
excalate to real gms ignored as the players are at never getting any
service.
