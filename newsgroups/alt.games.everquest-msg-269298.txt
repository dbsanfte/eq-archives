You need software that will map the controls to keys... I know Logitech 
and Microsoft's controls both have the ablility to do that.

I had a friend that used to *try* to play EQ with a gamepad... seemed 
like a lot of pain for a negative gain (he was sloppy with it).

But he was a nintendo'er at heart.

Fubar end of that story is he refuses to play FF Online because he is 
po'd at Squaresoft for ignoring his precious nintendo.

(and it can be played quite handily from a gamepad, I am led to understand)
