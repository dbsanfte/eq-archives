Then the newbie attacks a guard (or drowns if he was "fooled" by
NTO-gen), suffers 0 to negligible xp loss, drags his corpse over to
the bank and converts his 1,000,000 copper into plat.  I guess you
really showed him. :-)

Seems like every time a "those damn beggars" thread turns up, at least
one person presents the idea of overloading them with copper, and at
least one presents the "type /d for donation" trick.

When they try to pass these tired pranks off as original ideas in
thread after thread, it becomes more annoying than the beggars we're
all complaining of.  ;-D
