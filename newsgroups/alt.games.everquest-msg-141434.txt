So after a few months away from eq I thought I'd dust off my rogue and see
where I left him off.  Turns out he was in OverThere.  I hunted there for a
bit in a group, got bored and split back to mainland to give lower guk a
shake.  The rogue is level 31, I meet up with a warrior, druid and a wiz and
we did the spider room / bedroom area.  It went well until warrior pulled
the wizard ledge or something and we got a slew of froggies.  Our wiz did
evac, but unfortunately the tank bit it.

Well that was my exciting introduction paragraph, now for some generic
stuff.  When I was in guk with these guys, it was pretty darn empty, only
around 20 people or so and this was on a Sunday ~12pm CST.  Is it always
this dead?

Any hints on soloing here as a rogue in the event I can't find a group in
the future?  I remember the old days pre Kunark, this zone was bursting at
the seams with people, now they all split from the mainland.  Pikers...

I'm not really after phat lewts or anything (at least yet), rather I'd like
to get a bit more XP under my belt.

Yeah my friend was yesterday the only person in Lguk for 1,5 hours orso.. He
managed to get his Thick Banded Belt very easy. Hes a 52 pally and was
camping the supp alone.
There are more area's now that have also nice loot so it's evenly spread out
more now.
