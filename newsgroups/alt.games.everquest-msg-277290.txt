A friend and I were talking about that upcoming D&D MMORPG, and an 
article he read and was telling me about from the developers, on the 
problems of adapting the D&D system to an MMORPG.

While discussing this, I had an interesting idea for a spell or ability: 
Foresight.

Here's how it would work.  You cast Foresight before a fight 
(particularly before boss fights), which is a group spell.  Every member 
of the group is told that they feel a vision coming on, and asked if 
they accept the vision.  If they all do, for the next N seconds (higher 
level Foresight would have a larger N), the party's actions take place 
in the vision, not in the real world.

So, the party uses Foresight, and attacks the boss.  When the vision 
ends, the party is back to where it started--nothing was real, no one is 
dead, the mob is not dead, no loot was won.  The fight was not real.

However, if the party attacks the boss for real, within a short time 
after the end of the vision, the real fight will match the vision (if 
the party members act the same way for real that they did in the vision).

Basically, the server records the sequence of choices made by the 
players during the vision, and the decisions made by the mobs, and the 
results of random events such as to-hit rolls and damage, and then, 
during the real fight, compares the real fight to that record.  As long 
as the players' choices match the record from the vision, the server 
makes the mob choices and the random events match.  If a player deviates 
from the vision record (casts the wrong spell, for example), the mobs 
and random rolls are no longer constrained by the vision record.

So, if you see victory in your vision, then you just have to do the same 
thing, and you will win.  If you see defeat in your vision, and choose 
to fight anyway, you can follow the vision up until your first fatal 
mistake, and then avoid that.

I think this could be a fun spell.
