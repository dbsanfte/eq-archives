Point is though, until nToV (ancient wyvern-hide) armour, thats the best
monks can get.  (most(all??) monks go for a fungi for BP, even tho the stats
means it gives less AC than whats listed on it, even, because of negative
stats)

We got fucked over early on in kunark: warriors had cobalt, rangers had
their tolans, rogues in their mylokars, SK's had bloodember, paladins had
DW, bards had SS, monks had CRESCENT armour.  Theres not a single piece of
crescent armour that a twink would wear now, the stats and ac were so
apallingly low

Planes level (shiverback) armour was an equal joke,  velious quest armour
was a slap in the face.  no self-respecting monk would wear that absolute
pile of shit, it wasn't worth the cost of the gems needed to quest it

ANY monk not in an ntov capable guild has jack shit for AC, id go as far as
to say if your not in an ntov capable guild your armour SUCKS ASS as a monk

Btw Dearic, do you remember old days PoA raids?  Spiroc and mage epic isle
in particular?  When monks had so many fucking corpses if you piled them on
top of each other you could have built a ladder to Luclin!

> And I have about 600 ac naked... I doubt a monk has less.

Maybe not, but when have you seen a monk do something effective whilst
naked?

As an unrelated story.. when we die on raids (lots of us bound in bazaar
arena) a totally naked warrior who gets a banked weapon will easily lay the
smack down on me, goes for a guildie paladin too
