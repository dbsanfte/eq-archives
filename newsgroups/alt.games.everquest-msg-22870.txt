I recently decided to play a character on the new Sullon Zek server. I
started a rouge, but wasn't having much fun with him. So I deleted him
and started Necro. Same thing. I didn't have much fun, so I deleted
him. Last I made a Magician. I got him to 4th, when it hit me what I
really wanted to play. So I deleted him and tried to make an
Enchanter. I can't make it for some reason. I waited an entire day to
make sure that it wasn't still seeing my last character as being
available, but no dice. Is there like a 3 character limit or something
on that server? I know they limited it so that only 1 character can be
created on any given account (I think I read that somewhere, and after
creating one char, every other character is rejected on the basis of
name unless I delete the first one first). If I've created and deleted
3 characters, am I now unable to ever play on the Sullon Zek server?
Cause that would SERIOUSLY suck. Thanks.
