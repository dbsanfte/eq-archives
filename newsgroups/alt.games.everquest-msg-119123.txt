Just to pick a nit, Conquest never woke the Sleeper.  The GM observing
them killed Ventani(?) just before he summonned them to Arena for their
collective ass-chewing, and that is what woke the Sleeper.  (not aimed
at you personally biz, this is at least the third post I've read
recently referring to them waking the Sleeper, they never did it, and
afaik they never killed the fourth warder, I believe it was their
first try  that was aborted because they were observed "cheating" on
the attempt).

And it was after summonning the guild members who were on the aborted
raid that the GM was talking to them on their guild chat channel.
