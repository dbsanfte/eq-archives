From the shadows, the mysterious Sean Kennedy <x@n.n> (if that IS his
real name) conspiratorially whispered:

It's so true! Though I must admit few people on test are complaining
about the stuff that so many prods now seem to be mentioning as
problems, or were.

But that said theres a number of things (the sky for instance) that
were NEVER put on test, we got them the same time as the prods did.

It will be awfully hard to leave all the people and the
accomplishments of EQ behind. It's great being an elemental ranger on
test and doing that sort of stuff. And I can just imagine what the WoW
playerbase is going to be like, knowing battlenet and all. But that
said I can see myself moving games once the time comes....
