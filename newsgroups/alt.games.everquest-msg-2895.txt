That may have been true a while ago, but Verant is adding all kinds of
'specialty' fish. Now, most zones do NOT drop fresh fish, they drop something
like Surefall Carp or Thunder Salmon or Bony Fish. Currently, many of these fish
are NOT directly edible and do not work with known recipes. Plus, there is the
advantage of being able to get experience by hunting bears, cats etc while
getting food, while fishing is a void.
