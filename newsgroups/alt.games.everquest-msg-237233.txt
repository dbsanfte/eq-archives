}Actually, all those things you mention are simply sub-sets of the

True, and so many amateur hedonists fail to note that sometimes, foregoing 
pleasure now is necessary to maximize pleasure throughout your lifetime.  
You can party, drink, smoke, and philander all you like, but if you pace 
yourself, and balance it with doing things that make other folks want 
to party with you, you can do it -much- longer. :)
