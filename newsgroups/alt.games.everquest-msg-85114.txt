It will work better if you instead get a lil 75 dollar linksys router,
have that plugged into the ethernet line from the cable modem, have
the two computers netcards plugged into ethernet cabled connected to
that router. It kind of sets itself up.

Just to be sure do a net search and find which router will work with
your cable modem ISP, type of cable modem, etc before buying it.
Running with one computer being your router is not really needed and
at best makes the connection kind of fudgey.
