   Pretty much true.  I was about to respond to a post with questionable logic
the other day, till I notice the author was Faned.  I don't have him manually
killfiled, but I do know better than to respond to his bait.  I'm not trying to
tell you want to do, Ben, but this is the same guy that says it a deplorable act
to play God and have a cat neutered, but eating meat is A-OK.  I can't judge how
much you value your time, of course, but you would probably get further arguing
with a cat.
