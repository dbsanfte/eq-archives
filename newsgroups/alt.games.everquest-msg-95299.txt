Thank you for the names, but I am probably gonna lose more time on
the debate as I would need to make some nice xp and get
quest gem drops. :(
Got - unintentionally (except one , maybe) - trained 6 times this saturday,
3 times wizzies, 3 times druids, everytime because they couldn't
control their 4some pull - I heard excuses like
'But they never aggro on people...' after they pulled them right over my pet
fighting some wyvern/drake.

*sigh* - Cobalt Scar could be such a nice zone...

Thanks again & cu,
