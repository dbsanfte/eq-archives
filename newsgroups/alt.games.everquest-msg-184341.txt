Sorry David, did not really intend it as flame bait.  Let me try
to explain...

As with any skill, to sing well you need feedback that allows you
to judge what you're doing.  It is, for most people, very difficult
to really hear yourself sing (i.e. to hear yourself as others hear
you).  On top of that, many people cannot hear musical pitch and
intonation accurately, even from outside sources, without quite a
bit of training.  Both of these abilities, hearing pitch/intonation
and hearing yourself, are trainable for most people (i.e. they are
skills).  However, there are some people who are blessed with a
very substantial innate ability in these areas, they need little or
no training to do them well, it "comes naturally" to them.  This
allows these lucky folks to develop substantial skill at singing at
a very young age, some of them become very good singers with no
outside help to speak of.  Others, like me, start out life with no
special aptitude for hearing musically, and so are absolutely
horrible singers until/unless they train first their hearing (the
hardest class I had in college was Ear Training, even after 6 years
of fairly serious musical study prior to it), and then their voices.
I can now sing a very passable bass in a choir, and people no longer
grimace, shout me down, and/or flee when I sing solo.

So, as with anything else, people are born with varying aptitudes
and potentials for the skills required to make music.  Those who
have good aptitude and high potential can become quite good at
singing at a very young age simply because no tools are required
to exercise and practice the skill.  It's easy to vocalize, and it
doesn't tire you, so even a toddler can practice for hours on end
on a daily basis.  It's no more magical than anything else in life
tho, anybody who's hearing and voice are not crippled can become a
singer.  Some start life with advantages that virtually guarantee
that they will become good at singing unless prevented, just as
nearly all of us become good at walking unless we are prevented.

Having studied music for years in my youth, I simply couldn't allow
the absurd assertion that singing is not a skill pass unchallenged.
