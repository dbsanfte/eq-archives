THERE IS THE PROBLEM!

There is no such thing as a decent OOC conversation. USe the channel,
or take it to tells. OOC should be short things people in zone should
ALL need to hear, not chat like "my girlfriend is ..." or "Hitler was
smart..." that may be Out Of Character, but DONT ASSUME the rest of
the zone cares or wants to hear it.

You will find it more effective to use /ooc for shoprt OOC things, and
tells or /join talk:talk
