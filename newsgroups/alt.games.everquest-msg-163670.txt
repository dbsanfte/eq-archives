Meh.  My requests:

- auto equip box for your bank account.  it would make it so, so, SO
much faster to manage your bank space with that.
- add a feature to say "you have no more room for that" for both bank
space and personal inventory space, so when you put something in the
auto equip box, it doesn't just fall to the ground, it gets put back
on your cursor, where it belongs.
- find SOME way to be able to search for AC better in the bazaar.  At
least they put in "sort by stat", which I haven't tested yet, but
which I've been wanting for awhile.  Like someone in an earlier thread
stated, being able to search by min and max stat would make it much
more useable.
- also, it'd be nice if, when *left* clicking on a trader's name in
the bazaar box, it'd bring up that trader's entire inventory, and when
left clicking on an item, it'd bring up the results of everybody
selling that item.
- fix the UI so that when tradeskilling, you don't muddle up quite
often with getting one of the item on your cursor, lagging just a bit
in picking it up, thus replacing that stack of 19 of item b with 1 of
item a and putting the 19 in the kit to combine with something else,
at least they fixed THAT though :)
- when something is combined, it'd be nice to have it put *straight*
into inventory instead of onto your cursor.
- fix the rogue epic ;)


Ryou
