Was sitting in EC a while back, and got in an argument with a Wood Elf Druid
over the fact that ES Vambraces are handy to have, even if they're not
great. He kept saying that all ES is worthless crap, and I was trying to
point out how the Vambs can add a good 1200 damage to a root/dot fight, and
how it's a great manaless way to get rid of green adds. Then he starts
insulting halflings, spouting off that they're stupid creatures created by
VI. I told him that halflings were created by Tolkien, and he said "Who?" ..
When I told him that Tolkien created the idea of mythical worlds like
Norrath, he laughed at me and just insulted VI some more.

Needless to say, everyone around him in the tunnel was laughing at his
ignorance. ;)
