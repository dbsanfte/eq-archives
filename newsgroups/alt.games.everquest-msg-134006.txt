This is how I hunted Pixies. Giggle. Only perhaps not as impressive as level
60. But Jobober usually took them with one blow anyway. I usually seriously
giggled when Jobober lifetapped them to death. Gleefully wandering around
the tower, sitting for a count of up to four (if I counted four and was
still sitting, I was out of range, or dodged), and letting the pet handle it
all. Only time I had to make an effort was when a brownie outcast came
calling, or that damn Equestrielle. I liked the brownies. Ooo look! Fun
mindless slaughter, with XP and Chocolate too! Life was bliss.

Perhaps the sadest day in my baking career was when pixie-cinnasticks went
trivial. But that's ok, I'm almost big enough to hunt the brownie village
itself. /grin
