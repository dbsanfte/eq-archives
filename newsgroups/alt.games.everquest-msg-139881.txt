See, this is the problem with casters.  They're always in tears over 
*something*.  Okay okay, so I broke mez tonight *once* *grumble* The 
Demon of Lag was sitting on my back!

Bah.  If I ever sneak/hide over to that bitch it's gonna be for some 
serious backstabbing revenge.

Oh no, don't say that.  I've been wanting to make a trip to Halas for 
pelts and have been procrastinating looking up faction farming ideas :)  
You'd think the stupid gnolls, at least, would give you faction!

You have to keep in mind that when I'm tradeskilling, that's usually 
because I've managed to fill up my bank AND my on-me backpacks with junk 
of all kinds ;)  Plus of course I find I always always always 
underestimate the amount of water I'll want.

Bah. I take out my DELUXE SEWING KIT (that's right, I have three!  All 
of them freely given!  Mua ha ha!) when I'm ready to tradeskill :)
