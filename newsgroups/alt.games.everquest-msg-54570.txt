Things that seem to work for me.

Fight lower level mobs.

Lower the AC of mobs.

Raise your attack.

Raise your strength. (probably the most controversial of
my proposals here.  Seems to work for me, but I have no
proof)

Max out your offense.

Max out your skill in the weapon you are using.

And here's the oddest one of all:

Stop using auto attack.  When your weapon is ready,
attack and immediately turn attack off.  Wait for it to
cycle, then repeat.  Literally seems to double my hit rate.
Plus, I can forage, meditate, evade... all those skills you
can't use in combat work if you give up autoattack.
