Uqua owned compared to the tedium of Ldons and now DoN's. Yick.

I guess I'm still a raider at heart, just without the time ;(

Sure - but as raiders you (we) get say 6 hours of fun raiding for
some splendiferous upgrades and a few hours of DoN to round out.

As non raiders you get 8 hours of the Creator on repeat for some
subpar cheese.

And the whole single group argument seems moot - drops from MPG
trials, etc, while nominally single group, require strong gear to
do; chicken/egg.

I think the problem, really, is EQ as a game is trying to encompass
two seperate games with the same content; balancing wildly differing
variables and saying 'now do the same things with them'. Shrug ;)

I dont resent raiders, nor want to see them nerfed; until recently
I was one, and I know the boredom of LDoNs in time gear when nobody
would do hards and now I know the frustration of 'single group'
content without the support of a solid guild to just hop in, get a
group and go have smushy fun.

Pickup groups can be bad. Very bad. And sometimes you find yourself
wishing for even a very bad pickup group ;)
