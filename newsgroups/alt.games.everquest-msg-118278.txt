A necro in skeleton form, same situation.

DumbKitty: Hey, turn me into a skeleton please.
Me: Um, sorry...Self only spell.
DumbKitty: You're a skeleton, wolfs can turn others into wolf, so that means
you can turn me into a skeleton too.
Just do it and quit being a jerk.
Me: Well (/con DumbKitty to see that he is VERY green), if you want to be
specific, I am a form of a corpse (or it's remains).  So if you'd like to
become one of those, then I can help.
/duel
/em begins to cast a few spells
DumbKitty has been slain by Me.
/ignore Dumbkitty

Lets hope this one doesn't actually happen, though I'd not be surprised if
it did.
