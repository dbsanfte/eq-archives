I don't, and never have, blamed THE religion of Islam for the
actions of some groups.  I do, however, blame those groups'
versions.  Islam is very tolerant, probably moreso than my
own or Judaism.  That's why the Palestine/Isreal conflict is
so sad.

Those groups' versions of Islam, however, are twisted and
evil.  You CANNOT reason with them against it, and they'll
twist the Koran to make it say what they wish.  Those are
the ones to get rid of, as well as the folks that food, arm, and
shelter them.
