Something interesting that Goom pointed out, and I experimented with a 
little but not much; you can now invis with a pet up and not kill the 
pet.  Several things occur to me with this.

One, how the hell do you quickly kill a pet, especially one who's out of 
"listen to commands" range?

Two, what exactly does this mean?  Other than, I suppose, that you can 
wander thru a zone invis and not have to kill or suspend your pet to do 
it.  Can the pet fight while you're invis?  Looks like he can.  But what 
happens to aggro when this happens, which mobs do and don't get it?  Is 
this a situation where I have the invis buff visible, but really all the 
mobs in the area can see me anyway, like going invis after nuking something?

At first I was excited because I have a fixed duration invis that would 
perhaps let me wander around having my pet kill stuff with impunity, and 
only needing to find a good spot occaisionally in order to reapply the 
invis.  But then I realized, no, for the most part, I have to support my 
pet, he can't really kill stuff on his own, needs a nuke or a heal. 
Even when he can "solo" something, the down time waiting for him to heal 
back up is annoying, and if I'm FM but waiting for him, I'm really 
wasting a lot of regen potential.

I guess it might still be handy for cherry picking nameds out of green 
zones with mobs that would aggro on me if they saw me.  Not that any 
come to mind.

The whole "invis doesn't affect pet" thing strikes me as really horrible 
for bards, who relied on that effect in order to effectively charm kite, 
breaking the charm on demand so as to get exp for killing their former 
pets.  And since a couple of my characters are bards, one at 57, I guess 
I might find out sometime.  Ick.
