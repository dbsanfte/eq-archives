/cast X, where X is spell gem 1 through 8 An example:

/say Things don't hurt so much when you have a thick skin.
/cast 7 (my druid's best "skin like..." spell is kept here
/wait 50 (or is it /pause? Gives the spell time to go off.)
/say That should help, dearie.

or

/em calls down divine wrath upon %t!
/cast 1 (my cleric keeps his best evocation here)
