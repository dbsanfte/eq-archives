Hi,

The information stated above is correct.  I turned in the Bag of Troll
Guts and 50 gold to Sansa Nusk, and got the lute string.  I gave Fabian
the string and he gave me the coin.

I then gave the coin back to Fabian, and he thanked me for being honest
and gave me a letter to take to Dionna.  I gave Fabian's letter to Dionna,
and she did indeed give me a "Placeholder Scroll" - Effect: Minor Healing
ALL/ALL.

Does anyone know what this scroll is?  Is it just a "placeholder" for an
item that is not yet in the game or something?  Right-clicking on it does
nothing.

Any ideas?  I can't find any way to "use" the scroll.

I am going to put it in the bank.

Any comments?  What is this item for?

Thanks.
