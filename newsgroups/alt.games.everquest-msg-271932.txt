The wizard quest requires you to kill an oracle in the BB. Problem is
his in a large group and you don't have a hope of soloing them.

Problem I have is the game is a lying so and so. The mobs colours are
so misleading. For instance, I had a quest to kill a named char last
night. He was a grey++ but he beat the crap out of me and every other
char of my level who fancied a pop at him. Yet I aced other grey++ or
equal levels in the same area.

I reckon SOE need to alter mob colours depending on the group or class.
I.e. a white for a solo wizard, blue for tank and grey for a wizard and
tank grouped.
