Camp song?

I know it from a 1988 cartoon put out by the NFB (scores 8.7 out of 10
on IMDB).

However, doing a quick search on the 'net, yes, I found a couple of
variations of the original song.  Apparently it's over 100 years old
(but I'm pretty sure the version with an H-bomb in it is more recent).

Apparently, it's actually called:

The Cat Came Back 
"A Comic Negro Absurdity Minstrel Song" 
Words and Music by Harry S. Miller (1893)
