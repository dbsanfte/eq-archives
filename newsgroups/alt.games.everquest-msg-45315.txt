I am a bit puzzled as to why Zone Alarm would be a problem for you.  I am
running win2k with Zone Alarm, with no problems at all, other than having to
allow EQ to access the internet after each update which can be a tad
difficult at times, as the popup doesn't show with EQ running.  It's a minor
hassle though that only affects me after a patch.
