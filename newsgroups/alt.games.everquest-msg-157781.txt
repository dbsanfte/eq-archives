Here are a few fights I logged in Scarlet desert last night while duoing 
with a shammy buddy. I didn't have any item haste this time, only 
celerity from shaman. Also had HoS from shaman giving a total of 232 dex 
and 147 str. These guys are undead so I get 10 damage bonus on the 
hammer. They conned dark blue to me at 56.

First two are rather typical fights, 7 procs each on them, both lasting 
a little over a minute making for about 10s between procs on average. 
Last one was a rather bad one with about half of that. 3rd fight is a 
disappointing one with only 3 procs in about a minute, thats 20s 
average. Last one is my best run for that visit to Scarlet (2.5-3 hours) 
, about 1 minute of meleeing (buffing MR before that) and I get no less 
than 12 procs, an average of about 5 sec between them. But this last one 
is very rare, I found no other fights in the log that came close.

So, if you're friend is getting a typical 3 to 5 seconds between procs I 
sure would like to know how she does it :) ..

Wanna see the logs from the entire session I could post them for you..
