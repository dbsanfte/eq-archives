They're Barbarians.  If they don't like you, you'll never change their
minds.  And you've not lost much anyway.  I once went to Everfrost - I'd
vowed to see all the places in the world and I wanted to see the snow.
Well, I saw it all right, but I never managed to make friends with the
people of Halas.  I was chased off soon enough by bigoted Barbs who're so
puffed up with their own self-righteousness that it never occurred to them
to wonder what an 'Inky' was doing so far from home...

Well, if they want bigotry and racial hatred, they can have it.  I might
have left Neriak, I might have renounced Innoruuk, but I'm still Teir'Dal,
and I can still hate.

They're only Barbarians.  Don't waste your time.
