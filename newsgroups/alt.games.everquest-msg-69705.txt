Reinstalling 98SE didn't work. reinstall and complete blank isntall. I
tried that, I wasn't totally stoned (the entire time at least).  XP is
completly more stable in everything, I've put it thru some serious
tests. No more "blue screens".  no more mysterious hangups, where even
control-alt-del won't reset.  If a winder does happen to lock up, the
"X" button in top is still active so can end the task regardless of it
thinks it locked or not.

But I'm like you, stick with 98, milk it for all its worth. I planned
on using 98 forever. Then I saw the light.  FYI its about a 3 year old
product, software and hardware has come a long way, baby.  Can you
even buy a new computer with 98 pre-installed?  My 98 disk is planted
on the shelf next to my OS/2 Warp and C-64 GEOS 5.25" floppies.

I've had programs crash in the background with xp and not bring me out
of EQ. Log and get to desktop and see a task manager up.  So thats was
what that minor lag spike was 3 hours ago.. haha

got some friends to upgrade to XP from 98, and now we can finally
group again and stay fairly safe.

XP will bomb out EQ if someone tried to print to my printer over the
network, but thats a minor thing.

Now if I can get XP installed on this TRS-80 and Amiga 500, I'll be in
dork heaven
