Stay at it.  If you like the healing aspect of it, you have just gotten
through the worst period.  Cleric does not begin to gain its power
until Level 25.  After that, you begin to pull away from other
healers.

Really, level 39 is where you really start to get popular.

Pre-24 game for cleric is pretty awful.  You are about to the point
where you can go to Cazic Thule, which is a great great dungeon.

At 23, you are just one of a ton of healers available.  At 24 this
changes and you have a power curve from 23 (below average) to 49
(arguably the most sought-after class in the game, along with
enchanter).  Hell, at 44 you actually become a good solo class, which
lasts until about level 53 or so.  But with new group xp rules, you
will have not much reason to solo.

I soloed the assassin-supplier at 44 which I enjoyed, because it was a
HUGE challenge and I just enjoyed it.

So if you like the healing you have made a good choice.  Your enjoyment
is just starting and your hard work will be rewarded.
