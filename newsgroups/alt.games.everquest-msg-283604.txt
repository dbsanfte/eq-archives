But that's the thing.  Are we gonna need to kill the toughest mob in
Skyshrine, Kael, and Thurg?  Just one?  Wake the sleeper?  There are a
lot of ways to do it and none of them are completely satisfactory if
you ask me.

What about Dain?

They may well if Aten is indeed the main "boss" of Luclin.  I never did
my shards and dont know anything about VT though.

I have to wonder if they are even going to bother locking LoY and LDON
(or should I say, requiring that they are beaten to get to GoD).  The
thing is that the raiding guilds will be rushing to be the first to do
it (again) so the minute someone says you must kill Mob_A in order to
unlock the next expansion, everyone will do it.  They would unlock LoY
and LDON in a matter of hours if they could beat Quarm.  So do they
take the server back down again and patch back in GoD?  Or do they try
to put LoY and LDON before PoP?  Or do they figure that by the time
anyone gets that far they will have sold the whole franchise to someone
else?
