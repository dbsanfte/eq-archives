Greetings,

I am playing a new alt character (Human ShadowKnight), and I am having
a terrible time getting my Defense skill to raise. At level 8 it has
only increased to 9. I twinked him with 2 +45 HP rings and a Blackened
Alloy Longsword.. No armor or AC buffs. At level 8 he has a few pieces
of leather and cloth.

Stats
Str = 85
Sta = 100
Agi = 75
Dex = 75
Wis = 75
Int = 85
Char = 80? (or whatever the base is)

I have played EQ for almost 2 years now and the only other time I had
this problem was with a Dwarf Pally I started and then quit about a
year ago. Is this problem common with SHD PAL?

Thanks for you help and adice

Cheers
