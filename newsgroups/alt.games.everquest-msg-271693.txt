I'm also on Veeshan and noticed about the same in the bazaar. Was there some 
exodus to EQ2 I didn't know about? lol

Along that line, I play both. I have met more newbies and first-time mmorpg 
players on EQ2 than ever on EQ. IMO, EQ2 is easier to play regarding UI, but 
EQ has more command options. Two different games, but I too am not seeing 
many low-levelers on Veeshan at least. This is getting difficult for my alts 
since I'm not an advocate of twinking and power-leveling (have done it, just 
ruins the flavor for me that's all). Two-cents.
