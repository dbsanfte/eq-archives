I don't know that it's "written in stone", but the general policy seems
to be that all the CS folks remain visible (i.e. not /anon) unless
there's a specific reason for it. If training of new appies is being
done, they will likely *all* go anon while the training is in progress,
but at least one will watch the queue for emergencies so you might still
get an answer. Far more often, though, you'll get times when there's
only one full Guide or above online (particularly if it's not between 3
and 10 pm Pacific time) and maybe an apprentice or two. If a lot of the
petitions are concerning claims of abuse, harassment, KSing, etc. that
one Guide may be /anon the majority of the time investigating. And if
that's the case, they may instruct the appies to go /anon to stop them
from getting flooded with tells from people who don't know enough to use
the /petition command, or think that their emergency is more important
than everyone else's.

Also, people come and go from the program, so some servers have more or
less guides available than others.

For the most part, the GM's will be on a set work schedule, as already
noted. The guides, however, will just sign up on a calendar for shifts
that fit in with their personal available time. What times those will be
depend on that person's home time zone, work/school schedule, etc. etc.
etc.  We have one on Xev that seems to *always* be online on Sunday
mornings starting at around 4 a.m until mid morning. I'm assuming she's
a Euro, but having never talked to her, that's just a guess. Basically,
for your question, if it's not between 3 and 10 pacific, it's a total
crapshoot as to whether or not a Guide is even scheduled, or if they
showed up even if they were. The upside to this is that it's not a given
that those days are Monday to Friday. In fact, that are often *not* and
they take their "weekend" in the middle of the week, so as to be
available during prime play time. So yes, outside of those times, you
may as well pay for the rez if there's nobody showing up on a /who all
GM and a petition doesn't get answered for twenty minutes or so.
