come on,  if you had played UO for all that time, you cant have
expected most Pkers to act any differently.  They are not looking for
the thrill of fighting another human being, they are looking for the
fun in wrecking another players time.   The vast majority are people
who whatever their age act in a juvenile, nasty and vindictive manner.
If PvP was managed properly, it would function on all servers.  But
until the 98% pker as jackass is changed 95% of all players will
gravitate towards the non PVP servers.

Look at the EQ server pops, or in UO the way that Felluca's population
moved the day they opened Trammel, that was funny one day heavy
population in fell cities, next day even brittania was a ghost town.
And that was a total reaction of the vast majority of players to jerk
behavior in both games.
