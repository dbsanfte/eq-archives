A more apt comparison would be if you decided to pull from east without
warning and while the designated puller is already pulling from north.  You
may be thinking the puller is pulling too slow, but then he may be thinking
the same thing and bring 3.  Then your 3 makes a wipe.  I dont mind if you
want to take over pulling, but tell me first.  I also dont mind if we open
boxes, but dont do it without warning.
