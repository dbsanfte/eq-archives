    Could be one of two things I can think of. One, we tend to spread our
loot around more regardless of play time, and I'm guessing we have more
folks than you. Two, I've been a member for just one year, so in a lot of
slots where someone might have a NToV drop or other Velious-level item, I
have something I've purchased. I don't have a Tormax belt, I have a
Bone-Clasped Girdle; I don't have that 100/100 NToV cloak, I have a Hiero.
Things like that add up quickly.

    I click it off so fast usually, I couldn't tell you what it's called.
;-) It's the level 65 SHM HP/STR/DEX buff - we got lucky early with our
level 65 spell turn-ins on that one. So far, HoV is still evading us.
