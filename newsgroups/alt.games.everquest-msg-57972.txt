You are confusing the CS key with the CS tooth.  You need a CS tooth
personally to be able to be ported to the CS wiz/druid portal.
However, to zone into CS from SS, all that is required is that at
least one person in the group have a CS key.

Hence, a Wizard or Druid only needs to have someone who has a CS key
let them into CS, and then they can go pick up a tooth in the ring,
and from then on, they can just port themselves in.
