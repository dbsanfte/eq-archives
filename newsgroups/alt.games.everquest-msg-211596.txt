I had been playing a 61 druid for about a year, and decided to make an
Iksar SK about 3 months ago. He is now level 55, and I do not play
more than 4 hours a day, and 99% solo, since I work the over-night
shift. Just have to know where to go at what level. Once you hit level
8 you can group in Kurns (trully amazing xp at that level till about
17), around 10 to try solo. Then soloed giants in Warsilks woods from
22 till 28, then Crystal Caverns till about late 30's then OT where he
now has amiable faction in the outpost. Loved the Yeti caves in DL for
about 4 or 5 levels, then BW because of the undead mobs there and fear
kiting heaven (xp slow, but ok).

I believe the nice thing though is that ALL your SKILLS will be
maxxed. I know mine are. Yes it gets tough in the 50's when others are
leveling a bit faster, but that just means you head to PoP zones or
Droga/Veksar if you can (what I have been doing).

I now only play my druid on the weekends or on some raids. Hope this
kinda helped.
