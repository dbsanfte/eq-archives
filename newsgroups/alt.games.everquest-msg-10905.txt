Con is strictly based on level, and has nothing to do with ability.

Depending on your level the specific numbers change a bit, but:
Mob's level is "well" above yours = Red

Mob's level is just above yours = Yellow

Mob is the exact same level as you = White / Black

Mob's level is below yours but will give you exp if you kill it = Blue

Mob's level is "well" below yours = Green

In your example question, when you are 4th level, 5th level mobs will be
yellow.  You ding, 5, and those same mobs will now be white/black (depending
on interface).
