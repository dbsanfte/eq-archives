Nope. Xupiter took down it's uninstaller two weeks ago. The idiots at
Weathercast did provide an uninsytaller, but it left spyware
components on the PC, five machines got them. Xupiter could not be
uninstalled, except for work on my part. LOP and Xupiter look like the
same people.

I figure it took me about three hours to get it done. Good thing it
was my time and not my bosses time.

In any case turn ACTIVEX to prompt, if it prompts you to run a activeX
control, evaluate who is sending it to you. If you know it's a pop up
deny it.
