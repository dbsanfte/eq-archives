...and you're criticizing me for insulting after you opened the post I
replied to with one?

Plus, I was responding to the snipe. Your statement was one I could
neither prove nor disprove, and given your opening, responding to it,
no matter how good an argument I could possibly formulate, would be a
waste of time. So, I didn't bother. Since I wasn't responding to it, I
snipped it.
