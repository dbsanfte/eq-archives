Giggling maniacally and surrounded by armed hamsters, "John Kievlan"
<jodakim@attbi.com> (if that IS his real name) conspiratorially
whispered:

>Ok, I think I've heard enough people screaming "This is a war for oil!"
>Here are two reasons *I* don't think this war is about oil.  Anyone who can
>seriously refute them, feel free to do so.
>
>(1)  If all we cared about is oil, why, oh why, did we call a *ceasefire* in
>Iraq at the end of the Gulf War??

Regardless of why they did not, the current administration has called
it the biggest mistake that administration ever made, so there's no
doubt had they been running the show then, they *would* have.

If you meant this to show that it wasn't about oil ("we didn't go
because it wasn't about oil!"), you accomplished the exact opposite.


>(2) If the sole reason for our involvement in the Middle East was oil -- we
>could easily assure continuous and dependable oil supplies from all Arab
>nations simply by withdrawing from the Middle East, dropping our Israeli
>allies, and letting the Arabs do whatever they want whenever they want to do
>it.  No more problem.  Yeah, maybe people like bin Laden would still hate us
>for being "infidels" but people like bin Laden don't control oil supplies.
>So why don't we just do that?  A war will cost money.

The war will *make* money for those people currently running the show,
and a *lot* of it. The war will assure future economic stability.
Remember the oil reserves are all finite. And the US would like more
safeguards on the ability of (mostly) arab countries to influence oil
prices.


>  A war will (at least
>temporarily) raise oil prices.

Think Bush and his buddies don't know that? That's part of the point!


>  A puppet regime installed by such a war will
>be only temporary, after which we'll be right back where we are now,
>oil-wise.

No. You won't have to worry about a regional power controlling it and
all the other oil there by intimidating Saudi Arabia and Kuwait away
form the US.

This isn't all that bad in and of itself, but the US has enough oil
reserves of its own to make it not worth the price in human blood it
is going to cost through this war and the decades of terrorism that
will follow it.


>  By pulling our noses out of Arab business we could have all the
>oil we want, cheaply, easily, peacefully, and without waging an expensive
>war that makes many terrorist organizations angry at us.  Why the fuck don't
>we just do that?  Unless -- this is the big one, you ready? -- unless!
>Unless, incredibly enough, we actually have *other* reasons *besides* the
>Oil God to invade Iraq!  Might that be possible?

Of course! The other reasons are personal interest and greed on the
part of some members of government, a desire to do better than daddy
to Iraq, and the fact Iraq presents a huge danger to Israel and the
Israel based lobby groups in the US are both huge and *wealthy*.


>  Naw.  Of course not.  The
>US is evil.  The US couldn't possibly have legitimate reasons for what they
>do because otherwise they wouldn't really be evil.  So they must be bashing
>everyone's heads in for fun.  Doesn't matter how much sense the arguments to
>the contrary make.

Too bad the reasons weren't the ones you thought they were, eh? Well,
you're better educated now. *If* you listen.

>
>Seriously, though, given the above reasons, does it really make sense to
>argue that the war is about oil?

Yes. Not just about oil of course. But it is a factor.


>  Or can you give me good, supportable
>reasons that despite these arguments, the US still has no logical reason to
>invade Iraq besides oil?

There are other reasons. They just aren't any better.
