I doubt it.  I figger most people just don't really care about a
fizzle when you're full mana, and resists are merely annoying when you
know you can just recast again.  But when you're trying to cast that
last, VERY IMPORTANT nuke/snare/root/DoT and you get a resist or a
fizzle, well, those moments really stick in your mind.

It's all perception.
