I think he was referring to CH-chains to fight million hitpoint mobs. Or 
more loosely the raid game in general. 

And while for particular encounters you may have to drop CH in favour of 
fast heals in one group content, you'd have a pile of downtime if that's 
all you used. In other words, the game is balanced around the assumption 
that you'll have this massively efficient heal available.
