Plus loads of quoted stuff.

In which case why the blue blazes did you quote all the religious crap
*again* and send it echoing back into Usenet? All it does is give the
original spammer more coverage, and legitimately piss off all the people
in all the newsgroups.

Thinking before posting is a good idea. It's worth trying.
