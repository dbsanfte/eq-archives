I don't know about Kerry's stance but I have a friend in the military
that deals with UN stuff (specifically what I don't know) and he has
told me that every President since the UN was established has signed
over some amount of soverignty to the UN *except* the current
President.  An example is the 2000 election, the UN was 1 week away
from coming in and managing the elections for us since we were
obviously having issues.  I only have my friends say on this but it
sure sounds plausible.

And if that's true, and I have zero reason to doubt it, that would
explain alot of the difficulties we've been having with the UN,
specifically over Iraq but it's not isolated to that.  If we're going
to take our toys and go home (or at least not share any more of them)
then they don't want to play nice.
