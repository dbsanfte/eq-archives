Untrue.  At 60, I very often get full duration roots on level 57 mobs.
And from what I have been told, druid root isn't all that fantastic.
I've seen an wizard buddy of mine get full duration roots while
NUKING.

Either way, root is one of the handiest spells in any casters kit.  It
is your friend.
