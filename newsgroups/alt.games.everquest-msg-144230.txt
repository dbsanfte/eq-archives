If EQ (or any other game) is nothing to you besides relentless
competition, then I would say that our playstyles have so little
in common that we really don't have much useful to say to one
another.  I simply cannot find enjoyment in obsessing over details
of play beyond the point where I can determine that they have an
impact on my results.
