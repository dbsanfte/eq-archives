You can't use a wizard's Gravity Flux. Same Spell, but it's Evocation for
them and Alteration for you.


I worked hard on research. Till I hit level 29. Then I just dumped points in
it. I have 83 unspent skill points, I figure that's good for any ability
they want to add to the enchanter and not grandfather in at appropriate
skill for my level.


If I was still playing I'd offer to make your spells for you, I've got a 183
research, but alas, I'm in SWG. Let me see if I can find my 'these people
will research spells for me if I bring them components' list. Unfortunatly I
found that I couldn't locate any of them when I hit 49, so I dumped a bunch
of skill points and plat (training costs after about 50).
