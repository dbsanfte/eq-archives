Hi

First, being my first time in the Grey. Nothing was near me, I could not see
nothing, but something hit me with one blast and I died at lvl 55. I
remember it said something like 'Pain and Suffering', what is this? I
couldnt see it?

Also anyone know what the Placeholder Scroll is and how it works? I got one,
but can not figure out what to do with it, now its got Combat in brackets on
it, but u cant hold it or right click to use.

Also What is a Rough Marble Statue for? Its a lore magic item, doesnt do
nothing.

thanks

Shirl
