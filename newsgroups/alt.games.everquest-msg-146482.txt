This seems very funny to me.  In real life, overcoming difficult odds
means facing very real and very serious consequences if you don't
luck out.

In a video game, what is the worst that could happen?

In EQ, I can tell you, the worst that can happen, absolute worst,
is that you can get your account revoked.  But you don't get that
for facing difficult odds.  Worst that can happen there is you
lose all your posessions and some exp.  But even that is far far
far from likely, you have to be trying something truely crazy and
then have absolutely no people skills or backup plan.

What really normally happens when you take high risks and
fail is you lose a little experience and have to spend a little
time getting your body back.  Oooh.  Yep, I'm never ever
going to risk that.  Give me real life risks, where I can spend
a week in traction, get a divorce, get thrown in jail, have
to deal with the guilt of having killed (really killed, not despawned
and cost some exp) a friend or stranger... yep, thats waaaaaay
better than video game risks.
