Great thread!  My druid normally tells them to join while I mem some
buffs for them as well, then mems circle of iceclad, and drops them off
there, and gates.  Although  I did tell one guy that most of the trading
was done at the EC tunnel, and peeps there would tend to have money, but
to find out he would have to target them and hit /d for display. . . . .
didn't hear from him again either.
