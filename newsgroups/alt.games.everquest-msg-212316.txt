This is true of all trade skills; only the very high end stuff is sellable, and
the effort it takes to get that high level plus what it takes to actually make
the stuff still means you'd have to be pretty serious about it to make more
than you could just going out and killing for a living.

The reason components sell well is the same reason that low or mid range trade
skill items sell poorly; people are working on their skill.   They too have
discovered its more profitable to go kill stuff than it is to farm lowbie mobs
forever, so they buy the lowbie stuff instead.  And then they dump their
product at whatever price they can get for it, which depresses the market down
to where its about what the vendors will pay (doesn't dip below that line
because its easier to vendor than to bazaar mule even)

The other thing creating a problem is that for most items, as you observe,
better stuff than what you can reasonably make is dropping... and the basic
concepts of Mudflation mean that even though it might be dropping for higher
level folk than your expected customer base, its being sold to your customer,
and probably for less than whatever you are selling would fetch from a vendor.

What you want to look for are items that are unique to trade skills; the
Faithstones, for example; where else can you buy a permanent secondary gate
location?  So that part of pottery will always have an outlet.  SOW potions;
sure, eventually everyone gets Run or JBoots or something, but there's an
interim period where SOW by the bottle makes sense, and there is no substitute
if you want to be self reliant.

Or go back to playing the other parts of the game and give trade skills a miss,
thats my personal plan.
