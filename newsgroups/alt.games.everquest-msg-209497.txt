But you can take your hard earned cash and go to the bazaar and get some much
better bargains.  I worked hard to get those low, medium and HQ pelts.  After
selling them I want to buy the *best* equipment I can afford.  Examples from
the Bazaar:

Fireclaw cape 30 PP
Festering Cloak 10 PP
Validus (face slot) 45 PP
Wraithbone Hammer 50 PP
Gossamer Robe 15 PP
Robe of the keeper 20 PP
Mammoth leggings 30 PP
Chipped bone necklace 15 PP
Frozen Mantle 15 PP
Strawspun belt 25 PP
Batskull earring 15 PP
Silver rose ring 5 PP
Jaded silver ring 10 PP
Large ruby (head) 5 PP

(These prices were on Seventh hammer a couple months ago when I was outfitting
my necro and my shaman friend.  I was quite impressed with the equipment we
could afford untwinked.)
