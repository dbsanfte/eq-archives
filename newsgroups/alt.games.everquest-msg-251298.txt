That would be nice to see.  I thought I read earlier, before the
patch, that they planned to create quests for these spells or
something along those lines.  Sounded like they wanted to make them
more accessible for people who haven't yet/can't progress very far in
to GoD.

The only benefits I can see are:
-People will see this as an option and assign a key to it.  I have met
people in their 60's who didn't know you could duck to instantly stop
casting.  Now more people may be able to do this.
-Ducking to stop casting may have been looked at as a work-around. 
May as well make the function "legitimate" by assigning a command for
it.
-Hybrids, casting while auto-attacking.  If you duck it will turn off
attack as well as stopping a spell.  This may be marginally better
than ducking, unducking, turning AA back on.
