I'm glad I was able to express my point...it's harder to communicate
complete thoughts in text sometimes...which was ultimately what i was
attemping to say about Spelling in EQ...the spelling my make you regard
someone a certain way but IMO shouldn't warrent disrespect.

If their actions are disrepectful as a player then "No buffs for them!" LOL

- Thanks for the enlightenment, have a great weekend!
