There is that possibility. If it is posted regularly, then perhaps a lot of
the newcomers to the group could be directed to it.

Firstly, let me say I am open to any sort of reasonable discussion as to
what a FAQ should or should not contain.

I see it not so much as a FAQ for EQ, but as a FAQ for the newsgroup. I
don't think it would or should be able to compete with the mainstream EQ
sites

Too specialised.

Links to websites will be included.

>

Too specialised

Not sure on this one, but seeing as it only takes one line.....
