I've seen a few threads asking if this is faster than that etc, so I
thought I'd throw my two copper pieces worth in.

started:

P3-450, 256M ram pc100, Matrox g450 dual head, ata33 hdd (cobbled
together clone)
	gameplay was choppy everywhere, but playable at 1024x768

added 256M ram ($46.00 US) for a total of 512M
	the slowdown in crowded zones, like the bank in Greater Faydark,
improved immensely.  video was still a little choppy with a low frame
rate, maybe 5 fps

added GeForce3 Ti200 vid card ($120.00 US)
	WOW, frame rate improved incredibly.  glass smooth even at 1280x1024. 
Still just a little bit jumpy when in really crowded areas.

now if I could just figure out how to loose the modem lag (cable).  I've
heard DSL is less laggy, but have never heard a first hand report.

hope this helps anyone considering spending money!
