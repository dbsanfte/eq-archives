If you follow Karana, see if you can find a Hafling tailor who can make
you some imbued Vale (hafling cultural leather armor.) Each piece gives
gives 1 to 3 STA and 1 to 2 WIS. My hafling druid wears almost all Vale.
If you are Xev, look for Rosewhite Blossom, she can hook you up. Her
prices run from 20pp to 250pp.
