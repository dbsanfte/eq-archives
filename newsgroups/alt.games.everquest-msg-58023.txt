Only a couple of weeks until it's due to go live, and Verant have been
strangely silent. I seem to remember a lot of preparation patches for
weeks before Kunark, and a general buzz of anticipation going around
prior to it going live. Ditto for SoV. 

Anyone in beta uotside the NDA yet?

Anyone from VI confirm the 4th as live date?

New Euroland rules means I've got to take some time off work before the
end of the year or lose it, so I was hoping to take the time around SoL
opening time, to do some serious exploration. Would be a bummer to book
the time, then find the release date shifted...
