Sounds like a good explanation.  One other possibility I wondered about,
what happens if you are too high for any creatures in the warrens when you
try to zone in?  You still zone in but just dont get any good drops?  You
cant zone in? or you go to that room?   In the brief time I played in the
warrens I talked to a higher level char that was in that room too, maybe it
is punishment room for high levels trying to play in lower level dungeons?
Just a guess.
