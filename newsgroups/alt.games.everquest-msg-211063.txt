The distance you have to be for buffs is the same as for a player 
character.  That will not change without extended range foci.

If you are having trouble with getting the pet to back off, it's because 
the mob is hitting the pet again before it is out of melee range, or the 
mob is a caster, in which case, there is little you can do about it.  You 
are slowing the mobs, right?

I have not noticed any difference in distance for the /pet attack to work 
between charmed and summoned pets, but, never paid much attention.

I can't say for certain about the low level pets, but the two highest 
ones at least do dual wield.  For it to be effective, you need two high 
damage weapons, ignore the delay.  There is a noticable difference when I 
give my pet two 10 or higher damage weapons in the amount of time it 
takes to kill a mob.

I use my pet for soloing nonPoP mobs all the time.  Used him last night 
to take down General V'Deers in OT.  I use him in CT for the entry mobs, 
I use him in FG, Droga, pretty much anywhere that mobs don't hit like the 
PoP mobs do.
