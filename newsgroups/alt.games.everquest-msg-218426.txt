I am aware of that. But that doesn't invalidate my argument... banded 
armour is now substandard to the point that you'd have to have rocks in 
your head to be wearing it...that makes any single piece i can make a 
failure by definition.

This is like the Amish quilting... sure a new quilter might not make 
quilts that are saleable... but when they get good at it, the quilts can 
be sold for very good money. Banded armour never gets there... your 
failures are apparently such disasters that the result isn't usable, and 
the components aren't even recoverable, and the 'successes' are still 
such lousy armour that nobody wants them, even the NPC merchants buy 
them back far below cost... how is that a 'success'?
