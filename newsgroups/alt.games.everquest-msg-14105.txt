...and therein lies the problem of trying to get a good picture
of this issue from message boards (including this one)...

For example, having the "do you want to be rezzed" box up in no
way interferes with the slow spell of the Guardian.  And there
are similar problems with the other things you tried to describe.

I'm not picking on you in particular, just using your post
to illustrate that all too many of the folks who are passing
judgement on this issue (on both sides) are doing so with a
very "blind men and the elephant" view of what actually
happened.
