Huh? Now your talking rubbish.  I always thought in a group a Warrior
and SK's job was to absorb hits, taunt, and do a continous flow of
damage.  And in a non uber mob group, the SK can suck HP's which is
another HP advantage, albeit indirect.

It seems you miss the point.  All I am saying is that a large race
SK's innate STAMINA bonus is GREATER than a small race Warrior's HP
bonus.  Want to stack the odds in FAVOR of the small race?  Take any
small race and jack his STAMINA.  Now take a large race and put 0 in
stamina.  I bet at 60 The SK still comes away with more HP's.  You
seem to forget that Knights are on a HP scale EXTREMELY close to that
of Warriors.  And through everyones flames it seems I am correct. 
Want to prove me wrong?  Find some high level Warriors and SK's and
state their Level, base STA and NAKED HP's.  This will end the
argument once and for all.  Warriors have way more HP's my ass.  Prove
me wrong and i'll feel better about my small race Warrior :)
