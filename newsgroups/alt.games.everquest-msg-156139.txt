Actually, I'm kinda wondering why you Warriors aren't a lot more
excited about /shield.  Here VI introduces something that gives
Warriors other than the MT something special to contribute, isn't
that exactly what's needed to improve Warrior "stacking"?  It's
too bad it's so weak for Warriors L60 and under, and it is of
course still possible that in the end it'll be near useless like
so many disciplines are for all classes, but still...

Kaev <--- wondering if it'd be entertaining to go visit Paladins of
Norrath to see how many whiney "This should be a Paladin ability"
posts there are in the forum.
