Necro's DON'T have to meditate.  They have their Lich line of spells
that turn HP into mana AND they have their regular lifetap and their
lifetap over time spells (the DoT lifetap which will work for the full
duration even when you cast it on the mob 1 second before they drop
too).  Also considering how nasty the necro pet is they don't even
have to use that much mana during a fight outside of engulfing
darkness and fear, necro's can EASILY end a fight with a full mana
bar, and thusly, no need to meditate.

You might not want to be so superior until you gain somekind of clue
as to what the fuck you're talking about.
