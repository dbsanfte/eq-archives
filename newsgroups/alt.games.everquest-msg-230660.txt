Hi All;

Since that last patch that introduced the new spell effects, I have been
getting quite abit of video lag in groups (as I'm sure many others do).

What I'm wondering is, would a better video card handle these new effects or
am I doomed to either turn them off or turn and avoid looking directly at a
fight?

My system specs:

AMD 2000xp with 1gig of ram,  Windows XP Home, Geforce 3, 64 meg card with
current drivers, game resolution 1024x768 32 bit color. Cable ISP.

I have always played EQ with all details turned on and on high settings. I
enjoy the visual aspects of the game. I've not had any real problems with
video lag before this patch.

Would a better (newer) video card do better with my system?  I'm not talking
about one of the $400-$600 cards, spell effects are certainly not worth that
kind of money.

As always, your thoughts and advice are invaluable.

Thanks in advance for your time and expertise.
