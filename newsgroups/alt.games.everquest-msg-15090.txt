Edible goo is trival *long* before sandwiches are - or at least it was 
for me - I made stacks more of sandwiches before I started getting triv 
messages.  My search for bread recipes to begin with was *because* it's 
so damned hard to find bread on merchants - but you're right, there's 
other recipes that you can get and not have to buy from merchants 
(although when you have 70PP sitting in the bank, it feels kinda silly to 
be out there killing 5000 bats for 3 bat wings :p)

Heh - it *is* fun - I often sell my food to the merchants around newbie 
zones then amuse myself with the thoughts of what newbies happen upon ^_^ 
"edible goo? the hell?"
