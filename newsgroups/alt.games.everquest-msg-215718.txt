You should install, patch and run fine on XP. My install on my XP laptop
started with the original EQ CD (one of the 989 studios disks).

Most 98 software (say, 80%) runs fine on XP, check the requirements on the
box or their website. If it was made after Windows 2000 came out and doesn't
list Windows 2000 as an OS there is a good chance it won't work, but you can
often get patches or upgrades for more popular programs.

I didn't have any major problems with EQ on the laptop, but I didn't use it
much. Sound blaster card users sometimes have sound problems in XP, unless
they have the latest cards, because Creative labs is lazy about updating
their XP drivers, which are really the Me drivers with 'XP' written in the
strings instead, and don't work 100% right.
