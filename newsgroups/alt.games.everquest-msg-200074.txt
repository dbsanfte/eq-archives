There is no level requirement per se that I am aware of, but, probably 30s 
or 40s at a guess to kill the mob required.  As for a dark elf necro, I 
believe you would need to do lots of faction work.  The resulting bag is 
tradable, so it would be feasible to buy one, or have a friend do the quest 
for you.
