 I remember a guy who gave me a Fine Steel Sword when I was level 4. That
was probably the coolest thing at the time I had ever seen. But when I read
your post, I took notice of newbies rejecting items that were considered
"Below Standard" and offer this.

 The most fun I have ever had in EQ was "Not Knowing" what uber gear was. To
me, fine plate armor and an Argent Defender made be feel like a lvl 60, when
I was only 20. I worked hard for those items, day and night saving every
coin. I paid 800pp for that Argent and twas a deal at the time. I would
dream of some day having the "Argent Protector" just to sit in EC and show
it off to the newbies. That was when EQ was hard work, yet so simple.
 Now at lvl 52, I see Freeport empty, lvl 10 Warriors weilding lammys, and
lvl 20s with armor that is better then mine.
 I try and quest as much as possible because the feeling you get is so much
better then buying. I was pretty well hooked after the JBoots quest.
 Basically, leveling is too easy these days at lower levels. Then again,
maybe I just really sucked at it. Either way, it was a lot more fun and
exciting to see a lvl 45 hand you a Fine Steel sword two years ago. I guess
now, people just expect it to happen.
