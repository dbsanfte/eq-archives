I'm a frames-per-second-a-holic.  That's not to say I want 250 FPS
just to brag; having that many FPS is pointless.  But I want smooth
game play.  Smooth game play is far more important to me than the
snazziest graphics.  I'm sensitive to anything less than, oh, about 60
FPS.

At some point, EQ1 started walking down the road of "graphics first,
FPS second".  EQ2 takes this philosophy to new heights...which is very
dissapointing for people like me.  I don't like EQ2 for that reason
alone, the thing already seems built for computers that'll be built 3
years from now!
