I have only been using 2h for my brawler, and i was looking at getting a
pair of fist weapons, but i'm not sure what would be the equivalent of my
apprentice staff of the celestial watch, which is now white. I have a damage
rating of 12.1 on this item, which also has some nice stats. Wish i could
copy and paste the item. :P

Anyhoo, does anyone have a brawler out there and know what i should be
looking for? Shaped forged iron knuckles have a DR of 9.6, would a pair make
for better damage output?
