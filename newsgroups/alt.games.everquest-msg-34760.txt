I raise all my newbies in CB (well, except my DE).  VERY few are training
for free help.  I know that when I have to train the zone I may stop before
the zone line & see if I can eek out a little xp before being forced to zone
but I'm not looking for heals (I feel kinda guilty any time a stranger heals
me).
