And where exactly do you take that information from that they "are ALL
asian" (my emphasis, your words). There are ton's of 15 year olds in
America who's time is essientally free, and if they can make a few
bucks they will. There are countries in Central and Eastern Europe,
South America, and Africa with exactly the same situation. Making that
blanket assumption that they are all asian in and of itself without
strong supporting evidence is racist. Yantis and co will buy the plat
from anybody that is willing to sell. Farmers don't have to be doing it
full time day in day out as their only means of support to be
considered farmers.
