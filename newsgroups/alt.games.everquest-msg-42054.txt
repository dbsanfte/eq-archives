This may happen, even though the Taliban agreed as early as Tuesday to allow
the extradition of bin Laden if the US can provide clear and tangible
evidence of his involvement.

However, I don't believe that there will be a conflict that could be
regarded as a "World War", simply because of the way that sides are being
chosen. All of the "Western" World(North America, Europe) as well as Russia
and Japan and India, etc. have declared their intention to aid and cooperate
with the US in this. As long as Bush thinks before he bombs, that will
remain the case

The same is true for most Middle Eastern governments, even though it's
possible that some are, knowingly or otherwise, home to organizations that
helped plan/carry out these attacks. Be that as it may, even if the entire
region, from Palestine to Afghanistan, allied their military and industrial
might, they would not stand a snowball's chance in hell in any protracted
conflict against a NATO/Russian alliance. The Middle East region has oil,
and that's about all they have. Most, if not all, of their military
equipment is acquired and outdated, and they simply do not have the
industrial base to carry on the monumental struggle that would be theirs in
this case. Most nations in this region recognize this and have wisely chosen
the "We had nothing to do with this and don't want anything to do with this"
route. Even good ol' Moammar Khadafi of Libya, who learnt his lesson
courtesy of a pair of F-14's back in 1986, was quick to make that response.

We will almost undoubtedly see some very nasty strikes, both by bomber and
cruise missile. We will also undoubtedly see some serious Special Forces
action. At the extreme end, we might also see the US and/or NATO invade and
occupy nations that have long been known as havens for terrorism(again,
knowingly or otherwise), although I earnestly hope that a diplomatic
solution to that problem can be reached.

But realistically, as far as the type of conflict goes, I expect it to look
more like Desert Storm than WWIII.

On the other hand, should Bush act too hastily and start bombing before
they've positively identified targets, organizations and/or governments that
were complicit in this, he may run the risk of losing some or all of the
support he has managed to garner. And that's when things might get a little
sketchier....
