I believe it's 6mins, I might be wrong.

Make a hot key for it and press it, to start with it won't do much (low
skill) but eventually it'll work (and then sometimes it will damage you)

Fall off something that would normally hurt but not kill you. Success is
when you don't take damage. Best way to get the skill up is run down cliff
faces (not shear ones, just real steep ones)

Yes but you need to put points into them.

If you have 1hs skill I am impressed. I assume you mean 1hb and yes, try to
keep all your melee skills maxed, even lowly kick.

I'd suggest spending minimum possible (but do buy all the skills you need)
and save as many as you can for 17th level, then stick them all into Feign
Death.
