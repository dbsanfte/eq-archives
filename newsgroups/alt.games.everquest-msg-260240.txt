I'd add wizard to this list as well, on the "they just go solo" list.

Thats probably part of it.   But theres more to it than that.  Rogues have
trouble for a few reasons.

The big one is just no utility.  Rogues can do DPS, but thats all they can
do.  Shroud of Stealth is great, it's fun, it's the best rogue ability, it's
important for raiding, but it adds almost nothing to an experience group.
Any poison that has a useful ability is way too expensive to burn in an exp
group.  (There wouldn't be many shamans around either if Turgurs consumed a
peridot when cast.)  Snare may not seem like much, but I've seen it
repeatedly get rangers and druids groups, as few enchanters will charm
without a snarer present, and charmed pet dps blows rogue dps out of the
water, even for top end rogues.

There may be 3 DPS slots in each group, but there are 7 DPS classes
competing for those slots, and it's a position that every class can do "well
enough" in.  Nobody waits for a rogue to become available, or saves a slot
for them.  If none of those 7 classes are looking for group, they just grab
whoever.

And for some, the absolute moron rogues who use/used pickpocket against
their group are still an issue.    That ability  has caused lots of general
bad feelings about rogues, and leftover reluctance to group with them.  Even
past the level where vendor trash loot is meaningless, people by then are
used to just ignoring rogues because of it.

Theres also a fairly long period of time where rogue weapons lag
significantly behind the other classes, due to SOE trying to keep backstab
damage from getting out of hand.  From Kunark to early PoP, 15 damage was
the highest damage rating on a rogue weapon  (ultra rare one from Cursed
might be 16, I forget?), with delays that did not get sufficiently low.
Elemental rogues start doing real damage again...  but it's rough being
stuck below that level, where I have been for a long time. (1)  DPS is all a
rogue can do.. but without an elemental poker, most of the other DPS classes
are doing it better.


Monks and wizards are in the same boat really, with reguards to the utility
issue.  Monks make great pullers, but lots of other classes do just as
well... and no matter who your puller is, most groups still want a bard or
enchanter for mana regen.  And once one of those is present, anyone can pull
"well enough".    Wizards get snare, but it's inferior to ranger / druid
snare, enough that most groups dont' look for them if they need a snarer.
Evac is great, but very seldom a must have, as groups tend to be
overconfident rather than preparing for the worst.

No, they always lose a very significant portion of thier DPS when solo.
Chaotic stab AA is in no way a substitute for backstab.  It hits for minimum
backstab damage every time.   A guarenteed 130'ish, instead of 550 x 2 or 3
for me.

Rogues who can't face the back of thier opponent do about as much DPS as
warriors, only without the AC / HP / mitigation.   Not a very good solo
position to be in.   Most rogues I know that do it, can do so because they
are ultra raid equipped, and so totally overpower thier targets that it
doesn't matter.

Eh, you get to sneak around and find out all the nameds that are up, that
you could be killing if you actually had a group.  Or at least thats what I
do. : p
