>/wave bye!!  one less whiner on the servers.  Cool

Actually, I honestly do hope some of the new MMOG's pull people away
from EQ. The hyperactive d00dz are usually the first to run out and
latch onto the "next big thing". I predict an overall more enjoyable
atmosphere in the game...coupled with server pops that might cap out
at or under 2000 once again. I remember a time when many servers
capped out at or under 1500. Now you're hard pressed to find one under
2000... except the Zeks, that is. I predict the Zeks will be hit
hardest by the "next big thing". Those might actually become
tolerable...
