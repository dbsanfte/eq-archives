Assuming I was silly enough to want to spend the time and money make a
tradeskill trophy, what skill should I pick?

It looks as if it is fairly inexpensive to boost one's brewing skill to 248
(Minotaur Hero's brew). At that point, what would be my odds of success at
creating the trophy (assuming I had a geerlock fermentation device)?

A related question is there any point to being a GM brewer except to make a
trophy?

What other skills would people suggest as the best skill to take to 250?
