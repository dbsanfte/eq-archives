Right, let's knock this one on the head.  :o)

That is exactly and precisely what I am saying as well.  We agree.  I get
your point completely.

Again, I am saying the exact same thing.  I am agreeing with you, Tyger.

I agree.  Most "profane" words have been, as someone's already mentioned,
arbitrarily designated as such.  In the case of 'fuck' for example, although
it's not clear where the word originates, it has certainly been known and
used in one form or another since the 1500s.  It is not the word itself
which is taboo, but the act it describes.  Surely we live in a society now
where we're capable of dealing with sex without resorting to childish
giggling?  For that matter I have heard it mentioned that a possible way to
reduce the occurrences of underage sex and teenage pregnancy would be to
start being open and clinically precise about sex instead of dressing it up
in this tantalising mystique we insist on.  Perhaps the same principle would
stand there, too.  But I'm way off-topic now.

So yes, I agree.  Can we stop arguing now?  :o)
