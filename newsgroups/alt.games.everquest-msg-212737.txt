Aside from the fact that you have your facts wrong here.  The chance of 
failure was only reduced to around 5% on trivial items that were at low 
skill levels.  The chance of failure on a just trivial item that is 
fairly high level was always well above the 5% level.  The failure rate 
may be higher now, I don't know, I certainly have not seen a change.  
What they did do is make items that are VERY trivial for you less prone 
to failure, so that they have a less than 5% chance of failure.  As for 
lacquering gems in particular, I'd have to look up the trivial level, and 
run it through the formula that has been devised for getting a good 
approximation of the chance at success in order to answer that question.  
Generally though, once you are 50 or so points above the trivial level, 
you should be down to the minimum failure rate.
