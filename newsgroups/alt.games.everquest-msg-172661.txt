[ a great story about smithing ]

Gratz on your armor, and Damn! doesn't that feel great when you open that 
eye a sliver to see that BP on your cursor?  My guildie and I celebrate his 
comines with Dwarven Ale ( or drink ourselves to a stupor when he fails ).

There's a Dwarven Paladin of Brell in my guild who has been working on 
smithing for a while.  For the last 4 weeks ( at least, probably longer ) I 
only see him in Shadeweaver or Hollowshade.  He's been manipulating that 
war for quite a while now getting the stuff for Shadowscream.

I've watched him go from a raw skill of about 189 to now 243 ( I think ).  
I helped him slay the Shades and the Olwbears when I had some time.  He's 
made me some Enchanted Dwarven Plate for my Warrior ( 11 for 12 on the 
final combine, I think, and started doing it when it was barely trivial ).  
With his smithing and my Enchanting, we've made some other pieces for guild 
members.  The hardest part is farming the damned Drops of Mercury.  I hate 
myself now for destroying those things when I was farming for Iron Oxide 
for a friend.

His goal is to make his own Underfoot armor and to be able to attempt it 
for others.  I really enjoy tradeskills, but the dedication he has to 
making his own armor is amazing to me.  He's not rich by any means, so 
Shadowscream is the way he -has- to go because of the price.

My guildie will never get that hammer of yours, but he does use a geerlock.

Speaking of which... you said you use your hammer to raise your skill so 
that skillups come faster.  I was under the impression that the "Stat of 
Choice"  ( INT, WIS, whatever it is for the particular TS you are doing ) 
is what decided your skillups, and the skill level in your TS determined 
your failure rate.  I need to read on this now to be sure.  I've been NOT 
using a geerlock when trying to skillup and holding a 10int item in my 
primary instead ( I'm not at 255 INT even with my Brilliance Buff and don't 
usually get KEI ).

Man, did they freaking nerf Pottery down where it belonged or what??  When 
I took my hiatus away from EQ, my pottery was at 152.  You used to get a 
skillup on almost every combine.  I decided to give it 41 tries on Lined 
Poison Vials ( something like that ) and got 3 skillups and 7 failures.  I 
sure wish I would have gotten that to 200 before I had quit for a while.  
Sheesh, dumb move there.

If you do continue with Shadowscream, you are going to the NE corner of 
Shadeweaver to get your Swirling Shadows, I hope.  Non-stop killing, and a 
lot of the Shades pop up there.
