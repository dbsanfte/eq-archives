Most likely someone was ghetto mezzing Ziglark for the key to Cobalt Scar.

I've done this about 4 times (once for me and 3 for friends), hit Ziggy with
a spell or weapon (don't pull him with snare), one or two golems will agro,
take them all to zone, root Ziggy and zone out and back in, golems should be
gone (or within a few seconds) then just smack down Ziggy and loot key, with
one minor faction hit (go kill a giant in GD), much easier than the PITA
quest for the key that involves nearly dying in Kael and paying 200 pp to
get.

Ziglark is about level 25, so you have to pull him directly rather than
hoping for him to assist and chase when you root the golem next to him, not
to mention the golems are obnoxiously root unfriendly, also, the front
guards (Kcor and Enots) are also lower level and won't add when you pull,
all 3 (Ziggy, Kcor and Enots) are green at 40, although Ziggy might have
been light blue, don't remember exactly.  At any rate, Ziggy is an easy kill
for anyone whose made it this far (yeah yeah the level 3 halfling rogue,
great, good for him) and the mezzing root will last for full duration unless
purposely broken.
