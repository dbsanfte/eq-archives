I don't recall the exact loc, but if you zone into WK from NK at the
river and just follow the river westward you'll find him.  I've never
heard of anybody killing him, but you never know what a bored Druid
will decide to kite.  Just remember to stay on the river's edge and
you can't miss him unless somebody's killed him or pulled him out of
position.
