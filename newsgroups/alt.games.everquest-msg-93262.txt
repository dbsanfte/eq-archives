I can't understand anyone being upset about someone charging for their time.
I always offer something for the rez, whether it be plat, or an item.
Sometimes it's refused, sometimes not.  Personally, I always refuse
donations for any spells I cast, I used to accept them, back when I was dirt
poor, and had to pay for all the new spells, but that has stopped being a
real issue with my potion making ability.
