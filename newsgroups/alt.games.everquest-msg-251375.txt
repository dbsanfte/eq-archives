You can split the first two, a little harder as a mage but maybe possible,
make earth pet, pull both, run to GY, sic pet run to zone hope pet roots
one, zone straight back (variation of how I break camp with shaman,
obviously using root).

If you can split them, try a single one and see how you do.  PoV outer caves
may be good for this, fair amount of space (though on a hill), can get
singles that are worth similar exp to HoH or BoT mobs.
