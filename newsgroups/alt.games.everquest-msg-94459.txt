Few and far between. Most high level zones are so dangerous anyone training
usually dies long before they can get out, unless they are already close to the
zone. If there are other people in the zone besides you, your group
or your raiding party the zone is not safe. You can sit there and buff/med whatever
but don't you dare have the nerve to look surprised that a train comes through.

Zone edge. And if you are forming groups for a raid, I'm sure you'll have
enough people so that someone can spot a train and warn people in
plenty of time to either deal with it or zone.

Skyfire? Easy anywhere on the zone edge NOT near a zone out.

Yes, that would be called a train.

They are not safe. We are talking about trains here.
Where do trains go? To safe spots? To the King Room?
To the Dungeon? To the Attic? No they go to the EXIT.
If you are at the EXIT you will be trained. Sooner or Later.

'Safe' because its the only place period but its not really 'safe' is it?
Medding and organizing for raids you have no choice sometimes
depending on the zone but they are still not safe. Certainly not
for going AFK, or medding without paying attention.

The whole point is trains are a fact of EQ life, like shit they happen.
And they most often happen at the zone line. It sucks but that's the way
it is. They happen so often I never even think twice about it. If I get hit
by one, I pick up my corpse and move on. I don't spend the next 20 min
of my life /shouting "Who brought that TRAIN! You Fucker you got my
whole Party killed you asshole!"

Case in point: Dawnshroud. There are several camps of mushrooms
around the the zone that are (get this) STATIONARY. Which means they
don't move, and they are not invisible and they are therefore easy to avoid, but
people train them all over because #1 they are idiots and not paying attention
to where they are going #2 they don't care that they are training and can't be
bothered to walk around the shrooms. And where do they train them? That's
right, right to the zones. This happens ALL the time, almost constantly. Yet I
still see people hunting at the zone!!! Even when they get hit by train after train
after train.  And they continually insist on whining about in shout and ooc, almost
as consistant as the trains. Boggles my mind. Do these people hit themselves in
the head with a hammer much?
