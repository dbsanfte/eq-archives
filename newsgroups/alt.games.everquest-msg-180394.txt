I have no clue who told you that, but not only will you get adds at 51,
you'll get bloody swarmed. That's pretty low level for the PoJ cells
unless you're being carried along by a higher level group. And even then
I definitely wouldn't have the level 51 doing the pulling. We've had a
57 BL grouped with us and got adds. The only time we seem to be 100% add
free is when it's just Tarre and I (both level sixty) and she doesn't
use her pet. Even the pet invites adds.

Haven't figured that out exactly myself. But for what it's worth, the
normal guards (Sentinels of Justice?) and the guys down at the trials
don't seem to be affected so you don't go KOS where it counts. I've
pretty much been ignoring those two factions. (Proceed at your own risk.
For all I know they will be critical later on. he he.)

The group you described above is going to do one of two things in any
PoP zones. You're going to perform at peek skill and just hang on and
get insane rocking XP, or you're going to repeatedly have horrible
wipeouts and/or evacs. That's kind of low level for PoP unless all of
you have all your shit firmly packed in one sock. However, best bet
might be the flies and larvae in PoD off on the little islands to the
right of the GY as you come in. Just please don't train the zone out. If
you can't evac, suck it up and die and wait for your corpses to pop
there.

(Oh, god... I just realized I feel so much better sending people to PoD
since we started hunting in Storms. ROFL.)
