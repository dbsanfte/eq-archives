I want to go from Faydark to the Warrens. I started laying out my
path, which didn't look to be an easy one. I'm lvl 15 druid, and don't
have any ports yet, and so far I been able to avoid begging for ports
( though I have to admit I'm tired of the boats ).....then I heard
that there is an easy way via Luclin ( I do have the Luclin expansion,
but have never been ).  Can someone please tell me how to get to
Luclin, I do know where the spires are in Faydwer, just don't know
what to do when I get there.....and once I get to Luclin, how do I get
to the Warrens ?    AND I assume the same path will work getting back.
I'm after some of the soft wicker drops, so any pointers there would
also be appreciated.  Thanks !!
