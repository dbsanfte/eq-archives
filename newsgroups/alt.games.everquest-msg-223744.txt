Aye, they are there, some drop in other zones too, if you see others
seemingly doing the quests its good to ask them if they find and trade
etc..

When you are that low lvl it doesnt take long to get the levels timing
it to get the drops so you are always fighting mobs for xp would be
hard. However, I dont see that making them more common would have hurt
much, as well, a lot of people would at least finish the quests that
way and have something a bit more to be proud of.

This is true a lot, similarly some of the drops off mobs are the same,
when you're killing lvl 30+ stuff and still getting drops you wouldnt
change over the newb gear let alone anything you bought it seems
silly.

I understood they had fixed it so these things do exist, but like all
things its a case of collecting the crap and going for it.. The
advantage of doing it with the real words/pages/etc is of course that
at least that way if you succeed and you make something you dont need,
of course you can sell it.

Im glad someone else looks at it like that. Its a lovely idea, but it
did make life much to easy.. I made a gnome necro, when this came out,
within 4 weeks she was 43 on a brand new server and one of the higher
lvl players, ok, due to this she was still wearing the newb quest
armor she did, but, she had 7k in the bank and was feeling good.

Being evil is not a problem any more, as PoK always talks to you and
its generally only a couple of zones away, there are trainers there,
some spells, food, water, people.. Its taken a lot of the planning out
of going places, now if you go without food and water and cant forage,
hell, its only a couple of minutes and you're back in PoK buying.

LDoN requires different strategies to normal EQ playing, as a bard I
found that most groups thought I was a waste of a group spot, except
for mana song (you dont know how boring that request can get), but,
for LDoN, they love you.

hehe, yeah you do need to be a safe distance when you do that.. :P
