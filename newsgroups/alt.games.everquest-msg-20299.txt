It goes into the system and will be answered by a GM from another server.  (or
one using invisible options to hide).

It may take a bit longer than normal to get a response (not that their normal
times are all that stellar) but they do still get it.

Also, /guildstat *playername* will give you the players guild and status in
that guild (Leader, Officer or Member), whether they are anonymous or not.
