I quoted your entire response when I responded to it.

And including the original question would not have added
any further useful context:

# Has anyone gotten a set of this yet? If so what is the effect I have heard
# it's a Spirit of the Wolf and I have heard it is a Scale of the Wolf. If
# anyone knows for sure it would be a great help.
# Thanks

The fact that the original question contained a false dichotomy
does not make your response any more accurate.

If someone had asked whether the Sir Lucan quest gives the
Fiery Avenger or the Burning Rapier, and you had answered
it gives the Fiery Avenger, would you have gotten cranky if
someone had pointed out that it's actually neither, it's the
Soulfire?  Would your defense have been that your answer was
"close enough" because both the Fiery Avenger and the Soulfire
are both flaming Paladin-only quest swords?  Or that your error
was the fault of the original poster, who didn't list the
correct answer among his original choices?

Perhaps you just take offense too easily, and/or have a problem
with simply being corrected when you make a mistake and try
to blame it on the person who corrected you, or the person
who posed the question in the first place.

Your original mistake was a very small one.  I posted a
simple correction.  Your reaction to being corrected on it,
however, wherein you took the correction as some sort of
personal vendetta against you, was a bizarre overreaction.

Try to get some perspective.
