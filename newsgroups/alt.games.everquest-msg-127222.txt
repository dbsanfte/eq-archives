We don't desire to sin.  Very few people go out and say "I'm going to sin
today, wanna join me?"  Some of the things we do are sinful, either because
they're fun, or convienant.  It's much cheaper to steal something than to
buy it... we don't have a "desire to steal," but some people steal because
it's easier.  Few people have a desire to just go around killing people, but
murders happen for other reasons.

In short, we were given free will, without the desire to sin.  The fact that
we have desires in the first place, though, introduces sin into the
equation.
