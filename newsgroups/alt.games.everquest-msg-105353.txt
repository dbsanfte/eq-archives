If you get enough extra mana to kill one more mob between med breaks, that
will speed things up in many cases.  I recall many times soloing my Wizard
where the routine was kill, then run back to a safe place to med up, then
run back out to find another mob.  A mana boost big enough to let me take
two before having to run back to the safe spot would have effectively cut
the travel time in half.  Not a huge improvement, but probably noticable.
Also, a lot of times I'd find more than one mob when searching for my next
kill.  By the time I'd kill one, go back and med, and come back, the others
were gone.  So, getting two kills per med intead of one would have cut down
the mob finding time.
