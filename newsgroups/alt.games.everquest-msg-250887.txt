I have always thought that to be the case, but only because it takes many more
swings to kill a yellow than it does to kill a cyan...  That way you have
longer time per mob in which to raise your skill if that makes sense...

I may be completely off base here and if I am, others will point that out, but
I do think that as long as the mob isn't green, your chance for skill up is the
same.
