You're forgetting something - backflagging.  The elemental guilds hate it.

Grab a wizard - always in demand in high end guilds - level him to 65, get
all of his spells, pour in a buttload of AAs, and if you don't have at LEAST
the flags leading up to the elemental planes you'll have a hard time getting
an uberguild to look at your app.  I don't mean Executioner, I mean you need
to have Bertie and Saryn done at the least, probably more than that if
you've got no reputation.

If you want to see the planes, find a guild that's trying and failing at
Bertoxx, join them, help them succeed and ride up from there.  Anything
higher and you're not likely to get in at all, given what you've said in the
past.
