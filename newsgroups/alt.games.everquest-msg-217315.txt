Huh?  What dungeon are you in and what level range?  

My friends love my chanter everywhere else, but for LDoN even my own 
brother won't group with me because I"m not a DPS or tank class.  He wants 
me to play my wizzie.  I'm considering dumping my (level 61) chanter and 
starting a rogue or SK or something until the LDoN craze goes away.
