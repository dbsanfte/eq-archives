Yep, SKs can drag aggro the best, but you are committing the mortal
sin of using a DOT; your enchanter will hate you.  If you do it more
than once, they'll probably disband you.

That's great, you're doing you job, as long as you get rid of Disease
Cloud.  Do you really think that 1% AC is going to make a bit of
difference there?  Now maybe that 12.5% increase in haste isn't going
to make that much of a difference if you're only hitting the mob once
or twice, but it makes a lot more difference than 1% AC.  Of course
now since you're NOT the main tank most of the time, that 1% AC gives
you basically nothing, but you are supposed to be dealing damage all
the time, which means your FBSS is always helpful.

OK, you're right, I shouldn't have called you an idiot.  You just
happen to be about the 4th person saying that 1% AC is better than
12.5% additional haste (and that's assuming that you already have a
60% haste buff from a chanter, if you're with a bard or shaman, it's
closer to 15%, if you have no haster it's 22% more damage).  Look at
the numbers, figure out how often 1% more AC would help you, then
think about how often 12-22% more damage output would turn the tide.
Haste is ALWAYS desirable.  Haste is ALWAYS desirable.
