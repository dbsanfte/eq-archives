Having finally raised my Knights of Truth faction enough to bank in N.
Freeport, (Woo Hoo! Though I'll never be able to go near the FP Militia
again... he he) I went to the bank via the tunnels just fine. I'd gotten
a tell from a guildie who wanted me to join him in OoT, so I began
hoofing it over to the E. FP tunnels to go to the docks and await the
boat. Fortunately, a few of the neurons must still have been firing,
because I paused to con the guy in the tunnels on the way to the rogues
guild. Glaring. Ouch. 
  I guess he's Gren Frikniller (sp?) and I see that he's actually tied
in with the FP Militia. He's also lvl 14 so I'm not to worried, but
isn't he associated with the rogues who live just behind him?
  Ok, now I have no clue how exactly I fucked up my faction with the
rogues, since I've used that tunnel before and I'm positive I only
conned dubious. But there you have it.
  I need to fix this. I looked over the list of factions at:
http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/factionlist.html
but I saw nothing that definitely indicated these rogues by name. I
found "Deep Pockets" which says it's Rogues guild faction, but all the
quests and NPCs listed associated with it seem to be in Rivervale, so
I'm thinking that's the wrong one.
  Any idea what faction these Freeport rogues are on and how I can
repair it so I can go to the docks in peace when I need to? Or is it
possible that I'm ok with the rogues and it's just this little Gren
Frick dweeb that I have to get past? I was invis when I went past the
rogues, so I got an indifferent con. (Hrmm.... should have checked that
somehow.)
