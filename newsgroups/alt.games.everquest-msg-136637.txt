Excuse me, change 'stated' to 'indirectly implied'.

Can white supremacists not read?  I wrote that black people genetically are
predisposed to being superior to junior KKK members, not all white people.
The truth of the matter is that it's not just blacks, it's everyone.  I'm
yet to meet a racist that is anywhere close to an intellectual.   Just a
bunch of insecure and scared people.

I don't hate anyone...I sometimes choose to label groups of people based on
their association.  For instance, KKK members and members of other racial
groups are automatically idiots until they prove me wrong.  Hatred is a
strong word and a strong emotion, I'm smart enough to not let it happened to
me.

No, you have the reading comprehension level of a third grader. White people
like you and him.  Racist white people who are too insecure to be
comfortable in a world with diversity.  Considering the average KKK member
is a moonshine drinking red neck with half of his teeth missing and an IQ of
87, they don't have a lot room to talk about being superior.  In actuality
these red necks feel threatened by people that are superior to them, in this
topic of conversation it happens to be blacks.  No, not all blacks.  But
even the blacks that you would consider to be 'the lowest'  are just a tid
bit over your average KKK member.  It's jealously and insecurity, hence why
you and him are idiots.  Unfortunately it doesn't take an IQ much higher
then the level of a 10 year old to use the internet, so we now have the
retarded white people spreading hatred and propaganda that they themselves
don't understand.

I know that was supposed to be a witty comment on your part, but it brought
up an interesting point.  Sheepdom, most of the members of these groups
never had a problem with ethnicity and culture until they blindly started
following.  Sometimes they were born into it, sometimes they were just too
stupid to think for themselves.  Where do you fit in?  Were you born in it?
Or did you have some kind of a bad experience with a black/Mexican that
changed your view point on the entire race?  Were you influenced by some
leader standing above the crowd with a soothing voice that was strong and
loud?
