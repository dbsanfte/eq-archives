 >What exactly is crowd control and what character can do it?

 From my understanding, CC is basically keeping the 'Whoops,
we have adds!' mobs from all piling onto the MT at the
same time or going for the other members of the group.

There are different ways to do it. Rooting a mob can be
crowd control, mezzing and charming are other ways. So
more than one type of character can do CC (depending on
the situation/fight conditions.)
