Ok, I will go ahead and throw in my 2cp
I have a mage and a monk... tho my monk is only level 7 ;-)
My mage is 53.

I don't have enough experience with my monk to say much about that class but mage is
another story.
My mage doesn't have any troubles soloing and I also still get exp off light blues
even with pet.
As long as I throw in a couple of nukes or 3, I usually get most of the damage in.

Aside from the Beastlord I have found the mage to be the BEST soloer in game.
I never have to go to a city for anything except maybe to bank and stock up on
malachite and cats eye agates.
