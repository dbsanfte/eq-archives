Sucks that somebody lost their loot but IMO thats just deserts for
attempting to sploit.  You should know by now theres a high chance of a GM
watching you as you complete more server-firsts in PoP.

If your not trying to sploit, the planar projection is up more than long
enough that everybody who helped to kill it will get a character flag.
