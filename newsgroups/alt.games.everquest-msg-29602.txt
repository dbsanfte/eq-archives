He he sounds like me - I have approximately 12 Alts (Not counting Mules
under level 10) from 11 to 35 -
My friends have decided that I have an EQ-Multiple Personality Disorder.
Thanks for the input though - From what I've read it seems most alliances
are ranked in importance by the best quests for your specific class in play.
Any further input you have will be appreciated-  I know of at least one
other person watching this thread so we both thank you I am certain.
Good Hunting..
