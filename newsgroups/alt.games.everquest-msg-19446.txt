The AoE spells are generally crap. The dam efficiency is usually better on 2
or more targets, but you'll aggro the hell out of at least 1 of the mobs.
The efficiency is not worth dieing for imo.

Fade moves only a few steps, Shadow Step can take you much further. If you
plan to have this one as a way to get far enough for a gate I would suggest
Shadow Step.
Note: The Fade/Shadow Step line tends to go down the z-axis. This means if
you're close to water and you fire this spell you have about 80% to end up
under water. A good tactic is also to stand on a higher point. I always
tried to get my wizard on top of dunes, barrels, rocks, whatever as long as
I was above my surroundings and my Shadow Step would take me quite a long
way.
