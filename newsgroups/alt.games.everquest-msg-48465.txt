This is nolonger true.  you now can get true sat service up and down.
for a reasonable per month fee.  Both Direct TV and Dish offer it.  or
you can go i think to places like Radio shack.

the main problem with using it for gaming is that you have a delay
caused by the distance the signal goes from ground to Sat back to
ground.   you can get fast through put, but you may be a second or so
behind whats actually happening,  so it has some defects as a gaming
platform.
