Antonicus Gnoll-slaying Bayle!  That does explain it!  Thanks for
making my spew Tumpy Tonic out my nose.

Anyway, I'll use this french-bashing as an excuse to segue into
full-scale xenophobia and ask a question about interactions with
European and Asian guilds on other servers.  Innoruuk has a calendar
to schedule Fear/Hate raids, and pretty much agreed upon rules for
booking planes.  Can have one of each booked at a time, book for 18
hours or so, no two weekend bookings in a row, etc.  Everyone knows
it's rather broken since those plains have been updated, and
especially with the epic drops there.  Anyway, a high-level Asian
guild has started just heading up there during the US day and clearing
quest mobs and such.  I personally don't see it as a problem, since
the mobs are on enough different spawn times that it's pretty hard for
them to get more than 1or 2 at a time and non-named spawn so fast
anyway.  Wondering if this is an issue on other servers.  (Also
wondering if every server has a really powerful off-hours guild.)
