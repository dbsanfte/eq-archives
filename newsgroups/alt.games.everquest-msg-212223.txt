Hmm, losing agro every proc?  When were you taunting? only after
losing agro?  What was the Paladin using for a weapon?  At L40
a Paladin hasn't yet fallen hopelessly behind a Warrior in ATK,
could the Paladin have been generating more hate than you with
any sort of frequency due to melee alone?  What I'm thinking
here is that if the random number generator is making you and
the Paladin see-saw in hate (mob parry/dodge/block/riposte will
cut your number of hits but don't apply to the Paladin if he's
behind the mob) while you guys are using positioning to try to
hold agro on the Warrior, then every one of those successful
Taunts that happens to occur when the Paladin has the lead in
hate will ratchet you upwards.

Come to think of it, given the randomness of such a "hate race",
constantly mashing Taunt in a duo like that might actually be
the most effective way to use it... ick!  I hate to admit to
that, mashing Taunt for any reason other than skilling up as a
lowbie just seems so wrong, but it explains what you observed
without breaking the hate+1 theory and I'm not seeing a better
explanation atm.  [Caveat:  it's worth noting how much different
duoing tankers are from a "normal" group where your biggest agro
issues involve casters generating big gobs of hate from one or a
few spells].

The problem with that test is that a difference of only 1 in hate is
going to be easily outweighed by proximity, might be tricky to ensure
that both characters were getting the same modifier for the agro check.

Be sure and let us know if you come up with a repeatable experiment
that shows your "X" factor.  I'm pretty sure that I'd not be alone
in my interest in that demonstration.  :)
