I can't believe it.  Kicked out again.  I had plenty of summoned food on my
mule to sell for 3 days.  Now, when I log in, I need to spend 3 minutes
summoning food again and not selling.  I want all the plat I would have made
in addition to the $.07 of lost game time.  Also, I want the world timers to
stop running on patch day so I can keep all my No Rent stuffs and not worry
about spending an additional few minutes getting it back.  Damn you VI/SONY!




Now, if this has made anyone think about quitting... Can I have your stuff?
