Not sure if this would work but worth a try.  go up to a higher
resolution where you can get hold of all the windows and move them
toward the center of the screen.  Change back to the resolution you
want to play at and hopefully you will now be able to get at the
window handles.  Then reposition the windows.

I suppose you could also go into the EQClient.ini and manually edit
the window x,y locations but sometimes those coordinates don't seem to
make much sense and a wrong number could probably move a window
completely off the screen.

Hope this helps...
