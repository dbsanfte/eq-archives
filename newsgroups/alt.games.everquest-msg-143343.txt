While you can very well kill any of the mobs that start the epic, unless you
are a shaman, or a beastlord the lesser spirits will do nothing more than
insult you when you hail them.  They will talk to beastlords but won't give
a beastlord any of the gems or the next step in the shaman epic.  Pretty
much there is no way to raise truespirit faction outside of the epics, but
you sure can trash it easily enough.
