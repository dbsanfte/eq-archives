Fun idea but a couple problems:

1) verant says that any player change form or any pet form has to be
amongst the models loaded for EVERY player when they load the zone.
This means that the more such model types that exist, the more
resources the zone loading will take up.  So even if verant did this,
they'd have to make it a choice as to whether or not a player turned
it on like they do with luclin. Even then, they said once that they
just don't want to bog people down that much and extra models is very
resource intensive. 

This is the exact same reason why they don't want to put in more
frivilous pet models, like giving an iksar necro and iksar looking
skeleton. They have answered that question the same way everytime.


2) This is something that already happens in D and D, Ad and D, as you
mention. Verant has stated before this is an original work (as much as
possible) and that they don't pick things which are a big part of
other game systems. 

If you remember right, the Reincarnate in Ad and D carried a HEAVY
penalty and was only a last resort. I remember that it was assured of
removing a constitution point and you could come back as the exact
same race or perhaps an elf or gnome or something else not even that 
exotic. I think there was even a chance you could come back as another
class or a race which could not be your class (would mean starting out
at level one as another class) and various other possible penalties.
All of this is in the dungeon masters guide, I think.

It is a fun idea but something they won't do because of the change
form resource thing. Plus, even if they did do this you'd look like a
skunk and not like a skunk in plate armor since that would take even
more resources. Each equippable model takes up memory resources due to
having a completely diffrerent texture look from other models. Even an
ogre female in chain is different from an ogre male in chain, on both
the new AND the old models.

A similar idea which would be doable, was how in AD and D some things
could be cursed and change the wearers gender. I always thought that
was funny. Now that WOULD be doable, it takes no more resources. I
think in that case though they know it would peeve players. They could
perhaps make use of the druid or other class new remove curse spells
to fix it though. Or maybe that wood elf would enjoy being female for
a change, or perhaps the item would only make the a diff sex when it
was on but would be a very powerful desired item.
