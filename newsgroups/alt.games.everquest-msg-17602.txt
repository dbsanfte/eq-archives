I'd say the 1hs is at a decent melee skill for your level.  Most
people will laugh and say, "Why are you even worrying about your
weapon skills?  Druids shouldn't melee!"  But like you said, there are
times when you're oom or low on hp, and you just want to get that
critter dead so you can get away and med safely somewhere.

I've been switching between 1hs and 1hb with my druid.  I started
using a FS/combine scimi and got that skill maxed until I got a
Wraithbone Hammer in my mid 20's somewhere.  I burned 60 practice
points just to get my 1hb at a decent level, because at that point I
was still using the porcupine method/melee to kill some mobs, and the
damage on the wraithbone hammer isn't bad (and had a small WIS bonus
too).  After a lot of work I've gotten my 1hb up to 133, but my 1hs is
languishing at 108.  I'm thinking of buying a cheap 1hs and using it
on snare-dumb mobs to get it back to a decent level, because if I ever
get my epic it would be nice to have a maxed 1hs skill to go with it,
just to cause chaos when I'm goofing around in lower level zones :)

Yeah, that's the only time I melee now too.  But, it's nice to have a
good skill so you can kill whatever it is you're fighting before
something else wanders in, and either kills you or forces you to run
away.
