What with DOTs stacking, I was wondering what the
ideal root/root group would look like.

I'm thinking druid/bard/bard/bard/bard/bard

Druid has port, succor, nice strong DOTs, emergency
heals, SOE, and of course the vital root line.

Bards chant, which is to say mana free DOT that isn't
going to go to waste no matter how fast or slow
the mobs die.  Other DOT classes are going to end up
wasting mana on DOTs because mobs aren't going
to politely die just as DOTs were about to run out;
only way around this is to use nothing but clicky DOTs,
which of course druids have in spades.

Bards can also pour mana in to the druid as needed,
provide crowd control if that becomes an issue...

On the other hand, something like a 6 druid team could
have DOTs stacked on multiple mobs simultaneously,
while bard DOT plan is strictly one at a time (for maximum
DOT per target that is)

At any rate, given the new bonus group bonus for killing
high level mobs, I thought that a power group plan for
killing high level mobs with tons of HP might be interesting
to devise here.

Of course the ultimate group would be druid/cleric/bard/bard/bard/bard,
but you'd have to show me an undead mob.
