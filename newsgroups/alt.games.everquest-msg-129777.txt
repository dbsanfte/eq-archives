Sounds like an old guildie of mine.  He finally got cut off from his
ISP when they were able to show that his AVERAGE monthly download was
over 400Gb.  His highest month he downloaded over 700Gb.  He had an
entire room full of CDs full of games, movies and pr0n.  He was unable
to get another broadband connection once his ISP cancelled him, and he
stopped playing EQ about 2 days after his connection was pulled.
