Of course she didn't say it was against the law. However, her statement that
anyone who buys pp is an idiot, is certainly an implication that one should
not spend real life money on in-game currency. Perhaps I inferred that (cut
you all off before you get me on that one), but I think the implication is
clear. In effect, she is trying to tell people how to spend their money, or
at least how NOT to spend their money.

If you say to your friend, "Hey, wouldn't it be cool if I stuck my head in
this deep-fryer?", and he said, "What are you an idiot?" or "Only an idiot
would do that", isn't he essentially telling you not to do that? Anyone who
thinks otherwise is an idiot (jk).
