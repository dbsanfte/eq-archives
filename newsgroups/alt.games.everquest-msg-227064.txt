I think you're missing something here.  When exactly did a cloak of flames,
a 36 percent haste cloak, become a "class appropriate" item for a cleric?

(Yes, yes, quiet Lance. =P)



That being said, I think Naggy and Vox are a special case where NBG should
not be used.  Due to the level limit, these raids are done by alts, and need
those alts to succeed.  If Player A is currently a 52 ranger twink, with a
shaman main somewhere, and Player B is a 52 cleric twink, with a monk main
character somewhwere...  it seems silly to say "only Player A can roll,
since they are the melee character here."
