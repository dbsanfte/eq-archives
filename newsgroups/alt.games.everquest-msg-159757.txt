Their *largest* customer base is *all* customers, not the subset
which has 50+ characters, even if that subset is 99% of the whole.
The larger the percentage of customers who meet the high-level
requirements for the new Planes the better, of course, but it's
still not as good as selling something to the entire customer
base.

I'd disagree that it's "short-sighted" simply because it's the
customers with 50+ accounts (really a bit higher than that, IMO)
who are the ones most prone to leave since they've maxxed out
their potential.  At some point, a character will hit a wall
the player's not willing to go past.  Whether that's spending
*another* 10 hour day in VT or *another* 3 hour session in KC
(or Velks or OS) isn't important, it's the fact that, at some
point, that wall *will* be reached.  So adding new Planes
where the 50+ crowd can XP and raid is a good thing, IMO.

That said, they certainly could have done more for the under 50
crowd.  A couple of Planes could have been "15 to enter, get
kicked (ala Vox/Naggy) at 30" with another couple "25 to enter,
get kicked at 40" and another "35 to enter, get kicked at 50."
Fill the loot table with level appropriate focus items and
gear and it would have extended the game's life quite a bit,
IMO.  You'd not only get the upper-level players doing their
planes, but you'd get their alts and lower-level players doing
their planes.  And, with level appropriate Planar gear with
the now-common anti-twink restrictions, you'd have reasons to
go other than just the experience.  (As an example, they could
have put in Flowing Thought items that are level 15 to 35 *only*
in the lowest planes and moved up that gear as the planes
progressed...)
