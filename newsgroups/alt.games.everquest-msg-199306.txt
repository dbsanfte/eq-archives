Generally more trouble than they're worth.  I'd estimate about two groups.
They are slowable, and even unslowed thier melee is nothing special at all.
They could be single grouped, except for the annoying port ability.   I'm
don't remember for sure if it's based on rampage list, or if it's based on
something funky with the hate list, but if you don't bring enough warm
bodies, they will port all your damage dealers / healers outside.    It
might be possible to just run them back in, but when we were doing it
usually the guards would be back up.  (or not killed in the room you were
ported to.)   Must be killed in thier room, or they will gate instead of
dying.
