No, it's apparently going to swap between London and Manchester alternately.
It's previous site was Loughborough University, which was actually really
good (IMO)
I'm not into desktop RPG and haven't been for sometime but it's still
enjoyable event. Last time I went I won the Wireplay event for Q3 (or at
least the one I entered, they never managed to get all the winners together
to play each other) never did get my prize :�/
I'll prolly go along to at least one of the days in London but looking at
the Website there is very little happening, only about 10 traders listed (at
a rumoured �2000 a pitch that isn't surprising) and nothing PC orientated
mentioned, no FPS, no RTA and definitely no EQ attendance...oh well.
