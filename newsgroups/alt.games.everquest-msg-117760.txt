POST SCRIPT:

First, I want to give a great big THANK YOU to everyone who responded with
help and advice...Frog, CG, Tron, and Richard (and anyone else who may have
posted, but whose posts I may have missed... I don't see all the posts in
this NG).  You were all helpful, and kept me from totally losing my
sanity....

Now, I want to let you know how things turned out.......

I visited the HP message boards.  It was like taking a trip to the Island of
Lost Souls, where most everyone wandered about helplessly, eyes glazed over,
desparately calling out for help, with no one to hear their cries.  It was
all very sad.

There was a special spot on the Island where there were two graves....one
marked Hewlett, and the other marked Packard.  The graves spun wildly,
desecrated by the current CEO, as loyal old retired employees watched from a
distance and wept....but that is another story.....

In one remote corner, someone's cries had been heard, and several helpful
links had been posted.  This gave me hope.  I followed the life-line off the
Island, armed myself with much new information, and proceeded to stay up
until 3am beatting my head against a series of dead-ends.

Next morning.  I swallow my pride.  Last resort....

I take my system & the video card to work, and half the I.S. Dept works on
it for several hours.  The team included two former HP employees, one former
Microsoft tech support, and one former Agilent Technologies production
worker.

The verdict?  There is no human way possible to disable the onboard video on
an HP Pavilion 6573Z  (short of ripping the 810 chipset off the motherboard
with my bare teeth....and they were sceptical about even that working....)

No way to disable the video in the BIOS.  No jumpers that deal specifically
with video.  No empty slots that one could solder a component onto the board
that you could then put a jumper on to disable/enable it.

Zilch.  Nada.  Nunca.  Game Over.  At least I don't feel stupid anymore.

One of the former HP employees did say that by some odd happenschance, I
might be able to find a video card that might work, but it would be extreme
hit-and-miss.  I'd be money ahead to just buy a whole new system.

But I need to buy a new car first...... so for now, I'm stuck with the 810
chipset.

Life goes on.  Meanwhile, my ancient decrepit old Packard Bell is about to
get a video card upgrade it never dreamed of ever seeing...... and HP just
lost yet another customer......for life....



/em puts HP on his permanent Do Not Rez/SoW/Port list.....
