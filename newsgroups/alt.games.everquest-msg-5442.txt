Trust me, I see your points.  Perhaps I just need
to quit the game.  Sometimes I feel like a slave
to it.  I play 4-5 hours a night and it leaves me
always wanting more.  I walked away one time for a
few months and came back.  .  Actually its not the
levels that I want so much as the ability to build
up some pp and get some of the cool itmes.  I
guess I should build up a few hundred or so pp and
sit at the tunnel trading stuff for a while to
take a break.  I see stuff all the time that I
could buy and turn around and sell for a nice
profit.  Perhaps I will go into the trading
business.  I honestly think I could buy and sell
stuff full time and get more enjoyment out of that
than constantly trying to level up. Maybe I'll
start killing wisps until I can build up a little
money to get started with.

$100 bucks is a lot of real money to spend to get
nothing tangible in return but when I look at in
terms of how long it would take for me to get
those ten levels it seems resonable.  I'm not
saying it's right because I don't know myself.
That's why I'm asking the question.
