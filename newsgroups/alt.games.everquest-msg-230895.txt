jump in, waters fine

when you say "everquest adventures online" I wonder if you are talking 
about the console game, if you used to play air warrior you want the 
regular pc everquest, take my word

some former air warriors play on cazic-thule, you'll know you found them 
when you hear the mbaaaaa
