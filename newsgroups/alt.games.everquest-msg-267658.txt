I don't think so. The classes and spells and skills are so different 
that any similarity is coincidental.

Not at all. So far at least. There is undoubtedly more content which 
can't reasonably be soloed but there is plenty of content which can be. 
I'd say that there is less contents that can be soloed, but that when 
something can be soloed it's easier to do so for all classes.

Not possible. Once a mob has been engaged the encounter is locked and 
it's not possible for a higher level player to attack the mob at all in 
any way. The player can unlock the enocunter so anyone can attack, but 
then nobody gets experience. This is intended to prevent the insane 
power levelling of EQ1 rather than KSing, but effectivly prevents that too.

In EQ1 you pretty much can't play until you get your corpse back. In EQ2 
you can play at slightly reduced effectivness until you do. Assuming you 
retrieve your corpse, the EQ2 experience debt seems somewhat less 
thatthe experience loss in EQ1. It's still enough to make you certainly 
want to avoid unncessary death though.
