An example of what?

This is what Gershom Scholem says;
[my brackets]

"This mystical discipline [Kabbalah] made use of
the letters of the alphabet, and especially of the
Tetragrammaton and the other Names of God, for the
purpose of training in meditation. By immersing
himself in various combinations of letters and
names, the kabbalist empties his mind of all
natural forms that might prevent his concentrating
on divine matters. In this way he freed his soul
of its natural restraints and opened it to the
divine influx, with whose aid he might even attain
to prophecy." 

This is what Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan says;

"All that is formed and all that is spoken is one
Name.' The initiate [of Kabbalah] not only knows
this intellectually, but he can actually visualize
and see that all creation is nothing more than one
Name, the Tetragrammaton" 

I am sure you recognise the authority of these
scholars.

If they have no knowledge of him, they are very
poorly educated about their own religion.

Have you ever read any history of Wicca, that
doesn't mention Gardner?

Are there any serious claims that Gardner had
nothing to do with Wicca?

>I'd hardly say he's necessary to Wicca.

What do you mean by 'necessary'?

He is inseparable from the history of Wicca. He
almost single-handedly brought it to the notice of
the general public, with his writings.

Who would you say has been 'necessary' to Wicca?

More like St. Paul's role in Christianity.

I'm glad we agree on that one.

A group that Gardner was well acquainted with, and
borrowed heavily from.

Some questions for you and any Wiccans interested
in the truth of the matter;

What is the origin and symbolism of the pentagram?

Who is Robert Cochrane and what does '1734' mean
in association with him?

A matter of degree perhaps, but you couldn't say
that the 23rd Psalm has "no significance
whatsoever" to Christianity, could you?
