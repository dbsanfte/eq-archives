I'm not quite sure I understand what you're saying, but I remember a really
hard time crossing over from gold/ruby to plat/malachite.

Do gold all the way up to ruby, even though the plat/malachite is cheaper -
the increased success rate will cover the cost.  Also, enchant every bar. 
It takes more time, but you can sell the result back to the jeweler for a
few pp more than the cost.  Over time, this will make up your cost of
failure.  And get one of the Geerlok Jewelry Gizmos.  Adds 5 percent to your
skill, and has a noticable effect on failure rate.

Crossing the gap between gold/ruby and platinum/malachite was hard.  I damn
near gave up on it.  I think I once went for over 200 combines without a
skillup.  But once plat/malachite trivials out, the increases come a bit
faster.
