Anybody else having this problem?  I'm going along, doing things, and
all of a sudden any / all of the following happen:

Mouse locks in position on the screen, won't respond.

Mouse disappears from the screen, won't respond.

Turn keys (Keypad 4 and 6) stop working (oddly enough, they stop
working in views 1, 2, and 3, but still work in 4).  When you press
them, you slide left and right, as though you were pressing Ctrl.

Keypad locks so that I can't stop running.


I've had the above happen while fighting, while looting, while doing
tradeskills, and while just running along the path.  I've occasionally
noticed hearing a "keypress" sound while I'm moving my mouse, even
when it's nowhere near the hotkeys.

A couple of times, I've suddenly regained control, but usually not.
Someone in game suggested trying the F12 key (turns off/on mouse
controls), but it did no good.

The worst of it is, it's a total lockup.  When I get out of the game
they're still locked up, and most times I've had to use the reset
button to restart my machine (Ctrl-Alt-Del wasn't working either).


I've installed no new software in the past few weeks, nor have I
changed my hardware configuration.



Nifty Note:
/CAMP DESKTOP takes you out to the desktop, after a 30-second wait.
/Q takes you out instantly, but only to server selection.
/CAMP DESKTOP, followed by /Q, takes you out instantly to the desktop.
