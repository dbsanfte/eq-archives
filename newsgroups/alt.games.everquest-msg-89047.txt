1,2,3    RUN SPEED to third level
Perma indoor jboots that can't be dispelled. irreplaceable

4,5,6    FIRST AID to third level 
If you have 201+ bind wound it's useful occasionally to bind to 100%

OR

4,5,6    HP REGEN to third level
If you've got no bind wound, an extra 3 hp per tick if probably the
least useless of the other skills


7,8   DURABILITY to first level
About an extra 70hp at max stam  - can never have enough hp

9,10,11,12 DURABILITY to second level
About an extra 108hp at max stam - see above

OR

9,10  COMBAT STABILITY to mitigate attacks more
11,12  COMBAT AGILITY to avoid attacks more


Eventually, you'll want dura, agil, and stam archetypes maxed, so
whichever you choose to do first is kind of irrelevent. AFTER you've
maxed those 3, you can go for some of the 'candy coated' skills that
give a very slight increase in damage output, but are mostly for show.
No AA skills are going to tip the balance on whether you can hold agro
or not, but the 3 levels of durability (350ish extra hps) combined with
stability and agility skills, will make a noticeable difference in your
tanking ability.

I know a warrior who wasted 15 AA points (12 in combat fury, 3 in
flurry) just to get an extra message during a battle. He completely
regrets that now. 

Rampage was apparently useful for a short period because of a bug you
could exploit to remove the recast time, effectively turning warriors
into AE melee machines. Now it's just another battle emote.

Ambidexterity is solid, if expensive, and works out to an increase of
about 6% in offhand swings.

AE taunt might be useful if it's a 100% guaranteed 'mob turns on you'
spell, the range is small enough, and the taunt is high enough to
maintain your position at the top. Would make transitions easier in MT
fights, but with the new RoF style of fighting becoming more prevalent
as VI moves away from MTed fighting it becomes more of a curse than a
blessing. No tank could handle multiple 1100 hitters heh

Fear resistance - giggle

Resists and stats probably aren't enough to make a differnce over other
skills, but they're certainly something to spend on when you have
everything else.

BTW, spend your points when you get them. Having 12 points saved up does
no-one any good.
