Heh.  Hardly.  Wurmslayer is about the worst weapon you can use for taunt.
Almost no aggro value at all.  Each successful hit adds to aggro, so a weapon
which does half as much damage, but hits twice as often, has a *much* higher
taunt effect.  You might try switching to a good two hander on your monk.
You will still do good damage, but you will get aggro much less often.

Also, the taunt button doesn't work like that.   Its an all or nothing thing,
not a "Adds a bit to your hate."   Either you are successful and the mob
switches to you, or you were not, and it doesn't.

*shrug*  If you're paranoid about losing a few gold pieces, thats your
problem, not mine, so don't whine to me.
