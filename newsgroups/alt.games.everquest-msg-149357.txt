Sometimes those nice folks are just glad to help out a new(er)
player who is coming up the hard way.

I dropped an Iksar Regen BP, a Sash of the Dragon Born,
a Shaded Dagger, and a couple of minor pieces on a rogue
I saw occasionally.  A rogue that (1) didn't d00d out like an
idiot, and (2) was playing a rogue untwinked as a main and
still sticking it out into the 30s.

It's not that I have a bunch of plat (ok, that's part of it), but it
was mainly just being proud of the way some newer player
was giving it an old roguish try and trying to help out a tad.
Like another did for me at level 14 giving me both a Fine
Steel Rapier AND a Dragoon Dirk 3 years ago when I was
a bad-ass making my first trip beyond the wall in Misty Thicket
and needing help on a CR from Mooto :-).
