lol!  What a silly idea.  Actually I've been attacking pumas with my bard 
lately - from about level 4 to level 6.  I've found out that while all of 
them might be yellow... there's a huge difference in HOW yellow they are. 
:)

Oh, had a weird thing happen last night - I (er - the shaman that is) 
zoned into Blackburrow and this girl had 3 gnolls on her.  I was about to 
ask if she needed help when the gnoll guardsman jumped onto me from her.  
How'd that happen?  I hadn't done anything yet, so I can't figure out how 
I aggro'd him - especially since he was green (probably high green, 
admittedly, since he still hit rather hard).
