Thank you, and thanks to Paul Botts also.  I know that writing this sort of
thing isn't as easy as it may appear, and I really to appreciate the help.

   I think that keeping the class summaries to 1 or 2 smallish paragraphs
is just right.  Yes, there is alot more that can be said about each class,
but this is just meant to be a very basic primer for the true newbies to
EQ.  The FAQ is already much longer than it used to be... I don't want it
to turn into a 3 day reading exercise.  I just want to give an idea of what
each class does in grouping, so that a new player has some info to go to
research it further if they want to.  We do have links to all the main
classes websites within the FAQ as well.

   Paul, your right up of the Beastlord is very good, but can you edit it
down by about a third?  I know it will be hard to do, but I really do feel
that the length of the FAQ needs to be considered, and while this section
is a Good Thing, it does need to be fairly concise.

   To Chris's question, by all means, write some more up.  

Right now I have Beastlord, Cleric, Enchanter, Paladin, and Ranger.
