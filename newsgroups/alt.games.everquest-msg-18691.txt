You're kidding, right?   Crafted bracer blows that Erollisi bracer right out
of the water.   Twice as much AC.   The strength bonus is meaningless.

If you have a pair of level 40's, you can camp the Cloaked Damphyre in
Mistmoore for a Hooded Black Cloak.    You have the levels to do it, it's just
a question of how long you're willing to camp.   It's about an 8 to 12 hour
spawn, or something like that.  (not sure if its common or rare, only seen one
Damph in all my Mistmoore hunting, and he had the cloak (paladin with us won
the roll : P).)   Otherwise, as suggested above, the Ice Bear cloak should be
pretty cheap.

Several people have suggested this.  I'd second that (or fourth it, but who's
counting?)  while you can't camp for this at your level, the mob that drops it
is permacamped (for his rare, this is the common) so they should sell cheaply.
100 pp or less.

Again, surely you jest?   The bloodstained mantle is good only if you've
currently got banded there.   The Crafted Pauldrons are many times better.
Another good option is the Crested Spaulders from Mistmoore.   11 ac 6 sta.
They sell for well under 100 pp, and the camp for them is trivial with two
level 40's.   The Avenging Caitiff in Mistmoore.  (his common drop, plus he's
not too rare...  I got about 6 of these in a few levels of exp hunting there.
; ) )

As for the idea of swapping it in...  As a warrior with a Skull Shaped
Barbituate on, I resist most magic based spells outright already.  Or take
very little damage from them.   I'd take more damage from the casting mob's
very Melee like hits than I would save from the couple of spells if I did swap
it.

In general, the Rygorr stuff is a good substitue for (or until) class armor.
Unfortunately though, you either have to twink it or buy it from the item
pharmers.  By the time you're able to get it (at least 45 with a full group),
you really should have better... and it's permacamped by others looking to
sell or twink.   The class quest armors can generally take you all the way to
Planar level, when you can start going for those.

As for these recommendations...  well, you can see mostly what I think of
them.   Stats are meaningless.  Resists are nice, but pretty irrelevant in
normal experience hunting.  (although save the good resist items for when
you're 45 - 60 and doing Dragon / Golem / hard mob with an AE attack raids...
at that point they become as important as AC, and in some situations more.)
But other than that one type of situation, AC is king.
