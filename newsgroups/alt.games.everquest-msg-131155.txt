i agree with chris, i see this often while working on computers.  If the RAM
is full the virtual memory manager spends too much time moving around pages
in and out of RAM..  The only ways I know to fix it are to get more RAM of
to  leave fewer applications running at once.  I would not let this continue
too long, disk thrashing can wear out you hard drive and cause it to fail.
i would suggest another 256 megs of ram and you should be fine. GL.
