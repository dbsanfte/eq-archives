Actually the ones screwing up the economy are the duplicators not the
sellers.
And I'm amused with the person who doesn't really think we're a
husband and wife team.  Yes we do all this ourselves.  I'm flattered
that you think we're less talented than we really are :)  We go to
sleep at night, we don't have people delivering for us 24/7.

Trolling is reading a newsgroup and constantly causing trouble and
mayhem by poking fun at others on the group.  I certainly am not doing
this, nor do I approve of such actions.  In fact, trolling seems to be
what your doing not what I'm doing...

Why dont we tackle the tough issues instead like... why or why not
Sony should put in a casino.
