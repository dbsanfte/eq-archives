Well most of us are still extremely pissed off about this, it only happened
a few hours ago.. what a horribly wasted day/evening/night!

Heres the scenario.  My guild spent around 11 hours clearing PoG Thursday
(took so long for various reasons.. starting early in the day so nobody else
took the zone and not many people on, people playing their twinks, some lazy
ppl who only came for the last few fights etc)

Anyway PoG is a HUGE zone, and takes a long long time to clear.. in order to
kill Tunare you have to kill all zone mobs, else she issues a "call to arms"
when you agro her, and all mobs run to her to assist.

So 11 hours from the first groups porting into PoG, Tunares guardians are
dead, the named and other mobs are dead, and were left with Ali the elder,
and Tunare... within 30mins some people are going to be rewarded with some
very sweet loot.

A guildie was having issues about something (don't know details).. so a gm
came into the zone to talk to him or something.. frustrated at the gm's
response however, he says something in guild chat to the effect of "god what
a waste of time that GM was"

The GM leaves the zone.. all of a sudden trackers say "errr wheres
Tunare...?!?!"

What a strange coincidence after that comment in guild chat, Tunare poofs
and the GM left the zone.

The petition responses were humorous.. to put it 1 way.  Now I know and
understand GM's dont have to have been a part of the upper levels raid scene
to be a GM, but if you have no experience in it, why not just STFU and let
somebody deal with it who has a clue?

GM reply number 1.. "Well how do you know Tunare isn't up?"

Hi, shes perma rooted, moron.

Gm reply number 2.. "According to our logs she was killed by other players"

Umm its one of the highest level raids outside SoL (second only to AoW imo,
maybe even on a par with him).. I think we would notice 40+ people zoning in
and engaging killing her (besides theres enough respect left on Prexus to
ensure that would never have happened)

Gm reply number 3..  Email xxxx@wjhereever.com and tell them... you should
have a response within a week.

A week?  gee thats awful kind of you.

Based on a total lack of real answers, silence on the part of the gm who was
in PoG etc.. what else can we conclude other than out of spite, he /killed
our mob.

So because of 1 person, he decided to fuck 50+ other people over.. well
thats just great.  Thanks for making us waste the whole fucking day clearing
a truly horrible zone to clear.

(For those not aware of her, when Tunare respawns she also fully repops the
zone in the same way Cazic does in PoF)

Sure the guildie should have kept quiet (and it was nothing overly insulting
either, and may well have been justified - i don't know) but these people
are expected (and most paid) to act in a mature and responsible way.
Pulling stunts like that should result in instant fucking dismissal.

/rude that gm.

thanks for spoiling everybody in my guilds day asshole
