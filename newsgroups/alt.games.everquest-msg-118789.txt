(I know I posted this about 10 hours ago, but it never showed, so trying
again).

I decided to re-live the old days of adventure, and set out to acquire my
LV12 pet buff spell (though haven't had a chance to test it yet, too busy
helping the locals with needed tasks, and getting satisfaction as well as
their likings of me as a reward).

    Now where should I hunt?  Some have said the Warrens, and then just to
sell the bronze to the druid there (I'm a Dark Elf, and a Necromancer,
wouldn't I be KOS to a druid in Tox Forest?).
    Should I return to various zones on Antonica or Odus, or go to the
jungles of Kunark, or stay up on the moon?  And where in that area should I
hunt?  I'm mainly looking for the exploration and EXP, but if possible would
like to keep a steady flow of coin building up in my bank as well (the
platinum kind, not the copper or silver kind).
    Any good suggestions (where I'm preferably NOT KOS)?
