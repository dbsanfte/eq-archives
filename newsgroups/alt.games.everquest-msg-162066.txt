Druid plat for ports was hardly a nerf...people still ask for ports and
nowadays if someone wants an urgent port then they will generally pay.

Warriors were beefed up?...Explain that one, I must of missed it. What beef
did we get? You see many of solo'ing?

The fact that a none casting melee class could solo was maybe an indication
to Verant that the class was imbalanced, in general group play a well
equipped monk was a better choice, as tank, than a well equipped warrior.
Ubergear is not gained by solo'ing. You just cannot solo the mobs that drop
items that most would consider uber, sorry.
