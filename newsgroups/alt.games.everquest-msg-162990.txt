Sorry, I didn't word things very well there.  I am well aware that I
go through more of both food and drink while force-feeding.  It seems,
however, as if food is consumed faster, relative to drink, when I am
in near constant melee.  It's hard to tell, because my food and drink
have different rates of consumption already (I usually carry Iron
Rations and Water, because they are always easy to procure and the
expense is miniscule).

Like I said, I've never tested it, just seems like I use more food
during heavy fighting, again relative to drink, than otherwise.
