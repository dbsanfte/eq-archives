It is ripping people off when they send an auction WTB Batwings 5pp
per stack and I sell them to them for what they are wanting to pay?  I
dont think so.

This is a good point, but I am level 8, and unable to TP.  When I get
the ability (what is it 19 that I get Rings I think) I wont be
worrying about selling batwings in Gfay=)

Unless you are below 14 and cant SoW and below 19 and cant even Self
TP.

Me too.  :-)  I look forward to the new recipies as well that allow
more variety in getting to 199 (since Fletching is my 200+ choice).

And how are batwings not a luxury item?  I may not know all of the
purposes of them but isnt Levitate a luxury?:-)
