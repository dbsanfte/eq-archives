Yes it does.  DT's inevitable answer is that Whatever Verant Thinks is Best
MUST Be Best.  That's it.

He has NO FUCKING IDEA if we're in the minority or not.  But I DO know that
if they did change it (not going to happen, but it'd be nice) so that you
DID have the ability to say "huh?  I don't WANT you to know what I'm
wearing...what business is it of yours?" (especially when the answer is
inevitably, "well, actually, none whatsoever, sorry for asking") that he'd
suddenly be on the other side calling the NOSEY people the whining minority.
