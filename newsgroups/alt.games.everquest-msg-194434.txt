Ho really ? That's what they promised to the Sebilis, Venril Sathir and Kael
Drakkel european players.

We purchased mint european-only 60 U.S. Dollars packages to be able to play
on the new servers (no, we could not play with an original account on the
new servers), then, guess what happened 2 monts after server launch ? Free
movelog for 1 thousand accounts per destination server, plus transfer will
full stuff and money available for 50 U.S.D one week later, plus original
accounts can now freely play on the new servers without buying a 60 U.S.D
package another week later.
