The first 9 levels are the hardest....no spells and no pet.

If you have Planes of Power (or start a Kitty BL) go to the
Shadeweaver's Thicket side of Paludal Caverns at level 5 (train Kick
before you go). Hunt the bugs near the zone in. You will hit level 9
in a couple of hours. 

Once you get to level 9 you have to buy your first pet spell Spirit of
Sharik (I think that's the right name) to summon your pet. Be sure to
read up on the class/spells at www.eqbeastlord.com Lot's of good
information there.

You can find maps at www.eqatlas.com

Good luck, and have fun
