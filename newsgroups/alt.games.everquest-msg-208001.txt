It is an appreviation for "quad-kiting".  A tedious soloing technique
available to mid- and high-level Druids and Wizards.  Basicly you get
four mobs snared and tightly grouped chasing you and use your four
target area-effect direct damage spells over and over and over again
until the mobs die.  Some people enjoy quadding, others are enamored
of the relatively fast experience gains that can be had (assuming room
to kite and a sufficient supply of mobs).  I find it extremely boring,
and as there are many other ways to gain XP I don't do it.  ymmv
