"Verant answers the prayers of Paladins. `No', says Verant."

(With apologies to The Onion)

In all seriousness now... There are what, a dozen different classes in
the game? To ask for all of them to have equal weight at the end game is
highly unrealistic. You may have noticed that the only classes that have
a pivotal role in the end game are those that are the most
group-dependant and difficult to solo. I think this is only fair...
Hybrids, Druids, Necromancers, etc. have an easier time getting there,
so let those for whom it's a hard slog take the spoils.
