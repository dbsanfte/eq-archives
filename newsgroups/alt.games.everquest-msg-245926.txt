What do you guys think of having auto-grouping in EQ?  I am a lvl 52 Pally
who has grouped 20-30% of my lifetime, simply because I cannot find groups.
I beg, try to start them etc...Based on this the game sucks.  Soloing sucks
when you kill one beast, then sit for 30 mins.

My porposal to Sony...Dynamic Groups.  You set the LFG flag, and when there
are 5 or 6 people from various classes you get dumped into a group.  This
stops people from being picky like little bitches about having the perfect
group, and teaches them to play in rough (bad groups) or good groups.
