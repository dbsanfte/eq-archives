Hey I hadn't thought about making mead.  Been making beer for years.
Can you recommend and good web pages with recepies and advice.  Doing
searches doesn't get you the most respected sites, or those little hit
gems that only  the elite know about.  Or, I hesitantly ask, would you
share your own technique.

I'm a bit remote so you don't have to worry about your recipe becoming
mainstream.


Thanks.

I'll even post my webmail address.  I never post my real.  (I wonder
if I'll get a bio like Bizbee for mentioning that.)

murph@hotpotatomail.com

and Yes, it realy is "hotpotatomail".
