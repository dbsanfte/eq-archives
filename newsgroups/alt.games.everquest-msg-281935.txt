Could be a luck of the draw. My Ranger, Necromancer and Enchanter often
get the same tasks offered, as do my SK and my wife's monk. There's
defenitely tasks the enchanter and necro can do that the ranger just
has all kinds of trouble with, and vice-versa, but they do eventually
all get offered if I pester the task master enough.
