I like the old DOS games, and lots of them are NOT compatible with my SB 
Live sound card. That do not mean i try to sue either the game 
developers or Creative Labs for not making it compertible.

At some point you HAVE to make a stand and stop supporting the old 
hardware/software, because its simply outdated.
Win 95 have been outdated since 1998, and now Microsoft decided to make 
DirectX not compatible any more, and VI decided to use DirectX 8.1. So 
what, no big deal in deciding not to support a SO outdated system any more.
If you compate the technological advanced in computers to cars for 
example, using Win 95 is like using a car from 1930 or so. Would you 
also demand that manifactureres always keep making spare parts so they 
can make your car keep running, although its so outdated?
