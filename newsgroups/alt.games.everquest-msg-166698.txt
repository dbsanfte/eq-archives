I would agree with you on most things except for the fact that it is a
free market.  Location is not what makes the market free, after all
the tunnel in EC was the free market for a time.

No government controls on what can be bought or sold, traded, or
crafted is what makes a market free.  Freedom to ply your trade and/or
wares without intereference from government.  I take your reference to
the theory of capitalism as it applies to government as a good one.
Capitalism is not in and of itself anything except a theory, one which
applies primarily to governments.

In the complete absense of government, capitalism is the natural
state.  Of course, this assumes peaceful co-existance and not a
takeover by some band of individuals or groups, hence creating
government again.

As to SoE supported market, only in that the world is theirs.  In
truth, even pure capitalism will have taxes.  The difference is that
there is no government intervention in the market pricing at all, but
there's no requirement for the government to provide the venue for
free.
