Yep. It's actually more like walking into a no-smoking lounge and
lighting up a cigar, while thumbing your nose at all the people in
there when they object and point you to the no smoking sign. Which, in
this case, would be the newsgroup FAQ and the unspoken taboos.

When left with no factual support, people who know they are wrong have
to fall back on something, and for this fellow its the feeling that he
is a "rebel against the system".
