I "pulled" the mob over to the dock area, between that big rock and the
tent/shack area.  I guess the wedding was within range to "hear" the fight
because they all started shouting to be quiet and there was a wedding going
on, sending me and my cleric friend tells to "shut the hell up" and stuff
like that.

I could see being yelled at if they had done at least a shout or ooc telling
everybody that a wedding was being held at the docks, but nither of us heard
a thing and we had been there for a little over an hour.

I wouldn't have pulled to that area if my friend wasn't sitting at the
tent... I USUALLY DO run to the zone point if I end up getting aggro'd by a
big group that I can't handle... but in this case, he was sitting there.
