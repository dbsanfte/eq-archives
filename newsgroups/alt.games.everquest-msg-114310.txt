Wah. Life isn't fair. It's their dollar they're worried about. Of the
people that will quit over patching, they risk losing more if they run
patches during times that inconvenience the majority of players.

Incidently, "inconvenience" isn't really an appropriate term here. How
is your life being hampered by not being able to play a game? If it's
such an integral part of your life that not being able to play it a
couple times out of the month is such an inconvenience, you really
ought to seek help...
