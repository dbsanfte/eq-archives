Ok, I have not yet been to JP with "any" of my characters...
as I understand it there are two port ins...... one from SFG and the
other from BB....  
so whats the difference between the two port ins? What races/classes
should use which port?  Whats on the other side... is it a hot port
in? 
I ask because I have an Iksar Monk, Dwarven Rogue, Wood Elf Druid,
Eurdite Necro......    all of various levels...
Oh, and what level and below should "NOT" go to JP?

as usual your time is appreciated.
