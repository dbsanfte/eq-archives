The situation I'm experiencing atm is sort of strange, or at least I think it
is...  so bear with me...

I'm Co-Leader of a Guild.  Not a huge Guild, but a nice, friendly, family
guild...  We are just starting our raiding careers in fact.  :)

At anyrate, there has been a slight disturbance in the guild as of the last few
days.  These things happen and you move on... np...  But now, one of my
officers has removed at least one of her alternate toons and put them in a
different guild.

It didn't occur to me to be upset by this at all, until it was called to my
attention that as an officer, this person should be held to a little higher
standard and expected to show a bit more loyalty to the guild than moving her
alts to another guild.

So basically, I wondering what the general concensus here in the ng is...  

Thanks for the advice in advance, you guys are really awesome!  :)
