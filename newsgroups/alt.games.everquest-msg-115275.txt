...I was on the boat to Butcherblock.  Goofing around, I managed to fall off
the boat.  Thinking, "Well, this is sweet" I dove underwater thinking to end
my suffering quickly.  Wayyyy in the distance I made out what looked like an
island.  So I began a long swim.  I eventually did end up on an island that
was filled with bird like creatures.    They conned red to me at 4, and were
indifferent. I saw only one other person on the island, and this guy was
whacking 'em. They couldn't even put up a fight to this guy.  After about
ten minutes I noticed that he wasn't looting the corpses.  After asking and
being told to help myself, I picked up about ten plat in ten minutes.  Does
anyone know the name of this island?  How to get there (the right way)?
