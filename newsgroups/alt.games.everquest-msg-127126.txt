Some messages are useful, of course.  Some messages are
essential, even.  Some messages, on the other hand, are
nothing except spam.  An assisting message is spam in the
vast majority of cases.  Do you have a caster character
with a "medding" hotkey you spam every ten seconds?

Note that an "assisting" hotkey is totally different than
an "assist me" hotkey.  There's simply little reason to
announce to the group that you're assisting someone.  Well,
except in the cases where you're assisting the wrong person
and the group's looking to kick the moron who keeps breaking
mez out...

Yeah, that's cute.  Once.  *Maybe* even twice.  But
it's reason to avoid grouping with you about the tenth
time.  And remember how cute it is when someone doesn't
see your mend message because your assist message caused
it to scroll off the screen and you die while they're
waiting for you to use mend...
