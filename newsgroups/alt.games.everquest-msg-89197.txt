Hardly. We only have *one* serious "uber guild" on our server, and it's
already turning into a minor PITA dealing with bigger stuff we want to
try. I can't imagine dealing with a server with five or six of them. The
tier two guilds would *never* get any further and you'd be forced to try
to qualify to join one of them, or transfer off the server.

Note: I put uber guild in "quotes" because we do have two other old
guilds that would qualify under most definitions. But they are smaller,
composed of entirely 59-60, seem to play at odd hours compared to us
(Asian guilds) and you hardly ever see or hear from them, say nothing of
have problems with them. The real ubers on various servers (from my web
browsing, anyway) seem to be the ones with nearly identical news web
pages talking in dood speak about their latest accomplishments (and
"yawning" about them, etc.) and are basically intent on making sure they
are in the right place at the right time to nail everything worth
getting as soon as it's up. Of course, having the manpower, experience,
and tactics, they can do it. If you want to throw a "jealous" tag on me,
make it of them, not Stormhammer. I think that server is going to be a
nightmare even for the ubers, and an endless headache for the GMs who
will have to settle their endless petty disputes, arguments, KSing,
camp/raid jumping, fighting, training, etc.

And yes, I agree with you. Every split server from here on out will
likely have the same thing. The only place it wouldn't happen, IMO,
would be on a non-split new blue server. But EQ's population doesn't
look to be growing fast enough anymore that we're likely to see one of
those any time soon.
