	Actually no, the ARROW hits the target, not the bow.

	They recently made changes to the Archery system that will allow bows to
have procs, and a few such have appeared in Velious.  Unfortunately those
changes also broke Archery; arrows now often disappear into hyperspace after
firing, or plunge straight into the ground after firing.  If there is the
slightest bit of elevated terrain between you and the target, the arrow will
hit THAT and not the target, regardless of whether or not the actual
line-of-fire is unobstructed.

	Until the last patch, which removed the recycle on weapon delay after
casting for hybrids, attempting to fire after casting would grey out your bow
for a delay cycle and consume an arrow, but not fire.

	And ever since Trueshot was "fixed" I've gotten far fewer critical hits
than I used to.
