I like the functionality a mouse provides and am used to the WASD
directional keys configuration, but I find it difficult sometimes to
hit the right mapped keys for other functions.

I've heard people mention the Strategic Commander from Microsoft. Is
that controller useful to those who do not play bards? Are there any
other game controllers that anyone here has used with EQ with any
satisfaction that put more of the control at your fingertips, so to
speak?

Thanks. Looking to spend some birthday money. :)
