Hmmm personal experience on a few, watching others on the others:
EQ: 8
Jumpgate, TRI: 2.5
SWG: 3
FFXI: 9-9.5. Past 30 soloing is so slow as to be pointless from what I
understand.. I can believe it, it's slow now (15-20)
Observed behavior in others I know:
AC: 1.1 (6 people that I know played AC a bunch. The ONLY times they grouped
was with each other, and then all 6 complained about it bitterly)
AC2: 2.0
CoH: 5
DAoC: 6
E&B: 1.5
