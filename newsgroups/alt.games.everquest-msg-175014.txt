A lame complaint.  If you don't make sure everybody knows the group's
loot policy on entry and boot anybody who refuses to get with the
program you have only yourself to blame.

Aye, a tiny bit of foresight and courtesy and this would become a
rare occurence.

You learn solo and duo tactics, not group tactics.

I seriously doubt that you will find many (or even any) players who
are both melees by preference and enjoy standing around with their
thumb up their butt.  You demanded that the Warrior behave in a way
that's completely alien to him.  You did this because you know solo
and homogenous duo tactics for rotting, but apparently have no clue
as to how to use a Warrior effectively.  What you should've done was
to have the Warrior constantly on the move, pulling Giants and holding
them in place while you casters got them all done up the way you like,
and then heading right back out to (1) kill any lizard he sees on HG
hill (they are PHs), (2) kill any Basilisk there for the same reason,
(3) pull Cyclopses to you guys for easy disposal (also PHs), (4) either
kill or pull Giant Skeletons (depending on how hard they are for him to
kill) (more PHs), and (5) last but very definitely not least (or even
last anywhere but in this list for that matter) pull another HG for
you guys to work your magic on.  [The order of the preceding is not
special, not listing priorities just distinguishing tasks.]  There is
no reason that a pair of Druids couldn't keep a couple of HGs ripening
on the vice, so to speak, and you guys should've been going LOM only
because the Warrior was finding lots of HGs for you to kill (he would
need only an occasional Heal if you used him in this fashion).  In
essence, you guys cop a Necro-type attitude and lay back in your
lounge chairs waiting for the HG(s) you've got to die while your valet
is off fetching more.
So, in summary, your tactics sucked.  Both in terms of the Warrior's
psychology and in terms of how fast you could've been killing HGs.

You understand that your mana should be being used to kill mobs, but
you failed to translate that into an effective plan of action.

There ya go, another pair of Druids who have no clue how to group
effectively.  Go ahead and enjoy yourselves, but don't imagine that
your pretense does much of a job of concealing your ignorance.
