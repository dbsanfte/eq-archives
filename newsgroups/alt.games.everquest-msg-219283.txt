(You responded)
Well I gave a more detailed answer as to what it is that makes me
prefer UO to EQ further down, but I can say that I've played EQ for a
year and it hasn't inspired in me the excitement and interest that UO

Sure sounds to me like "but I can say that I've played EQ for a year" is in
direct response to "If you've gone ahead and invested in getting EQ, you
might want to at least give it a chance." (corrected spelling)

If that was not what you meant, then I'm sorry I misunderstood.
