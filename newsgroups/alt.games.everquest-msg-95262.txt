  You will be able to do those things in the Overthere outpost (so various
Kunark spots may work for you).  You also might be accepted in the Qeynos and
Freeport undergrounds, though I'm not sure about that.

  You'll be KOS in Paineel and Halas.  You can fix your faction with all of
Paineel if you kill enough kobolds, but it'll take you a while to get there.

  I don't really have any great insights about where you might want to hunt
through those levels.  Lavastorm might be good from 12-20 or so.
