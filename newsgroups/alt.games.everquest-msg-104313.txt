The term has been around for a long while as an insult "you gimp" ie "you
moron" etc but gained fame, notoriety and geek chic from the film pulp
fiction. The gimp being some guy dressed up in full rubber/leather (full
mask included) S&M gear.
It has now become one of those terms that it just in any situation that can
be found for it, it is a derogatory term so if applied to a person, object
or area it is not a good thing.

CF
No idea if the word was associated with S&M slaves before Pulp Fiction or
not.
