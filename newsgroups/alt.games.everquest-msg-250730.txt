So what?

They came back. All of them, or near enough. It's not a matter of not
seeing who didn't. Poor analogy.

These are mmorpgs and therefore warrant comparing to each other,
regardless of anyone's personal feelings towards them.

AO *was* a failure for a long time. AC never got much of a population.
By some standards those nebulous "posts" you are alluding to were
right, and in any event neither situation remotely resembles what I
just said. I didn't call CoH a failure, I said the EQ players I know
went to it have come back.

No need to get so defensive if in the end you agree I may be right.

At no time did I say every person anywhere who played CoH has come
back to EQ.

I'd say the problem is you misinterpreted what "it" was, since I am
not searching for "it". I am commenting on other people thinking that
CoH was "it", that is, the EQ killer all the haters love to watch for.

Your defensiveness is intriguing. Does this post threaten you in some
way? Does a post that is not 100% positive towards CoH demand
immediate confrontation? There isn't even anything in my post you can
contradict, since it is freely admitted to being anecdotal and
personal.

I suggest you relax yourself.
