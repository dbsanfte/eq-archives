I'm assuming you mean Athlon by AMD.  I have the 700MHz CPU and have not
noticed nor heard about any incompatibilities with any program I'm like to
ever use (and can't remember any programs it's not compatible with).

I haven't been keeping up with the AMD models...last I knew, Athlon was
their best model and I think Duron was the cheap version.  I don't know what
the Thunderbird is when it comes to caching, etc.

My next CPU will definitely be an AMD.  I don't want to spend the lots of
extra money required to buy an Intel.
