1. The level 60 game is not the same as level 50 game.
2. You have not acquired 200 levels over 2 years so dont even add it that
way. What you have done is made a char leveled to 50 and realised you wanted
to try another char.

3. Being a powergamer is not being an idiot. We are in most cases the best
marketing tools Verant has. Not just to people not playing EQ but to people
also playing EQ. When low levels clicked on my war and asked me a zillion
questions. I sat down (if I had the time) and told our adventures in velious
/ luclin / kunark.

4. Theres a feeling of accomplishment when you walk the towns and people
stop you by to take a snapshot of you because thats the way they want thier
char to be when they are 60 and have aaxp points etc. Or when they ask you
for class based advice etc. Especially when the say "hey, you post on the
steelwarrior forums, how you doing bud".

People have fun at different levels but for me high level raiding is where
it the game becomes fun for me. If you think I am an idiot go ahead. Atleast
I have pushed the limits of my avatar before he was hacked. Starting over as
a rogue is just as fun though.
