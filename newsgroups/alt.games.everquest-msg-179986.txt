    I go one further than the suggestions so far:

    I have 2 hotkeys for sense heading, one is mapped to forward with the
alternate mapped to reverse, the other is mapped to left and right.

    This is great because:

    a) you learn your skill 4x faster
    b) *any* time you move at all your skill activates, which makes your
compass laser accurate for a few seconds. *very* useful for getting out of
the woods when the Wrong Mob aggros you...
