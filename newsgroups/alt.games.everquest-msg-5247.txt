Yeesh.. I'm starting to think that LOIO is the *only* zone for the 20's.. at
least from reading this newsgroup! :-)  I soloed my Iksar monk to 22 or so
in The Overthere and then moved to LOIO.  I'm at level 26 now and can't wait
to leave! Not only is there always 85-115 people in the zone, but I don't
see what's really so great about it. You need to turn off /ooc and /shout
most of the time or you'll go nuts. The lag can be terrible. All of the
popular hunting spots always have a full group or two (or three!).  Maybe
it's just the Iksar exp penalty, but I get zippo from killing blues in a
full group. I mean, I think we killed 5 or 6 right in a row, and I *maybe*
got 1/4 of a blue bubble. Maybe. And, I didn't see much of anything in the
way of loot. So, I soloed from 22 - 25 at the lake near the windmill, then
got to 26 at the goblin mines. Now, that's a spot that usually empty.

There HAVE to be some other zones for the 20's... once I get that darn
Sarnak Courier I'm gonna go find some!...
