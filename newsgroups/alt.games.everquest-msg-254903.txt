With dimishing returns:

My airpet alone is responsible for slowing a mob ~20%
My BL alone is responsible for slowing a mob ~65%

The 2 together get it to around ~72%  IE the 20% from
stuns is 20% of its slowed DPS (35% of normal) = 7%.

Also, since it's hard to coordinate so stunners alternate,
adding another stunner yields still lower returns.

I need to parse out Rellic someday - subjectively it
procs pretty darn often.

The combination of Sha's Revenge, airpet stun and rellic
appear to keep mob damage incredibly low - all things considered.
