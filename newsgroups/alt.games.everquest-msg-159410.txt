They have just as much a chance to get stuff, per raid, as you do.  The
difference is that since they attend more raids, their chances come closer
together than yours do.  But the loot/raid ratio between them and you will
be roughly the same.

Or are you actually proposing that people that raid LESS OFTEN get
preferential treatment in looting?

So you think you should get points for "having a life?"

How is it unfair?  Those who contribute more get more points.  Need more
points?  Come to more raids.  Can't come to more raids?  Sorry, that's your
problem, not mine.

That's the theory.  And in theory, there is no difference between theory and
practice.  But in practice, there is.

What this leads to is people only going to those specific raids where stuff
they want drops.  And NBG always comes down to want, not need.

And then you see things like someone who's been going on the last dozen
raids hoping to get that desperately needed upgrade that will help the guild
move to the next tier lose the roll to someone that only raids once a month. 

Good for him perhaps, but NOT good for the guild.

Again, the CHARACTER gets points for showing up more often.

It sounds to me like your guild isn't fitting your play style very well. 
Perhaps you should join another one that is a closer match.
