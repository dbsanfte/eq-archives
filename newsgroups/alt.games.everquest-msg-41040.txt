I hope they find the motherfucker and kill his whole family, and then cut
off his arms and legs and keep him alive in a torture facility and we can
have OUR fun. Maybe we can laugh in the streets some. From this  day

benlatan(sp?) promised us he was going to make a statement. He threatened
us, and a week later this happens. We need to start sending the message that
we don't take shit and will will kick some camel fucking ass
