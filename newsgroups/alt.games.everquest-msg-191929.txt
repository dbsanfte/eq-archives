}waste.

I don't think there is such a site, exactly.  I think word rarity varies 
from server to server.  mythiran.allakhazam.com has recipes for all the 
old-style, pre-Legacy of Ykesha words, and there you can see which ones 
are for 'research only' spells.  RO words are worth a bit more, of course.  
Most spells take two components to research, but some take 3, and some of 
the new LoY research takes 4.

Word/page drops seem to vary like this:  In any given area, say Netherbian 
Lair, a particular set of words and pages are likely to drop.  The words 
and pages are for spells generally 3-5 levels below the average local 
mob level.  In any given local set, if you find one component for a 
particular spell, you are unlikely to find the other matching component.  
Presumably, this is to make sure all casters have to go hunt in marus seru 
and echo as well as netherbian. :)

So generally, there is some page or word that drops mostly in an area 
or two that is not too frequently camped on your particular server.  So if 
you wanna get rare words, figure out where the people aren't, and hunt 
there.  Which is generally pretty good advice anyway, if you don't like 
being trained and KSed and listening to morons in /ooc. :)

This theory of research component drops is my own, based on farming 6.8 
million mobs for tradeskills and keeping all the research drops (since, 
hey, research is a tradeskill too!) So if you want a cite for it, there 
ain't one, sorry. :)
