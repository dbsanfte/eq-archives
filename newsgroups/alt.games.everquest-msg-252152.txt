That isn't a license to post whatever you want whenever you want, you
know. OT is tolerated in moderation, and who posts it is taken into
consideration. No one knows you from jack and the many CoH posts are
getting tiresome though they finally seem to be dying away.

So you might want to ease off calling other people "jack ass" before
you get yours handed to you by someone.
