If you go to a place that doesn't sell chicken salad sandwich, and you get a
tuna salad sandwich, then it's your fault for not looking at the menu.

I'd say there's no room to complain.  The locations of the druid rings and
wizard spires are well known.  If some guy in leather armor offers to
transport you, then you know you're not getting directly to Gfay.  If the
guy's wearing robes, then you're golden.  If you don't know the difference
between a duid and a wizard, then a two minute run through a green zone is a
very minor price to pay.
