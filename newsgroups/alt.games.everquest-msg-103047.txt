No, I haven't heard of DTs...  But guess what...  If Alcohol was a major
addictive substance, like say... Smoking...  Why is it, then, people who
are Alcoholics, have a way to get back from their addiction similar to the
way Gamblers do?  Why isn't there an over the counter or prescription patch
to help step down their addictive issues?  Probably because it isn't as
severe as smoking or normal drugs which literally force you to retake it to
get rid of that bad feeling.

Another thing to consider, if Alcohol is "majorly" addictive...  How come
we don't have more shitfaced or majorly disabled people from alcohol abuse.
We have more people drinking Alcohol than we do people pumping some sort of
drug into their body to get high.  Why is there a large majority of the
alcohol drinking people able to still drive or be coherent, when, by all
rights and definition, they should be off their keysters drunk and/or
passed out from abusing it.

Personally, it is a matter of self control and common sense.  If we need to
stick some damn label warning people something they should have the common
sense to know when to stop and when put it away...  We should stick it on
every god damn thing people can get addicted or abuse as well.  Then go
'ba-ba-ba' like the sheep we are.
