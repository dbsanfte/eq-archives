Exactly why I name my characters the way I do.  If  you
see a female on Drinal with whose name starts with "Tea"
and end with a short, descriptive to the class word, 
there's an excellent chance you're looking right at 
me.
    I'm not surprised that the tracking limit on druids
was raised.  A level of 50 is certainly better than nothing,
but not all that stellar.  I admit, I am surprise that
they lack the tracksort feature.  Yikes.

Annie  <--- Has tracksort set to distance, and like it that way

-- 
Living in the universe known as Drinal

Tealeef -- Barbarian Shaman of 19 seasons.

Teacure -- Halfling Cleric of 12 doses.
Teacast -- High Elf Enchanter of 6 circles.
