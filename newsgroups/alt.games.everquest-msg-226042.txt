I'd love that idea, nothing bugs the hell out of me more than you do
some quest and get as good as nothing for it. When I started EQ I
didnt know about allakhazam and stuff, and blindly played, if an NPC
asked me to do something when I said Hi, I thought it would be worth
it, the amount of times I died, bust a gut, spent days doing stuff
only to wish I just told em to shove it.

If when you started your guild master handed you a charm (for some
service) you could start this, and the idea of +1 sv something, for
each quest you did and got a vaguely relevant skill, so, you get some
guy his bow or wood for it, or string, or arrows or some such, you get
either a 1% fletching bonus or archery bonus or something.. It would
be a hell of a way to make people want to do something
