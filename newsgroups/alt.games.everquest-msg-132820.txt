All right, we've established a lower bound on your answer.  Is 7 yrs 
old TOO young?

Or, rather than me saying a number, and you saying yes or no, why don't 
you just ask yourself.  Go up the list of ages, and when you get to one 
you don't firmly believe is TOO young, stop and report the result.

You'd jump off a bridge to escape a nuclear missile?  Rather die by 
massive bellyflop, and -then- be disassociated into your component atoms?  
Or do you somehow think the bottom of the bridge is significantly further 
from ground zero?  Oh, no, wait, I see... you want to be underwater so 
you're -boiled alive- rather than being vaporized.  I get it now.

I think your time could more costructively be spent, in those 
circumstances, kissing your ass goodbye.  Or maybe finding last-minute 
religious solace.

But god forbid you should come up with a different answer than the rest of 
the lemmings, I guess.  Well, you did say you'd only consider it, I'll 
give ya that.
