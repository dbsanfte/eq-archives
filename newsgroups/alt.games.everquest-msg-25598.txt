Hmmm, fighting Giant Tump in FM with my shaman, and a rogue friend.  First
thing I do is Malise, then Tagar's.  Not really watching, hit F8.  A bit
later, I notice, the text saying that I feel vulnerable, and something to
the affect that I slow down.  Doh!!!  We had to zone that one.  Fortunately,
we were fighting near the LoIO zone.  The giant was right in front of me
when I hit F8, the targetting just seems to get screwy sometimes.  I really
need to remember to always hit ESC first, just to be safe.
