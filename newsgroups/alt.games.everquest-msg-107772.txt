Which "it"?  If you mean the PGT, I was told it procs at Level 10.  I
don't know for sure.  However, I do know that it was proc'ing for my
Level 17 Paladin.

(Had it go off 7 times in one fight.  Can you say "no damage taken",
children?  I knew you could!)

As for the 1HB weapons, why should I quash your search for knowledge?
Allaka-ZOT!  Err, Allakhazam.
