Two things are going on.

1. You are probably right that a *lot* of people are higher level, and so in
zones you shouldn't be in (or can't be in...such as planes).  I remember,
back before Sony disabled the "count" commands, doing some checks, and the
player distribution usually was this: a big group of 1-10, fairly small
groups of 11-20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, and a big group of 51-60.  That was a
long time ago, and the distribution is probably even more skewed now.

2. At your level, there are a LOT more places to hunt nowadays than there
used to be.  People are more spread out.

Sony occasionally makes claims about the number of subscribers, and those
claims are almost certainly accurate--they are a public company, and could
get in BIG trouble if they lied about things like that.
