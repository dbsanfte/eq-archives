There's a Miles Sound Driver bug that can do that with the current crop of 
Creative drivers (Audigy, SBLive) as well as the drivers for some other 
cards.  This is the first I've heard of it being an issue with Everquest 
in particular, but it wouldn't surprise me if that was the story.  I wrote 
an app called SpeakerGuard that switches you back to surround as soon as 
it's switched away, effectively working around the bug.  It's at 
http://www.snarksoft.com/ with a link on the front page.
