I've known something was wrong, just didn't know how to fix it.  Got a long
KEI thread out of that, though.  Problem fixed, and I can now run both of my
accounts over one dial up phone line, no more lag then usual except when
zoning, got my druid 34 because I was able to stay on for a decent amount of
time.

Merry Christmas everyone.
