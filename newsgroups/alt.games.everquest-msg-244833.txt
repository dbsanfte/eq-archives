Having tried everywhere I can, I haven't been able to get the N52, abd
bought an n45 instead. The macroing language seems painful and undocumented.
I can't figure out how to get it to loop yet, although I have managed to do
simple things like type a phrase in notepad. Does anyone have this
controller and know if it can be used to loop?
