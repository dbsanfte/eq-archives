So we have a great new computer sitting upstairs. It works beautifully,
cable connection is super fast, and runs Star Wars Galaxies without a
hitch, so my fiancï¿½ is very happy. I, however, am not happy, because it
won't run EQ, so I'm stuck on the mediocre downstairs computer when I
want to play. Everything works fine on the new comp until I enter my
user name and password and hit connect, when it tells me EQ.exe has
encountered a problem and needs to shut down. Any thoughts? It's running
Windows XP home, if that helps, and... um... I'm not sure what else
you'd need to know to diagnose this (not real technical, sorry).

Thanks in advance for any suggestions you all can offer.
