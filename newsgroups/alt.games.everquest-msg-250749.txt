I've been giving a lot of thought to this myself - being both a cleric and a
druid.  No.  I don't think *I* would be upset if there was suddenly a *rez* guy
in each zone.  My ranger has died many times in strange out of the way places
and had to *eat* those deaths.  She really didn't lose any sleep over those
deaths as she enjoys exploring more than experiencing.
As far as *rez stones* that you could buy?  I don't like the idea.  The very
rich will have them - the very poor will not.  
*Temperance* is *not* a money maker - well, not enough that *I* choose to do
it.  (If everyone donated 20 plat I would profit 8 plat and change for each
one.  *IF*.  Now that I have aego I find that buffing my group has become
*more* expensive.  Some want aego, some want symbol, some still want temp,
trying to keep them all straight is maddening.  Some don't care to have any HP
buff, I give them whatever *group* buff is most appropriate.)
You *can* buy "greater concentration" potions now, and a couple other mana
enhancers, and I *do* buy them for emergency use, they are pretty pricey.  I
still pay for my KEIs too.
My necro is too young to have an opinion, but I *have* used the services of a
couple of very nice necros.  I'm guessing most of the *race to the top* players
won't have an opinion on that either, they only play in zones where you repop
at the zoneline anyway <--- bad attempt at humor.
