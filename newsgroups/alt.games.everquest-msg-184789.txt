    Not like the clerics do, no, not really.

    He likely looked at the mana regen of the three priest classes and
figured out which one can regen mana the slowest. You don't even need to try
and figure out which might be doing the task the raid depends on most.

    And they can get that mana back in a very short time with Cann5. Giving
them FT doesn't appreciably increase their total mana regen rate.

    Funny you should mention that fight. The shaman buffs before the fight
(has plenty of time to regen the mana), then must keep two spells on
Emperor. Anything else they do is gravy. Those clerics are in CH chain or
spam-healing MT/RT the entire fight. Who is the mana regen bottleneck here?

    Unless you keep the RT up with druid heals only, none of these tasks are
as critical as what the clerics are doing. If a druid goes down, res them
back up. If a cleric goes down, people start shouting "ADJUST!" If you're
outside, the druid's mana regen is going to be higher than that of the
cleric, too.

> Tell me why those utilities don't enable them to ask for FT loot?

    They can always ask. But if the guild is trying to gear up for higher
encounters, they're better off with the FT going to the clerics until they
hit cap, all other factors being equal. If the guild is just killing to have
fun, and they'll get there when they get there, then by all means award
based on the usual factors like time put in, etc. It all depends on what
you're trying to accomplish.
