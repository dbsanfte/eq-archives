skulking brutes in warsliks woods (outside dalnir)
they do not agro or assist each other. stay there till 35.

then hit ot. try and group imo. solo with your lfg tag on and occasionally
do a shout. only accept invites to well rounded groups cos you are better
off soloing unless the group is efficient. dont use that venom of the snake
when grouped. it will get you killed.
