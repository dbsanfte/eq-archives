The skulking brutes in Warslik wood.
zone in fron the overthere, and head north along the zone wall. if you hit
water, you've gone too far. location is about + 3500, +3900. good luck!

With a ranger, you can "bow kite." Snare (not root) and start shootin! if
fighting an animal, panic it too. If you're feeling really frisky, befriend
an animal and use it as a pet. turn off taunt, too. Squeeze all you can out
of your class. Lastly, pick up some silver chittin hand wraps. they'll haste
you and help out immensly.
