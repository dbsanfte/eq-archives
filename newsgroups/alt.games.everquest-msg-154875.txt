Bards solo usually through one of three forms of kiting:

Fear Kiting: Snare, fear, fight (usually mixing in 1 chant), rinse, repeat
(watch the aggro though since our fear is AOE)
Charm Kiting: Charm a mob, have it attack another mob. Help your pet win,
but only enough that your pet is an easy kill for you when charm breaks.
Swarm kiting is really just a variant on this where you have several mobs
attacking your pet at the same time.
Chant Kitting: Snare or Selo's, stay out of range (often by running in
circles but some terrian requires back and forth past the mob), hit it with
1, 2, or 3 chants to DoT it to death.

Which to use is really a matter of preference, where you're at, how much
mana you have, etc., etc., etc.. Personally, I usually pick places where I
can both charm and chant kite. I primarily charm kite until mana is down,
then chant kite while I'm waiting for mana to build back up (which takes
forever with a bard). I still use fear kiting (which is really all you have
for a time when you're younger) when I'm in enclosed spaces.

Basically, bards are usually looking for running room (or AoE buffer room)
when they solo. If you stick to chant kiting and have enough room, a good
bard and solo yellows and reds as long as they are melee only.
