I like "bublets".

Now, when you get 5 orange bubbles, it's called "DING" to next level.

What does 5 bublets get you ? Do you "chime" into the next bubble ? "Dong"
doesn't seem appropriate, but goes with "ding" like "bublet" goes with
"bubble".

What about "/guildsay Dinglet ! I just filled an orange bubble ! Five more
bubblets and I'm 52nd !!"
