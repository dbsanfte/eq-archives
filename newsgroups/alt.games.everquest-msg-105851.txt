Yeh my shaman has his boots. If BD ain't up you need to kill the advisor to
make BD spawn.
He wasn't kos to me so you can pull him and run to the zone. Be warned he
will HT ya.
Reason to run to zone is that if any of his friends aggro, they will return
to their spawn spots while BD will hang around at the zoneline, so when ya
zone back in he won't kos ya and ya can keep doing this until he's dead.
He has a pretty good regen rate but as long as you are doing damage to him
it should be easy enough.
He's pretty resistant to shaman spells (including disease, even after he was
disease debuffed). A tactic we found worked good was to kite him with a
druid or ranger as snare stuck and he was so pissed at being snared that he
pretty much ignored the rest of us beatin the hide offa him. Experiment with
levels/classes vs him, I did this for the second time with a 51 druid, 52
shaman 49 ranger and my 52 monk. That was slightly overkill, as he was very
easy with the kiting method.
Hope this helps ya - those boots rock!!
