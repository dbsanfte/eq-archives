This was a nice analogy but it is wrong on a few points. First of all,
EQ did not take a while to catch on. It was instantly extremely
popular, so much so that the initial projections for people signing in
were far beyond what Verant expected and they spent the first month
scrambling to add bandwidth and servers. EQ got a *lot* of hype; it
was no sudden flash. It got a huge boost from the horde of people who
were dissatisfied from UO - this newsgroup was formed by those people,
as some of us here remember well.

Secondly attrition has been holding at the same pace as new
subscribers, or near enough, for at least a year and probably more
than two. EQ has been in your "plateau phase" for a long time now. And
not only that, the players coming in are of a completely different
attitude than the players leaving, in general - the ones coming in are
far less tolerant of anything that isn't raw action and therefore toss
out words like "timesinks" and "casual players" with alarming
frequency.

And another consequence of the changing demographics of the playerbase
- the current players are more fickle and less likely to stay, which
is probably why expansions have gotten smaller and more common, a race
to keep these newer people interested longer, knowing they get bored
faster and move on quicker than what EQ had to deal with in its first
two years.

More instant gratification. Luclin, LoY, PoP, LDoN, they were all
pushes in that direction, more and more.

It isn't going to ever reach plateau status at any high level again.
EQ is on a big downswing. I suspect it will plateau again a few months
after WoW is released, at a much lower subscriber level, perhaps 100k,
definately below DAoC (because DAoC will keep the PvP players until
something comes out that does it better).

You're right, but you're behind. A lot of what you are predicting has
already been going on.
