No, its not Winme doing it. If his 9.99 jewel case version does that,
it must be a newer thing that version of EQ does with screenshots.
However.. since the patcher often patches the *.exe file from EQ it
must be some other kind of file that id denoting which file type to
save the screenshot as, or perhaps it checks the type before patching
and a person with that jewelcase one gets a slightly different exe. I
don't really doubt this a lot since I also heard you can't use a
tutorial mode in that jewelcase one.

Its rather odd that EQ does that without asking though since of course
the jpgs will be much lower quality than the larger bmps.

In the meantime though, get irfanview.

http://www.irfanview.com/

Its a totally freeware (at least for personal use) graphics displaying
and converting program with things like slideshow and lots of cool
stuff. Essentially its as good or better than LviewPro or whatever
that kept wanting to be registered to use and other crap. 
Irfanview has a very nice "batch" conversion mode and after testing it
on one for the quality you want you can convert all those bmps to jpgs
then you can delete the bmps.
