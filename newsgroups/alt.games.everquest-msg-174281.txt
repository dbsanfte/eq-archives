Greetings.

Is it just me, or is there an experience modifier in Dawnshroud peaks?
 I'll give you an example.  With my level 40 bard I was swarm kiting
(with charm song) the Frost Giants and Drakkel Dire Wolves in the
Great Divide.  My swarm typically consisted of 5 - 8 mobs at any given
time of either giants or wolves.  After an hour of doing this swarm
kiting I gained a yellow bubble of experience. By doing this, 40 flew
by really quickly.

At 41 I find myself in Dawnshroud peaks.  I'm casually hunting
Zelniaks and wolves by either doing a two chant kite or my charm.  I'm
not doing the swarm kiting because Dawnshoud can be laggy for me. 
After 45 minutes I gained a yellow bubble.  I don't know about you,
but a yellow bubble in 45 minutes at 41 seems really quick.  In both
instances there was no downtime.  Hey, I'm not complaining but I am
wondering if anyone else has noticed faster xp in dawnshroud.  Swarm
kiting using my charm is an easy way to get quick xp but I thought it
was unusual that dawnshroud was faster without doing a swarm kite. 
Has anyone else noticed a quicker xp rate in dawnshroud?  On Brell, it
seems that Dawnshroud has become the new LOIO with uber d00ds KS'ing
and being childish in /ooc.  I'm glad that /ooc can be turned off.
