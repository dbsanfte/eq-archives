I'd wager it is.  Here's another way to generate the same message -
hold an item on the cursor and try to select a spell to mem -
you get the same message.  In my case is was a waterstone (all/all)
in hand on my cleric while I was trying to mem Ressurection.

(was rezzing a guy in the grey, so I had a waterstone in hand
to give him so he could EB himself)
