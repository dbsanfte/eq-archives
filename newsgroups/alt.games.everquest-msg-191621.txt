I think you misunderstand, it wasnt a criticism. Nostalgia is a kind of
rose tinted affection for the past, how things were. As a player since
beta I found a kind of longing, affectionate rememberance of how things
were inspired by the explanations given by that site. They are undeniably
out of date, but my comment wasnt criticising them for that or claiming
to do better... more trying to share that feeling of rememberance with
the other members of the group.

I liked it when befallen was terrifying and the bone bladed claymore
was sought after. I bet others here remember it with similar fondness.

Matt
