Oh I don't know. If a NBG policy is something you feel is of paramount
importance in a guild, and you find that the guild you've joined doesn't
have that policy (or enforce it) I'd say that's a pretty valid reason to
resign.

Yes, I do understand that people should research a guild before joining, but
it doesn't always happen that way.
