Ok, this may sound like a dumb question, but is there a way to get the
items I loot from right clicking on them to into my inventory bags in
a certain order?  For example... have the first item I loot go into
slot 1 of the bag in slot 1... next item in slot 2 of bag one.. so
that the first bag gets filled first, then the bag in slot 2 next and
so on and so forth?  Right now, the loot drops into any bag it feels.

Sorry if this sounds dumb, but if there is a way to accomplish this it
will be of great help to me.  Thank you.  = )
