Doesn't come close to matching any parses I've seen. I think the lvl
55 shaman pet is around 36th lvl (too lazy to look it up) and I just
don't see it doing the same damage in PoN that the high lvl pet does
(that one is 58th lvl). The 58 pet is being parsed consistently at
around 35DPS. If your parse were correct, you'd expect to see 50+ DPS
there from a high lvl shaman pet and that just isn't happening.

20 DPS sounds realistic for both, I dont' think there's much, if any,
level difference between those two pets.
