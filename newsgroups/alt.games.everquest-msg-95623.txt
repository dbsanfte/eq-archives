    You obvious work in higher class places than I ever did.  I was a cook for
ten years, before I switched careers, but I was basically a burger flipper.  We
rarely got the "I'm allergic" line when food was sent back at the local Marie
Callendars, for example.  
    I have run across it in home cooking, though.  I love to cook, and am good
at it.  I once had a dinner party for some friends.  Basically it was a home
tostata bar, where I had made serveral garnishes for the the guests to use in
the construction of their meal.  In the spiced beef, I had used onions.  One
woman told me she was allergic to onions.  I shrugged, and pointed out there
were several other things she could use that were onion free.  Upon realizing
that I wasn't inclined to whip up another batch of spiced beef sans onions, she
mummbled something about "Well, its not that bad of an allergy", then throught
the course of the evening, came back for thirds of that particular dish.  This
is the same woman that, another time, doused my delicatly flavored
chicken-spinach rollups with barbeque sauce.  I... I just realized I'm
rambling.  Sorry.

    Ok, I'm blown away.  Some of the folks at RFC like to see themselves as a
bunch of cozy friends chatting it up around the kitchen table with warm fuzzy
feelings for all, but like any newsgroup that has a core group of regulars there
are unwritten rules and alliances that the sensitive would do well not stir. 
But in general it is a fairly gentle newsgroup (especially compared to this
one).  One sees flame threads there, but not all that often.  But what you got
seems like the equivelent of a newsgrop sniper.  Scary.  I've been on the Usenet
for years, and I still learn things about my peers that amaze me.

   Ah!  So others may have made death threats to you, but you just never
recieved them.  This I can believe.
