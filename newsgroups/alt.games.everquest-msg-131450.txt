To the best of my knowledge, the only reason anyone would worry about Tizmak
faction is so that they are not attacked by any wandering Tizmaks.  It can
be a tad annoying, when these green Tizmaks still insist on attacking you.

The weapons in question are Coldain Velium weapons, price varies depending
on the particular weapon, 100pp plus or minus is the right ballpark anyway.
Not sure about the damage being one higher, they do proc velium shards at
level 1, which is helpful at that level.  Another nice thing, is that like
the dropped Velium weapons, they are magic weapons, and can be used against
creatures such as wisps that are invulnerable to normal weapons.
