Yes, its the Katta song bug... but with the 'fix' it now happens with EVERY 
bard song, not just Katta. So instead of fixing Katta's to work like the 
others, unbugged... they made all the others work like a bugged Katta's.

That is the problem with bards currently.
Any bard that uses a procing weapon, or has a spell/song/effect on them that 
procs... is kinda messed up now.
