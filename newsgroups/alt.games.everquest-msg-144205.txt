Currently I have a rogue in DL working his way up to level 37 which is
when my sword of ykesha will start to proc (for 75dmg if I am not
mistaken).  My hours of play are screwball, and often for only an hour
or so during the week.

For the times when I am the only one in a zone, or unable to get a group
and forced to solo -- I am thinking of picking up a second sword of the
same type.  I figured with these two swords procing fairly often would
really help me cut down mobs.  Since I can't backstab while solo
(excluding intimidation), and drawing agro due to procs is a non issue
as well, is this a good solution killing quicker?  Are there other 1hs
or 1hp gear out there that has a better DD proc then this sword of
ykesha?

Thank you.
