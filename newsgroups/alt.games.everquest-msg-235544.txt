A few friends and I cancelled our SWG accounts, and reactivated our EQ
accounts, but figured we would all start new characters on a different
server.  Xev was the chosen server, and I've got a cleric up to level
20, and a warrior up to 15, but trying to find a group is near
impossible.  The others i started playing with dont play nearly as
much as I do, so grouping with them isnt really an option.  Seems to
be a 'bring your own group' theme here, or just a bunch of low level
people getting pl'd.  

So any tips on zones where you might be able to find a pickup group?
I managed to get a group in PC once, out of the half dozen or so times
i have been there.  

thanks
chuck
