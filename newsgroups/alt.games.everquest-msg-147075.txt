Right at the start of the game I was taught delay/damage.  I mean, come on
now...don't YOU prefer to deal with numbers ABOVE 1?  But I quickly learned
that the standard was damage/delay and to avoid confusion I do it that way.

http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=mana  That's how I pronounce it. :)

Neither, it's spelled "Firiona Vie" so the first name wouldn't start
"free-anything" but more likely "fear-ee-oh-nuh." I'm sure it's stated
somewhere, but I pronounce the surname as the same as the dictionary
pronounces it (http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=vie), right or wrong. :)
