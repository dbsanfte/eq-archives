Well, to be clear, lag can certainly cause significant delays or apparent 
unresponsiveness in the directional controls, or merely just make it a real 
chore to navigate an area withouth looking straight down at the ground. 
This isn't network lag, but graphics lag (whether or not the term "lag" is 
appropriate when discussing graphics, I often hear it used in that 
context), which it seems pretty clear is a problem with the OP's computer.
