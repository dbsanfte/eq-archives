So, you've never seen a mob on a given faction that doesn't give a
faction hit when you kill it? Unnamed CoV mobs in Cobalt Scar, for
instance?
I can't recall ever getting faction changes for killing giants in IC,
but the ones I killed in GD gave -rif/zek, +coldain, + CoV. Doing that
till I was allied with coldain put me roughly at threatening with CoV
(I never checked till after I'd filched faction at a Derakor raid,
which I was told was the equivalent of one faction level. I am dubious
to CoV now)
