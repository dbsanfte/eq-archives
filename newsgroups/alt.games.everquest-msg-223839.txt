My warrior finally got his Fleshsear Cleaver off Heili :)  Both my 
cleric and my buds Druid have the ring now.

The loot in this zone makes it worth coming back to again and again.
Since they fixed the pathing on the firegiants, those are doable for our 
group :)  Nice twink bp off the named giant too.  His dps spikes kinda 
harsh, recorded 220dps for the 31 seconds my war survived.  Monk died at 
6% health and my cleric had to step in and tank.

My favorite drop was the rare shawl from Xaon Bulzekel, Dark Shroud of 
Oppression, 15dr 15mr and 15pr :)
