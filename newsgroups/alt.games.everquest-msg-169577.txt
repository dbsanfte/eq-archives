First, it wouldn't have made a bit of difference had Mark Twain taken
that creative writing class (though it might well have provoked a short
essay or two on what he found absurd about the teacher and/or textbook).
Second, there's a world of difference between doing something casually
and doing something as your life's work.  Should you make writing your
life's work, and do a good job of it, I will be glad to consider your
work apart from the casual scribblings of the rest of us.  Third, what
works for an artistic genius (and creative writing <is> and art) cannot
be presumed to be a valid approach for others.  It is well worth the
effort required to decipher Twain's method of expressing accents,
<because doing so helps me to enjoy his art>, the reward for struggling
through some EQ players clumsy affectation is not comparable.  Finally,
as I noted in my previous post, this is direct real-time communication,
not unpaced leisure reading on a lazy afternoon.

No, I don't.  I prefer to be able to understand what my groupmates
are telling me when the game is placing us under pressure, and I
want them to understand my words at a glance as well.  Does your
roleplay give me anything comparable to the enjoyment of reading
Twain's prose?

I remain unconvinced that affecting a speech impediment is creative.
As was pointed out in the post you replied to, it is possible to convey
the "flavor" of an accent without raising a barrier to understanding.
Personally, I find inaccessable art to not be art at all.  If you go to
a lot of trouble to be hard to understand you are inviting ridicule.
Just as the 1337 speakers do, and for exactly the same reasons.

I don't care whether you <think> you're being offensive, if you act
rudely or offensively you <are> being offensive.  I don't care if you
<think> you are being discourteous, if you're discourteous you are
discourteous.  [And if some people find me rude and offensive here
in the NG, well, I guess I can live with that.]

If you join my group and are more interested in being unintelligible
than in working together to accomplish whatever our common goals are,
then you're being an ass no matter how "creative" you think your
schtick is.  And if you're enough fun to be with you can roleplay a
mute with Tourette's syndrome and it won't stop me from looking you
up to group with in the future.

Oh, and I notice that you ignored the last line of my previous post,
which restricted the scope of my criticism considerably.  I suppose
it would've dampened your flame too much had you acknowledged it.
