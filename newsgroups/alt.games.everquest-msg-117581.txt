*Every* class can solo to 60 although most wouldn't want to.
My 56 cleric can solo for XP, for instance.   And, if someone
wants to solo, a ranger is probably one of the better choices
outside the "solo" classes.    They can pick and find targets,
have decent damage potential, ability to heal, they have SoW
so they can run from trouble, etc.

I know one ranger that has solo'd all the way to 54 and there's
probably more out there.
