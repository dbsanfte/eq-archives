    Our server was shut down by the new eyecandy - or, rather, by the lack
of people online. Everyone was having problems getting in, the Emperor raid
the other big guild had planned fell through, so we gave in and made it a
shard day.

    Heh, if we mention on the message board that we're doing Cursed cycle we
get a HUGE turnout. Our Emperor run was 80 people - our last Cursed run was
83. Bring your beach towels and tanning lotion, there's a lot of sunshine in
the basement today!

    Gah! Our server has had Ssra crash a fair number of times, but lucky for
us only during off-hours when nobody was there. That was fun, too - lots of
nice repops!

    Anything pushed into a wall can warp to zone. Anyone ressed near a wall
can fall through it and down to levels below. The walls in that room are as
buggy as can be.

    It's good that Blood can be tanked without a /disc - means you don't get
bumped to the back of the MT rotation for jumping in.

    That's pretty good. For our successful attempt, first MT stayed in until
50%. I'm convinced with good healing one person could go all the way.

    Congrats!!! Time to update that .sig! ;-)

    So how did you handle who got Rifts?
