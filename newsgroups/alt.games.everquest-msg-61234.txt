I'm a recent newbie to the entire game of Everquest.  I found though over
the past few weeks that I've before addict to playing this game.  After
dealing with a handful of the various types of characters and races, I've
found harmony with my half-elf ranger (LVL14).
My question for all the Lords and Ladies who have playing this for quite
sometime or may just have more information is.  Where can I take my Ranger
to LVL faster.  I'm currently in Queynos and the surrounding area, but I
think it's time for my character and his Cleric wife to move on the EXP was
good while it lasted, but now it's pretty much non-existent now.  I'd like a
area in a close vicinity of Ranger guild.  Thanks for any help in advance.
