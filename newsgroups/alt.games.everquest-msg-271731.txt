   I think all the complaints, all both of them, are lame.  The FAQ
postings are clearly marked.  They are easily skipped over, if one has no
interest in them.  The community of AGE as a whole requested them.  If a
particular person doesn't like them then fine.  They can just ignore them. 
Easily done.

    So many things make it clear they haven't read it.  They surely can't
think that the tutorial teaches about the evils of autosplit looting, 
grouping tactics, newsgroup etiquette, a hoard of relevant EQ links and so
on.  I do think that is was kinda classy of Zelgadis to come on and
apologize for their posting.  Every community has at least one like this,
and AGE has seen more than its fair share.

    You're welcome.  I'm grateful you took it over since I stopped
playing.  And I realize that you are doing so under more difficult
circumstances than I faced when I had the job.  I think it's simply
ridiculous that you are getting more static than thanks.
