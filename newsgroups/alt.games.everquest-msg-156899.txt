I think that that is something of a bug, but that they probably ignore it at
this point.  60 has always been a half level.  I think they intended for
people to only get a half level towards 61 before the expansion but someone
goofed.  As a result, those already into 60 only needed to make a fraction
of a level to get to 61.  I imagine it will not be so easy for those 59 and
under.  IOW they will fix the half-level effect for those not there yet but
not for those past it.
