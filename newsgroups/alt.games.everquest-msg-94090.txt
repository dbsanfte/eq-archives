I kind of like the Troll guards shouting something like "I will tear
you limb from limb!  Those that mess with the Bashers, they always get
bashed good!"

Also the Dark Elf guards say something like, "The Indigo Brotherhood
is deserving of a far more worthy opponent!"

I also like how the Iksar guards whoop it up, several of them
talking--

Trooper Mozo says, "Fear the blades of the Iksar!" 
Trooper Taer says, "Another victory for the Legion of Cabilis!"
Crusader Bodii hisses, "To victory!"
Trooper Mozo hisses, "To victory!"

and sometimes it looks like they're even sort of huddling together
like they're giving each other high-fives or something.
