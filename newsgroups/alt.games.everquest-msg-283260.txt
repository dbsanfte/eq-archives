"* The use of a DnL Game Credit to gain access to an object or to equip 
your avatar with it makes the object / equipment available to every 
character linked to the Freedom Card (without subscription) including 
trading the item with other players.
The use of this object / equipment is possible until its destruction or 
repair. 
Repairing an item removes the possibility of it being equitable by a 
Freedom player (without subscription). One Game Credit will be necessary 
to reequip the item.
** Companion equipment can be worn by a character with a level of 30 or 
more in FXP.
*** Freedom players (without subscription) wonï¿½t gain more SXP (Social 
XP) over level 20 and thus they cannot progress anymore on the SXP axis."


So, just from this it appears that there is some wear to items, and when
they need to be repaired the player incurs a 1 credit charge to reequip.

Also, it appears that you don't have to worry about this until level 30.

Finally, both options (DnL key+1month or DnL key + 15 creds) cost $54.99.
