OK, look at this logically.  How can Tunare go from being there to not 
being there?  She could be killed by players, if you get 40 of them there, 
which as Martin explains is kind of hard to sneak in under another full 
raid force.  She could despawn due to a bug, but Tunare's habits are 
pretty well known now, and a random, previously unknown despawn bug seems 
pretty unlikely.  She could have been /killed by the GM.  I'm thinking 
Occam's Razor applies here.
