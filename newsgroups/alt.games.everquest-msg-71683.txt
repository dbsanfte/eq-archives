Competition is a wonderful thing, isn't it?  EQ beats DAoC on content.
DAoC beats EQ on the gaming system, customer support, graphics, and
stability.  Mythic can add content easier than Verant can do the
others, so Verant knows that while DAoC might not be a real threat to
them *now*, it is something they have to worry about.  I think this
means they are going to be a lot less hard-assed about those parts of
the Vision that mostly seem to just annoy players, like binding.
