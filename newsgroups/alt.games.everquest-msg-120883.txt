Hello!

We've heard about how character class X of race Y can only effectively solo
up to about level Z.

We've also heard about how connection speed of one's ISP determines how far
one can effectively level as a Bard....

I got into a discussion lately with someone who said that, because of my
crappy ISP connection, that I should abandon my cleric at the higher levels,
and switch to a more melee-oriented class (basically because my cleric won't
be able to keep my party members alive in raid-type situations.)

(I know:  someone's going to tell me to get DSL or cable.  Not in the budget
& won't be for some time).  Currently, due to poor phone lines in my area,
I'm only getting a connection of 26.4 at best.

If I were inclined to change my casual gaming ways, and focus more on
leveling, then the Question would be:
What class(es) would be most effective at leveling on a crappy connection
speed, who won't be crippled or be putting the party in serious danger later
on?

That, and aside from Bard, what other classes should one in my situation
absolutely avoid?

Thanks
--Halfpole.
