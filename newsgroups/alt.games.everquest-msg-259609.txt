*Deep, deep sigh*

    Yep, you're right, and I'll be fixing all the errors mentioned in this
thread.  But the above was going to be changed anyways, since I'm planning
on updating the FAQ when OOW goes live.  Any idea when that might be, btw? 
Or did it happen already and I just missed it?

   Also, about the corpse dragging thing, yeah, I do have to change that as
well.  So I need some feedback, since I can't actually test this myself. 
How does one drag multiple corpses with the new commands? Remember, the
first fairly lucid answer I get is likely to pasted into the FAQ verbatim.
