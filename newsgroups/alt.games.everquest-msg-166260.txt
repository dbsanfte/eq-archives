I quite like emoticons, myself... they are a good way to add richness 
and expressiveness to plain ASCII text. Of course, a very good writer 
ought to be able to convey things like "I'm not serious about this, it's 
meant as irony" and get more than perhaps fifty percent of people to 
realize that he's being ironic, but for the rest of us, a :-) can be 
awfully handy.

I am, for one, hoping for the day when emoticons break out of the 
Internet and into mainstream media. Hell, they are the best extension to 
the writer's toolset since italics.
