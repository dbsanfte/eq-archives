No, while it may be *a* common practice, it is not an unwritten rule.
Let me make this simple: one person looking to pay for a port - many
people wanting to port them. Now you tell me how it can be held
against the customer for going elsewhere if they don't like your
terms.

Besides, you're port-whoring. Don't expect oodles of respect in doing
so.

What mitigates the risk of a druid taking your money and gating? Or
dropping you someplace other than your requested destination? Why do
you think the porter's risk should be eliminated, while the customer's
is not? That's just silly.
