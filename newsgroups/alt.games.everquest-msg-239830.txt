That's you. Many, many workplaces that have internet access restrict
use of their bandwidth. Using company resources for leisure tends to
be a sure-fire way of getting fired if you're not given permission. If
Usenet access is blocked through normal means, then I'd say that's a
clear-cut hint that they're not giving you permission and, thus, using
gateways to get around that block is wrong.
