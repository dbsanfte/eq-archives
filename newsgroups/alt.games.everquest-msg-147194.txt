We ended up have the four manaburn wizards there.  There were a total of
some 45 or so people there to help, guildmembers, allied guilds, friends.
The human Ragefire went down to melee only very quickly, couldn't even see
him buried somewhere in the crowd.  The Dragon Ragefire went down having the
time to cast one AoE.  The AoE caught a few people, and my pet, I resisted
it.  I even managed to land two of my anemic nukes, as the MB wizards did
not cause enough damage to kill the dragon outright.  A bunch of us then
ported and ran out to the island in TD, and celebrated.  The cleric in
question has been at the point of needing just Ragefire for 10 months now,
so, needless to say she is one extremely happy cleric.

Thank you all for the advice offered, thank you Monual for your advice, and
your wonderful stories.
