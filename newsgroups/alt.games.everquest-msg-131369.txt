Personally, I find it rude, albeit very mildly so.  Generally, if I'm not
busy, I'll go ahead and cast a spell, if I'm busy, or they are begging for
something more than a SoW, I will just ignore them completely.  If they find
it rude that I don't respond, so be it.  A couple days ago, someone asked me
for a sow, I was playing my ranger at the time, in full Ivy.  I just said
"No".  I think he was taken quite aback, I did then explain that I couldn't
for quite a few levels yet.  Not really on topic here, as he asked in say,
not a direct tell to me.  Of course, he did hail me first, so it was fair to
assume that he was asking me, but I felt that he was being reasonably polite
about it.
