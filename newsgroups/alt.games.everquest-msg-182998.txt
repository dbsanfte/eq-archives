I'm like the only person (other than an RL mage friend who enjoys CoHing me
around kedge at random) who can navigate that zone.

I can swim from the zone in to just about anywhere in 30-45 seconds.  On the
other hand, if I have to guide some clueless moron around, it takes about 5
minutes.  And that's assuming the clueless moron's invis doesn't fade at a
bad time.

I suppose I can see why you'd pull phinny to zone in, but I still say it's
not worth bothering (all 3 phinnys I've done were at ledge)
