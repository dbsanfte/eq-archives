I spent 35 in south karana hunting grizzleknot. Killing centaur chargers,
aviak avocets, and cyclopses for xp while searching.

Took 5 weeks of 4-8 hours every day. Never found grizzleknot. Stopped
playing EQ for 3 months because of the burnout. So no, I would not
especially recommend that.

Do the bedroom in Lguk, xp churns quick in there.
