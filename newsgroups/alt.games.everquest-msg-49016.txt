 I've gated dozens and dozens of groups up, and participated in
mayby 20 Hate raids personally. Never had a "roamer come around 
the corner" and agro anyone ever. We usually stand real close to 
the zone-in spot until all are gated in and then start pulling. 
Then again, a lot of the times I'm gating in and out bringing
people down and might miss some of that if it happens.   8^/
