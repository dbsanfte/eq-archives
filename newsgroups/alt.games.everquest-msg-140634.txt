Um, Jim, where have you been?  You have not needed any of the stones for
quite some time now.  One thing to add, you only needed to keep the highest
ring key, not all the earlier ones.  Once you got your CS key, you didn't
need any of the others.  Not sure about where all the spells are sold, don't
have a druid high enough to worry about it.
