I get them all the time, but yesterday I had some classics:


I was smithing in Erudin when I get a tell asking for buffs. This is not a
problem - I ask where he was.

    "At the wharf - hurry the boat is coming soon".

/ignore, I don't think you need a high level of buffing to sit on a boat.


Then I go over to Qeynos and a warrior friend is going to get some revenge
on Holly Windstalker and I agree to back up heal if needed. It  was needed
and it took all my mana and most my life from cannibalize. Halfway through
the fight I get a tell asking for SoW. I reply:

    "I am in the middle of a fight - and out of mana, will be a moment"

    "So you won't then"

    /ignore.


Is it just the latest juvenile fad? Idiots believing "You deserve
everything" advertising? Or have people always been such putz's?
