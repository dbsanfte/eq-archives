Can you be transferred off this server? Not sure I can handle the always
anon thing

I'm a near level 30 enchanter and I must say, that the always anon feature
of this server is the one thing I'm not sure I can deal with much longer.

It is often near impossible to find a group, especially at higher levels.
This server has such a low population that I am often the only person in
whatever zone I pass thru. This server may be a druid/necro/shaman's dream
but for non-soloers it is becoming a nightmare. The LFG flag is practically
useless on this server as well.

I mean, cazic thule on a weekend: 0 people, highkeep 0 people, paw 0 people,
so on and so on. They really need to remove the anon feature of this server
because it is simply too unpopulated.
