No, because I think people tend to look at this for the wrong perspective.

Think about how sales and cash value on items and platinum might affect the
way people who would sell these things play the game.  My group and I are at
a camp where a couple items drop that could net us a huge amount of
platinum, or a nice upgrade of items that we already have;  what we don't
consider is that if we were to make a RL cash/Ingame value comparison, the
stuff we're camping could be worth a couple hundred bucks.  But the guys who
*do* consider that know that, and they're not thrilled with us moving in on
their RL lucrative camp, so they train us out, repeatedly, mercilessly.
They hang out at our camp, try to lag us when the named comes so we'll go
linkdead and they can get the loot, they do anything they possibly can to
force us out of there and acquire the loot that we were interested in,
because while it may be a couple upgrades for the four of us, it's that
guy's car payment, or house payment, or student loan payment, or another
night with a prostitute, or whatever.  Real life money's a great motivator
to do all sorts of antisocial things, and that's what's motivating those
guys.

And it doesn't have to be an extreme situation like that, it can just be the
nasty training KSer who's making life miserable for the newbies who are
simply in a zone where a valuable tradeskill item drops.  Platinum and drops
worth platinum motivates those people to do nasty things to others, and that
makes the overall fun of the game worse for everyone who comes in contact
with them.

Plus, if the prices in the bazaar are affected by platinum purchasers, that
can make my earning enough platinum to buy a nice item a real pain in the
ass.  The guy who spends a hundred bucks on platinum and goes out and buys
some high end item can end up driving the price on the item throughout the
bazaar, and he doesn't give a shit if he overpays, because unlike me, he
didn't have to earn platinum over the course of several months to afford the
item in question.

Never discount how much of a corrupting influence real life money can have
on someone's behavior.
