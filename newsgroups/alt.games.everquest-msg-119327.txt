No, because there aren't any.  The guide you talked to knew less about monks
than you, the bard.

What you ran into is classic bard/monk interaction.  I've killed and been
killed by more bards than any other class, and they're not all that
plentiful.  Essentially, your song is breaking the feign.  Try the exact
same scenario, except turn off your songs for long enough for the icons to
wear off, then have the monk feign.  The mob will turn on you.

I hate it, but usually if I'm pulling I try to make sure I'm not in a group
with a bard.  The real fun thing is when I'm pulling for one raid and run
through the aoe range of a bard playing that new aoe mana song without
realizing it.  I feign expecting the mobs to stand around and one-by-one
start to walk back to their spawn points, and instead they all charge off
after some bard that I probably never even saw.  The new CT zone is good for
that.  :)
