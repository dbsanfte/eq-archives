 Might be a good idea to research or ask around about a new zone you 
want to "explore". You walked into a zone with creatures that are level
50 - 60 and it won't be the last time if you don't take the time to 
find out what you're walking into (alone) first.

 I think you can *play* EQ pretty well, seems you know what you're talking 
about but perhaps you just suck at finding answers.
