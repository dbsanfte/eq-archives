I meant earn as in if you and your giuld mates/ group mates etc. go
and kill that level 51. You win the role. You earned it. what you do
with it. (sell or give to alt) is YOUR business. Not some self
appointed <insert your choice of words>. I don't overly have issues
with the recomended ones. but the required is BS. All haveing level
50+ stuff means is you have a nice AC or HP or Damage that helps you
got to what? level 15 in a week. oh whoop..
