: Interesting assortment of opinions on this topic, I'm surprised. There's
no
: question in my mind about the value of Infusion of Spirit in most
: circumstances, it's one of my most powerful and appreciated buffs, and a
: main staple in my buffing arsenal.
:
: As has been pointed out, the primary difference between IoS and HoS is
that
: IoS stacks with all of the single stat buffs, including STR and DEX. HoS
: does not. The advantage of HoS and Focus lines, of course, is that they're
a
: single slot buff which is much better in a raid environment (particularly
: when you start getting the group versions). Whenever I buff someone with
IoS
: and then put a STR and a DEX on top, I am usually maxing out their DEX and
: STR. My usual practice in an exp group is to buff MT with IoS, STR, DEX,
AGI
: and STA, and then also cast Talisman of Kragg (395 HP that stacks with IoS
: but not HoS). They love it.
:
: I got my IoS on the 2nd EP turn in. Yes, it was worth it :)

Thanks, exactly what I was looking for.  I'll wait till I get some
parchments and do the turn-ins.  Also, as I won;t have Kragg for a few
levels (level 50, now) I won't worry about IoS, yet.
