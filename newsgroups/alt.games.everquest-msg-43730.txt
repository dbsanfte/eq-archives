today's set up. Hotkeys subject to change.

spell gems:
Complete Heal
Greater Healing
Celestial Healing
(buff slot) - swap Armor of Faith and Resolution
(buff slot) - Symbol of Pinzarn (which tons cheaper than Naltron) or
Extinquish Fatique
Gate
Enstill
Retribution - sometimes swapped with Resusitate.

Hotkeys:
Where
/doability 1 (sense heading)
/loc

Nuke
/sit off
/cast 8

fizzles and cast)

Hope this helps. Post your level, and perhaps we can help you set up a
spell load/macros appropriate to you.
