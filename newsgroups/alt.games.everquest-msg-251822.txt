Yes, when I did them, the Kobolds were KOS to me, and were social.  That 
was not the problem for me though, the issue was the horrid drop rate on 
the scalps.  Glad to hear that was improved at least, I would have 
preferred that they leave in the social aggro personally, but, then, 
wouldn't want to frighten away any new users by making things difficult.
