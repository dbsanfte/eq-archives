Far less annoying -- and cheaper, when you figure the cost of sitting around
practicing -- would be to get the first level spell Dance of the Fireflies
and just repeatedly cast and destroy the globe you summon. That is 10 mana to
cast rather than 24 for Whirling Wind and its something that you can do
without accidentally targeting someone... guards REALLY don't like it when
you cast offensive spells on other players, even on a blue server where they
will do no harm. Trust me; I've learned that level. Several times.

Skill checks (and therefore skill ups) are based on the act of casting, not
on the level of the spell cast, so a first level spell is just as good as a
44th level spell; much better, in fact, because first level spells take less
mana and cast faster.

Just my 2cp :-)
