Well, they might have redeeming qualities, being neither an artist
nor a porn afficiando my initial irritation at them kept me from
studying them, and my recent two-boxing has kept them all turned
off, so I wouldn't know.  I just don't like 'em.

I'm married indeed, and since seeing an attractive woman leads me
to start thinking about my wife I expect I'll remain so.

I don't.  I do like a lot of non-pornographic nude art tho, but not
much of the abstract stuff.

Any non-quadraplegic who claims that is gonna be difficult to
believe.  Or so it seems to me.

Nah, my rants and arguments here show rather clearly that I'm not
extraordinarily mature.  But, I've never cared for porn and I've
understood just how stupid promiscuity is since I was a young
teenager and learned about all the wonderful and incurable diseases
out there that depend on promiscuity (this was before AIDS/HIV).

OTOH, I don't make the mistake of presuming that I understand the
minds and emotions of over 6 billion strangers.  I find my own
relatives and friends somewhat unpredictable, it would be pretty
foolish of me to assert that I understand your inner thoughts and
feelings, don't you think?
