I think what happened there is that both your boots & cords have the
same percentage haste (30%) - the I & II only affect the level of the
spell, and in the case of SoW, it's low enough that both items could
apply.  So the game considers them equivalent, and could use either
(probably choosing the one that comes first in your inventory, however
the game sorts that).

I think the Lockjaw Vest will stack with those effects, adding 15%
duration to your SoW (or any spell up to & including level 20).
