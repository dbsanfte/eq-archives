    When I first started a Paladin 5 months ago; I remeber reading all the
posts debating the usefullness of Paladins at higher levels.  At that time
getting to level 40 seemed like an unreachable goal, so I did not pay much
attention to those debates.
     I  am now a month or two from level 50 and I am starting to worry.
[NO starting a different class character is not an option.] [No I do not
want to re-open the debate]

What I really need and want is advice on how to best play the Paladin I have
created.

     My major problem is getting my role right.    I can help with heals
after the battle.  I can taunt and cast stuns to try and get the mob to
focus on me.  I can pull and let the mob take out its fury on me.  I can
interupt the caster some of the time with bash/stun.

        I guess what concerns me is that at this level it seems like the
damage I am doing doesn't really seem to make much of a difference compared
to the 'nukers' and the 'dot'ers.  My heals and buffs seem to add very
little to what the cleric provides.   My 2hs weapon  out damages my 1hs
shield combo by 30%. Yet when I switch it seems to make little or no
difference on how fast our group kills a mob.

       I am uncertain about when I should root, so I usually do not.  If
there is a double pull, is it my job to simply assist and try to take down
the one mob; what should I do if the mezzed or rooted second mob breaks free
an attacks a caster ... stay and try and kill the 1st one or break off an
try and protect the caster.  If I do the later what happens to the first
mob.

     I guess I am asking those 50+ Paladins what they did to continue to
advance, what skills or techniques did they use.  What should I be focusing
on now.
