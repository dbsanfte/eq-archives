Antonious Bayle seems to have a fairly stable population of around 250-300
people in the bazaar at any time. Given a number of them are hunting C3
and active auctioning, going to the quiet periods the number drops to
about 150-170 - my guess is that that is a fairly reasonable guess at the
AB perma-mule population, with I'd guess about 50 temporary sellers on at
any time, now how many of those temporary ones are simply the player
activating his mule when not adventuring or dialup mules or similar I cant
guess how big the pool to make those 50 people comes from...
