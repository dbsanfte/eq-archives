That is exactly what I did, and I got a GENERIC response from them that
I kinda posted above -- the IP addresses above are where the zone
servers are located, I am supposed to figure out how to put them into
my firewall, and also all access to almost every port out there so my
computers will be open to attacks from everyone (I have software that
can help fortunately but that slows the system). What worries me is
that this port problem could move over to my MAIN, and then I would be
upset. I have spent the last 3 days (he has been locked out since
Saturday night), going through web sites that explain how to fix this
etc, but none involve the hardware I am using.
