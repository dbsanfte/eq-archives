Sorta.
All the named and many of the "guards" are KOS to all, however, there
are other mobs in that zone which are on CoV faction.

If you're gonna use the monk flop plop method, having the monk be
non-KOS to CoV will help as the only mobs of concern are those named
and guards.

They give faction hits, both to Guardian of Veeshand and Claw of
Veeshan.
