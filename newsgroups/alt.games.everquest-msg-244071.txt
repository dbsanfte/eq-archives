You can find me on the site as Chamzel.  I haven't posted much for
reasons being...  

A. Don't have FTP that lets me link to other sites (Curse Geocities!)

B. Don't really have much new work to show off.

C. Don't comment on other's work... ever, unless asked to.

D. Don't show my work off, because I usually feel confident enough in
my abilities, even though I know I have lots of space to improve in
when comparing my pictures to others.

Nikaila posted a picture of mine up there and when it got a few
comments on it I registered and started posting to straighten out some
(common) misconceptions about it being like DBZ.  The work that I have
been putting out lately has been in relation with the story I'm writing
up at 'www.geocities.com/chamzel' (http://www.geocities.com/chamzel) . 
I try to advertise it at least once everywhere I go so I can get more
people to read it and stuff.  XD

I'm also guilded with Sashia, if you've ever seen or heard of her on
the Studios forum.
