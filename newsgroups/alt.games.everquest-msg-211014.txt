Nope, at low levels he's a lot like a SK pet, wimpy but nice for added damage
production.  At higher levels, he's more like having a monk following you
around, serious DPS that can tank slowed mobs for a while if you really need him
to.

If you aren't taking too much damage, feel free to cannibalize while the mob
beats on you, lots more interesting than cannibalizing during the down time.
Get used to channeling spells thru a beating, its something you should be very
good at by the time you get up in levels.

This is an excellent point, not only are you a better sponge than your pet (so
it makes more sense to have mob doing damage to you, saving healing mana) but by
going in and tanking you can position your pet behind the mob, which amounts to
about a 15% boost in his damage output as the mob won't get to parry, dodge, or
riposte any of his hits.  Plus you get to add in your own DPS, which in your 30s
should still be pretty decent.  Assuming the mob does the same amount of damage
either to you or your pet, you'll spend the same amount of mana on heals, but by
tanking yourself will almost double the damage per second you do... as you level
up your own DPS will get crappier and crappier and your pet's will get higher
and higher, but still that 15% "bonus haste" on your pet is a good reason to
keep taking the hits for him, not to mention that the assumption that your pet
and you will take the same amount of damage is false, you'll take lots less than
he will.  Even better, get a real tank in as a partner, so you can heal someone
who's taking even less damage than you would.
