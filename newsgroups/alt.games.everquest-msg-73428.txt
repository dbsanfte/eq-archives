You got me there heheheh

 I am one of those people that reformats his system every month or so
just to be sure it's running at it's peak. With practice you can
completely rebuild a system in 25-30mins. With Ghost (or any other
imaging software) you can do it in 5-7mins :-).

I agree 100% with this. 

Only the person faced with doing the work can judge whether or not it
is worth it. Reformatting can be extremely frustrating when things go
wrong.

Cheers
