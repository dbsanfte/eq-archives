As I remember... and I am old... so my memory is faulty, but isn't this 
also a part of the complexity?

Speaking of "greens".. isn't the total EXP that the Mob has, divided in 
half for every member of the group that cons it green or light blue?

Example:  MOB=1000 EXP (I am also leaving out the group bonus)
Group  :  4 players. 2 con it dark blue and 2 con it green.

Math   :  (1000 / 2)/2 or 250 Because 2 players con it green.

So before adding the levels and splitting the EXP, we have already 
quartered the EXP.  Then we take the lvl 20, 20, 30, 30 (pick for ease) 
and they will get 20%, 20%, 30%, 30%, or 50, 50, 75, 75. But remember it 
was green to the higher levels... so they get NO exp.  And we have a 1000 
point mob giving out 100 points to this group.

If I have this wrong or it was changed, I need to know as well.
