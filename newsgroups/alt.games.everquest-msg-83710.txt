Wasn't meant to be boasting, sorry if it came off that way.  I was trying 
to convey the idea that EQ is much less important than most of the other 
things that I allow people to have access to.

Sorry again.  I was referring to his specific comments about computer 
security.  If you would like we can debate this, but I'm sure the rest of 
the ng would be more bored than they are now.  I think that when I am 
talking about computer security a bit of background is useful.

Biz, you're a dick, and I mean that in a good way, but chill the fuck 
out, please.  We all know that 99% of the people who claim to be hacked 
gave out their password.  That's doesn't mean that everyone who gives out 
their password will be hacked.  I know literally dozens of people in the 
game who share their accounts with guildmembers, and I know of no 
incidents because of it.  
Have you ever had a roommate?  A lover?  A spouse?  Did you share the 
keys to your car/home/apartment with them?  How do you know that they 
didn't go out and duplicate the key, and post it along with your address 
and license plate number on every telephone pole in town?  Trust most 
likely.  How did you decide to trust those people?  Do you ever have your 
jeep worked on?  Do you leave the keys with the shop?  How do you know 
that they won't duplicate the keys and steal it the next night?  Are you 
sure they're bonded?  Is your jeep/home/job more important to you than 
your EQ account?  Unless the answer is no, sharing access to any of that 
ever makes you a hypocrite or a liar.

Oh jesus, now we're to believe that not only are you CIA, but that you're 
carrying a cyanide capsule in a false tooth.  I did my time in the 
military, I had the security clearance, I was in the nasty areas, I saw 
more 'action' than 95% of the peacetime military, and I still was in MUCH 
more danger fighting forest fires.
Of course several of my guild members are in military, including special 
forces and presidential guard.  The special forces guy who died two weeks 
ago?  He replaced one of our rangers who rotated out.  They had been 
stationed together off and on for 10 years.  That ranger has my account.  
I trust him.

Well, generally, that's not a bad idea.  I guess if a woman were to ever 
betray your trust, the best solution is to beat the living shit out of 
her.  

I have shared my account info with several people whom I trust.  I will 
continue to do so.  I expect that almost everyone in a high-end raiding 
guild will do so also.  Saying that we're idiots for doing so is 
shortsighted and asinine.  I take full responsibility for sharing the 
account, and if there were a problem, I would have some very specific 
info which would help track down WHO did it.  To me that is proper 
precaution.
