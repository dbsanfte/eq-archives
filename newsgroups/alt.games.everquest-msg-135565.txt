Hell, I can't even remember that Dwarves don't have gills!  My first death
last came from killing fishes in Blackburrow. I was having so much fun
chasing the wee little bastards down that I never checked my air meter. When
I realized the thing doing 284 damage a pop to me was ME I tried to swim
straight up...inertia carried my corpse through the surface. I was so
disgusted with myself I looted everything as opposed to go looking for a
ress. Another reason why I'm concerned about getting This XP back. Ah well.
If I log in and there's still time I'll ask. It is just a game, but I am
still a customer. There shouldn't be any harm in asking
