Well, between WoW and EQ2 and EQ1 subscription costs, I was gonna get 
the rolling pin from the wife, so I had to choose. I decided to go with 
the All Access plan with SoE so I could play both EQ2 and EQ1 for 
$22/mo.

Trouble is, I'm wanting to get back to EQ1, but my main wasn't doing it 
for me anymore, and that character is on Firiona Vie. Therefore, no alts 
possible there.

No problem, I thought. I'll just fall back on my secondary server where 
all my original "mains" are. Well, I've popped into Saryrn a few times 
now and the place is a ghost town. I don't see much happening for me 
there, sadly.

That leaves the option of rolling something up on one of the newer 
servers, maybe, in hopes of more variety in the level of the majority of 
the players. The servers I'm considering are:

Stromm
Morden Rasp
Maelin Starpyre
Tholuxe Paells

Those are just some of the newer servers I could think of. I don't know 
much about them beyond that. Could anyone here recommend one over the 
others or maybe even some other server for a seasoned player to start 
over on?

Also, what can anyone tell me about those I've listed?

Tia.
