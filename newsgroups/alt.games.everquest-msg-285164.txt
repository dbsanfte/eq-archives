In a recent thread, I was schooled on the concept of the MT being 
someone different from the MA.  While I've rarely seen this done, I can 
see the reasoning behind it.

But what I'm wondering is, whats the ideal class for MA?

We're looking for someone who doesn't switch targets, so not an 
enchanter, nor bard, nor any debuffing class, nor any buffing or healing 
class, nor any offtanking class, nor any pulling class.

That leaves rangers and rogues.

We also need someone who doesn't die often, which lets out rangers and 
rogues.

What am I missing?
