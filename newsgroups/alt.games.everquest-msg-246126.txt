What other approach should a warrior take? :) I don't play a warrior, but my
RL best friend plays my cleric's brother on FV, so I of course have a
certain affinity for the warrior class. I agree that at high levels, the new
regen rate really isn't all that much (or else I'd be out of a job!) for
warriors, but...on the other hand, every little bit does help, and it
doesn't require changing out better gear for worse just because of a small
amount of hp regen on another item.

Just my 2 cp to toss into the mix, for what it's worth (probably less than
2cp lol). :)
