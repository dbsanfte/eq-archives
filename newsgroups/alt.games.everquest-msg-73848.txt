I can't see the map since EQMaps isn't responding right now.  However,
I'll assume it's the infamous "Safe Hall" in VP.

Two things you have to remember about the safe hall:

1.  Stay the hell away from the north side of the wall.  The pathing
of the two roamers takes them close enough to the north side that any
KOS person sitting there will potentially aggro.

2.  No dueling.  The roamers act just like guards when you duel.
We've even thought about using that as a way to pull some of the
dragons.  :)

>fighting anywhere other than way back in the corner is a bad idea; 

Generally fighting any of the wurms is a bad idea without the two
roamer dragons dead.  Their aggro range is HUGE and when you engage a
wurm and they happen to come close to the hall, they will join in.
Remember, Hoshkar's lair is just a bit out of that hall and to the
left.

It's a good spot to pull the two roamer dragons, but as I said, it's
very dangerous to try and kill wurms with those two dragons up.

Hoshkar, I actually recommend engaging inside his lair (there will
almost always be additional wurms that come with this).  The reason
for this is that both SW and Hosh will gate.  Hosh will be EXTREMELY
difficult to kill when it starts gating unless you have a bunch of
wizards who managed to survive long enough to drop the big nukes in a
timely fashion.

Silverwing's AoE is gimpy so most folks survive to kill it before it
gates.  Hoshkar's AoE is DiseaseCloud which is a 1250 dd nuke + 70%
turgur.  That usually means casters die real fast since that AoE has a
habit of punching through even 290+ DR.  And of course with all the
meleers slowed, it makes it very hard for them to hold aggro.

In the hall you were, fairly uncommon.  A bit further in (especially
near the pool room and zone out areas), a bit more common.

West wing as in the three named in there or just the non-named?
Because if you can do Lendiniara, you're pretty close to attempting
Aaryonar (no, I'm not implying that they are similar in any shape or
form--they are two completely different types of battle).

When you get to the "pool room" (trust me, can't miss it), hit
tracking, even as a druid I can pick him up on tracking.  He is the
only non-white/red con on radar.  We've speculated that he loads the
key to the locked room leading to Phara Dar's room.
