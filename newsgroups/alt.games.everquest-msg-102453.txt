Definately the 33.6 hardware. Your going to be pushing that machine to it's
limits running EQ and a software modem is going to be falling over. Besides,
a nice hardware 33.6 k modem is the ideal gaming modem unless you live in an
area blessed with pristine phone lines.

Before I got cable I used to run quite a few different brands of 56k V90
(serial ext) modems and when I was gaming on the net I used to peg them back
to 33.6k for stability. The games are designed to be able to run on a 28.8k
connection so you should not run into throughput problems - may need to ask
a raid person for confirmation on that though.

The faster a modem goes the more susceptible it is to line noise, and the
more likely it is to be retraining constantly to keep an optimum speed - and
when it's retraining your not sending or recieving game data. Best to have
it running at a speed the line can easily handle- and not have to budge off
it for any reason.

Then again, some people have a shoddy phone line, sometimes even 33.6k is
too fast. I have seen modem logs of people who cannot get connections over
16k and even then they had 50% packet loss. When it rained - they literally
could not get a connection at all.... If you are one of those poor blighters
then consider upgrading to carrier pidgeons : )
