I've hit 61 with my Wizard.  Now, it is decision time.  Many spells the last
few levels have been too expensive for me.  I'm also behind average on
equipment, being a non-twinked soloer, so my mana pool seems a bit lower
than others of my level (e.g., I see 55 or so Wizards quad flies in PoD.  I
just have enough if I don't get any resists on snare or nukes).

My guild is pretty dead...the active players left for the raiding guilds,
leaving mostly twinks, or alts just left in the guild for chating.

So, I'm thinking maybe retiring my Wizard for a few months, and then
checking to see if the prices have come down in the Bazaar on the spells I'm
missing and on int and mana gear.  Anyone tried this?

I haven't decided how to pass the time while I wait.  Here are some
possibilities.  I'm curious what people here would do.

1. Play an alt on the same server.  Advantage of this is I can use the alt
to check out guilds to find a new home for the Wizard for when I resume him.

2. Start a character on some other server.  Many possibilities there:

    A. Some people from work play on Fennin Ro.  Playing where you know
    people is always nice.

    B. Become one of the a.g.e crowd on FV.

    C. Play on test so I can start at 25.

3. Try DAoC again.  Someone else from work is playing there, so that could
be fun.  My previous DAoC run was soured by playing with a friend who did
some things that basically ruined the fun for me, but I think that's far
enough in the past now that I can play without being too reminded of that.

4. Give up MMORPGs for a while.  Finish MoH, do the NWN expansion, finish
Zelda on my Gamecube, take up Go again.
