That is the Freeport one?  The Geynos one was just as hard, although I
didn't die it took me four attempts to get it done...I was soooo nervous =)

Funny thing was, I crafted my own III runes to get my sneak etc up and from
there it was great.
Like with most others, the frustration of the first few attempts drove me to
killing everyone else in the lair.
