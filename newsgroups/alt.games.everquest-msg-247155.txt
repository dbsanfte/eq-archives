Well seeing as you think most I what I post is wasted bandwidth I'll 
keep this extra short. :)

1) I didn't complain about it.
2) I stated why I didn't complain about it earlier in the thread.
3) I never said *you* created any CoH threads.
4) CoH is still OT and belongs elsewhere, and I have no problem saying 
that if someone asks if CoH belongs here.
5) If people continue to post CoH threads, I will continue not complaining.

I trust we can all live with that.
