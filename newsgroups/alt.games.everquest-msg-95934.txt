I know this part of epic is same as Druid. Try www.eqdruids.com and look at
epic quest.  also try rangers glade ( sorry not sure of the url)
He will spawn 24 hours after VS is killed. step in and pull up tracking to
see if he is up. also be aware that alot of folks are looking to for them
also.  anyhow, take a look at eqdruids and that nswhould help out.
