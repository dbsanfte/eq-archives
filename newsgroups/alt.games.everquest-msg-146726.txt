I did wonder if maybe there was still a problem/nerf...It did seem this 
weekend that I was getting little exp from Killing Blues (but low blues) at 
52..this was in a group.
I just figured I must be imagining it because of the original 
change...maybe I wasn't.

If levels bothered me it would likely bother me but they don't so I'm not 
too fussed...I guess that now makes death penalties even worse tho'
