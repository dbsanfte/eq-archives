 Hehe.. took me like a year to get my best friend interested. He always
called EQ "EverQueer" and thought it was a stupid game until I finally
took it over there and installed it, walked him though character creation
and helped him ding a few times, then I went home.
 
 Next day he calls me and tells me he had dinged 10 and was asking all
sorts of questions and begging items off me! Hahaha... since then he's
been a TOTAL EQ-aholic and frequently cusses me out for getting him 
started hehe... but I know he's having a heck of a good time playing.
