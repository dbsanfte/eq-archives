Was watching the Today Show today (no way?  LOL) and I caught a blurb about a
guy selling his ex wife's wedding dress on Ebay so I looked up the auction...

I'm still waiting for the Today Show to run the whole story, but just reading
this is hilarious...

Anyway, sorry for the OT, but wanted to share this with you guys.  :)
