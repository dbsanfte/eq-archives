This was Beta...I never payed for Tanarus...
I played as Plas....I had some IRL friends that played and sometimes we
played as 1of5,2of5,3of,4of5,5of5...(They were Isepic, BlueThunder,
FederalKid, and Kilaz)..... And we did this while talking on the phone with
headsets....Made team work run quite smoothly.....

I logged in...probably almost a year ago, and my stats were still there....

I remember getting 2-3 Chams on a team, but using...hmm...batteries or power
intensifiers?(I forget what they were called)....and run around with no
invis on the Cham...surprised many people with that setup....And explaining
to people on your own team you were not invis on purpose.....I think they
nerfed the Cham or something when people started using that tactic......

I played SubSpace beta also, there was no way I was paying monthly for
that.....
