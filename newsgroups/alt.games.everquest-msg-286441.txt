Like all usenet groups, this one gets its share of spam (especially
"gold farmers" spam), but yes, this is still a place to discuss and
ask questions about EverQuest.  As another respondent said, there
are also other forums on the net that have higher traffic these days,
but many of us are still here and happy to talk about EQ.  Did you
have something specific you wanted to bring up?

As another poster mentioned, even though traffic is fairly low on
this group lately, the FAQ is a handy resource in itself.  See my
sig for a link.
