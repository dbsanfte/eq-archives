Went there last night with a full group, we had a blast, of course, only 
one person was under level 60 in the group.  We had to use off tanking and 
rooting for crowd control, didn't much bother with harmony or lull, as at 
our level, they were amazingly trivial to do.  It's kind of fun to visit 
some of the old haunts that used to be a challenge, and just mess around.
