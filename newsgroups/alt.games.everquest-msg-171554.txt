I've played an Enchanter to 17 (two of them actually) which gives a
pretty damned good taste of what they can do.  The player who got me

into EQ a couple months after release played an Enchanter as his

main back when nobody knew what they were good for and nobody played
them because they were too hard.  I was there with him as he figured
out what they were good for (which turned out to be a whole lot more
than the patheticly gimped Paladin of the time).

We're talking about two different group leaders here.  I'm referring
to the all-to-common "stfu and play manasong" morons, while you refer
to a knowledgeable player who has the unfortunate bit of arrogance to
treat every group as a "raid" and demand the same from his mates.
There's quite a huge difference between the two:  the first has his
head jammed so firmly up his ass that he's totally lost if anybody
departs from the sacred rituals he holds dear, while the second is
compelled by her own hyper-competitive nature to pay close attention
to every attempted tactic just in case it turns out to be another
way to get an "edge".  "My" leader is an idiot, while "yours" is an
annoyance usually well worth enduring who is not going to demand
compliance without solid reasons nor refuse to attempt new tactics.

As for your "wasting time is almost criminal" comment:  I have to ask
just how it is that <you> learned the strengths and weaknesses of
<your> class in groups?  Did you always and only do exactly as you were
told?  Did you never do anything save buff and heal?  Are you arguing
with me just for the sake of arguing?

Ah, and here you answer my last question with a mildly qualified yes.
