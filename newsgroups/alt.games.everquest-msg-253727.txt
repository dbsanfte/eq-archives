So if they built an even 'safer', bigger, heavier, gas guzzling monster 
would you stuff your family into that and raise the bar again?

Perhaps they should just ban suvs from cities entirely, and make the 
roads safer for everyone. My car would be a lot safer if idiots in 
monster trucks weren't careening around. (Not saying *you* are one of 
those idiot drivers)

If everyone was driving a car the risk of being hit by an suv would 
disappear, and if the risk of being hit by an suv disappeared, the need 
to drive one to protect yourself from getting hit by one would also 
disappear.

Since, you would be unwilling to lead the way, because it 'puts your 
family at risk', it seems legislation would be the only way to curb the 
escalating problem.
