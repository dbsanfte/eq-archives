Your combats are completed in zero time?

No you can't.  A Warrior/Rogue/Paladin/SK can't solo worth a damn (or
even at all) without good gear, and the quality of the gear required
increases fast with level.  A naked Druid can solo for xp faster than
a melee with great gear (/mourn the prenerf FungiMonkee).  And a Druid
gets more boost from KEI than from gear (Druids with FT14 are uncommon).
On the other hand, a caster grouped with a C2 capable Enchanter gains
little from KEI.  Conversely, a caster with KEI has considerably less
to gain from grouping, and if suitable hunting grounds are available a
Druid or Wizard with KEI probably loses by grouping (under L61 at any
rate).
