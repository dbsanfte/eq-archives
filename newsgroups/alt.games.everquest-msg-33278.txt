Does anyone know if there are any creatures that drop spiderling silks in
this area? I'm trying to get into tailoring and ahve been finding the giant
spiders of WK perfect for obtaining spider silks, but have been unable to
find anything that I can get the spiderling variety off. Maybe it's time to
move to Freeport soon :)

Thanks in advance
