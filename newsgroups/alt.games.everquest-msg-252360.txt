At least up through 50th lvl, soloing a warrior appears to be
extremely efficient. I pulled a 46 warrior out of retirement after the
regen changes and the speed at which he solo'd was impressive compared
to grouping exp. Soloing got me a lvl in about 4 hours in the high
40s, fighting red con mobs in Druga with some higher lvl friends
didn't give me half that. 

Except for a fungi and soulscream belt, my warrior has pretty shitty
equipment. With the way regen works now, if I'd had Temp/Virtue, it
would be almost as effiicient as using a fungi. I'd loose 150hp a
minute regen but I'd take less damage (temp would bump my ac over
1000) and, with an extra 1k hitpoints, you can go longer between 'med
breaks'  and make better use of the sitting regen since the longer you
sit, the faster you regen. 

The main problem with soloing is that you have a very narrow range and
selection of mobs that you can solo efficiently. You need mobs that
are barely dark blue cons, so low level that they're borderline light
blue and you also need a zone where you can pull single, melee mobs.
It's still boring as hell but I can't fault the efficiency. 

Warrior is 51 now, not sure if I can solo him once he hits 52. I know
it's theoretically possible but I can't think of a good zone with
single pullable mobs the right level (39-43).  ...anyone have any
suggestions?

One thing I found surprising is the people saying that warriors die a
lot soloing. Give him a sow potion and he's pretty much indestructable
ime.
