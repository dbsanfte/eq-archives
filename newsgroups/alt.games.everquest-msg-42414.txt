All giants raise claws of veeshan. Frost definately do. 
That is why said faction is so easily raised, in kael anyway. Doing it
on regular frost giants outside is the very hard way.

yep, the VERY VERY hard way. I did the same in about 2 kael raids and
a couple quests ;)

The helms can also be given to the spell casting outfit dwarf to the
left of the dain (Chancellor?) Only in that case it is 4 at a time. I
forget but glower dubious might be okay for that. This is the best way
to raise the dain, 4 helmets give you a  real boost. The faction
increase from helmets are way more than from other dain raising quests
which are basically nil.
