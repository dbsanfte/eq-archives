This is the height of arrogance ... there are a number of players of this
game who do not hail from the US of A, or indeed have English as a first
tongue.   Do not generalise (note correct English not US spelling).  If your
beef is with native English speakers say so. Do not slander other cultures
who are more used to the slang emanating from the US and hence tend to use
plz and the like.
