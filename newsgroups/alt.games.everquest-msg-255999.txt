Y'know, I used to lament that my husband never was willing to take pickup
groups. I *honestly* wanted the roulette of it all, because new and varied
forms of idiots can be a fun thing to deal with if you keep the right
attitude.  Sort of like watching an old kung-fu movie you KNOW is going to
be bad, or of course B-grade sci-fi flicks.

And sometimes you meet pretty decent folks. It is especially fun when
you manage to make friends with the kind of person you wouldn't bother to
get to know IRL.
