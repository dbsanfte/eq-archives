OK I'm starting the Official Dark Tyger Fan Club.
All members reiceive an offical DT T-shirt and get a 15%
discount in all usenet arguements.
Also for a limited time you will recieve your official "Sea Trolls",
just put them in a bowl and add heat and watch them grow.
Hey they almost look human!! WOW!!

YOu will also get the weekly newsletter that will let you know
what or who DT is in a flame with for that week. Never get left out
again!! ( News letter availiable in english or dOOd, please state your
preferance).

And if you act now you will also get the very Limited Gnome chia pet.
Official EQ Chia People!! Come On!! don't miss out on that!!

Also DT will send you an autgrapghed copy of his book,

"The Dark Tyger Book of Proverbs,Maxims, and Famous Phrases"

You will read great DT lines like, "Learn the Internet you Moron",
and "You are the biggest waste of life I have ever seen".
And of course "You really are a sniveling waste of flesh, aren't you."

You to will be able to have quick retort with usenet trolls.

So act now or lose out.

Just respond to this post with " Hell yes!! I'm a Tyger Too !!!

















This is only a parody all spelling mistakes are on porpoise.
