In my never ending quest to find ways to screw up in EQ, I may have
latched on to yet another.  The other day I had gone with a guildmate
and formed a pickup group hunting snow cougars in Iceclad near the Gnome
village. After a while we had a full group and it was suggested that we
move over one island and hunt gnolls at their camp. (This turned out to
be rather a disaster when we pulled some named gnoll who smoked us like
salmon.) But anyway, we did kill a half dozen or so first.
   When talking to another guildmate about it yesterday, he immediately
said, "WTF were you doing killing the gnolls there!!?? You can get
amiable with them, and they have some good quests and stuff. You're just
supposed to be killing the cougars!"
   Hey! I'm the new troll in town, and I've been killing gnolls of
various tribes since my earliest levels! How was I to know??!!  So
anyway, have I really screwed up here? Do I really need good faction
with these gnolls, and will any negative faction hits I took affect me
later on in other parts of Vellious?  My friend mentioned I can fix this
faction by hunting Ulthorks later on. Do I need to worry about this?
