Sigh, as I have already said if it's in the game now at some point it
was looted if a character is in the game now at some point it was
leveled by someone. If they want to sell their already leveled
characters with a bunch of good equipment then great, I don't really
care. But if the company itself starts selling maxed, once again I
will say it so no one will miss it "MAXED", characters and letting
them play with people who worked for their characters and even people
who bought characters who were already leveled and equiped then the
game will break down. I'm not talking moral implications or whatever
the crap you think I am, I'm talking about they are completely maxed
now going around doing things even normal lvl 60's couldn't do because
they have everything. Crap, how could you compete with a wizard who
has the 15 flowing though cap up and al Al'Kabors expansivemind on,
kodiac's expansive intellect item and free friggn nuke robes or items.
They could sit places farming equipment or just plain hogging mobs for
the fun of it for no reason, they'd immediately out nuke and damage
anything in the game and never run out of mana being that they could
pick any equipment in the game and with just the stuff I mentioned you
gain 30+ mana a tick standing up. Twinking is nothing like what this
is, this is just blatent and rampant cheating except it makes the game
company more money so it's ok with them. So once again yes people who
bought the game to play it for what it is would quit the game if they
didn't feel the need to buy their own maxed characters, right there
would most likely cut EQ's players down by half. Now the people who
buy characters are the majority, no one is left to be ahead of or to
acent past nor is there any way to so what's the point of playing with
the character now that there's no one left in the game to be amazed at
your l33t character. Now that cuts down the rest of EQ's players,
there are no more players left so EQ is destroyed. Once again twinking
is not the issue here it's the selling of maxxed characters.
