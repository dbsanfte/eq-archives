I think I'd actually have to disagree with that, at least in part.   While you
are correct that most of the customers wouldn't roleplay even if the option
presented itself, there are several Sony created impediments to roleplaying.

Raid targets are a big one.   For the evil characters, theres not a whole lot
out there to kill, unless you go after your own Gods.  Especially in PoP
progression.   For the good characters, it's impossible to progress beyond
Tier 3 PoP without slaying Lord Mithaniel Marr.  (Or at least it was until
they added the "raid into Elementals / Time, loot an item to permanently
bypass the flag.)

Regardless of which Velious faction your character would have preferred, there
was a clear progression through those raids for guilds.  Dwarf faction >
Dragon faction > Giant faction.   Then after maxing out Giant faction by
farming NToV, Sleeper's Tomb (and keys to the zone), you're finally able to
fight back into Kael and take on the Avatar of War, destroying your Giant
faction again.

GoD and OoW, you're essentially locked into being an enemy of Lord Muram
Mutam, or whatever his name is.  Where are the options to join with the
invaders and oppress the poor elveses?

Even beyond that, I would argue that the general game design in itself
discourages roleplaying.   The game design itself vastly encourages camping
over dungeon crawls.  It's got to be somewhat hard to roleplay that "Oh no!
Shaman Garubish survived our deadly attack again last time (despite us looting
his dead body)... let us smite him for the seventh time!"

Repeatable quests, same deal.   After the 15'th warrior epic, you really have
to start to wonder what those dwarves are doing with all those Hands of the
Maestro...

even." - Joey Comeau on increased realism in gaming.
