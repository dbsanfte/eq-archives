Hmmmm.... good point. And then it could be at least *somewhat* useful
if, for instance, everyone wanted to go to Freeport. (Why, I can't
imagine, but still....)

The huge number of ports and TLs available now, though, have made
transportation so trivial that it's no longer much of an issue. I tend
to go through a stack of portal fragments at the end of a raid and just
sending folks all over. I was thinking more in terms of setup. But there
just aren't that many bindable points where people tend to leave on a
raid from anyway. GFay, sure, but I can already TL anyone there without
the cost of a portal frag.

Nope. The more I think about it, I can't come up with any startlingly
practical use for it if it's limited to melee bind zones. Unless... can
melee bind in Sanctus Seru and such? (I don't spend any time on Luclin
to speak of outside of the bazaar and shadowhaven.) I suppose you could
get a raid *closer* to some luclin destination that way.

On Velious? Ok. Melle can bind in Thurg, so I guess you could save a
couple minutes over having them TL'd to the ring and running a half
mile. Can anyone bind in Skyshrine or Kael? Or just casters? Never tried
with my warrior, so not sure.  If you can, then I guess you could speed
up Tormax, Vindi, AoW etc. as well as some other Velious stuff.

Kunark... Not a lot of folks can walk around in Leeezardtown, and who
the hell goes to FV?

Old World? Paineel doesn't buy you much time over Tox for a Hole raid.
And does anybody ever really "raid" anything in Antonica but the Hole,
and that only for Epic bits, and a couple of groups tops.

An interesting question, no doubt. And there might be some hugely useful
application for it that I'm just not seeing at first glance. But I don't
know what it is right now.
