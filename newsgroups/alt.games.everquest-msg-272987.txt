It wouldn't let me do that...  After trying damn near everything I could 
come up with, the best approach I've found (at least for my play-style) is 
to play the game in windowed mode on my primary monitor (at full size 
though), and use my other monitors for displaying maps and whatnot.  You can 
play fullscreen in a multi-display environment, but it will snap to 
full-screen on one monitor, and whenever you click outside the game, it will 
revert back to windowed mode anyway...
