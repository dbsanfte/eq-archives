I'm an older player too, with the time constraints of a job and two children
active in extracurricular activities.  I play casters for the most part.
And I welcome this change with open arms.

No more will some moron with a KEI who is five levels too young to be where
he/she is be able to come onto the hunting grounds I'm using and wipe it out
solo, then bitch at me for wanting spawns.

Then you should be unaffected, if the level restrictions are the same as
they are for hig-end drui and shammy buffs.  43 is the lowest level you can
be to get these buffs.

If it were only that simple.

You see, the nature of this game makes it to where the way you choose to
play your game affects the way I'm able to play mine.  If I choose not to
get KEI, that doesn't stop the aforementioned moron from ruining my night.

Do you see the difference?
