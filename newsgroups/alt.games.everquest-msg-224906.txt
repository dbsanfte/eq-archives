Heh, nice. I decided to go the other direction and am working my way through
Regen first and then Run. My Black Fur Boots are phenomenal, I can click
them on even when I'm already running and they have no casting time or
interruption potential, just instant level 52 SoW. Of course they only work
outdoors, so that was the tradeoff, and I just try to be conscious of
keeping Shrew on. Still, it'll be nice to have Baron sewed up with both Run
and Regen and then move on to the fun stuff.

And yes, the Regen is noticable and appreciated under the general theory
that every little bit counts (which is why I bother to become a bear once
inside the dungeon).
