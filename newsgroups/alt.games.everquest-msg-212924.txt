I am very new to EQ, but work on advanced telecommunications software
for a living. A message in an above thread mentions that there is a
problem with people on dial up connections. There is no mention as to
whether it affects both software and hardware modem users. I use both a
dial up and T1 connection depending on where I am, and have only noticed
longer zoning times, a few disconnects etc., on the modem, nothing on
the T1. I have a hardware modem. On the few disconnects, there seems to
be some sort of signal loss occurring, as I not only get disconnected
from EQ, but also from my ISP. It could be caused by a number of reasons
on SOE's side, as well as a much greater number of problems non SOE
related. If it's as a result of SOE's coding, then they should be able
to track it down in a timely manner. If it is related to that code's
interaction with hardware somewhere in the chain between SOE and the
people with problems, then I'm very happy not to work for SOE!! Those
can be a bear to track down. The internet runs on some pretty
interesting technology, not always unrelated to a bowl of spaghetti
organization-wise...
