Hi:

I'm just curious, so I feel that this Newsgroup would my best bet for a
constructive answer. ALL classes have great features, but I'm wondering
which class would be the victor in a one-on-one (Duel) at say, level 60
assuming that both combatants were not pre-buffed by a third party, and that
both combatants are skilled at dueling within the EQ game. I recently
witnessed a duel between an Enchanter and a Mage (though not level 60) and
to be honest the Enchanter was an awesome force whilst the Mage wasn't that
great. It would be my assumption (and I'm probably very wrong) that the top
three for a one-on-one would be ...

1) Enchanter
2) Necromancer
3) Shaman

Thanks in advance to those that answer ...

Stevie.
