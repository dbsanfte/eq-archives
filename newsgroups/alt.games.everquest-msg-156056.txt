Irontaail of Triton (the guy that spent months in PoM) says:
----------------
Mid-lvl and high lvl NON-uber guil monks are reporting they can no longer
solo, inc most light blus ... sort of crippling the mid-lvl monks ... but
here's the bad thing imho:

1 - lvl 60 monk fighting next to me from non-uber guild 100+aa, had to FD
off pulling 1 shroom starting 100% health with single Aeg. He told me after
he could normally solo 1 shroom np and ended up about 50% health. He was
pissed and logged .. so no telling if this was just a bad run or not.

2 - I had group Aeg and my self buffs running ... solo'd 10 shrooms in a
row, no down time, one after the other .. ended 100% health 8-( .. I went
down to 94% health during my lowest fight. I was running 5700hp, 1466 ac
during the fight test. It may be different in VT tonight

But if this is an indication of what happened ... it will truely suck for
mid-lvl, and non-uber guild monks .. and have almost the opposite effect as
was intended ... Im waiting to hear how FoH monks and Kung (high lvl monk on
Povar) report back thier findings on high end conent, as mine was only a
quick test.

-----------------

So it looks like if you already have uber gear, this nerf won't affect you
that much, but if you don't, then it will.
