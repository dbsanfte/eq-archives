From the shadows, the mysterious "James Grahame"
<jamesgrahame@shaw.ca> (if that IS his real name) conspiratorially
whispered:

This is off the mark. I'm fully aware of what a ZEM means. That
doesn't mean I've looked into the exact formula. All I cared about was
which zones had it.


>But you thrashing around after that with the usual "you have no life if you

This is absurd. I didn't say anything remotely like that, and I
challenge you to show where I did. Post proof or retract, as they say.

I'll be here when you find it....
