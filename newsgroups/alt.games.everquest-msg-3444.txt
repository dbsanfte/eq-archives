I did the hermit in Lake Rathe, very mundane 6 min spawn but I was able to
do some reading between spawns, he can take you to 19 after that you can
move on to aviak guards solo. Depends on if you like to group, if you like
to play risky (could charm grifawns in Karanas) or want to group.

LoIO is nice as well.
