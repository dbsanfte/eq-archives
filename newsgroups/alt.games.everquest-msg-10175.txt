I'm curious, which zone(s)?

Just a coffin, nothing else.

Bear in mind, that rather than "on hand" it will need to be in the
bank. If it is on your corpse, then (by definition) you won't have
access to it :)

I only know of one location and from what I've heard it *may* be the
only place on Norrath where they can be bought;

The Cleric Guild in Neriak Commons (set back a little and surrounded
by a "moat", you need to run past it every time you go to 3rd Quarter.

The vendor is immediately in line with the entrance to the building
(on the ground floor). Enter the guild, take a left (or right) there's
a corridor which basically goes round in a loop. At the opposite point
from where you entered (but facing back towards the entrance) there is
a small room with a flamepot and a solitary vendor. This is the guy
who sells coffins.

If there are any other vendors I'd be very interested to know of them.

Also bear in mind that necros and SKs are the only classes which can
use this spell, so don't be too surprised if you have difficulty
buying them if you are anything other than an evil race.
