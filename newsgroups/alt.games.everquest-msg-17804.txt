 I agree. I am so pissed off: I had several friends all lined up to help
me go get one of these damn things with my SK this weekend. OH FRICKIN
WELL. Thanks a ton Verant... Guess I should have bought one for 1k last
week; I saw people auctioning them for 20k last night in OT... To change
this item so that the 2% of the customers who play on PvP won't abuse it
with the "new and improved" pvp invis changes is ridiculous. Just change
it on those servers, thanks.
