I thought this was kind of odd...

www.eqtraders.com

"My many thanks to all you wonderful folks who have sent in donations
to the site. It allowed me to send in a hefty chunk to Refplace to
cover some of the web hosting expenses, plus started recouping my
expenses for memory upgrades (so I could explore Luclin), Dreamweaver
upgrades, etc. It's definitely taken a load off my very overloaded
mind this month."

In other words, the person used donation money for memory upgrades for
their computer to explore Luclin.

I always kind of though these "supposed" donations to such sites were
only to pay for the web hosting services, not to also upgrade the
person's home computer which makes it not so much a donation as you
paying them a living.

Even Lum's did not think it would be right to spend the excess and
kept an ongoing tally of how much they had to still pay web expenses.

So watch which sites you donate to I guess.
