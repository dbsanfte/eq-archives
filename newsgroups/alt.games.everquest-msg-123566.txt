Best course according to whom? As I inferred, it becomes a matter of
whether or not you are able to convince someone that your chosen
course of action was best under given circumstances. According to your
viewpoint what is wrong in one case could be right in another. I don't
agree with that. If it's wrong, it's wrong. Circumstances don't change
that.

I should also clarify that I don't mean killing a person in self
defense is wrong because killing a person for sport is. Those are two
different acts with far different intents. However, killing a person
for sport in a country where it is legal is just as wrong as killing a
person for sport in a country where it isn't.

We're *all* religious, whether we name the deity and follow an
established doctrine or not.
