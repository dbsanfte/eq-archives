Yeah, so at level 50 (or is it 51?) when you can get AAs, when you would 
have earned 10001 xp for either AA or regular, you may instead earn a 
mere 5000 for AA and 5000 for regular, losing a whole xp point.

Alternatively, it is possible, however unlikely, that SoE did it right, 
and caluclated half for AA or regular, then awarded the rest to the other 
type of xp, resulting in a split of 5000 and 5001.  You never know, it is 
possible.  Either way, it's not like you'd ever notice the difference.
