Not that I have any great hopes for this, but isn't Shield
warrior only, and designed to help them protect the vulnerable
robes and healers?

Why didn't that work out and would it be possible to fix it so it
-would- do that job well enough to count for something?

Say for example have it work all the time, so any hits to anyone
in the group accru half to the warrior instead?

Crazy talk eh?
