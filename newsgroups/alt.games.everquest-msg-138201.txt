My wife was complaining about this earlier tonight. She has been
using the bazaar extensively and had never seen it before.

I haven't seen that, but had problems trying to trade a full
Rallic pack to another character. I put it in the trade window
and *bam* I'm LD. After coming back the pack is on my cursor
(phew). Solved by emptying the pack, trading empty pack, then
the contents seperately.
