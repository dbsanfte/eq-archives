Should be 46 after this weekend. And the possibility/impossibility of
getting the upgrades is a personal point of view knowing the abilities
of my guild and the limitations of my current playing hours (I might
semi retire my druid for a while until I get cable so I can do stuff
requiring more than 4 hours during weekends)

Hunting in Velks is out for me for quite a few levels, and I am not
too optimistic about getting to hunt in Kael for a while (although I'd
love to hunt there). Even my ability to get anything Vermiculated will
be limited not only by drop rates but by being able to get in on a
pickup raid for a couple hours, and I only know it's not impossible
because a friend was complaining I wasn't high enough when I was 42
and he was on a Fear raid with no druids present at all.

With different hours, I might be able to try to get one of the other
two more easily... but I still won't scoff the planar tunic.

Also, note that I said *within the next 10 levels*. 10 levels from now
I'll be 55, which seems to be the level you talk about every time you
mention going to Kael Arena for armor...

I'm just being evil mentioning those two :)
(Typical, they give the sweetest item name to the most impossible
thing to get...)
