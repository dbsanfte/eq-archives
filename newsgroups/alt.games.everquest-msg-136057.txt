If I were to forge a guess, I think it's because 21 is considered high
end in the world of monitors (though I'm sure they go much bigger).

When 22's & 23's come out- you'll see a drastic drop in price of 21's.

When 19's came out...17's became sooooo inexpensive...

Personally, I paid about $1100 for a 21inch Monitor about 2.5-3yrs ago
and I don't regret it at all.  One of the few peripherals on the
computer that I use every day and if I can get a good 5yrs out of
it...is the extra 600 bucks worth it? I think so.

Being able to comfortably view the desktop @1280X1024 without
squinting is a real treat.  I think a lot of people run at
1600Xsomething...but I couldn't get into it.

Bah! I'm babbling and offtopic....<grin>
Later...
