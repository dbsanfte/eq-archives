Actually, there are instanced zones you go in for the trials.

First, group makeup.  6 65's, non in the Elementals.  (although
the warrior is 2 kills short, Bert and Saryn I think - he got
his other flags in open raids).

65 BL, 19 aa's, missing 65% slow (only 50)
65 Mage, 69 aa's (12 banked) 
65 Wizard, 34 aa's
65 Warrior, 71 aa's, 8k hp group buffed (before buying
the GoD aa that gave him 100 more)
65 Cleric, 200+ aa's
65 Druid, 200+ aa's

We tried the treatment plant trial.  We can easily take single mobs in
there, and they are, mostly, easily single pulled.  We got in a bit of
a hurry just before we got to the NPC we needed to hail - we lost the
cleric before I could get the 2nd mob slowed and off him.  Since we
couldn't rez him in place we evacced, quit the expedition (to pop his
body) then got him back to Barindu.

2nd try we were running low on time (the warrior needed to go) and again
got hurried in that room - we tried to sneak past and got a roamer on us
that chain another mob from in the room.  Bit of a wipe and called it a
day.  We're sure we can get to the NPC - it's just being careful of the
adds.  We've taken pairs - but it's always a close thing.  2 63+ 1200
hitters in camp is *scarey*.  These guys have fairly low HP for their 
level, and we appeared to be getting aroun 2.25% or more aa per kill.
(I saw 2%,2%,2%,3% several times)

For a bit of a spoiler on the first 3 expeditions go
