After I installed Trilogy over my original EQ, I have been unable to
unroll anything. Specifically at splitpaw, you get scrolls, you're
supposed to be able to unroll to see if it 1,2,3 or 4. likewise I
started a new Iksar monk, and you get the guildmaster note. Right
click on it does nothing. I also got some book to deliver with
instructions to read it on the way. Guess what. Right click - nothing.
Whats up? Is there a trick to this?
