As is often the case with Verant, they chose the wrong solution. Heck,
it isn't just Verant, either. Software companies do this sort of thing

I spent the past week stripping features and code *out* of a large
project I've been working on for a long time, because it was making
the application more complicated (and hence, error prone) than it
needed to be.
