Well...the timing was good.  I just found this page of videos:

http://camelot.stratics.com/movies/Aladora.shtml

and the "For Albion" video has me wanting to go play my Cleric in DAoC, and
defend Albion, so maybe this patch is a good time to take a little EQ break,
until they straighten things out. :-)

(The "Hero" video on that page is very good, too.  It's basically a music
video for Bonnie Tyler's "Holding Out For A Hero", done with video capture
from DAoC, rather than live people).
