Head over to casters realm (even if you intend to play a melee class),
and check out their character creation guides:

I'd suggest starting over and paying more attention to stat
distribution. It's not like you've wasted your time - most people end up
playing a character or two before settling on their main, just until
they learn the ropes, so to speak. But its better to write off a couple
of weekends of learning the game now than to level your character up for
months before deciding you should have dumped more points in INT or
whatever. And you can always twink out your new character with the money
and equipment you have now, so getting up to the same level shouldn't be
too painful.
