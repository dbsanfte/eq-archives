Let me just point out that the low/mid level game (L20 to L44) was
utterly destroyed by a change made strictly for the convenience of
high level raiders.  Despite a great deal of interesting new content
the low/mid game will never recover from this blow, IMO, even though
the agent of its destruction has been removed.  And the mid/high
level game (L45 to L59) is still affected 24x7 by this same change,
especially for "casual" players (the raiders don't give a damn, they
don't really play the same game, they're just passing through in a
hurry).  Note that this same change has contributed to the current
Warrior issues in the area mid/high and high level XP grouping.

Now, if they can do this much damage in the name of "convenience",
just imagine what sort of fallout is possible should they try to
deal with a balance issue that has roots in just about every part
of the game's architecture, from their "vision" of the classes'
roles, to encounter balance and itemization at all levels of the
game.
