Just to relate my own experience....

This Saturday,  I logged on as the group I raid with was doing Vindi in
preparation for for a Statue of Rallos Zek kill in Kael.

I attempted to buy a port to Wakening Lands so I could join the raid.  Even
offering 100 pp in my auction / ooc for the port, (or TL) I was unable to
find any takers in Plane of Knowledge, the Nexus, Shadowhaven or the Bazaar.

By the time I asked in guild, and a friend logged to her wizard and ported
me there, they were already done CoH'ing, buffed and working on the Statue
pull.   Too late to join.
