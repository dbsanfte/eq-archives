Er... well, there's about 3 bajillion items that have effects on them,
so no I can't provide that info.  eq.allakhazam.com has the best info
on items although you shouldn't trust the prices listed too much.
Mmm... ziphandel's info was already covered in another post, that is
THE best place to go to learn specifically about focus effects.  I'm
afraid that until you kind of get to know items and effects and stuff,
a lot of your time may be spent writing stuff down to look up when you
log off of EQ to see what it does, unless you're fortunate enough to
own two computers.
