If you were the main tank (or main assist) all your group should
have assisted you.  Someone should have mezzed rooted the non-caster
if any could (never played chanter so not sure when mez comes in or
if you even had one).

As far as not hitting MOB and backing away to lower aggro goes, that
is very much incident sensitive.  All depends on group make-up.  If
2 tanks then MA can stop hitting and let secondary take the heat for
a bit until healers get the healing done.  Generally speaking
running around like a headless chicken = bad.

Get some hot keys made and make sure to let all in group know who is
the main assist and have them make an assist key like /assist %T
(with this one they have to target person and it will take them
right to MOB he/she has targeted and put attack mode on when key is
hit) and another /assist "your name here" (with this key it will
always go to MOB person named has targeted and put attack mode on).
Have fun
