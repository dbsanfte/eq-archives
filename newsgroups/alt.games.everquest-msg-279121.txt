Well... out of boredom I extended my quest:

Phase 4 beta - (final phase):

Test
Fennin Ro 
Rallos Zek (PvP) 
Tarrew Marr
The Rathe 
Xegony


Prior to Phase 4, I beleive (Because it predates me), but comments in

was just: 

Test

PS this was gleaned from a quick scan of posts dated Feb 1999 in 
alt.games.everquest (where else!)
