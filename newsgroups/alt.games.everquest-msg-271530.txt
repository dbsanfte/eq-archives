Eveyone keeps bringing this up.. .so I'll just say that I looked up
the info on grouping on a number of web sites to check into the
grouping thing. I've been fairly tired recently, which isn't unusual
for me actually, but the descriptions on how to group, do agro, etc.
weren't very clear. Didn't seem like an intuitive explanation. They
read like, if you knew what grouping and getting agro was about, you
would understand the explanation, otherwise no.
