My Necro gets asked for DMF a lot.  Every single time at the DLs Druid portal
for example.  Just to clarify Dead Man Floating (DMF) gives:

Water Breathing
See Invis
Levitate
+70 to Poison Resist

Lasts *72* minutes and requires NO reagent.  It is so useful in fact that they
had to completely nerf its usage in some zones.  Druid/Ranger/Shaman etc
Levitate is very much the K-Mart version. :p
