Lol - downtime can be some of the most fun part of the game - although
I can't tell you how often I've wished for the abitlity to make my
pet /emote.  As broke as I am, as much as I need every cent to get my
63/64 spells (less so now after my little death loop incident :-/ ) I
will snap up the first preserved chokidai vocal chords or envenomed 
sleeves I see - regardless if it means I have to trade in my HORSE to
get the things - just for the ability to finally make Spike talk.  Spike
has been a member of our regular group since we started hanging out
with each other - to the point where people in the group wave bye to
spike or hug him before we TP out at the end of a session.

We go to high danger/low xp places (planks in CT anyone :) merely for
the fun of handling multiple 55+ mobs at one time rather than the
single pull, constant kill treadmill of a grind group in PoV.  There
it's more like - pull and kill 3 or 4 mobs, everyone is OOM, let's 
hang out for a few minutes and gab.
