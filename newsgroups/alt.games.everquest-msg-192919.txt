The main problem with warrior/shaman is that you're a bit limited as
to your hunting grounds. You don't have FD to split mobs or snare to
stop runners (unless you have a troll shaman with the snare necklace).
If you don't mind those limits, warrior/shaman is an extremely
powerful combo as far as pure killing power goes. 

If you ask the 'experts' (shaman's crucible, the shaman message
boards) what the best melee partner is for a shaman,  the overwhelming
answer will be Shadow knight. Over 60% last time I saw a poll on the
subject.
