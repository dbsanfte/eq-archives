That was me. But it just isn't EQ2 for me. It was the same in EQ1 (and
DAoC). I've (and my wife) have just had *very* bad luck on raids. We
haven't been on one where either her or I (or both) hasn't walked away
without a death (or multiple). Picture a Raid roach spray commercial in
your head... I'm the roach.

As far as Ho's are concerned I think in EQ2 they'll be as much a part of
raids as in regular groups. Since the raid content in EQ2 is (purportedly)
on a much smaller scale (I've read of 2 to 3 groups max) while EQ1's max is
(I could be wrong) 72 players. It will certainly help the encounter but I
doubt if it became the defining raid maneuvers such as chain CH's and other
assorted EQ1 tactics. Look at it like a nice bonus.
