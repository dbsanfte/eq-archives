Friends,

I'm a 51 Erudite Enchanter. I'm curious what other Enchanters out
there keep on their spell list. Here's mine for typical pick up
grouping:

1: Stun (Color Shift - 20th level 6 second AoE stun)
2: Stun (Color Flux � 4th level 4 second AoE stun)
3: Root (Enstil � 29th level 96 second root � I don't have the 49th
level 3min root yet)
4: Mez (Dazzle � 49th level 96 second mez)
5: Mez (Mesmerize � 4th level 24 second mez)
6: Mez (Mesmerization � 16th level 24 second AoE mez � a real life
saver)
7: Slow / Debuff (see note 1)
8: Swap (see note 2)

Note 1: When there is no Shaman in the group, my Slow spell goes here
(Shiftless Deeds � 44th level 65% slow). When there is a Shaman in the
group, I usually have Incapacitate � 44th level debuff, but I'm kind
of dissatisfied with this option. I don't find Tash particularly
useful in regular xp groups. My DoTs don't have time to run their
course. My DD? That's more of a solo spell, besides, I've got better
uses for my mana. Another mez maybe? Boon of the Garou? Oooh. Maybe
Theft of Thought. I just got this spell, but haven't had a chance to
try it. Any advice here would be welcome.

Note 2: I use my 8th slot to swap in party buffs and utilities
(Clarity, Swift Like the Wind, Pacify, Illusions, etc.). When not
holding a buff, I usually keep a mem blur � usually Blanket of
Forgetfulness � 49th AoE mem blur. I'm thinking of switching to
Recurring Amnesia � 49th single target MBOT (Mem Blur Over Time). I
just got that spell and haven't had much opportunity to play with it
yet. Thoughts?

You'll notice a few lower level spells. Notably the stuns in the first
two slots. The lower level stuns are faster casting and that's my main
concern. Even the four second stun gives me enough time to fire off a
root or mez and back off. They are almost never interrupted and almost
never fizzle.

The 4th level mez is there for mana cost. At twenty mana, it is
virtually free to cast, not to mention that it never fizzles. I also
use it to mez mobs I'm about to charm. Mez, Tash, Charm. Twenty four
seconds is just enough time to fire these off with a comfortable
margin and have mez wear off almost right after the Charm hits. If you
are an Enchanter who charms, I highly recommend this method.

I'm kind of disappointed with Dazzle, my 49th level mez. For one, it
takes a little longer to cast. My focus item only affects spells up to
44th level, but that's a minor issue. The big disappointment is the
recast time. It has a five second recast time. If I've just AoE mezzed
a pack of four or five mobs, that five second recast time on the
longer lasting mez is gonna get me killed (and has).

I've been thinking of going back to my 34th level seventy two second
mez. It has a much more manageable recast time. Or even replacing the
4th level mez with the 34th level one, then alternate between the two
when mezzing a big group of mobs. Anyone have any thoughts on this?

Notably absent from my spell list is a form of Tash. I only use Tash
when I'm about to charm a mob. That's it. I suppose in a raid
situation, I would keep it in my seven or eight slot, but this is for
regular xp grouping. To be useful, it really needs to be cast early in
a fight. But if cast early, it usually gets me aggro. By the time the
tanks have established enough aggro to make Tash safe to cast, it's
not really worth it. Plus, I just don't have the slot for it. (Well,
maybe slot seven if there's a Shaman in the group.)

Well, that's it. My typciall xp group spell line up. Naturally, there
may be minor alterations depending on the situation. If the group is a
little tank shy, for example, I may slip my DoT in there somewhere. If
a Monk is single pulling, I'll setup a little more charm friendly
linup. And, of course, charm soloing is a tad different. Well, not
really. I'll just spend a lot of time memming spells in and out of
slots seven and eight (Slow, DoT, DD, DBuff, Charm, Tash, etc.)

(A little subnote to all you single pullers out there. Single pulls
are dull. Enchanters get bored with single pulls. We start looking
around for stuff to charm just to stay interested. If there is an
Enchanter in your group, give them something to do. At least two at a
time. Three would be best, and just to keep us on our toes, the
occasional four or five pull would be great. We can almost always
handle it :)

Anyways, I want to hear what other Enchanters out there are doing. I'm
looking forward to learning from the differences and similarities.
