Druid spot:  fairly safe.  Make sure you're sow'd or ready to sow yourself
upon entry.  Make sure you have snare memmed.  It's kinda unlikely it's
going to actually STICK on those critters, but it's possible.  The only
thing you have to worry about in Skyfire is chromadracs (dragonflies) since
they dispel.  If you're sow'd and haven't made yourself hated by Gorenaire
or Talsomething (he's the Kunark Naggy), which is unlikely 'cause I don't
think you CAN hurt that faction yet, nothing else will kill you.

Go East and South to get to Burning Wood.  Go east and follow the wall
(after you go past the big gap that heads to Burning Wood) and it'll take
you to a temple in the rock thing...that's OT zone.

Wizard spot: much more of a pain...make sure you're sow'd before you go.  Go
towards the nearest zone wall (I think south) and hang a left to go to OT,
right to hit the big gap that leads to BW.  My wizard has only used this
once so far so I may be mistaken (my druid has ported dozens of times to
SF).

EJ druid spot:  FAIRLY safe but get sow'd ASAP.  Snaring here should be much
easier.  I BELIEVE you go SE to TT and NW to FoB.  It's a wooded zone so
kinda scary if you get lost.  What I do when I get there is turn around and
find the closest wall and run to it, then hang a left to get to TT.  When
you get to the ruins hang a right there.  There's also a big ol' log laying
at the zone line.

Wizard spot:  Been there twice...both times took me a while to figure out
where the hell I was ('cause my druid has also ported there dozens of
times).  I wouldn't consider this one particularly safe at 39.  I think it's
much more north than the druid spot.  Run south along the wall to I think
any crease in the wall if you want to get to FoB (you should be able to
climb to the top in the middle of the creases).  Keep running, hang a left
and follow that wall east and you'll find TT.
