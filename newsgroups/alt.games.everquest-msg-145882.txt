    It's an upgraded Feign Death. You Will Want This.

    The effect is no longer "FT II and 15% buff extension". The effect is
now simply "20% buff extension." In addition, the eighth shawl has FT III on
it. Not only is it an upgrade, but it's now quite obvious to all that the FT
on the shawl is subject to the 15 points of FT cap.

    Oooh, I love this one too. ;-)

    They also upgraded Vex Thal items. While this might not mean much to the
average Joe, I'm more than pleased that my shiny red gloves now give me +15%
to Blacksmithing instead of the old +5%. Before, I was going to ask another
dwarven smith to make my 46 WAR some Enchanted Dwarven Plate (the old
stuff) - now I'm going to try it myself!
