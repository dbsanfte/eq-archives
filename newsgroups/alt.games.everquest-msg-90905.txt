I don't care what you're attempting to root.  Tell me after you've
accomplished it.

Don't give a crap, don't tell us, no one cares.

Lull doesn't work after critters are aggroed...only the person you're
helping pull will care that you're casting it, no need for spam.

Lose this one FAST, I REALLY don't give a crap to know that a nuker is doing
their job...and any nuker worth a damn knows how to nuke and NOT get aggro
very often.

%T CHARMED and %T MEZZED aren't listed but important.  My CHARM macro
includes a "/pet who leader"  line to emphasize.  I disagree that 2 lines
are necessary but for the important ones I'm not likely to bitch.

What I DO bitch about are people who have a freaking macro for every cast
(bad enough), and they don't get to the point until the SECOND LINE (even
worse).  Or the "role-player" ranger/pally who feel that they need to do a
macro before every fight exclaiming their hate for the creature, and how
it's going to die a horrible death.  Cute the first dozen times, really
annoying after that.
