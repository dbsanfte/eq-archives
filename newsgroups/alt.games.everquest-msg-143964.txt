70dps is what he says an unhasted warrior does with endgame weapons does

70dps is what he says he does with epic and self spell haste

70dps is probably what he says a manaburning squad on Woushi does

70dps is probably what he says a cleric pet does

70dps is his answer to life, the universe and everything (when we all
know it's closer to 42dps)
