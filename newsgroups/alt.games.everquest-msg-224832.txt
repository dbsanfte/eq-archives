I think you're going to definitely want this one. LDoN is really an entirely
new game within a game and I'm having enormous fun with it. There are some
spells available that I *believe* are unique to LDoN, but I'm not really
sure about that, I just haven't seen them anywhere else (e.g., spells that
detect and disarm trapped containers found in LDoN adventures). Although
most spells can theoretically be obtained at the Bazaar, most people
purchasing spells with adventure points are probably going to scribe the
scroll rather than sell it (although I can see a business model for
purchasing a Remove Greater Curse for 800pts and then selling it in the
Bazaar for mucho plats).

Another point to make is that there are many "augmentations" found as loot
in LDoN adventures. These can be easily added to any item of equipment for
nice stat or resistance buffs and every one of them that I've seen so far is
a NODROP, even on Firiona Vie.
