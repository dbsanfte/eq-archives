Not to continue feeding an argument, but groups constantly vary. I mentioned
Disease Cloud and Shadow Vortex (once again proving how things can be
different). Around Enchanters, it's foolish to use DOTs, so Shadow Vortex is
the better choice. However, Disease Cloud is pretty much the best taunt
available, so I find it a lot better to use in groups where I absolutely
must make a quick aggro-adjustment - ones without Enchanters to mes. So with
that one variable, one tactic works well in one area, but poorly in the
other.

I stick to my argument that there are times I'd rather have AC as opposed to
Haste, and of course, vice versa. -But of course, if I had a Cloak of Flames
I would wear it constantly...
