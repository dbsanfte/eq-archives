People like Darktyger drove you to quit EQ? That's a stretch.

Please don't. 

To be honest you're account is practically worthless. 

The characters on it simply aren't worth the risk of violating even a 
barely enforced eula. For 30 bucks you can get a box set with 
exquivalent expansions and with a week or less /played any experienced 
player could likely replace those characters if he or she so desired.
