Hahahahahahaha!
While both are hardly in the league as AoW, saying the Statue is
easier than Derakor is misleading.  Derakor is a stupidly easy mob,
trivial to manage aggro and the damage output is weak in relation to
an "uber" mob.

Statue on the other hand, but the sheer number of hitpoints makes him
a bit of a challenge unless you bring the same number of people as LoS
did for the AoW.
