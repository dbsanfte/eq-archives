sorry i did not catch the class when i read it the first time .. just
reminded me of a few experinces i have had ...

as you might have gathered i have not had a good experance with a froggie
yet .. infact we have failed our missions every time we are grouped with one
..

I know it is slightly unfare to genralise a race .. but so fat the only
froggies i have seen have been rude , ninja looters and pore at there class
..  I wish to see one someday that in actualy a good player ..

( i might be slightly biased agaist them for what they made the dark elves
share a town with - never liked the slimy things anyway .. but still i have
not seen anything about them to make me change my mind )
