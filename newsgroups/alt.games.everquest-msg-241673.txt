}> But, why ruing all that perfectly good stuff with cream cheese?
}Because of the original recipe:
}Digby p. 228/177
}http://www.kal69.dial.pipex.com/isbn769.htm
}Cut pieces of quick, fat, rich, well tasted cheese, (as the best of 
}Brye, Cheshire, &c. or sharp thick Cream-Cheese) into a dish of thick 
}beaten melted Butter, that hath served for Sparages or the like, or 
}pease, or other boiled Sallet, or ragout of meat, or gravy of Mutton: 
}and, if you will, Chop some of the Asparages among it, or slices of 
}Gambon of Bacon, or fresh-collops, or Onions, or Sibboulets, or 
}Anchovis, and set all this to melt upon a Chafing-dish of Coals, and 
}stir all well together, to Incorporate them; and when all is of an equal 
}consistence, strew some gross White-Pepper on it, and eat it with tosts 
}or crusts of White-bread. You may scorch it at the top with a hot 
}Fire-Shovel.

Oh. Wow.  That sounds really good...  Mmmmm.... Bacon... Bacony cheese 
bacon mmm! :)

}Creamcheese [or even drained quark] can correct the 
}fat content without fardling up the protein content that just doubling 
}the amount of butter would do.

3 extra-special brownie points for using a cool word like 'fardling'. :)
