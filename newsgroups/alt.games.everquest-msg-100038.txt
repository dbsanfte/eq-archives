It didnt work for me; I installed new video drivers from nvidia.

Now everything looks awesome. I can see ogre but through our SK's tomato
like ToV ringmail. I can see skimpy wood elves freezing to death in Velious.
My neck is no longer dyed, and wood elf male chain armour has interesting little
patterns and curls and holes in it their skin shows through.

Some armour is only tinted on certain parts - chain tinted, but leather straps
and so on left alone.

It looks *great*
