When the avarage lvl is 54 it is very hard to get the Kei scroll. Its not
simple take one mob down and you have Kei but it is an very rare drop.

Take a look here http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8504 for
the known drops but I think it is a better way to hunt some easier zone's
and buy the KEI scroll on the bazaar. Last time it was sold for 50k on the
Nameless.
