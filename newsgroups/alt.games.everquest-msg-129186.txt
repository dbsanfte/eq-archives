Good point, heh, though I personally stopped using porcupining as a primary
tactic around 22-25.  I've always had relatively high AC/hp for a druid,
have 871 ac 1842 hp (209 wis +510 mana) self buffed at 55.

Defense is definitely good to raise, I had mine in the 160-170 range for a
while, then I focused on getting hit a little more often (moved into
dungeons, better exp too) and had it up to 190 or so by level 49, powered my
way through 49 and 50 quadding wyverns (boring as hell though), then back
into the dungeons for the most part, finally hit 200 defense in 53 though.

I do get wierd looks though for wearing Gladiator Chain sleeves though (16
ac 20 hp, some saves, but no wis/mana).  (and my new Elysian legs help the
ac/hp a LOT with 16 ac 50 hp 15 sta).  Now if only those lousy skellies
would drop me an Elysian tunic so I can look like a ranger.  Well, and maybe
switch my Grey flesh gloves back for coldain skin for the ac/sta  (I want to
hit 900 AC and 2k hp self buffed, though my self ac/ds buff upgrade next
level will help the ac part a bit)

Anyways, yeah, 6 ac 65 hp rings are an excellent value for just about anyone
until you can upgrade to something like a Shadel Bandit Ring (god I wish
they weren't lore though)
