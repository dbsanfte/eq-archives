getting a task can be a bit hard ...I went to EC and the NPC was
underground...hehehe..the rest said they didn't have anything suitable.
We hailed the PoD in Halas and ended up in DScar, it was great fun.....the
mobs were dk blue to me (51) and my bf's Shammy (44) which was unusual, we
were grouped.
Mobs resisted spells more than expected and whacked the pets down a bit,
it's great when you don't know what to expect....except for death of course,
but we avoided that for the night.
Not sure what the bus is supposed to fix, whether it be people who haven't
bought omens get to see the new zones...but it would be a great marketing
ploy/opportunity to see what you are missing out on =)
Roll on Friday!
