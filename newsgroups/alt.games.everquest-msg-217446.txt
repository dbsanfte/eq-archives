I went defensive to live through pulls (and I got a lot of those AAs back
when monks were actually considered a valid tank choice).  The double
riposte and return kick were just to get to sensei title.  :)  I still don't
have critical mend (though if I'd known how badly return kick and double
riposte would suck...) because I'm not a big fan of "chance" AAs.  If I
can't count on a critical mend, I can't depend on a critical mend.  It's on
my list after I get some more DPS AAs that I'm currently working on.

Also, I'm just an officer, though I probably run higher profile than the
guildleader cause of my mouth.  :)

We do things "small" (ironic that a 60-man takedown of RZ can be considered
"small").  We're also mostly employed and have a fixed raid schedule rather
than raids being called randomly.  As such, we've never caught Emperor yet. 
Someday.

While the guild of schoolkids that can get on at 3:30 in the afternoon is
killing Emperor, we racked up an insane number of BoT towers.  They were
probably a rather poor second choice to VT, but you take what you can get. 
Sol Ro was a popular grind zone for us for quite a while before we got RZ
too.

There are three guilds in Time, two of them allied, three more in
elementals, and two more guilds that are coming up fast, one farming VT, one
working on getting into elementals without VT cause we showed them it was
possible.  The competition is pretty fierce, though amicable for the most
part.  There is one guild that has a frustrating habit of walking over our
corpses to kill a mob that we just tried for the first time, but they don't
take it any further than that.  Rodcet used to be full of battling guilds,
but ironically PoP made all the guilds that used to battle form up into
monster guilds.  :)

Well, we've hit a couple avatars in Air, a couple rings in Earth and the
gator, and a few things in Water (said guild that walks over our corpses
took Hydrotha after we got him to 9% last night, our first time seeing him). 
Oh, and we've beat our heads against the wall on Grioihin "Fucking Annoying"
the Wise.  Haven't hit much in Fire, though that does seem to be the new
popular grind zone when members aren't playing in LDoN.

We actually have a guild roster with the ability for members to update
themselves (flags, keys, AAs, alts, etc.), RP (dkp) system including a full
mob/item/tactics database, and more (notice the "login" in the upper right
corner that works off the message board's login).  It's a fantastic
system that I can't take any credit for.  :)  We just never bothered to open
it up to the public, probably for one reason you already mentioned.  We're
*not* all that well equipped, having skipped NToV *and* VT.  So we brag
about our accomplishments, because if we bragged about our equipment we'd
get laughed at.  :)

Avatars on the boards get a bit screwy sometimes.  I thought I'd caught all
the supersized ones though.
