Good point...

I dunno.. I am a complex person and this is a complex issue.  

On the one hand, I agree with EE when he said he doesn't mind gay
people but he doesn't want it to be "forced" upon him or he doesn't
want to have to agree with it.  I agree with that sentiment...

On the other hand, you raise a valid point with your don't ask don't
tell attitude.

So many gay people like to flaunt their "status".  They are the
activist types, the protestor types. The types who DO want "special
rights"  And it is THEIR actions that make it harder for the regular
everyday gay people.  The ones who just want to go about their lives,
who just happen to enjoy something that is sexually and intimatly
different then what society considers "normal". 

Being in a sexually different environment myself, I can understand and
appreciate their frustrations.
