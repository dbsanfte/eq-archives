      What I typically see is people in the late teens and early 20s
coming to the zone for the dungeon zone experience bonus, fighting
random stuff in the yard, then leaving for other safe, well-known
zones rather than advance to the stuff inside the house.  If all
you're in it is for the XP grind, there is no reason to risk massive
trains and death by going inside when there is equivalent experience
to be found safer elsewhere.  For two weeks, I would do a /who and
see absolutely NO ONE between 25 and 55 -- the zone contained
nothing but grinders in the yard and uber-high-level folks there
for specific quests (the Bard epic, if I'm not mistaken).
