Heh seeing virii and worms come and go I guess I'm just a bit overcautious
on these things. I usually install on my alternate machine first (with no
online access) anything I download from any p2p app. Like I said, I don't
know the technical ins and outs so it's good to hear I don't have to worry
that much about it.
