ok, here's a quick suggestion list:

face - Acrylia Studded mask (10-25pp)
Arms - Ulthork Arms (25-200pp) or Platinum Armband
Wrists - Polished Bone Bracers (75pp)
hands - Split Paw Hide Gloves (5-30pp)
back - Spore Covered Cloak (only +1 wis, but should be cheap)
waist - Crystalline Belt (think that's name 50pp)
secondary - Testament of Vanear (FREE except for the gold required to get
first piece)

you've got some nice, expensive gear there (rings, club) - far better than
my druid did at that levle.
