We're actually having our annual 3 days of non-shitty weather at the 
moment.  Too bad there's no sun.

Colorado was actually on my list of places to check out after I defrost 
for a few years back in California.  I went on a road trip with my family 
a while back (10+ years now I think) around the Colorado Springs area and 
it was quite nice.  Have an old high school friend living in Denver who I 
talk to occasionally and she has had nothing but nice stuff to say as 
well.  Girlfriend has also indicated she might like it there.  Not hard 
to beat CA's cost of living either :P
