this reminds me of something strange that happened when i made a druid once.
I named him "Muld", but somewhere along the creation process, my computer
suddenly froze. After a few minutes i was thrown back to the login screen,
and when i logged back on i was the proud owner of a halfling druid named
"Mul"....must be the only 3-letter-named toon in game....or did anyone else
try the same thing?
