Hi Nightwind,

Well you can make sandwiches out of the meat you have got and that does 
involve using your baking skill but it is quite easy to make the sandwiches.

Or there are numerous quests you can do to get free food, you can look 
them up on www.allakhazam.com.

Or you can just buy ordinary rations. Buying food will not burn too big 
a hole in your pocket and as you level the amount of money you earn and 
gain will increase.
