That was wrong then.. because on the earlier mobs it doesnt matter if you
wipe.. nothing has been handed in at this point, somebodies entire epic is
not in the balance

I can't even begin to understand why somebody would say this.  It would be
like telling the magician to cast a DS on the main tank, and then sit down
and cast nothing else.  Even though he can give mana (at the fastest rate),
the most powerful pets, second most powerful nukes etc... just tell him to
DS, and sit down for the fight.

It sounds like the raid leader was a complete idiot... I know who I wouldnt
be re-inviting for the second try if I lost all my epic on his raid

His main burst of damage is the HT.. I forget how much exactly because its
so long ago, but its around 1k damage.  Anyway, the puller would have taken
the HT during the initial agro and it wouldn't have recycled in-time for the
tank to also be HT'd

I was level 60, but in VERY ordinary gear (uber crescent slippers!, RBG,
fungi, fist/tier'dal sai, no epic, some cloak since I was level 10 etc)

I probably had 4k hp max back then, when i tanked him.   Any 55+ warrior is
going to beat that HP
