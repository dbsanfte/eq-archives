I've been playing a bard, though casually, to level 60, twisting a lot
all the way.  My wrists have never hated me.  Nor have they even been
mildly annoyed.  So it's a matter of not playing for extended hours,
which is quite rare for me.  Max is 4 hours.  Repetitive motion - bad.

Also, I'd characterize a bard as a *rogue* / enchanter combination,
that can cast mostly mana-free songs while moving and fighting.  We
get several rogue skills, such as pick lock, sense and disarm traps,
though not to the degree that rogues get them.  We also do not get
that major rogue-defining skill backstab, nor do we get to sneak while
hiding.
