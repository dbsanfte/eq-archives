Read what I posted Freek <sic> then try to look out from beyond your
blinkers.

Once any 'enhancement' is widely spread, it will cease to have any
effect, whether by nerfing it directly, or indirectly by tuning
encounters to take effect of it. Take warrior defensive discipline.
Oops, shouldn't have put that in should they, it's too powerful!
Solution: Make mobs untankable unless you use defensive. Oops, CH is a
bit too powerful already, even more so with cast time reductions, lets
bolt on an exclusion to CH with these focuses, and patch it up!

One point I'm making, that you seems to have ignored, is that come PoP,
encounters will be tuned to assume everyone has focus items at all
times. 

The second point is that casters will have several slots effectively
removed from improvement upgrade routes. High end mobs will either have
loot slots 'wasted' by containing upgrades for those slots that no-one
will want, or will have such a small amount of caster loot in total as
to make casters feel left out.

I don't see this as the 'improvement' you seem to think it is, but
rather as a disaster waiting to happen. Caster rebalancing isn't as
simple as giving every mana user (except bards of course) a huge boost.
If everyone in the game got a flat 200hp bonus every 10 levels, would
that make things 'better'? Of course not, it would just raise the bar.
These focus items are fraught with potential problems, and make an
interesting debate IMO. If you don't think so, that's your prerogative,
but don't bitch for the sake of bitching about me bitching for the sake
of bitching when I'm not.
