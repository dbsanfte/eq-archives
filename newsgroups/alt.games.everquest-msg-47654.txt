Well, no. Since the alignments are limited by race AND class AND
deity, I wouldn't have listed the 'non viable why aren't these
shamans' in the first place. It's kinda like if you'd tried listing a
good aligned druid as non viable since tunare followers can be good,
wood elves can be good, but druids can only be neutral. With the non
viable listing, it's as if you're assuming only the race and class
limitations matter and the deity limitation is something separate.
They're not non viable, they're impossible, just like lawful good dark
elves.
