Its 235. Casters Realm shows 235 for me. Where are you reading 250?

Wizards have the ability to 'critcal' spells and they get increased chances
with AA points. Other classes can gain the ability to 'critical' spells with
AA points.

The 'critical' has a chance to do extra damage, I don't think it can be
as high as double damage but I may be wrong.

Specialization just has a chance to reduce the mana cost of spells
in that school.
