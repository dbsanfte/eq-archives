Barbarian shaman always have been good to me.

On the other end of the spectrum, enchanters can be arrogant
and annoying.  I should know... I play one.  It's probably because
people keep breaking our beautiful mezzes.  "Please everyone
assist the tank.  Don't turn from the mob the tank is attacking until
it is dead, then assist the tank on the next mob he attacks.  Okay?
*mumbling*  - next pull brings 3 mobs two of which get mezzed
but immediately broken -  three people on one mob each.
/sigh"
