Frenzy is the special skill you are thinking of.  I can double frenzy at 
sometimes on that, and also frenzy hits for more than my regular melee hits 
most of the time.
They also get leg chop skill, very similar to snare, costs an axe to cast 
but it's instant and manaless.  The axes cost 1 component per 20.  Not a 
bad skill to have.

I chose Barb for my berzerker.  Glad I didn't choose vahshir, all the quest 
containers are bugged and the poor cats can't do any of their class quests.
