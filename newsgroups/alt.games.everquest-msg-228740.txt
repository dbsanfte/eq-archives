Mages were balanced around it according to lead programmer Rich Waters.
Also when mages asked for more mana reg we were told to "look to our pets".

Aside from that, FD was never intended to be used as a pulling tool but for
aggro removal for some dps classes. This has been said by several SOE /
Verant employees.
When can we expect to see FD nerfed?

Oh wait, it is now a core ability, just like pet-canni was the manareg tool
for mages!
