My apologies, I am not usually so sloppy. I was
thinking one thing and wrote another. I meant to
write El Olam, not Yahweh.

> To my understanding, and I *could* be

Some people don't like to say it, this doesn't
mean it wasn't 'designed' to be pronounced.

>composed of the Hebrew
>letters Yud Heh Vahv Heh...

Yes, the Tetragrammaton, no doubt familiar to all
those Wiccans out there.

>  When those letters are seen, people say
>"Adonai", instead... 

Some people, not all people... Jews in particular

> Yahweh doesn't -mean- anything, let alone
>'Eternal'.... 

Well, it certainly doesn't mean eternal, but some
people believe its meaning has roots in other
languages. As you would expect from any religious
discussion, there are contrasting sides to this.

>It's just a derivation of the name for the Judeo-Christian
>deity. 

Derivation of what name?

>Now, the word Leolahm means Eternal, or Forever...

Yes, once again, my apologies.
