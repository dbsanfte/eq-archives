Unfortunately its also competely useless... results in some lame druid
spell thats no drop.

The original POTC quest also results in that same spell, of course,
but MY reason for wanting to do it would be the very nice earring
that also results.  Of course my Druid friend will also appreciate the
spell (more than I will anyway!) but will want to do the quest twice,
as it results in -two- nice earrings for her, one druid only and the
other the same one I'm angling for.

POTC isn't -quite- as lame as I make out, actually I'll be glad to
see her get it, as I can't think of a spell I'd less like to have on me
than POTG, and we partner a lot; having a single target spell
means she'll spend less mana keeping it on herself and we won't have
to disband and regroup every time she wants to refresh it.  Still,
for my -cleric- its beyond lame to the point of discarding.
