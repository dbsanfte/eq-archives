Just as a second point of data, I logged the faction hits it took to go from
(almost) max kos to ally Ring of Scale.  I logged over 3000 hits.   I
estimate 3100 to 3200 is the actual number of hits.  The difference being
due to a few times the log got started late, and some newbie powerleveling
in Mistmoore after becoming max kos, but before trying to raise faction.
