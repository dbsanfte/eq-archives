The old xp route used to be newbie zone->LoIO->OT->DL->KC.  The xp 
modifier in OT is not that high, but, there are plenty of mobs, and you 
can work your way around the zone as you level to get to the higher level 
mobs until you are ready for the next zone.  You can usually do nonstop 
pulling there.
