TOFS has something for most levels.

Mistmoore is also good for the level range that you've stated. There are a
few class specific drops, and the xp is not bad well into the 40's if you
keep your pull rate up.

I also like the Kaesora idea. You can fight your way down to the Xalgoz camp
and, if he pops a few times for you, get fangs and work on your Charassis
keys (which your 50's are ready for, and you're lower toons will get there
someday).
