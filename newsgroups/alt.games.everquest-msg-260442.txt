Oh they do stack.  As a Ranger I can cast lower level Druid fire DoTs
(Immolate or Flamelick) while the Druid is casting higher level
versions and mine goes on just fine.  And yeah, I'm pretty sure the
debuff will not stack.  What I wasn't sure about is what the change
was.  IIRC it used to be that the highest level DoT would stick, no
matter what, and overwrite all others.  Then a while back they changed
it to make things more reasonable.  I believe the change was that they
allowed two or more tree-huggers to cast a fire DoT instead of only
the best one winning between them all.  Not sure if they changed
anything about higher and lower versions on the same line stacking
though.
