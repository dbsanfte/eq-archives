According to the chart, EQ has 1.6% of the market.  If WoW has 6-7
million subscribers, then EQ must still have in the neighborhood of
200,000.  I don't know what SoE charges a month, but that must be at
least $2,000,000 / month, not to mention people buying expansions.  As
I said, the people who are left are pretty hard core.  I don't think
the game is going away anytime soon.
