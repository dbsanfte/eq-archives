hehe - I was killing Gornit yesterday when a 25 iksar shaman got
all the sisters on him.  He kept running in circles around me
yelling for help.

I had to yell several times at him "Hey, Fuutang, I'm not going
to kill your train, I like my faction with the wood elves, just
gate for crying out loud"

finally a shout "OH, I'd forgotten", forgotten what?  to Gate?
