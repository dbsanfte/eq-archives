That is a rather rude statement.  -int may mean nothing to you, but then
being able to have +3 in STR to keep yourself from being encumbered helps
as well.  Given encumberance is what slows you down, even with SoW on.

I guess you missed that part of 'Hunting'.  I use the gauntlets a lot for
manaless snares.  Also, when you are chain casting spells, Throw out the
Root, gauntlets, dot, ES Dot, dot with breath of Ro.  No waiting a second
or two between casting all of that in a solo hunting.  Also, cost wise, es
gauntlets are cheap for hunting, where as you are dropping about 3 to 5k to
get coldain skin gloves.  Also, consider this little tidbit.  ES items,
while sucky in effect, drops 1 spell you have to mem in the 8 gem spell
slots you have available.  So in a raid, where you need to throw out spells
and can't just sit down to remem another spell because that one spell gem
for snare is taking up space for something you need in a middle of a fight,
being able to throw out that snare or manaless dot does help.

I said PRAYER SHAWL... Not Coldain Prayer Shawl.  There is a Prayer Shawl
in the game.

It only dings you in the Cha and Sv Versus Disease.  If you get the Othmir
cap, it doesn't hit you as bad.
