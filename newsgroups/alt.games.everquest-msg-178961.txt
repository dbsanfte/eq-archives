A lot of people don't want to ruin their "Live Froglok" faction for a 
couple reasons.  One is to make it easy to travel through upper guk.  
Another is to complete a new quest for an illusion item.  The illusion item 
is the reason you may see some HIGH level players running around Lower Guk 
killing mobs that they are really too high to get real EXP from.  If you're 
real unlucky, they will be asses and basically grab as much of the frogs in 
dead part of the zone and AOE them to death instead of letting people who 
can benefit from the EXP and loot have them.  Blame Sony for this one.  It 
looks like they may have saved face by adding faction increases with the 
Live Frogs if you kill in Sebilis, though.

The Frogs in Kunark are on a different faction than the ones in Guk.  
Something like "Frogloks of Kunark" *shrug*.  Killing these may even raise 
your Live Frog faction in Guk, too.  I don't know.

Another thing to consider is the new expansion coming out.  If the "town" 
that the new frog race starts in is based off of Guk or Kunark frog 
faction, killing these frogs may either be a bad or good idea.
