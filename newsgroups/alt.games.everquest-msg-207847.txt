Hmm, my mistake, someone once said it was 97% and I never really  
looked, only got the one ever and was too amazed by the expense to pay 
attention to the %.

OK then only the cleric AA rez is a better percent, and I fully expect 
never to recieve one of those... after all, if a cleric is already there 
rezzing, why do they need me on my feet instantly more than anyone else?
