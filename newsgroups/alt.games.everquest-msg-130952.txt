I just upgraded my system from ME to XP and now I am getting disconnected
from the server  about every 20mins or so. As a general rule I never got
disconnected when ME was my operating system. Any ideas?
The OS is the only thing that has changed, no other software has been added
other then the patches for the XP OS and various driver files.

Thanks
Dave
