The 'tri-' part of 'tribunal' does have something to do with the number
three, but it's not as simple as you suggest.

Tribunal in English originally meant the bench on which a judge or other
presiding officer sits in court, and by extension came to mean a
committee or other entity with the power to dispense justice. This bench
meaning is directly from the Latin tribunal, which in turn os from the L
tribunus, an officer or magistrate; originally the chief of a tribe.
Tribus is the L for tribe, and originally meant '*one third* of the
Roman people'. So tribunal means what it does through a somewhat
convoluted chain - the (abstract) bench or sitting place of the
representative of *one third* of the people. It doesn't have to have
*three* people =)
