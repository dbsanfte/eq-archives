I believe the problem here is with Christians who are too lazy to learn 
their own religion.  These are many times the most vocal in trying to 
"preach" to others how the other person's religion is wrong.  Personaly 
I have no problem with someone telling me I'm wrong, but when I come 
back with an argument(in the debate term sense, not the raising my voice 
sense) you better know your stance well enough to come back with a 
reasonably thought out counter-argument.
