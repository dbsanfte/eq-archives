Almost no one lags in the bazaar. There's nothing going on there that
uses high bandwidth unless some bozo is trying to lag out a rival
trader or some bard left their songs on when they go afk.

Many people, however, have a bad framerate there, including most the
people who just called it lag in this thread.

Which is it for you?
