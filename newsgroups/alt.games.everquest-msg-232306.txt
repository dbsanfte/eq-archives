Have not yet done a lot of LDoN, but am unable to shake the feeling that I
am getting hosed on loot...

Had a couple blantants, like a party looter who flat out split and was never
seen again, and an 'accident' when someone picked up the aug I had rolled a
95 to win...

Also seeing some things scroll by in the heat of combat and [will review my
log file to verify this...] pretty sure a couple of augs were not even
mentioned to party.  Not having the whole list memorized and so many items
in game, ahrd to be sure...

Would like to simplify for my next - wondering how people would react to
this scheme [suggested by another to me]:

Rotate, one body per time, establish the order, and then each person, when
their turn comes, loots the next available body.  Autosplit on or off as
party decides, looter has Right to everything, use or not.

Obviously, a player with any degree of class will offer up items to those
who can use them, especially the no drops.

When more than one body down at the end of combat, choice given to next in
rotation...

Would also add an aspect I am dying [literally] to see... just a little
caution, as the time in gathering loot will allow mana regen and reign in
the 'Charge' metality of most tanks I have worked with...

Any idea ...  any thoughts?
