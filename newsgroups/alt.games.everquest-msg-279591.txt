WTF is *that* about?

My Blade of Disruption / Twice Forged Steel Bulwark combination outparses my Edge of
Envelopment by quite a bit.  AND my stats are higher with the 1HS/Shield combo.  I very
rarely equip my EoE.  I'd sell it off but its attuneable. **sigh**

One word: "Bash."

Of course, you could always earn the 2H bash AA, if you're working on AA.  Personally, I'm
happy with my Holy Pony and 100% XP for now.  I'll go back to 100% AA after I ding past
PoP, but until then, dumping a bunch of XP into AAs isn't in the cards.

Best regards,
