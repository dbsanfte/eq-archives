People actually bother to fight light-blue mobs? Pre-patch these were
the mobs that conned green but still gave some exp. My experience is
that these mobs are not worth the time to kill.

Well, I guess we're talking about different things, cause I don't
think the light blue mobs count for anything. I don't bother killing
them when I'm soloing anyway. I still think that even your nicely
twinked monk would have a hard time going toe to toe with a dark blue
50+ mob. Even 40 point regen is not going to counter the big hits
those mobs will be landing. There may be some dark-blue mobs that are
exceptions to this, but in my experience, 50+ meleeists generally do
not solo for exp.
