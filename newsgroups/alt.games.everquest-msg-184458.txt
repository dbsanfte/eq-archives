A while back I created a cleric for 2-boxing for my buddy and
me to use.  I only had the first level evoc spell, gate and a
couple others for the longest time.  Pull with smite and melee
it down while the DS did it's work.  Never even bought armor
for him until 30+, he just wore mage summoned stuff :-P

He didn't level as quick (naturally) but by 30 his Defense/dodge
were capped, as were Offense and 1hb.  All his casting spells
stank though (except evoc) - that's when I got him his wis gear,
got a KEI and set my programmable keypad to autorepeat the 1 key
which had the social

/pause 40, /cast 1
/pause 30, /cast 2
/pause 30, /cast 3
/pause 10, /cast 4
/doablity 1

spell gem one was the 1st level abj. spell (courage?),
2 was minor heal, 3 was true north?  maybe, and 4 was
summon food, ability one was sense heading.

sat back and read a book for the next 2.5 hours, and
most of his skills were near or at max.

It took me about 2 days played to get him to grouping
range with our regular group, and with all his necessary
skills up to snuff.  From then on he just got his xp
(almost 60) by grouping with us.
