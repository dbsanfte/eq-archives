What do you all think of this idea?  Introduce a PvP zone or dungeon in the
game?  It would be like the PvP areas already in game but would be exp.
giving and have multi-leveled MOB's dropping semi-desirable items or plat.
I think it would be kind of fun to try some group PvP if the normal PvE
grind got too dull.

Heck, you could even take the idea further and have each server be related
to a designated PvP sister server.  It could work like this.   Click on the
PoD and you would be transported into this "evil" version of norrath with
all your gear intact.  To return, you could simply click on the "Priestess
of Harmony" and wind up at the SAME point you left from in the "good"
norrath.

food for though....
