*** Highlights ***

- Jardel's Hook Mission:  Long ago, a holy war brewed between the
Redfeather aviaks and the Suncrest goblins. Using a blessed artifact
of the ocean god, Prexus, the Suncrest goblins shaped the tide in the
Buried Sea. The aviaks, fearful of the power the goblins possessed
countered with their own artifact blessed by Karana, the god of
storms, which created monsoons and heavy rain. This era in the Buried
Sea became known as the Time of Storms. Many years after it began, the
war ended abruptly when a powerful siren stole both artifacts and hid
them somewhere in the vast expanse of the Buried Sea. Find out what
happened to these powerful artifacts in a new mission in the Buried
Sea! 

- Ocean of Tears:  The Ocean of Tears has a new look.  Sail over to
check it out and to experience the return of the boats!

- A new integrated web browser has been added to EverQuest.  This web
browser will be accessible from either the help menu or the /petition
command.  From this point forward, all problems related to switching
to an external browser will be eliminated because this browser will
pull up in an in-game window.

- Congratulations to the winners of EverQuest's "The Fabled
Adventurer" Video Contest.  The First Place winner was Quarken of the
Maelin Starpyre server. You can view the winning video on
EQPlayers.station.sony.com.


*** Recently Reported Issues ***

First of all, we want to thank everyone for their assistance with
reporting bugs in the game.  Your effort helps us pinpoint the source
of bugs so that they can be resolved as quickly as possible.  Our main
source of reports on bugs comes from the in-game submitted /bug
reports but we also get verification from /petitions and forum posts.

In order to make sure everyone knows what we are currently aware of
and working on, we will be frequently posting a List of Recently
Reported Issues that have been addressed.  The following is a list of
the Recently Reported issues that have been resolved in this update:

Issue:  Tartons Wheel (A Rod)
Summary:  Players are unable to combine Staff of the Wheel in A
Glowing Chest.  The recipe that players must combine in order to get
the Staff of the Wheel and Star of Eyes, eventually leading to the Ice
Comet spell, is currently not useable. 
Status:  The combine works properly again.

Issue:  Elder Longshadow #4 Trailing Longshadow.
Summary:  Players can port into the instance before completing the
first element of the quest.  The player is ported into the instance
with no way to update element 0 of the task.
Status:  You can no longer enter the instance before you have updated
the first element of the quest.

Issue: Shaman spell 'Protection of Wishka' when scribed becomes
'Wishka's Favor'.
Summary:  Name and description of item do not match the spell that is
scribed from.
Status:  The spell scrolls have been changed to the proper spell name.

Issue:  NPC 'a goblin headmaster' in the 'Ocean of Tears' zone is not
spawning.
Summary:  The Goblin Headmaster is no longer spawning in the Oot zone.
Status:  The Goblin Headmaster is spawning again in the new version of
Ocean of Tears.

Issue:  EQPlayers site not updating character profiles.
Summary:  People are reporting that their character profiles are still
not updating.
Status:  With this update, work will be done on the EQPlayers
database.  The hardware will be upgraded.  We believe that this will
help prevent the database from becoming overloaded which is what was
causing many people not to get updated.  There are some other changes
that they will be making as well in regards to the flow of
information.   Once the upgrade is done and the changes are made we
will be able to track the situation closer to determine exactly what
is causing the problem if it occurs again.

Issue:  Vah Shir Illusion makes Rogues naked.
Summary:  Armor doesn't show up correctly when under illusion.
Status:  The illusion should no longer hide the armor.

- Increased the experience gains in the Dragon Necropolis and Wall of
Slaughter Hot Zones slightly.


*** Future Tradeskill Changes ***

We will be making a change to the cultural armor that will nullify the
usage of all existing drops in the cultural armor and symbol crafting
process.  For the slot 12 raid augments, only the drops for the seals
will be changing, the rest of the drops required for the various steps
of the slot 12 raid augments will be staying the same.  Those of you
who have stockpiles will want to make use of them as best and quickly
as possible, as once the changes go in, the currently existing
cultural recipes will no longer work.

For more detailed information please see the "Upcoming Cultural
Changes" sticky thread in the Artisans Way forum of the official
EverQuest forums.
