It tends not to work that way ime, the difference between a malo(s)
pull and a monk FD pulling tends to be that the former will have a mob
slowed by the time it gets to camp while in the latter case the monk
has to tank for 5-10 seconds (even in the best case) before the mob is
slowed. 

> And, you know the whole harmony resist thing?

Heh, all too well although it doesn't seem to be a big problem in PoP
compared to LDoN. I don't think I've ever seen a tier3 PoP group with
more than one pacify/harmony resist over a 3 hour period. Either the
group figures out ahead of time how to deal with a double pull or you
warn people to get close because you will evac as soon as you get back
to group. 

  Pulling in PoP is just too damn easy to bother with FD, at least
through tier 3 (which is all I've seen). It's one of the things I
dislike most about PoP, the monotony of the constant single pulls.

Ok, maybe I was wrong. ...she does sound clueless. Something doesn't
sound right though, any shaman that doesnt' even have the AAs for
cann5 isn't gonna have equipment either to tank BoT. A few 'love taps'
for 700+ and a shaman with less than 5k hitpoints fully buffed doesn't
last for very long.

Cool, never knew such a BP existed, none of the druids I know are uber
enough to have anything better than ToV. Elemental/time gear?

Unless the shaman was a total idiot, there's nothing other than slow
you cast in that situation to possibly gain agro (cept maybe a heal
but it sounds like you had that covered). Sounds more like a resisted
slow than anything else. There's times during a PoP overpull (usually
with a mob beating on the healer) when you just grit your teeth and
slow on an overpull w/o debuffing first. If you get lucky and it
lands, you saved the healer, if it gets resisted and you get agro you
go down with a smile on your face knowing you did the best you could.
... but once you get into that situation, it certainly isn't the
druid's fault if you die. You roll the dice and sometimes you
win,sometimes you go splat.
