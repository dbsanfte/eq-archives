Pass judgment when you know who you are talking to. You don't know
anything about me or my life or my life experiences, shithead. Your
whole fucking life seems consumed by monitoring this newsgroup and being
a pretentious asshole. I recommend you get out a little and see what the
real world is all about. You've been spending too much time in Norrath,
but I can't imagine that being the reason you have such a big chip on
your shoulder.

I don't want this anger that's burning in me.
It's something from which it's so hard to be free.
But none of the tears that we cry in sorrow or rage
Can make any difference, or turn back the page.
