That would be nice but with the number of quests in the game that
could be a huge undertaking.

?

You can already control the camera to a great degree in EQ. You did
know about holding down the Alt key and using the number key pad right?
And holding down the right mouse button right?
You can control pitch, angle, height and zoom. What else is there?

Only thing I want added is a position lock on cameras 4 and 5 so that
it locks to the character facing instead of a floating fixed position.
