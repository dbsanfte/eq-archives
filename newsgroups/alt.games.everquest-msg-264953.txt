One of the last things I did in game (my account was reinstated for
the 5 year celebration, I played for 2 weeks till the new engine went
in) was get that staff for my fiance's monk. After getting a taste for
the skeletons, I got toys for a bunch of my alts, and leveled a gnome
sk from 3 to 7 or so by killing the tiniest skeletons and having them
kill her at intervals. Was the most fun I'd had in game in a long long
time :)
I don't miss the high end blah, but these days I find myself really
wishing I could be fiddling with half a dozen or so lowbies rather
than writing half a dozen or so papers.
