    It is. But it's also one of the more common level 60 cleric spells,
judging by the "who needs what spells" list my guild has. It certainly
doesn't make sense to introduce a new spell that is already inferior to an
older spell, vendor or not.

    And as an addendum: on Test the mana cost of this spell just dropped
down to 975 MANA. Still doesn't compete with WoR for a cleric, but it would
be very interesting to see druids test it out at that mana cost.
