I have started and iksar shaman and i have leveled him from 1 to 5 by
staying in first downhill section in the field of bone, and some of
the scorpions there have given me 3gold and some change, i thought
that it was good loot.

In halas i have never even auctioned anything, feels stupid to auction
something for a ridiculus price, but one could always ask for price
info, a nice trading place seems to be eastern commonlands, the first
time there gave me a chock, the auction messages more or less
scrolls by all the time, and many of the prices are so high i can only
laugh, this is on the luclin server by the way, maybe it is different
on the others.
