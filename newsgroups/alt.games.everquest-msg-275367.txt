Several guildmates seem to have the same problem as I do. 
Stuttering graphics, big lag, etc. As several here have 
said, some with much lesser machines have no problems at all 
and this appears to be the general case within the guild as 
well. The only common denominator I can see so far, is that 
it's the high end machines with this symptom. I thought 
maybe it was nVIDIA drivers, but a few ATI people have it as 
well. I remember some lag issues after OoW went live which 
disappeared within a few patches. Hope the same happens with 
this expansion. As for the cause, who knows, it is only an 
issue in EQ1, no other games or programs show any problems 
at all. I reloaded both the drivers (66.93) and DirectX 
9.0c, but no joy.

Time to take the kids skating :-)
