Just use some of the common abbreviations.. by the time people are looking
for teleports, they know what WC, NK, and BB are. Or, just leave out the
destinations entirely, or list the ones you can't go to (whatever those may
be). I like the ones that say something like "Dinke's Taxi Service now
leaving for WC and NK, 10pp a head" or whatever.

Your best bet is to go to places where people always are looking for ports,
and keep an eye out. I'd suggest Dreadlands is a good place. I've seen
people offering 100pp for a teleport out of that place. Sometimes I really
wish my monk could port, just so I wouldn't have to listen to people spam
the zone for an hour! :-)
