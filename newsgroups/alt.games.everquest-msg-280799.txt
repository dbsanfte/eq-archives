Nothing wrong with Kunark or Velious,I dont see how these expansions
made the run from FP to Qeynos less challenging,and the run to Western
Wastes is still somewhat challenging today if you have no porter.
The trip to Kunark comes to my mind,very time consuming to go there
and reaching the hunting grounds was a challenge too especially for
"good" races.I cant count the times I was killed on the run from FV to
LOIO by those through invis looking spiders with my Druid.

Well,Luclin,this is a double edged sword,this was the first expansion
when SOE took over the game from Verant,throwing balance
considerations over board and just loooking to squeeze some cents
more out of the pockets of the players,e.g. introducing the Beastlord
class.
Who did not want a Shammy with a real pet and (mini) Kei?
(Just came from a fun raid in Ssra,27 players,no Shammy,'nuf said)
While the game still was growing one can wonder how many annoyed
Shamans left the game,seeing their years long efforts being made
obsolet.
The Bazaar brought me back,main reason was I hated to deal
personally with all those greedy assholes in EC Tunnels or GFay.
I think introducing an easier transport system was necessary too,
doing the Antonica - Kunark trip for the umpthiest time can begin to
bore the players,this is one of the few cases where they did the
balancing right and didnt go too far,I remember using the porter
to GD for the 1st time with my 35 monk and got killed fast,hey this
made a nice corpse recovery with potential severe xp loss.  =)
The Kunark spires too arent located in a very friendly and not 
dangerous spot,depending on player level.

Totally agree here,give Druids,Wizards (teleporting) and
Necroes(corpse summoning) their class skills back.

>Make the game hard again.  Bring back the original game.

I would say make it harder,at Kunark times it was too hard.

One problem you didnt mention was overcrowding,of course
everyone wanted the best reward with the least necessary effort,
which leads to finding nice places camped 24h a day,for example
the haste items in Lower Guk and Velk's.
Only solution I see here is some kind of instancing.

So my vote would go to an EQ consisting of original EQ,Kunark,
Veliuos,Luclin and some kind of Ldon.
