It is a crummy interface, rebuild that and 75% of my annoyances with the 
game would be gone. Like snapping off hotkeys (all hotkeys are ctrl or 
alt something) and having nothing happen because I didn't hold it long 
enough for the interface to decide I really meant it.

I have a friend that plays FFXI and he barely touches the keyboard. He 
moves with the mouse, click targets, goes through his menus with it, 
etc. Me I can't stand it that way.

In EQ I just used the mouse for looking around and occasionally click 
targeting (Was an enchanter, had to be done from time to time). Same 
thing for SWG. WoW beta.

Wish and Guildwars did a lot of mousing. Elemental Saga too. UO as well.

Jumpgate:TRI was a Joystick game, keyboard for the functions.

Earth and Beyond I played for about a week. It used mouse heavily.

Generally, I prefer the keyboard. It's a much more 'solid' interface 
device.

Now if they'd use the iFeel part of my mouse... I don't have enough 
force feedback in my life ^_^
