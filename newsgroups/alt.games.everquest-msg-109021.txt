They were actually in the hub, by the West door. I was told that many 
times guilds train mobs there on purpose, to stop smaller guilds getting 
into the West Wing. I was warned not to open the East door.

As it happens, I joined the raid in the HoT for a few minutes while the 
SK who summoned my corpse was pulling, and got to eat quite a few AoEs. 
Naked and unbuffed, no less. =)

Eventually, one of their click-stickers came around and took care of my 
corpse, and became the recipient of a stack of peridots. All in all, 
between that and the coffin, the whole adventure cost me around 500pp, 
which I consider cheap, for the Sontalak screenshots alone.
