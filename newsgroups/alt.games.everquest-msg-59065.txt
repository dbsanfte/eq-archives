Well, one reason is that the no-exp Revive costs 300 mana vs. 500 for
the level 39 rez, 700 for the level 49 rez, and 600 for the level 56.
There are several places where you use the no-exp rez to move people
around, the classic example being Plane of Air (Sky).  
It works like this.  You need to get to get to a higher island than
the one you're on, either because you have more than 24 people in the
zone (only enough stuff for 24 keys drops until respawn, which is 8-24
hours), you came late, or some idiot bard talked to the questgiver and
he despawned before everyone is to the next island.  You attack a mob
and die, hopefully in one or two hits for maximum style points.  You
appear at your bind point nekkid and confused.  A cleric casts an exp
rez on your corpse.  You loot it but leave an item or two on it (I
alwasy carry turmoil warts from Fear in my ammo slot for this).
Cleric invites you into his group, which also has a necro in it.
Necro is on the island you want to be on.  Necro summons your corpse
up to the new island.  Cleric on new island gives you no-exp rez to
bring you to your corpse.  People do get confused, and I've seen
several guildies click accept on the wrong rez when we were learning
the ropes.  Once you have enough epic clerics it's not such an issue,
but not many guilds can keep an epic cleric camped on isle 1.  (Now
that all our epic clerics are active again, we can't either.)
