Refers to a bard weapon quest that has never existed.  Lambent armor
quest giver no longer mentions unobtainable weapon.

Think it's a foraged item for brewing, but may be for tailoring or
maybe smithing.

Refers to certain zones having special mobs loaded for Halloween.  I
know Rathe Mtns, I heard rumors of others, but since I didn't see it
