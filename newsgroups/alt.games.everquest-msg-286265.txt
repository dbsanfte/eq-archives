I suspect latency may be at work there, or maybe its restarts.  At any 
rate, four for the most part is still a very viable  bard; the best can 
lay down five some of the time.... but most I observed seemed to have a 
hard time with three!

Five is a matter of very tight timing, plus picking the right songs, 
some last slightly longer than others.  Its been a while, I probably 
couldn't do it now on a bet, but I seem to recall in particular that I 
could average 4 and a half chants for a half hour straight; course 
there's no juggling, just running in a circle and following the rythm

Latency destroys any chance of that, of course.

I thought of it only because I was experimenting with twists as I 
leveled up, 1, 1 2, 1 2 3, and so on... it occurred to me that although 
the system wasn't successful at a 5 twist it was willing to try, and I 
wondered about 6. And from there, well, the 29 twist was obvious!

Yep, perfectly comfortable, and in fact its handy because you don't have 
to build a separate stopsong button

I only tried this once and in a secure environment, no mobs near me just 
standing and singing.  Was the potion you drank insta or did it have a 
cast duration?  More testing is in order.
