	D&D was based on many sources.  LoTR is only the most visible because it
has the greatest cultural recognition.  But other works, such as Leiber's
Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser, Howard's (et al) Conan, Vance's "The Dying Earth",
de Camp/Pratt's Harold Shea, and even Burroghs John Carter of Mars, had just
as much influence.  (The original grey-box D&D had stats for Martians!)

|But my qestion is...How do you take your EQ?

	Doesn't parse.

|If you are Gary Gygax (the inventor of  D&D)

	Co-inventor...Dave Arneson helped. :-)

	Actually I think he'd be like a kid with a new toy if he saw EQ, or even
D&D.
