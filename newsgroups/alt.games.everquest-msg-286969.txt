I have been given Vanguard as a present and was wondering if it is worth 
playing. I have been playing everquest for a number of years and have been 
enjoying it but lately have felt like i need a rest from it. so i was 
wondering if i should give Vanguard a go and if anyone could tell me 
something about it.
