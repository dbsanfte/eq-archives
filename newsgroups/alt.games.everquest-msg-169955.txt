And only no drop soulbound keys and some no rent dungeon keys
go on the ring.

List of keys I know go on the key ring for sure:

Skyshrine
Old Sebilis


Keys that don't go on the ring:

The Hole
Paineel
Befallen


Can anyone add any others? Maybe we can get a full
list and some one can send it to Alakhazam's or something for
reference.
