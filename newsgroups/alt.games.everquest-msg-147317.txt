> Hi, is there a possibility to change a guildname?

POSSIBLE?  Certainly.  Any actual GM can do it.

WILL they?  Probably not.  Oh, they'd probably fix a misspelling or obvious
grammar error but if you simply don't like the name anymore you're likely
screwed unless the GM's in a really good mood.

Of course, if you point out to them that the name actually violates TOS in
some way they might consider it as well.  On my old server 3 years ago there
was a guild called "Muppets From Hell."  Apparently (guessing) the GMs
decided they didn't want to get sued by Kermit and forced them to change it.
I THINK I heard that the GMs wouldn't let them be simply "MFH," so they
chose "Emef Aitch" instead.

Although the details are undoubtedly wrong (and I'm sure an old MFH member
will correct me) I think I've made my point.
