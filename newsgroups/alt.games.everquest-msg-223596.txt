The test server is where I look for things like broken quests to be
resolved.  The test server is where I look for things like new spells and
new zones to be put in and optimized.  That's just about all I think I can
really expect from the test server.  For those of us who don't play on
Stormhammer, I think of that server as a bona fide test server ... stuff
gets tried out there and issues are resolved before it gets disseminated to
the masses (i.e., me).

Here's a prime example of things that don't appear to be hardware related,
but may be.  Since the last patch, we've had access to the "Con Targetting
Ring".  I can see it on my desktop, yet not on my laptop.  My laptop is far
more powerful than my desktop (faster processor, more RAM, better video
setup), and it's less than a month old.

Now, do I expect them to have a HP Pavillion ze5300 on their campus to use
for testing?  No, I don't.  That's the sort of thing that you have to put
out to the user, hear about on a trouble ticket a user opened as a bug
report, and fix after the fact.  There's simply no way to have tested
everything on everything when you don't control every machine in your
environment.

There's always room for improvement, granted.  And it has gotten better
since I started playing in 2001.  But it's one thing to improve customer
service in a 50 machine office and another to do it worldwide.  Large steps
appear to cover less distance in gymnasium than they do in a bathroom.

I'm not saying they're perfect by any stretch of the imagination.  But I
guess working in a similar environment I'm more willing to cut 'em some
slack so long as improvement is being made.

Conversely, since I work in the environment, I'm less willing to tolerate
stupidity.  Programmer's bravado ... everyone else who writes code is an
idiot if they don't do it your way. ;-)
