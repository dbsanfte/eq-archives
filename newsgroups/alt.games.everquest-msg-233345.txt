Here's my response to the whiny jerks.

"Welcome to my no rez-for-joo list. Go ahead and whine. You want a rez 
as a guaranteed right- you should play a cleric."

It's as simple as that. No one has a guaranteed rez, except clerics and 
pallys, and high level necros. Don't expect one. Suck it up and deal.

And to the new kid on the block, a 'dot is a short form of peridot- the 
component that most high end cleric buffs need to cast spells.
