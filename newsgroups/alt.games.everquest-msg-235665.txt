So you post in a newsgroup where you get paid nothing, versus working
at McWhoppers where you get $6 an hour. Boring work but at least you
get a few bucks, and maybe you can sneak a french fry or two.

Unemployment pays almost nothing. I barely get $200/week from it when
I was on it, and I was maxed out. It was better than a kick in the
butt, but it might as well been one.

I hate hearing people bitch about things that can't control, who are
unemployed saying they cant work a job cause it wont pay, but yet they
eran ZERO bucks complaining. Ya know what the Hindi are going to eat
us for lunch if we all sit around and whine how we can't find work.

EQ has one rule applicable in RL. If you can't find a group, make one!

I have all the sympathy for folk who are unemployed, I have zero
sympathy for people who wait for a job to fall out of the sky. There
are too many people who are looking for work who hustle and don't find
it, and ya know I would be happy to buy them a plate of wings and a
beer. I can think of one person who may be reading this news group
now, who was unemployed and found a job.
