I've noticed that I have to target myself before drinking a SOW potion,
else I get a message telling me to pick a target first.  It occurred to
me to wonder, can I select someone else and give them SOW by drinking a
potion?  That seems like an odd way for a potion to work, but why else
am I required to pick a target?

It would certainly be simpler than handing a potion around (not to
mention safer, if there's any chance the other person wouldn't give
it back).

I looked around a bit and didn't see anything to confirm or deny that
this works.  Does anyone happen to know, or will I have to blow a dose
on the experiment sometime?
