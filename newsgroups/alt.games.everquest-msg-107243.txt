Make up your mind, was what she did wrong or is there a but that somehow
makes it right?  It makes no matter how much you want something, how
hard that something is to come by, taking it from someone else is low.  

I was a few seconds behind some nice 30ish folks who snagged Grimrot. 
Being more than 20 lvls over them and possessing Atone Grim was mine for
the taking.  The spawn is a pain for a very valuable quest item so using
the reasoning you posted they should have understood when I KSed them

fight was done that with neither cleric nor pally in their group Grim's
drop would best be carried off by me.  When they agreed a bounty of
buffs fell upon them and we all went our separate ways pleased with the
goings on.  Maybe if this player had taken the time to be polite and
respect MF and his group everyone could have walked away happy here as
well.  Better to do without than to gain by trampling others.
