Well that just dosent make sense. The druid should be able to go out into
the wilderness, stick his hairy foot in the soil , carve a nice face in a
tree and forever more be able to port there untill someone cuts down his
tree :) Its the wizards who have to understand the process that have to
build these great monoliths. They dropped the ball again, druids should be
able to port anywhere that is a natural enviroment. Nexus would be stupid
but nothing at all wrong with dawnshroud and hollowshade.

On the other hand the reason why is clear. They hate druids, and I mean
alot. Druids hit their high point at about lvl 30 and went downhill fast
after that . The reason being is that they dont handle generalists well they
can only handle prima donnas. They have to keep adding to the abilities of
the semis and the generalist casters time and time again and still no one
wants them .The skill system in rolemaster, gurps, or even Daoc is far
closer to how things should work. You can get a 100% skill in one thing or a
80% skill in 2 or a 70% skill in 3.

Paladins should be 80% of a warrior and 60% of a cleric. Druids should be
70% a cleric and 70% a wizard. Bards should be a 70% warrior 70% enchanter
and so on. Right now of course a druid at 60 is oh 50% a wizard and 30% a
cleric.
