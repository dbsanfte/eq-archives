    No, he's saying that they don't know the pulls like he does, so he's the
one that does the pulling. A better question for you to ask would be, "Why
do they send you out in a new pulling situation if other classes do it
better?" I imagine the answer to that would have something to do with
pulling experience and ability to learn new situations, but I don't think
Martin could totally justify it.

    Dependence on charged items is bad, because it leads to lazy habits.
"Oh, one charge of snare here will make things go faster" leads to "guild's
getting antsy, better use snare and speed this up" leads to "crap, need more
guild bank money to get snare pods so I can pull!" If you want to be able to
pull area X consistently, you need to practice pulling it without snare and
not just learn to pull it without snare.
