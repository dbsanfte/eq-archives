Those are my favorite kinds of play sessions.  You get in a good group,
everyone has fun, no pressure to do anything, and the exp flows like water.

I was at Chef in Sebilis on Saturday.  Great group, everyone knew what to
do, and I got over half a bubble at 56.  We even had one time where three
people (including the cleric) went LD in mid-battle, but we survived.  I had
to keep two frogs mezzed for a few minutes, but we lived.  Fun time.
