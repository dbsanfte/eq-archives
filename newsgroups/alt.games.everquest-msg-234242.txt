It's all a matter of point of view.  It's a real deal for 20pp.  As a 
lowbie paladin, I'd think anything up to 200ish was a fair price for it, 
based on stats.

Its real failing is being way way waaay too common, as the single most 
frequent loot drop for people exping at the zonein to CoD.  Sort of like 
that 2HS from PoJ... umm... Weighty Polearm.  Still, not being absolutely 
top of the line for droppable loot, it's a poor measure for mudflation.  
Minotaur Battle Axes sure haven't gone up since Kunark came out. :)
