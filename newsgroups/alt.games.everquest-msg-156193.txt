I'm not sure that's the point.  I mean, if 20 hours a week is supposed
to be considered frightening, it'd be even moreso if it turns out that
that's a "casual" player's allotment.

I didn't see the show actually, but I have my doubts that they
actually compared that to studies showing on what people spend their
weekly leisure time.  You know, to put that in context and all that.

I bet if you compared it to the average American's television viewing
time over the course of a week, especially for the demographic that
generally plays EQ, it wouldn't seem so outrageous. Hell, TV viewing
probably dwarfs EQ playing.

Or net surfing, or hanging out at the mall, or whatever.
