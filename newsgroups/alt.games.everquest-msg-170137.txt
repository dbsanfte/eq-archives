IMO theres no difference between any of the top guilds past the big
three. I have seen people put Harmonium in the same breath as LoS and
Afterlife and the others just below FoH. Times of serverwide firsts
vary because priorities or situations are slightly different; for
example Harm had that shakeup many many months ago. Doesn't reflect on
them at all now, but did alter priorities for a while back then.

These things change, too. Harm was a weak third before Povar split
into Xev, and indeed are on Xev to get away from the guilds that were
ahead of them much like CiH.

When it comes to uberguilds, other than the ones at the very top they
all follow a pretty similar pattern, IMO - a solid core of varying
sizes (but typically less than a dozen) of the really good people, and
then the rank and file of the guild, a much larger group, who are no
better than anyone else on the server and in some cases may be
significantly worse - though generally the members of this group are
rarely aware that they're nothing special beyond their guild tag.
People who, for example, don't think to wonder what the 30 people of a
high end guild are doing in WW *before* they decide to train Sontalak
to ToV....
