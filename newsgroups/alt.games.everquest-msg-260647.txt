Ok, I need a new monitor, and I can't speld a lot.  Guess what?  I still
want a big monitor!  Right, so suggestions?  I have, in my computer room, 6
computers set up.  They all have crappy monitors and crappy hardware,
ranging from p3 500's to amd xp 2500's.. my good computer, though, is the
one I need to get a new monitor for.  amd xp 3200, gig of ultra low latency
twinx corsair duel 3200 ram, ati radeon 9700pro, sb audigyzs2... and a
compaq 17" display from like 1997 that has horrible color quaility.  So you
see my problem?  Wasting some nice specs all because the display isn't too
good.  So, I'm looking for 19" or bigger (would rather 21) flat screen (not
necessarily flat panel), very good for gaming.  It can take digital input
from the radeon 9700 if needed. Here's the catch..I want to spend under 250.
Suggestions?  I'd like testomonials of some of the monitors you guys are
using :)
