Until you reach the badass at the end of the assassinate mission and the 
group wipes because suddenly the mob is doing 4x+ as much damage, and 
has the hitpoints to stay standing long enough for it to be problem, 
(and then he enrages and half the group is half asleep from the previous 
hour of mob munching that they aren't even aware it happens until its 
far too late...)

LDoNs are a poor example, because 99% of the mobs are pretty much the 
same. And if you are doing a collect or slaughter, then yeah, enough 
dps, and the mobs die in the amount of time it would take to land a 
slow, so why bother.

Not all of Everquest is like that though. Thank god.

This group has marginal cc, no real aggro control, and one bad pull with 
multiple casters will blow them to hell. If you are in a place where you 
can reliably expect to single pull melee mobs until the cows come in 
sure... but again:

Not all of everquest is like that though.

Especially not the interesting parts ;)
