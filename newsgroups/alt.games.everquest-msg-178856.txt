From what I could remember, certain Bard Haste songs CAN stack with
any one haste item, and Enchanter/or Shaman (not both) Hastes.
However, you also have songs that do not stack with haste buffs but
will with other items. You have two types of Haste songs. Check the
Eqdiva website. Secondly, ages ago instruments will not amplify haste
in your songs (they all have set values) but they will for other
effects I believe. I'm not sure if that has been fixed yet.
