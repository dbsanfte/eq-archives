Well, Othmir are generally well respected, but he was claiming pretty much
any wyvern within sight of the Skyshrine tower as "his" camp.  I've never
seen anyone in CS respect any wyverns as a "camp".  Sirens I suppose are
respected also, but I'm pretty sure that's mostly because no one in their
right mind hunts them other than for 6th shawl bits.

And the guy is a fucktard anyways.
