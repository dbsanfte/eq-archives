I seem to remember reading about this and someone saying you could break 
up the blocks into the smaller pieces (used for gate potions, right?).  
Anyone know if it's possible/how to/what skill it uses/when it trivials?  
My brother in law is farming velium atm and keeps finding large blocks, 
and I'm thinking maybe he's leaving it to rot when he should be taking 
it.
