> Where exactly is this warning? Do you have a URL?

All travel related warnings are issued by Department Foreign Affairs and
Trade and travelling without checking out the current issues of your
intended destination is not a smart move.

Australia is still a relatively free country so no, you won't be stopped out
the departures lounge and have warnings stapled to your forehead by any
official, but they are readily availiable for those who take responsibility
for their own person and look.

DFAT travel issues listed at:    http://www.dfat.gov.au/travel/

The DFAT Indonesian travel warning was updated directly after the Bali blast
and I couldn't find the pre 13th version but the current URL is:

http://www.dfat.gov.au/zw-cgi/view/Advice/Indonesia

I had read it about a month ago and it was basically the same with the Bali
specific stuff stripped out. It still advised back then to defer all non
essential travel to Indonesia though. It has been that way since I started
checking when E Timor first became an issue.
