I get the same thing at times too.  Last time I remember trying everything I
could (ducking, jumping, medding with the book, etc.) just to get a gate off
to escape my quadded haters!  DID NOT MOVE AT ALL and casted gate like 10
times.

I finally got gate off after one combination I can't remember.

It seems that the longer I'm logged in and staying in one zone doing
the druid kiting thing, the more spell interrupts I get.  Maybe I'm
just going crazy from being logged in for so long ( a mere 2 hours
that).

Here's a couple examples:
clicking the dd spell button multiple times until the target is
finally within range... the spell interrupts even though I haven't
moved

casting a dd on target, dropping its hp into its snared stop mode...
immediately cast another spell to finish it off, but spell is
interrupted

I started to notice this right after Luclin came out.  That first
night, every single spell  was either interrupted or getting that
you-regain-your-concentration-and-continue-casting message, after I
had been logged on a couple hours.  It hasn't been as drastic since
but is still noticeable to me.

One time I ported out and back in to start anew, and I was back to
normal carefree kiting.

I haven't really noticed this with my mage or cleric but with those
characters I'm not running around so much.  So who knows, maybe my
druid kiting anxiety increases as time goes on and I get twitchy.

Question: do I need to see a psychologist?
