Okay.  This got me thinking.  Every version of Windows since Win98, has
had the ability to use multiple connections to the internet to increase
connection speed.  This got me thinking.  I have cable in a neighborhood
with very few cable modem users, so I have absolutely screaming
bandwidth.  I thought about using dial up in addition, just for a little
extra, but honestly, when I'm getting 150 KB/sec an extra 5KB/sec isn't
going to make that much of a difference.  But what I was wondering, is
if any of the high end gamers use this to ensure there would be no
chance of a linkdeath during a major raid, short of power failure.  (In
which case the person couldn't play anyway.)  Would there be any other
benefits with this?
