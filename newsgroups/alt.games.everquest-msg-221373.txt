I'd say about 1% of your dps...the level ratio on his pet at that level
means that it's missing a lot and if it does hit the mob its about 8
damage...maybe more with summoned weapons.  The idea though is that if he
isn't going to FD pull then he should have had it out anyway if not just to
buy more time on an add or something.  There are times when you don't want a
pet but in an LDoN encounter it shouldn't matter much.
