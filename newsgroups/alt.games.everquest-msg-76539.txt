Nah, as you said its 4 percent to meditate and 4 wis. Really a range
slot item with AC and wis is better for wis casters and one with
AC/wis and resists is far better and you can get it pretty easily with
a baking quest.

There is kind of a lot of hoopla over these plus percentage items at
the moment but I think eventually they will be regarded kinda of like
poor weapons that proc are regarded; the 4 percent to meditate is just
not doing you much good. Now if you have 5 items with plus 4 percent
to meditate and it was accumlative you'd be getting somewhere, however
I really doubt if that is possible or would really be worth losing
better items in those 5 slots.

Its a fun item for the wis until you get better but I'm a bit
surprised real high level people would even want it.
