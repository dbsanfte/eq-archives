Something I meant to add here... at lvl 47, I never see anyone suggest
alpha-looting. The only time I have to face the subject is when
playing one of my low-level alts. If the looting system being used is
alpha when I join a group, I abstain from looting altogether. I'd
rather get 0 loot than go through all that again.

Admittedly, I have the (relative) luxury of not *having* to loot with
my alts (not that my main is rich, far from it). Something I couldn't
afford to do when my main char was working his way through the ranks.

I have fond memories of grouping with twinked chars in my early days.
It was great as they always abstained from looting, leaving us newbies
to collect all those silver pieces! :)

I now know how they felt.
