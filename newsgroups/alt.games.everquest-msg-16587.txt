LOL.  I've seen that happen too.

Also, it seems that in particular zones, people are
*continuously* asking for the /loc of certain landmarks.

After about the twentieth "/ooc What's the loc for XX?"
shout in the same evening, I started replying,
"/auction WTS map of zone, 50p"

Doesn't anyone bother to print maps anymore?  I've
lost count of the number of people on Vox raids who
ask, "where are the pits so I don't fall into them?
How do I get to Vox's chamber from here when the
leader yells 'charge'?"  Folks, if you're going on
a big raid and you're not already familiar with the
zone, PRINT A MAP.  Or at least view one and take
notes of the critical areas, if you don't have
a working printer.
