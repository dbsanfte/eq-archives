[03] Somewhere I Belong
(When this began)
I had nothing to say and I get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(I was confused)
And I let it all out to find
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind
(Inside of me)
But, all that they can see the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I got left to feel
(Nothing to do)
Just stuck hollow and alone
And the fault is my own
And the fault is my own
Chorus:
I want to heal, I want to feel
What I thought was never real
I want to let go of the pain I've felt so long
(Erase all the pain until it's gone)
I want to heal, I want to feel
Like I'm close to something real
I want to find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I Belong

And I've got nothing to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
(I was confused)
Look at everywhere only to find
That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
(So what am I)
What do I have but negativity
Because I can't justify the way everyone is looking at me
(Nothing to lose)
Nothing to gain I'm hollow and alone
And the fault is my own
And the fault is my own

Chorus

I will never know myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel anything else until my wounds are healed
I will never be anything until I break away from me
I will break away
I'll find myself today

Chorus
