I think people are looking for mechanical reasons for decisions that have
little to do with mechanics.

It's entirely possible that for a majority of folks there was/is no single
sentinel event that has caused the current mass exodus.  It could well be
that a few of the more recent events combined to help make the decision to
finally cancel that subscription easier, but ultimately 3 - 5 years is a
helluva long time to do the same thing several nights a week.  Folks are
just ready to do something new.

If that's the case, no summit meeting in the world is going to change that.
