Didn't have to be in a group.  I think the reason it was like this is that 
they hacked it from the killshot getting exp.  Of course if it were never 
killshot=exp, I'm not sure why.

You may very well be right, I didn't start playing until almost 5 months 
after EQ went live, but friends who were playing since the beginning swear 
that originally killshot=exp.
