I agree, but 59 before PoP and 59 after PoP aren't the same thing... I 
spent all my fifties dreading the later levels, and then I got PoP, and 
made 57, 58 and 59 in a weekend. As you say, 60 was ridiculously fast in 
comparison, but 61 goes back to being the horrible slog that 55 and 56 
were, when it takes about 400 solo blue kills to ding a level... And I'm 
talking about Tier I zones in PoP.

After being spoiled by my late fifties, I simply *cannot* go back to the 
odious grind that my mid-fifties were... I haven't so much as logged 
Hanrahan in in about a month now. :-/
