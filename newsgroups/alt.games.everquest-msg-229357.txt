Pacify wasn't nerfed.  It was broken - broken for months.  It started as a
spell of 42-second duration, then somehow had its duration increased to five
minutes.  Finally, SOE got around to fixing that, and now it's back down to
its original, intended 42-second duration.

It's had practically no effect on me, because I never assumed the duration
would ever be longer than 42 seconds.  I never took advantage of the
unintended extended duration because I didn't want to become dependent on
it.  And I knew it would eventually be fixed.  I'm surprised it took them as
long as it did to fix it.

During all my play sessions that I was using Pacification, I always recast
it every half-minute.  I was never sure if the bug was fixed because I never
tried testing it - I always relied on its intended duration.

It's really too bad SOE took as long as they did to fix the Lull line, as
many people did, in fact, become dependent upon it.  I wish they'd fix
things faster; I missed Poofy the cleric pet for a long time.

Anyway, to make a long story short (too late!), Pacify wasn't nerfed.  It
was just fixed to only run as long as the spell description listed.
