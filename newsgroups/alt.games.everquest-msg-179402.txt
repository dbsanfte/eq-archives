Correct me if I'm wrong, but didnt' they remove the no-drop tag from
most, if not all, of the PoP spells? (Granted, they waited until they
got their pound of flesh from the required percentage of the player
base, but that option may be open to you now, as long as your soloing
ass knows *somebody* in the game with PoP who would go fetch them for
you.)
