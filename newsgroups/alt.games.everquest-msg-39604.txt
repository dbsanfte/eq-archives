It's well known that those of us who are to damm lazy to camp the AC for the
jboots quest that they can just buy the damm things in Sol A now.  But i've
heard nasty rumors that those jboots are slower then the quested version.

I know there is a short cast time on them (sucks but can be lived with) but
having them be slower then the quested version would suck beyond words.
Does anyone know for sure if this is true?

TIA for any info.
