Don't even bother with a MA.

Let a Pally take the first AE with DA up. As soon as that first AE has
discharged that's the call for everyone to go in. 

Its all about putting him down fast. Absolutely nothing else matters.
His melee is irrelevant. His AE is absolutely badass, though. There
will be no cheal chain going. Clerics should be taking care of their
own group. So should the minor healers, except L59+ druids, who should
be BLASTING (remember melee range for casters).

Everyone else should be doing their maximum damage in a short time
period as possible, including offensive disciplines.

If he's still alive to hit you with a fourth AE, you've probably lost.
By then the AE will be killing the clerics.
