I have a couple of items with secondary effects. In EQ1 I know that items 
either added the effect such as haste or where right ckickable such as 
armour that wiuld also spell cast.

In Eq2 my character has a Fishbone Earing which has the underwater breathing 
effect. When you scroll on to the icon in inventory anr right click on it 
you get the option to 'use' it. Right clicking seeems to emable the effect.

However I also have an Ancient Slayer's Ring of Agility. This is supposed to 
cast Haste of the Ancient Slayer and increase my attack speed my 3%, How do 
I cast this since right clicking only brings up the options, Examine, 
Un-Equip and Window Settings. There is no USE option. Does it work 
autmatically?

IT seems odd that the FB Earring says casts and yiu acuallly have to click 
the use button where as the ring also says casts...but you are given no 
option?

Any clues
