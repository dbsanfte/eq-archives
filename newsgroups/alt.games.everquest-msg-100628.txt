Expansion content development cost should be covered by the retail
price of the expansion...you didn't think the $30 for Luclin was to
pay for the CD and pretty box, did you?

As far as additional server and bandwidth costs, note that it is not
the absolute server and bandwidth costs that matter, but the per player
server and bandwidth costs.  How does expansion content raise the
per player server and bandwidth costs?

If anything, expansions should tend to lower per player server and
bandwidth costs.  The place to look for the justification of this
price increase (if it is not just a "that's what others charge, so we
can do it to") is in general costs, like rent, electricity, and things
like that.  Electricity in particular has gone up quite a bit over the
last three years in California, hasn't it?
