"Buffbot" refers to a BOT that BUFFS.... bot means script, or ROBOT....

Any other use of the term is incorrect, although it seems some newbies like
yourself have mutated & confused the meaning while in EQ1 to refer to anyone
that's dual boxing. It's a term that existed before EQ1 and it was more
common in older games. In EQ1 the only time it would apply is for someone
running Macroquest / Xylobot / some kind of script (BOT)  that buffs on
command. If someone is dual boxing a warrior and a rogue is its not
appropriate to say they are running a "buff bot". And sorry, it's still not
appropriate if it's a warrior/cleric combo. The correct term is dual boxing,
or just boxing....  Class dismissed.....

As for me selling a 2-boxed pair, huh???? Are you trying to be smart?  (I
don't think it's working). I can only assume you've looked up an old usenet
post where I was asking if my dual box twins still had any value.  They were
never for sale.... Don't make assumptions, it really clashes with the whole
"trying to be smart"  thing you've got going.
