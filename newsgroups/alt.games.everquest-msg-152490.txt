I wonder. Do also leave your stuff at some store and ask them if they can
sell it for you?I'm not including pawn shops here. This is for Ed Jensen and
not Jlmc.

Anyway YOU have to control your OWN stuff. If thats from another account so
be it. Verant is happier. No I dont think it would work like that. The
bazaar is working like a charm. And if you want a 24/7 trader just ask a
friend or guildie to sell the stuff for you.
