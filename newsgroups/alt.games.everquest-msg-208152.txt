Ok,
Big debate in my group last night.
I have a lvl 35 rogue and I asked what I should try building up first.
A guy who said he had a lvl 65 rogue main said to go for STA (gives you more
HP's indirectly) & then HP's after that DEX cause it causes you to Backstab
more, then STR cause it makes you BS for more points.
Others said DEX doesn't come into successful backstab stats, till I put in
AA points for it which means I have to pass lvl 45 till it makes a
difference....

So....
What do others suggest?  What should I work on raising first?
What use is AGI for a Rogue? It it worth increasing?

T.
