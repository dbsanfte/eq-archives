See the same argument could be applied to SoL, but they are adding non
level based exp bonuses. They simply should have sat down and done it
awhile ago instead of just adding levels. And is it the lack of Exp or
the lack of meaningful fights? If thee was a zone that had good loot,
great visuals great mobs with no major bugs and some super neat quests
involving intricately timed and choreographed fights but no real exp
you wouldn't go there? I would have. I like levels because it lets me
new spells but If I can get new stuff without it I sure wouldn't mind.
