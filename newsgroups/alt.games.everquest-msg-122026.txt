Hahaha.

First, they are usually called video cards, and adapter sounds really funny.

But anyway, TNT2 cards are like, four generations ago in the timeline of
video cards.

In other words, yes, you could use an upgrade!

On a minimal budget, I would suggest a low end ATI Radeon or a low-end
GeForce2 (either with at least 64mb of video ram), on a medium budget, maybe
a medium/high end GeForce 3.

If you are going all out, GeForce4 Ti4600 like whut.
