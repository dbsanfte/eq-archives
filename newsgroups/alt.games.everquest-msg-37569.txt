There's not really much to hunt in ocean of tears at level 8. However,
you may at some point want to get off on the Sisters of Erollisi Island
(the stop on the FP-BB boat). They sell kiola nuts there, which are
needed for the Trueshot bow quest - stock up (they don't stack, but
after you convert them into Tumpy tonics in Kaladim, they will).

Although your fletching probably won't be high enough to make the bow,
you can start doing the quest for xp, faction and cash, just as soon as
you are high enough level to gank runaway clockworks in Steamfont
(possible at 8? I can't remember)
