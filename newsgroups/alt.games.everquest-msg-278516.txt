If i had a all station pass, I'd be greatly interested in playing with this. What i regret is the fact that they 
organised things so that at the upper levels (my highest was a 56 druid i think) you could no longer act in the same way 
as in the lower levels and had to group or charm solo (and if i wanted to charm things, i'd be an enchanter!).

I liked playing a twink, and being ridiculously buffed. I liked being healed by a stranger who got nothing directly out 
of it, or buffing someone as I ran past (so long as i wasn't begged for buffed, used to loathe beggars). I think the 
factions could be quite exciting, although i think making them simpler, so that it would be easier for 'evil' races to 
get good faction and not be ganked by that one npc who is on a faction table that can't be improved.

I think Early EQ1 has a lot to offer. Enormous amounts of content. Perhaps that point could be pushed more, in gaming 
magazines and so on? It's the later game where there seemed a lot of crude fudges designed to force you to group that I 
disliked.
