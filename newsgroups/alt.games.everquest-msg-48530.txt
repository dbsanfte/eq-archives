I am currently questing for the 3rd coldain shawl quest. I have my baking
and pottery to sufficient levels and completed the first few recipes. Now I
am hunting Snow Griffins in EW and it will probably take me at least one
more night of hunting to get 4 eggs.

My question is: Do I keep the Seal of Thurgadin when I turn the seal and my
2nd shawl in?
I don't plan to get the 4th or 5th until I'm lvl 49 and I could use that
seal more then I could use the 3rd shawl right now (wearing the 2nd, and the
third is not that much better).
