There was a guild on Bristlebane called Deciples of Terror (I think Deciples
is pronounced like Decibels or at least that's how I always said it) anyway
they were after a new guild name, probably thru constant ribbing of the poor
spelling in their, then, current name but wanted to keep the same acronym
(DoT) and I remember reading how they couldn't have Death in the title as it
was not allowed. That was why I thought that was the case, maybe it was just
the GM's on BB that came up with that.
