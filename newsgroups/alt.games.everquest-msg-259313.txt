As I recall, from seeing data in the past, monks have good avoidance, 
but, a few lucky hits will drop a monk fast.  You will get lucky streaks 
where you avoid almost everything, and unlucky streaks where you get hit 
by almost everything.  It sucks for someone having to heal a monk, and, 
of course, it sucks as the monk because you tend to die a lot more when 
pulling for raids.
