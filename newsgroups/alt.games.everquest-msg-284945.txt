Ditto. It never misses, but is sometimes resisted.  I see the (for me)
blue breath emanating if I am in 3rd person view, but can't remember
if I see it in 1st person mode.  I'll check next time  :)

Actually, I want to go somewhere like Blackburrow, trigger the breath
as I rotate 360 degrees, see how *that* works out  :D
