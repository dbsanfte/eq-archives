Monk dammage per second is ~ 100 Dps at max with uber gear against non high
ac mobs.

A wizard with uber gear has a mana regen of 42 (lvl 65) + 15 (Ft) + 14 (kei)
or around 70 mana every tick or 6 seconds. Lets take an average high level
wizard spell agnars thunder . It does 2305 dammage for 580 mana. After focus
effects and crits it does (2305 x 1.2) x 1.1= 3042 dammage for 540(.8) =432
mana. This is a dammage per mana medded of 7 or so and a sustained dps of
490/6 or 81.

If your group is only fighting 80% of the time waiting for pulls then a
wizard and a monk dps are equal. If you are actively engaged less than 80%
of the time a wizards dps is higher than a monks. Both classes are primarily
usefull as dammage dealers. Wizards can crunch dammage into a small
timeframe . Wizards have greater utility abilities . Wizards are far easier
to solo for experience. Of the dps slots available wizards fall
significantly behind magicains and necros. Monks fall behind rogues who are
suffering from exactly the same problems. Warriors are just screwed since
there primary use is to hold the aggro of a mob and they are incapable of
doing so since taunt is pretty much broken on the high end.

The easiest group to get experience with atm would look like this.

Cleric- heal and buff
Shadowknight- pull and tank
Enchanter, or bard - buff , mana regen , cc
3 high dps classes in prefrence of (magician , necro , shaman ,wizard ,
druid , beastmaster , rogue , monk )
