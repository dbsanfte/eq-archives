I suppose I'm a bit biased but stick with the Halfling, we rock!

You should try to keep 1HS and 2HS maxed, and keep at least one of the
others (1HB, 2HB, Piercing) at a decent level if not maxed;  Archery is also
a valuable skill but I have major trouble getting it up, I wasted an entire
quiver of arrows (7 stacks) hunting and only got 3 points increase on blue
mobs (thanks to some freaky pathing in Xorbb the minos stayed rooted even
when my druid's root wore off and let me pincushion them until they started
running away)

for comparison, I have:
a Blackened alloy bastard sword for 2HS,
a Blackened alloy long sword, Velium battle axe and Polished granite
tomahawk that i swap around for 1HS (PGT proc is AWESOME when I'm soloing)
a Blackjack in the bank that i use occasionally to up my 1HB
Just picked up a Kechata Koro Mis (sp?) to work on my 2HB (low delay for
2HB)
Some fractured femur thing that drops off of some cleric gobbie in new
Runnyeye (NoDrop)
some 1-cam bow (dont look at it that much) and a crap load of "Arrow"s in a
tailored quiver (can't afford better arrows)

Skills are at:
95 (max) for 1HS, 2HS, Dual Wield and Double Attack and the passive
skills(offense, defense, parry - etc.)
47 for 1HB
17 for archery
0 for throwing, piercing and 2HB (yes I know that 2HB is bad, that's why I
got the Kechata Koro Mis)

Armor-wise:
(small) Crafted BP, Leggings and Gloves
Royal Frosted Velium Boots (NoDrop in Icewell keep, scavenged)
Straw-spun belt
Skull-shaped Barbute
2 Jagged bands (5AC +3 str)
2 +3 str earrings
Blackened Iron arm plates ( had small bronze but they made me sick to look
at even though they had 1-2 ac more than BI)
(small) bronze splinted cloak
2 small ringmail bracers (Need to upgrade but I never think about it when in
EC, have EE stalks for crafted bracer quest, but no gem - low Cha makes
vendors rip me off)
Split paw mask (Need to upgrade a bit, but not that important, I like the
lightsouce effect)
(small) bronze gorget

I think thats it on the armor (I can't believe I remembered all that....)
