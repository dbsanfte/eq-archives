Yup the kind that are fat greesy loser 13 year olds that get picked on
in school, so they have to go to a world like EQ or UO and prove their
"toughness" by being dumb fucking retards.

I think every player should be able to access everyone's home address,
so we can go kick their fucking ass when think they are tough.

Better yet, we should all pick a PvP server, develope powerful characters
and enforce the LAW.

Who wants ta join me?!
