haven't you guys hear the rumour that the $3 hike is sony's idea to help pay
for a whole new line of servers to start for a different game? I.e.( Final
Fantasy 11) Square Soft lost a ton of money of the movie Final Fantasy and
ended up losing its major share holders right of its own company to sony in
a bail out. Sony doesn't want to invest more capital on FF11 so they are
looking for a quick money generator. Keep in mind this is only a rumour.
