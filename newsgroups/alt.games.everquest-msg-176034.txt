I really think that a lot of manufacturing, if not most, will be in the form
of PAs ("companies") who have all the necessary players to create what the
want to create.  However I don't think that's bad in and of itself.  That
means that in order to be a successful businessman you have to associate
with other players, which is good IMHO.  By the way -- when you create
something it's unique, you can choose the components and engineer an item
for whatever stats you want, assuming you have the
skill/materials/components to make whatever you design.  You can also put
your name (or the name of your company) on the item, so that if you (or your
company) designs and builds particularly good equipment you'll become known
for it and your products will be particularly sought-after.  That should
make for some interesting dynamics in the game, I'm looking forward to
seeing how well that will work.
