Hi all

Just want to clarify something which I hope others have experienced. I 
have just changed my billing information to a different card. I am right 
in assuming the card will only be active on the next payment day not 
bill me anew from the changed billing details. It wasn't particularly 
clear at the acceptance stage, as opposed to the input stage!

Out of interest the reason I am changing is I have a Premier card I 
noticed the B&*&*&* are charging me an exchange rate of 1.4! Absolutely 
ludicrous, it should be 1.6 so have moved to a card with a better 
exchange rate. It is worth checking

Miles
