You get all the drivers you need with the ATI 9200, (I know, I had to buy
one when DX9 started), but after you install the new card like the
instructions say go to the Sony site and download the drivers they
recommend.  (once again, I know this from xp)

After the new card is installed, you can go to add/remove programs and get
rid of NV.

Mine works great, even better than before when they were running v.9
