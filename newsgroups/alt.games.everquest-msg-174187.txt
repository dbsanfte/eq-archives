Ask the people you kill by sticking to your guns that.

It would be one thing if the US was 100% in the right on this, but
there are a lot of legitimate beefs around the world. I am not talking
about the religious extremist part, but the political interference.

Kill the terrorists. But fix the damn problem too. They finally
figured that out in Northern Ireland; even though they may not be
successful in fixing it, at least they will *try*.

The number is actually quite a bit lower than that now, you know. It
doesn't change your point but you might want to watch out for that in
future messages.

You will have to eventually, or live with terrorism. If you think
anything the US is doing now is cowing the arabs, you are sorely
mistaken. That isn't a culture that can be intimidated.

You can believe whatever you like.
