Clerics and shamans both tend to get hit a *lot* in raiding
environments and have far less hit points than the tanks. For a cleric
to be effective in a CHeal rotation, they need to be able to survive
being summoned and pounded on long enough to DA or have aggro taken
back by a tank. It's amazing how much of a difference 20 or 30 points
of AC can make.
