57th enchanter on Bristlebane.  look at my new website at
http://pages.prodigy.net/wwwkevinww

my current concerns are capital plus, and thinking about getting back to

Recently upgraded my comp to play on the new system luclin system, but will
be delayed for a bit.

I'm currently taking a poll regarding a new gaming system in the year 2020
from now.  if your interested in development, please contact me at this
website.

going to be sponsoring a new gaming system incorporating all others, (all
others), if your interested, please contact me.

regarding it.

if you have old issues with me please contact me, do not direct it on this

Please do not respond to this post, because lots of old issues here with

systems.

life sitting playing games online / boardgames / roleplay games,
imagination, Roleplaying before it was official, etc.
