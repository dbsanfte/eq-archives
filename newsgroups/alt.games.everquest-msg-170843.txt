Did clerics get a better Cheal to counter the "nerf" of giving druids a Cheal
of their own?  No, in fact Cheal got nerfed down to a "mere" 7500 hp (not that
I'd ever Chealed a player for 10,000hp pre pop)

Power ups for other classes do not get countered by power ups for the original
class to keep the status quo

(note I didn't mention the Shaman "Cheal" at all, since I did end up with fast
heals bigger than shaman incomplete)
