 Don't focus on any one weapon skill for a few levels. Makes sure to
train them all if you can. 2hb is important but not important as h2h and
1hb so it's ok to get a couple levels behind but don't go to long. I
also wouldn't bother to spend practice points on them. Just equip a
weapon that uses that skill and go to work.
