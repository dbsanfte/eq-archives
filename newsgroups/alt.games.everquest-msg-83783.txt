Enhance vs Destroy... you sure are going to the extreme.

The folks who don't like the naming rules endlessly rail at those of
us who support those rules, but they are frustrated from the start
because Verant owns the game, and Verant makes the rules, and that's
that. No amount of arguing will ever make the naming rules go away,
but by all means, keep trying - it's amusing as hell to toy with you.
