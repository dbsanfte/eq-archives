Keep in mind that a mage with an add is generally a dead mage.
Getting to 51 is easy.  WAY easy, I had 25 days on my mage 
when I hit 51.  I started him fresh on a new server to group with
RL friends there, so no twinking.  Also I used a lot of time 
doing my focus item quests and helping buddies level.

After 51 it's another story.  Take a single wyvern, down for
3+ minutes.  I'm not sure what a monk can solo at 51, but the
key is *they don't need to* most groups won't turn down a 
monk if they have room at all.  Mage's are another story, 
particularly at 51, as the best pet you have likes to root
runners.  Most melee's don't appreciate being pounded on by
something that should be running away. 

If you're truly interested in soloing as the main focus of your
character - Necro/Druid for pure casters.  SK or Ranger for melee's.
Rangers are good soloer's once they get panic animal, there are
lots of places for them to use it.
