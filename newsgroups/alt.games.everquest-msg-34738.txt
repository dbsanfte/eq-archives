Sounds like an interesting tale. By all means, tell it.

From a functional point of view, however, I rid this newsgroup of
Avenger as far as what *I* had to read was concerned. I put him in my
killfile, and kept him there. Problem solved.

By all means, he's entitled to voice his opinion. But note that I
didn't send someone in here to be my champion after pissing everyone
off - he did. If he's going to act like an ignorant prick, then he'd
damn well better learn to not care when he gets treated accordingly.

You haven't pointed anything out, you've made a claim that has yet to
be proven. And I've long since proven that I'm willing to give second
chances, so no, I'm not experiencing any particular pain. Perhaps you
think I've invested more emotion into my opinion of you than I
actually have.

Ah, so you're notifying us in advance that you will be acting
immaturely. How terribly decent of you, but the warning wasn't really
needed.

In any case, it will depend entirely upon Matt.
