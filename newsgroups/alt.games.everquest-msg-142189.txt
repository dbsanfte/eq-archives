The only difference, in an IC sense, between clerics, druids, and
shamans are the social standards. All three are "called" by their
dieties to serve. All three act as religious leaders for their
dieties. All three are healers, both spiritual and physical, for their
societies. Shamans and Druids are simply more "primative" versions of
Clerics. They tend to take a more aggressive role in their service
without actually being arms masters, which is reflected in their
powers. They sacrifice some healing potential in doing so.

Paladins take the aggressive approach even farther, becoming adept
with the sword, which means they sacrifice even more healing
potential. They do, however, get an instant-cast "lesser" CHeal that
they can use once per game day and costs ZERO mana.
