I'll concede its certainly possible it was a female. Even I'm not 
'convinced', merely 'almost convinced'.

If nothing else, the personally held (possibly incorrect) assumption 
that most people I run into in EQ are male however gets me leaning this 
way in the absence of actual gender cues. And the belligerant behaviour 
seems more 'immature punk' than anything else, to me at least.
