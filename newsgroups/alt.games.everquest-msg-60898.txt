A great many people do not die playing paintball. Just because you fire
"guns" at people does not make it a war simulation. Nobody in a war played
capture the flag with the enemy. Nor did they hoist a cold one with them
when the fighting stopped.

Further, every paintball match I've seen has either been:
a) Silly for the sake of fun, where nobody tried to really "win" (because
it was impossible anyway).
or
b) People in serious competition pitted against opponents of roughly equal
numbers and skill, where knowledge and tactics provide victory.

DAoC provides neither of those things on a reliable basis.

In paintball and the SCA, there are rules in place for the benefit of all
participants to increase the fun value. Do you think you would have fun
sparring against someone wielding a geniune (and very sharp) 15th century
katana when you have your bamboo pole? War has one rule: Be the one
standing.

Hundreds of games have tried it, none have succeeded yet.
