Its the one part of the chanter epic thats a REAL pain to get.  I've seen
chanters quit out of frustration after doing PoF raids day after day for
weeks and weeks

Agroing CT can kill the wraith too.  When he summons all the mobs to his
side to aide him, they can turn on the wraith (including Demis who will DT
him)

Zone into PoF, turn left and hit the zonewall.  Kill any agro that followed,
then move down the wall (away from the firewall).  This is the bunker, and
is pretty safe.

Clear around this area (few mobs around the golden tower), then pull from
the north direction (alongside the firewall).  Pull the graveyard mobs, and
you have now cleared enough mobs to safely do the temple/wraith.
