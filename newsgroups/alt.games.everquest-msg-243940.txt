   Eh, I think the FAQ should mention it because anyone that plays EQ for
any length of time is going to hear about it sooner or later, and might
want to know something about it.  I don't think that it is particularly
desirable to say why SOE put the breaks on it.  And I refuse to put
anything in the FAQ that might encourage people to legally shady things. 
This is why I took out the link to the new Macros site.  If someone really
cares, they can do the research to find it.
