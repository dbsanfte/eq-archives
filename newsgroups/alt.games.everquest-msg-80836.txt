I think what you hgave awy was the spell itself.  What you should have done
was inscribe the spell into your spell book.  You do this by hitting the
spell button clicking on the spell (piece of paper) and with the spell in
hand click on one of the open spots in you spell book.  The only thing you
should have given to the guild person is the welcome letter.  They would
have given you a robe and a little exp at that point.  If you did give them
your frost spell then it's lost.
