Yes, I did oversimplify Boromir's character.  But if I still had to
pick one word to describe his character I'd still go with 'asshole'.

I always got the impression that, and this could just be my own
coloring, Boromir was the spoiled little brother.  And I always felt
that he believed that the throne of Gondor was his, even though he was
only destine to be the Steward of Gondor, not the king.  Had he lived,
and had his little revelation on top of the mountain not happened
(minus the dying horribly part, natch) I think he would have opposed
Aragorn becoming the king.

YMMV, of course.

I agree.  FWIW, I though Sean Bean (I *THINK* that's the actors name,
but I'm too lazy to look it up) nailed the part.  But then again, the
casting for LotR was pretty fucking inspired.
