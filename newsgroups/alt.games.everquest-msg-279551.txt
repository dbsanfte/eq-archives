Actually, just last night my guild decided to do Ragefire 2.0 (for, grr, 
another cleric) and the order was sent out to get to Timorous Deep.  I 
figured the fastest way was to use a Magus to go to North Ro.  I happened to 
be bound inside the Guild Lobby right in front of the Magus.  So I gated. 
However, even though I bound myself facing the Magus, whenever I gate I find 
myself turned almost exactly 180 degrees.  It annoyed me that I had to *turn 
around* to face her and get her to port me.  Even if I simply wanted to 
enter the Guild Hall, I'd have to start by turning around first before 
clicking on the door.  With this new change, I will save perhaps two seconds 
in repositioning myself after a gate.

Okay, not exactly earth-shattering, but still a welcome minor change.  =)
