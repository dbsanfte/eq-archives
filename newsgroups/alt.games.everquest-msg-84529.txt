That is not necessarily the case. I said "It's about having fun, not a way
of life, losers!". If you are one of those who treat EQ as a way of life,
then yes, I called you a loser. Otherwise, you only MIGHT be a loser. I
guess that's up to your peers to decide.

The only thing that is "obvious" is that the rules rely upon very subjective
interpretations of what is "offensive". Why you folks are so obsessed by
ficticious character names is beyond my comprehension. I simply play the
game and enjoy myself while doing so. What someone named their character is
of little concern to me.

I hope you real life perception of the world is a whole lot less rigid.

"Many people know so little about what is beyond their short range of
experience. They look within themselves--and find nothing! Therefore they
conclude that there is nothing outside themselves either".
