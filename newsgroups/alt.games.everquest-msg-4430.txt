I'm going to let out part of the secret invasion plans. As some have
blocked this will give us the opportunity to sit back and laugh when the
real monster gets here.

le seccret plane':

One year prior a certain group of the SOS begins to play EQ. Upon
learning about the EQng SOS members begin to profile the community.

Day 1. Getsum arrives baiting the attack. he calls out the secret
message in the FAng, "the cow is giving milk"

Day 2. Avenger comes in to find getsum being attacked and begins master
plan releasing the secret responce,"the bucket is under the cow"

Day 3. SOS members arrive and proceed to take over in preparation for
the arrival of the monster. The secret message is release,"the bucket is
full"

4/19/01, message sent," the monster is awake". The EQng awaits arrival
of the monster named Brat.

Purely fiction mind you.

Avenger.
