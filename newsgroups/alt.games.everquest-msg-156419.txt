Interested in begging but just wondering what is the most somebody has
gotten.  I see people that get a few PP by begging but there Charisma is
60-70.  My charisma is almost 100.  Any idea what I should expect when I do
get my begging skills up?  Thanks for any info you can give.  I am  a Wood
Elf Bard.  Thanks
J
