}On what basis do you assert that the universe is _not_ the "perfect
}tool for the job"?  

My assertion is that proteins, like, say, the acetylcholine receptor, do 
not seem to -me- to be the perfect tool for the job that they do, ie, 
depolarize a membrane potential in the presence of acetylcholine.  For 
evidence of this, I cite the wide variety of AChR's available in nature, 
or even in the same organism.  If any one of them was perfect for the 
depolarization job, why not use the same model everywhere?  There is some 
reason for variation; in some situations, the receptor should respond to 
different amounts of ACh, or depolarize the membrane at different rates, 
eg, in the electric organ of torpedo marmorata you want it to depolarize 
much faster and with much greater sensitivity than in the human 
neuromuscular junction.  I perceive the variation as being greater than 
this need requires, and I also perceive that the structures at the end 
points are too similar.  I know that sounds contradictory, but it's not.  
The electric organ example and the neuromuscular example are very 
different applications.  If they were designed by a perfect being, I would 
expect very different tools to be used.  But contrariwise, I'd think you 
could get away with the exact same tool in all skeletal muscles in all 
creatures, and the exact same tool in all smooth muscles, etc.  But 
there's wide variation in those categories.

The whole thing just looks cobbled together out of legos to me.  I'd 
expect a 'perfect' creator to actually have a plan, and be more uniform in 
his approach.  

And this rapidly approaches a question of faith.  I believe it because I 
just do.

}For that matter, how about sharing your 'leet
}beta infoz that defines just what "the job" is?

if exists(the_job) then
  exists(CREATOR)=TRUE;
  universe=perfect_tool;  
else
  exists(CREATOR)=undefined;
  zinphandel=imperfect_fool;
endif

}I, for one, would really like to resolve lingering doubts as to whether 
}our existence is fundamental to the Creator's purpose or we're just an 
}unavoidable side-effect.  I mean, the universe is awfully big and our 
}sandbox is so incredibly tiny on that scale.

I do think that intelligent* life is an unavoidable side effect of holding 
a large body at a relatively constant distance from a large energy source 
for a long period of time.
