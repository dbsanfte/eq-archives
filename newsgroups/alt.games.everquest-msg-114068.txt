Since the other people commented on where the spell is, I'll say this: Get a
Greater Lightstone and put it in your inventory... No, don't put it in a
BAG, put it in one of your 8 inventory slots, where you can see it as soon
as you hit "I". This will give you a "hands-free" lightsource. Also, I play
a human and I don't have much trouble seeing indoors/at night. Check your
gamma settings (in game) and I also had alot of luck turning up the Gamma
settings on my video card.
