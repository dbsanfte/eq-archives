Yes, but in my earlier post (snipped at this point, but it's what Faned
was replying to when he said the problem with SoS was it's too slow), I
noted that even using the (2*dmg+bonus)/dly formula, the SoS at 17/28
comes out better than, say, Jade Mace at 9/18 or Zekhas' Katas or Goranga
Spiked Club at 12/23:

	Level 30 (bonus = 1):
		17/28 --> 35/28 = 1.250
		 9/18 --> 19/18 = 1.056
	Level 55 (bonus = 10):
		17/28 --> 44/28 = 1.571
		 9/18 --> 28/18 = 1.556

I do see that, if you one 17/28 weapon and one 9/18, then after about
level 35 you're better off putting the 9/18 in the primary, assuming you
have a reasonable Dual Wield skill so the secondary weapon swings fairly
often.  But it still looks like you'd be better off with two of the 17/28,
assuming they're not Lore.

Your remark about the "2" varying based on ATK probably answers my other
recent post where I asked how average damage is computed.  I knew about
the "2*dmg+bonus" stuff but couldn't figure out where the "2*" came from.
Of course, nobody seems real sure how to compute ATK, let alone exactly
how ATK affects damage, so I guess I'm stuck with the approximation.
