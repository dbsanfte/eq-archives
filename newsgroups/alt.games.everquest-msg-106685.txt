Absolutely hilarious - Watching a druid finally get the mob charmed and 
working, and then hitting the wrong hotkey and gating to bind, at Seb Orb, 
from Permafrost, before the Surefall port.

Druids generally are nasty, ugly, smelly buggers, and such foul beasts 
just aren't pretty enough to charm anything other than dumb animals.  Even 
the dumb animals they charm seem to forget who the boss is pretty 
regularly, and when they don't, there aren't a lot of places with animals 
to charm that you can't kill them more quickly without charm.  
(/ooc Druids can only charm animals, have low CHA, and can quad, why would 
they charm.)

However, if your druid is looking for a good place to practice charming 
and get exp, there are always the bear pits under Vox's Lair.  Nice quiet 
place for high40s-mid50s.
