Dawnshroud has been the place of late, but you're right in that zone where
it's sort of tough finding a clear place. My guess is that quite a few folks
are going to be in the LoY zones for a bit too in those levels. You might be
able to find a group in DL, and, at 35, the xp wouldn't be bad for a change.
Odds are though, that someone higher is going to beat you out for a lot (and
make lousy xp doing it).
