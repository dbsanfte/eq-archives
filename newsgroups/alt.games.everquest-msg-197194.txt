i also have a level 12 chanter and found a very fun solo area to work w her.
btw, i am workin the chanter from scratch (0 twink), profess no specific
knowledge, i am just learning by doing.

in north karana, run along the water toward east karana, and you will see a
group of between five and nine bandits standing there.  they are all dark
blue.  can we say "crowd control practice opportunity?"  it is really fun
there.

here's what i have been toying with. First i lull all but one of the mobs.
no aggro so far if i am lucky.  if one of the mobs is a druid (sometimes is)
that's the one i leave unlulled.  then i charm the remaining mob (and cross
my fingers).  i have it attack one of the others, and i root and slow the
one being attacked.  if charm falls, i stun the former pet, back off,
recharm it, send it back in.  if all hell breaks loose, i AE stun and run
like hell to the NK SK bridge and hope i live.

i have managed to clear the camp several times this way (one time i cleared
NINE mobs).  i have also managed to die several times.  it's difficult to
get them all dead before the repop.

anywho, just a note about something fun i stumbled upon.
