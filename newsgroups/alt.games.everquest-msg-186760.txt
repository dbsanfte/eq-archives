No, you didn't any kind of taxes at all.  I did.  You just made the
assertion that under Clinton, we had a budget surplus.  I pointed out
that the surplus was possible because of lies and that the drop in
revenues was more painful because of the lies.

I explained why an economy built on lies leads to higher employment
for a time.  But it all had to come crashing down.  Beginning in early
2000, the indexes began to crash.  It wasn't long before capital dried
up.  Then companies stopped hiring.  Then they started laying off. 
Then they started going out of business.

Before 2000, the lying of our federal government and of businesses
throughout the US proped up false optimism.  Capital continued to
flow, ultimately leading to more jobs and more income tax revenues for
the US Government.

...firing missiles, killing innocent women and children, and detroying
the infrastructure of a _sovereign nation_ which presented _no threat_
to the US and which Clinton never claimed to be a threat to the US. 
Explain why it is that this is not the act of a 'warmonger' but Bush's
are.

What was the last ally we invaded?

The only thing you know of the matter is that Bush caught the
bastards.  Of course you immediately assume the most convenient thing
to be true.

In any case, you have already adimitted they were breaking their
treaty.  Continuing with the "theoretical design phase" means
developing a nuclear program.

Good for you.  But you just got doen claiming that the world has a
positive view of the US.  Now you claim that much of the world hates
the US, and hated it long before Bush took office.

> Under Clinton the US

Yeah how much support did they give us on Serbia again?

Since Clinton unilaterally attacked nations, just as Bush is
criticized for doing, without consent of the UN, France's attitude
didn't matter.

> britain

Perhaps you missed it but the UK has been supporting us every step of
the way.  Meanwhile Bush has _already_ built a great coalition to
disarm Iraq than Clinton ever did to _unilaterally_ attack Serbia.

Seems funny that when a conservative acts unilaterally he is Satan but
when a liberal acts unilaterally, he is a member of the world
community.

You don't think it has anything to do with France being one of the
most socialist nations in Europe do you?  Nah, their attitudes toward
Bush and Clinton have been based purely on foreign relations, and not
the fact that Bush opposes abortion, pushes for tax cuts, education
reform, and other policies that those French Socialists do love so
very much...

What allies?  Clinton didn't get approval of anyone before attacking
other coutries.  In all likelyhood he would have gotten the same
attitude from France as Bush is getting now.  About the only thing
different in this matter is that the counrty Bush wants to attack is a
_customer_ of France.  It sells oil to and buys weaponry from France. 
France opposes enforcing all of the UN's resolutions for its own
economic interests.  You don't attack those countries that you are
secretly trading with, (apparently in violation of UN resolutions you
will remember).

50 billion (for just one oil contract) is miniscule?

And if we opposed France's invasion of those countries, our motives
would be quite clear wouldn't they?  (Not that this little
rifle-dropping nation would invade anyone, let alone defend their own
country from attack)

Respect is earned.

Good, France is acting like an idiot in Public.

France, Russia, and Germany all have economic interests in seeing
Hussein remain in power.  They do not oppose out of a sense of
humanity, but only for _economic_ self interest.  China and the people
(not government) of Pakistan oppose the US because they hate the US
and will oppose her no matter what she does.

You obviously don't know what PC means.  Look at Hollywood or Tom

That isn't a policy.  It's (supposedly) a result.

Yeah he managed to put those off until we were attacked and lost 3000
innocent lives.

What the hell kind of _policy_ is "faith in the country"?

LOL, it didn't pass, even under a Democrat-controlled Congress.  Thus
the only thing that could have created our strong economy was its
defeat.

You obviosly need to go look up the definition of "policy".  There are
things that Clinton did or encouraged to happen.  Laws passed is the
primary among them.

> Lets contrast this to Bush's tax

In 1982, the US began making massive changes to the US tax code.  We
dropped the top marginal tax rate from 70% down to no higher than
39.5% and as low as 28%.  We raised payroll taxes several times, which
most will agree is a regressive tax.  We cut capital gains taxes,
which creates a less progress tax structure.

Now Bush, Clinton, and Bush Jr. have made minor alterations, some
toward more progressivity, some toward less, but no one has ever come
close to returning us to the unholy, punish-the-hard-working tax codes
that we had in the 1970s.  (Much worse than in the 1960's because
bracket creep had pushed so many people in to that 70% tax bracket).

The result of this 'regressive' approach to taxation?  Over 2 decades
of nearly uninterrupted growth, low unemployment, and high
productivity.  Highly progressive taxes killed our economy and we have
not returned to them for a reason.  The people have been rejecting the
Democrats' attempts to divide the country in to haves and have-nots
for 20 years.

You also credited Clinton with the strong economy.  So try to stay on
point.

The government stopped spending so much money on people who will not
work even though they can, leading to 4 percent unemployment.  The
result was that the 'poor' replaced their welfare checks with
paychecks.  Now if people getting jobs is the same thing to you as a
tax on private business, perhaps I'm wasting my time on you...

> >Maybe it was those spending cuts that Clinton fought against?
> 
> Yet strangely he had balanced budgets and surpluses.

You seem to miss the point.  Clinton didn't just make up his own
budgets.  He had to compromise with Congress.  You want to credit
Clinton with a budget surplus.  Yet it was the Republicans that wanted
to spend _less_ money, and succeeded in controlling Clinton's rapid
growth of social spending that we saw before 1994.  It may be
convenient to credit everything to the party of your choice, but since
the party you don't like was doing things that actually led to
surpluses, you don't have much room to wiggle on this one.
