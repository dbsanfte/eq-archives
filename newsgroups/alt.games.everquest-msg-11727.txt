Rangers are damage dealers but they can't take the damage like warriors.
Their snare, harmony and sow come in handy if a druid isn't around.  Their
ability to track is second to none, though it's rarely necessary to have
better tracking than a druid.

At very high level raids (55+) apparently the only truly desired classes are
warriors, clerics and shaman (well, and enchanter for a couple buffs, then
get lost).  When rangers are being beat on (and they will) clerics have to
spend more mana on healing than they would if it was a warrior being beat on
(clerics get an extremely mana-efficient spell called Complete Healing.  It
takes 10 seconds to cast, which may be 2 seconds too long if it's a ranger
that needs the CH, forcing the cleric to cast much less mana-efficient heal
spells that cast faster).

At lower levels there's not much difference between a warrior and a ranger,
taking everything into consideration.  By the time you get into your 30s,
though, you'd better have a lot of friends.
