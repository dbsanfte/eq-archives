The simplest answer to this is another question.  "What sounds
interesting to you?"  You can work a Fletcher up to 250 without ever
leaving the shop.  Just requires a ton of patience and an unholy
amount of money (mainly after 202), but do you see your Wizard as one
who would spend thier time on fletching?

You stated that you thought of jewelry.  The fact that you need an
enchanter to enchant the metals for you if you want to sell the items
shouldnt be a big deal.  By 36 you should know some.  We tailors need
them to make Vials of Viscous Mana to make Wu's Armor.  Doesnt stop
us?  And one thing I have noticed with the new recipies and such is
how much over lap they are adding to the high end recipies.  Not only
do you need simply one skill, but many.  Or you need friends of such
skills=)  For instance the Acrylia Arrows require a smith of at least
Master Skill (101) to convert the Acrylia Ore into Arrow Shafts and
the Chunks of Condensed Shadow/Ice or Fire into Arrow Heads.  The
actual conversion trivials higher but....

Pick something you like.  And then go from there.  Will it be more
difficult to get metals enchanted?  Sure.  THAT much more?  Of course
not.  I am a Warrior and will eventually take JC to 200 (GM Fletcher
already).  I will need others too=)
