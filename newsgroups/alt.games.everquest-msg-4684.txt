You're right Tracy. What happens is, when somebody speaks their mind in a
way to belittle others, such as Nagzum's insinuations that people who
believed the Luclin information were idiots, backtracking becomes that much
harder. Looking a bit foolish for a mistake is no big deal - or shouldn't
be - but for those who puffed out their chests while doing it, eating their
words becomes an even worse chore.

It's good that you do that ... it's far too easy to get wrapped up in it.
One of the reasons why I read regularly (and have for about two years or so)
but almost never post. Heck, I only made my first post here less than six
months ago. My killfile worked overtime in the process, so I could narrow
down the posts I see to the decent information.

Anyway, I understand Nagzum was just trying to cut down on rumor-mongering.
Unfortunately, he picked the wrong subject and did it in the wrong way. And
pretty much any way he goes now, he loses. Such is the price when you play
that way.
