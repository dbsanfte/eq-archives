Not sure if Verant programmers actually read this newsgroup but its 
worth a shot, they dont read emails but thy might read this.
While its nice to have new features and zones added to the game 
dont you think its time to fix some of the long standing bugs in the 
game?
From what i have heard boats havent worked fully since day 1 and have 
never been adequately fixed.
Same with a lot of merchants.
If the merchant gets attacked and moved from there spawn spot they no 
longer function as merchants,surely the code needed to make them go back 
to there original spot wouldnt be so hard?
I realise some vendors take breaks and go to the pub such Tubal Weaver 
but im thinking of mobs like Tak Whistler in North Karana who never seem 
to be where they should be.
Also its getting rarer to see any GM admins on nowadays who can fix the 
problem.
If anyone else cares to add to this list of long standing and 
frustrating bugs please feel free.
If there is enough of them ill send it to Verant to delete as they do 
with all other mail you send them.
