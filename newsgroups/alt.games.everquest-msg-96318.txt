Should have asked this some time ago..... I get (loot) runes and you
can buy them from vendors. You know the little stone looking thingies.
It says all for who can use them, but I've not a clue as how to. I
kinda thought this was an ingreadeant for a class. What's the story
here? Are some more rare then others, by that I mean some can only be
gotten from NPC drops? If so is there a list somewhere where one can
see what is safe to sell and what you should keep for trade, sale, or
gifts?
