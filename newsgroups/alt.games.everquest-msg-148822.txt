This is the response I got from a GM from Sony...

******************************************************************************************
Greetings:

Thank you for your reply.

Please bear in mind that if backups are available, character restores
are, by all means, granted. If the backups have been purged, they are
irretrievable. Without a file from which to restore, we cannot offer
restorations. We switched over to a new file system in April, but you
are welcome to submit comments or ideas regarding the manner in which
characters are stored to eqfeedback@soe.sony.com.
*****************************************************************************************

What does this mean? Pay up every 3 months or possibly lose characters
you've played for over a year.  All I'm trying to do is get the word
out and hope it helps someone out there who "might" lose all their
characters if the account is inactive for too long (like I did).  

This account was a family members...so I still have my main account to
play from so all is not lost :)

If you flame me as a troll- then this post isn't for you anyway.  It's
for the people that might play EQ off and on like I do.

Cya!
