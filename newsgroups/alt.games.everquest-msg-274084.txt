What is a topposter? :\

Anyone that sells an account is violating the EULA.  If you don't like the
fact that I am selling my account, I don't care for your judgement.  The
fact remains, the account is for sale.  What I believe, from the first flame
post, is that you don't want ebayers playing the account.  This is not about
me, nor my selling the account.  It is about you, and not wanting newbies
playing.  That is not my concern.  If you don't like that, keep it to
yourself.  I will sell the account regardless.  You cannot prevent every
person from buying my account.

Relax, play the game, enjoy the game, and if you see someone using a
character that fits my profiles and that person is acting like a newb, then
treat them like a newb.  Until then, relax.  Life is too short.
