Of course, it also makes sense to recognize that most guilds will
never be raiding guilds. On Torv, there are maybe a dozen raiding
guilds out of more than 10 times that number extant and maybe a
thousand that have come and gone since the server went live. Of all of
those, we have maybe 3 uberguilds (depending on how you define that
term) and only one with the power to do the very end game, like
farming Vex Thal keys and killing Tunare. So, if you're planning on
doing those things, note that there are VERY long odds against the
guild that you've been in since LOIO doing that.

I say this as the GL of the server's #8 guild (inside joke,) currently
aspiring to become the server's second endgame guild without burning
out along the way.
