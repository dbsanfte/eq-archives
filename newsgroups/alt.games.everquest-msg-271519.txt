Getting from the 1-60 range would mean getting 1 level.  Then
you'd be 61.  (you could also be level 0, but thats not possible in EQ, 
so I'll have to assume an assymetrical approach)

Making 500pp per hour getting from 60 to 61 in ten days would be.. 
pathetically slow.

Getting from 1 to 60 in ten days would be pretty good, although doing so 
in ten days played wouldn't be nearly as impressive.  Making 500pp per 
hour would be beyond weird, though, doing precisely the same from 1 to 5 
as say from 41 to 45?  Perhaps he means averaging 500 pp per hour.  I 
don't think that would be at all remarkable, either.

Powerleveling means having a high level come help you level up quick. 
Its not hard, and we actually discuss it quite often here on usenet; 
paying for tips on how to do this would be weird.  Worse, I'm reminded 
of the famous Bugs Bunny episode with the recipe for "back bay bunny 
bourdalez"; "first, catch a rabbit".  Or to paraphrase for the "how to 
powerlevel" guide, "first, get a level 70 character".

Secrets before the game fixes them would be interesting, but inaccurate; 
EQ fixes nothing.  SOE, maybe, although not all that often, mostly they 
fix bugs or decide to nerf the hell out of things that -don't- seem to 
be rules violations.  Secrets like "hunt in Paladul?"  They like that 
stuff, in fact, they've added "hot zones" where there's similarly 
ludicrous exp to be had, deliberately.

None of this addresses the charges that this guys stuff is not only 
unneccessary, poorly advertised and appears to advocate cheating, but 
additionally is outdated, inaccurate, and lame, Nor that he rips off 
people's credit card information for other scams; I have no personal 
knowledge of such things, so I'm just commenting on the spam itself.

Do you have anything with a little less spam?
