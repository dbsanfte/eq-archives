Well, maybe I wrongly inferred it since it sounded like 'if a GM said
that, the GM must be lying', and since I didn't think you were dumb
enough to believe the GM in chat wouldn't actually know that all the
servers were down *at the time* for maintenance, it suggested that you
were questioning the whole statement - I'm seeing imaginary emoticons
that aren't there I guess.

Maybe you *do* believe a chat server GM wouldn't notice *every* server
coming down for maintenance...
