You snipped out the paragraph I was responding to:
------------------------------------------------------
Pally + Pally + Ranger + Enchanter pet + Enchanter Nukes (and occasionally
Enchanter DoT) = low DPS?   /boggle
------------------------------------------------------
Enchanter was listed three times, I responded to him three times.  Its 
not my fault!

Apparently Breathe (the OP) thought that paladins and an enchanter 
(using animation/nuke/dot tactics) should be counted among the high DPS 
part of the group.  I'd list the enchanter as low DPS, and the paladins 
as low DPS, leaving only the ranger.  Where you get that the enchanter 
is "already listed as low DPS" I'm not sure, unless its that I responded 
to each of the sub parts.

Its possible that OP thinks that the low DPS of animation plus nukes 
plus DOTs does add up to high DPS.  I'm not certain they don't, if the 
chanter is permitted to do nothing but hurt the mobs... but in my 
experience I haven't observed them adding up to a lot of hurting no 
matter what they do, Unless they charm something.  Then the bets are 
off, enchanter can be the highest DPS class in that group if he finds a 
good charmable target, because mobs are designed to different standards 
than PCs.
