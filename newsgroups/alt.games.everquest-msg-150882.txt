Several reason:
1.) Over one hour to find a group.
2.)  Once you find a group, find out that it takes another hour to deceided
what/where to hunt.
3.)  Jerk number one want to be the main leader and doesn't know what he is
doing.  So he quits or gets kicked out.
4.)  Somebody gets pissed off because you lagged and didn't seem to help
when need
5.)  Jerk number two doesn't listen to the party when they say they are OOM
(out of mana)
6.)  Jerk number three can't understand why those that are not twinked,
can't take the NPC.
7.)  People coming in and out of group.  6 player down to 4 back to 6 down
to 4 down to 2 back up to 6 players.
8.)  "Got to go sell"  do some solo action on the way.
9.)  I only have a couple of hours to play
10.)  Party gets killed and nobody helps pull the corpse to a safe place.
"I got to log", "didn't see your corpse", I got mine, you should have no
problem", ect....

I know I can think of other reason, but your point is why play a MMORPG by
themselves.  I don't know what server you are on, but I actual get to meet
and enjoy interaction with more people when I solo with my druid.  When I
play with my other characters that need a group, I meet and enjoy the
interaction with only about 70% of the people I meet and then it is only
limited to the group I am in.

I find more fun in soloing, because I can go and do what I want to do.  If I
want to port, I can.  If I want to help a newbie, I can.  If I want to check
out an area, I can.  I don't have to tell a group that "I'm bored, think
I'll run around the zone for a while, let me know when something comes in."
"I think I'll port this guy, you be ok without me for 30 mins."

I think that the game is far more fun when I solo, except when I play with
the one group that has schedule the time we group together (Every Thrusday
at 6pm).  This group has started together and we are now in our high 30s,
and that is the best way to group.  We know each other, and what to expect,
and we can laugh at when me screw up.
