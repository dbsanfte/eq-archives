The mana and HPs will come up acceptably on their own as I grow into
raiding levels. (Frankly, I don't intend to participate in anything but
faction raids until I hit 49 and scribe Ice Comet at a minimum.) My
point was that, even with the gear I have now, I would still be an
effective contributor as a damage dealer on a raid. Could be better, and
will, but it would work. As to Resists, that's the one area where the
magelo shows nothing, but I already have access to a very nice resist
kit, and the resources to grab even more when I need them. (We now have
two jewelers at 250 skill in our guild.)

STR will likely always be an issue for my weak Erudite ass, so unless I
get some incidental STR increases off other gear, I'll likely keep it. 
I'm just not part of the "Max your HP" wizard camp, though there are a
definite sub-set of the posters on Graffe's who are. (Both valid
theories in my book.) But mostly, I figure that if things have gotten to
the point where I'm getting beaten on that badly that an extra fifty
points is the difference between life and death, the encounter has gone
horribly wrong already anyhow.

That certain special necromancer had all the Sol Ro necro quests done
prior to level ten. *grin*. Troll/Dorf did them all for our necros. I
probably should get the mask, but I've sort of developed this quadding
addiction problem, and until they open up that methadone clinic in
Thurgadin, I have a hard time tearing myself away to go questing.

The Ring of Frost is pretty much a tradeoff for my INT ring. Moonstone
slightly better, though not much. Haven't seen the spider ring for sale
yet, though of course Tarre got one for FREE yesterday while she was
mooching crystaline threads off an xp group at LS in Velks. *sigh*. I
wouldn't mind one.

I still have the masochitic joy of snow griffon eggs ahead of me, but
everythign else is done.

Now that's an actually useful suggestion. I'd heard of it, but not
looked into it, nor the stats on the item. May have to set that up.

There is no eight shawl in my future. I am not as hopelessly addicted to
tradeskills and carpal tunnel syndrome as Tiru is. I'm doing 3 and
that's all. And primarily, just for the range slot item.  I prefer stuff
I can get from dropping mobs, thanks.
