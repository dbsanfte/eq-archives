Not difficult to level at all..  All you have to do is go to Paudal,
get in a twink group then watch TV or something.  When you come back,
you'll be a couple levels higher.  They'll be glad to add you for the
15% exp bonus of a full group.  Don't bother trying to contribute
since there's not much you could do anyway.  And you're not missing
out on much in the chat.. They just brag about their mains and their
twink gear.  Kind of reminds me of when I graduated from college and
got a job in Silicon Valley.  There's a bunch of 20 somethings there
driving brand new BMW's and such.  I go out to lunch with them and
they start bragging about how much money they made off stock options
and such.  Then they turn to me and say "where'd you make your money".
"Uh.. I'm still working on it.."    [a long silence]    "I see.."
Needless to say I never got invited out to lunch with them again.
