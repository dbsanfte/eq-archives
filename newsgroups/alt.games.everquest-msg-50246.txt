The point is that you can fairly easily master both skills by level 20
<without> spending the practice points on FD and ID. Whereas, if you
have mend maxed at level 20 without spending practice points...you're
damned patient.

The choices:
A. Max FD and ID (spend points on them)
B. Max FD and ID and Mend (practicing FD/ID and points into mend)

...B takes a bit more work than A, but it's also  much more
beneficial.
