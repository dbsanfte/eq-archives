I have been playing WoW since beta, and 2 days after I started, I 
quit as a guide, 2 weeks in I cancelled the next EQ payment on my 
credit card and havent logged into EQ since the beginning of 
november. I even have an unopened EQ2 that I am not even 
bothering to use [I figure I will give it to someone for 
christmas this winter=)]

OK -

Graphics are not as photoreal as EQ is trying, *but* is very 
detailed anyway. I have lag due to vid card factors, though the 
main cities can be as laggy as bazaar or PoK was when I was still 
playing. I don't get disconnected from the server, and server 
maintenance is dependably every tuesday, and they *generally* 
stick to the posted schedule [if they say 3 hours, it is pretty 
much 3 hours...] and they do occasionally do a server reset, but 
it takes like 15 minutes and other than people logging in, there 
isnt that 3 hour try and try again that I learned to detest from 
EQ.

You can pick from Horde or Alliance, they can not speak to each 
other [language block and no learning the opposites languages] 
mail or trade with each other. The only exception to this is in 
the neutral city of Gadgetzan, there is a combined horde/alliance 
'auction house' Auction house is sort of the answer to bazaar - 
you go in and for a sliding scale of coppers and silvers you can 
post an item up for sale, and you can take bids for it, or post a 
buy immediately price. The auction can be for 4 8 or 24 hours.

Alliance races - Human, Dwarf, Gnome, Night Elf.
Horde Races - Orc, Troll, Tauren [a sort of big bull like race] 
and undead

Classes available:
     * Druid - elf and tauren only
     * Hunter - dwarf, elf, orc, tauren, troll only
     * Mage - gnome, human, troll, undead
     * Paladin - dwarf and human only
     * Priest - dwarf, human, elf, troll, undead
     * Rogue - dwarf, gnome, human, elf, orc, troll, undead
     * Shaman - orc, tauren and troll only
     * Warlock - all races
     * Warrior - all races

Tradeskills are handled differently, you are allowed 2 main skills:
skinning,leatherworking, mining, engineering, blacksmithing, 
tailoring, enchanting

and all the secondary ones:
fishing, first aid, cooking

There are NO fails on combine, and there are skill levels 
invilved. They are color coded [like conning a mob] gray is no 
skill up chance, green - minor chance, yellow possible skillup, 
orange, always skillup, red - unable to do yet. You get many 
recipes when you train, and there are recipes dropepd and 
available for purchase frem vendors.

Quests start at the beginning. Anybody with a quest you can do 
has a yellow ! above the head. When you talk to them, and accept 
a quest it goes into your quest log. When you have finished the 
quest, they will have a yellow ? above their head. It is a grey ? 
if the quest is not complete. Most quests can be soloed or done 
in groups. If more than one of you are grouped and doing a quest, 
MORE THAN 1 QUEST ITEM WILL DROP FOR THE GROUP. No interminible 
camping for a single drop [like Burgurgles crown, if there are 2 
people in group needing it, 2 drop. if all 5 need it, 5 drop.] If 
it is a simple colledt body part [like scorpid tails] then you 
have to kill scorpids til enough drop. The one each is for items 
like medallions, books, 'named' goodies. But the spawn rate is in 
minutes, not hours or days. I think the longest I have waited for 
a respawn on someone was 15 minutes.

You can do quest, you can hunt for profit and tradeskill items, 
you can forrage for tradeskill supplies, you can fish and get 
*items* occasionally=) You can spend an hour a day playing, or 12 
hours a day playing, and you can feel that you have accomplished 
something no matter how long or short a time you play. Most 
groups that are not friend/guild tend to be for the duration of a 
quest, or several quests in a thread. Some people have done 
nothing but solo, and some people go and attack the enemy in 
their lands [PVP is available even on a PVE server]

Any more questions?
