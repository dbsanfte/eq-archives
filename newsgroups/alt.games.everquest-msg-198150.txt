    lucy.fnord.net has the exact spdat listings for all spells, and includes
important info like stacking. Using that list, I get:

Shaman: Blood of Saryrn (320/tick), Breath of Ultor (131/tick) as being the
top PR/DR DoTs available. I'll ignore things like the shaman epic DoT which
conflicts with some NEC DoTs, and for now ignore lesser SHM DoTs which will
stack with the above but may not stack versus NEC DoTs.

Necromancer: Blood of Thule (335/tick, poison), Devouring Darkness (123/tick
snare line), Saryrn's Kiss (200/tick lifetap DoT), Dark Plague (132/tick,
disease), Funeral Pyre of Kelador (261/tick FR), Splurt (variable damage per
tick, goes up with time, averages close to 100/tick IIRC). Necromancers also
have an undead-only DoT which we'll ignore.

    So, given the shaman can stack his DoTs and the necromancer cannot, I
get the following as the "best" lineup:

    NEC casts Splurt, Devouring Darkness, Saryrn's Kiss, and Funeral Pyre
for roughly 684 damage/tick. The shaman casts Blood of Saryrn, Breath of
Ultor, Ancient: Scourge of Nife (254/tick PR), Pox of Bertoxxulous (111/tick
DR), Bane of Nife (214/tick PR), Envenomed Bolt (146/tick PR), Venom of the
Snake (59/tick PR) and Plague (55/tick DR). That would be 1290 damage per
tick. All told, the two of them would be churning out aggro like you would
not believe and a whopping 1974 damage per tick, or 329 DPS. No SHM/NEC
combo would ever, ever do this, of course.

    I could be wrong, but that's what it looks like!
