Heh. Well, the actual rumour I was referring to is on Graffe's web site
(http://graffe.com/skills/attributes/attributes.htm).

Quote:
Intelligence - This increases our mana pool. The higher your intelligence,
the more mana you have to use on casting spells. Note that once your
intelligence hits 200, the ratio for intelligence/mana becomes 1/1. You will
learn skills much quicker with a high intelligence level compared to someone
with low intelligence. Intelligence also reduces the chance of spell
fizzles. Intelligence over 75 reduces fizzle rate by 1% for each point over
75. Minimum is 5%. [from GZ] .

Soo, while you can't start with 75 INT, in theory a starting Erudite wizard
has a lower chance of a fizzle than a human (assuming they have the same
casting skill levels). Maybe.
