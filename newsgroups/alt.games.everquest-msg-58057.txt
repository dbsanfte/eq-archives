Since they normally fill a secondary healer role, they will most
definitely want to have a hot key, announcing to the group who they are
healing, so another healer doesn't waste mana (Personally all the priest
classes should have hot keys like this IMNSHO).  Snare announcements are
useful if grouping with other classes that can snare, such as rangers,
necros, shadowknights.

I have grouped with some people who go overboard and announce everything
they plan on doing.  Several hotkeys are situational too.  If with
another druid you will want to decide/announce which DoT's you might be
casting.  

I don't have to many multi task macro's on my charcters, prefering to do
things the old fashioned way I guess.
