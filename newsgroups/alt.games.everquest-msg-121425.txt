I'm not quite sure you got my point. My point was the reason kids get
a "thrill" out of using profanity is BECAUSE it is treated like such a
bad thing. They're words, nothing more. If everyone would accept that,
the kids wouldn't get anywhere near the same thrill out of using those
particular words.

Seriously, why do you think a kid would chose to say "Shit" instead of
"poop"? Well, "shit" is more shocking. Why is it more shocking?
Because everyone is so fixated on the idea that certain words are
'bad'. Remove that fixation, remove the shock value. Remove the shock
value, remove the "thrill" of using the word.

"Damn" used to be considered shocking language. Now it is commonplace
and pretty much accepted as "normal". TV censors don't even bleep it
anymore. So, what has happened? How often do you hear kids shouting
"Damn!" anymore as opposed to "Shit!" or "Fuck!"? Not bloody often.
