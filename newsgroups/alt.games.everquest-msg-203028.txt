Sorry to cross-post this to two gaming forums, but they are the two =
games I play and needed some help purchasing a new box.

      Looking to pick up a low cost gaming PC, under $1200 or so. Best =
Buy had a couple prospects, both with 512mb ram and a 128mb video card. =
One is a new HP with I think a P4 2.6ghz. Seems like a decent box, had =
usb2 ports up front I think the box was $800. The Alienware was a P4 =
2ghz box for $999 with about the same specs for everything else. I =
remember in the back of my mind that someone once told me AW boxes are =
easily upgradable, is that the case? Is it worth the extra $200 for the =
"slower" box and will this handle most gaming?

      Thanks =20
