    I found my tailored large bags (lq bear pelt, silk cord) to be very
useful for about 40 levels after I made them, not to mention a great gift
for friends in the game :). Still using them on my 52 SK and 20 chanter, and
some of my friends are still using them on their characters. Only two slots
less than a backpack and 10% weight reduction AND they weigh less to start
with. Slightly more useful for casters than classes with more strength
though :)

    On the other hand, I was trying to get skillups by making them and found
this abysmally slow. I have had more success since making cured silk armour
for nobody in particular. Heady kiolas are easy to make, and spider silks
are easier to farm than spiderling silks + bear pelts.

Best of luck :),
James
