Make sure you have the Legacy of Ysheka(?) expansion.  Without it, you get a
few maps, but most zones will still not have them.  If you do have the LoY
expansion, then go to www.mapfiend.net, select the "Download all maps"
option and proceed from there.  Once you've downloaded the zip file, extract
the files to the "maps" directory in your EQ folder and you will have maps
for almost all the zones.
