The leather bp seems to be ultra rare...well, ok, any of the bps seem
to be ultra rare in Kael.  My druid has the only kael-dropped leather
bp I've ever seen drop - now rotting in the bank because I've long
since upgraded past it.  Spent tons of time in Kael, too - enough to
go to ally with CoV, completely ruin CoV faction while killing in WW
and ToV, and then back to ally killing giants in Kael.  Seen a few
leather pants drop, but only after I had no use for them.  Silk and
chain seem to be the most common drops, with a few odd pieces of plate
and leather tossed in there.

For all you just waiting to pounce on this, the above statements are
based on my own observations and nothing else.
