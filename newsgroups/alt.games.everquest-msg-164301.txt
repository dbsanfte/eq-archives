What is just so damn stupid with the monk nerf is that monks where by no
means overpowered pre nerf. Given the choice of warrior, rogue , or monk the
first two almost always got picked over the monk. The only time this wasnt
true was when splitting needed to be done in non coh zones. They frequently
lose out to semis as well when the only consideration is another dammage
dealer.

The nerf itself was drastic , causing monks to take 50% more dammage tanking
then they did before. When you seriously nerf a class that wasnt all that
hot in the first place you are just fucking up that class totally. Similiar
actions would be to decide wizards are not really meant to gate ,shamans
really are not  meant to slow mobs , or that clerics where not really meant
to have buffs.

Presumably they managed to get over the threshold of feedbacks or complaints
and did something without testing AGAIN ! This is what is so damn annoying .
They did not bother to ask the people who know (chanters and clerics for
instance who form groups). They did not bother to get ester to form a group
and beat on that beetle of testing. They just went off halfcocked and once
again proved that they really are as bad as most of us think :( It will
likely be monthes more before they realize how badly they fucked up , and
the 5% of the customers who play monks will have been largely destroyed.
