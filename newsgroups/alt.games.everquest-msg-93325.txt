So far I have learned that women make very bad guild leaders. Especially if
there are other women in the guild. It seems the only crave to be the center
of attention, and if challenged by a Non- Officer female, she is quickly
booted from the guild. The seem to be less serious about the game, and more
concerned about who said what too who, and what is being said about her.
What a waste .

 Yup, online has never changed on this. I am sure that some women just play
to "Play the game" so too speak, but so many just want to be the center of
attention.

 No time for it. I gotta level.

New Guild time
