My policy on that door at the WTOV "ledge" is to never open it unless I'm alone
in the zone.

Someone else, someone inside, will have to open it if they want me in there.
Cause I WON'T open it.

I've opened it a lot, actually, since "everyone but me died" seems to be a
frequent occurance, and also since I am not KOS and bind right outside, an easy
walk in to come rez everyone.

Another iron clad rule.  Never drag a body in ToV.  This is one of those wacky
zones where if someone who is at Ally drags the body of someone who is Ally, the
mobs still go crazy and start killing.  Only way to drag a body safely is to be
successfully FD while you do so.  So unless you happen to be a monk, SK, or
necro, don't drag bodies.

If someone drags a body and the door swings open and the dragons outside come
in... let em kill whoever they want to.  Rez em afterwards, go on with your
lives.  Believe me its easier that way.
