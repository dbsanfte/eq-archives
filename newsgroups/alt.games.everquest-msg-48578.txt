 No such thing on a raid like that. Sure, you might get some from time
to time but don't count on it, just try to stay alive and forget about
getting XP.

 No, they aren't all like that. Pick up raids maybe, but not if
you go with a good guild or an experienced bunch of people. Hint:
If the clerics are mostly purple, it should go well.  8^)

 Most really are like this. I've never been on a bad Hate raid, Fear
yes, quite a few (it just seems to happen), but not Hate.  8^/
