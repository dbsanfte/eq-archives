In our company, where QA and Development are a minor role, they are part 
of IT. In the software development company my friend works at, QA, 
Development, and IT are all seperate departments. IT is solely 
responsible for keeping the computer infastruture running so that the QA 
and Dev people (and all the rest) can work.
