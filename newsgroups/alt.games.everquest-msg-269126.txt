Now I know you're not telling the truth.  There's a difference between
arguing and using outright unbelievable over-the-top "almost all of them"
statements deceitfully, when everyone and their mother knows that a huge
number of the claims of petitions being sent were made while standing over
the corpse of the ancient cyclops, Quillmane, or a hill giant.

Not much has changed, eh DT?
