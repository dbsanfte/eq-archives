Armor:

Can pets wear any sized armor? Can they wear class restricted armor?
(for example can a shammy pet wear large rogue only armor?)

What slots will the pet use armor in?

If I were to make up a whole batch of tattered/ruined armor from bear
hides or what not, will my pet actually use it, and does he get as
much benefit from it as a PC would?

Thanks,

-Chuck. (www.wormspeaker.com)
