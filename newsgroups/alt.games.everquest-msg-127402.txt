You're right.  That wasn't a mosque just a few hundred yards away from my
hotel (the Al Safir, for the record).  And as or the headgear and robes,
you're right.  One of the things that absolutely amazed me about Bahrain,
was the fact that you would see a woman covered completely, talking to a
woman in conservative western dress (arms covered, and closed neck, but
still....)  Same deal with the guys, one wearing a robe, the next, a
collared shirt.  It truely was a matter of choice.  I loved the way respect
for the traditional mixed with freedom, and more contemporary tastes.
