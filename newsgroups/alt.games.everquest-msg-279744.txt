I've been using this quote a lot lately.

"Where it is usually depends on where you start."

I still have a rakusha cloak and mempo of likato in the bank.  With those, I
was undoubtedly "uber".  Combined stats...  AC 16, MR 10, FR 10, ultravision
and 36% haste.  Zero hitpoints.

I'm not as uber now as those made me back then...  for an interesting slice
of EQ history, read the comments on Allakhazams on the Rakusha.  =)
