Iam now level 35 with about 150 wisdom (druid halfling). All
throughout my EQ life, I have found a spot, gotten to know it, and
soloed. Now that I've hit 35 , I cannot find a spot I can handle. I am
currently hunting (more likely being hunted) in Frontier Mts. I just
died there becuase of the adds. Goblin something or other cast all
sorts of spells on me rendering me helpless. Was already low on mana.
And the exit to LOIO is very hard to find. I am upset. Now, I know my
fun is probably not over, but did anyone else having been in this
position feel this way at this level? And what should I do? Grouping
is sometimes an option I guess, but would like to set up somewhere and
do my thing. 
Thank you,
        Linda
