Playing a Dark Elf wizard on Vallon Zek, I had no trouble
getting in to groups. Since being in the "darkies" team. There
are always room for wizards.

Your best bet is to make some friends. Basically ones that
seem to play at the same time as you. That way when you
are all on, you can pick up from the day after.
