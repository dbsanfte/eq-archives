For some reason, my reader isn't putting the quotations in this reply, so
here be my response.

How about you use some common sense?

If you're going to ask someone to take their time to respond to you, then
you should have the very basic courtesy to take your time to actually write
a question.  No, you were not clear enough the first time, and you have no
place whining when people don't feel like trying to use clairvoyance to
figure out what you're asking.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
