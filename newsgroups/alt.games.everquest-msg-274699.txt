Actually, it's really sad, but you actually could.... If you ever go
down south, there are still a few golf courses/country clubs that
don't allow blacks.  Current discrimination laws apply to things such
as employment and lending, AKA things necessary to make a living...
Businesses still have the right to refuse service to whoever they want
to refuse service too.... Of course, if you did put that sort of sign
in you window, the vast majority of potential customers would
(rightly) boycott you, and you would go out of business in a week... 
But still, it unfortunetly would not be illegal
