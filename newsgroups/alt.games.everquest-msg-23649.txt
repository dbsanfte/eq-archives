My question is...  Why would a cleric want to?  When you are ressed, you are
teleported to your corpse with approximately 2 bubbles of health left, no
strength, and no mana, no agility.  Since you'll be barely able to move, I
wouldn't recommend blindly porting ones self back to the very spot in which
they died.

If you're a cleric, it's best to just have your corpse dragged to a safe
place, and your group there on standby to protect you.
