I was responding more to the dumbfuck plan you keep throwing out...  flag
two people a week for the next year and you will be past the trials.

Do try to keep up.

Here, I'll quote it for you again.

Which leads to the split guild, which is a Bad Thing (tm) and causes all
kinds of problems.
(/quote)

If you wish to debate this, feel free.   Your options are either to argue
that it does not split a guild, or that splitting a guild is not a Bad Thing
(tm) and does not cause problems.

Yet another repetition of your uninformed opinion as to what should or
should not be expected from a member by a guild is irrelevant and tiresome.

No, you won't.  You'll continue being an uninformed twit, talking about
issues he does not understand.

As opposed to your views, which are opionanted and uninformed at the same
time.

> Therefore, yeah, I am still skeptical. Blow me.

You're also still a jackass, so why don't you go fuck yourself instead.
