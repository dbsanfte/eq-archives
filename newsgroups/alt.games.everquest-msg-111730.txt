Hi there, my Ranger just hit level 51 and i have noticed i will occasionally
see a never before seen messege that states i did double damage with my bow
attack.

I can't seem to find anyplace that mentions this at all, much less about it
being a Ranger specific ability. Does anyone have any clues to what is
causing me to see this new damage message?

Oh btw, it occurs very frequent on lower cons (greens and lblue) and dont
think i've seen it on a dblue or higher con.

Thanks,

Attakum 51 Ranger - Ayonae Ro
