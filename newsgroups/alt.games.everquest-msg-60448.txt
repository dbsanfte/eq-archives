Just need to know, how bad are the guards that drop this armour...few items
on my Warrior could really do with an increase, can't afford anymore cobalt
and hunting in KC does my faction at the outpost no good at all. Planes
raids have so far been out of my time ranges (generally start as I am about
to sleep) so the arms and legs of Frosted Velium looks like the next best
thing to me.
 I'm sure some of you here have used these guards as a way to gain Kael
faction, what can I expect?
