I dunno Randy.  I've been playing for nearly 4 years and solo
roleplayers are far far rarer than grouped roleplayers in my
experience.  Your (unstated) presumption, that your singular
experience makes David's speculation false is itself obviously
false, as David's 99% does allow for the occasional solo
roleplayer such as yourself.  As you give no other evidence
to support your argument it fails.  David's speculation is
just as possibly true now as it was before you posted.

What's this?  Now you're _interested_ in role play?  I thought you
were saying that you _did_ roleplay in EQ?
/poke

Really now, including yourself, what fraction of the soloers you've
encountered have been actively roleplaying (and no, "sullen teenager
camping static spawns with his dr00d" doesn't count as a role)?
