> What's wrong with posting in HTML?

Whatever was included, it tried making me do a 3.9 MEGABYTE download to read
it.  That's what's wrong with HTML or alternate fonts.  I don't need that
sort of junk across my 56 K modem.



By the way, top posting is frowned on for a very simple reason.  It requires
you to read paragraphs in the following order:


Read me last, to know what the last person thought about something when you
by this point have no idea what he's responding *to*.

Read me just before last, to know what the re-respondent's thought is.
About what?  Maybe you know, maybe you don't.

Read me next, to know what the respondent's thought is.

Read me first, to know what's being talked about.



Most people read Para 1, Para 2, Para 3, NOT Para 3, Para 2, Para1.
