Right.  It's in beta, not released.

Well, my response was that it was (almost certainly) built in
modules and there's no reason to equate not having something
in at the start of beta with the game not being ready for beta
testing.

I have no idea when quests were introduced in EQII, but there
wasn't any reason to have *tradeskill* quests in at the start.  The
quest engine should be able to be certified on adventurer quests
with tradeskill quests simply being more data using the same code.
With a good design all beta would do for tradeskill quests would
be certifying the data - the engine would already be 'proven.'
