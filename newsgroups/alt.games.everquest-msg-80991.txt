Perhaps it's different for mage pets, (never played one myself) but the
damage part *can* be affected by the weapons, at least for my necro
pets. If the damage of the weapon is less than the pet's natural damage,
you'll still do the natural damage. But if you give the pet a weapon
capable of more than the pet's weaponless damage, it goes up as per the
weapon damage. That's why the rusty halbreds (ten damage, gods awful
delay) that the sisters of Erollisi drop are such good pet weapons for
the 12 and 13 level necros.
