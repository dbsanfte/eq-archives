<SNIP>

And you aren't carrying an alterante "smaller" lightsource, in either your 
inventory (NOT backapcks) or hand ??

I know I have this problem with my Erudite NEcromancer, when he holds an 
greater lightstone, or similar in his hands, and has the key to Paineel in 
his inventory, he sheds off less light then he should.

So I always keep my paineel key in a container, so I can use my Greater 
Lightstone to the fullest.
