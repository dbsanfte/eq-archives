Sorry pal, its a scramble, and a bad one at that.

You are trying to dodge the connection between suggesting someone spend 
time in jail and the implication that someone broke a law. You're dodge 
hinges on the fact that occasionally innocent people end up in jail, 
because of mistaken identity, or merely for holding before their trial, 
etc.

While cute and clever it doesn't actually buy you anything. The 
implication is that there *is* a law that was thought to be broken. Your 
little smoke and mirrors about mistaken identities doesn't alter that 
fact.

So why not just say that? instead the silly little scramble for cover. I 
think we can all accept that. 

Although, it -is- sony's forum, why you think they should be punished 
(be it jailed, flogged, hung, or vivisected) because they decided they 
didn't like what some asshat was saying and kicked him out is still a 
mystery.
