Just keeping one buff up that uses power will drain your power
too quickly, so yes.

Because of the power drain, for one.   Because the
combination of all three may be worse than not
using them at all, for another.  And because you need
to react to events, meaning you won't get the full
effect of all of them all the time anyway (unless you
have a very good run with the RNG.)

But a "buff" doesn't counter events that haven't happened.
Think back to the example:  you can "Concentrate" to
counter a slammed door or you can "Concentrate" to
work faster (speed progress) [or maybe it actually
increases durability, depends on the actual buff.]

Say you're using your "Concentrate" to work faster.
THEN someone slams a door -- you can still make
a mistake because of the distraction (but maybe it
wouldn't be as big a mistake as it would be otherwise.)

In game, you still take damage if you don't answer
the event in time.   So you've got to do that anyway.
Using the ability as a "buff" doesn't change that.

Well, in context, I think I said you'd stack buffs where
the combination is better than any one.   That's true,
but it's not true for every combination.   "Stacked"
buffs may be worse than not using them at all -- or
better than any one -- or any combination thereof.
That's the "fun" -- figuring out what each does and
how well they work together.   And which ones to
use in which circumstances at different stages of the
process, etc.

> Do I understand that correctly?

Apparently at a high-level but not at the detail level...
EQ2's tradeskill process is fairly complicated: the
only way to really get a feel for it is to try it out.
But the simple version is:   Each ability has two
roles:  countering events (whack-a-mole) and
furthering either progress or durability at some
cost (power, progress/durability, success rate.)
