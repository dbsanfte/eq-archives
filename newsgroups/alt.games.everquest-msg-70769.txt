The main reason is that often a patch will result in an
upgrade which makes the new client/server software
incompatible with the old client/server software.

So the problem with staggered patches is that people
who had characters on more than one server might find
themselves with client software compatible with one
of the servers they play on, but not another.

Plus, even for people with characters on only one server,
note that the patch program runs before you choose
a server to play on.  How is it to know which server
you're *going* to be running on this session, and thus
whether to patch your client software to the post-patch
version?

It's much simpler to just upgrade everything, and
everybody, at once.
