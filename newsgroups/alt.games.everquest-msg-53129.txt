Completely agree. Twinking a caster is turning out, as I research it, to
be a very different experience than twinking a melee. And twinking a pet
class is yet another level of difference than twinking a wizard or other
non-pet class. There's a number of mid range items that I can get pretty
easily for my baby necro if I make the decision to invest time, money,
and twink him. But aside from a lot of INT items and jewelry, there's
only so much you can do for them. But jboots? Oh yeah, baby. That's the
difference between life and death for a caster when things go south
during a fight. At the early levels, if you're careful, you can almost
*always* avoid fighting anything that can outrun jboots and get far
enough away to gate. (Sorry about that pet, but it was me or you. <g>)
