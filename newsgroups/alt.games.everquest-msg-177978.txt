Karnors - one of the few times I've put up with that place - was there with
mostly friends. Group had a chanter that we didn't know. Over the course of
10 minutes or so, he does nothing and doesn't respond to tells. We finally
boot him from the group, but do keep mobs off of him. About 20 minutes later
we see some movement from him - takes him perhaps a kill or two before he
realizes he isn't grouped anymore and sheepishly sends us a tell.

He was honest about it - we let him back in. I'm happy to say he had no more
sleeping episodes with us that evening.... ;)
