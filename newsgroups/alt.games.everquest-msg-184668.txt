Like a true usenet vet, I won't comment on flames or personal bashes, and
the only reason i am replying your post at all is because you have something
i want. I'm interested in the statistics you have on "top guilds using DKP
systems". Could you post that info here, or can i find it on the fippy facts
board, or link?

Thanks in advance.
