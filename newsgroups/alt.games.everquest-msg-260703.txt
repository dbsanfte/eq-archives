I'm of mixed opinion, though I do agree with the part about being
surprised so many people didn't know about it.  It was what got me
to buy GoD in the first place!  And anyone even considering doing
tradeskills ought to look at eqtraders.com, which discussed these
"quests" in some detail.

Anyway, I did use the quests to jumpstart a few tradeskills,
especially tailoring and smithing.  I also did baking for two of
my characters, but by the time my third needed to learn it (mostly
just to convert saltwater crab/tuna into one-pound chunks before
turning them in for tribute) I decided to go with a hybrid version:
I did the first stage of the quest until I got to skill 31, then
didn't bother finishing the 100 combines.  I didn't even bother
turning in the successful combines I'd gotten.  I just said thank
you for the free ingredients and then bought ingredients to train
the skill up further.

Note that the quests also each give you the ability to convert
some GoD-based raw ingredient into a more refined form that is
needed for other recipes.  E.g., doing the Smithing quests will
teach you how to convert Aligned Ore into Bar of Aligned Steel,
and similar for Shimmering Aligned Ore.  But if you don't do the
quests, you can still convert the raw materials by giving them
to the NPC on the boat (though you don't get back as much as you
will in the long run if you do the conversions yourself).

Meanwhile, on the flip side, there's my bazaar mule, who got his
tailoring skill up to 15 entirely by making Rallic Packs from
purchased ingredients.  (People sell the patterns and pelts in
the bazaar, and my other characters supplied the silks.)  I did
have to grit my teeth a bit when I first tried it, but it seems
to be true that any combine with a trivial of 15 is never-fail.

Maybe you misunderstand the meaning of the "Trivial" number,
and/or the effect of geerloks.  If your skill is at or above
the trivial, it means you can no longer improve your skill by
making it, but you may still have a significant chance of
failing each time.  (At low levels, if your skill equals the
trivial, your chance of failure is about 1/3.)  What's neat
about the geerlok is that it raises your effective skill for
the purpose of attempting the combine, but it does NOT raise
your skill for the purpose of skilling up.  So even if the
geerlok raises your skill above the trivial, you could still
get skillups as long as your REAL skill is below the trivial.
