Get her her own account for a birthday present (secondary present to
go with the rubies or diamonds) for one thing.   And make sure she
gets the best equipment you can twink her with.  :) (:  

I think the newsgroup environment can be very nice and engender the
community feeling.  The EQ design does NOT, works seriously against
it.

Por ejemplo:
No intercharacter email so it is difficult to maintain contact with
someone you meet and would like to continue doing so but neither of
you know each other well enough to exchange emails.

Can't "try on" a guild by being a guest on the guild channel for a
week or month or.....  you get the idea.  Can't be a "Guest"

No server wide open chat channels, either for selling  friendly
chat---would need at least a guide moderating with kick powers.

All of these were available on older online rpg's and Verant made a
conscious decision to not include them for cost's sake.  I think their
analyzing accountant made a major booboo.

Hope you still have the same attitude toward the game community in eq
in a year.
