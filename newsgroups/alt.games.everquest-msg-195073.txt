They're not large, they're 'heroic'. (ref Absor post from long ago about the
SoL female models)

Lady friend of mine and I were discussing how SWG apparently (from
screenies) has the ability to change how 'heroic' the female chars are, and
even at their highest settings are nowhere near as 'heroic' as EQ chars...
Hairdressers, tattoo artists... Doctors... Hmm... I don't see 'plastic
surgeon' on the professions list.
