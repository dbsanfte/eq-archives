My "Famous Last Words" moment with Gix

I was playing a lowbie Dark Elf Enchanter....

Off in the distance I saw Gix chasing some poor soul towards me, and
thought to my evil self "There's my good friend and fellow Dark Elf-
Gix". As Gix finished off his target I walked up and hit the  "Hail"
button...........LOADING PLEASE WAIT......

I had forgotten that I was wearing my Half-Elf Illusion in order to
buy/sell at the INN nearby heheheheh

DoH!

Cheers
