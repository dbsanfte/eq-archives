Id look at your ambient lighting in the room you Game in. I personally
play in a dark room so my attention is totally drawn to the screen and
if more light is needed, I turn on a mild lamp.  No grand spot lights
or Halogen lights.
Id also think your monitor to be suspect.  Is it an old monitor?  Try
not gaming on your PC at home and doing work, surfing etc.... does the
same issue happen?  if so look into your monitor or ambient lighting
being the issue.

Eye strain sucks...
