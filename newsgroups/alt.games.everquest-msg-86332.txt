Scarlet Desert has a few nice rare spawn drops.  Twilight has a few nice
drops off the elemental bosses.

I think the main reason that you're seeing craptastic lewts in DS, GF and TM
is that they're outdoor zones, whereas Netherbian is a Dungeon, dungeons on
average have better loot than outdoor zones of equivalent level.  (with a
few exceptions).

Of course, I've also noticed a lack of dungeons for that range in Luclin.
Echo caverns is about it.  Deep is too high, Ssra is too high, Akheva too
high, Griegs too high, Acrylia too high, Netherbian too low, Paludal too
low,

Of course, if you have a tracker in your group, be sure to hunt down the
'uncommon' spawns for Twilight armor pieces.
