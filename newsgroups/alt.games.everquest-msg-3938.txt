Ah, ok.  In the last week no one (always fewer than 6, including my 2
characters) was in SolA so my 49 druid and 51 enchanter farmed anything not
camped by people who could get xp from them (I hate high level farmers when
there's people who can actually get xp from a camp around...on the flipside
I hate to see uncamped rare critters alive).

I got 3 or 4 CGSes, a couple of foreman's tunics, around 4 platinum
armbands, 3 pairs of kobold hide boots (gave one away to someone nice
visiting in SolA...I forget their name) and the very much valued (by me)
infravision ring (I forget what it's called).  Oh, and a couple of mithril
quills (damned stingy Gabbie).

Yeah, I see how it's actually a pretty crappy item if it's GOT to be in your
shield hand (and it's nodrop).
