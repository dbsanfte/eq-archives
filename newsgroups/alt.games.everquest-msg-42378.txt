This was probably another troll by this moron but based on the level he
has claimed in the past for his warrior, I would assume he is talking
about the Overthere.  That would be VS faction, not the normal dark elf
factions.  If he has not hunted ogres in TD and stayed out of Kaesora
(which again based on his past claimed level, should be only spots he
could have taken a possible hit.), he should not have taken any faction
hits yet with the VS faction, he is probably fine, and might even be
high enough faction that he can turn in war braids off the sarnaks for
experience and higher vs faction, so that hunting places that lower it
later, he might not drop to KOS.
