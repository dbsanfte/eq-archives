I have to agree on this. Recently my rogue was farming components for
the noobie armor of an alt wiz gnome (which I already deleted by now
as I don't really like casters anyway) in the monitaur caves in
Steamfont. While many mino's in the caves conned green there were also
some evens and reds in the caves. Now roleplay is far to be found in
EQ - even on Firiona Vie - unfortunatelly but sneaking around the mino
caves and literally stalking and  assassinting the greens while the
reds are not watching is a great lot of fun and gives the true rogue
feeling. 
As for roleplay; I might give Star Wars Galaxies a try one day. With
it's item decay and stuff it won't be very Power Gaming attractive and
will focus more on roleplay (I hope)
