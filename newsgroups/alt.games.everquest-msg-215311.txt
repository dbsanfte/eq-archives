Correct.. Even changing the original billing and account information doesnt
stop that.

I had once an account from a friend.  I could not make any changes to it
other than creating new characters and transferring items from one account
to the other IN GAME.

The only way to do what you want, is to buy a new account and start from
scratch.. Oh, and BTW, all the updating you just did.. is gone.. you would
have to do it all over again, because all those updates are "attached" to
your friends account.

Passing accounts is against the EULA...  No.. they probably won't ban you...

I wish they COULD do something about Ebayers... I am so sick of finding
level 65 characters, and the Player is totally clueless how to play their
class.. "How do I /assist???"

Ugh.!
