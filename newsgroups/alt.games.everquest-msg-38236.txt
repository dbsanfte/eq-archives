In real life, often horses don't go all that fast in their normal rate of
speed.  Several of my friends who have used horses as pack animals on RL
hiking trips said that even when they were carrying packs, that they'd often
have to stop and wait for the horses to catch up.

Horses don't gallop all the time, especially when carrying riders or packs.

If they do it accurately, the horses should have several different speeds
(e.g., walk, trot, gallop.)  They should have their own stamina bar.  Gallop
a horse carrying an encumbered warrior in full bronze for too long, and that
horse will die.

In other words, they shouldn't have to speed up the monsters in the game to
make up for having horses.  It should increase carrying capacity, and give a
moderate increase in speed for long hauls, plus dramatically increase speed
for short bursts.

There's certain terrain where horses wouldn't survive well in, either.  Like
much of Velious.  Lavastorm's rocky terrain should pose a potential problem
for them as well.
