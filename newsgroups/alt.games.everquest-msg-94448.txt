I did this trip with a level 4 paladin because I wanted to group with
some friends who wanted to be barbarians. As others have pointed out it's
really dangerous. You have a reasonable chance of being agro'd and very
little chance of escaping if it happens. Doing the naked run across should
work though.

I did it the stupid newbie way. Waited until someone passed and asked if
I could tag along. People were, in general, really helpful to a polite
request and a SoW, Invis and bind can make the trip a lot safer. Waiting
at the druid rings and asking if someone would port you across as an
add on might work as well. If they're casting a group TP anyway it doesn't
cost more mana for another person.

However I did feel sort of bad about doing it. Effectively I was wasting
people time for an indulgence (wanting to play a high elf paladin). And
that was with having, somewhat, of a reason to get to Queynos (wanting
to play with friends). I probably wouldn't have done it if i'd known just
how long a trip it was. 

Made me feel really guilty when I wiped that paladin (16 levels later).
