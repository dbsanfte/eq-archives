OK, addressing my earlier complaint that my chanter had
tremendous downtime, I've worked on improving my tactics based on
advise in the newsgroup.

Refined, it comes to this:

Pull with Slow, move to a safe kill spot.  Three kinds of mobs:

Easy mob.  Melee with help of pet.  Should lose less than 10% hp
doing this.

Medium mob.  Back off once pet engages (never seen the pet fail
to get mob off me).  DOT mob (Choke, in this case).  Whirl Till
You Hurl mob.  Sit down.  Watch to see that pet wins, engage if
necessary... but usually not necessary.

Hard mob.  As with medium mob, but then engage again
immediately.  When Whirl wears off, Color Flux.  Back off and let
pet soak some damage.  Still, expect to see pet down near death
and lose 25% or more HP; this will be a meditation event.

With a mix of mobs, Exp comes in fairly steadily, three or four
pulls in a row, then med/regen mana back up to full while I go do
dishes or something.

Before doing this, I grouped from 10 to 13; I only had my 8
spells at that point, so no slow, best plan was for me to be
puller (including Lull as needed to get singles) so as to get
hit, then back off and sit while my buddies and pet killed mob.
I mezzed adds on the rare occaision we got any, and meleed when
full mana; if anyone in the party was really getting beat on bad,
I'd root mob and step in to tank; my twinkie status showing in
that I had three times their HP total and a decent AC despite the
fact that I'm a dress wearing class.  At this point I wasn't
using Color Flux or I might have been able to help out more, on
the other hand, at the pace we were setting I was going thru
plenty of mana just with lulls and mezzes and roots.

Comparing exp, this slap together group (beastlord, warrior,
chanter) got me 10 to 13 in about the same time span as I did 13
to 14, or 14 to 15 soloing.  With slow I'd expect even better
results with the 12 spells, and with haste and breeze, even more
so at 16+.  We'll have to see.

Matte, 15 chanter, Morel Thule
