Okay, wait a sec. You're dumping on me for being rude to a petty
little bitch who jumped in to take snipes at me, accusing me of not
reading the subject line of the post in my reply to the OP but not
providing where she got that I hadn't read it? And I'm somehow
"blaming" her for some mysterious mistake I made? Are you
intentionally being fucking dense?

The quotes you provided have NOTHING to do with whether or not I was
wrong about the existance of tools for the new UI. And I did not say
that there definately weren't any, anyway. But I suppose you can't
pass up the chance to play jackbooted asshole and kick me around, can
you?
