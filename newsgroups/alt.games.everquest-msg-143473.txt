That only works if you have the full screen mode at a different resolution
than 640x480, and you have the display settings set so that you do not keep
the same resolution on switching.  AFAIK the problem only happens with the
old UI, so what you have to do is go into display settings, and make sure
that it is not set to keep the same resolution, then cycling with F10 works.
Also, just changing the setting for keeping the resolution off and on will
work, as that will change the resolution of the screen into and out of
640x480.
