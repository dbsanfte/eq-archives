I've actually done both, so I can compare.

I started a cleric, played her to about level 12, then realized I
couldn't deal with the idea of playing cleric in pickup groups where
the enchanter wanted to pull because "if I don't get aggro, my pet
won't attack" and paid a druid friend to PL me to 24. Then, I played
in groups to 31, lost my regular group and played my rogue and cleric
together until she reached 35 so I could get rid of the damned spell
book.

The rogue, I twinked to the gills at level 6, soloed to 20, grouped
for a couple of levels to get my backstab up, soloed to 31, then
traded the fungal away.

Of the three methods, I found that PLing was fastest, but left you
least qualified to play afterwards. My cleric's 1hb was maxed, but all
of her casting skills sucked eggs. Even at 39, I can still
chain-fizzle with the best of em.  I don't expect her to be fully "up
to speed" until level 50 or so.

The rogue was much easier to slipstream back into grouping. Only
backstab was atrophied, but dropping 75 practice points and about 1200
plat into it maxed me back out. Of course, this may be a
melee-vs-caster thing.

What I found to be the BEST method was playing the two characters (at
level 39 and 34) together.
