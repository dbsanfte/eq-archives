I've decided this most fits my idiot, and I'm sincerely wondering if he knew
*how* to find his way back to LOIO on his own.  He mentioned he'd never been to
the Karanas.  Now I ask you, how can you be 58 and NEVER visited the Karanas? 
They are absolutely beautiful. 
I love the magus and the books and PC and the planes and LDON - well, ok I'm
not that fond of the planes. 
I think we are raising a whole generation of players who have never seen alot
of Norrath and have only played in pre-determined situations.  It's kind of
sad, really.
