256 is great.  Zone times (with 16MB video card) were about 60 seconds.
Frame rate was on occasion choppy if moving too fast (normally no
problem)...but Luclin would slow down frame rate & zone times slightly.  256
MB RAM is decent, but 512 if you can (you notice BIG difference).

Also since I upgraded to my ATI All-in-Wonder Radeon 7500 64MB AGP card,
I've turned all textures on (used to was running all but 1 or 2 of them on,
with medium textures) & set texture quality at max.  Everything is great
now.  I can definitely tell a difference, zone times are 30 seconds, 40 at
worst in bigger zones with allot of people on Luclin.
