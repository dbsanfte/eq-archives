spent some time freeing about 3 slaves and saw other groups freeing them.
There are slaves in droga also.  One slave that is freed is the half/wood
elf in firiona vie that gives a reward of a cloak that is ac 8 hp 50 mana 50
aura of health, which my bard is loving.  Other slaves that get freed are
burynai, sarnak, iksar, ogre, etc...  they all spawn in different spots and
should be indiff to all, overthere, sarnak fort back side in LOIO, near cab
in LOIO, etc.  the nurga slaves require pieces that drop off normal mobs in
nurga and named, the droga slaves require pieces from droga.  Alla's has
some info about this also.
