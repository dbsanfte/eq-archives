This sounds like your character files have gotten corrupted.  Another
possibility is the zone data files are corrupted for the zones those
characters are trying to zone into (either from another zone or from
character select).  Try moving some or all of those files out of your
Everquest folder, then do a full file check to recreate any of those
files (such as the default maps) that are required, and see if the
characters are able to zone in.  If that works, try to narrow down
which file was causing the problem, and then which part of that file.

The character files are Yourcharactername_Servername.ini and
UI_Yourcharactername_Servername.ini.  The most likely zone files to
cause trouble are the maps.

I do get the feeling that there've been a lot of posts like yours
recently.  I wonder if there's a new bug that's causing files to
become corrupted.
