I haven't played a Wizard since the first year of EQ.  It was murder.
Couldn't solo, couldn't find a group.  I rolled up a Druid and did 40 levels
in 5 weeks.  Druids can do a little bit of everything.  I can easily solo
(hate it) and never have trouble finding a group.  Plus I've got money from
all that porting.
