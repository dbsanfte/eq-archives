I play on FV as well, and it is hard to put a value on items that are
"No Drop" on regular servers. Here is what I do.....

1. Record the stats on the item (+'s, -'s, SV's, AC, Class/Race)

2. Search the usual places (Everlore, Allakhazam's, class boards, etc)
for tradeable items with similar stats and record the average price.

3. Set a price (what you will pay, or what you will sell for) on the
item based on #2 above. Then adjust your price up or down depending on
availability, difficulty to obtain, and overall demand. FV has a small
population, and prices seem to be a bit lower there than on other
servers. Fewer buyers tends to drive prices down.
