I'll stand prepared to be proven wrong, corrected, have my head bitten off,
etc. but I *believe* that this was already extensively tested and proven to be
false, an illusion, EQ urban legend, etc. Neither SoW, SoC, related potions, or
"quicky-runny-shoes" have any effect on swimming.  On floating above water if
levitating? Yes. Actual swimming? I think the answer is no.
  Dan, up for some more testing? Does you pally have j-boots on him?
