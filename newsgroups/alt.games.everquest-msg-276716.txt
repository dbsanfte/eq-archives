Right, so we're in agreement.  So either you misread my praise of the
change as a Good Thing, or I'm misinterpreting your post as a
misinterpretation of mine, and we're actually all in agreement.

Camping and regaining health == Good, and About Freaking Time.

I'm not saying the /home ability will do anything for XP, I'm saying it
will encourage people to get themselves deeply entrenched in areas they
really shouldn't have been in the first place, but not have to worry
about making that all importnt corpse run they might otherwise have had
to do.  I guess for most people still playing, you're all, what, 55+,
and so there's not many places that fit that bill.  But for us
admittedly few whos mains are still well below that mark... e.g., my 20
SK fights his way too deep into Paludal, I just camp out for the night,
log in in the morning and hey, no worries about having to fight my way
back out!  Automagic gate for the Shadowknight!  Or any other
non-caster.  I'm sure lots of people will view this as A Good Thing,
but as a long-time paper-and-dice gamer I view this as a Santifying of
the computer GM.

Of earning or deserving your fate?
