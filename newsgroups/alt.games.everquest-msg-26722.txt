Just wait until the cleric gets Superior Heal (level 34) or Complete Heal.
(level 39), the shaman is stuck with Greater Healing until 51 when they get
Superior Heal, they never get CHeal

But yes, everybody loves an exp rez, or even Revive to save a CR from hell,
or if the 3 hours are past.

Humans can't be a shaman, only class they can't be, and the only teleport
that shaman get is Gate, and the ability to make potions that port (which
are really expensive to make, and you don't get the alchemy skill high
enough to make them even semi-regularly until level 50 or so because alchemy
is level capped at (Level -24)*5)
