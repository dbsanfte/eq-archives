1) What is the Coldain opinion of Tier'Dal?

2) What can said TD to improve her faction with the Clerics in Rivervale?
Her faction with the Guardians of RV can't be improved per her faction
messages, they consider her an ally.  (Something like 1470 or so dead or
dented DF Orcs!  300-400 dead or dented goblins.)

Any help would be appreciated.
