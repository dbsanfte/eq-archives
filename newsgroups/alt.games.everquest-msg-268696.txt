Once you hit L9 artisan speak to Alfred Ironforge and select your trade 
subclass. You will then be allowed to join a new trade guild from which you 
will be able to buy scholars books L10-19. The guild is one that will be in 
your starting zone (eg in Greystone yard the scholars guild is the Minds 
Eye).
