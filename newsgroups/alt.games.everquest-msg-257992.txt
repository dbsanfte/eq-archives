I think the second paragraph is the key (no pun intended).  I've
sometimes gotten into a state where most of my keys fail to work.
Sometimes, of course, I find that I've started typing a line into
a chat window. :-)  Otherwise, I think the problem arises when I
have a shift/ctrl/alt key held down at an inopportune moment, and
the game ends up thinking it's still held down.  (I.e., the game
saw me press the key, but didn't notice when I let up on it, so
it thinks the modifier key is still down.)  I'm not sure exactly
what brings it on -- zoning? alt-tabbing? -- but usually if I
press and release each shift key, each ctrl key, etc., I can get
the problem to go away.

I suspect the problem arises most often with the ctrl key, because
one of the symptoms for me is that trying to move forward (up-arrow)
brings up a previously typed chat-window line, i.e. ctrl-uparrow.
