Get a legal defence fund together to absorb the cost, and hire an attorney
good enough to do the job.  If you've really got a case, then stick it to
them.  If you're case is questionable enough that you're not sure you can
win, then maybe you shouldn't be suing anyways.

As things stand now, it's possible to file punative lawsuits that have no
merit, using either a cheap attorney, or a pro-bono one trying to make a
name for himself.  Gun manufactures have been victim of these for quite a
while.  They have to pay their own legal costs, which usually includes
higher-priced corporate attorneys or settle for nice sums of money and
consessions.  Either way, they loose, while their opponents spend no
personal money (but rather charitable contributions and taxpayer's dollars).
Personally, I'd rather see it be a little harder to sue corporations, than
to allow the legal system to be used as a bludgeon.

The other idea I've been toying with was inspired by Hillary Clinton and her
socialized medicine.

Since legal representation is a vital service for obtaining justice, and
differing qualities of legal representation has the potential to skew said
justice, I believe we should governmentalize all attorneys.  Make them all
government employees at whatever level they're certified to practice.  When
you file your suit with the court clerk, they assign an attorney to your
case.  What could possibly be more fair?
