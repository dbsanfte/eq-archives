Haven't been there for ages, but if they put the BL area up above the
shaman with the SKs the trick is to jump just a hair before you move

and you'll fall off landing on the new level.  I did some cussing when I
first made my SK there, but soon came to enjoy those ladders as well as
the planks across the canals in Cabilis.  Something about a lizard
scampering around those spots at high speed and not falling off make
sense.
