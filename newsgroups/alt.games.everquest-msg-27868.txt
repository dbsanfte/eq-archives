Actually, you're wrong.

Say there are 200  in the 50-60 range on right now, and 100 in the 20-30
range.  And say 5 hours from now there are still 200 in the 50-60 range and
100 in the 20-30 range.  And 5 hours from then there are 200 in the 50-60
range and 100 in the 20-30 range.

The odds are strong that those are the same 200 players each time in the
50-60 range, yet a different set of 100 players in the 20-30 range.  The
reason?  Those in the 50-60 range are the one who are likely to be on for
very extended periods of time, those in the 20-30 range are not.  So then
you have 200 players overall in the 50-60 range, but 300 in the 20-30 range.

Of course, the sample groups aren't that clear cut, after all at least some
of those 20-30 players will overlap since they're on their way to be 50-60
powergamers, if nothing else.  But I'm confident the principle holds true
overall, thus showing how /who all count numbers could be misleading to
someone more interested in insulting than in thinking things through.

Bad science is always bad science, whatever the realm.
