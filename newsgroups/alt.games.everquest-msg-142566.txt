The main melee group is not the KS group.  The KS classes are not
sponges, they are damage Dealers.  Warriors, SK, and Paladins
(sponges, ie absorbers of damage) suck up the damage and do some
damage of their own, but monks, rogues, and wizards outdamage them
by quite some distance.  You'd think it would be a simple matter
to spread the damage dealers out some so that the kills don't all
fall to one group, but you'll usually find, if you can get people to
talk, that one group gets 90% of the kills... and that group usually
has multiple damage dealers and rarely has a cleric.  Even if a
damage dealer gets aggro, he doesn't need a cleric as a healer,
druid and shaman will do fine to keep him alive long enough for
a sponge to take it back.  Druid preferred, because while druids
aren't on the ultimate damage dealer list, they certainly can
contribute quite a bit of damage via a couple nukes.

Actually a cleric can do the same thing, unfortunately clerics are
the backbone of a raid as far as healing goes, so its rare we can
afford to drop a couple nukes per kill just in order to keep getting
the exp.
