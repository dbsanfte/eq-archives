I have never used such language when speaking to another character from my
character's standpoint.
Rarely do I ask for buffs at all because I typically can't pay for them.
When I do, I speak proper English, whether the person I'm talking to gives a
damn or not.
I think you are reading a bit much into what I have said.
I take the way other people talk with a grain of salt. Many of the folks
around you in this game could be very young, very new to English, or stupid.
Who cares if they're stupid as long as they don't get you killed or follow
you around asking for plat.
It's a game.
