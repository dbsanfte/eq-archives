Let me ask you this:

Suppose you are an airforce pilot in an F-16 near Washington DC or NYC today
and a jet carrying civilians (and only civilians) is confirmed to have been
hijacked and is flying through your area.  Your orders are to shoot it down.
What do you do?  Nothing because its civilians?

And I dont envy any pilot put in that position...My thoughts are with these
men and women today as well as with the Families of the lives already lost.
