Funny, I always thought druids were more of a priest class than shaman.
Here, let me change around some of the words to fit me so you can tell me
what you think of what you said

Enchanters get Gravity Flux at 39, and wizards get it at 44 (insert rants on
how Wizards are the pure DD caster, whine whine whine,)! This is completely
unfair, they have no reason to even have that spell! To compensate, Wizards
should get clarity (insert 7 pointless reasons, not all of them even have to
do with the subject, or EQ for that matter)! If you do not meet my demands,
I will not give you my 10$ every month!

OK So I exaggerated a bit, but hey now everyone else doesnt have to
translate...
Anyways, Druids get UV in one of their upper level wolf forms, and shaman
get the strongest speed debuffs(druids dont even get 1) and I can go on for
a while but I hope you get my point.... Nothing is fair. You're in their
little world now.... Just bite your lip and suck it down.
Oh, and for the record, I have no problem with druids getting that spell, I
think it makes sense. They're nature people, that sounds like a spell that
has to do more with druids than Shaman. Not saying it doesnt have anything
to do with them, but druids make more sense.
