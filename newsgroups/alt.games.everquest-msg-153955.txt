Hanging out with friends is only part of the game. The other part is
killing stuff. Take a high end guild, bored with HoT or all of Velious
or whatever content they mastered 6 months ago, and they're working on
mastering higher stuff. All of a sudden, the higher stuff that was
within their grasp is out of their league, as they need many more of
classes xyz and can't have any other classes present or the zone will
crash. So they have to go back to the lower stuff they did 6 months
ago and that now bores them, or not raid at all. And when they DO have
enough of classes xyz to try the higher stuff again, all the
guildmembers of  other classes are still left out in the cold.

Where's the fun in that? One is boring and the other excludes your
friends.
