I don't know about the PoP files, and I don't plan to find out, but I can 
say that EQ uses Apache/1.3.26 as the patch server and that all download 
restrictions seem to be implemented client-side in the patch program. So in 
theory one can still download the entire game from the patch server. BTW, 
the files are all gzipped.
