Well yes it is their game in a sense but they have chosen to market it to
the general public as a form of entertainment and to charge a fee for the
disks and a monthly fee for access to their servers.  The game belongs to
thoes who invest their time, energy and money to play "consume as consumers
of online games" what is presented to them as a viable entertainment
alternative.  The programming (i.e. intellectual property) and servers
belong to sony but the "game" which I'd say is the actual human experience
of interacting with the code, not the zero's and one's, belong to us.  If
human beings didn't play EQ all thoes millions of lines of code would just
sit on a server doing nothing.  Also, everyone who plays EQ certainly shairs
many common experiences but everyone also experiences the "game" just a
little differently than all the other EQ'ers out there.  Thats because each
and every human being is unique and no two are exactly alike... not even
idential twins!

Semantics... perhaps.  Maybe just simply the way some people view the world
too.  Some people just can't seem to discredit any authority regardless of
what it is or does and as huge a corp. as sony is, it is certainly in a
position to be viewed by that personality type as an authority.  Sony often
acts as if it belives it "owns" the game of EQ but sooner or later...
usually after a quratly finacial report I'd bet, they relent and make
changes that I'm suer they view as the will of the majority.  I believe the
problem with sony and their involvement in EQ is that thoes at the top who
make the fianl decissions about EQ don't actually play the game!  They
approch their decissions to make changes to EQ just like they approch a
decission to put a new technology into R&D or bring out a new electronics
product or back a movie.  That is a mistake.  The EQ experience is a
personal experience subtilly different to everyone who plays the game and
often, changes to the game dramatically impact a persons EQ "experience..
aka their enjoyment".

The point of my original post was to illistrate this very thing... everyone
experiences EQ differently and just because a person dosn't agree about
using KEI dosn't make them any more right that the person who can't live
without it.  Nor does it make either a better or poor'er player........
Gezzz, why is it even important if one is a great, good, average, poor or
horrible player so long as they are having fun and enjoying themselves?
I've NEVER left a group just because someone was a "weaker" player but I've
left a few groups because someone in the group was an idiot!

Personally I think KEI will go the way of so many other changes to EQ and
not to far in the future either, unless sony decides to let EQ sit and
stagnate as the release of EQ2 nears.  I don't think a corp. like sony would
make such a huge finacial mistake.  As long as EQ remains profitable I
believe sony will support and nurture EQ.  Many people will not simply walk
away from characters they have put so much personal time and effort into nor
will everyone be willing to run out and fork over several hunderds of
dollars to play the same game their already playing with a few enhancements
and better graphis.  So I'm going to take advantage of KEI while it lasts
since I don't believe it will be around too much longer, at least not in its
current form.  Everyone else can make their own decissions about using KEI
or express their opinion as to the limited use of certain higher level
spells etc....  We are in US of A aren't we.... but give others the same
courtasy.
