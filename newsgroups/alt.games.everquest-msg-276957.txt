PL'ing isn't even relevant for the vast majority of people.  It took me
months and months to get my first level 50 character.  PL'ing other
characters past the "been there, done that, twice" stage of the game doesn't
lessen the understanding I have from my first couple (legitimate) times
through those levels.

I'm plagiarizing "level awesome" though...
