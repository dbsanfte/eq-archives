Wrong?  Why is it wrong?  This isn't something where right and wrong
even apply.  It's a fantasy world.  It's Verant's fantasy world.  They
get to set the rules to be ANYTHING they want.  The could make the
word 'priest' mean the same thing as 'window washer' within the
context of EQ.

And just because you don't like the way the define priest classes
doesn't make them wrong either.  This isn't a black and white issue.

How druids and rangers fit into the game is VASTLY more important than
the labels that Verant and the players choose to put on them.  I mean
christ, if it mattered that much then monks should be characters that
cloister themselves in remote monasteries AVOIDING conflict for
spiritual meditation rather than kung fu ass whuppers.

I've done it with both classes Dennis.  I'm telling you, druid
tracking doesn't have enough range.  Particularly when that hunter
asshole decides he wants to spawn all the way over by Sebilis.  That's
always a fun pull.
