If you are not given clear and easy instructions on how to cancel a service
then they are scamming you. This is particularly likely if there are clear
and easy instructions on how to join.

My basic advice to you would be to start documenting an attempt to cancel
and to put any credit card charges into dispute. If you for some strange
reason allow them to loot your bank account via debit card or having given
them checking account numbers I would close that account and open a new one.

If the above dosent handle any and all problems refer the matter to experts
