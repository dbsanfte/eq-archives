Opening the tracking window and clicking cancel is the only way as far as I
know.

Rather than using the mouse to do that, just press the number 1 to 0..
whichever hotbutton you have tracking on. Better yet, map tracking to a turn
key (in options menu - keyboard and select macros from drop down menu), so
the window is always up (faster skillups that way).  Increased tracking
skill = increased range only.
