I saw somebody once bet on a "casino" where the odds favoured the
*gambler* rather that the house. Needless to say when the house
lost a LD ensued.

I asked why the gambler had entered what was obviously a sucker
operation... they said something like "500 plat isn't much to me, so
I was willing to take the risk."

In general the reason why some people play comes down to human nature.
Some people like risk, and are willing to bet a small amount if they
can get a big amount in return, even if the average net return is
negative.

That's why lotteries make money. :-)
