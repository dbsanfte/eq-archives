We are substantially in agreement, Yes.

Yes.  For example, I am a professional Software developer(Reality).   I
work with inDUHviduals who while they are paid and hence class 2
professionals, Can't write software to cut Room temperature butter with
a Razor sharp Kitana.  And hence are "amateurish".  When in High school,
I had friends who could write software to melt steel using a book of bar
matches, but they were in it for the fun, when they went pro/college,
they burnt out.  No longer fun.  

Example 2: The paradigm shift for Olympic athletes.  Until very recently
Olympic athletes were required to be "amateurs".  Did that mean they had
no skill, Nope, simply that they could not be financially rewarded for
anything to do with athletic competition.  Fortunately, they have since
realized that athletes need to eat too.
