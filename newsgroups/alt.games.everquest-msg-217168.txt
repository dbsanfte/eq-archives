I have 2 necro buddies that i EE sacrifice to each level. They have been 
helpful to me over the levels and 2 sacrifices per level is not that big 
a thing to me, I can always make up the xp=) and they appreciate the 
emeralds....and in return I get things like body calling [lol, note to 
self, destroy charsis key and never go back...] if i die in a difficult 
zone with a bunch of idiots that cant manage to get a CR together and 
get my body in a reasonable amount of time...one quick stop with a necro 
and his 2boxed in 65 pally and my bodies are in the LZ in charsis and no 
mobs waiting there to hit me when i zone in, a thanks hug, a rez with 
looting and a faithstone out to north freeport. One failed group there 
paid him to call all 5 of them and i rezzed us all, he made out like a 
bandit on calling the bodies=)
