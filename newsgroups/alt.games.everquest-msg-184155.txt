Well, take being main tank at a raid.   Knowing when to call assist, when
you've built up enough aggro that you are going to hold it for the entire
fight.   Knowing where you need to position the mob, which way he needs to
be facing, where the rest of the raid needs to be in order to hold him
steady, or push him where he has to go.   Knowing when to taunt, knowing
when to pop your AE taunt.   Timing of your disc usage.   Mob selection,
several in camp all being tanked or mezed... and knowing which one is the
proper one to go after next.

For non main tanks, positioning, knowing where the raid is pushing he mob,
and where you need to be.   Knowing how to control your aggro.  Knowing when
you should be off tanking a mob, and knowing when it is best left to someone
else.

As a paladin, knowing when you need to be healing, and when it's well in
hand.   Knowing when a stun is needed, even though you're trying to duck
aggro.

Pulling.  Knowing your aggro raidius.   Having a feel for how many of what
kind of mobs will come on any given pull.  Know your distance and range,
positioning yourself so the least number of mobs will aggro.  Knowing the
abilities of those mobs that do come after you, whether your group is fine,
or if you should be running back calling Evac! the whole way.   Or whether
it's better to just drop where you are and consent the rogue.


All of thse I would consider game knowledge, as well as skill.
