Your only hope will be Darkmoons, about the only major European guild left:

http://pub59.ezboard.com/bdarkmoon24144

They don't appear to be recruiting at the moment, but that can change.

Alas, most of the other European guilds fell apart after the UK servers came
online.  In fact, my current guild began life as a European guild that died
when the UK servers died and then was reborn as a US-based guild.

We have some European people in our guild still, and they delight whenever
anyone in their time zone joins the guild.  But we still raid based on US
evening hours, so you have to get up really really early to raid.

By far your best bet will be to transfer servers over to one of the UK-based
servers.
