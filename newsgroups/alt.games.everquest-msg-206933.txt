i would bet you failed to hide, since hitting the hide key only provides an
opportunity to hide...con something else, it won't be indiff

OH OH i'm sorry, hide doesn't work on undead . . it's a random chance at low
levels, but it stops somewhere along the line, and only IU works

THE ABSOLUTE BEST STRATEGY FOR CHARMING:

***have a good amount of distance between yourself and your pet & target***

always, regardless of whether you're a mage, necro, druid, chanty, keep your
distance
