Actually manual transmissions are more effiicient on gas.

There are of course going to be specific cases that argue
one or the pther point.  But you have to think of the country
as a whole.  How many people here in New Jersey commute to
New York?  They can spend $20 a day on gas!  Also, there are
people in the midwest that can drive up to 100 miles a day just to
work, not to mention the 100 miles back!  Plus you have the
trucking business, which cross-country drivers can drive over
800 miles in one day!  If that happened in the UK, you'd be
in the deep sea!
