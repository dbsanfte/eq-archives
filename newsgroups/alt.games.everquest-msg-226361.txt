The contest is irrelevant.

Never said I wanted it free. 'Gotcha' my ass; you aren't listening.

It works because the connection is entirely superficial. It could set on 
BORRATH, feature brolls, bogres, and biksar and it would be an identical 
game. The 'relationship' is brand name... just as CIBC Life Insurance is 
completely unrelated to CIBC Chequing Accounts... despite both being set 
in CIBC, using CIBC letterhead. They aren't different 'genres' they are 
different products.

Forget the damned contest already. Imagine for a moment that it doesn't 
exist, because it is completely *irrelevant*.
