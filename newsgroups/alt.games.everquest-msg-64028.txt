Heh... I've gone absolutely industrial on that quest (ally to the Ogres
while in human form by now), and used the proceeds to buy all my
equipment and lightly twink a couple of alts. The Surefall port has only
made the quest even faster (there is no need to kill the Koalindl fish
yourself... The regurgitonic quest will yield a fish *and* extra
positive faction).

I have to say that I rarely fail to sell the Steins for 200pp, although
it does seem to take longer these days. The Stein of Moggok remains one
of the best value-for-money items in EQ.
