You dont know bizbee very well I guess. looking like a dumbass is
meaningless to him.



to quote him "I have absolutely no idea wtf you are talking about" (or some
variation) he says this in almost every thread at some point, very clueless
about alot of things. the irony is he always calls YOU the idiot when he
doesnt understand what you're saying, its funny as hell.
