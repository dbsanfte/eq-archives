My guess would be reputation. Sometimes all it takes is a rumor to be shunned by your piers. The rumor does not have to true just
suspected. You and I both know this is the truth. He may have well lost the 60th player without having to delete it by this
incident. I would have demanded a server wide apology in the MOTD for several weeks to try and recover from the rumor mill but with
this GMs attitude I doubt that is gonna happen.

I can hear it now.
"OH you are that guy that Kriggan caught cheating in the tournament! No I do not want you in this raid."


Sounds pretty petty but you see it all the time with even lesser issues in the game.

After all it is a game. Why should anyone have to put up with stuff like that?
