Seriously? I have gotten used to the bobbing but I find for utility you
cannot go past it:

Levitate
 Enduring Breath
 See Invisible
Increase Poison Resist (64 - 70)

And it seems to last well over an hour too. Levitation combined with JB's
means it is easy to outrun things especially in rough terrain. DMF and
Shield of the Magi are the only two spells I always keep up all the time
regardless of what I am doing.
