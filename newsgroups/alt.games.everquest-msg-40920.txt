Good luck. Back when I was playing my monk, we also camped him forever and
gave up. I've hunted in that zone plenty with various characters and I've
never seen him.  People from Monky business said he's still in the game,
but probably one of the rarest of rare spawns for some damn reason. Hang
in there.
