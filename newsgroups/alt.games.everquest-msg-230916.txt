Shaman we have discussed.

Enchanter- Visions of Grandeur boosts dex by 25, NDT boosts dex by 120, 
no stamina buffs available.

Beastlord - Infusion of Spirit buffs DEX by 55, Dexterity buff DEX by 50, 
IoS buffs STA by 45, Stamina buffs STA by 40

Did I miss any?

So 3 seperate classes, that can buff DEX and/or Stamina, all of which can 
buff dex more than Stamina.

Aside from any of that, I'd have to agree with others here that Dex gear 
is just easier to find than Stamina gear.
