Q: What is a Berserker?

A: Completely Useless.

Instead of creating a new class (and a purely Melee one, at that), they
should've worked on fixing problems with the existing classes, or opened
some of the existing classes to other races (which they seem to be doing
soon).

I want a Vah Shir Monk or a Froglok Bard, dammit!
