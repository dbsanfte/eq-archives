No - it's not.  He quite clearly said that the freedom of action
that allows for roleplaying does not allow for the kind of rules
that create a fair PvP environment.

I'm not sure I agree, but it is not excusing the "I Kill noobs
because I'm evil" RP-Griefing rationalization.

I'm not sure I can envision a PvP ruleset that ensures fair competition
between players while allowing freedom of action - because anytime
you want to create a level playing field you must have an outside source
dictating who can compete against whom and when.

My last season of city-leaue B-ball (before I wrecked my knee) we played
a team that had taken the championship in our bracket the past 2 years
(and took it that year).  Despite the fact that we were the 3rd ranked
team in that level of play, they beat us without even breaking a sweat -
they swept all the way to the championship.  The next year they were
forced to move to the next higher level of competition by the body that
regulates the league.  The reason was to create a fair and competitive
competition.  

My point with this digression is that that sort of oversight is required
to ensure a level playing field in PvP competitions - and I believe that
it is antithetical to the more freeform playstyle that encourages RP.

The current state of PvP in MMORPG is akin to a group of these players
(former college players who didn't make the pros, or high end high school
players who didn't go to college for reasons having nothing to do with
their b-ball skills) taking over a public court by virtue of their 
vastly greater physical abilities and thumping all comers for the sake
of the gloating, not because they will ever be in danger of being 
forced to play to their abilities..
