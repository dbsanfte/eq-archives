I doubt it's lack of dx9 capability that's doing it. My geforce 4200 was
doing fine with the new engine, and raid lag was sped up majorly. There
are however, bugs in the new engine that need sorting out that affect
everyone. The old gf3 you have may be missing some part of dx8 they're
using if you're having problems no one else is. I know almost everyone
in my guild is having problems with zones sometimes not loading the
ground textures at the moment. It's funny running across empty space,
but camping or zoning after it happens is an instant crash to desktop
event.
