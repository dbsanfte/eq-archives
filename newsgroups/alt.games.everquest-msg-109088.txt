The day I spend $175 to buy an item in EQ is the day I'm quitting and going
to my shrink... "doctor I think I've become obsessive over this game
Everquest, I even buy things for hundreds of dollars for my characters"...
and the siren in the background is the guys in the white suits to take me
away for a little rest... sheesh. I just don't get it... just play them game
and earn them like most of the rest of us...
