Why swim against the wall?  Pushing continuously against a wall, at
least in some places, risks falling thru the world with the consequent
10k fall.  (Yes, I know you can get a GM rez for falling thru the world,
but you're talking unattended here, will you be back before the rez
timer runs out?)  It is much easier to simply spin swim, staying in one
place the entire time, and there are many suitable bodies of water for
this (Felwithe and Oasis are easy and obvious, there are others).
It's easy to do, simply make sure you are looking up a bit to avoid
drowning, hold down your forward and either the left or right movement
keys, press the return/enter key to get the chat cursor while still
holding the movement keys, release the movement keys, press return/enter
again to lose the chat prompt, and you will spin in circles until you
are stunned/killed (why to do it where nothing will attack you) or press
another movement key.

And as an added bonus you won't be nearly as annoying as the wizard
exploiting the crappy pathing in velks to kite spiders risk-free at the
bottom of the ramp.
