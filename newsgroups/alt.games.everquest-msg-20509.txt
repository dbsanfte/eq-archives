It just got *waaaay* better. They told me today that the new owners
would be happy to pay me, providing I sign either a two-year retainer
agreement in exchange for the one-time payment or a non-compete /
non-disclosure agreement.

Huh? Hello?

I don't have to sign squat - they *already* *owe* me the money, and
have for almost half a year now. I signed the non-disclosure when I
started the job almost a decade ago, and only a total moron would sign
up to be on retainer for two years in exchange for a single paycheck
that was owed anyway!

I sent them a very polite, professional reply. Once I stopped
laughing.
