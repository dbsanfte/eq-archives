Yeah, but basically, they only changed they way things are drawn. The engine
in the background is still basically the same. In fact, the problem with the
zone files not being fancy enough is why they put Umbra in. Thats the
infamous technology that made things run slower for a lot of people. One of
the biggest things programmers deal with in modern 3d engines is making sure
stuff isnt drawn that'd you'd never see. There are a lot of tricks that they
can do, but most of them depend on stuffing the map with 'visibility'
information. A lot of work goes into creating good visibility information,
thats why Umbra - even with its mediocre results - slows things down. Its
much faster to have the information built in. I remember reading once that
the zone files do have some basic visibility information, but it wasnt good
enough for Luclin to run well.
