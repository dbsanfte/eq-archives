Get Ulthork arms at least. the wisdom is the same, but it has
8 more AC. Easy to get.

Get another Revenant bracer. Easy quest. They are not lore.

Bloodstained tunic or a Crystal covered shroud if you
want wisdom here.

> Fine Steel Girdle 9AC

If you want wisdom get the crystaline belt, 5ac 3wis 3 agi 10hp

Do the Kromrif military legs quest.

Do the thurgadin shawl quest up to the 3rd level to get the
seal of the Thoridain range slot item. Easy quest, just need to
get your baking skill up, which is easy.
