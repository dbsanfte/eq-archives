Old term for a dos program that would "Terminate and Stay Resident" (i.e.
stay active, doing God knows what).  No mean feat back before the days of
multitasking OSes (I.E. Windows on the PC).  IIRC DOS 4 had a primitive
shell that allowed primitive task swapping.  This got (relatively) better
with Dos 5 but was abandoned with 6 as Windows became the way "forward".

Back then, getting your PC to run more than one thing at a time was almost
unheard of.  Both the hardware and software were just not sophisticated (I'm
talking about PC's (before I get a million Mac users on my case)).  Things
we take for granted now (i.e. having a zillion windows open at once) was
just a pipe dream for most folks.

TJ was referring to a trojan program capturing all your keystrokes and
sending *everything* you type to a 3rd party, who could then try to hack
your account.
