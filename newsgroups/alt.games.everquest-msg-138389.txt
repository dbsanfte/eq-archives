Normally I would agree.  Under the circumstances he outlined, I would have
preferred to see it rot than to see the people pulling that official list
crap get it.  If they did not have a cleric ready to do it, I would have
liked to see them find a cleric, not in the guild with the "list" and have
him loot it.  Even if the cleric who gets it is not done with the other
steps, better they get it that the assholes pulling that official list crap.
The Ragefire camp sucks as it is, don't need idiots trying to pull that kind
of crap to add to the aggravation.
