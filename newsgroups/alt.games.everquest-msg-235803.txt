For EQ its pretty easy, if you have to machine you could link them by the
NICs. If you have a hub its trivial, if you don't just be sure you grab
the right connecting cable. Then its simply copy across using the basic
netwirking of most OSs.

THe other option in a using a second HDD. Copy the EQ folder (and anything
else you need) to the second HDD and simply stick that into the new
machine and copy off. I copied all the software from my old Celery to my
new machine that way. You lose any registry info this way though (not an
issue for EQ but several other software pieces bleated for codes)

THe OS is a bit more problematic. I've only done that with Win98SE and
that entailed simply taking the old HD and putting into the new machine
as the master C: Drive. THen installing any spare drives AFTER that as
slaves. If this works with XP then it should be similar, however my techhy
friends do tell me this can fail sometimes, and you do tend to end up
runnig a smaller HDD as your master, though you do keep the regeistry
this way. THere are software packages around to help do this but I have
never used them.

Set jumper on HDD to be master, slave or Auto. Mount HDD in drive tray,
locate spare IDE ribbon connector, plug that into back of HDD, plug in
power cable to socket on back of HDD. Turn on, go through new hardware
addition. Format drive if necessary. CLose up case once you have seen it
all working.
