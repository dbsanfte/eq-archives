Well 3000 is better.  But it still looks like you never end up
with more than 75% hp, and at the same time never get healed
for more than 3k hp.  I'm trying to cross my eyes to make it
read differently.  Hmm, ok, how about this, it will heal you to
full, as long as you weren't under 25%, and as long as your
HP total was at least 4K hp. Is that what they mean?

I routinely heal tanks for between 4 and 5 KHP a pop, and mages
and clerics for about 3KHP.  These are, of course, the only logical
targets for CHeal.  If I'm going to be healing anyone else it will
be a remedy (fixing things) Ethereal Remedy (emergency) or Celestial
Healing (efficiency on a budget)

XP groups are where you do need efficiency.  On a raid, you only
need "sufficient force" but to get the best exp you need to use
your resources efficiently, not squander them.  If you aren't using
CHeals for close to 5Khp, then you really should be doing something
harder (if your mana is staying full all the time and you can't be
bothered to wait any longer for heals) or easier (if you are too scared
by how fast tank HP is dropping to wait for a bigger bang for your
buck heal)

They are certainly on my christmans list, but I have only heard
of one drop on my server thus far. Course the uber guilds could
be farming the things for all I know, its not as though they send
out press releases.  But they aren't showing up in bazaar or
being talked about.
