Same here, I mistakenly thought it was only 29 spd 16 dam with 5
damage added on the end when the magic damage worked. In other words
at level 20 max damage would be say 32 and if the magic dam worked 32
plus 5 or 37. Some people on the safehouse told me that through much
parsing it was obviously not that way. So the way the weapon works is
its 29 spd 16 dam, but if the 5 magic dam works its a 21 dam weapon so
at level wo you might hit for 42 with it. Of course unless you hit for
like 42 at level 20 you could not tell if the 5 magic damage was
working or not. 

My 36 troll sk has hit for up to like 84 with it, but being a druid as
a main I don't get into the whole parsing or "absolutely best" weapon
thing. I just know that I have no desire or need to get her a noct
blade now and this thing is really probably better. For one thing the
15 ac is fantastic along with a good shield. If I had a level 13 plus
warrior, I'd definately also get the nerf weapon (the scimitar) and
use that in the offhand for the 5 ac on it. The scim is a 29 spd 16
dam weapon when the 5 mr damage works.

I just wish you got some kind of notification when the 5 damage res
was added into the equation, but I guess it would be too spammy.
I'd never sell it either, I'd have to be offered some weapon better
than a noct blade for my troll sk and probabaly several good items in
addtion in trade.
