Just to avoid any confusion, the buff extension AAs don't relate to
the extra tick I was thinking about in my previous post. DoTs usually
(always?) seem to last one tick longer than they're supposed to
according to Lucy and the in-game description. I think the same thing
is happening with the heal over time spells but haven't sat down and
counted it. I'm just basing that on how close to full a Quiessence
gets me after cann5. 

Anyways, my point was, to figure out the real mana efficiency of
Stoicism, you're probably closer to 800pts for 180 mana as the
default, which brings your efficiency up to 4.44. Also, I don't think
a mana preservation item works with Kragg's, which would make skew the
numbers further in the direction of Stoicism. 800 for 162 mana is a
4.93 efficiency and you just passed Kraggs w/o having to worry about
low hitpoint agro before you heal. 

Just for kicks, if we look at Quiessence with an MP4 item, SCM, SCRM,
spec alteration and assume the free tick. You're at 2100 for 150 mana
for a 14:1 ratio.

I'm not sure what the cutoff is for mobs dropping the lvl 60
components but I think it's higher than a lvl 58 mob. That means you
have to get past the zone line in the 3 zones that appear to drop all
the research components; Veksar (highborn or frogs), SolC (elementals)
and ChardokB.
