No, it would be DAoC.
DAoC was always created as the anti-everquest. Everything EQ wasn't or had
failed to be DAoC excelled or at least bettered...This was intentional as
there was little point in the designers creating an EQ clone when EQ already
was dominating the market. With that in mind what would be the point in SOE
deciding to copy DAoC when that has already cut out it's own niche in the
market.

EQ has always had it's PvP servers with their various rule sets there is no
reason to try and copy DAoC when it is obvious that if EQ players wanted
something like DAoC they'd not be playing EQ.
