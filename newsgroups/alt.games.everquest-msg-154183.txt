ME? I'm just someone who comes here, reads  a few posts, sometimes
posting something in response to a question or topic.
But I'm about as much a troll as you are.
I only responded to DT so called criticism.
I "See" the trolls here, the guys that come in and go "EQ SUCKS"
and other crap like such..
But if you are going to respond to someone in a place of public
opinion you should do so with a relative comment , like most of you
do.
And by the way JJ most of you posts are good responses, only a few of
yours ever become insults and those are all aimed at obvious trolls.
