AFAIK, Clerics have always had a 5% bonus.  Other healing classes,
in the past, have had a healing penalty (and I want to say it was 10%,
giving clerics an effective bonus over those classes of 15%, but it's
been so long I don't really recall what it was.)  I believe the penalties
were removed somewhere around the Kunark era.

Caster's realm doesn't update their information as often as they
should.  Check out the last Q/A at that link.  :)

Looks like Luclin may have been closer to the era they
removed the penalties.
