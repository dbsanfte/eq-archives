I love D&D and have many memories from it but do people still play?
And what are your favorite memories?
Mine is when we where high enough level to go to hell .We went down and
fought our way to Tiamat(its a dragon that has three heads)In EQ terms you
would need 5 60th level groups to kill it.But this is D&D and it is more
about how you do it and not  "How it is done".Not  the physical but the
mental.
What is your D&D memory?
