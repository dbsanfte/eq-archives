When I zone into a new zone, I notice that it does take a little longer. And
because I've got my computers (networked) going through my router, I can see
the lights blinking when I'm actually sending or receiving data across my
connection. Durring part (or most) of this short pause, I don't show any
activity.  Its as if you start to connect and are put on hold for a few
seconds before continuing to load.
