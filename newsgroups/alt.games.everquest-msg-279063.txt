A little bit from "a" and a little bit from "b".

To start with there is a little bit of a catch 22 situation. Because
few people go there its hard to find a group and because it hard to
find a group few people go there! Questions is how did it get like
that?

To start with there is a lot of ignorance about these zones, the game
pushes you from the Qeynos areas to Antonica to TS and then to Zek but
it never seems to direct you into the various dungeons. And when you do
get there they aren't mine or many other peoples favourite place to
play: there's no map (there is a legal UI mod though) and the places
are a total maze; there are too many wandering high level agro mobs
(there is nothing more annoying then going around a blind corner and
bumping to a mob you have to chance against); you can't easily run
when it all goes wrong and the rewards aren't worth all the hassle.

And then there's the bugs. I'm not the only person who's PC
totally dies in Vermin Syne and crashes every time I zone out of
Stormhold. And then there's my favourite, the invisible mob bug. That
gets old very very fast. SOE don't seem to have acknowledges these
problems at all.
