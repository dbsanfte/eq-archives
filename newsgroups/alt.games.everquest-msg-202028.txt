It's pretty safe.  The mobs near the zone-in have a very small aggro 
radius.  If you are facing away from the "back wall" then there is a mob to 
the left around the corner, 2 to the right guarding teh stairs and a 
wanderer that can path right in front of you.  If you are standing on the 
port-in spot, you won't aggro any of these.

We've aggroed some through the walls at the port-in, and ended up with 4-6 
in camp.  You usually know it's coming because a lot of the mobs there 
emote when they aggro.
