Worrybird's review of the eDimensional wireless 3D Glasses:

I would love to review this product, but despite meeting all of the system
requirements, all it does it lock up and split game screens in half.  So, I
will settle for reviewing eDimensional 's product support.

The 24-hour phone support is a charge phone.  The good news is that the line
is tied up most often and they will have to call you back as I found out, at
their leisure.

The documentation is even more pathetic than usual, the one page
documentation is written from the viewpoint of someone who has forgotten how
to actually setup the system for the first time.  The on-line support is
equally pathetic.  Between the two, you can get enough information to
stumble into a failed installation.

This leaves their human support staff as your only hope. I resorted to both
phone calls and e-mail as the support response could vary from picking up
the phone on the first ring, to ignoring me for 18 hours.

Their support person exhibited a marvelous economy of words, which would not
be a quality I would include in a technical support job description,
answering most questions with the least information possible.

The following is an actual e-mail cut and paste exchange:

Nathan Newman: The Matrox is not going to work quite as well as a card like
the Geforce.  Have you considered upgrading any time soon?

Me:  What does not going to work quite as well mean?  What won't work as
well?

Nathan Newman:  The Matrox card will not work as well as the Nvidia.

D--uh!  Thank you Nathan!!!

I am now in my 19th hour of being ignored.  I guess they know my next
question will be "how do I send this piece of crap back?"
