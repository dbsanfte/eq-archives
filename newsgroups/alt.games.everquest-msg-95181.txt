I was quadding in CS last night (when desparate for a level quad!) and I was
amused by a bard quad kiting, I was also quadding and during our runs back
and forth (long empty stretch I call the runway, great for quadding) I
passed another druid tri-kiting. My point is, and I don't want to sound rude
or derogatory, CS is THE place for nice easy quadding. I did have a pull get
away from me and join the bards group (it was almost dead I apologized to
the bard and he said no problem) how this happened I have no idea as I
should have had full aggro. I'm sorry for rambling and making half sense in
my posts, but CS is predominantly quad-kiters territory especially up on the
plateau, also the warriors are good quad kite bait. but will screw up othmir
faction (this may not be a huge biggie to some but i'm a baker and buy a
bunch of stuff there) anyway enough rambling for me as i believe i have used
more then my 2pp (although i have good charisma)
