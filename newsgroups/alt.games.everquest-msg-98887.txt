Why thankyou, so nice of you to says so.
Yes I am one of these "idiots" Although the now we have an serverwide
auction channel I require EC far less.
If you want to not receive all these auctions then you could just turn the
channel off (F10, options, Chat filter or, now after the patch /filter
auctions) but of course you would of known that, only an idiot wouldn't RTM.
