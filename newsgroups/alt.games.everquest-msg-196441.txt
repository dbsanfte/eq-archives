lol - you usually see these shifts after a new expansion.
Before Kunark, South Karana was the high teens, mid 20's
place of choice - 100+ people at primetime.  A couple 
months after Kunark came out, the word suddenly got out
that LoIO was *THE* place.  The reason is that, LoIO used
to have a newbie zone ZEM (Zone Experience Modifier) so
mobs gave 1/3rd more xp per kill than they did in SK.
LoIO persisted as the place for teens and 20's, even after
the ZEM was reduced to the usual 75 for outdoor zones.
Then came SoL and Paludal caverns, at the same time they
were making big changes to the sub 30 game (adding more
rezzes, and boosting xp for sub 30 dungeons) in an effort
to encourage people to get out of the easy outdoor zone
grind.  As a result, PC, as a sub 30 dungeon, got a huge
ZEM, and, as word got out it became the new LoIO.
The difference is that PC is far less forgiving of poor
players.  LoIO/SK being out door zones, you can have
SoW up, easily single pull (druid harmony) and have
plenty of room to do stuff with adds.  In a dungeon,
lack of good pulling/cc skills leads to trains (as 
people still try to escape a death that can be made up
in 20 minutes).

I'm suprised LoY hasn't introduced a replacement for the 
one of the lemming captitals (PC or DSP).  But then, it usually
takes a while for the folks who flock to places like this
to get the word.  Leveling my kitty BL early after SoL in PC
was a dream - nearly empty, incredible xp :)  When my
mage was in his early 50's I used to have the Hole all to
myself - just as I was moving on though, people in my guild
(who'd discovered it from the guild groups my buddy and I
hosted there) were complaining that the easy spot in the
entrance was always camped - word had gotten out.

What you really need is a small group of friends willing to
go to places off the beaten track with you.  Long ago, the
gnolls in Splitpaw ranged from 7-9 outside the spires to 
the mid teens in the depths.  It was nearly always deserted,
because getting there required an incredible run from Qeynos.
People of the level to hunt there didn't have TP.  I was 
able to hunt the gnolls outside with my bard at 9-10 when
all the orc camps in EC were camped to death.  My friends
and I hunted the stuff in the bottom at 14-17 with no one
else in there (except the level 12 sk who'd made the run
through rathe, somehow.  We were so impressed we had to get
him to group with us).  That sort of thing is (IMO) far
more fun than the places which are full to overflowing with
some of the more juvenile folks in the game.
