Which would be a loss, because 5 or 6 people seems to be about the "sweet
spot" of group size in terms of gaming experience. Balancing social variety
with managing personalities, balancing the size of the recruitment chore
with the fun of working with people, etc. If groups get any bigger then a
lot of dynamics of grouping will change a lot, some of them (I suspect) for
the worse. Group size right now EQ works, so they shouldn't mess with it.

Yes, exactly. So filling a group becomes about balancing and adjusting
tactics to what's on hand, rather than a search for the one class that can
do X. "OK, we can get by with the druid as healer because we've got great CC
here, provided we make sure that...." That's fun, and works better in EQ
than any of its competitors. Certainly don't want to break it.

LDoN has added a new practical category for classes to be best at for group
purposes, which is "versatility." I don't know if that was intended in the
design of the expansion, but its a good outcome which balances the premium
that raiding places on the specialist classes.
