Your youth and ignorance of history is showing. Just because the WWW
has only been around since 1991 doesn't mean that online discussions
weren't happening.

Arpanet, the precursor to the Internet, was started in 1969.
The official start date for the Internet (the day Arpanet switched to
using TCP/IP) was January 1, 1983.
BBSs have been around since the late 70s.
Fidonet started in 1984.

So, you see, 20+ years is not at all unlikely.
