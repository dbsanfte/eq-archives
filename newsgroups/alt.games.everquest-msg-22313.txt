What? That's ridiculous. By that yardstick, upping your resistance gear 
before you go hit a dragon is an exploit, as you know of their behaviour 
and are acting to nullify it.

Am I supposed to play this game as if it were Gauntlet?

It *can't* negotiate the river in any other way. Those rivers are high-
walled moats, and you must find a ladder to get out. Jumping is the only 
way across. It is not my fault that Verant never taught Orcs how to jump :)
