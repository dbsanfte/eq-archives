I was in a group of six with two of them being friends (we were in
RoV).  That night, I think I won a total of one lotto, while those two
friends probably won over 85% of them (I did get a couple adepts from
NGB).  The very next day, I won something like 90% of the lottos (one
of the guys in the group threatened to report me for hacking or
something).

I don't think there is a hack or anything going on, but I do think the
lotto gets on strange runs occasionally.  I bet if you kept a log, as
you get a larger sample size (assuming same group members) you would
see it evened out.  Of course, I'm pretty naive :P
