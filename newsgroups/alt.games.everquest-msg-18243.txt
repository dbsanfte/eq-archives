I never said they weren't girls, still doesn't mean i want
to view any of them.  a girl with tape on her glasses and a
pocket protector doesn't thrill me either.  I was just
trying for a goof on the spam, cause it showed up in just
about every newsgroup i read,  and people in this group
USUALLY have a sense of humor, guess not this time.

Cthulhu Loves Me

Cthulhu loves me, this I know
For the High Priests tell me so
He won't eat me, no not yet
He's our Lord, all dank and wet
