I think that the female characters people play in-game, are very telling.
Some males play a female as simply a male in female clothing, with no
attempt to assume a female persona, some play it as a parody of a male
sexual fantasy and some play it by denying they are male altogether.

I find it fascinating.... surely it has to show some insight into their real
life, exactly what that might be, I have yet to discover.
