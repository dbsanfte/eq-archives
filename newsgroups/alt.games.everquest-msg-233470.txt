The problem is the mistake ISN'T minor. It's actually an attempted
felony. (A scam via the US Postal Service, if anyone bit it would be
crossing state lines as well.) And, fuck, anyone with half an active

so much money has to be a load of bullshit. It's rather depressing
that people do fall for it.
