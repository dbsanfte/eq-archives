Sometimes I get a situation where corpses all get the same head for their
species. There was a guild who did a duel, and they are pretty troll
heavy...there were about 10 different bodies at the sebilis bubble, and all
of them had the same face. Leaving aside the odds of such an improbable
thing, I *know* that some of them had different faces than that.
