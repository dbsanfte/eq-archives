ICS works for me *except* when patching.  If machine A is running ICS,
and machine B tries to patch, machine B gets errors.

My normal single-account setup is machine A running EQ, and my ISDN
modem connected to machine B, which runs Linux and provides the
connection sharing.  I'm using a 2.4 kernel with iptables, and it
works fine.

This setup is very good for accessing the net while playing.  For
example, if I need to look something up on the web, I do that from the
Linux machine.  Hitting a web page that has a lot of graphics, or a
huge amount of text, causes EQ packet loss to zoom up to 50% or even
75% for a second or two, then the Linux network code's traffic shaping
code kicks in and limits the browser so that the EQ packet loss drops
down to a steady 10% while the big page loads.  That's low enough that
you can still play reasonably, and, more importantly, it is not so
high as to get you disconnected.
