I highly recommend CC also. I went there with my monk around lv 32 and the
30's just flew by. In fact lv 35 never seemed like a hell level to me. I got
a CCS which I'm still wearing, and several foreman's skull caps, several
herbalist packs and several crystalline belts. The bank in the zone and the
vendors you can buy basic supplies from and sell loot to make this a monks
dream zone. My only problem with the place is all the good loot is lore. I
let at least 5 herbalist packs and at least 3 crystalline belts rot on the
ground cause I had one already. I recently hit 45 and I did it soloing
geonids and terrors, so you can stay there and get good exp for a long time
yet.

removed it.
