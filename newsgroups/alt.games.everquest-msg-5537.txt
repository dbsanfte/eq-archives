Well, my day in EQ went well. My Druid is 16th level, and she seldom
worries about levelling, as her purpose is to explore and do quests. 

I was in Kurn's poking around when I took out an excavator that took
exception to my presence. Rough fight, but I won. I also got a mask
with decent AC, str and dex bonus. Nice, my face slot was still a
patchwork. I decided to try the old Tumpy quest, and the Dwarven wire
quests to see if any changes had occoured. Long travel later, in
Timorous I encounter a fellow having problems with an ogre. Ogre
yellow to me, player green to me. Uh-oh, somebody wandered too close
to a baddy. The player is a warrior, so I let him tank while I drop my
mana pool in DD and DoT's on the baddy, and a bubble of mana on heals.
The ogre drops, this guy is tickled to death, and gives me some split
paw gloves. 
 Sweet, off come the mesh gloves, which I drop on a green Iksar monk
who is waiting fro the barrel barge. He is happy, some AC and now he
can hit magical. I suggest he whack wisps and sell to the shady
swashbuckler in the tunnel. He is tickled that someone helped him
without provocation or expectation of reward, gives me the name of his
chanter, and says I have free breeze/clarity for life when in the same
zone. Bonus!
 I make it through Ro, a few drive-by SoW's and Skins in N Ro gets
some smiles,salutes,dances, and I am on the dock at freeport.
Downside, I decide to fish and replenish my fish scales. First cast,
pole breaks. Grr. Pop in to the shop and buy another. I get a stack of
bait too (I love that buy a stack option!). Head back, cast again,
Break pole! Argh!. I remeber a mysterious Lore/Nodrop pole i got in
Tox, so I go to bank and grab it. Head back, barely make the boat as
it pulls away. I trade languages with a fellow traveller (Gnoll for
Elder Teir'dal) while we wait. I hop off at sister's to get some Kiola
nuts, still spamming each other with languages until the traveller
zones. While there, I see an Iksar killing the locals. He satutes and
runs off before I can explain the maintenece of balance that the
sisters provide. I check the bodies lying around, 3 belts of Purity
and some money. Hmm, these can be of use to others. I put one on
(replacing my cloth sash) and wait for the boat. I catch 5 scales and
3 fish waiting. Not too bad. Zone to Butcher, I OOC the first newbie
to poke me at the Druid Ring gets a prize, then head to the ring. I
get one offer, but the poor thing gets lost. I lead him back to
Kaladim and give a belt. I get a poke from another while medding by
the PoD. I give up the second belt. 
 My work here done, I pop over to Kelethin for some trading, and gain
a Velium Scimitar and a gold +3wis earring for 80pp. Nice! Now, being
near broke, I head to Crush to look into a Shiny brass Sheild to sell
and work on my 1hs. I forget I am wearing one and they are Lore. Rats.
I shout that there is an SBS for the next taker on Trainer hill. Ever
seen a newbie train in Crushbone? Heh, wow! it looked like all the
dwarves and elves from the mines, except they were named! A happy
young Dwarf cleric beat the rush, and equipped his new sheild. Oh
well, I got experience for the kill, at least. 
 I wander into the castle looking to join a group hunting Crush to get
a tunic, as these sell well on Antonica, for some reason. On the way
over, I see a hapless bard attempting to outrun the Warlord, and
failing. While snaring the Warlord to give the bard a head start, the
bard dies. Dang, I was just about to heal, too! Well, the Warlord was
a bit upset with my actions, and heads over to discuss it. He is about
1/4 dead, so I decide to try kiting him. Being that I am not real good
at kiting, and this is not an optimal kiting area, I take quite a few
smacks, but I win. Now I finish the Lego and couple of Cents that have
joined us with cascade of hail. I look at the warlord, and guess what?
Bracer of Battle! Woo Hoo! I think I'll do the Screaming mace, now.
Then drop the mace on a newbie Druid. That and a fire beetle eye. You
know how hard it is to get one of those in Gfay?
