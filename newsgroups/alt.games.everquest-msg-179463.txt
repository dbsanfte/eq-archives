Not me, I think it sounds like a great expansion and it's cheaper and easier
to get than the others on top of it.

Perspective please.  Even with the cost of new expansions EQ is REALLY cheap
entertainment.  Lets say you bought ALL the expansions seperately and paid
top price of $30 for each of them, and $20 for Ykesha, your total cost for
ALL expansions would still only be $170. Then if you add in the cost of the
monthly fee of $14 per month, your total cost is $338 for ALL expansions and
a years worth of playing costs.  If you only played EQ for one year, then
your entertainment cost for a year would still be less than $1 per day.

So buy Ykesha and enjoy it!
