heh.  I'm doing ok.  Sold a complete suit of banded the other night
(smithing is up to 114).  Had to go back to freeport to do it but I'll make
it back to Kunark soon.

While I was in Kunark, I killed a goblin witchdoctor and let my wife, the
enchanter, loot a +3 CHA dolly.

With some of the money from the smithing, I was able to buy my ranger goblin
skin arms and ulthork hide boots.  I got both for 20pp each.  I look
mahvelous.  The goblin skin is black and the boots are grey so the go with
the shiney banded.   I forget what the stats on the goblin skin were but I
wanted them badly so I'm thinking they upped my strength.  The boots are
magic so I can kick magic stuff.  Lowered my already low wis.  I'm now
75int, and 62wis.  Not the brightest bulb in the room but he means well. )

2 steps back, 3 steps forward.  I think waiting for the upturn after a
downturn is what keeps me playing.

Thank for the thought,

Lewis
