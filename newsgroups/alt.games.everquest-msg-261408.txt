Right click on your desktop shortcut.  Go to the shortcut tab.  Under
the target heading change this to point to your Everquest.exe file.
Mine looks like this "C:\Program Files\Everquest\EverQuest.exe" ... you
will need to put in the inverted commas as well.  In the same area you
will see a heading Start in ... ensure that this points to the folder
where Everquest.exe is located.
