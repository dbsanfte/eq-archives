I only started playing earlier this year but some of the changes I have 
really appreciated are the pet changes (agro, exp, resistances etc), 
Mage summoned focus items, bazaar and the new UI.

I like the new spell focus effects on items but I'm not happy that they 
have somewhat superceded the Mage summoned focus items. I see it as if 
they balanced out the Mage class by providing the ability to summon 
focus items, then unbalanced them again by giving every other caster 
class the opportunity to buy the same effects, and a few better effects, 
on other items which have extra stats too. Its kind of like putting in 
an item that summons the Wizard's familiar which can be used by any 
caster class.
