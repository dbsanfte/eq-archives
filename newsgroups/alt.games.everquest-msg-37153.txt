If you have a level 50 friend who's afraid of the drachnids then he must be
highly misinformed about their level or a bit of a wuss since they're around
level 35!

Also, I've been in the same situation as you with those dracnids, they got
me a lot when I was around level 20. Once time I actually had SoW, 1
poisoned me and beat me down and I zoned into LOIO with a mere 100hp left, I
ended up getting stuck in a rock in the water and couldnt bandage myself up
to try and deterr the poison (I could bind about 20-25hp per bandage so it
would have saved my life, but crappy geography on Verant's part took my life
away for the second time.

I get used to it most of the time though, dying is a Halflings job :)
