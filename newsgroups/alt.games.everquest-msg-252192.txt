I two box on EQ. I have a Pentium P4 2.4 as my main computer and an old
Pentium 750 as my 2nd with a home network plus an ADSL connection (though I
used to do it with a 56 dial up connection).

I have two EQ accounts but have only ever loaded one set of disks. I have
simply copied them on each computer. My main has two hard drives and has EQ
on each drive, the second computer has EQ set up twice on it's C drive.
Programmes are run from the desktop as EQ1 and EQ2. (You don't need to have
it like this it just saves the hassle of having to change you login details
when you connect each time).

I two box in two ways. Some times I am using the second computer for
something else in which case I may solo one character on the main and leave
the other trading in the Bazaar. When actively adventuring with two
characters the main  computer controls my more active Paladin who is
tanking, fighting and pulling, the less powerful 2nd computer with slower
graphics controls my druid who is mainly static buffing, healing and DOT'ing
mobs.

I have tried working off one computer when adventuring but the time element
when switching screens is annoying and can be critical. I prefer to be able
to see what is happening on two screens. I use my main 19" monitor and a
cheapo 15" LCD monitor plus one Microsoft keyboard and a mini keyboard on
the second computer. An alternative method is to use a switch box and then
just use one keyboard and monitor - again the downside is that you can not
instantly hit say a heal hot key or an evacuation hot key with out switching
from one computers to the other.

I would not recommend two boxing whilst grouping - you are never going to be
as effective as two individual players and you must always tell people that
you are two boxing if asked to group.
