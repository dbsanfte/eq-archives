How much did you spend twinking it? I twinked a frog pally with over 15k
gear and have no problem keeping melee and casting skills up even with
Blessing of Aegolism on (actually easier because it takes about 6 FM to heal
up 1800hp). The only skills that suck right now are Bind Wounds (snix) and
Archery, no biggie because it's only for pulling.
