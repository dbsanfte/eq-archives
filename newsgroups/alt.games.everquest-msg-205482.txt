Can't answer for 65 or for cleric specifically.  At 63, I can solo in 
Cazic Thule on the entry mobs, in Fungus Grove on mushrooms and dregs, in 
The Grey on the big skeletons, many mobs past the entry area in Chardok 
and in OS.  Personally, I tend to pick CT and FG.  CT for the blood 
drops, FG for when I feel like tanking again.  Also, at 63, Torgiran's 
Mines, Nadox, Dulak are all viable.  When I really want to go all out for 
xp, I group in CoD/BoT/PoV/PoS.
