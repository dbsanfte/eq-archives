Yes, druids do get a buff (at 29, I think - gives haste, ac and atk bonus?)
that previously worked on charmed mobs. It was in game long before they ever
introduced that worthless bear pet. /sigh I just hope they fix this. I don't
charm a lot; but it was a fun diversion from time to time. Be a shame if
they've broken it permanently. I mean, my enchanter can still buff *her*
charmed mobs, so why shouldn't my druid be able to?
