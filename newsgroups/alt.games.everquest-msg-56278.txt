If you find SK's to be able to out taunt a Warrior then the warriors you
have grouped with were either not taunting constantly or under equipped in
comparison to the SK's.

My Warrior has only ever been out taunted by other Warriors or higher level
Hybrids.

Not sure what makes you think SK's make better tanks as to holding aggro, be
interested in the answer.
