WoW better have absolutely fabulous support. I read somewhere (forget)
that they expect something like 3 million games sold. At $15/month - works
out to something like $500 Million/year in revenue, excluding the cost of
expansions. If they manage those kinds of numbers (seems way too optimistic,
but who knows), they dang well better have a staff of 500+ cranking out
content, managing servers, patching code, etc, etc.

I wonder if Blizzard's thinking goes along the lines of the following:

"Little Johnny" or "Griefer John" (the high school version of Johnny)  is
going to ask for either EQ2 or WoW for Xmas, as well as a year's
subscription. That works out to something like $200. So, if WoW
isn't out at Xmas, but EQ2 is....then Johnny ends up with Sony's
product - and most parents aren't going to go out and buy their
kid *another* mmorpg a couple months later.

Sure, most of us with jobs would have no problem buying which ever game
came out second (assuming the first one didn't grab us) - but that's
probably not the case for the middle and high school kids. And Blizzard's
demographics are such that there are a lot of kids playing their games.
But those kids are impatient. They'll play EQ2 if it hits the shelves
first - leaving Blizzard in the cold.
