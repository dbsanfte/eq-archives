I have a level 13 wizard (Miznit), and he's a gnome.  While I have been 
having tremendous fun with him (grouping up in Unrest, mostly), I seem to 
be in need of some good (relative to level) Wizard gear.  I am going to 
do some searches for quests, etc here in a bit, but thought I'd throw out 
a question on what different opinions are out there insofar as what I 
should be looking for.  I don't mean down the road in 20 levels or so, 
but in the near future and even NOW.

His current gear includes an earring with Mana Pres 1, a +10 mana 
necklace, and +20 mana gloves.  (The necklace came from a quest in 
Innothule Swamp, the earring a loan from a friend, and the gloves a gift 
from a high level guy that was logging and wanted to get rid of some 
stuff.)  He also has an engagement ring with +2 INT.  Everything else is, 
well, crap..excpet for a little AC  and to hide his nakedness.

Any opinions will be respected, and maybe even adopted!

as an aside, any opinions on what I should be thinking of for a last 
name?  Miznit the Gnome Wizard has no ideas yet, nor plans....open to 
ideas.
