I remember why I created a bard, the solo potential.  Just the other day  I
thought I'd pay a visit to lower guk to solo a bit.  There was a group of
37-40ish toons at the entrance that wanted to move down to frenzy.  They
asked if I wanted to join, and having nothing better to do, I said sure.

The gong show begins....
Casting invis vs undead but missing 2 guys
some of the group stays at the entrance because they don't know the way
some of the group makes it down the hall to the water before BR
(unfortunately one of the guys who was missed with the invis)
2 guys dead  in the water.
Waiting 30min for some dork to get his cleric buddy to come and res
3 guys leave

1 hour later, my xp bar didn't move a pixel... and I was one of the lucky
ones :)

Back to solo...

Wow...;
