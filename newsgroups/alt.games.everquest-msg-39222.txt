Because they're in a low xp zone.  Some low-level zones have a higher
experience modifier.  Actually, I have no idea what the actual xp
modifiers are for most zones, and rathe is likely average while OT is
slightly above average.

Yes.  However, giants are also bad xp because they're seriously
underconned.  A L35 giant has a lot more HP than a L35 cactus, so even
if they were in the same zone, killing cacti would still be faster and
therefore better xp.

Actually, this is probably a bigger factor than the zone experience when
comparing outdoor zones.  I believe it's mostly dungeons that have
particularly high xp modifiers.
