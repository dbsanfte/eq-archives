WASHINGTON, D.C.

Chief justice urges higher pay for judges

Federal judges are overworked and underpaid, and the ``crisis'' in the =
courts will only get worse unless Congress and the president take =
immediate action, Chief Justice William Rehnquist warned in his annual =
report on the federal judiciary, made public Tuesday.

Rehnquist, who joined the court in 1972 and was promoted to chief =
justice by President Reagan in 1986, noted that he's been raising =
similar alarms for several years, with little success.

According to Rehnquist's report, more than 70 district judges and =
appeals court judges left the bench between 1990 and May 2002, many of =
whom noted that financial considerations were a ``big factor'' in their =
decisions.

That is ridiculous and shows how incredibly corrupt the legal system =
must be.

Nine states challenge new pollution rules

Nine Northeast states filed a legal challenge on Tuesday in federal =
court to new pollution-related rules for power plants and other =
industrial polluters that were published just hours before by the Bush =
administration.

The state attorneys general said the rules, which were tentatively =
announced last month, constituted the most serious attempt at rolling =
back the landmark Clean Air Act since it was enacted more than 30 years =
ago.

So no one cares that the temperature is getting noticeably higher?

Cloning company says baby `Eve' is at home

A baby said to be the first human clone has gone home with her mother, =
according to a cloning company linked to a sect that believes space =
aliens created life on Earth.

This was published in a reputable newspaper, not some gossip rag.=20

The baby, nicknamed ``Eve,'' went home Monday, said Clonaid spokeswoman =
Nadine Gary.

The company has refused to say where her home is, or where Eve was born =
Thursday.

The unidentified mother is a 31-year-old American, Clonaid officials =
said at a news conference last week in Hollywood, Fla.

Attorney Bernard Siegel, meanwhile, asked a Florida judge Tuesday to =
appoint a guardian for the baby, saying that Clonaid is trying to =
commercially exploit the child and that she needs specialized medical =
treatment.

Why not make the world government it's guardian?
