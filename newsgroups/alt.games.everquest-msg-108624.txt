I have 2 boys one 21 and the other is 16. 21 year old is in college now dealing
with those kinds of "teachers" now getting his degree in computers specializing
in networking. 16 year old is in High school taking college level accelerated
classes because of his GPA. I guess I have taught them a thing or 2. It always
flows easy for the younger son. I guess he will not be a teacher either unless
he truly wants to.

Never said there was anything wrong with knowledge. The way Scholastic
institutions believe the way that knowledge should be apllied is where the real
world has the problem. I don't teach, I own a very profitable business that
allows me time to partake in amusments like Everquest. Got tired of college
after the second semester because of the believes of those institions. To many
live in their own world and it has very little to do with the real world. There
are very few "real" teachers out in the world which is why phrases like that one
exist. I find I learn more by being self taught. I guess that means I am a
better teacher than most that are paid to teach.

They make History! They don't teach it. =)


Just to elaborate this is not a blast at all teachers. Only the ones that treat
their profession like a job and it seems there are way to many of those kinds in
the system right now which is why the US education system is in the shape that
it is in.
