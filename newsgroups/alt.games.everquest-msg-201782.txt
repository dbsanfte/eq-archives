I have to cringe at this one myself.  I have a really good friend who used
to play EQ; he got up as high as 52 on his pally.  In an effort to help him
get massive XP, we took him to Disease and worm-hunted until he could be
flagged for CoD (backdoor).  With full support from a 63 cleric, 62 chanter,
63 shaman and a 65 ranger, he could tank the mobs in there - but the cleric
and shaman had to spend massive mana to keep him alive.  We ended up having
the ranger tank it out; things went better.

IMHO, a 55 anything can exist in a group in these zones if they're grouped
with higher level players.  A group of 55-60s fighting level 63 and higher
mobs for every fight?  Waste of their time, they'd get better XP in almost
any other zone with large numbers of blues.  All they're going to make is
graveyard lag and trains.
