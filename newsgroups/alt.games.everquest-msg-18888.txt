Ghoul Lord in Lower Guk.  Probably just out of your league at level 40,
but it's the common drop and I see them auctioned on Cazic Thule for
under 100pp.  Very common item, also a very good item.

Well, you mentioned you have a cleric partner - if he's 39 or over, you
two can make a small fortune in cash by hunting hill giants in Rathe.
Get buffed to as many HP as possible, get a good weapon out, and just
kill HG's while the cleric complete heals you.  Then watch the platinum
roll in.  Oh, Jboots or SoW potions are really useful for pulling the
HG's.
