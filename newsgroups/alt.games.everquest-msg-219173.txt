Let's see...your time is so important that saving you 250 ms to click at the
bottom of the post to move the insertion point is more important than the
dozens of seconds each of hundreds or thousands of readers have to spend to
sort out the threads you mangle?  My, you have a rather inflated sense of
your importance, Your Majesty.

No, you don't bottom post to "follow the rules".  You bottom post because it
has been proven, both by theoretical consideration AND 20 years of
experience, to be better for the reader, at little cost to the poster (or no
cost if you aren't so lazy that you insist on using the POS software that
came with Windows).
