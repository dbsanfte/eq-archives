I would recomend Marus Seru until 30 and then head over to DSP.  Both those
places seem to be pretty hip these days.  Alternatively South Karana, though
it isn't the happening place it was when my Necromancer was young.  My
cleric is up to 33 now and has been doing Dawnshroud and Overthere.

Best of Luck!
