I would say shaman.

Good soloers once they hit 34 (first pet), becoming very powerful at 49+
(stoicism (mini - torpor) , Canni II, new powerful dots and pet). Good
choice of solo tactics (root rot, tank for pet, JBB etc).

Also very desired in groups, probably as much as clerics once you start
hitting the planes, best melee stat buffs, ok haste, great debuffs, best
slow in the game by far.

The worst thing about shaman is the cost of the good spells they are too
friggin high, but I would say they are one of the best choices if you like
getting groups (and getting them easily), or just sometimes like to chill
and solo for a bit.

Shaman are also capable of taking out some pretty meaty targets that usually
takes groups / raids to do (much as necros can, usually different types of
mobs though).

As you said 'some' soloing ability I may suggest ranger also, from 22 - 55
ish they can solo any animal, but there group desireablity pre- endless
quiver / archery mastery 3 is fairly low, as they are basically rogues with
nukes.  Though for LDoN there snare is invaluable, but not unique to them.

An SK may also be ok, but have never played one so do not know the viability
of an SK fear kiting, I would guess there damage output would be too low to
make this a trully worthwhile way of exping, but the ability to do it is
there (again going with 'some' soloing ability).  An SK is second only to
Paladins (in my own experiece) at getting and keeping aggro.  A paladin,
however has less soloing potential I believe (again I do not know paladin
class that well, so take that with a grain of salt :) ).
