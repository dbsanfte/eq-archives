    Zoning is designed to clear regular aggro (the normal hate list) off a
mob. This is why in-zone evacs clear aggro. It isn't difficult to code
things such that aggro is NOT cleared by zoning. As an example, think of the
Rampage list of a mob. Even if someone on Rampage dies, when they come back
to the fight they'll be on the exact same position on the Rampage list as
before.

    Incorrect. As shown above, there exist hate lists (the Rampage list)
that are not cleared by zoning. This was intentional. Don't you remember the
issues from a while back when in-zone evacs weren't forcing a zone load and
thus weren't clearing aggro?

    It was before they fixed it. ;-) Ask a few of the older Beta players,
they can fill you in.

    That was implemented at the same time, for the same reason: player death
conditions could be checked before HPs from worn items and buffs were
applied.

    They've apparently fixed the "buffs being stripped" part - it was in a
patch message. I imagine it was fixed because players were using zone lines
to clear detrimental effects which should have killed them. I have not heard
of the "low health heal" part being changed, though, and the original
poster's story leads me to believe it's still in place.

    In the original examples, players were snaring one mob out of the bunch
that came, then zoning. The other mobs all walk back home, but the snared
one stays at the zone line. So when the player zones back in, he has a
single mob to kill of his choice. I was pointing out that this is used as a
pull tactic without the zoneline as well, by a class that can do all the
required parts (snare and clear aggro via Feign).
