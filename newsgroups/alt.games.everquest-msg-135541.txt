You misunderstand..  *I* don't believe that.  I simply asked if YOU
do.

I don't know how it is in your group, but in this one, the vast
majority of people believe that the girl with the short skirt is
partially responsible.  Hell, they don't even end it there.  As far as
the people in this group is concerned, the girl with the short skirt
is COMPLETELY responsible and she deserves it...

I have been fighting this attitude for over a year now.  It really
warms the cockles of my heart to hear it re-iterated from a completely
3rd party who is completely neutral on the matter.  

Most people in this group (Not all, that much is true) think it's
perfectly all right that my wife and daughter are attacked in the most
viscious, depraved and perverted manner.  They think it's justified
because *I* am an arrogant asshole..

Get that??  *I* am an arrogant asshole so they attack my wife and
daughter...    

Pure terroristic mentality...

As I said, don't get me wrong. I fully and 100% agree with you on this
point..  I just asked to prove a point to the jerks and assholes in
THIS group who feel that the girl with the short skirt deserves to be
raped, that the guy who leaves his car in a bad neighborhood DESERVES
to have it stolen.  


It's sad that people actually believe that...
