What's the point now? To challenge the next zone. To defeat the biggest 
encounters. To get gear upgrades to allow them to continue.

Nothing changes for raiders in the raid game.

Or are you saying the only reason people raid the Plane of Time is so 
they can go back and solo in Kael easier? So they can farm pp in Dulak 
faster? 

If so, yeah my 'nerf' will affect those people... and will remove the 
point of raiding for them... but I *highly* doubt anybody is in a 
highend uber raid guild so they can get gear upgrades they can use to 
farm dulak more efficiently.
