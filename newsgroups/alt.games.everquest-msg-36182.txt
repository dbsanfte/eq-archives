IMO: First priority is damage shield<O'Kiels?> all the tanks to let them
know you care. I've had people swear my magician damage shields were the
only really effective thing other then healing on red pulls. The tanks
couldn't hit them, the nukes were all resisted, only thing that consistantly
worked was mob being burned and the cleric/shaman/druid healing the tank.
