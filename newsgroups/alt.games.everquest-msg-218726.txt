[snipped]

With Satrika, I've been there once, for maybe an hour or so, tops.  With 
previous characters... a lot, but usually with characters that don't know 
Human or Elvish, so it's all gibberish to me.  :)

PC has crap loot anyway, unless you count the bandit loot, and who wants to 
fight for two camps?  Bugger that.

Satty did quite well enough in the Field of Bone and Kurn's Tower, 
thankyou.  :)
