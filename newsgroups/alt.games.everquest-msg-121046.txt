I tested my Cougar Claw Earring (Extended Range III) as soon
as I logged on yesterday, and by moving forward and back until
I found the "out of range/not out of range" point with and
without the earring, I personally calculated the 15% range 
enhancement before I read any of the websites about it.

And I was using the Paladin level 9 Cease spell to do it,
so clearly the "III" class focus item affects low-level spells.
At least in that case.
