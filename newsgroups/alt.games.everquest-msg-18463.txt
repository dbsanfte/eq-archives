Hi Folks,

I'm looking for European guilds on Vazaelle and Morell-Thule, or a US
guild that has Euro time friendly players. I play 20's characters on
each server and would like some regular friends to group with. I play
afternoons and early evenings GMT which makes grouping difficult.

I did join one guild on Vazaelle and they were an absolutely great
bunch of folks but alas all their raids, events etc. were in the
middle of the night for me as they were strictly US based and I was
the only European. 

I would like a guild with a mature outlook, I loathe d00ds, and ones
who place having fun, helping each other out on quests, exploring the
wonderful world of Norrath etc. first. I'm *not* looking for a power
gaming type of guild. A role-playing guild would be preferred but not
essential.

Any suggestions on guilds I should check out on Vaz and MT would be
much appreciated, with URL's to their web sites if they have one.

Thanks,

BB.
