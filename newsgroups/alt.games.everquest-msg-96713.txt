My Druid is in mourning for the passing of the Zelniaks into the light 
blue dimension... What other creatures are there that are as easy to kill 
for a druid, and will take me to 50 or so? Stonegrabbers and Rockhoppers 
have a mountain of HP, and bloodgills, while easy, are overcamped and a 
royal pain to pull (and besides, since I bought Luclin, I would like to 
get some mileage out of it =)

Any suggestions for nice, easy, safe Druid-fodder? Preferably nothing 
that appears civilized and is not KOS to me. I may be a Druid, but I have 
standards. =)
