Do you have a single reference that one single EQ account has been hacked
by the methods you describe?

Don't post about how the methods exist.

Don't post about how the methods have been used in other circumstances.

Post substative proof that this has happened, SPECIFICALLY IN EVERQUEST.

If you can't, kindly STFU and go pound sand up your ass.
