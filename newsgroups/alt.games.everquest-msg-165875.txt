Everquest is the first game I haven't been able to get to work as non-admin,
most other games - even those not "supporting" XP - was just a question of
allowing write access to directorys.

I wonder if it's the registry or something ...

I can't be satisfied with ending the discussion by saying it's "security
restrictions" - not unless I see an official note.
It might very well be that it just needs a couple of things done and then it
would work.

PS  Letting users be admins is not a solution, I'm using "XP home edition"
and I already play under an ordinary user account but start Everquest with
"Run as..." and then I run Everquest under the admin account.
