I've just returned to EQ f rom Dark Age of Camelot, and for no apparent good
reason I can find. DAOC corrected so many of the little annoyances that used
to bug me in EQ that I should have loved it, to wit:

1. No need for corpse recovery
2. Very little down time due to low mana/health
3. Non-repeatable quests
4. A real warrior-mage type class (Thane, there may be others)
5. A huge improvement in graphics
6. Fighting styles, so you don't have to just sit there and hit 'kick' or
'bash' once every few seconds
7. A tradeskill system you could actually make money with and didn't have to
be funded by the U.S. Treasury
8. I was actually able to get my favorite name (Flynn) on two of the servers
I was playing on.
   ... and a host of other things

So, answer me this: Why did I come back to Everquest? Why didn't DAOC light
my fire? Honestly, I don't know, but there was "something" missing and I
can't seem to put my finger on it.

Pardon me all if you've had this discussion before, but I have no idea how
to read old mail in a newsgroup, so flame away if I'm opening an old can of
worms. But I'd really like some answers.
