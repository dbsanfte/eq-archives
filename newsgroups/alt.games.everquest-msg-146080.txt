Actually it's the other way around...
I've 2-boxed a shaman and monk. Shaman buffs (sow, regen, haste, ac) and 
sits on his ass. Monk runs to pull, fights. Shaman assists the monk, 
stands up, turgurs, sits back down. That would be one button hit. When 
monk is low on hp, shaman stands up, heals, sits. That's another button.
If there are more people in the group, then I need to hit F2-6 and then 
stand-heal-sit button.
For the most time the shaman was controlled by a gamepad with 3 buttons 
programmed and a long cord, and his monitor was off
