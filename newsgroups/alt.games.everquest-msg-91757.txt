As you head into his room go to the far left corner invisible, pretty close
to him.  Stick around a few minutes and kill the roamers.  Most are probably
green to you but they're an annoyance that could quite possibly get you
killed.

Assuming "a few of us" are at least three 45+ you shouldn't have too many
problems.  He's a shaman with a pet (another annoyance) and does hit and
cast pretty hard.  The key to him is sparing no mana...kill him fast.  You
should be able to easily handle any roamers you missed before while you're
sitting their medding/healing up.
