Best way I have found is to make a hot key like this

/tell %t This is the fastest
/pause 12
/tell %t way I have found
/pause 12
/tell %t to level in language

Find someone to tell back and forth to you and set each others languages to
the one you want to learn. Target them then just keep hitting the button.
