  I'm not sure they didn't answer the question (that's why I added the "if true"
part).  I try to give people the benefit of the doubt and assume they're telling
the truth unless they're quite obviously assholes.  I can't recall any of Dirn's
other messages, I don't really pay much attention to who I'm talking to, but
rather what they're saying.  My news server sucks and I didn't get all of Dirn's
original message, but he seemed sensible and articulate enough in the quoted
portion of his message that I was able to read.
