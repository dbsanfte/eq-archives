Only non-profits and heavily regulated businesses like utility
monopolies and insurance companies justify their charges based
on expenses.  Ordinary businesses set their prices based on
internal business planning that takes into account a host of
factors including:  how much customers are willing to pay, how
much their competitors are charging, how easy it is for a new
competitor to enter the market, how well their product stands
out from competitors, how mature the market is, & etc.  SOE saw
DAoC charging $13 a month, noticed that their own customers
were fairly loyal to their distinctive product, and so raised
their fee to the newly established standard.
