I assume it's the program that's launched when you invoke
"Options" from the pre-login screen.  (EQ gives you a
popup saying it's launching a separate application.  What
I find annoying is that the options application hides that
popup, so it's not until I finish changing my options and
close that window that I suddenly see the popup.  It then
takes me a moment to realise that the popup is old news
and I should just click ok!)

Note: it wasn't clear from the original post whether he was
trying to run it standalone, or whether he's getting the
error when he invokes Options from inside EQ.
