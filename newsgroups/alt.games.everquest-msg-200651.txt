XP is *faster* in the planes, not easier.

You simply can not argue that a mob that hits for
500+ and has 15-20k hp is easier than mobs that hit
for 160+ and have 10k hp.  

Yes, there is a bigger bonus for the 61/62 mobs
in PoV versus the high 50's mobs in UP, but that
is more than offset by the requirement that you 
have a true tank and slower in your group.

I typically fight with my RL buddy and his in game
wife which gives us 65 ranger, 65 druid, 63 mage, 
and 65 'bot cleric.  If we add anything but a true
tank and slower to this group we're looking at 
massive downtime as the cleric has to chain heal
a ranger tank with 1300ac and about 4.5-4.7k hp.

Now, we have fought in PoN with this setup - but
they are high 50's and hit for mid 300's - still
twice as much damage to heal per minute as an 
equivalent UP mob.

If the ZEM's were the same in PoV and UP, then there's
no way we'd go to PoV, and no way in hell we'd go to PoN, 
only the faster xp brings us there with it's inherently 
greater difficulty, and limited class selections for our 
last 2 slots. Take that greater xp away, and there is no
incentive to go through the extra hassle to find such
specific classe.  Hell, the reason we started that bot
cleric was to relieve us of some of the need to find
a true healer (pre incomplete heal for druids).

No, given the same ZEM we'd simply grab the first 2 
friends we came across and head to UP and XP there where 
the ranger can tank easily.  Heck, my 61 air pet can tank 
those mobs.
