Thankfully, it's not *always* so, and there are lots of people working 
on it *not* being always so (the fact that there are still a handful of 
whales out there illustrates the fact). Obviously, if the conflicts were 
between animals alone and humans alone, the animals would not stand a 
chance (with the notable exception of fire ants, perhaps), but most of 
the time, conflicts between humans and animals involve humans on both 
sides.
