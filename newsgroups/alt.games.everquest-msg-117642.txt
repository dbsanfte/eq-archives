  I kinda gush about it.  I haven't played on Drinal since they did the languages
changes (the language barrier was a real deal-killer.  If I didn't want to talk to
other players, I would be playing a single user game).
  Anyways, I think that shaman is a good suggestion.  Focus on learning human, so you
stand a better chance of being able to communicate that you want to group.  Joining a
guild is also a good idea, even more so than on regular servers.  None of my Drinal
characters were in guilds for every long, and I had no problem finding groups.  It's
a different story on FV.
