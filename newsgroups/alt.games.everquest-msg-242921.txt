It's easy enough.  You just have to be KoS enough to the mobs you're 
fighting that they will attack you, despite your higher level.  Mob hits 
you, pet hits them.  Unfortunately, it's no longer generally possible for 
the pet to taunt the mob off you without you moving, as most mobs will 
continue to pound on you rather than the pet as long as you're in melee 
range.
