1) Just dinged level 12 tonight (thank Bertox for Meditate :-)  ), and
wondered
about stacking issues with my 9/15 spells.  Does Despair's ATK debuff stack
with Scream of Hate's ATK "Tap?"  Basically debuffing 2 levels of ATK off of
a
critter?

2) Are SK pets generally light-blue to green to the SK?  I've played a necro
before and would sometimes summon yellow pets at lower levels.

3) I know Fear has a maximum duration of 3 ticks, but how long does
Clinging Darkness hold? Not so much worried about the DoT component
as I am the snare component.  Is it comparable to druid Snare (level 5)?

4) Speaking of that DoT component, does Clinging Darkness' DoT stack with
the little DoT from level 9's Disease Cloud?

Thanks in advance for any tips, too.

I can't wait to fear kite...this is the first SK I've stuck it out with
until pet
levels.  Can't wait to start Tinkering, too...
;-)
