Donal's isn't what I had in mind.  Most of the minor pieces are shit.
Crap effects and no stats.

What exactly is wrong with GEBs and Splitpaws?
I never bought into that idiotic notion that clerics had to tank.  The
VAST majority of exp grind groups in pre-Kunark days when a cleri
tanked, the tank was doing a shitty job.

We don't give boots to WIS casters anymore and bracers to meleers for
this very reason.  If a plate bracer drops, it defaults to clerics.
If a chain boots drop it defaults to rogues/rangers.

CFEs are just screwed.
