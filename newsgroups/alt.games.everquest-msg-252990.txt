Go to Nedaria's Landing and take the Magus to Abysmal Sea. You can hop on
boats to the other GoD zones from there. I think.

(The Magus in Nedaria's Landing is the only one that will port you to
Abysmal)

Abysmal Sea is basically a city on a huge ship, and there are no hostile
mobs to worry about. (Its a Wayfarers' base)
