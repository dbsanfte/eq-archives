>Okay. I play a low level monk and was wondering. Since 2hb's generally have

Short answer....Train all of them. You will use all three skills at
the later levels base on the situations you find yourself in. 

Training weapons...

1HB = Figthing Baton 8/20 (Pretty cheap on most servers 200-400pp)
2HB = Bamboo Bo Stick 8/20 (100-200pp depending on server) Best to
start 2HB training after you get Double Attack at lvl15.
H2H = Any of the newer H2H weapons...Katars, Knuckles, ect with a
delay less than your base fist delay (4/36 at level 1)
