Interesting.  Bash, in my experience, has four possible results:
miss, hit for "normal" damage (with possibility of interrupt at end of
cast like any normal damage), hit for damage and instant interrupt,
and hit for damage/instant interrupt/stun.  Your test suggests that
the instant interrupt without stun is, perhaps, a zero duration stun
(although there is no stun message when it occurs), which Ogre stun
immunity protects them from.  If so then Ogres get an even better deal
than I thought.
