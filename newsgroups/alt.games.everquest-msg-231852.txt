   I'm sorry to hear that you're going to be out traveling, going to fun
sounding festivals, and hopefully making a ton of cash instead of being hunched
over a keyboard playing eq... wait a sec.  Ok, I'm sorry to hear that you
probably won't be able to do both!  You will be missed.  And when you come back,
likely Lenny and I will be able to LDoN with you!  Maybe.  

   Good luck, have fun, and know that you will be missed.
