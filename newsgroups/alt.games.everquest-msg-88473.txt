Yeah it be my ranger. Don't think I have harmony yet, have something
close but only effects one critter at a time, haven't used it much,
guess it's time I started. I cast this spell one time, forget it's
name off hand, and pissed off a wooly mammoth. I was after the calf
next to her. Think I made it to a guard on that one.

Need to figure this out trial and error I guess as I hope it'll be my
