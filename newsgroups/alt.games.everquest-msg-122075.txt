Look back a few days for a post by Dan. Same thing happened to a 
friend/guildie of his. As far as the GM's are concerned I feel for you. 
You might send them an email (response time with that will be slow 
anyway). As far as the moral dilemma? That's for you to decide.. but 
just think how you would feel if someone messed with your character 
(which just might happen).
