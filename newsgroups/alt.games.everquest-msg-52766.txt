You both do realize that the major upside to this is that if you can
learn to avoid death you don't pay a penalty?  In effect, its not a

group that has learned how to deal with a particular challenge.  Any
game that takes the "oh well, no worries" approach to death is missing
the fact that death is supposed to be avoided and in fact opens the door
