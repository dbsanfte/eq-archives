53 druid would be a piece of cake but I don't
think the place is worth the trouble.  Always
camped and usually a line to get in.  I waited
2 hours the other morning just to see what it
was all about and only came out with 750pp
2 hours later.

If you really want easy money with minimal work
I would suggest looking around in the bazaar and
seeing what tradeskill things are selling for a decent
price and go do some farming.  Or find yourself a
small group and go do Hill Giants.
Safety in numbers.
