So my best EQ friend is slogging away on her shawl quests, and
we get (for the fourth time) to where we need two whiskers
from the drakkal wolves in Great Divide.  Hopelessly green to
both of us (my little druid was hunting them for exp in his 20s)
we aren't looking forward to our chore, but oh well, gather four
and she AOE kites em as I bring more in, root em and have her
epic DOT em down.

After a couple rounds of this, I'm still FM and feeling frisky,
so I get out my new PBAOE, Unspoken Word.  At the
same time, to compare, I mem Upheaval.  I get in her travel
path and pop off UW, and get a couple of her mobs, very
clumsy.  As I suspected, the effects are disruptive, too, one
of them is blinded and wanders off, the second gets on me.

Well, undetered by this, once we get them on her again, I
set up upstream of her and get her moving in a straight line past
me (contrary to her normal course which involves circling
to maintain a tight cluster) and after a couple false starts
(duck cancelling spell when its clear its going to be too late
or too early) I get off upheaval with the full quartet on me.
What fun, 605 points each in a hurry.

Excited now, we gather 8 wolves and try it again, this time
I'm the sole damage.  Takes a bit of manuevering, but
I'm doing full damage to all 8, and I get them with UW
too, mostly dead wolves very rapidly.

Amazing low drop rate on whiskers, before we get our
second drop I've done this four more times, at the high end
chewing up 10 wolves at a time with UW for 7250 total
damage.

UW is, oddly, harder to get off right, I don't know if
it has a smaller area or what, but I had trouble lining
up that shot and gettting the full cluster of wolves,
while a miss with Upheaval was rare.  Its also more
disruptive, as random mobs are and aren't blinded,
and the blind ones path off different directions.  This meant
it was best used as the Kill shot rather than the workhorse,
dead wolves don't care if they are blind.

Lets see, what else.  Oh, I frequently got aggro from
some of the wolves as they arrived on top of me, timing
the spell so it would go off as they arrived, instead of
slightly slower so they were past me or around me worked
better as it gave them less time to interrupt me.  With
higher level mobs this would be more of a concern, as
the damage from a dozen blue to me mobs wouldn't
be as easy to shrug off.

Also, the kiting druid had some trouble getting them all
to follow her after my nukes, often one was completely
impossible to get on her.  With care I could arrange it
so "my" wolf's flight path was the same as hers, though,
or as often as not I'd root it out of the way and let her
epic DOT it.

Now I'm thinking of going to the Grey with a combination
of druids and clerics in order to use this plan on actual
exp mobs.  Both classes have the Upheaval spell, and there is
room to manuever and seemingly plenty of blue to me at
59 mobs to mass up and kill.
