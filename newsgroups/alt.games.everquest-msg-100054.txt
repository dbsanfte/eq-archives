Are you sure about this?  I'm a 38 Bard, so I only recently have received
this ability, but from what I can tell so far, it's by distance.  I had
never heard that Bard or Druid tracking is more limited than that of
Rangers, so this wasn't something I investigated "just to see".  It's just
what I noticed about the Bard's tracking ability.  I would watch it like a
hawk in OT when I received it (mostly to avoid those damn goons) while
waiting for groups, would compare mobs to the list.  I'm pretty sure it's by
distance.  I'll have to take another look.

Safe travels,
SEAN...
