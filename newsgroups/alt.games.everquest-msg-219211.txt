Thats a good point, only for melee classes of course, while I was
thinking about this sort of thing I was running my cleric mostly.

A 20/40 weapon with 20% haste (from any source) is better than a
20/32 weapon with no haste IF you are a class and high enough
level to get the extra damage bonus.

Of course at very low levels there's a damage cap, whereupon a
10/30 weapon is better than a 20/32 weapon
