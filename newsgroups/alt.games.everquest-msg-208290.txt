Seems that one aspect of the Chardok Quests did get changed when
Droga/Nurga were revamped. Warlord Skargus does not give the huge faction
hit (about 200 pts) that he used to.  Used to be if you had the faction to
trigger him that killing him would tip you over into Ally.  I was already
ally when he went down for me, but husband started and ended at Warmly (he
was the one who triggered Skargus, so he had to be at least 100pts into
Warmly).  

So...anyone here know if I have to be more than minimal Ally to turn in
the head to get the Regal Band of Bathezid?  We have to camp angry one
more time so we each have the ring, but I don't want to do it any more
than that.  Two SFs and two angry gobs in the same month is MORE camping
than I need for my entire life.
