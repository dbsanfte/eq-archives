Take:

One small brick of velium; three crystalline silks; and two glass
shards. Combine in pottery wheel.   Result is an unfired vial.

Take that unfired vial and combine in kiln with a HQ firing sheet.
Result is a fired vial.

Leave bank and turn right.   There will be three buildings on your
left at the bottom of the hill.   Go in the middle building (it's a
potion shop), ask that NPC "what velium vapors?"    Receive a
container.    Place fired vial and two small pieces of velium in
container and combine.

As with all tradeskills, none of the items should be stacked.   The
silks and velium can be obtained either in Velks or Crystal Caverns.
Note, you can only do this in Thurgadin unless you either carry the
container for the last combine around or have one in the bank.  So
it's a very good idea to make another one right after you use the
last one.   The portal spot is the "outside" end of the bridge into
Thurgadin, so it's safe to use the potion even if you're KoS.
