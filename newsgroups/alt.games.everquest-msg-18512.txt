If you're still using the mouse to click a spell gem to fire
a spell during "an important raid", you might be happy to learn
that you can also cast spell gem numbers 1-8 via the keyboard,
using alt-1 through alt-8.  This is *much* faster and more reliable
to cast in the middle of a big fight than trying to see your
mouse pointer in the middle of multiple spellcasting sparkles
and other clutter, then maneuvering it over to your spell gems
and testing your hand-eye coordination when time is of the essence.
