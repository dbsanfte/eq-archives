I would never have thought of that on my own. Thank you for reminding me that I wasn't browsing at a bookstore. Gosh. It's superhumans like you that are needed in life to remind pissants like me that things are and aren't what they appear to be. You may go back to camping an_Orc_Pawn_01 for the Fabled Crushbone Belt safe and secure in the knowledge that you have once again thwarted the forces of evil and ignorance in your pursuit of truth, justice and the Antonican way!
