Actually, I did go ahead and remove the pause and sit this weekend after
posting this. :) I never worry about aggro; I have the AC and HP to take it
with no problem, and can c heal through a beating. Usually I'm with tanks
who are good enough at hate to get the aggro back before it really becomes
an issue as well, but yes, it was becoming annoying to sit after a c heal,
since, although I've always been somewhat of a battle cleric, I've been
doing a lot more battling since I upgraded my weapon. Definitely good
advice; once upon a time, it was actually useful for me to auto sit after a
c heal, but now just isn't practical. :) I'd just been lazy in removing it.
