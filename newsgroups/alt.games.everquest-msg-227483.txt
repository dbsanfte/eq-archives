Hmmm. I see what your saying and you've got a point.

And I even inadvertantly recognized it, when I observed that it could 
never destabilize a server economy...and that is for precisely the 
reasons you mention.

At worst you could drive the price of essence emeralds into the ground, 
but on the whole the server economy would be uneffected, because you 
aren't generating new pp.

Now I think of it as a pp-accumulating cheat. Just as a cheat that 
allows me to pickpocket bazaar pcs would be  a pp-accumulating cheat, 
and again: not a pp-generating cheat.
