Actually, the Meditate button doesn't work at all until you
put at least one practice point into the Meditate skill once
you reach the appropriate level (i.e., the level where your
guild trainer allows you to put a practice point into it).

Prior to that, you can click the Meditate button all you want
on your spellbook screen, and it'll just pop right back out
without having done anything.

*After* you are of the appropriate level and have put at least
one practice point into it, you don't need to press the Meditate
button at all, it'll automatically set itself whenever you go to
your spellbook.  In fact, pressing it at that point will turn
it *off*.

So there's never ANY reason to "click the meditate button 3 or 4
million times".
