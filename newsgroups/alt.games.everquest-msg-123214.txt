It looks as if I'm going to be bullwhipped into getting my wizard's
baking up to 250 eventually. 
/sigh

So as to stats for optimizing my chances at skill-ups...  My only
experience in this was my troll doing smithing. I went with Wis and STR
for practicing.

To do baking, my wizard has a standing unbuffed INT of 207. If I get a
couple of chanter buffs on me, I can boost that up a bit higher, but is
it worth it? Has it been shown that extra INT over 200 gives additional
bonus to a chance for a skillup?

When smithing, I read that STR was an important "secondary" skill to
keep maxed while practicing. Is there a secondary skill I need to be
aware of and buff up to practice baking?

My baking is only 143 currently, but it looks like I will be trying to
prepare the stuff to do creamy fillets and Halas 10 lb. meat pies. I'd
like to max my chances while I work towards a relapse of carpal tunnel.
