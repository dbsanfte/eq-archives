No, not mistken, even when guilded I couldnt get my epic. It was/is a 
recurring problem in that particular guild. While i *couldn't*  use my 
accumulated raid points to call a fight for an epic part, anybody can 
announce trying to get a group in guild chat....and as I dont work, I am 
in game anywhere fom 4 to 16 hours a day, depending on what i am doing 
IRL...I in general always answered when they needed a group...but most 
people never managed to get groups. FREX, my guild wouldnt help me with 
Burgurgle [this was back when I was 48] yet a 58 palle and I did him in 
45 minutes without any druids pulling the tower for their quest part. He 
wasnt in my guild at that time. Yet the 64 shammy who was also regularly 
in game at the same time couldnt pry himself away from POP planes for 
les than an hour to help a cleric get part of the clicky stick....or 
that 56 SK... or that 52 BL. All people in game regularly and generally 
LFG when I and others were trying to get epics proceeded upon.

Cant calculate the number of epics I have actually helped people get. 
Done 14 or 15 ringwars, helped total strangers with shardwurms/giant 
heads, toes/ wolf whiskers, miscellaneous drops...in or out of guild.
When I play, I want to be doing something, not just sitting there doing 
tradeskills...though I make serious money on the 2 vendors my hunting 
buddy and I keep in bazaar with certain tradeskill subcombines, or 
drops. We offer a package deal on arctic wyvern armor kits, stacks of 
tempers, oils, hides, velium that are very popular and profitable for 
us...but that is because instead of whinging about not getting a group, 
I will go farm CC for velium, or CS for cod and my druid buddy gets the 
wyverns and kites them around me while i either fisn or do mortar 
combines on celestials...

>>So here i sit, scepter and first orb in hand...patiently waiting.

Yup, and all 4 shards...my favorite spot for the shards is just inside 
SS by the BW zonein. They seem to drop fairly well there, about a month 
for all 4. I got as much of my epic done as I could with myself and my 
california hunting partner. It sucks that we get so little time to 
play...but my german game husband I see even less especially since he 
started his new job that sends him off to different places for up to a 
week at a time=(

Actually, on my ranger, at 29 I have all the foraged bits, and a few 
other goodies ready for when I hit 46=) and my relatively baby SK 
already has a fair amont of stuff as well. And my baby wizzie has the 
belt off Ixiblat because when we finally killed him, nobody wanted it =p 
now THAT is twinking [lol, a 10th level wizzie with a drop from an epic 
mob=)]

Aru

actually, I have 2 accounts, and every character on them except for 1 
monk belonging to my RL hubby are all me=) keeps me from getting bored. 
I can get through the uninteresting 1-10 levels in 2 castings of 
temperence and the Pit in SharVal and baby end Paludal...then I get to 
the fun parts of 10-30 ...the development years =) I get the biggest 
thrill out of a simple little skill up in offense, or defense, or 
kick/bash - something you dont get a lot of at upper levels unless you 
are doing trade skills. Did you know that the exterminator by the neriac 
commons bridge hits like a little girl....and has a zillion HP? My SK 
friend was hitting on him and invited me to sneak in and max out my 
weapons skills on him=) He kept agro and I hit onthat DE until my 
characters arms were ready to fall off...you just pull him down onto the 
little sandy beach sort of under the bridge and the guards ignore his 
pitiful whines=)
