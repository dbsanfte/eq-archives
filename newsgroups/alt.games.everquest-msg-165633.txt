Then obviously you'remissing what I'm saying: The long camp sessions
are part of the price for the item. You don't want to sit through it,
you don't need the item. There is no item that you NEED that involves
a long camp session. Sure, JBoots are handy, but far from necissary.
Hell, they're not even half of what they're cracked up to be....
