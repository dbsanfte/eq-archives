Well, I was more fortunate in finding a actual etymology here: www.m-w.com.
Sadly I can't copy the direct link to it so I copy&paste it here. You
should be able to look it up yourself. It is the second entry for pussy.
The first one refers to the cat.

Main Entry: pusï¿½sy

Pronunciation: 'pu-sE
Function: noun
Inflected Form(s): plural pussies
Etymology: perhaps of Low German or Scandinavian origin; akin to Old
   Norse puss pocket, pouch, Low German puse vulva, Old English
   pusa bag
1 usually vulgar : VULVA
2 a usually vulgar : SEXUAL INTERCOURSE b usually vulgar : the female
     partner in sexual intercourse

Have fun with this. I find the whole argument rather amusing but think
the suspension was justified.



it was used for coward, what you've quoted here does not provide an
etymology for that usage of the word in this way.

As an aside, it seems that m-w have pulled that etymology for the definition
you have provided from later editions, or at least that is what is being
said at wordsmiths.  Not having a more recent copy of mw, I can't check
whether it was - but obviously at the time they were not certain.
