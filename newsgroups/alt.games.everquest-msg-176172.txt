The way I understand it, is each mob has a "hate list"... some actions
effect how "close to the top" of the list you'll be at.  Taunting pushes you
there quickly, but unless you continue to "anger" it, then you'll slip down
the list.

When I am the MT I taunt continuiously, and if not MT, then only if a
healer/caster gets aggro.
