Of course it would have... but it wouldn't have worked all that well.  The 
amount of capital you'd have to invest would be rather high, and it's 
rate-limited by the huge amount of mana required.  And the merchant 
buyback price for uncombined enchanted bars is a little less than the 
purchase price of the raw bar, so you only show a profit the 15% of the 
time the item actually works.  I think ultimately it would only made a 
real differece if you actually intended to use the enchanted bars yourself 
(as I would have), or sell them to players who would use them.
