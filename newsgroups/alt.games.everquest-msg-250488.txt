I don't think SOE would be getting money themselves, the wording was
something like "facillitate" which would just mean to aid players in
making the transfer via some secure screen or something. It probably
would not be anymore overhead on their end then the system they
already have in place to take credit card numbers for verifying your
next months subscription. Its automatic, as opposed to being done by a
person.

I don't think they'd be adjusting or manipulating the market either. I
think they'd just be putting in a place where you could enter into the
transaction with bob for a Lodizal shield which bob has for 10 bucks
because you both selected the amount "10 bucks." 

Granted SOE did not explain this, but I seriously doubt if THEY'D be
setting the prices. That would be a lot of work. In this case beyond
just setting up the secure method, they'd be doing no work at all.
