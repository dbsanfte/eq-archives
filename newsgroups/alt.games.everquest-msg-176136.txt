Magic items or buffs. Shamans and beastlords can give DEX buffs which will
give a temporary but substantial DEX boost. Bards have a song which does
the same (but must be played continuously, so is less useful if you're
not grouped with the bard.) Don't think any other classes have DEX buffs
other than self-only stuff like the Yaulp series.
