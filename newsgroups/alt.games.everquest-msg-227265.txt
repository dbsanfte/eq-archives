If you're talking about large raid encounters, you're probably right. 
However, in that case you're more often playing with people in whose 
success you have a vested interest. In xp groups, you should see enough 
random wins to keep it interesting.

It's got nothing to do with abuse. If you get a weapon better than the 
one you're using, you're gonna go sell your old one at some point. Of 
course, when you're dealing with elemental drops and such, the guild may 
well have strict guidelines about handing down gear.

Gotta love it when people are forced to deal with the consequences of 
their actions.
