No.  He earned the money to by the item.  He didnt earn the item in game
terms.

Gogo generalisations.  What if the guy is stealing so he can buy in game
items? He earned them then? What if he inherited his cash, then bought
items, guess he earned them then too.

Problem is earning something in RL has nothing or should have nothing to do
with earning something in a game.

Yes, the guy who camped for 16hours earned it, the guy who bought it did not
earn it, he got some money and bought it off somebody who DID earn it, in
the context of the game.
