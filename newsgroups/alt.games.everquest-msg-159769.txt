www.lokari.net has an excellent tailoring guide.
www.eqtraders.com has excellent info on tailoring and all the other
tradeskills.

Large sewing kit should work identically to the small one, except that you
can use it to also make recipes that require up to 8 items in one combine.
There are also standalone looms which are 10 slot for the really big
recipes.  You may be able to find someone selling a Deluxe Sewing Kit, those
are 10 slot as well, but are not longer available in game, except from other
players.  The message that says you cannot combine means that you are trying
an invalid recipe, the recipes should be identical for the large and small
kits.
