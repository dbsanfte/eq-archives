I still view it as a result. The maxim 'all other people are equal' is 
supported by the axiom, while the 'all other people are better than me' 
is rapidly rejected by any rational person. [note that all other people 
are "worse" than me' is equivalent to the "better" version due to the 
way it would be applied universally.]

As I mentioned in the other post. The ability to support different 
desires is also supported by the axiom. The idea that 'I think people 
should treat me the way I want to be treated' works as a universal 
maxim... and that clearly allows people to desire different things.

Not really. Its not much of a 'blanket' to say that a subset of a set is 
within the set. A 'blanket' to me should cover more than a single 
logical tautololgy. :)

Consider that I've seen it go 'oh so terribly bad'. And though sometimes 
it may be 'good', I don't see that its worth it. Sometimes you have to 
take the bad with the good... sometimes its worth forgoeing the good to 
stave off the bad. Sort of like capital punishment... sometimes its 
good... but executing an innocent is so very bad it calls the whole 
precept into question.
