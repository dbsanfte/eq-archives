You should have 2 shift keys on your keyboard, one in the bottom-left 
corner, and one about 2/5 of the way in from the bottom-right corner.  They 
will go a long way in helping you capitalize the word "I" and the first 
letter of each sentence.

Punctuation will be important in communication when you get older.  You 
should practice it now.  It's your friend.

"Plz" doesn't spell anything.  "Please" does, however.

Mr. Helpful says: "Save early, save often."

The normal Everquest requires that you register your copy of Everquest with 
your credit card.  The game comes with a serial number, or account key.  If 
your "mag" copy doesn't have one, then read whatever instructions are in 
the "mag" or on the CD.
