Ok. You claim you saw an article which you can't produce, written by 
someone you didn't name, on a date you neglect to mention. And that's 
supposed to be better than the anoymous sources the other guy cites? Yet 
I'm supposed to call that 'uncredible' and this 'HARD DATA'?

I don't think so.

> In general the guy from mmogchart cannot provide a *single*
> hard fact or reviewable source for his numbers for EQ.

Neither did you! He says he looks at press releases, talks to insiders, 
looks at financials, none of which he reproduced. He obviously does this 
as a hobby, and has produced a website on the subject for many months. 
For what its worth, his numbers are generally accepted to be in the 
right ballparks by most obververs. And what little HARD information is 
out there has been incorporated.

Meanhwhile, you claim you looked at one article on the web, on a 
tangential subject which you also can't produce. ... yet you think your 
credibility should be higher.

> Up to you ,what you make out of it,for me his credibility is zero.

What do I make out of it? What CAN I make out of it. You've given me 
nothing solid to work with.

Can you even demonstrate with any certainty WHEN this article got 
written? (not when you SAW it) Before, during, or after the server 
merges? Because if it was before, then the number of players for each 
server is effectively doubled. In my world when they merge two 10k 
servers they end up with one 20k server.

Second, your so-called hard data contains exactly 2 numbers. 10k per 
server, and 21 servers. One of them is trvially verifiable: 21 
servers... and dude, you didn't even get THAT right.

There are 25 servers. (24 live + 1 test) Count them yourself if you 
don't beleive me.
