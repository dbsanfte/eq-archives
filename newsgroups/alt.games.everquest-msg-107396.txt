Well... with lesser succor or Succor AND a CoH mage, seems it may be
possible to do this. But generally we still wind up sitting around and
everytime we think we are ready to go, seems someone needs a port from some
place far away.

Take Chardok raid for example. Entrance and the fort are taken, so no place
we can fight much of anything. We are about ready to go when a rogue and a
cleric call on the raid channel that they are coming, but one is in GD and
another in Tox. I head out to port them, but then I also have to walk them
all the way from skyfire to Chardok, because they can't invs (well the
cleric can't) past the guards at the fort in BW. SO I have to kill 10-15
minutes getting them porting to BW and escorting them to the fort.

Major Suckage.
