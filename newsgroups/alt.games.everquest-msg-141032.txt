}Recently started some new characters to join a friend who has returned to
}the game. One is an Iksar so I have been trying to work on some faction in
}Qeynos (Probably the easiest of the cities to do this in) Killing Gnolls and
}Bandits and doing appropriate hand ins of fangs, moonstones and sashes.
}Starting fully KoS with everyone I took some advice and cheated with Wolf
}Form, things seemed to be going fine but what I didn't realise is that my
}faction in Wolf Form is totally different from my faction out of it. This
}does make sense but when I suggested this was the case, to a couple of
}people, I was told categorically NO it wasn't.

Wolf form (or any other illusion) basically changes your race for faction 
purposes.  Your faction with an NPC depends on race, class, religion, and 
things you have done to change that faction.  So if you go to wolf form, 
and that NPC likes puppies, your faction goes up a ways, and that will 
allow you to do handins you might not otherwise be able to do.  Most NPCs 
in he old world prefer a cazic thule worshipping wolf monk to a lizard 
one.  It's much less likely to work on any expansion continent though.

}Case in point, in Wolf Form I am now upto Amiable (from Dubious) to the
}Priests of Life and Knights of Thunder...out of it they still Scowl at me (I
}have now raised it upto threatening after managing to hand in several
}moonstones in my natural state) Capt Tillin views me as Kindly in Wolf Form
}but Dubious out of it.

Faction levels are of different widths.  Scowling is a very wide range. If 
you're 1600 points into scowling, and wolf form makes you +2000 points, 
that'll put you at about the bottom of dubious.  If you go up another 
800 points, in normal form you're still 800 points into scowling, but in 
wolf form you'll be amiable. (Note: all numbers pulled out of my ass.  But 
you get the idea. I think there's a chart somewhere... :) Actually, I've 
seen about 3 different charts, ad they're similar, but have unresolved 
differences.)

}Has this always been the case, that Wolf Form faction is different to
}normal?

No, there are some NPCs for which it will turn out that your faction in 
wolf form is exactly the same as for your base class.
