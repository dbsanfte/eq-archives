Yes, Dan, but some of us like going to car dealerships that have a good, no
haggle price.

Personally, I abhor EC, I avoid it like the plague, I give away my equipment
to friends and guildies.  The only thing I sell is SoW potions, and I sell
them for a bit less than the standard going price so that they move fast.

If you enjoy it, more power to you, have fun, but not everyone does.
