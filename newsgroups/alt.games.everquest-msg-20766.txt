    Uh, then WHY did you bother me in the first place?*
    Welcome to my "charge double" list.

    Sure, after you transfer 75 plat to me.

* What is it with these types of people that after they've screwed you, or
tried to screw you that they feel compelled to say the words "it's okay?"
What they found some way to do whatever it was they wanted you to bend over
backward to do for (or sell to) them, without using you, so it makes what
okay?  That they've taken up your time?  Or that you tell them to pound
sand?
    "It's okay, I got someone to port me for free."
    "It's not okay, because you had me take time away from getting exp, to
port all over the damn realm to try and get you, and then you can't be
bothered to be in the right place <insert recounting of rest of story>.  You
still owe me for the port, since I did the work.  If you don't come pay me
now, I'll tack it on to your next invoice, with interest, and your credit
rating will require me to charge you a higher processing fee, and require
payment for work IN ADVANCE, no exceptions."
    "You're mean" (typicall response)
    "Boats are free."  or "Why don't you just call your bro to port you
then, and leave me alone?"
