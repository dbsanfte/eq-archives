Yep, pretty much the same thing, I was splitting hairs to make sure my

I have grouped with plate tanks, warriors included, who can hold aggro 
off me, or at least grab it back fairly quickly.  Thats an excellent 
combo; we get my full utility without having to cope with my chain class 
AC and HP.  While I still end up getting slapped around a few times per 
fight, that just lets my regen contribute.

But I'm worried more about what is going to happen when I'm facing the 
unstunnable mobs prevalent in the high end of the game; my utility is 
probably 90% about the stuns, since there's no mana cost I can chain 
stun for hours on end (chain in this case being 4 seconds of every 12 
due to refresh, so its not constant stun by any means), and since the 
stun is instant, I can interupt even the shortest cast spells on demand 
(but not all spells, due again to the 12 second refresh).  If the mob 
can't be stunned, I can... well I can snare it maybe, but so can half 
the classes in the game it seems like.

Even with a warrior who couldn't hold aggro off me at first, I was able 
to work out a rythm where I could pretty much go wild; it just came down 
to him holding taunt till he lost aggro, and grabbing it back with a 
button press, and to me getting my frenzy and stun together so I had a 
high aggro spike which he could then taunt off me, rather than keeping 
them seperate in an attempt to keep from getting hit ever.

I guess when the mobs start hitting so hard that I can't suck up a round 
or three I'll have to work the other direction; keeping my head down at 
all times and only sneaking stuns in when I see the warrior's proc go 
off... dunno, I'm not there yet, so far I've yet to face any mob that I 
couldn't tank for at least long enough to slap a couple jolt axes in at 
it ( which means at least 12 seconds, assuming one is available NOW, but 
more likely 24 seconds, cause I probably got aggro from a stun which 
means 12 seconds for the first jolt to come available)
