Its not that I don't trust people (when I got scammed as a relative noob, it
really dented my trust in people, but you live and learn..)  I take a big
interest in my community though, and if that means being pedantic, or
conjuring up bizare/unlikely scenarios to test out something.. well so be it
:)

Its still a potential 3 hour needless delay though... if so many rages
really are killed within 20 minutes, then perhaps a more realistic figure
would be 1 hour?

Well the mobs have a lot of HP, and hit quite hard.. so for the average
group, its definately not a good exp place.   It IS an exp place though
(heck its also a death trap if your unlucky)

I lived with calendars and rotations for a long long time, but I could never
go back to them now.

Ok well, lets use me as a hypothetical example (I do have a 60 non epic
cleric)
My 3 day Rage period happens to be a Friday-Saturday-Sunday.. as a result I
book the Friday off work.  Suddenly the asshole infront of me decides he
can't be bothered to attend his rage (why is it a big deal, when you know
your still guaranteed first on the list)

Not only does it put me behind, but it puts me in a camp for 3 whole days
that I have work (as opposed to 1 day, which is easily booked off).

Account sharing is *NOT* an option... so what happens to me then?

Well, the most powerful guild set all the rules
The most powerful guild decided WHAT would be rotated - we had no control or
say in it
The most powerful guild decided when to allow concessions to certain
guilds - blatant biasm

The system was corrupt (maybe not alwys intentionally.. but it was without
doubt) certain "unpopular" guilds were restricted or severely delayed from
joining rotations, whilst friends and allies faced little difficulties.

Well whats wrong with saying, "were raiding tonight at 8pm! Check guildmotd
for more info"

PoF is already clear?  Go check PoH then..  Kael.. WW.. DN.. PoG.. HoT..
Icewell etc (thats just velious alternatives)
Or is diversity a bad thing nowadays?

Well I doubt Prexus will ever go back to being lists, calendars and
rotations.   Ask the competition? if only :)  As for planting a spy in
guilds.. well as sad is it sounds, this isn't as uncommon as people may
think... saying that though, its probably a common thing on *all* fcfs
servers.

What is rotation/calendar/reserved on MT?

Or if clerics did what every other class does... when I needed my monks epic
pipes, I didn't stay in Karnors and Chardok until I got them, I didn't go a
week without sleep (like some people in the SolB rage camps did)  I did the
normal decent thing... I camped it at normal times, and if it didn't pop...
oh well, maybe tomorrow?

Im not ANTI calendars... my posts may indicate that, but I was always fairly
indifferent to FCFS/reservations.  After the Prexus changes tho, getting
attacked day in day out... well you become kinda defensive

Why isn't phinny on a list?  For a mage/wizard, this mob can be an even
bigger headache than Ragefire.. who decides which mobs will and won't be on
a list?

> while they rezed up down under the ledge.  Was FCFS, but

We had 2 days ago a guild was ready before us (tho we formed together).. we
moved back, they tried, wiped.. we rezzed them.

This time they moved back, let us take a try (nothing more painfull then
wiping at 0.0001% heh)

They rezzed us back in.. this time we just helped them kill the thing...
Unfortunately things like this are quite rare nowadays... I guess its just
like modern day society, generally not a nice place at all.

Would love to know how you even guestimate a list like this :)  As a cleric,
you  would almost never (if ever) group with another cleric... similar to 2
enchanters.  How do you see how they really are and act in group?

Well I do have a 60 cleric, I've also grouped with a huuuuge variety of
clerics, and seen absolutely massive discrepencies in loot/gem dealing
between the various ones...
