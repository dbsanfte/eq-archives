They won't buy it, its useless now.

That is correct, its bound to your account.

No, the cdkey is bound to that account. The cds are now pretty
coasters that say everquest on them, in a pretty gold tin box. Since
the thing costs like 65 bucks retail, you may be able to sell it to
someone who never got the gold box for like 15 bucks, if you were
lucky. The actual software is useless though as it can't be used,
they'd simply have extra CD roms and the box and stuff.

Some people sell the characters on ebay, the entire account, this is
also not endorsed by Sony though its possbile (if they get caught the
account is banned) 

People also might be selling copies they legitimately bought on sale
or got in some good deal, perhaps figuring foreign people who have
trouble getting the software might buy it.

Tied forever to the account. The account is worthless also unless
it has a level 60 or above fully geared out character on it. It might
then be sellable for 65 bucks or more.

Sure, have fund with the costers/backup copies.
