Mage or Druid, plus Call of Earth, plus potion, plus bard DS song, all 
stack, there are some other buffs that also stack; my SK has an belt 
with clicky Thistlecoat that does, also items with actual DS directly on 
them (as opposed to clicky) and so on.

The big numbers, though, come from the Mage/druid DS plus potion, all 
the other DS that I've found are relatively small boosts.  Further, you 
can't really benefit from bard DS when PLing, because if there's a high 
level bard grouped with you, you won't be getting any exp at all.  Some 
other sources for DS are also short duration, and so not too useful, the 
reason I include COE is that it has a very long duration.  Its not very 
large though, if I have to forgo it, no big deal.

I thought the idea was to get sufficient faction for the rewards, and 
then burn the faction afterwards.  Would there be a reason to maintain 
the faction, say something that has charges but can be recharged?

I find the combinations of faction and quests and hot zones to be one of 
the biggest nuisances of EQ; I've avoided as much as possible doing any 
of the zones which negatively affect the overthere outpost faction, 
because I find the outpost very handy for banking and selling with my 
Worker's Sledgemallet.  I could live with bad faction there, but I'd 
just as soon not have to; so seeing hot zones in places like KC, seeing 
epic fights needing Howling Stones, and so on, really annoy me.

Similarly, POG is very annoying, killing faction needed by several 
classes to complete their epics, or requiring that they sit out raids 
that the guild is going on.  Sleeper's Tomb requires killing dragons, 
which is a bad thing if you're on dragon faction; again, potentially 
guild splitting stuff there, if you're into that sort of thing.

Later expansions didn't put nearly as much critical divisive faction 
material in, a much better choice IMO (of course POP substituted other 
even more divisive "features" but thats another matter)
