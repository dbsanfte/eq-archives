You suspect wrong. 

The GoD-specific magus doesn't require the adventure stone, which is 
consistent with SoEs strategy of NEVER requiring you to have a previous 
expansion to access a subsequent one. ie... you can buy the original 
everquest and ANY one expansion and rest assured you'll be able to reach 
it.

No. You do need to use a magus, but its not an 'LDoN magus' its a 'GoD 
magus'. That is why there are two magi in Nedaria's Landing, one 
connects to the ldon ring, and one connects to natimbi/abysmal. The one 
connected to the ldon requires the adventure stone, the other does not.
