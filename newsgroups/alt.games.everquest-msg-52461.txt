Well I'd agree that it would be nice if Verant would use these logs but
that's a lot of info(text) to go thru. Run a log on an hours play then view
it back and try to find a specific event, a good critical hit or something
(yes, you'll do it but it'll not be easy) now consider how many players in
that zone and all the trading combat  and conversations are going on at the
time. It can be done but it's not something that is like to take just 5 mins
of the GMs time.
I once sold a Mith 2hder to a Merchant (bought it back for 500pp) I also
have lost items I was carrying in a dimension pocket (worth close to 1k at
the time) when I was mid 20's this was a lot of plat. I learnt to be more
careful (and not use Dimension pockets) and make sure I was fully awake
before selling to merchants :ï¿½)
I never trade with Bags (asking for trouble) or trust anyone out there to
hold items or come back with their higher level character and hand over that
FBSS.
There are always MoTD warnings on Bristlebane about not trusting others but
every night someone cries about it in EC.
Would you trust someone to get their friend to deliver a car you just paid
up front for? I have spent a lot of time in EC and have never been scammed
but there have had plenty of attempts. If Verant clamped down on this it
would help but if people just showed some common sense sometimes lost items
would not be such a problem.
