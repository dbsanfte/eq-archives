There seems to be absolutely no problem with lag due to distance playing 
on the east coast servers in the UK. Or on the west coast servers for 
that matter. Lasy night playing in Antonica I didn't get any lag at all. 
In graystone I got some lag, but that seems to be all client side lag 
when the zone has a lot of people in it. I get a great deal less lag 
there on my laptop than on my other computer which wouldn't happen if 
the lag was server or latency based. (It's still perfectly playable with 
lag in that zone as you won't be fighting there)
