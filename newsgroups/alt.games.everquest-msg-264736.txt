I've noticed with myself and with friends that we have developed a set of
MMORPGs that we might stop playing for a while, but we come back to.  For me
that set is CoH and DAoC.  We'll pause CoH and DAoC again when WoW comes
out, and maybe for EQ2, but we have no doubt we'll be back.  (Actually,
we'll probably pause CoH, and just DAoC down to maybe once a week going into
the battlegrounds, plus the occasional work on our mains).

I think the game companies need to cater to people like us.  CoH fits in
well with this style of play because of the variety of powers, and how early
you get them.  We can come back to CoH, try some new class, and be doing
interesting stuff quickly.

DAoC fits will in with this style of play, too.  We can come back, pick a
server and realm that has good leveling bonuses, create new characters,
/level to 20, and then take advantages of the bonuses to get to 24 in a few
hours /played, and a few days real time, and be decently equiped for the
popular 20-24 battleground.

EQ1 is a little too slow at the low levels for this.  From what I've seen of
EQ2, however, it is fast enough.
