    It's tough. Imagine a laggy zone, lots of waterways, nobody to group
with, no "loot item" drops, lots of frogs with SoW, and no real ability to
"zone pull" and you have the Swamp. Even the Iksar hate it, although they
hate it after having to do quests there.

    I got level 34 and 35 in Dog Temple in FV (the long hallway filled with
Drolvargs that leads to an open area crawling with Drolvargs), and the
lowest dogs were just turning green when I left. This is just post-Kunark,
so there'll be more to kill that gives XP now. There were a ton of mobs to
pull, the drops (gems, ruined scale armour, bronze armour, fine steel) were
quite plentiful, but you have to be very careful pulling - mobs can fall
down through the walls of the hallway, like the pit in FoB, and start
beating you up from under the world. The Ancient Jarsath can also path by
the front door area, and he'd wipe the entire group if he aggro'ed. I wish I
could remember what level my monk was when he was going for the head of the
NPC that wanders around there - we pulled to Swamp zone for a bit, and it
was fun.

    The apes in Warslik's Woods are awesome for a soloist. Go to the caves
leading to Dalnir and you'll find two caverns, one with two apes and the
other with three. The apes are level 22 to 24 (roughly), non-social,
non-KOS, and easy to kill. They also have VERY good cash drops for a mob of
their level - you'll come out with piles of gems and cash-jewelry. The spawn
rate is fast enough that even at level 30, my twink shaman was just clearing
both caves and keeping pace with respawns.

    Kurn's is a waste by 24. The only place I can remember for someone to
hunt would maybe be the basement, and that place is a nightmare unless
you're pulling mobs way the hell away from it to fight. Imagine a fairly
dense mob spawn, lots of mobs that harm touch and heal nearby mobs, and lots
of mobs that like to run and you have the basement.

    If he has friends to form a group with he might want to try out front of
Droga, or Nurga, or one of the goblin mines in FM once he gets around 30.
There's a ton of camps like that in Frontier Mountains (the sarnak
encampment is another) which are never pulled by anyone and would be nice,
quiet places to level. He could also try the front of Nurga (you can swim up
the waterfall near zone, allowing you to fight stuff deeper in and still be
able to run to zone), but it's still Bring Your Own Group.
