Ehh, somebody's tormenting you, I've never seen one sold in EC for under 14k
lately (past 2 months), and the last person I know who bought one paid 16k
for his. (on Tarew Marr)  I even saw some guy trading his fungi for one, but
with no takers at the time, heh, this being back before the "nerf" drove up
prices again from ~17k to now about ~24k.

Granted, my prices are coming mostly from weekends with more prospective
buyers/sellers, prices might differ in the middle of the week a bit from
desperate sellers (I only need 5k more to buy my horse!)  or buyers (I've
been trying to get my fungi for 3 months!)
