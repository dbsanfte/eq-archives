I'll try to make a long story short.  My iksar monk and a friend were playing
in FOB.  This anonymous guy does a /ooc "what do you do with the pup skins?" so
i explain the quest.  A little later we run into him at the newbie ramp along
with several other people.  He had a great looking robe on I THOUGHT. Next
thing  he's naked and asking for freebies.  So I told him, Didn't I just see
you in a great robe?  He says no.. he's level 4 and has nothing.  So we run to
the bank and give him some spare cheapo armor, curscale and rhino hide stuff.  
Then he tells us he's a SK - cant wear any of it.  But can he keep it to sell? 
whatever - at this point we just want him to go away.  Next thing we know we
pass him and he's got the great looking robe back on.  He proceeds to admit
that he deceives people to get free stuff - then logs off quickly.  Next thing
I know I get a tell from the same guy, different character.  Only now he's not
anonymous and this character's  part of a guild.  Wants to know if he can come
hunt with us since this character is the same level as we are.  HUH?????
*I* think he's a JERK and *I* think we should turn him into his guildmaster -
would YOU want that kind of guy running around in YOUR guild?  
My partner says let it go... 
Would like YOUR opinions...
