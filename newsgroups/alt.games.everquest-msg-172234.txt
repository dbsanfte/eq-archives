I wonder if it will ever rain again? If it does then you will know that =
you are not in the end times and then I will stop. I don't care if it =
rains in another part of the world, just where I live and can see with =
my own eyes.=20

Revelations 11: 3-14

    3) And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall =
prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in =
sackcloth.

    4) These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing =
before the God of the earth.

    5) And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their =
mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he =
must in this manner be killed.

    6) These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of =
their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to =
smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.

    7) And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that =
ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and =
shall overcome them, and kill them.

    8) And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, =
which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where our Lord was =
crucified.=20

    9) And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall =
see their dead bodies three days and a half, and shall not suffer their =
dead bodies to be put in graves.

    10) And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and =
make merry, and shall send gifts to one another; because these two =
prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.=20

    11) And after three days and an half the spirit of life from God =
entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell =
upon them which saw them.=20

    12) And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come =
up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies =
beheld them.=20

    13) And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth =
part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven =
thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of =
heaven.

    14) The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh =
quickly.

Have a nice day. The first plague is over, the second plague shall now =
begin.
