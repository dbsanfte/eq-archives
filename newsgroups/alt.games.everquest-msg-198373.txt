As a shaman, I went ahead and dinged on up to 61, with only a brief pause 
prior to that for run 3, at 61, I have been splitting the xp, mostly going 
to AA.  I have seen no change at all in where I go to solo for AAXP, it's 
still the same mobs in PoN.  For grouping, the options are still the same 
as at 60, I never did PoJ for xp anyway.  The only PoN mobs that have gone 
light blue to me are the young bats.
