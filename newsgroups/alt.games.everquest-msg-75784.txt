Hi all..took up baking (well trying to), but can't seem to get it to work.
Have mixing bowl and when trying to make either batwing crunchies (batwing
and frosting) or fish rolls (fresh fish and batwing), I get a "can't combine
items of that type in this container"?  I have even put at least 5 points
into the skill (actually I think 10, but can't remember if I did when lvl 1
or not).  What gives?  What am I missing.  According to all sites, I should
be able to at least try the above, but the mixing bowl won't mix.  Any help
greatly appreciated....thanks...Bill
