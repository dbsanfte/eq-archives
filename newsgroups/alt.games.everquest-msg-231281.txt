Do you guys think it's possible for a 57 Bard to solo Old Sebilis from
the entrance to the exit?  I recently completed the quest for the keys
to Sebilis and I've been really interested in checking the place out. 
The only problem is that I have found it being difficult to get a
group together to go there.  I never get a response from anyone when I
/ooc if anyone wants to hunt in Sebilis.
