Ingot's been playing his druid a LOOONG time, so the tactics
may have changed (or evolved) since he was at those levels.

I think the point here is that quadding can be dangerous to
third parties, and that it's difficult to keep track of where
everybody else is well enough to avoid it. Most people can
cope with being attacked by one MOB, but with the
exception of quad-kiters, most can't cope with four
simultaneous adds. So, as he said, be considerate. The
simplest way to avoid training other players to to keep away
from them.

I'm pretty much with you on this one, actually... i.e. it's fair
enough to grab 4 MOBs if you can cope as long as others
don't suffer for it. MOBs aren't usually so rare that a quadder
stops others from hunting.

Snip "Druids and... so". The point here is that quadding is
essentially a controlled train. Training others is a bad idea
whatever your class, but it's much easier to do it accidentally
while quadding - so be careful.

"It's OK if other people do it too". Baloney. If other people
do it, that doesn't mean that repeating their mistake is all right.
It only means that there are a lot of jerks out there. Don't be
one of them.

This is all useful advice; basically it's all about how to minimise
disruption to other players while you follow a strategy which
is personally rewarding but risky to those around you. If
you honestly don't care about such things... you reap what you
sow. Don't expect to make any friends that way.

What it all comes down to is what Ingot started off saying:
Please be considerate. It's a multiplayer game; as a game, it
should be fun, but as it's multiplayer, you should have some
consideration for not ruining the fun of others.

[Snip the remainder of Ingot's - and your - advice; I don't play
a druid or wizzie, so only have a very broad idea of the tactics
involved.]
