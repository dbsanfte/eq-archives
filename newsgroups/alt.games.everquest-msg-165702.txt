Your guild monks must suck if coh splitting was ever a prefered choice in
any zone, sorry.

Yes the nerf sucked, I don't think it was right, but please clarify "not all
that hot".. because pre-nerf we werent anywhere near gimped.

Imo pre-nerf monks, rogues and rangers were where they should be, AC caps
was the downfall of warriors, SK's and Palis (Palis still need something I
think.. maybe more group spells, like the new ATK buffs, agro buffs etc that
sk's got)
