I was thinking the same exact thing.  BUT my twist is that there was
suppose to be more to the hornets than just a mob that you could use
the summon spell.  They give faction, WHY?  No faction on gorillas or
skeletons.  Was the hornet area suppose to be a place to sit and med
in safety unless you killed them.

 Why didn't they change the gorillas to animals? They are undead.
They should call them ghost gorillas, zombie gorrillas, etc.
