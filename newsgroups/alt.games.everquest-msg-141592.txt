As already said, under 20 the cap is about 29 and under 10th it is about 20.
My human SK in his high teens could exceed the damage cap using a Bloodfork
(which I think was 15/29) but his strength was over 150. My Dark Elf Warrior
at that level never did.

The weapon you seem to have is the Silver Swift Blade (or Silver Aggro Blade
as you will likely end up referring to it) 16/24 2hs and it'll often give
you the mobs undivided attention at the lower levels. Use it with care when
grouped, make sure your tank is wielding something that'll keep aggro from
you, everytime I have seen one of these used  (never seen one on anyone over
35th) the Ranger took a pounding for it...but that was when this was an
"uber" twink item and not 300pp or so in the Bazaar.
If it's something different and is 17/24 then it'll be even more dangerous
:ï¿½)
