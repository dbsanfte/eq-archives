PoV/PoS - Get through the PoJ trials. Trial of Execution is the staple one
and the most straightforward. All you need is some decent dps a good tank
and something to keep everyone alive (slower, extra healer, CCer whatever.
Did it with a pally once who used group-heal to take aggro from all mobs
every wave. no CC or slow used just let them eat DamageShield). Oh and a
healer who can keep a tank alive through the executioner. Nothing big, lots
of pickup groups on most servers and if you're 1 class short you can often
ask LFGers. ps Mages rule in the exec trials :).

CoD - Get in a pickup raid for Grummus (hard) or do the quest. Quest also
gives a nice insta-click item. Not too hard once you know the spawnspots of
the questmobs.

PoI Factory - Get a pickup group for the Xenamech quest. Occasionally held
on my server but make sure you have lots of friends to warn you :).

PoNb - (Lair of Therrus Thule) - No point going there but you can try to get
17 friends together and do the mazequest in PoN. It's fun to do but you'll
need at least 2 or 3 people capable of mezzing those mobs (61+ mez spells).


Ask around for tier 3 flags when you think you can try them :).
