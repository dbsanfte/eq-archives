 A good group can get further in and not worry about trains, either.
Verix room, Hand room, Warlord room are all good camps with low risk and
decent xp. However with todays equipped players it can get crowded in
there easily and you run out of stuff to pull. So if it's crowded you'd
do better to go elsewhere.
