Weird this hasn't been answered yet, or maybe I'm just missing it.  Cost is
12.95USD if you pay on a monthly basis.  Cheaper if you go longer.  Go to
www.everquest.com and I'm sure most of your most basic questions can be
answered there or at www.everquestlive.com if you hate bloated websites as
much as I do.
