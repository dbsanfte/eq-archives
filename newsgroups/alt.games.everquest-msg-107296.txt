Couple nights ago in seb, we have an okay exp group going at b2. I'm
doing some charming to help speed up the kills (I just can't resist
those caster frogs). Bard joins the group. Two pulls come in, I charm
a frog.

/g Charmed whatever_frog_01

/pet attack

Frog just sits there. I realize the bard has mezzed my pet, so I ask
nicely to let me take care of the mezzing. Mez finally breaks, pet
starts attacking, then mezzed again. This happens another time.

So, next pull, two come. I decide that this charming business isn't
going to work with the bard here, so I go back to plain old mezzing. I
/assist the MA, then mez the other frog right as he arrives at group.
Bard hits my mezzed frog, then mezzes the other. I ask again to let me
take care of the mezzing. Response from the bard? "I mez things that
hit me."

At this point, I feel I need some sleep, so go off to bed ;)
