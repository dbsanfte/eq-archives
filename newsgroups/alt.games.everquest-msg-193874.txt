Thanks for the advice, all.

I just dinged level 9 this afternoon with my Druidess, and got some
new spells.  Wish I could have afforded them all, but that will come
with time.  Crushbone has been interesting, but I keep getting killed
:)

Made a new character, a female Halfling Paladin also.  Didn't see the
pun in the randomly generated name until I'd saved, Teenea (teeny). 
Can't wait to try her out as well.

I keep trying new things -- hope I can stay with a character long
enough to get really powerful.

I'd love to try a Dark Elf, but I get so lost in Neriak that it hasn't
been worth it so far.  Is there a GOOD map of the city somewhere?  I
bought the EQAtlas on eBay for a song, but a thread recently talked
about how bad it is, so no help there.  Probably will check
eqatlas.com, and have to download and print all the maps sometime.

Again, I thank you all for your kind replies and help.
