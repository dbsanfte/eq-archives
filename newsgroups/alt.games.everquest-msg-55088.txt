Bit low to be hoping for you mobs to be dropping + int items. Normally id
say EK for level 16 mage, but while the GM events are going on, id give EK a
miss. You would find blue mobs in NK or SK to solo. Lake of ill omen would
work in a group at windmill, buit this is a lot more dangeous than
karanas.... especially to get to.
