Yep. Skyfire, as others have mentioned. My wife is one of those smiths
teetering on grandmasterhood and has started making the cultural dorf
enchanted whatever. I was sent to hunt for lavarocks for her previously.
I spent DAYS killing fire elementals in lavastorm and najena. I think I
got two. And I'd killed literally hundreds of the bastards. Your best
bet, in my experience, is to pull the Lava Walkers and the regular
beasts of that ilk in Skyfire. Not only have we seen a somewhat better
drop rate ourselves, but the two people that Tiru found to sell her
*stacks* of them were long time spell hunters in SF. You might try just
going there and auctioning, but be prepared to pay upwards of 50 plat
*each* for them. (Yes, that's 1 KPP a stack)
*sigh*
