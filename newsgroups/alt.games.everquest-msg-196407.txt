I've had my level 21 barbarian beastlord in PC for a while now. He doesn't
seem to be leveling all that fast. I guess part of it could be getting
killed by nasty trains at least once per session. Paludal Caverns is okay if
you find a good group. I think there are too many idiots there. There is a
lot of camp hogging, kill-stealing, and people not controlling their mobs
and then dropping them on other groups. I can't wait to find another hunting
area! That's part of the reason I picked my lower leveled warrior back up.
