How odd, my son (5 year old playing EQ, its a little odd I know) made
a barb beastlord a couple days ago and played him up to 4th level, did
that quest, and definately got a polar bear appearance helm for his
trouble... things like this excite him beyond all reason.

We have SOL but have all character models except horses/pets
turned off to cut lag (and the basic ugliness of the new models)
