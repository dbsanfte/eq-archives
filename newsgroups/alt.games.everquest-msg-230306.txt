Manasong.

If your group is a bit more enlightened than that, you can get away with
things like resist song and amplificating.  Other things, such as hasting
and slowing are already accounted for (though you may be in the same group
as some melees, so you might get away with singing haste, but in generaly,
your job is as a mana battery).

Of course, my Bard is only 26, so take all that with a grain of salt.
That's just what I've seen with my paladin.
