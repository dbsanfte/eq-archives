The secret to Gornaire is lots of damage, fast.  Wizards are your friends, more 
so than rogues or monks or warriors.  Gore procs an AE slow in addition to her 
fear, so your melee damage output is generally very low.  The trick is to get 
her in one spot, hold her there, and let the nukers kill her.  Gore has 32khp, 
so an all-out maximum damage output fight is the best bet.
