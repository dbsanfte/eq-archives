heh i posted a bit ago about the final coldain ring war sometimes being
bugged....

Anyway a friend sent me a SS the other day from the view of his poor "iksar"
rogue

I made a train to be proud of today too, after the guild did Vindi this
morning, there weren't any porters left in the arena and i was late for
work... got some cleric buffs, then trained every single giant from inside
the arena (up the ramp) to the EW zoneline (/hug run speed 3) luckily i only
got stunned once, and actually made it with half my hp left (after mending)

needless to say i still got bitched at, despite the fact i shouted for 5
mins before even moving from arena that a train was headed to EW.. ah well
:)
