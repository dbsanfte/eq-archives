I'm surprised iksar can even wear banded... but they can.

Still by the 20s you can *start* working on dreadscale and the other 
iksar class armours. And there's the lowbie DoN stuff too. But with 
iksar regen, and their AC bonus they probably don't need better than 
cloth and curscale for the first few levels anyhow. :)

I got my iksar monk alt fungal stuff from PC because it is doable in the 
low teens, as same as Rawhide (and comparable to Wu's), and like Wu's 
very low weight.

I'd rather see players getting Blackened Alloy Mail than Banded Mail... 
while pulling out the MPII medalions...but the banded stuff will be much 
easier to obtain. :-/

Overall seems reasonable to me.

No. Not any more.

But I'd let players buy consumables (arrows, food, drink,  even potions) 
from higher level guildies. They just replace npc bought items and do 
not deprive players of 'looting or making their own' because they get 
used up anyways before long.
