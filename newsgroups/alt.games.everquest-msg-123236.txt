There are lots of EQ-related websites.. some of the better ones are

http://eq.castersrealm.com/
www.everlore.com
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/

And the official site- www.everquest.com

The original game of the version.  I would definately reccomend starting
with Original Everquest, and Ruins of Kunark as a definite minimum.   Those
2 plus Scars of Velious if you progress past level 30 or so.

I wouldn't really say get Luclin unless you really like the game, and
progress in it (I.e dont get bored and quit after a week)

Note everything except the original, are all expanison packs (and require
the original to run)

> Can I play more than one character with one account?

8 characters - only 1 at a time though
