 Tab, Enter. You still had to agree you just didn't need to do it with a
mouse.

 Adapt my ass... From Alan:

"Regarding reports of Feign Death causing 100% memory wipe
We are hearing reports that Feign Death is causing NPCs to always and
completely forget about the person using FD. If this is indeed happening
(and we're checking into it now), it was an unintentional change. "

 Having said that, FD actually seemed to fail less than normal
yesterday. But that's never a bad thing.

 Aggro in general is screwed up. It has nothing to do with the damage
Rangers may or may not be doing. 

 I do agree Rangers were abe to do too much damage practically risk free
and that should change but if the last patch is any indication, I'd say
SOE didn't get it quite right.
