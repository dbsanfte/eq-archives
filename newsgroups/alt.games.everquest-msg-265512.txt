Nope.  Well, not really.  I would guess it uses more system power as opposed
to GPU power (great GPU's werent out at the time).  Add in all the updates
(code slung on top of code), its major bloatware, no modern game I have runs
as badly as EQ does on my system, its not even doing anything that amazing,
bland textures, no real fancy effects.  Its just a memory hog, and I would
guess it has very bad r-speeds in places like PoK.

For reference my system is:

XP2100 (@133 x 16 = 2168).
512mb 333mhz crucal ddr ram
geforce 5900 128mb

New games run sweet, EQ runs like a pile of turd until the textures are
loaded.  Strange you are having problems though, only weakness in your
system (or what I would guess would be the bottleneck), would be your CPU,
even that should be more than enough for EQ.

Oh, and if there is no effect when you change rez, you can pretty much
guarentee it is not your GPU that is the bottleneck / issue (or you would
notice slowdown on rez upping).

Try mucking about with the EQ options a bit (though you probably already
have), sometimes one small change can have a great effect on some people
machines, no idea what you should actually change though :)
