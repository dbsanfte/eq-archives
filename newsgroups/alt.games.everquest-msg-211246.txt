I disagree.  I believe that laws lagging is a good thing, given
that lawmakers are just as foolish, self-interested, and error-
prone as the rest of us.  For an entertaining take on the idea
that governmental inertia is far better than the alternative,
you might enjoy Frank Herbert's novels featuring Jorge McKie,
Saboteur Extraordinaire.  "Whipping Star" is the only title I
recall offhand, but there are several more.  Regardless the
merits of Herbert's fiction, I'd hate to see the disasters our
boys and girls in Washington could create were they able to
enact and enforce laws as quickly as all the pressure groups
waving cash in their faces want them to.  The delays built into
our system serve us well on the whole, imo.
