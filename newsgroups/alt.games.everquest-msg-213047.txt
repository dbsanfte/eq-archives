Is anybody else expeiencing EQ crashing when you try to bring up the
/bazaar window since the recent patch? Or is that just me...?

And I was so excited that they upped the trader limit and fixed the
/trader window. But if /bazaar doesn't work, what's the point?

*hoping for patch to fix this soon*
