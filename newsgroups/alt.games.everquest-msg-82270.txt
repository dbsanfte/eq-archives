If you don't know that language, I wouldn't bother -- I don't think you'll
just pick it up :)

That is a bit of a narrow minded view; everything in the NG must be English,
or for that matter that this is an English only newsgroup.  I seem to have
missed that (alt.englishonlygames.everquest ?).  Frankly I'm surprised there
are not more languages posted here...
