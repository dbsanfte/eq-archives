NM, Shadowed Men clock in at 3.00 run mod.  Thistle Underbrush in Lfay
clocks in at 2.00, as do the Blood Wolves in Mistmoore (the black dire is
only 1.25 though).  Oh, and the Maiden's Voyage in Timorous clocks in at an
amazing 12.50, most boats are only 3.00

I thought about it again, and calculated his speed a bit more, I'd actually
estimate him at 2.25 or 2.50.

Snare cuts the mod almost in half, and normal player run mod is 1.25, so a
snared Grimfeather is still going to have around 1.33 run mod, which still
lets him catch up to an unsowed player.

I'll have to check a few things at some point in-game, load up my fastest
long duration run spell (wolf form, puts my run mod at just over 2.0) and
see how fast Grimfeather can chase, then fire off SoC (puts run mod at
nearly 2.7) and compare; then go repeat the test on a confirmed 2.50 mod
(Oracle Qulin in FoB or any of the realm of heroes NPCs, just need to find
one close to an escape point), and possibly on a 2.0 mod (Hiya Thistle!
Though I'll have to deal with his SoW also)

Oh, and as for the source of all this information, I found a static database
that someone compiled off ShowEQ (recently).  Shows name, class, race,
gender, runspeed, level, some spawn /locs (useless though really) and a few
other pieces of information that are pretty much useless, although one of
them seems to be a numeric designation where animals have one number
(Tangrin in FoB is a level 54 animal! =p), undead have another, and so on
(spiders share the designation with insects, wtf?).  There's some
information on faction hits and loot tables, but it's incomplete and in some
places horribly wrong.
