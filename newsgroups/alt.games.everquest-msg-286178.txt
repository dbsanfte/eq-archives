I played awhile.  Seems like once you hit 50 its mostly faction grind, which 
I could have put up with except at about that point it started becoming 
harder to find a group because so many had quit.  So I went to lotro.  I 
went back to try vg again when I had 1 day left on my subscription and found 
that the hitching and ctds were no longer tolerable after playing a game 
that was smooth.
