Although I agree in general with your complaint, this particular aspect 
of it doesn't quite wash.  Forage isn't a racial skill, rather, its a 
class skill, like hide.  It just so happens that certain races get 
universal access to forage, just as certain races get access to Hide 
even for members who don't happen to be rogues.

On Earth we don't have classes in the Norrath way, if anything we have 
AD&D style class structure which lets us multiclass, but even better 
would be something along the lines of GURPS where you simply learn 
whatever you want to apply energy to, willy nilly... but if you want a 
job, it will help if you spend a significant part of that energy 
learning job related things.

The rigid class structure of EQ means that you simply can't learn 
certain skills unless you are a member of a class which teaches them... 
unless you're a member of a race where everyone learns that skill.  Even 
then, you'll never be GOOD at that skill unless your class gives you 
better access to it; the skill cap for most racial skills is a whopping 50!
