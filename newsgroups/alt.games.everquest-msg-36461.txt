As far as I know the file is just like all the other music and can not be
turned off or deleted by itself.  Search for a web stie called "Hacker's
Quest".  They have a utility that lets you look at the compressed files EQ
uses.  You see that there are sound files in there (though unfortunately
I've not found software to extract and play them or re-encode to MP3 or MIDI
files).  There are also BMP files which are used for the landscapes and
other graphics.  Some of them can be useful to extract and save (Lavastorm
rock, ship dock wood, Desert of Ro sand Windows wallpaper).
