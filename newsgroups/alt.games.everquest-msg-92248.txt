OK, can you please just go drown yourself in the bathtub now?  You're 
obviously too stupid to be using up valuble oxygen.  
I'm going to give you a little hint.  If you ALWAYS TRAIN TO THE SAME 
SIDE, BOTH ZONES ARE SAFE.  You're in DL, being a knob, and some dumb 
druid made a mistake and sow'd you, so you can actually survive the run to 
zone.  You see KC in view, you get to it, you go RIGHT, not left, but 
RIGHT.  Now, you cross over the zone line, and pop up on in KC, where all 
the nice people are medding and rezzing and waiting for groups.  Someone 
in KC gets in over their head, they run for zone, they go RIGHT, and the 
train doesn't hurt the nice people medding.  Remember, the mobs can't 
follow you across the zone line, so it's not like you have to worry about 
that.

See, I've even included a diagram so you can visualize it.  In either way 
when you come to a decision, turn right.  Your train will follow.  You 
will zone out to the safety of the other side.
