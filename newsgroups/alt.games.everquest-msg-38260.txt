>>>SNIP<<<

There is one phrase that I live by, and it looks like VI is living by it
also:

"If you try to please everybody, you'll end up pleasing nobody."

No matter what VI does, they are going to piss some portion of the players
off. That is a fact proven in this newsgroup over and over again. Best I can
tell you is, if you don't like it, don't play. If you still want to play,
then learn to deal with it.

TCC is a done deal, the entirety of SoL will be TCC, and that's that. And
BTW, ever since the announcement that there would be a SoL, they haved said
it would have the TCC code. I don't know why people are acting like they
just announced this yesterday.
