Knowing how to throw a jab, uppercut, hook, side kick whatever is great on a
punchbag.
Knowing when to do it can be learnt in sparring but you really only get
proper experience when you opponent is not trying to just push your ability,
he/she is trying to lay you out as quicks possible.
Same must go for any combat, whether it's with a fist, a staff or a Halberd,
how to swing the weapon effictively can be taught, when to swing it can only
be learnt in combat.

Casters learn by practice, they are learning the correct hand gestures or
pronounciations. I believe it's channeling that enables you to cast thru
melee distractions...that, maybe, should only go up when in a combat
situation.
