I never played an SK to any reasonable level, so I can't do any
comparison, however I have played beastlords a LOT.

a beast hea the usual problem of meleeing everything until at least
level 9, then you get you first pet, following pets come at 15, 22,
30, 39, 49, and then fairly regularly after. Every time you get a new
pet you are a GOD! beasts are heavily dependant on their warder for
decent DPS.

Imho all the way to 49 is fairly quick and not particularly hard to
do, after that (as with most classes, I suspect, barring maybe
quadding and charming classes) it begins to slow down.

no more yellows after 30 or so though :)

Probably the most efficient line of spells beast have is the pet
heals, though we have a fairly well rounded spell set I think, we
melee reasonable well for a leather class, but are not designed to be
tanks.

A beasts best chance for a group is to advertize your DPS and the
Beast crack line of spells, and later as the third slowing class (with
epic)

As Beastlords become better understood they are becoming more wanted
in groups, I love my beasts, if you are thinking of soloing, and don't
care about faction, then Iksar have great AC, high wis and regen,
though there are arguments for playing all beast races (Tribunal Barb
has excellent cultural armor), just go with whatever turns you on :)

Mrowh 55/54 Beastlord on Karana.

Frostfist (41) Beastlord on Stromm.

Otserp (32) Mage on Venril Sathir.

Wikkan (42) Druid on Karana, Nekk (32) Necromancer, Moorbane (26) Warrior, Zinga (32) Bard, etc....
