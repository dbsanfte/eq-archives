As a 55 enchanter I'll give you a hint: Start now

Only way your gonna complete it is if you start it and continue to work on
it as you progress. Don't expect to do it in a weeks time. There are enough
hard to get mobs that you might not have it done by level 60.

Shissar - Weekish spawn in Fear and hardest to get to
Verina Toomb - One of the shortest lived mobs in the game... Normally camped
around the clock
Vessel Drozlin - kinda same as Verina Toomb
Prince in Chardok - Hard to get to... got mine while running on a King Raid
for someone elses epic...
Cazel - Not to hard... play a low level alt with low level friends in
Oasis... log a group there for quick gathering when Cazel spawns...
Tangrin in FoB - Normally up but takes a decent force to take down
Ghost in The Hole - Can be easy to get to... or hard to get to... depends on
if you got a cleric/CoH mage handy...

Most of the rest of epic is fairly easy ground spawn or charm/hand in... I'm
personally waiting to do most of that until I get all but one or so of these
5 mobs... thos 5 mobs are all bottlenecks in the epic... and only way to get
em is by camping the spots that they spawn because there are ALOT of
chanters wanting there epics... atleast on my server

And if your not agnostic ya need to work on faction... lotta ways to get
Bloodsaber up but hope you don't like walking back into Queynos heh :)

but the epic is alot of work. I'm about half way done maybe. and I started
around level 51.

Good Luck
