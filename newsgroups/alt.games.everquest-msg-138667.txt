I have 3 perfect owlbear pelts that I'm not gonna let go of easily. 
Someone kept shouting they were buying so I took pity and told him I'd 
sell him one for 600pp.  He thought I was joking.  If I'm gonna give up 
a pelt he's gonna pay me enough to make it worthwhile.  Those pelts can 
be made into Rallic packs, 85% WR, 10 slot bags, worth 1K if they are 
sold.  I figure I'm taking a 400pp hit for letting him have one of my 
pelts.  Aint no way I'm letting it go for less.
