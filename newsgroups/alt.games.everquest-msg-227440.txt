Aye. I've done it myself, and you're right. That's just one more option 
available. It doesn't tend to work too well in some cases though. Take 
the giant fort in Frontier Mountains. Everyone knows you might get a 
forest loop (fairly rare) or one of a couple other lesser but still 
decent for some people items, yet if you offered to give up your chances 
at everything else for the loop if it drops, you get laughed out of the 
zone whether it was your group or not. Heck, if your were camping it 
yourself to begin with, you probably don't need it in the first place.
