Hitting Ctrl-W in Internet Explorer closes the current browser window.
It's *very* handy for machine-gunning runaway popups and/or popups
that go "full screen" like you describe -- you can rapid-fire Ctrl-W
faster than the popups can load and initialize their "if I get closed,
launch another popup" code.

I'm not sure if the Ctrl-W key combo works the same way in Netscape,
but try it and see.  If it does, it's a big help.
