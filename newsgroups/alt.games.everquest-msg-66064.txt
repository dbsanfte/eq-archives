You won't lose your characters, since they're stored on VI's servers, not 
locally. However, your configuration files are stored locally so you could 
lose things like hotkey settings, socials, friends lists, how you've set up 
the GUI, etc. Do yourself a favour and back up all your *.opt and *.ini 
files to a floppy and chuck them back in your Everquest directory when you 
reinstall. That will save you having to reconfigure everything in-game.

But why not just hook up your old HD as a slave and copy your entire 
Everquest directory onto your newly formatted HD? That would save you DLing 
all the patches again, since EQ doesn't pepper your machine with DLLs and 
registry entries, everything is self-contained in its own folder. Just copy 
the folder and make a new shortcut to everquest.exe

Backing up the *.opt and *.ini files is better than nothing, you'll just 
have to go through a huge long reinstall/patch to get the game up and 
running again.
