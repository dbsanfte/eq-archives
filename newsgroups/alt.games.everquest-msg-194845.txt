Safehouse Response from Gyorg

As a player of Everquest, a maintainer of an Everquest related message
board, and an intelligent individual, I would like to say I feel this
article is more editorial than factual and intends to only show one side of
the story for the purpose of 'shocking' the reader. The majority of
Everquest players are educated adults (1). Those who commit some injustice
usually have other psychological problems.

This story mentions many negative situations which are blamed on Everquest.
Mr Woolley in particular is an example of a game being blamed for something
which can very easily be attributed to his psychological state. The amount
of coverage of his death can be attributed to the his mother's use of the
press to pressure Sony to reveal the account information of his Everquest
character so that she could investigate his online habits. "An estimated
22.1 percent of Americans ages 18 and older?about 1 in 5 adults?suffer from
a diagnosable mental disorder in a given year." (2,3) Everquest has a
population over 400,000. This implies 88,400 Everquest players have a
diagnosable mental disorder, (assuming no other biasing factors). This can
more than account for the number of players who commit injustices attributed
to the game.

While Everquest may be addictive, it is addictive in the way anything can be
addictive. There is a distinction between chemical and mental addiction and
Everquest falls into the second category along with gambling, sex, and
eating. While all of these are important not to disregard, we do not blame
food manufacturers for creating good tasting food. We do not blame those who
are having sex with a nymphomaniac. And we do not blame casino's for
gambling addiction. We do however expect them to help deal with those who
are addicted, (mainly because of the monetary penalty of addiction to
gambling). Sony has also attempted to help those addicted to Everquest. They
implemented a timer in the game to help those addicted to the game keep
track of how much time they are spending on it. But in the end, except for a
nominal monthly fee, the only thing Everquest players lose or risk is time.
Something that many many other addictions, (cars, tv, etc), use also.
Everquest harbors none of the physical hazards associated with things such
as over-eating or sex.

As said above, most of todays players are in their 40's and well-paid
professionals (1). There are professional athletes (4), and screenwriters
(5). The team maintaining my message board is composed of an Intel employee,
a programmer versed in fingerprint recognition algorithms, a graphics
designer, a student who will graduate as an electrical engineer in May, and
a computer science student. Our board members include software quality
engineers, layers, and military service men and women. While we are
entertained by Everquest, we recognize the importance of our duties in life:
our jobs, our family and our schooling. While many spend an amount of time
that would make those who do not play gasp, (41 hours per week for a quarter
of those surveyed), Dr Mark Davies, a respected psychologist, does not
believe this unhealthy. "There will always be some people who do not manage
to control their investment in a certain activity... but it is not a big
problem." "Most people I know spend about 3-4 hours a night watching TV...
so in many cases it is just a substitution of entertainment rather than some
unfortunate development in their lifestyle (1)." Unfortunately I do not know
the specifics of Mr Bragg's situation to comment on it.

The Everquest Widows group, while more than a non-existent group, is highly
publicised because of the surprise most people who do not take part in
virtual worlds, whether games, chat rooms, or other, have over the idea that
a virtual world could effect the real world. The economics of virtual worlds
are beginning to be documented and may impact the macroeconomics of the
world (6). There is specific research related to the economy of Everquest
suggesting Everquest has a nominal hourly wage of about $3.42/hour and a GDP
ranked 77th, right below Russia (7). The exchange rate from Norrath's
currency to USD is 0.0107 which is greater than the Yen or Lira (7). Virtual
worlds are not separate from the physical world and so love is lost and won
in them. While Everquest Widows exemplifies the loss, there are many who do
find love online. I know of a couple who met in Everquest, had a long
distance relationship, and has now moved together. Many people know people
who have found a significant other through virtual worlds. And I honestly
can say I don't know a couple who has been divorced because of Everquest or
any other online universe.

In conclusion, Everquest, and for that matter all virtual worlds, be it
another game, (Worlds of Warcraft, Star Wars Galaxies, Asheron's Call,
Shadowbane, Dark Ages of Camelot, The Sims Online, etc), a chat room, (IRC,
Java, or other), a message board, or any of the possible online communities,
they are just that, communities. Games introduce the idea of risk, reward,
and measurable achievement. As online communities grow, they reorganize
humanity, not according to geographical location, but according to personal
interests and beliefs. Because of this they are popular and have a direct
effect on the physical world, links between physical people, and physical
responsibilities. It would be wrong to ignore this link, but to place blame
on the world is analogous to placing the blame for all other divorces on the
society we live in and to expect society to fix it's self rather than those
who are contemplating divorce fixing their relationships. Online worlds are
a medium in which any of the social problems of today are capable of
manifesting. We must deal with the problems, not with the world.
