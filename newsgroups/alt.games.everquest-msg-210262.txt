Like i said in another topic, I struggled for 2 years with low numbers,
heavy reliance on bots (2 people 2boxing clerics, as the entire cheal
rotation), so overwhelming force isn't my major raiding experience

Normal numbers? Well of course its down to the mob your facing. Our
raids/numbers usually went something like (a patch day, plus PoP repops)
tormax, 6 ppl
cursed, 18 ppl
seru 18 ppl
emp 24 ppl
solro 30 ppl
pyro 30ppl
charm birds 30 ppl
drauv 32 ppl
solro 32 ppl
35-40 ppl; babs, hydro, magma, poe rings, PoA

Dependent on person, that was either artificially high numbers via bots, or
at best 1/6 bots

That was prexus, to clarify
