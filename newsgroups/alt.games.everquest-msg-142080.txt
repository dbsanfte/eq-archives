And what is to be defended against?  C'mon now, think!  Don't stop at
the first most obvious association that comes into your head.  Pursue
the issue until your head swims with the possibilities, then take a
step or two back and consider how little the surface of most political
issues connect with the underlying realities.

Here're a few clues for you:
Soundbites are NOT deep.
Cliches are NOT wisdom.
Most populists are in it for themselves, you are less than dirt to them.


Good luck!
