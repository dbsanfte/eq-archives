Well, it's certainly more about "it being a test server" than it is
about "available to any paying subscriber".  All the servers are
available to all of us. Fact is, if every single person who chooses to
use Test as a main play server got together and decided to go make a
level one character on Zeb, they could.  The difference, of course, is
that instead of a bunch of assholes yelling "TestTubies get off
Innoruuk!" you'd more likely have a bunch of high levels trying to give
all the "newbies" the junk out of their banks to get them started.
