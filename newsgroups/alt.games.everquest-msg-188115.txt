Canni 5 first, without a doubt.

After that I'd go virulent paralysis, its just soooo useful.  Knockback/root
is a massive boost to trying to slow mobs whilst they are smacking you,
without having to worry about root being memm'd, and the space to move
around

After that I'd max SCM, then crit heals or SCMR - I've got level 1 of each
and its close to decide what I'll raise first... I think reinforcement just
edges it, with its the obvious buff duration benefit, but also the extra
duration of quiesensce (fucker cost me 125kpp, Im gonna get my moneys
worth!)

4 doggies is cute, but to be honest, it's a pretty useless skill.  Something
for fun, when working on important AA's gets boring !
