Actually, I had heard that LoIO was the place for *good* races to hunt in
Kunark.  Merchant at the Windmill, can bind and bank at FV (if you don't
mind the scary run through the drachnids), and a variety of monsters for
late teens / early twenties.

I've hunted in the OT and managed to lose all the XP I gained to the *&%^
Dragoons.  When I turn 50 there's gonna be some payback.  :)

I'm a Drinalite, too.  What's your char name?
