 i am playing a human necromancer, at lvl 20 my pet is quite good and i use
it whenever i can.
Just the other day, i joined a new group and the team leader asked me to
drop my pet, so that my pet wouldn't take a share of the XP.  As a team, of
course i dropped my pet, but i oom more often than i like, but we all
managed to stay alive.  The question is does my pet really take away our XP?
Thanks!
