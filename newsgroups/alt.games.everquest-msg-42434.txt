     Yes , once a monk gets round kick , all special attacks hit magical.
But I'm not sure at what level it kicks in or what causes it but I know from
personal experience , that at some point , monks don't need magic gloves to
hit magic even with plain punches. One day on a corpse run, butt naked, I
attacked a wisp, needing a light source, and was surprised to see my punches
landing. I had expected to kill it with just flying kicks but had turned the
regular attack on out of habit.

By the way I have seen several questions recently with young monks wanting
magic gloves but not able to afford wu's recently. Seems a lot of monks
don't know that netted gloves hit magic creatures. I got my first pair off
of a froglock in Qeynos when I was level 5. Easy to get , free and light
weight; everything a young monk needs.
