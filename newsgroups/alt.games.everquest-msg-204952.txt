Any members here took on Mith marr in past week or so?

we have killed him twice and the projection has twice failed to give us
flags. Twice it was petitioned with /report of "hail mith marrs corpse" and
"hail projection" to give the stupid GMs an idea that we just killed it but
they asked us to kindly quit whining and fuck off and submit a /bug so they
can fix it.

Would like to know if any other servers are having this trouble or it's just
Xegony or we are doing something monumentally wrong.

We, one in, clear to mith marr room. Pull and kill his named guards and then
Froggy. Split his guardians and kill them. Kill the respawns except two near
area we going to kill him and CC them, pull mith marr and issue the slap
down. Mith marr dead, projection spawns, no flags. Done something wrong ?
