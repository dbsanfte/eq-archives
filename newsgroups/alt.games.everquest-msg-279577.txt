True,I never ever bought a Kei with my Cleric,in the mid fifties I did
countless Ldons with him without any mind buffs,lots of those Ldons
were just me and a hand full of melees.
Nowadays I do DoN missions without ever getting Kei before,usually
there is a Bst,Mage or Necro to give some additional mana,but its not
really needed,I am fm 99% of the time,though I need to med or sit on
horse,meleeing with yaulp mana regeneration is no longer possible
with mobs hitting for 700ish.
Seeing casters letting wait the group to get Kei makes me cry,maybe
they should have payed more attention in the mathematics classes,
letting the entire group wait 10m or 15m to get a buff which gives 140
mana /minute does not make any sense.
I already left some groups out of this reason,when playing my Ranger
and see the *Cleric* do this,clearly a sign he *sucks* badly or is
ebayed.

Exactly,I dont mind getting a MGB Kei,lets me throw in some nukes in
DoN missions,not that it makes a noticable difference.   =)
