I'm starting to think that Shissar is a slightly more polite Ragefire
situation.  Someone (with a guild to back it up) offered me 200k to get the
Shissar that was up during my Fear raid.  Thankfully she was from a POLITE
uberguild and when she finally got the clue that I didn't give a shit HOW
much she gave me (I would have lost a hell of a lot of friends for that
200k), she finally went away.

You can be DAMNED sure I did a /who on the zone constantly to make sure that
we weren't being leapfrogged. <g>  I lied to a LOT of outsiders that day,
saying that she was already dead.

I lucked out, it was a raid that was scheduled a couple weeks in advance.
