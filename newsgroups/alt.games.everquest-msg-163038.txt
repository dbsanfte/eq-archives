SOW potions till 51, if not pretty well twinked out or PLed, will run far far
more than 5kpp, and they are interruptable and not much faster than the boots.,
not to mention the bother of constantly restocking the things.

I'd happily pay 5kpp for a clicky invis item, even though I can have clicky
invis in potion form anytime I want off a vendor.  Restocking is a pain, more so
when its off players.

I'd happily pay 5kpp for a clicky Locate Corpse item, even though I can have
clicky LC any time I want off a vendor.

Charges suck.

None really, but he'll still own them later when a instaclick IS valuable as a
debuff prevention device

Plus unless he's a bard, he can't click TBoots on the run and CAN be interrupted
clicking them.

I have to admit I own two pairs of TBoots, one on my cleric (rotting in bank)
and one on my bard (still in use, he's only 41, got 10 more good levels on them
at least)

But I wish the TBoots on my cleric were JBoots, Spyglass is a nuisance as a
instaclick.  If the cost is about the same, deal with the little chore of
running to RM, I say.
