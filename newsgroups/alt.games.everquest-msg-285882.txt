There's a collect/turn-in quest that ends up getting you a clicky
undead only slow item with a long re-cast time.

There's three levels of similar items to Ebons/Radiants.  Easy level
(gets you TSS Rk.I type spells, armour and weapons), normal level
(gets you TSS Rk.II spells, armour and weapons) and a third raid level
currency (Rk.III etc).  From what I've seen you can get solo tasks
that help with faction for the above vendors but you need groups tasks
to actually get the currency themselves.  Or you can buy them.

The level of non-raid gear available to competent players far
outstrips even TSS.  The chain boots I saw linked had 265 HPs without
any augments.

They've done this for a while.  Usually archived at EQInterface for UI
modders.
