I have read this post and the replies thus far and I have an answer for you
that may sound very simplistic, but it is pretty accurate...

I am going on the assumption here that you have seen and/or read some
fantasy stories...  There are always different classes in these stories,
Warriors are generally always among these classes.  With the exception of
Magical Armor and Weapons, Warriors are historically Hack and Slash Tanks.
I also have over 20 years of AD&D under my belt as a player, DM, and Play
Tester for TSR.  Warriors in that particular game also get no real magic
benefits.  The basis of the movies, the stories and the games is really
about what friendship or partnership can do for a person.  There is rarely
ever a Warrior to be found in a story that doesn't have his buddy the Cleric
or his buddy the Spell Caster nearby.

Warriors get benefits that no other class gets in terms of melee combat and
so forth.  Each Class has something neat that sets them apart.  As a Ranger,
I am good at a lot of things, and master of none (save fletching... hehe).
Yes, at level 30 I can FINALLY SoW, and I do so to everyone I see mana
permitting.  My partner is a Warrior.  I won't leave Qeynos without him...
hehe  I call him my Antonica Express.  I would love Gate and Bind but I
don't get em and that's that.  If I wanted them bad enough to complain about
it, I would simply play a class that gets them...  Thus my alt the Shammy...

Just my 2 cents...
