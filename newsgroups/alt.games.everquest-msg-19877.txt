I would imagine it's to keep people from buying gear on an older
server with lower prices, moving to another server with higher prices
for the same items and reselling it (in effect, becoming a
trans-server merchant). 

Anyone who hit upon this plan would, naturally, have to transfer
between servers a large number of times. While this might or might not
hurt the economy, the added system burden of transferring character
files repeatedly would almost certainly harm system performance.
