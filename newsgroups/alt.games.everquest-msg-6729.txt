Good place, lots of good loot for money.
Never crowded, Just tell the high levels farming/camping
items to leave some spawns for you.

> Giant Fort in FM

Good but usually crowded.

> Uthorks in EW

Lousy loot, but easy kills.

> Mistmoore

Ugh I hate that place. Good items drops but train city.
The zone is fine but one idiot, or a group of idiots can
ruin it. Best time I had there was when my group was the
only ones there.

Lake of Ill Omen is good. People say its crowded but
there are tons of things to kill. I have been in the zone with over
110 people and always had plenty to kill and no one got
in each others way.

But over all I like SolA, good exp, good loot, and not
crowded.
