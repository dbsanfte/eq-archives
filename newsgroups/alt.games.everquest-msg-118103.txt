We did the same camp with a 59 cleric, 60 enchanter, 60 SK, 60 druid,
60 rogue, and 57 monk and found it a little hard to keep up with, even
with a fair number of AA points and a large percentage of HoT+ gear.
The chanter got eaten twice and the cleric was constantly LoM, even
after she got the FT3 boots. OTOH, a shaman is probably a huge
advantage down there.
