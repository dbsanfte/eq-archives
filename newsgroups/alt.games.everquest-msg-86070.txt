The difference is that if you hit the right vendor you get far more
than you could in the same amount of time buying from players. For
example I've got like:

220 bone chips off one vendor

95 spiderling silks

48 plus high quality cat  (off a couple vendors by each other in ec..
got tailoring from 80 to 110 sitting on my bum making quivers, selling
quiver buying more hides from slots I cleared)

Off the gfay newb lift vendor I've probably got a total of 6,000 bone
chips to use in various quests for various characters. Auctioning to
buy from players takes one heck of a lot more time, believe me, and
you'd never end up with 200 bone chips.
