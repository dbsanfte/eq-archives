Seriously, aside for Kland/Zland (which are gimp mobs), and ToV armor
farming, what else is there at raid calibre that a shaman would
actually contribute?

Dain is 100% MR.
Yelinak is totally immune to everything except lures and dragon's
bane.
Cazic is 100% MR, unslowable, uncripplable--well, version 3.0 is.
Even VP is largly meaningless since the "hard" part is pulling
correctly.  Once pulled, it's a 30 second fight and a dead dragon.

Lend/Gozz/Telk are also immune to magic.

The only slowable "big" mobs I'm aware of is Statue of Rallo Zek and
Doezkar.

From the sound of things, his guild is giant allied meaning, those two
mobs are off the list of things to kill.

Shamans have invested a lot of time into their class.  Verant has
effectively made them a buff monkey at the end game encounters.  Most
of the players I know didn't invest that much time to be relagated
into that role.

Most end up starting a warrior or rogue or just quiting outright.
