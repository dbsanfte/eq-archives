The question of the ages.  I keep offering to let someone else do it just so
they can tell me.  No one will, though.

Ohh!  You mean EQ!  No, you respawn at your bind point (depends on what race
you are, at first, then whereyou are bound magically, later).  Until level
10, you will respawn with all your equipment and do not need to loot your
old corpse (except to avoid the embarrassment of seeing your dead body for
30 mins).

Once you hit level 10, you will experience the joy of a corpse run ("Anyone
got a SoW for a CR?" Always wondered aloud why they needed a pig.).
Basically, you respawn with no equipment and will have to run to the place
of your demise to reclaim all your worn equipment.  Bad news is you are
naked.  Good news is you have about 7 days total to find the corpse (best
thing I did early on was learn to do a /loc as soon as the fight started).
