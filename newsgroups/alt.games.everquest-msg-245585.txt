Ha!!  Every now and then I see a shout, "All <race/sex/class> guild forming,
PST!"  Gotta suck being in an all ogre guild and can't easily find a rez, or KEI
from a guildy.  :p

And to go back and defend Leet for Life, despite the title of the guild, the few
members of theirs that I have grouped with in pickup groups, played well, knew
what they were doing, and never used leet speak.  So I got nothing against them.
