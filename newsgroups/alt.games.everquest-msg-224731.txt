Kerafyrm is a dragon, who came from the forbidden mating of two different
kinds of dragons.  Very powerful, and it took the combined forces of all
the other dragons to defeat him, and put him to sleep in Sleeper's Tomb,
which they did because he wishes to destroy all the other dragons (except
Vox and Naggy, who are on his side).

He's guarded by several Warders in Sleeper's Tomb.  If you kill all the
Warders, it awakens Kerafyrm, who first wipes out everyone in the zone, and
then goes to several other Velious zones and wipes out everyone there.

Once this happens, he and the Warders are *gone* on that server, so one
guild or guild alliance gets to do this per server.  Since the mobs that
replace the Warders in ST drop stuff that many consider not as good as what
the Warders drop, and this was among the best loot in the game in Velious,
waking Kerafyrm was a controversial thing to do on most servers.  Many
people wanted to let all the top guilds farm the first three Warders before
anyone would do the fourth Warder (who is harder than the others, I believe)
and wake Kerafyrm.

The reason people did not expect him to die was simple: 2 billion hitpoints
and massive inate regen, hits for something like 6k, and deathtouches every
30 seconds.  A friend of mine who was in Legacy of Steel, the guild that
woke him on my server (The Nameless) pre-Luclin, tells me that they would
have been able, at level 60 in Velious equipment, to stay alive long enough
for a several hour fight, like the guilds on RZ did, but there was no way
to generate enough sustained DPS for that length of time to even make a
dent in Kerafyrm's HP.  With SoL and PoP, the high end DPS has gone up
enough that it can now be done.  For comparision, the top uber guilds that
woke Kerafyrm in pre-PoP days typically got him down to 99% health.

Each expansion has in many ways trivialized the high end content of previous
expansions.  For example, in Kunark, Veeshan's Peek was the top zone, where
only the very best dared enter...anyone slightly below the top would likely
lose a corpse or serveral.  My friend from LoS tells me that when he went to
VP with them, in the Velious era, equipped with all the best ToV and ST
gear, VP was *trivial*.  No dragon lasted more than a few seconds, and there
was basically no risk at all.  It was close to the point where a single
group could take out VP.

However, Kerafyrm was so over the top with his 2 billion HP and huge regen,
that it is still kind of shocking that he can be killed, even with three
expansions after Velious.
