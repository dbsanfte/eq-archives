Greetings Citizens of Norrath, 

With the announcement of EverQuest II, Sony Online Entertainment is
showing the incredible future of EverQuest, and how we want to take
online gaming on the PC to the next level. The question on a lot of
people's minds is what does this mean for EverQuest? Well, as all of you
know we're bringing out our fourth expansion, The Planes of Power this
Fall . It will add a whole new dimension to EverQuest, particularly to
the higher end of the game (although we do have a lot of other cool
things for lower level players). 

What about after The Planes of Power? We plan on keeping EverQuest
running for a long time to come, and those plans include adding more and
more features into the game as well as future expansions. In the near
term, you can look forward to a completely revamped interface. This
interface is going to dramatically change
the way people play EverQuest. We're getting rid of the old framed
full-screen interface and replacing the entire thing with an extremely
modifiable set of windows. Users will be able to customize the interface
with their own artwork, and decide for themselves what they want on the
screenï¿½ including things like the Experience Bar and a pet health
indicator. We're also adding in all kinds of new abilities such as
launching separate chat windows and simple inventory control. In
addition to the interface, you'll also see an all-new particle system
that will allow for some spectacular spell effects. We plan on enhancing
EverQuest for a long time to come, not letting it grow stale. A lot of
people have invested an incredible amount of time in EQ, and we
understand and respect that. We're not going to reward that by turning
off EQ in order to get everyone
to play EQII .

We've worked out a very great storyline and transition path for those
players that choose to check out EQII .  We will be announcing the
specifics of how descendants of your character(s) will carry on the
family name well into the Age of Destiny that EQII is set in. There are
a lot of other things that we plan on doing that will give our players a
real sense of continuity in Norrath. All of this is in the cards and
will be revealed over the next 6-12months.

I also want to announce that many of our Legendary Subscribers will be
the first to experience EverQuest II in its Beta sometime next year. We
will be giving preference to longtime Legends Subscribers, so my
suggestion is that if you're
interested in EverQuest Legends, sign up now. After Legends players,
longtime EQ subscribers will be eligible for a phase of the Beta as
well. I realize this information is somewhat vague, and the onlyreason
for that is we don't have an exact date just yet, but we should sometime
later this year.

Overall I'm sure many of you will have more questions. We'll be watching
the boards and taking note of common questions. We'll answer as many as
possible. We still need to leave many of the features of EQII behind
closed doors for now, but we will be gradually revealing just how
amazing this world will be!

Best,

John Smedley
