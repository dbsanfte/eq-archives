My favorite encounter with summoning mobs was in The Hole with a group of
guildies .. The shaman was hitting the mobs with Slow and some other
debuffs, which pissed the mobs off a great deal. The warrior was doing a
good enough job of keeping the Rock Golem taunted off everyone, but whenever
the Shaman sat, he'd get summoned and hit. After a while, he was just
getting summoned and not hit. After a few times, he just said "Fine, I'll
just med over HERE then!" Everyone got a chuckle out of that one .. I think
the Golem even cracked a smile. =P
