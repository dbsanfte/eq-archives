That was actually an interesting post, and a good read.  Hope you post some
more.  One thing I misunderstood in your intro was that you were "caught"
doing this and was waiting to hear of that gnome showing up in the story
again.  I would have done the same thing, only that I would have taken it
all I think.  Whenever I see a sac sitting on the ground I take it, the last
time I did that I ended up with 60 waters, lol.  You almost gotta do it to
keep everyone in check, because if people didn't loose things from this type
of looting then you'd see sacs all over the place.  I personally like
looting and rummaging around piles of the dead at someone's group when I
have nothing else to do.  Sometimes they dont loot their kill and you'll end
up with 10 plat all at once from a pile.  Hope you write more stories like
this.
