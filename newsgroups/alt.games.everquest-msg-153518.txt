It's going to hurt every guild, IMO, that's trying to move up
a tier.  Unless the tier was simply level-based, where the
same people with additional levels could kill it, mod rods
give the same benefit as better gear:  more mana, "more" clerics,
more mana-based damage, etc.  So, if you're trying to move-up
and kill mobs to equip your guild (instead of "farming" epic
drops, for instance) the guild suddenly got weaker.  It'll
make a difference to all the guilds doing "non-trivial" Kunark
or better encounters.
