Rogues.... hahahahahahaha

About the ONLY thing in EQ that *always* stacks well and *never* gets
complaints about adding, is DPS. Rogues do get plenty of utility if
they can be bothered to use it, in the forms of AA and poisons, but
even without that and the numerous clicky spells and potions available
they are simply amongst the best 2 sustained DPS classes in the game.

Nobody really comes close. Rogues do not need buffing. They keep
GETTING buffed, but even my rogue friends kinda shrugged sheepishly
and said 'well, umn, we're hardly going to say "oh no, dont let us
do more damage" now, are we?'

Rogues are so so so fine its not funny. Being the absolute best at
melee DPS is not insigificant *at all* in any stage of the game,
ever.
