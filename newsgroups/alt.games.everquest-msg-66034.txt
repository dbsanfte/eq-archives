I'm only newbie (L22 rogue) but even at this level once I saw FD
pulling in the hands of a skilled monk I knew it was something I
always wanted. Likewise he saved the group from a wipe when he
gave the run order and then tanked the mob till a last minute
feign. No deaths on what should have been a full party wipeout.

Mind you, i'd still prefer a warrior as main tank, but other than
that a monk is good value.
