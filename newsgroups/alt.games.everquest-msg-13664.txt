In addition to what the other guys have said.....

For your cleric, your spells, once inscribed into your book, become your
abilities, and you can never loose them.  They are your best investment.

For your level 1 spells, even if you don't use certain of them now, you'll
probably use them later as a mana-cheap method to increase your spell skills
(like casting True North repeatedly to get your Divination skill up, or
casting Lull on yourself to get your Alteration up).

At your level, I'd probably have (in addition to the spells you started
with), the following:
Strike, Flash of Light, Yaulp, Divine Aura.  Maybe True North if you get
lost a lot.  Maybe Spook the Dead if you like to watch decaying skeletons
run :-).  Don' t rely on Lull, as it is pretty weak and more likely to pull
a critter toward you...wait till level 5 and use it's replacement spell.  If
you're in trouble, use Flash of Light to blind the critter, and run to the
zone line or guards.  Just be careful using this method in dungeons, as you
can create nasty trains that way, as the blinded critter can gather a lot of
friends as it wanders blind, feeling around for you.
