Of the eight characters I have on Xev, only two are female (a mage and a
druid.) The druid has become my primary because A) When I try to
roleplay a male character, he just becomes me. I actually have to think
about roleplaying a woman, which makes it more of a challenge and
therefore more fun. B) Rosewhite was started as a whim, to let my "inner
Jewish Mother" out to play. Now the yenta refuses to go home. C) Pretty
early on, she got some VERY nice items dropped on her by kind hearted
high level characters. It would be inconsiderate of me to sell them or
hand them off to another persona :-)
