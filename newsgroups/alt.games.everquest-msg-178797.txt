** ANNOUNCEMENT **

The response to The Legacy of Ykesha(tm) extension has been
overwhelming; we want to thank all of you who have pre-ordered.

In order to better serve ALL of our customers, including those who do
not have a credit card, we've decided to make a relatively small
number of The Legacy of Ykesha CD-ROMs available at retail as well.
Please note, though, that The Legacy of Ykesha CD will likely not be
available at retail in the US until as much as a week or more after
the "live" date; the delay may be longer for our international
customers.

If you have already pre-ordered from us, but you would prefer to wait
for the retail CD, you can cancel your pre-order by following these
instructions:

1. Go to the Station Store (https://store.station.sony.com/)
2. Go to Billing Info and sign in.
3. View Current pre-orders.
4. Click Cancel button; you will receive a cancellation email.

You may still pre-order the digital download version of The Legacy of
Ykesha from the Station.com Store (the download version only - we will
not be selling CDs through pre-order) for the special pre-order price
of $17.99.

------------------------------

Note:  Some folks have had trouble getting the elves' beard colors to
work properly.  In order to get them to show up, you may need to set
DoProperTinting=TRUE in your Eqclient.ini file.  You can do that by
typing /dopropertinting in game.

ALSO NOTE:  We have changed a lot of UI Files.  Here's the list:

** UI File Changes **

EQUI.xml			 
EQUI_Animations.xml		 
EQUI_CharacterCreate.xml
EQUI_FacePick.xml
EQUI_NoteWindow.xml
EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml 
window_pieces04.tga	
EQUI_JournalCatWnd.xml - NEW FILE
EQUI_JournalTextWnd.xml - NEW FILE
EQUI_JournalNPCWnd.xml - NEW FILE
EQUI_BigBankWnd.xml	- NEW FILE 


** Interface and Gameplay **

- The melee button for Ulaks, Martial weapons and Two-Handed Piercing
weapons should appear to be depressed when attacking.
- Increased the size of the Notes window in the new UI.
- /viewport fixed.
- Fixed bug where action and hot-buttons for innate abilities would
revert to numbers (1-6) instead of their name when a skin was loaded
using /loadskin. It now reloads the names too.
- Fixed a bug that could cause a client crash if too many full
containers were open and the ALT key was pressed.


** Spells **

- Lowered the mana cost of Yaulp I, Yaulp II, Yaulp III, and Yaulp IV
to increase the value of these spells
- Theft of Thought works properly now, it was draining all of the
caster's mana, no matter who the target was.
- Damage over Time type Area of Effect spells will no longer do damage
when player character resists the spell.
- All pet spells will now get focused from any pet focusing
spell/item.  This means, for example, that summoning haste will work
on Beastlord and Necromancer pets.


- Fixed a bug that caused pet health bar to disappear if when trying
to charm when a pet already exists.
- Divine Barrier now does all of its healing in a single burst instead
of as regeneration.
- Removed the erroneous message "Returning to your own perspective"
that occurred when a character was changed into something using an
illusion.


** Quests **

- Dillon the Drowned should now respond properly when hailed.
- Corrected a problem with a 'quest' for the hermit in South Karana.
- Animist Poren now gives the correct recipe for his Handwraps Quest
(shadeling silk instead of shade silk).
- Noirin Khalen now gives out the proper jewelry book.
- Supreme Loachsmith Psorin now returns items that he does not need or
want.


** Items **

- Removed Rogues from the list of classes on the Elegant Darkwood
Katana, since it is a two-handed slashing weapon.
- Removed the "secondary" tag from the Flametongue, as this item is
for Int. casters only and they can't equip this item in their
secondary slot.
- The Nathsar Greatsword and Fester now have the proper inventory
icon.


** Tradeskills **

- Added new potions for Vah Shir Shaman (and all other Shaman):
Shadeweaver Portal.
- Renamed one of two items called Figwort.  The Figwort sold in Shar
Vahl has been renamed Ground Figwort to reduce confusion.
- Renamed one of two items called Drachling Silk.  The Drachling Silk
that was once no drop is now tradable and named Drachnid Silk.
- Adventurers have learned new techniques for fighting Cyclopes.
These great beasts are now much more likely to have their eye intact
when killed.
- Fixed the recipe for the potion "Soul of Incorporeal" to use a
"feather".
- Fixed the recipe for the potion "Troll's Essence".
- Fixed the cast time on any 5 and 10 dose potions that were
inconsistent with their single dose versions.
- General Bragmur in Iceclad should now avoid ice flows that he was
having a problem crossing in the past.
- Terrorantula Silk, Feather, branch of sylvan oak, branch of planar
oak, Drachnid Silk, and Drachling Silk are now stackable.
- Silicorrosive Grease is now tradable and stackable.
- Potions Aquatic Haunt and Serpents Drink no longer require reagents.
- Grandmaster Alchemist will now have a way to prove their ability.


** Alternate Advancement **

- Extended Notes now works on area of Effect songs as well as group
songs.


** PvP **

- Fixed a bug with Root and Snare spells that prevented the target
player character from being affected until they zoned.
- Fixed a bug with mesmerization spells being unbreakable by normal
means.


** Zones **

- Ikurenm the Sly should no longer disappear when trying to chase his
enemies.
- Repaired some "safe spots" in Echo Caverns, Paludal Caverns and
Grieg's End.
- Fixed a pathing issue in Kurn's Tower that was causing some NPCs to
disappear.
- The Golem Master in Charasis now looks like a golem.
- The Orc Arsonist will no longer have his torch disappear when looted
(as long as he had it to begin with).
- The Sands of Fire event will now be restricted to the intended four
groups.  Alternate methods of getting characters into the event have
been removed.
- Corrected doors in Kaladim, Blackburrow and Erudin that opened the
wrong way and one door in Kaesora that was way off its hinges.  Also,
the Dwarves have installed a door in one of their guard huts to
prevent drafts.
- Moved an oven in North Freeport that was poking through a ceiling.
- Wraith of a Shissar should no longer attack its compatriots, so they
should no longer be killing it in retaliation.
- Corrected some respawn issues in the Plane of Air.
- Rallos Zek is much less likely to need to leave the arena in order
to deal with his enemies...


** Miscellaneous **

- Changed "wode" to "woad" in the face picker.
- Corrected a spelling error in the text of the Purify Body ability
(affect to effect).
- PCs under illusions should appear with hair if the race can have
hair, even if the PC's race can't have hair.  Fixed a few other bugs
with illusions and their effect on hair and eyes.
- Vah Shir will now see "punches" when punching instead of "hits".
