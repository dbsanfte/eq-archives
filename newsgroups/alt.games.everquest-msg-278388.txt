That service is already implemented, but it is hit and miss.  There is
a thread on the official forums about it.  For some people, it worked
flawlessly.  For others, it took their money (real life) and didn't do
anything.

Apparently, there was a problem where it would create a level five
female mage with your name that was invisible to the world.  That
problem morphed into not doing anything.

My advice would be to wait until they get all the bugs worked out.
