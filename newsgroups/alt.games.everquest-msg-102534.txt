What actually threw me into a laughing fit was the notion of a warning
label.  For Pete's sake (whoever Pete was), we have "remove child before
folding" on baby strollers and "caution: hot" on coffee, I don't think we
need "This game was made to make the user want to play" on any video game.
I mean what company is going to set out to make a game that the consumer
doesn''t want to play?
