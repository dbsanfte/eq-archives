Err, the data never leaves my computer. It's still there. All that
happens when you "transfer" an item in-game is trips a flags their
character as having the item and yours as not. No data changes hands,
though.

A) In the example of CD's, the originals are leaving your hands. You
retain none of the "data".

B) The data for "Blade of Carnage" remains in your hands, just access
to it is closed off until you go through the steps to acquire access
to another.

See above.

You're not selling the original material when you're selling items
in-game for real money. You retain all of the original material.

See above again.

The plat is changed hands on their server, so a part of the whole
transaction takes place there. Therefore, yet again, they have say as
to whether or not you can perform the transaction there. Sure, you can
exchange the cash out of game all you want. But they can stop the plat
transfer.

If the stadium said no, then I'd say they're still within their rights
to punt your ass to the street even for transferring the product and
receipt/paperwork there. The flaw in the stadium analogy, though, is
the stadium doesn't own the merchandize being sold. If you were
hogging general admission seats and selling people those seats for the
game at the door, then the analogy would be a bit closer.

PART OF THE FUCKING TRANSACTION IS TAKING PLACE ON THEIR SERVER! What
part of that are you having trouble wrapping your brain around? The
exchange of real cash is NOT THE ENTIRE TRANSACTION.

The sale includes transfer of goods. I'd say the transfer "matters"
more than the paperwork in the transaction....

I would argue that you have NO rights in the ballpark that the park
doesn't give you. Private property. The fact that you CAN do something
doesn't mean you have the RIGHT to do it under any conditions or for
any reason you want. SOE has rights over their own property -- plat,
accounts, and in-game items are ultimately THEIR PROPERTY. Your rights
end where they start to tread on SOE's rights to say how their
property is used.
