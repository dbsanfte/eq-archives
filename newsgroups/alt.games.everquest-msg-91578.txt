    Two points: one, primal is a solid stepping stone to the better weapons
in places like NToV. People complaining about it not dropping as much are
mostly complaining that the fights to get the stuff after primal will be
that much harder. Two, it's all about the proc. The proc on Primal adds 100
to ATK - that is a HUGE benefit against any mob with high AC. Forget which
web site, but Hobben of Afterlife did some parsing showing increases in
damage output as high as 30% after he procced his primal. That includes his
swapping in a real weapon afterwards, but the difference bewteen a 13/20 and
whatever he swapped in won't make a 30% change. Even top guilds that have
much better weapons still swing those primals until the proc goes off, then
swap in the real weapon.

    For tanks, most of the new gear (and all the stuff dropping is pretty
slick, by and large) is weapon-based. A lot of it is also situational - no
need for your "strong snare" proccing weapon against a perma-rooted mob, or
a 700 Hate-proccing sword when you aren't main tank. The armour dropping for
tanks, that I've seen, is mostly in neglected slots like earring or range
(the chain BP from RoF being the one huge exception). Casters are getting a
fair chunk of Flowing Thought items, and also a fair chunk of pure crap
weapons. The spells are the big upgrade for casters, and they are very
worthwhile.

> Also, I'm going to assume that Luclin has been fully explored.

    That's actually incorrect. There's an entire zone, Vex Thal, that hasn't
been explored, and it is posited to be the "end game" zone for SoL. There's
also mobs in Ssra (Emperor) that have yet to be killed. So the jury is still
out on how good things are overall.

    We'll see. I think it could happen (Ssra is a nice place), but there's
some factors against it. The biggest problems so far have been the way VI
originally failed to put the content in game, or made the mobs be the end of
a long key camp / key quest. It takes more time to actually DO a high-end
Luclin mob than a Velious mob, and the Velious mobs still drop some very
nice stuff guaranteed. For example, the Dain will drop his head every time,
which leads to a belt that almost every caster and most melees will find to
be a significant upgrade. So guilds will continue to kill him because he's
guaranteed to drop something worthwhile, and it doesn't take too long to
kill him. The Itraer Vius in Luclin is about the same in terms of how long
the raid takes, but the fight/journey in will kill more people and his drops
are far from guaranteed quality. So if the two of them are up, which would
you kill?
