A L28 Warrior can solo fine if he has decent weapons.  A Warrior
grouped with only a healer is barely more effective than a Warrior
solo (at L28).

At L28 a Warrior's required group skills would take maybe five
minutes for an average chimp to learn.  Details about choosing
targets for particular zones/raids at higher levels are not
gonna be picked up killing goblins in HHK, so it really doesn't
make much difference at all if he mostly solos for as long as
he can (he's getting near the end of easy soloing anyway).

IOW, who the hell are you to rain on his parade?  Let him have
his fun fer Pete's sake.

That's true, but if he's having fun without minmaxing his xp then
there's no particular reason for him to change his approach at his
level.  Not everybody plays EQ as a race.
