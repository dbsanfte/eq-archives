Nope. It was obvious she was hoping for a PLONK. I never PLONK people who are
begging for it.

And, your attempts at claiming I am male will not work either. 

(Hint: Calling me Questor won't work either.)

It depends--is this NG the same clickish spawn that insists every play
according to the FAQ-approved style? Are any of your really silly enough to
stand up in here and deny, with honest conviction, that America is not a
democracy, based solely upon the fact we (and I am not making it up) "pledge
allegiance, to the United States of America, nd to the Republic for which it
stands..."

No, I am not making it up. Check Google. You had people on the soapbox ranting
I must be wrong we are a democracy because we are a republic! And I would trot
out references to show them we are a democracy, and a democracy can be a
republic just like a democracy can also have a king, and they would froth at
the mouth and again recite the Pledge of Allegiance.

You expect me to not killfile anyone that stupid?

Lokari eventually got the plonk because she would never come out and admit,
despite massive evidence she was wrong, that your EQ password is secure, as she
originally claimed.

>(Oops.. I saw she plonked you a little further down the page.)

He he he. See. You switched back to "she" when you weren't thinking about it.
You correctly believe I am female, and the "he" bit was just a feeble attempt
to join the other village idiots I have plonked.

"Stupidity is the most common element in the 
Universe, and one of the most destructive.
Fortunately, it tends to form a solid bond with
laziness, which is the second most common.
Without the abundance of laziness in the universe,
we might all be dead."
