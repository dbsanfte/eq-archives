What type of Raid Exp are you talking about the only ones that get Exp is
the group who does most of the damage. The rest of the raids groups get zip,
this is the reason when you go on a raid expect only a chance at loot only 1
or 2 groups (the most powerful) will suck up all the exp. It would be nice
if everyone got a share of the exp but they don't that is unless it was
changed since my last raid oh about a month ago. Raids are for 1 thing Loot,
weather its for you or someone else like an Epic raid.
