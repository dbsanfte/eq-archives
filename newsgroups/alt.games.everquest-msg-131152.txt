What OS are you running?

I seem to remember hearing something about Windows XP automatically
connecting to a time server and resetting the clock.

This is one of those weird problems.  I've never had it happen to me, but
I've gotten mail from people that say it happens to them all the time.  I
have no idea what could be causing it, other than some other program running
in the background that's resetting the clock on the fly...
