Yep, got confused there.  Was thinking 51 and 57, not 47 and 51.  In that 
case, well, I don't think I had Canni 2 until level 52, and, or course, 
Stoicism did not exist yet at that time, so was not even an option.  As I 
recall it pretty well sucked to group at those levels unless there was a 
real healer in the group.
