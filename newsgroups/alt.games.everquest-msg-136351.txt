Hey, do either of you have a comment about the suggestion that was made at
the time of this court decision that "the government get out of the marriage
business and leave it to the churches"?

Thought it was interesting since some in our church believe that we should
get out of the marriage business and leave it to the govt.  By that I mean
that we no longer be involved in the "legal" business of marriage -- much
like some countries in Europe (Germany springs to mind) where you first get
married legally then go to church to have your marriage convalidated.
