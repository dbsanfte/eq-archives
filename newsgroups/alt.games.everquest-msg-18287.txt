: Who is she, please?

From http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=1 :

Saxarivza Zexus is on PriestsofInnoruuk faction. There's also a Savarixza
Zexus in Grobb who must be her twin sister. She (both) gives a quest to
bring a note of recommendation to Perrir Zexus at the cleric guild in 3rd
Gate. Just delivering the note raises faction by several hundred --
apprehensive to amiable in one shot! It also lowers faction with the cleric
guilds in Freeport, Qeynos, and Felwithe, so use this quest carefully.

So it is not strange that she did not like you.
