Why get mad at Verant? A game is "a series of interesting decisions"... The 
fact that awaking the Sleeper generates so much traffic in this NG, both 
pro and con, indicates that whether to awake Kerafyrm or not is a pretty 
involved decision for all capable guilds, and anything that stops the high-
end game from being simply "camp mob, kill mob" can only be a good thing.
