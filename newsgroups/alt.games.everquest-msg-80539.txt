This is the second time we've had it happen now, with 2 successful ring
quests by other guilds in the meantime.. /sigh

During the first wave of giants, the quest dorf starts shouting to the zone
again ("hear thee hear thee.. your great city thurgadin is under an attack
to its very existence bla bla") and then everything respawns again (whilst
the current war is ongoing)

We had 4 wars going at once. and while it may mean 4 times as many dorfs...
you have no chance of killing 4 times as many giants on the second and third
wave.  And 4 narandis, well lol..

512meg ram, 64meg GEforce mx pro video card, and once all the extra
dorfs/giants spawned, the lag was so bad you couldn't even type properly.
