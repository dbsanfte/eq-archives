Ebay only has a lot to do with it if you've never experienced before.

The point is, to have characters of such a high level, you usually need 
to have played for a long enough amount of time to have experienced a 
patch before. Patches have happened since the game began, and will 
continue until they pull the plug.

To have played such a short time to have never encountered a patch, the 
logical thought is that you must have bought the characters- hence the 
ebay reference. Because your highest character is only 51, I'd actualy 
assume that you weren't ebayed- people who want to buy characters 
usually get higher level characters. Unless of course you've de-leveled 
to that point trying to learn to play them correctly.

There are of course other explanations. You could be an incredibly 
talented gamer who has read up on where to go to hunt- in which you 
should have read a mention of patches before. Or, you have absolutely no 
life outside this game and you are strung out on caffeine etc from lack 
of sleep because all you ever do is play this game.

Or you could have just been remarkably lucky and never actually hit a 
patch before. In which case you probably would have gotten more help by 
going directly to the EQ website and looking at the link that says 
"Network status" and you'd learn there that the servers were down and 
why. You'd have avoided many gratuitous insults that way.

Frankly, I don't care. But those are the logical things that the usual 
reader of a.g.e. will think. Protestations of innocence will only 
encourage others to think you are a fuckwad.

Hope this clears up your confusion.
