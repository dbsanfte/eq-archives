It all depends on the situation.  Back when Precia was in the twenties
(which, as slow as I level, was a while ago), she had 1hs maxxed out, so
when things were serious, or we were fighting undead, she'd have her
ghoulbane out, but when things were a bit less hectic, or we were limited by
available mobs, she was using the Shieldstorm that Veshoon lent her to get
her 2H up.  It's all a matter of knowing when you can, and when you can't.
