21 is max. I'd use points to train fletching, pottery, baking, brewing to 21
and get smithing to 10 or so. None in tailoring or maybe 1. The items made
in tailoring silk swatches and in smithing metal bits are needed for almost
every item above that anyway. Why train it then go make a bazillion of the
items anyway. Collect spider silks make swatches. Got to crystal caves
collect crysatalline silks make swatches. You will need packs and packs of
these items may as well get to the 50's skill making them.
I forget if smithing is needed in shawl or in ring to make knife.
