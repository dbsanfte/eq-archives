From the shadows, the mysterious TwoHead <th@2omar2world2.com> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>EQ is not an RPG because VI allowed the masses to make it so.  If Brad 
>had said "you know, I don't care if half or more of the players who 
>start out end up quitting, I am making the game I said I was gonna make, 
>an RPG" rather than enlisting Furor as his lead designer, EQ would have 
>been a much better game.  Of course it wouldn't have become the cash cow 
>that it is today, but that's sometimes the price of quality.

And for the future, other than SWG, no game will have the opportunity
for general appeal like EQ did - EQ had it because the competition
consisted of two games with gigantic flaws.

>
>I have little respect for Ben

SOMEBODY is still holding a grudge. How many months ago was that? Or
was it years? :-p
