Not really. I don't care about the effort involved in being a master
rug maker by some transient looking guy on the streets of mexico
either, am I going to pay him a premium price for his crappy rug
because it involved skill? Hell no, I'll toss some american change at
him and hope he takes it. 

Skill or your time means jack crap. Its supply and demand. I
personally think its great someone would pay you 100 plat (well
actually 3 someones) but If I knew them I'd have to ask "why? just buy
some toolboxes." 

Hmmm.. if people are paying 100 plat for tailor made backpacks, which
are mostly storage, I'm goingto get out some of the tons of deluxe
sewing kits I have and try to sell those for 100 plat, or get some
gnome toolboxes and try to sell those for 50 plat. 

Growing up has zero to do with not being a "mark" for someone trying
to price gouge for an item just not worth it anymore.
