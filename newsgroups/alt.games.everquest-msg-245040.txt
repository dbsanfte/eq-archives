Getting stuck in trees and other geometry is minor? Having half your
party see mobs stuck halfway in the floor and hence being untouchable
is minor (yet of course the mobs have no problems striking them)?
Having boats take off without you is minor (and rigging it with boat
gnomes is just a quick fix to a larger problem)? No, there are serious
issues still needing to be addressed here - potentially game stopping
issues. They apparently couldnt keep up with the /petitions regarding
getting stuck - so they added a chat room specifically for this.
Doesnt help much when you are stuck in a very dangerous place and cant
do anything to help yourself.
