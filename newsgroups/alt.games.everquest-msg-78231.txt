I recently went to EW and camped the rygor orc fort, while i was there we
killed the Chief, which i got to loot the Rygor BP and couple elite's which
i was able to also loot the leggings and coif. I switched out my crafted for
this, the ac is a little lower but the stat's (+10str on the BP) are nice,
so i was just wondering if I should use my old crafted till i get something
new or if the Rygor will do just fine?
