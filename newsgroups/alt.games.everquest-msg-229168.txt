HAH! Well quoth.

I can top that, though: I'm a 15-year regular on the lineal descendant of
the very first BBS that ever went live. That being CBBS at launch in 1978
(which was well before even my time), but it is now called Chinet. If I
counted the times over the years that I grumbled and swore that I wasn't
gonna expose myself to Chinet rudeness anymore....but it's an addiction to
being part of a community, however dysfunctional.

Several Chinetters are EQ addicts too, actually, the current conferencing
system has an EQ conference.
It's www.chinet.com/cbbs if anyone's interested, access is completely free
and self-selecting. If the sysadm wants to know, tell him "prb" referred
you.
