After my first foray into the GoD trials this weekend, I don't see it
happening.  There's just no way to balance a shaman for a dungeon
where even the minor named hit for over 2k, that won't utterly
trivialize all the other content out there. Any way that you balance
Shaman for 30 second fights would make them too powerful for 90 second
fights that are more the norm in places like PoP. I hope I'm wrong but
they'd have to retune most of GoD in my opinion and that isn't gonna
happen.
