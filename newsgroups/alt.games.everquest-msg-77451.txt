Just a follow-up to my post regarding Charming Pandos in WFP.

Yes, he can indeed be charmed, and KoS players can hand him muffins for EXP.
However, while charmed he gives NO faction boosts : (

I gave him about 200 muffins and he was still scowling.

I gave up because I couldn't tell if faction was being raised (just no
message given), or if I was just wasting time feeding the lil' bastich.

After that, I was going to try the 'trade and have friend cast invis on you'
tactic, but Pandos was seeing through invis. Even after a few debuffs were
cast on him.

Back to CB to collect Orc Hatchets.

Hope I can figure out a way to turn them in in Kelethin without aggroing the
KoS guy in the Ranger guild.

If anyone has succesfully repaired their Soldiers of Tunare faction, please
post your methods.
