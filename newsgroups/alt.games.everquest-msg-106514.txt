> And believe me I get my share of port requests as a (rarely anon) 51
druid.

I make it my personal mission to attitue-adjust these people. I am a 55th
druid and I am (almost) NEVER /anon or /role. I get requests for ports all
the time. I usually will reply "sorry, no" or reply with what I think is a
fair price. If they balk at that price, My suggestion is to usually find a
29th druid and offer THEM the 20p to port here and get you and port you out.
20p is alot to some players.. but at 55th, it isn't.

I get into alot of "discussions" with people, I feel its important they know
1. My time is valuable (If I'm 55th and you are 7th usually more valuable
than yours, sorry) and 2. No means No. If I said I won't port you, theres
nothing you can say to change my mind.

Also, as an aside, when I am contacted for a port, I do a /who on that
person. If they are anon, they get no special treatment. If they are 45+ I
will consider their request more seriously. If they are a Cleric or
Enchanter, most likely they are getting a port for free.
