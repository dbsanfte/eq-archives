I've got a GeForce2 GTS with 32Mb VRAM.  I've had no significant 
problems.  At least nothing I'd already gotten used to like graphics 
based lag.  And the graphics being displayed are much more clean and 
detailed.

I am looking to upgrade to an ATI Radeon 9200 or so just to improve the 
graphics lag I've got.  But, putting food on the table is more important.
