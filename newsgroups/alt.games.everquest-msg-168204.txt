I pay for KEI "after" I get it.  Usually you have to wait a couple minutes for
the group to be full or the chanter to med.  What if I go LD or something while
waiting?  I've never been asked to pay in advance, and I've never screwed the
chanter.

Hmm.. maybe... whatever... thanks for the correction.
