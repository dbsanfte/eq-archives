What is it with you american guys and Monty python :) I was in OT about a
month ago and someone sent a /ooc asking for the air speed velocity of an
unladen swallow :)
Not the first time its happened.

What cracked me up was when a guy asked me if faulty towers was a
documentary, then said that all English guys are crazy and funny.
Crazy...hmmm, yes! funny..nope, would you laugh if you had to put up with
english weather.

And we dont all live in big country manors sipping tea and ordering the
butler around, well i dont think other brits do :)

I had a point somewhere but i've lost it now, guess i miss EQ with the
british ISP im with being a complete bunch of wankers and screwing me out of
my hard earned cash :(
