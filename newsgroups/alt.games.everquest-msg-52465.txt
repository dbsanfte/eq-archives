then i guess we should all just go down into our bomb shelters for the
next 20 years.  education? screw it, it might train terrorists.  and
heck, everyone knows the mail system is just a portable anthrax

cigarrete companies. thousands and thousands die EACH year. but no one
complains, or even bats an eye. you need to be more realistic and open
your eyes to wahts going on around you
