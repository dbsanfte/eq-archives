was slow; as there was nothing to compare it with. Those who 
didn't play either hadn't been exposed to the game, or had been, 
but just didn't like it.

It wouldn't kill casual gaming... It would kill time-starved 
powergaming. Casual gamers are, by definition, comfortable with a 
slow rate of progress.
