The biggest problem I have is that the game just seems to run in slow 
motion. My character moves slowly, the mobs move slowly (or warp). I 
expect lag to be recognizable by skips and jumps (which I also see to 
some extent) rather than slow motion. Anyone else have any experience 
with this?

Completely unrelated question - for a necromancer, if the feign death 
spell completes, and I fall to the ground, does that mean it was 
successful, or is it similar to the monk's version in that it can fail?
