It if works like the bards charm powerleveling then (for the level 12's-17
at least) goto a zone like PC, beat the mob until it gets to about 5-10%
health, then memblur it, after this let your friends beat it up and they
should get the xperience, make it so that the mobs you are attacking are red
to your friends (but not by too many levels or they will have problems
trying to kill it off).......as soon as they are attacking the mob then you
should be focused on getting the next one ready to keep the flow going.

I could be wrong though!
