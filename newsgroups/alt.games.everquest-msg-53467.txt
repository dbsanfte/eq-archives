Well, for starters some more on the games main story.

Would prefer the storyevents, or small funny events over the "uber mob
with invulnerability show up, kill all newbies, kill all others in 20
min then swiths invulnerability off and get killed by the guild that
managed to get most people in the zone" kind of events.

Some sort of reward would be nice. Not talking big rewards, but just
something from being there, even a title would be nice.
Was at an event that lasted around 90 min from when i showed up. Some
gnome wanted to be bigger so he would have a chance against his old
enemy, so he needed materials for a spell.
All that happened was people throwing for around 100pp of random stuff
at the gnome that needed stuff for some spell, see the gnome get small
and big, see guard get small and normal, gnome take off. No battles, no
thanx from gnome, he just took off talking about improving the spell.
Felt kinda dissapointed in spending 15pp and 90 min on watching a gnome
get big and small a few times.
I brewed some fruit juice for the spell, even a "brewer of fruit juice"
title would have been fun.


So some reason to shop up for the event. Made more interesting quests
for newbies myself that that event.


And SOME way of stopping the extra 100 people on joining the event when
its going on. Sat and thought about locking a zone down, but that wont
work, just think of people running from trains in CB getting bounced
back in CB, or people not being able to enter EC.
Dont know how you could do it, but worht thinking about a litte.
