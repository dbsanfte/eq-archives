Odd, there is nothing out there that I can see.
Magelo has it lised and indeed it has not slot and is thus unequipable.
It was inserted (into Magelo's db) 09/2001 and updated in 04/2003.
Alakazims has nothing on it and this is the only post I can find refering 
to it.

Sorry I'm no help, you could try looking up the person you bought it from 
and asking them where they got it.
