The ports are currently bugged as they will port anyone in the area to Luclin,
not only those who have a shard on them.   I was there seeing a friend off,
waiting for our enchanter who had went afk, and we were all ported along with
the rest of the people.

In any event, if you can log the stuck character in, do so and type "/petiton
I accidently got ported to the Nexus and I don't have Luclin installed, please
come get me out."   Then wait until the GM has time to come release you.

If you cannot log in the stuck character, log in one of your other characters,
petition and explain the problem when you are answered.   It could take them a
while to get to you, so just be patient.
