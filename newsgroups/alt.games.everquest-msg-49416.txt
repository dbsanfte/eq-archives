This has been gone over so many times, it is a wonder so many people
still get it wrong.

The only facters in determining success at smithing an item are your
smithing skill vs. the difficulty of the item.

Regardless of success or failure, a check will be made against the
higher of your INT or WIS to determin skill up. If this check fails, a
"second chance" check will be made against your STR for skill up.

That's it. It's that simple.

This holds true for ALL trade skills, however, other skills may use
other stats for the "second chance" check for skill up. Then again,
they may not. This topic is discussed in depth at www.eqtraders.com
