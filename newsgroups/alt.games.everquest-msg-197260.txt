What you need is some regen, all you can get.  Also, you could look into
getting a shaman or chanter to come cripple mobs for you; wimp them out so they
hit less than they should.  What you don't need is ways to kill them more
quickly or slow the rate at which they hit you down.  Huge HP buff, lots of
regen, have them hit as fast as they like, because every blow is another shot
at improving your skills.

If you have a 45+ cleric friend handy, have him put on some Donal's Arms and
click away at you, and you can turn your attack and DS off entirely, just stand
there and let the mobs beat on you to their heart's content, if they are doing
less than 1400 hp per minute to you you'll never have to find another mob!

That said, hmm.  Old world mobs tend to hit lighter per their level.  You want
mobs that don't cast, by preference, and that hit fast but light instead of
slow but hard.  One suggestion comes to mind, how about Nektulous guards?  Drag
one back to the Lavastorm zone line so there won't be any pesky adds, and just
zone out whenever you feel close to death.  Since you can pull with Ensnare,
getting just one shouldn't be any problem.

Another popular mob is Ping Fuzzlecutter, I've heard him specifically mentioned
for this purpose as a melee only mob that hits lightly but fast.  Then again,
his "light" may be too much for you, I think he was reccomended for this
purpose to level 50 characters.  Or heck, its been a couple years, maybe his
melee output has been raised.  IF he's the way he was described to me, though,
he'd be red to you which should give you more defensive skill checks than the
blue route.

Or maybe you are supposed to stick to yellows for best odds?

Sorry this is vague, I've always made a point of keeping these skills capped
out.
