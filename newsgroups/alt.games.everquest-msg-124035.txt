I agree that the Necro, as with any caster, should not be tanking BUT it is
not rare for a solo'ing Necro to have to take some hits for his/her pet to
allow it to regen a bit (dead pet normally means dead necro). At higher
levels, I guess, this will have to stop because most mobs can drop a caster
in a matter of seconds and you are able to keep your pet alive much easier
with out having to resort to this.
Not sure you are going to find AC gear to really make this that much safer
on you. If you were Human or Erudite I would say Flayed skin but as you seem
to be Gnome then a Shardwurm skin (AC13 +4int) these things are meant to be
common drops from wurms in GD (didn't find them that common) you can pick
one up for 100pp or less from a player or about 40pp from a vendor in
Thurgadin or Shardtooths Flayed Skin (AC14 +35mana +35hp) similar price tag
from players. Also White scale leggings (AC5 int2) for another 100pp unless
you can find them on a Thurg vendor for less. These legs and both tunics
have a leather graphic so you'll not look like the normal Gnome Necro (My
High elf Enchanter wears them and keeps getting asked for Res's)
