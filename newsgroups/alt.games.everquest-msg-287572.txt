Ah, okay, I went back and looked harder.  It seems the "sort by date"
feature in the dxdiag window doesn't work reliably, it just sort of
shuffles the list of files semi-randomly.  But after I tried it enough
times it finally percolated some files to the top of the list that
were dated November 2007, so it appears I must've indeed picked up that
update sometime.

I'll update the FAQ.
