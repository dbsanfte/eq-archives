Sure, I read it. It just really didn't seem to apply to his *real
life* example. What was the point of his post if it was all a joke.
You're saying he was not at any point expressing an honest opinion
backed by honest supporting information?

Even if it was all in jest, it was still so very wrong. Some things
will just never be appropriate for "dark humor" subject matter.

Bah. Nevermind. I probably flew off the handle a bit. I have kids of
my own and their well-being is the one area I am always dead serious
about. Should have counted to ten (or a hundred) before responding.

Kenny, I apologize for the name-calling. I was out of line. First cup
of coffee in the morning (which it was for me) or eighth, doesn't
matter, it's no excuse. I could have expressed my objection in a more
civilized manner, and will endeavor to do so in the future.

Rumble <--- yeah, a bit of a grouch in the morning
