Kiting has been "nerfed" more than once, and quite some time ago.  I
assume from your comments that you were not playing before DoT damage
was reduced by one-third for moving mobs, which was a response to
pretty much constant howling from the player base about how awful and
unbalancing Snare/DoT kiting was (quite a few Druids and Necros were
routinely killing yellow con mobs with no risk unless they were very
stupid).  Summoning also served, in part, to restrict kiting of high
level mobs.  Given all the water under the bridge since then I'd say
that the way things are now is "as intended", seems pretty silly to
argue that Druids and Wizards using their snares and area effect nukes
in the most obvious way available is an "exploit".
