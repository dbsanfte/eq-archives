I have found this a useful little spell. It won't stack with the nife spell
but it processes quite often when I am fighting. I used invisibility potions
to get it. The bone is in the star shaped hole in Phinny's room about half
way down on a rock. I just kept asking around for info if anyone was doing
Kedge Keep for their epic and popping down there as well from time to time.
I got lucky on one visit as I met another Pally who had just got the bone.
He told me phinny was down and kindly went back in to lead me to it. Both of
us used invis potions. I gather phinny's down time is about twelve hours.
