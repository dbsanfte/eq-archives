You using a custom UI?  Whatever the first character you log in is using for
a UI, that UI folder must contain the target*.ini and target*.tga files, and
that will be the target ring that shows up, even if you switch to a
character that has a different set of target* files.  It only loads once,
the first time you log in a character until you totally close and restart
EQ.
