Oh, and a word to the wise, especially those in Freeport, sometimes being
a jerk in conversations when given a choice will produce a better result.
I might have made a mistake last night when returning a lost music box to
an NPC...she told me it was worthless but demanded it back...when I chose
teh "nice" option I found out that music box had a map in it, and got
almost nothing for the quest.

*bang head*  I'm guessing that the other option would have continued a
quest involving the map, or would have resulted ina  better
reward...trying to find out when I can get back on and get my hands on
another music box.
