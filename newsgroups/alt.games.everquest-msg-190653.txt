And I'm sure, if we search back far enough, we can find the patch
where they changed it from:

The group with the individual who did the most damage gets the xp,
to the group who had the highest aggregate damage gets the xp.

Yes, there was a time when a single wizard could KS from a group
without one, because his damage greater than any single individual
in the group that was attacking the mob.

Aha - found it -

To whit - from the October 13, 1999 patch message

"*  Experience and looting rights are now awarded for group aggregate
damage. This is now true for ALL servers. We still consider this change
in 'TEST' and will conduct a poll as to whether it positively addresses
the kill stealing situation in approximately 2 weeks."
