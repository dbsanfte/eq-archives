Hmm, yes.  I know this'll never happen, but I REALLY wish they'd make it 
easier to solo.  I'm hardly ever on at the same time, and everybody I 
meet seems to spend all freaking day levelling.  I mean I've played one 
night with someone and we're both 9, added them to friends list, comeback 
next night and they're level 11.  I play, level once more, go to bed, get 
up next day - they're level 15.  It's insane.  I stopped playing my 
shaman mostly because I'm so sick of pick-up groups at that level.  Ah 
well.  I whine too much about grouping, I know.  I would just like it if 
we didn't *have* to go through 10 tanks a night before finding one that 
didn't scream "HEAL!!!!" when they lost a bubble. :)
