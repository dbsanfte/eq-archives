My son bought a new Geforce 4 128 MB card recently and noticed
problems when playing Planetside (speckles of colour, some grass
leaves tall as lamp posts, etc.) and also colour splashes in text on
boot-up etc. He had that card replaced but now has the same problems.
In Everquest, characters are invisible - he can be in a region with a
dozen names floating around but no visible characters; on the log-in
screen the model characters are invisible and often the text on the
buttons disappears. Rebooting sometimes fixes this but the problem
seems persistent. Has anyone experienced this type of problem or has
an idea on whether this is a video card, monitor or ??? problem. I
just don't know enough about what the problem might be and I was
hoping that someone in this group might be able to help.My son would
appreciate any suggestions! Thank you!
