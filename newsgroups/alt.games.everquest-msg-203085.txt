Thanks TH and everyone else who comfirmed.  Grats to Ray on his flail of 
sparkles.

Yup, 2pm Eastern on Saturday.  If by chance we don't have the force, we 
will either do it later in the day or on Sunday at the same time. I won't 
be there if it's Sunday, but you can contact anyone in the guild on Sunday 
if you want to help.

After you snagged those UbahRare UbahLeet gloves from our Overking raid, 
our guild clerics may fiddle with your dice if you show. . .
