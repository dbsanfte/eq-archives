Ok, I was thinking of building an AMD 1900 this week, but I keep seeing AMD
"issues" with EQ...
Now, my question, are these issues covering all AMD procs? OR, is just a
certain family(Duron, t-bird, XP, etc.)??
I'm assuming there are people with AMD procs that are able to play the game,
so not sure if this questions can even be answered....I'm mainly concerned
with XP procs since that's what I plan on building....Is anyone here with an
AMD XP that's having problems?
