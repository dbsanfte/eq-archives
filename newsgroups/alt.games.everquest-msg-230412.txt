Yes, a player will nearly always sell an item for more than it is worth
selling to a vendor.

Many Lore items are worth nothing to an NPC vendor, but thousands to a
player.

They can, as you go higher in level cash drops are higher, you get more
no-drop gear so you have little outgoings, the plat builds up etc etc
(people also farm for cash in high drop areas).

> What also leads me to think this is the neverending adverts "40.000 plat

I am fairly sure the plat buyers are in the minority, I could be wrong
though :)

> Can items be obtained at such high levels playing normally

Yes.

In rare circumstances, yes, but is far from the norm IMO.
