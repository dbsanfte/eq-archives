Unbeleivable.

I would have quit  the day OoW goes live and I 
find mobs under the surface.

I am really tired of this very old bug,all the lovely
Hoppers in Mons Letalis under the surface since
Luclin came out,this was when ? 2001 or 2002 ?
And they had nothing better to do than throwing
out new expansions.
I sent them E-mail about this issue,maybe they actually read it.
