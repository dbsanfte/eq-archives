Thats a really nice list.  And I agree one hundred percent.  BUT....

Thats not the way it works in the real eq world.  Some people have
wonderful guilds and are sympatico with all and love it.  But most of
us just put up with our guild.

I think the comment about guild chat is the most apropo.  As a caster
sitting and medding, I really do like to watch chat.

At the high end, guilds are totally necessary.  Unfortunately so.  I
truly wish I could continue to enjoy eq and prosper without a guild,
but that cant happen post 55.

The worst thing about guilds is the bad feeling.  Every guild I've
been in has managed to make me feel bad about one thing or another. 
Solo I get mad at myself or at eq.  In a guild I spend a lot of time
getting bent about guild stuff.
