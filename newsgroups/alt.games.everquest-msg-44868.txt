I have heard here (no cite or even a name, hust rumor) that there is an
increased fizzle chance immediatly after a fizzle.
If this were true and it worked something like this :

If you fizzle then all spells for the next 6 seconds have a + X percent
chance of fizzling

Then after the first 5 or 6 the rest of the 40 would be trivial.
