Nah, shaman buffs are worse. Almost as if they were designed to make it
painful. They tend to;

1) Have really short durations. I think focus is 1:20 while most druid
and cleric buffs are longer.
2) Cost a buttload of mana and have a long recast (I'm going to exploit
anything by chaincasting focus?).
3) get group versions really late in a shaman's life. At level 54 The only
group buffs I have a resist disease, poison and strength. I think group
focus is something like 58 or 60.
