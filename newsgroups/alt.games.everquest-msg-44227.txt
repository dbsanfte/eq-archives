Rouges ??? I admit I don't know even know this game one third as well as
some of the regulars in the newsgroup but, rouges??? A shaman I can believe
but what does a rouge bring to the table in the high end game that is so
needed? I know about sneak and hide and the big old backstab (mana free
nuke) but are those really that important over a shaman buffing the crap out
of your group and all the cool regen spells, etc. ?

Willing to admit ignorance and wanting to learn more.
