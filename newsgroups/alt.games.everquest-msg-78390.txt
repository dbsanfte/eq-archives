yeah, harmony always works if you did it right, its never "resisted"
because its not a true mez but rather a way for a creature to ignore
that you are pulling something that is not being pulled past them. You
can harmony to your hearts content and if you pull wrong you are in
trouble while if you pull right it works every time.

Its therefore really a VERY powerful spell and one I find even useful
on xp mobs in Luclin and Velious as a 55 druid. You can pull that one
otter warrior out of 3 or 4 shamans, another otter warrior and even
the chief, every time.
