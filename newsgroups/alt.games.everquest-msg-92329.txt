Damn - I was dreading that. I already contacted Telstra at length and
enquired as to whether there was any special reason their 3 DNS servers were
all on the same sub-net and there answer was basically "what of
it?"....*sighs*

I did notice a tracerts failed due to "unable to resolve DNS..." and the
spelling wasn't incorrect - that stopped me in my tracks for a while
scratching my head. Anyway - their service fell over this morning so
hopefully in getting it up and running the troubleshooters are a bit smarter
than the maintainers.....*is hopeful*

Thanks for the info!
