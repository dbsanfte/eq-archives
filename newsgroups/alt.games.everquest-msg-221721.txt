Can be an issue - engage a caster mob, it casts on you without moving, 
pet comes running in, meanwhile you've run back to the group, now the 
pet has to be told to back off, but the mob keeps whacking it and it 
keeps whacking the mob back, then eventually it's low on health, and you 
all rush in to save it, etc., etc.

Except ..........

your SK engages them in position!  Which means his pet would have been 
very useful.
