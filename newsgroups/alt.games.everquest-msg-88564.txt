Tailoring got a big boost. I don't personally tailor but a friend does and
he said it pushed him through some of the rough spots in tailoring around
the 150 to 185ish. He has made alot of the acrylia studded stuff which has
nice stats but a little low on the AC side.
Have seen alot of new gems but no new recipes as yet.
