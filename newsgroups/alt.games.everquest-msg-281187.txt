Alright... so once upon a time it was your favorite shirt and you could 
wear it 24x7 without a 2nd thought. But the last few months, you almost 
hated the sight of it, found it uncomfortable, and thought it made you 
look fat. Most of would have just moved on without a 2nd thought. You 
seem, on the other hand seem to feel a need to rekindle your original 
infatuation with the shirt? Why!? Why do you care so much? Why don't you 
look for something else?

In my experience most (not all, but most) of the people who played it 
for 5 years and enjoyed it the whole time enjoyed it for the social 
contact and the friendships they made and maintained. That's the only 
thing that gives the game real staying power for years on end.

Sure some people enjoy endlessly exploring the minutia of the game, the 
same way chess fanatics dedicate their lives to chess... but you 
apparently aren't one of those people... no point in trying to force it.

You played it, you enjoyed it, you got tired of it... move on. 

No regrets.
