	That's not that good at level 58 for a Warrior, I believe....

|Lupine Dagger (1hp) procs greater wolf form (outdoors only)
|LSOEE (1hs)
|Ornate Runed Blade (2hs)
|Swarmcaller (2hs) proc targars insects 50 percent slow
|Ebony Bladed Sword (1hs) proc ensnare 58dd and root

	Throw out the ORB and EBS, you don't need them.

|I started using the Lupine Dagger in primary and LSOEE in Sec

	You should keep the LSEE in your primary hand; it has a better ratio even
assuming the elemental damage is 100% resisted.

|1) was it the speed of the lupine that caused agro in the first combo?

	Partly.

|2) was it the ensnare that caused agro in the second combo?

	You mean root, and partly, plus rooted targets will hit whoever's standing
closest to them, and if you're closer than the MT....

|3) was it not having a proc that kept me from getting agro in the last
|armorment?

	Probably the fact that the weapon blew chunks.

|4) My Swarmcaller was in the bank but does Targars Insects draw agro as much
|as the ensnare?

	At least.

	But your main problem is this:

|Guylan 48 Ranger

	48 is iffy for Kael to begin with, and you're 10 levels lower than the MT.
Mobs go after the shrimpy people first.
