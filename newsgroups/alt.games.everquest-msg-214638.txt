Me too, as you quoted below.

"Most areas I hunt" isn't the answer, if you want to solo as a cleric you need to pick your
targets, not to say "these are my targets, now what can I do".

Yes, you kill a DB mob, you med, you kill a DB mob, you med.  Its not speedy, its not an
efficient use of time, but it -is- killing DB mobs.  I thought you said you couldn't do
that, so I was contradicting you.  You can't chain kill DB mobs with no down time as a
cleric, I'll grant you that.  Oh, if you do root nuke routine you shouldn't have to heal up
after, thats a no contact sport, damage comes only from mistakes, among which would be too
small a fighting area.

You'll certainly get more exp per hour with almost any partner or group than you will
soloing as a cleric.  But thats not the same as saying it can't be done.

Melee as a cleric means taking out only the lightest mobs until you get up to your mid
50s.  With a pet, a proccing summoned hammer, and MOR, you can really rack up some kills
till 61 or so.  Before you get that summoned hammer, you need a nice weapon.  But if you
are going against casting mobs, a two hander isn't the answer, bashing is a crucial part of
the pattern, allowing you a shot at an interrupt that doesnt take up any of your melee
output or mana, and allows your workhorse spell, Stun, to refresh so you don't keep casting
Holy Might or higher spells, which are bad damage producers for the mana spent, take longer
to cast, and are resisted more.  Casters with pets are indeed trouble for a cleric to kill,
key strategy, avoid those.  But if you do want to kill one, just root the pet, kill the
caster, atone the pet and it vanishes; they never drop loot and are usually green so no exp
either, just get rid of them.

I might have misunderstood, I thought you were saying that while you were guilded you
couldn't get people to move on your epic.  Yes, without a guild, getting Chardok, Ixi, and
Ragefire would be a big problem.  Chardok most of all, it requires a real raid for most
people.  Ixi is the work of a half hour or so for a raid sized force, or twenty minutes for
a high level group.  Ragefire should be pretty easy even unguilded, because he has a shot
at some interesting loot, Cloak of Flames, and is very predictable, since his trigger is
always up within 20 minutes.

I agree, no guild, no epic, at least not till you are in your 60s with 62+ friends and can
go do the mobs as a single group activity.

Do you have all four pearlescent shards?  Thats the real stopping block, can take days,
weeks for a casual player to get four rare drops, and since POP people don't hunt there for
exp much.  So do hunt the zone yourself, solo or with friends, and at the same time make a
point of offering free rez to the zone and buffing and so forth, and that you are hoping to
loot the no drop pearlescent fragments if they drop for your epic.  They are useless for
non clerics save perhaps for a few lunatics willing to do most of the epic in order to MQ
them.  Getting all four would be a huge help when you do get into a guild again or assemble
that small horde of friends, having the long delay parts done puts this back into the field
of a single afternoon's work to epic you.
