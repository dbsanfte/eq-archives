Yes, tho simple kiting is a very easy skill to learn and the pulling
techniques I know (which do _not_ involve feign-splitting) are also
far from difficult to learn.  Anything that's easy enough to make
touch-typing look hard to learn just ain't much of a skill.

On the off chance that that's an honest question, and not just the
pathetic and ignorant jibe it appears to be, I'll answer it:
Designing and executing experiments in the field of nuclear physics
requires not only substantial knowledge in the field but also an
understanding of what can be done with existing and buildable
equipment, as well as the skills to build, if necessary, and then
setup and use said equipment.  Gaining knowledge from experimental
results requires advanced analytical and mathematical skills (which
also apply to designing the experiments).  [Aside:  mathematical
skills are real, else any dolt with a good memory could be a
mathematician, while the real world has many quite bright people
with good memories and significant knowledge of mathematics who are
not mathematicians.]  Much of the work in nuclear physics involves
very substantial electronic engineering and software engineering
efforts to gather and analyze the data sought to test theoretical
work, and the theoretical work itself requires substantial skill
in analyzing prior observations and devising testable explanations
for those observations.  Writing and typing are to nuclear physics
as pressing the on/off button to start you computer is to playing EQ.

Only in the useless sense that saying anything is like saying anything
else.  The words "knowledge" and "skill" are used to describe distinct
things in our language for a reason.  That in at least some sense they
approach one another and end up with a gray boundary region there does
not make them identical.
