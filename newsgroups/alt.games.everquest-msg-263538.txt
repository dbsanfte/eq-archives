It looks like the video card was not the source of my woes (am now replacing
ram/m'board/cpu) but this is useful information as my graphics card really
could use an update and the price of the 9800 pro seems quite reasonable.
The new graphics are fun but i often turn them off so i can 2 box anyway.
However, when grouped (something i'll have to do more of, 59 druid and 57
monk are reaching the limits of what they can fight) i'd rather have them
on, except for shadows which can be distracting. The shadows go through
walls and so on and sometimes i think they could be used as an exploit
although I'm not sure how. I'd only ever run a resolution of 1024*768, my
eyes have trouble with the text otherwise. I have a 17" monitor.

I'm going to buy the following: (Aus dollars)

I'd like more ram but i'm not sure if windows really uses it; i didn't
notice much improvement between 512 and over a gig in sdram, and the modern
motherboards won't support my that ram, so...
