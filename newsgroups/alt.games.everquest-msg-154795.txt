You may be the guild leader but you will never be made the guild OWNER. 
  The person who made that guild will always have his account tied to 
your guild.  That person can decide to have Verant reinstate him at any 
time and then disband your whole guild with no notice or recourse.
If you want to keep that guild together, make a new guild with you as 
the owner.  Use a similar name, don't think you can have the same guild 
name but it can be similar.  Or think up a totally different name.
If you are a good leader, then the old problems will disappear. If your 
guild wants to stay together, then they will support you in making a new 
guild.

The guild leader versus guild owner comes from PERSONAL experience.  My 
old guild was disbanded by the vengeful owner.  None of the leaders 
would let her back in the guild so she had Verant reinstate her and she 
totally destroyed the guild.  After walking around a few days going what 
the F*** happened, we dusted ourselves off and made a new guild.  Good 
riddance to the old guild name.
