Hmmm... if you ask me, scalable content should be... well... scalable.

For what its worth, I think regular 6 person groups are really only 
viable in higher level guild scenarios (which is where most people do 
fall). But putting together a 6 person pickup group, or putting together 
a full group at 20th or 30th or 40th level is almost unrealistic. Pickup 
groups are perpetually losing people at the best of times, and lowbies 
are rare, and as often as not solo PLees.

60 minute on-demand 'events' sound like a godsend for pickup group type 
players.

I dunno. For the most part anything a 4 person group can take at level 
X, a 3 person group can take at level X+n where n is pretty small. (not 
taking AA into account, but you get the idea) Getting smaller than 4 and 
you do start having functionality gaps (no healer, no nuker, no 
tank...no cc, or something) but even a duo is viable for most things, 
provided its the situationally right duo.

Naturally this breaks down somewhat at the endgame, as you simply cap 
out at 65, and AA aren't the same as levels in some key respects. And 
many encounters do simply require 4+ or even 40+

But here we have 'scalable content' that will provide challenging but 
doable dungeons for groups in their 30s (or was it even 20s)...to 
dungeons difficult for elemental uberguild groups ... surely somewhere 
in that continuum there is an appropriate difficulty for groups of three.

Let me clarify sub-optimal...

For example, my brother and I have an untwinked human bard & erudite 
paladin duo that we play together somewhat regularly around 32nd level, 
and we're crawling back and forth through Sol-A the last couple sessions 
with them (doing the lambent quests), and its just a blast (we arrived 
at 30th, and made a level a night). Sure, we could add in a druid, or 
necro, or rogue, or cleric, or X, and we'd push through it a lot faster 
with a lot less risk... but the entire fun of it is just squeaking 
through the adds and the casters, and hanging out together.

For the most part we only ever see 60+ chars in SolA camping some item 
or famring plat, and have only once seen anyone else in the 20-40 range 
there (and we did group with him for a couple hours), but clearly its a 
sub-optimal way to play, otherwise it would be a bit busier in there.

It would be fun if we could do the same in LDoN... but we can't because 
SOE has arbitrarily decided we're not allowed to.

And even my more regular group of 3 is excluded from LDoN, unless we get 
a tagalong.

Again, I'm going to appeal to 'scalable content' to postulate that it 
*should* be able to scale the difficulty so that anyone can do it, and 
be appropriately difficult for *anyone*.

I'm glad its not just me with that observation.
