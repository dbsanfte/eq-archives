Almost certainly. While movement resolution is serverside, movement
control is clientside and therefore no matter how bad your lagmeter
goes you are *always* smooth, even in the midst of going linkdead. Lag
has no effect on the control of your character's movement.

If you press the arrow key and the screen doesn't update, then its a
degraded framerate.

"Bad enough when the dead come walking," he said to Jon as they crossed
 the village, "now the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will
 come of *that*, I'll warrant. And who's to say the bones wouldn't lie?
 Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely
 dull fellows, full of tedious complaints - 'the ground's too cold, my
 gravestone should be larger, why does *he* get more worms than I do....'"

- Dolorous Edd Tollett, "Clash of Kings" (George R R Martin)
