I got a 75% percent res after inspecting the sole of Cazel's shoe as a
cleric saw what happened and offered to help - I payed him back a stack of
peridots. That was the first res I have had in 3 years casual playing and I
actually had to ask if it get's cast on me or the corpse.... : 0

All up the Chimp has died six times, and is still half a blue below 55, plus
I am getting some AA xp as well. All in all, nothing to call a setback. I
think that just finding the corpse, re-equipping and getting straight back
into the fray without spending ages hunting for an XP res makes up for a lot
of the lost time.
