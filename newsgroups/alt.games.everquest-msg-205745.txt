You like it safe and need money too ?

Try Marus Seru at Seru zone,greyhoppers are running parade there,
they drop greyhopper hides,which go for 5p in bazaar, OR they drop
low quality rockhopper hides,which can be used to make leather
paddings in combination with shadeling(not spiderling)silk.
Shadeling silk is easy to find in Shadeweavers thicket,drops from
mobs in newbie zone,either Xakra silkworm or lesser shade.

You are close to 24 ? - means you can hunt greyhoppers for 5 or 6 more
levels until they begin to green out,which will net you around 125 
lq hides.
Going price in bazaar is 25p per padding,so at level 30 you will have
around 3k ! - pretty nice,I would say for that level :)

To give you an idea whats possible with leather paddings,my 
Level 39 Ranger,can farm them for 2k to 3k an evening,more on
weekends.
