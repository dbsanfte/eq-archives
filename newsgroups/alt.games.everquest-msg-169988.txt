I'll agree to disagree here.  Some players get more entertainment out of
their style of roleplaying that anything else, so to them it *is* the most
important thing about the game.  The only thing I'd consider rude would be
if they forced you to listen, e.g., spamming /shout with it or following you
around or something.  If they're in your group and they want to continue,
you're free to boot them.  If you're in their group and you don't like it
then leave.  But as long as they aren't following you around and cramming it
down your throat they're not being rude.

Erm... d00d sp34k is a sign of deliberate stupidity -- saying "sp34k" as
opposed to "speak" says absolutely nothing except that you (the player, not
the character) are a moron.

RP speech, as you put it, is a specific way of communicating intended to
present a story.  You may not consider it a *good* story, but at least
there's creative reasoning behind it.  That's like comparing a speaker you
don't like to someone who makes all his speeches backwards because he wants
people to think he's cool.
