I think this would be very interesting! I wouldn't care if there were
any mobs at all. I would use it to simply walk around zones that I know
I would never ever be able to visit in real EQ. Then I might understand
more of what is being talked about around here.

I was also thinking the when EQ finally dies in favor of whatever is to
follow, that it would be nice if during the closing weeks, all pertinent
data files were allowed to be stored locally instead of on the EQ
server. Probably a dumb idea, but if I've become so "attached" to my
lowly characters, I can only imagine what it is like to have lived
through 65 levels with a character.
