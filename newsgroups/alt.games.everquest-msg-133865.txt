We had 2 epic wizards pulling.  Wizards epic is a right click rune which is
nice for things like this (my wizard didn't have run 3 though, which would
have helped a lot)

I went left, the other wizard went right.. basically Flux-staff the first
room (about 8 mobs) and run back to base, the chanters AE stun would then
hold them all in place, while I re-cast epic and went looking for another
batch.

Rinse and repeat till we had enough mobs, then when we finally have
everything thats popped, in pullable distance, make sure they are packed as
TIGHTLY as you can, go stand right in them, and chain cast your PB ae's

Pulling a HUGE amount in 1 isn't all that easy...I did an improvised Droga
ae group the weekend (my monk, my cleric, a friend 59wiz) and if I had a ton
of mobs, half just would not follow.  If I had 10 inc, and took them to a
2mob pop (meaning 10 mobs) half would just turn back home.  Kinda
irritating, and with no chanter there I couldn't keep mobs held in place to
find more.

I think had I been a lot lower level though (or the mobs a lot higer so that
agro chained).. I could just shuriken the first 1 and have all of them
following, out of melee range
