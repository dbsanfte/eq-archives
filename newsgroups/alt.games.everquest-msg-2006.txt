Remember?  Heck, I still have to do a fair amount of coding in some
bollixed-up version of Fortran and/or Ratfor on a VAX.

We're scientists, we never upgrade. :)

But yeah, I really miss the days when tightly written code was actually
valued.  As opposed to the modern day, when if you can get it to compile
once without crashing it's apparently good enough to market (with no
access to the source code, no less...)
