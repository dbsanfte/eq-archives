The lvl 60 guy might have been exagerrated a bit, I don't think he had his

And you're sounding like a total newbie, if you join a group full of people in
the depths of Sebilis, you're not gonna start putting them on ignore unless you
seriously like screwing yourself and your group over, even if they ARE

they're actual things I remember hearing my group say, some of them at various
times.
