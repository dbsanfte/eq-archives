I Noticed this message when I was creating My handwraps,

It was explained to me that ,
 (a)  I had failed to make the wraps , hence the Lack of Skills message
 (b) The Pattern is returned to me and not destroyed , whish gives the nade
something new message.

You get the same messages when doing the tailoring quest , trying to make
belt straps with the
LORE knife that you are given.
