Have you ever fought them?   I have.

They spawn 4 at a time, run nearly sow speeds, are extremely magic
resistant, and are undercons.  HP and offensive stats much higher than they
should be for the level that they are (and exp gained is based on level,
reguardless of how hard the mob is.)  Even if you can kill them, they aren't
worth the time.
