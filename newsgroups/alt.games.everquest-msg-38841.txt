   As the subject says, I can't see the Velious
armors.
   I didn't really realize it till I got married
this weekend, and realized that the Rygorr BP I
got for Tealeef looked just like banded on her. 
I look in my EQ ini file, hoping I would find some
lines that looked like "Armor_blah-blah=FALSE"
and could set them to "TRUE".  But I didn't find
much beyond the chat colors settings.  Am I 
looking in the wrong place?  Do I have to download
the settings from somewhere?  I have run the 
optional and Velious patches recently, an am going
to do so again.
