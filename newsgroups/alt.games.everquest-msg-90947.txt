Bothers to let them play, when really they could instead not sell you
the product and block any international IP traffic/accounts. I'm sure
you'd NOT complain about that at all (AS IF)

They don't really provide tech support lines for US customers either
;)

See above, you CHOSE to play an mmorpg based in the US. You don't have
to do so. If I played an mmorpg based in Europe or Japan I'd expect
the same things.

Your server is LOCATED in europe, its still patched and such on a US
schedule with is their pacific time schedule.
Gad, would you rather not have a server located in Europe at all? I
knew that was a mistake.. jeez they give the international crowd
something GOOD and they complain.

Again, see above, not really getting it yet are you? Its a USA mmorpg
on USA soil where the people from the company can easily travel in the
continental US.

Not a very good comparison at all.

Your assumption and expectation that things should somehow be
different is wrong. We live in the US and really don't get better
service ;)

No, its too easy. I do have a pet peeve about people using "your" for
"you're" or "you are." They are too fully different words/sets of
words. "Your" is always possession is a good way to remember it. This
does not even seem so much like a grammar or spelling mistake to me as
simply being lazy. If you just thought about "your" being possession
you'd see it makes no sense in the above sentences, yet you do it
twice! No one thinks you own a "the sad pathetic whiner" or a "the old
boring one."

I can spell "exercise."

I've know five year olds who understand how to use contractions like
"you're."

Okay, oh wait I guess I will put a quote there.

"your   Pronunciation Key  (yr, yï¿½r, yr; yr when unstressed)
adj. The possessive form of you. 
1. Used as a modifier before a noun: your boots; your accomplishments.
2. A person's; one's: The light switch is on your right. 
3. Informal. Used with little or no sense of possession to indicate a
type familiar to the listener: your basic three-story frame house. "

I AM HUGE TRUE NERD PERSON!
