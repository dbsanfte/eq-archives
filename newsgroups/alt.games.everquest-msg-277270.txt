Check your hard drive.  Run a scandisk or checkdisk or whatever Windows
calls it now.  It sounds like you may have a bad hard drive and the
computer cannot read that file.  If you encounter any problems with
your drive, I would highly recommend getting a new one immediately and
begin transfering important files.

Other possibilities...not really sure.  A virus shouldn't target text
files, but you could always run a virus checker.  (If it tries to scan
the bazaar.txt file it may give a similar problem and freeze the
computer).  Can you rename the file instead of deleting?  Check the
properties, is the file marked as read-only for some odd reason?  These
are longshots, I would check for a bad hard drive first...
