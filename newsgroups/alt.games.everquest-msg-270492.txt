Geeze Dark, lighten up will you? When the discussion degrades into name 
calling it becomes obvious that no point is being made at all other than 
one about your own level of patience with others. Surely you have some 
if you like social games like MMORPGs right? Give the guy a break. I was 
critical too of bitching about this but I don't think the guy is an 
asshole for being upset about it even if I do disagree with him on that 
point. Although I haven't spent a lot of time on USENET I do find it 
amusing sometimes how tough people can be on each other. It's a wild 
world here. LOL. But I guess when you can say whatever you want without 
any fear of repercussions, it opens new doors doesn't it?

Threads like this are pretty funny sometimes as long as you have a thick 
skin when you're the one taking the heat. And from what I have seen so 
far there is plenty of heat in the USENET kitchen.

The other gentleman's point is a good one about EQ2 users (although I'd 
extend that to any gamers) being impatient with problems. Gamers are 
notorious for being fickle demanding and often unreasonable customers. 
Everybody wants perfection while nobody is ever going to get it. It 
makes for a lot of fun reading though.
