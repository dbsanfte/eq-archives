Also, you can install as many copies of EQ to computers as you want
to.. in fact they know and want people to install it at home and work
and their aunt's house or wherever they play. As you say, only the reg
key determines how many accounts you have meaning you have to buy more
product to have more regkeys/accounts. You can't play EQ on more than
one computer anyway at the same time unless you have more than one
account since an account can't be logged into more than once at the
same time.

Legally is only an issue for a single player game, even then its a
dubious legality at best since I've not heard of shrinkwrap game
agreements being upheld in a court of law. Only businesses who might
be investigated have to worry about having multiple copies of the same
shrinkwrapped contract application such as operating systems/microsoft
office, etc.

In the EQ license it has something similar (for various legal reasons
probably and protection against naughtiness) to what single player
shrink wrap agreements say but the one thing missing is the "installed
only on one computer" or "must purchase one copy per computer"
stipulation because of course you need a purchased account login and
password to play at all:

"7. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, we hereby grant to you a
non-exclusive license to use the Software solely in connection with
playing the Game via an authorized and fully-paid Account. You may not
copy (except to make one necessary back-up copy), distribute, rent,
