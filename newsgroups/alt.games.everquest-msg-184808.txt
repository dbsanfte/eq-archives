Bazaar has a 500 person limit.  500 people set up afk traders while they go
to work, sleep, raid on another account, etc.  Do you have to camp the
Bazaar until a server reset to get a spot?  Do you think people would
complain more if they had to do that or if they occasionally got randomly
dropped?

As for backing up my claim, it's right there in the paragraph I wrote.  I'm
not hiding anything, I'm just only letting the intelligent people figure it
out.  :)
