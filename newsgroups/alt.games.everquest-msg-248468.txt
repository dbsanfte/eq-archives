I would recommend the Everquest Evolutions pack instead, I'm in the UK and
am in the same position as the original poster. I considered New Dawn but
it's restricted to UK servers and Evolutions has 5 expansions with it
instead of 3.

 It isn't actually available in the UK but you can pick one up on Ebay US
for about the equivalent of �22 with 4-6 day delivery, there's loads for
sale. Should have mine by the end of the week! :D
