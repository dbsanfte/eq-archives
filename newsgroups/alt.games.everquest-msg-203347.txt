My main is a 59 Vah Shir Shaman, with my channneling maxed i don't get
interupted very much from frontal attacks, maybe its just luck.  As far as a
JBB, it has been unattainable for me for quite some time, cost wise and
finding some one selling one on Lanys.  Now that i have my epic, it takes a
little more time to take a mob down, but the JBB is not needed for soloing.
The innate sneak came in handy in Crystal Caverns before they added faction
to the dwarfs, as had innate ultravision in all dungeons.  I didn't buy my
first vision spell till well into my 40's, and only to buff a barb guildy.
With AA regen and any of the regen line of spells, innate regen didn't
matter.
>The race doesn't matter one iota.  By far the most important question is,
how good is the player at playing a shaman

I hold this statement to be true of any class, but with shaman it is persnal
choice as to which race you choose, everyone has their own opinion on which
one is better, but yours matters most to you.
