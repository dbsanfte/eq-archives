What an absurd pair of questions!  Still, out of the goodness of my
heart I shall humor you by answering them.

First, everybody knows that these PoP items are crafted by crews
of 'bots purchased off ebay with the $$ that facist guildleaders
get for selling off all of the awesome raid lewt they send to the
"guild bank".  Leftover funds finance extensive pay-per-view porn
setups and regular trips to Thailad to have sex with young boys
in doorways.

Second, the tunic is crafted from drops that all of the pathetic
lickspittle followers of these queer-fascist-homophobe mama's
boys have been brainwashed into believing are worthless and
destroyed by the "loot officer".  Then, of course, the evil plot
is furthered by selling the crafted items themselves, further
enriching these no account, scum sucking, self abusing, baby
rapers.  And don't even get me started about the kickbacks to
the moles on the dev team...

Is everything perfectly clear now?
