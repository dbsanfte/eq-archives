Dude, there isn't now either. Seriously, I wouldn't drop any bard level for
a few levels of another class. Even being able to rez wouldn't be worth
losing even one bard level, much less however many would be needed to
get the first cleric rez.

OK, maybe one bard level, for some, but I wouldn't go for it. EQ is a
grouping game, and I'd rather be dependant on other classes than be a
worse bard than I can be.
