My friend once found a manastone on a vendor in WC - someone must have
sold it instead of a lightstone by mistake.  For those of you who are
new to the game, manastone converts hp to mana, and no longer drops in
the game because it was consiered unbalancing.  A cleric had unlimited
mana with these stones because they could CH themselves, manastone
down to recover more mana than he spent on the CH, and keep on
repeating.  Oh, and you can cast manastone while moving and it has not
cast time or delay.  You hardly ever see these for sale, and last time
the asking price was 60K.
