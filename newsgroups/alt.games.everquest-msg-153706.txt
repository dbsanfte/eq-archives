You've heard me talk about the E'ci public raiding...   well, for the first
time, public raiders are regularly going to VP.  This means that a *lot* of
level 60's that previously had absolutely no use for a VP key find
themselves wanting / needing to do the quest.    Also, since the public is
killing Trak for teeth, that means the last piece is no longer quite as
impossible to get as it once was.  So even people who don't regularly raid
with the public are pushing to complete it, and then just going on our raid
for the tooth.  All in all, it's about an extra 80 or 90 people suddenly
trying to complete it at once, in addition to the usual "guilds that just
reached VP level".


Trak suddenly moved back into the "contested spawn" catagory, and all of the
VP key pieces became much more camped.

It's not as bad as other parts, but it can be a pain.

I realize Verant has come out with much worse timesinks since then...  Just
because the Serubane quest and VT key quests are COLLOSAL sucking wastes of
time, doesn't mean the VP quest suddenly became less annoying than it
previously was.
