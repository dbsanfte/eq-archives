When my wife was temping, one of her jobs was at
a law school.  One day the phone rang, and the following
conversation ensued:

   Wife (answering phone):  "Hello, South Texas College
            of Law, may I help you?"

   Caller:  "Does the College have a book store?"

   Wife:    "Yes, it does."

   Caller:  "Do they sell books?"

   Wife:  {Unable to answer for a few moments while pondering the
          stupidity of the question}
