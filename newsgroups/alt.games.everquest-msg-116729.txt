I *AM* a human ranger.  And yes, night blindness is a pain, but hardly
a debilitating one.  A fire beetle eye is more than enough light to
make it around.  A lightstone, which can be had off a vendor if you're
lucky to find one for a whole plat, is WAY more than sufficient.

How so?  My human ranger more than holds his own against his 'elven
brothers'.  I can even steal aggro off of similar level Paladins and
Shadowknights, and occasionally an under equipped warrior.

I dunno about that.  I made my ranger a Tunare worshipper, so I can't
comment on difficulties Karana based rangers might have.
