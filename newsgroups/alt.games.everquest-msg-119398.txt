That sounds like something coming from the "great knowledgeable american
government".  That would be complete miss-information (unless they stated
that Pi was equal to 3, if rounded to the nearest whole number, which would
also be just as, if not even more stupid considering that is already the
case).  I'd consider passing a law stating that Pi is equal to 3 (not
rounded) just like making a law that says 1+1=3.  Or making a law stating
that Pi rounded to the nearest whole number is equal to 3, would be like
making a law that says "under natural conditions (excluding magnetic field
or other interference), an object which for it's volume is heavier than the
volume of it's surroundings which it displaces, gravity shall pull it
towards the earth.".
    Just like about 3+ years ago, I heard on the local radio, that an
organization conducted an investigation, and concluded that people who use
drugs and alcohol, as well as commit crimes, or have discipline or
behavioral problems, before the age of 18, are more likely to have problems,
or do same, similar, or worse things after they reach the age of 18.  Who
figured this out?  The "DUH!" institute?
