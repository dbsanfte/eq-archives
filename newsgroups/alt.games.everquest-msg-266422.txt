Pick a substance you know you are not allergic to, most people 
are not allergic to the standard red food dye. If someone takes 
your own meal, it would be the same as if you added mushroom 
gravy or coconut, you were modifying your own food. Shrooms will 
kill me, and coconut makes me wish i was dead, so I avoid foods I 
know dont have them, or suspect might have them, and I dont steal 
other peoples food, so I am safe from your shroom modified pot 
roast. If I were to take it without your permission, then my 
death or illness is my fault. I am certain if I asked for some of 
your food you would tell me you had added the shrooms/coconut, 
and I could then avoid the problem. If you dont want to add dye, 
add that wicked nuclear hot sauce, the obviously you modified it 
for your personal taste, and didnt feel like schlepping the whole 
bottle to work...and the really unhappy person with the serious 
case of habanero mouth will either be very reluctant to eat your 
food, or noticable uncomfortable for a short time.
