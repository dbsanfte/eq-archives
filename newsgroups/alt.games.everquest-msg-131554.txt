      Just a FYI note for all those nVidia GeForce folks

      If you update your GeForce card drivers to the newest ones, 29.42 in
this instance, please do install the latest 4 in 1 from VIA if you are using
a VIA chipset. This is crucial, and EQ should post this on their driver
compatibility we page. This step is absolutely necessary in order for the
new drivers to work, and this is especially true if using old AGP VGart
drivers, such as the ones that came with your motherboard CD drivers disk
you bought in 2000 or so ~

     Hope this tid bit helps someone avoid the hours of time it spent me, an
experienced computer enthusiast, pouring over every possibility

      John
