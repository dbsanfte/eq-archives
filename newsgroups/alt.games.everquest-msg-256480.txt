No it isn't. Best haste is enchanter haste. But *g* bards provide
overhaste. That is a special haste song that stacks with the usual
haste*. If you bother with your song window the overhaste is one of the
'call of ....' songs. As it also boosts spell damage it is a no brainer
for a song lineup. This coming from a 65 bard. Lower level overhaste
songs have vah shir in their name.
And in regard to pulling...it depends mostly upon the player not the
char. That aside the bard class provides fantastic pulling tools. And
no, I'm not biased. ;)

* No, general bard haste does NOT stack with any other spell haste. Only
overhaste does.
