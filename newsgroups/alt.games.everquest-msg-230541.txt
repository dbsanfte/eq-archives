Hi Splendid;

Again, last night it happened 3 times in BoT and had to camp. I was making
notes for another bug report and you were right.....everytime it happened I
was on my lizzy and was looting in a hurry (probably moving).

I can't wait till tonight to try your suggestion.

Thanks loads for your time and help.
