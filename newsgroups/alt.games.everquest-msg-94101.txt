When looking at just how bad our Class specific AA stuff is, I was
brainstorming some ideas, and came up with something similar.

Pet Mastery (<shrug> not too catchy, is it?  :)
1st level all pets that are summoned at the lowest step in the level range
are promoted to the second step
2nd level all pets that are summoned at the 2 lowest steps in the level 
range are promoted to the 3rd lowest.
3rd (top) level all pets are summoned at max level.

And we know the code to boost a pets level by one exists already, it's
what staves of Mastery do.

I haven't looked at the mage compendium board lately, but I'm sure this
generated quite a furor. :/
