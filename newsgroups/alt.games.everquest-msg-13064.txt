    I'd say sell it. It doesn't help you as a tank - in fact, the minus 100
HPs hurts you. You don't need the INT. Most, if not all of the places where
it could be used to modify faction have had that feature removed. And if you
sell the Amulet you could get a Cobalt Bracer with the cash from the sale -
and that has Shrink, which takes care of most of your size issues.
(Outdoors, Amulet helps and Bracer doesn't, but that is fairly rare.)
Really, for most characters this thing is a big toy - "Look at me, I'm a
skeleton with (insert weapon here)! Ain't it cool?"
