Suppose the MT switches to target 2 to get just a bit of agro and then 
switches back to target 1.  If some ranged dps happens to hit their assist 
hotkey at just that wrong moment then they will be hitting the wrong mob. 
Then shortly after the tank goes back to target 1 the second target goes 
running off to kill first the mistargetter and then anyone else standing 
close by.  You want your MA to *always* be on the target you want people 
focussing on.
