Someone must've broken into your house, stolen you PC, and replaced it
with an identical looking one, but with sub-standard equipment. They
copied over all the info from your hard disk and bios, as well as the
part numbers from your components. They then pulled out a large bag of
dust, dead skin, hair, and assorted other nasty stuff, and sprinkled it
inside your case, paying particular attention to your fans.

Or it could just be them adjusting the user-end problems for a
'minority' with the program each patch..

Patching is like a box of chocolates...
