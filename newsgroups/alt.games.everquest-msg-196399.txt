This is correct, I was doing too many jobs to keep pulling 3 and 4 mobs at a
time on a constant basis, I'd have had to sit down on occaision.  Of course
I didn't yet have Canni I.

On the other hand, the reason I was pulling was that it allowed me to MA
better, -anyone- could easily have accomplished the goal of getting mobs
into camp.  My cleric pulled quite often in the sub 60 levels, a question of
knowing the camps and having the will to keep grabbing mobs is all thats
required most of the time, and monks and rangers (who get the glory in hard
pull areas) were often quite willing to indulge me.

If I pulled, the mobs came at me, and as long as noone pissed them off, they
stayed on me well enough.  KEI wasn't so much the issue here as my
combination of high stamina (I put half my starting points into STA) high
level, high AC, and lots of +HP items, along with my natural troll regen and
ICC regen; I was far more able to sponge up damage than my fellow group
mates.

Without KEI, the pace at which I could pull should have declined.  Since I
knew I was leaving relatively soon, I experimented by keeping the high pull
rate up to see how  it would work out.  With breeze, I wasn't losing much,
with -nothing- it went a bit faster.

Its all for the sake of science, you know.
