Chris,

You will find some very helpful people in this group and a lot who have lost
their grip on reality (they must be a real treat in game as well).
I wish you well in your gaming EQ is a great game which I have played for 3
years now.
Disregard some of the gratuitous advice given with an appropriate answer in
this NG.. the majority of people in game are very nice.

regards

@ndrew
