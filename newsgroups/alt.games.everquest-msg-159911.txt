I believe NK guards are allied with Qeynos.  This being the case, you'll
want to hunt in BlackBurrow, which you can do from maybe level 5 (possibly
even earlier) through 10 or 12.  There are corrupt guards in West Karana,
and maybe in NK too, who will like you less and less, but who cares about
them?  They are mostly in out-of-the-way places.  At higher levels, they go
green anyway.
