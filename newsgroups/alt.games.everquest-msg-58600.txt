I Learned something about that directly.  2 things come into play.  1) No
equipment in EQ ever wears out.  2) You can have multiple players on 1
server.

In the long haul, most all players will have 60th level chars.  Any new
chars will have 60th level hand-me-down equipment.  Right now half the
players or more have 50th level or higher characters in the game.  This
explains why you find such high end equipment on lowbies.  Easy to get and,
because it never wears out, good forever.

The Lowbie style wars are already starting up now.  Look cool at 5th level.
Get your stats to 200 at 5th level.  Yada, yada, yada...  For those who play
the "honest" game, you read (even here) how "easy" it is to get your stats
to 200.  That is a croc without major twinking.
