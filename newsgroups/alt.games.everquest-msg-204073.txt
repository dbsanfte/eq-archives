I'm pretty new to FV and although I was aware of languages being a problem
and the TLC being in effect everywhere...There were some rules I wasn't
aware of, like Binds being melee location only.

So I hit 20 Yesterday and choose (or try to) choose a surname,
Sundancer...Rejected...Eh?
This is the surname of my Ranger on Bristlebane so why is it blocked here?
Anyway, I'll get a GM to sort that but I thought I'd check to see if there
is some naming rule where surnames are not allowed to be duplicated on here
or something.
What I found was nothing to do with names but confused me completely;

� Each character will be assigned an "alignment" upon creation. This
alignment will be described in brief on the character creation screen (in
the same location their Deity is described).

Erm...what? I saw no alignment option...Is this still in effect?

And;

� Languages will only improve 1 point each hour and will be capped at
level*5+5 skill points.

This can no longer be in effect...I had 100 in Human at about 5th level so I
assume this was dropped along with forcing the /roleplay tag on all
characters.
Anyone know what happened to alignment...did I just miss it?
