Id challenge you to prove that the price drop is because of the new stuff,
and not because of inherent problems with the system. I would say that if
kunark or velious had never ben released and we had *no* new stuff, that we
would still be seeing prices dropping (through oversupply). In other words,
new stuff is part of the reason, but the system is still inherently flawed.
