Actually, the whole idea was *not* to give a reason for Verant to nerf 
the nicer higher-end spells, which I understand (I hope I'm wrong) are 
restricted to 100k-plus mobs. A proportional damage spell would not need 
to be restricted in any way.

Besides, I'm typing this as I root and dot. Try that while you quad. =P
