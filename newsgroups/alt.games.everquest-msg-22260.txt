Another site (one of my favorites) is www.eqatlas.com/   It has a newbie
guide there, too.  If you are curious about learning an in-game trade skill,
check out www.eqtraders.com/

The book/manual that should have come with the game is quite innacurate in
numerous areas.  Verant simply says it is 'outdated' information, but some
of the info in there was never true to begin with.

You will find this game to be much more addicting than DII because of the
ability to interract with potentially 100's or 1,000's of different people.
And better graphics are forthcoming in the Shadows of Luclin expansion due
out late this year.

At first I thought the graphics were pretty sucky, too.  But after a while,
that became less of a problem.  The higher end gear and zones look better
than the beginning newbie gear and zones.

Also.... some versions of the game come with a Tutorial.  Look to see if
it's in your EQ files, and play that a couple of times to get used to the
controls.
