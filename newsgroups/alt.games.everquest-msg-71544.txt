>*  Soulbinders *
>
>A new group has appeared in Norrath (and on Luclin as well).  Rumor has it
>that these 'Soulbinders' have dedicated themselves to research on the power
>and essence of our inner being.  Some call them fanatics, as they claim that
>knowledge of the spirit that dwells within will lead them to an
>understanding of the whole of existence.  Citizens often treat them with the

>these Soulbinders  have dedicated themselves to public service, and for them
>that service falls along their lines of specialty...

>The next time you find yourself far away from home, you might seek the

>/ooc: We've added these "Soulbinder" NPCs to all cities that player

guess.
