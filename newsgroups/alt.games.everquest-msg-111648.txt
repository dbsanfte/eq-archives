On 3 occasions now i've seen newb rangers spawn in for the first time and
look around with that 'now what' look on there face. I walk over and ask if
they are new or alts, all 3 so far have been new. I then ask them to follow
me to the bank where i keep a spare bow (after a fletch skill session) and a
bunch of quite nice arrows. I give them the bow, quiver and arrows and any
armour i may of saved on my travels and explain fletching to them and buy
them some components to practice with.
Then its off to hunt! i buff them as best a lv31 ranger can and help them to
lv5 or so, then bid them farewell and ask them to keep in touch and let me
know how they are getting on. Every person i have helped so far has been
very gratefull and i enjoy hearing about there tales in the world of norrath
and when i pop over to see them 'in action' they offer me items/coin in
return (which i have little use for) and thats what i love about helping the
new players out, they tell me they have saved for days, or quested for this
item for me for my kindness off the bat.

I still get tells off these guys and its nice to see how they get on. The
only condition i ask is that when the equipment they have been given is no
longer any use, they should sit down and do the same to a newb that has just
started his life, then start the cycle all over again!

Phew..... Sorry if that was a little long but i just wanted to share this
with everyone.
