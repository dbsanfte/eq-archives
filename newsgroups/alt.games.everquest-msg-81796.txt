Batwings aren't really a big seller in my opinion. They are used for the
spell Levitate. Much like other spell components they are sold at various
cities by merchants so the market for them is small and depends largely on
luck and timing. If you really want to save something to sell to other
players, save items that are used for tailoring, smithing and other skills
if you find them.

Main skill to watch out for is Tailoring. Tailoring requires ALOT of animal
hides and spider silk (Not Spiderling silk) to get to high levels of skill.
Most people get bored real quick saving up the neccessary components to get
skill that high. Some things to look out for (not sure what level you are so
it might change as you level and your location as you travel.)

Some items to watch out for off the top of my head.

High Quality Bear Skins - (Drop of Kodiaks, bears, etc) will sell quickly
(On my server for 30-40pp per skin). They are used for 10 slot backpacks
with 10% weight reduction. save up a couple pelts if you can and you could
probably do a 2 or 3 hides for one backpack swap (2 pelts for one backpack)
backpacks are very handy when holding all the crap you can collect.
High Quality Cat Hides - sell well as they are needed for Quivers. Most
tailors I know need alot of these to work on their tailoring skills.
Spider silks - combine 2 spider silks (NOT Stacked) in a tailoring kit to
create one silk swatch. Stack of silk swatches should sell well as they are
required at virtually all levels of Tailoring

(Anyone know of anything else to keep an eye out for as time goes insert
here heh... I'm not a tailor by trade so I don't know what is In demand
other than these three things I hear of constantly)

Those are the main items that i know of that a newbie would have a chance of
hunting and collecting. HIGHLY suggest you read up on tailoring. It could
help you make your own armor. I know I am still wearing some of my own
tailored Raw Silk at level 44.

This is in my opinion the best way for you to get money at lower levels for
a couple reasons. Higher levels will pay good for stacks of tailoring items
that will save them from farming. if you get get a reputation and return
customers you can get good hookups (high level person has extra items that
he/she can give you for your services etc) at lower levels you can get exp
while collecting the silks, hides etc. Just my opinion hehe :)

Hope this helps as I know how hard it is being newbie and poor. Wish I had
known more about this kinda stuff when I was little :)
