Yeah that made a HUGE performance gain for me with my tnt 16 meg agp
card. The only problem was that it made the transparent areas on the
leaves on the trees a solid gray color so when I zoned into warsilks
wood I had much less lag but could not see in front of me at all
since, as you can imagine, there were big giant solid colored leaves
rather than before where you could see through parts of them. 

I guess it does work okay for a geforce though, I'd recommend it since
it really made even me zone no slower but was a large performance gain
( felt much less graphic lagged.. near trees or cities like Overthere
etc)
