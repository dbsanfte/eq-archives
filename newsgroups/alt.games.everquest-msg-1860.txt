I always either just sell to a vendor or hold particular research components
if I know a friend needs them.

No research component is worth much more than an NPC will pay for them
unless you run across someone who really really wants it.  I'll pay up to 5p
if that's the case, but that's very very rare.  The only one I can think of
that I paid 5p for is Page 26 (left side) because it's probably THE most
important enchanter spell and you get it at level 16.

Just give the research components to the people who need them.  Research is
a royal pain in the ass enough without having to beg someone for the
components.
