ROTFLMAO

When I had my amiga, and the ads for the first 1.2 gig HDD hit the 
computer shopper, I mentioned that I thought it was great and that if it 
hadn't cost $1,200 I would have gotten one.. The techs at my favorite 
computer store thought I was nuts, and they were further boggled that I 
actually bought the 500 meg HDD for it and I *wasn't* a programming 
geek. I just liked not having to flip discs around=)

Although, I still have a 250 meg HDD hanging around that has win3.11, 
netscape 1 and some virus program [norton IIRC] that i used as a rescue 
HDD in case of a virus problem so all I had to do was pop it in, move 
the regular one to slave and use the fresh HDD to clean up the infected 
one. I used to have a roommate that would click on anything...
