I've long since felt that the ranger needs an edge. Right now, there is no
point in playing a ranger. If you like the things a ranger stands for,
you're better of chosing a druid.

I've always looked at the druids port and gate spells with envy. A personal
port with a time restriction would be nice. It fits within the rangers
caracter to roam the world. Right now, traveling is not easier for a ranger
than for any other class, though it should.
Thinking about this, I've often wondered about adding two personal spells to
the rangers arsenal. A personal portbind spell. The ranger would have to
travel to a certain spot by conventional means, there he can cast his port
spot. From that moment on, his port spell will lead him there in an instant.
There can be only one port bind at a time, the first one dissappearing when
the second is cast. Note, I am taling about binding a port spot, not a spanw
spot. When the ranger dies, he would appear at his bind spot again. However,
he can travel to his corpse quickly since a smart ranger casts his port bind
near his hunting grounds. See it as being able to make camp anywhere and
live in the woods.

Then again, for some reason Verant thinks that changing the ranger for the
better will upset the class balance. I do wonder what is so damm good about
a ranger that he needs such penalties.
