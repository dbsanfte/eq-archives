I see only two ways for the game to know whether you're in
combat or not:  you're either in auto-attack mode or you're
on a mob's hate list.   I'd guess it's the latter.  That puts
quadding wizards and druids back where they were before,
for one thing, something I can see VI viewing as trivializing
advancement at higher levels.   As you point out, that does
put the pet classes at a big disadvantage, though, and does
the same for any caster in a group who's using the horse as
either a way around the spellbook problem or as insurance.

And, personally, I don't see a problem with it.   Use a horse
for insurance when things go wrong and you get the penalty
of not being able to med once you cast (or have your pet
attack.)   You might not die as often, but you'll probably have
to run more often (or just not kill as often.)   It's balancing
for the pure casters.   And hybrids will still need to take time
out from combat to med if they want mana just as the ones
w/o horses do.
