I'd agree EQ2's system "feels broke", especially at lower levels.
I've never really understood why they didn't skip the generic
steps.   It means they'd have to balance the classes back farther,
but that's not really much of an issue seeing how quickly people
level to 10.

Or class balance...

Then again, I'd argue EQ (and most likely every other game
of the ilk) already use the same system -- cleric/druid/shaman
are all healers, etc.    All EQ2 has done is a better job of
avoiding the pitfalls they jumped into in EQ.
