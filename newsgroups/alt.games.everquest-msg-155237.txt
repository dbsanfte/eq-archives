Just a question to those of you in the high end game.
Those of you that have successful well organized guilds.

On raids how do you avoid the ping pong effect of the
mob moving around during battle?

I am in a small up and coming guild and we are trying
to hone our raid techniques and tactics. Several raids
have gone less than perfect. Mainly I think due to not keeping
control of the mob.

Any insights?
