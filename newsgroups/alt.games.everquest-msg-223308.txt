Actually, the killer issue is not the number of items to collect, it's
the size/mob density of the dungeon.  The number of items seeded into
a dungeon is proportional to the number required to collect (1.5x).
The number of mobs in a dungeon ranges from ca. 90 to ca. 150.  If you
have a small collect in a large dungeon you are highly likely to be
screwed.

Yep, me too.

The mantra I've encountered most is "anything but a collect".  The only
failure I've had in my last 19 missions was a collect where we came up
one short despite killing 73 mobs (I've never seen a slaughter that
wasn't under 60).  Collects are stupid, there is no extra reward to
counter the extra risk.
