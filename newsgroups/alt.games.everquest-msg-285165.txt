On the move, we get TL's out of a dungeon raid from a guild wizard. 
Arriving with a shaman, I turn and ask for Billy... yeah, SOW would be 
fine too, I wasn't about to fight something, after all, but Spirit of 
Bih'Li is a recent addition to the spell lists on the Combine, and I'm 
excited about getting it instead of plain old SOW.

We take off running, but a couple zones later my Bobbing Corpse starts 
blinking.  I pause to refresh it, and boom, my SOW is gone.

Yep, he cast Spirit of Scale on me!

Yeah yeah, I know, its faster, and all we were doing was moving.

But a) it sure wasn't Billy.  As excited as I am about getting Billy 
over regular SOW, thats how dismayed I am about getting Scale instead of 
SOW.

b) when he casts it on himself, its no big, because he can refresh with 
regular SOW at the speed of insta click off his boots.

c) you could warn a guy!  Oh, yeah, I know, he said "just run", which if 
I'd been paying attention could have been taken to mean "just run, don't 
stop to cast spells or melee or anything or your SOW will drop"  But 
since I can't imagine circumstances in which I'd rather have Scale than 
ordinary SOW, I need a lot more warning than that.

Berg, 60 SK, who would rather fly at running speed than let his feet 
touch the ground at SOScale speed
