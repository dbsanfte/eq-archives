    Nope. I had a post of mine on The Safehouse deleted by the mods as being
a "clear exploit" when I explained how you can not only make "A Greedy
Beggar" into a level 47, backstabs for 168 monster, but could pass him off
to any person of your choice as their own personal pet. The level 60 BST in
our guild does that from time to time to help PL friends. If they made the
level buff not stack with Charm there would be no problems, mind you....
