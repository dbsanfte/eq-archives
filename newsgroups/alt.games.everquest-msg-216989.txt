After doing about 30 LDON adventures, I've found that the following
group can complete an adventure in about 45 minutes no problem.

4 tanks.  Paladins and SK's prefered.  At least 1 pally for pacify and
to pull.

1 rogue for disarm traps and backstab.

1 druid for buffing, chloroplast, snare for the few mobs that run,
atk/ac debuff, cast GH, and track named mobs.  A shaman might work as
well.

I find that the most important thing by far in LDON is DPS.  With 5
mele's mobs drop in 3 to 5 seconds and don't get a chance to do much
damage. When the 4 tanks ping-pong the mob, damage is spread around
and chloroplast provides adequate healing to keep everyone at full
health.  The paladin can single pull mobs and there are no respawns so
CC is not an issue.  If there is a bad pull, the druid can ghetto mez
and use GH if necessary.  With this config, I've never lost a mission,
had anyone die, or had the druid go OOM (the only time he even goes
under 50% is after a round of chloroplast or after a bad pull).

When I'm in a typical "balanced" group, time is a serious issue.  The
casters are always going OOM, the tank is always taking serious damage
thus requiring a cleric, and mobs take 15-20 seconds to kill.  I often
experience more deaths in these types of groups also wasting valuable
time.  

I know that this is not the proper way to group in EQ, but is more of
an "exploit" of some of LDoN's shortcommings.  I really wish SOE would
do something about this like mabye have missions with with fewer, but
tougher, mobs.  I know that there is the hard setting but on my server
the general consensus is that hard missions are impossible and no one
wants to do them (I've tried many times to talk groups in to doing one
but to no avail).

Just my 2cp... Flame on..
