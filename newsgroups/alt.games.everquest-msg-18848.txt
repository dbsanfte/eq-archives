i think i fall in the middle class

casters get a robe and and minor int/wis jewerly or hand-me-downs

i twinked my tanks fine steel plate (use them as demo models) subject to
sale upon which i make more

none of them have any weapons worth more than about 500pp

most plat i ever had at once was 2k, this is just starting to change now at
40, and mostly thru selling plate
1500pp undyed, 2k-3.5k depending on color if i dye it
