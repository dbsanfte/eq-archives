If I have 2 characters in Qeynos, do they both have to maintain a home?

Would I be able to just relinquish the room for 1 character, and have him 
put all his stuff (not alot, just his table and picture, and chandelier) in 
the other room, assuming I have given full access from my main character?

Is there any other benefit of maintaining two homes?  I can only leave one 
up as a trader, so I know that's not the reason.

For that matter, do I even have to maintain any type of home?  I rarely go 
there, except to check or sell in the bazaar.

Thanks
