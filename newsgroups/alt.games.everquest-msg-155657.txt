How often do I group?  As opposed to soloing?  Well, as a warrior, I am
grouped with at least one other person about 99.9% of the time.  Only at
level 60 have I soloed even a tiny bit.  When I do, it's an extremely slow,
painful process.

If your question is how often do I group in a full group, as opposed to a
smaller group...  I'd say maybe 40 or 50 percent of the time.

Theres maybe 10 or 12 players that I exp group with on any kind of a regular
basis.  The size of our group depends on who is online and wishes to go.  We
sometimes go as low as 2 (usually plus a bot if theres only 2 of us) or as
high as 6.    If we can't fill out the group, we'll usually hold the spot
for whichever of our friends might come on.  Sometimes random_guildmember_01
comes along.   Never do we just pick up a random LFG'er.  (I was about to
put "almost never", but I thought about it and realized that we really
don't.)  Speak of clicks and standoffishness all you want, but I play to
have fun with my friends.   We don't really feel the obligation to fill out
our group with someone that we don't really want to spend time around, just
because the game mechanics allow it, and it may or may not be slightly
better experience per hour.   Or just because they happen to wear the same
guildtag.

I like the people I play with.   They're smart, friendly and know how to get
the most out of thier characters.  We may not have the typical "perfect
group" often... or even a complete group often... but they're good enough
players that we make do with what we have, and go farther than most 6 person
groups including every member of the "holy trinity" would even attempt.

Most pickup groups that I've been in (or seen) tend to go for the full 6
people, but I have only rarely done pickup groups at anytime during my
history, and almost never now.    I guess that way theres more chance of
getting enough competent group members to carry the rest...


(sorry if that was somewhat rambling, it's late and I probably already
should have been in bed)
