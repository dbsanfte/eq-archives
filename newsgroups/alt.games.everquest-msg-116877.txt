At some point such a book would grow out of date, when zones are added
or rewamped (CT being a good example). Still, a small wonder no one
has published such a book yet.

However, the need for such a book (or even eqatlas.com) could be
eliminated by adding MapMaking as a tradeskill (and that will never
happen in EQ1). At lower skills you can draw simple maps of your
current location and near neighborhood, at higher skills very detailed
maps. Add paper types, pens and other map making tools and you have a
usefull(!) tradeskill. These maps could be traded between players of
cause.
