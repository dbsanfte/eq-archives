	Actually, this is completely untrue.

	According to Kendrick, Halflings got the 5% bonus ON PURPOSE.  During the
beta there were almost no Halflings, so the designers ramped up the race to
make it more appealing.  Their stats were even more grotesque than they are
now at one point -- Kendrick called their stats "Ogre level".  The stats got
rolled back somewhat before live, but the experience bonus stayed.
