    The thing is, though, we found out totally by accident. And it's not the
type of accident likely to be repeated. But you're right - cross-server talk
might spread it.

    Doesn't matter if someone opens the door or not. Repspawns will aggro on
people inside if they're even close to the door, and unless your MT is on
the back wall, he qualifies. You're also lucky that it was aneuks - we
always get Kyvs, and they usually tear through one or two healers before
being controlled.

    Ours was bugged too, sorta like what you described, but if you continue
the script it turns out to be a good thing. It's related to attempting the
script once, getting partway through, then withdrawing. The only bad part
about HP is the clearing to get to the event - the actual fight is sorta
fun, since there's a lot of fluidity to it. And best of all, every so often
you get charmed and kill a recruit or an officer!

    We've beaten it once. We're likely going to go back one more time, just
in case the officer with the key decides to go to WoW or something. I wish
we'd do it more, but a lot of people in the guild don't have the patience I
do.

    When they nerfed Aneuk loot, that pretty much made the zone a crapfest.
There`s three events (dog, the guy in the amphitheatre, the crazy flurry
guy) we don`t even attempt because regardless of what they drop, it couldn`t
possibly be worth the hassle. That speaks volumes.
