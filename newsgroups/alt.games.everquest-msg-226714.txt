....with collections?


With my 39 bard we did a collection and failed with 1 more to collect. That
is  not unusual....but we did not get another drop for the next 30 min, so
zero points. It didnt help that our main tank died and was unable to zone
back in for some reason, but we still managed to kill another 10 or so with
me tanking and not one drop. It was infuriating!!

This happening to anyone else?
