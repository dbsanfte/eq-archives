It's not so much that I'm extremely fond of soloing. It's that I live
in Australia and much of the rest of Cazic Thule is on US or Euro time.
So on weekdays much of the rest of the population of the server is doing
other stuff when I'm playing.

And yes, clerics can solo... Dark blue undead generally use about half
my mana to nuke into bone chips. With occasional exceptions; my first
encounter with the wraithbone champion in DL (last night) used 97% of
my mana...

Soloing also means I'm free for rez requests, from guildies and others.

Anyway, thanks for the tip. :-)
