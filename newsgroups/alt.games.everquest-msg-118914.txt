When both hands are ready at the same time (ie. an open attack immediately
following the hitting of auto-attack button), the off hand weapon is processed
first. The primary hand is process second. The time stamps for both are the same
but the log entry for secondary succesful swing occurs prior to the primary log
entry. Animation follows the same tendency. But for all intents and purposes,
both weapons swing at the same time as seen with the time stamp in the logs
being the same.
