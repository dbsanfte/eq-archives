It's sad when High level players do that, I walked past the PoD in Rivervale
a few days ago, he was in FULL fine steel (dyed blue) with 2 Yaks, why would
people destroy that stuff? I know it's not Uber compared to a lot of the
gear out there but it's still damn nice stuff for a level 10-20 player,
maybe even 10-30 or 10-40 if they're needy enough.

Some high level players disgust me sometimes, glad I don't do that to
newbies
