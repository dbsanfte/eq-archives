Hmm, at 14...look for some more +WIS items.  You should be able to get some
+WIS earrings and possibly some gloves (Splitpaw less than 100pp?).

Really you're at that sweet spot where you don't really have to set a HUGE
chunk aside for spells yet and you're just starting to get some of the
*real* druid spells.  You'll soon be in the stage of your advancement where
your melee weapon won't be as much of a concern either - unless it is WIS
enhanced anyway.

I'd say just keep doing what your doing and use that 100pp to add some
smaller, cheaper, wis items to your loadout.
