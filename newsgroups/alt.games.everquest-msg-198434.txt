    Shared coin space doesn't bother me so much. I mostly use coin to buy
items that could easily be ferried back and forth with the shared bank
space. If I were raising tradeskills through the 100's I could see it being
a hassle, though.

    Depends on how you measure "better". Could have made better characters
on the same "points budget"? Yes, of course. Could have made characters that
were more like what an untwinked primary is like at that level? Other than
the paladin, who had some amazingly bad choices, I have yet to see a profile
that was much different than the ones we see here asking for gear advice.
