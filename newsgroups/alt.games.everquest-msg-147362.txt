Your a luck guy bro, and god bless your mom.
But now think how I feel, I knew 2 men that died saving others.
How would you like it if your mom had been on that plane and you come

move on, it happen boo hoo.
Yeah, I guess it would matter then.

All I'm saying is it wouldn't have hurt anyone to put a little
