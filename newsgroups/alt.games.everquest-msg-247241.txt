The issue i have is that while you make them =.. they are referring to
different things... a cartoon is a show... yet you refer to a
character as a toon. So how does toon = cartoon when they are meant to
refer to completely different things.. yet mean the same?

This i can go with on the = part since the 'toon' in question you are
refering to is the show. But how do you refer to a character inside
the show also as a 'toon' and have it make any other sense than a
wink, wink, nudge, nudge d00d type way. Sure.. its cool.. but it
doesn't really fit
