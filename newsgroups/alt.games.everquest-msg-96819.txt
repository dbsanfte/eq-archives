Perhaps, but the ones most deadset against those changes (Brad, etc)
probably wouldn't have made the changes even if it meant driving EQ
under totally, I'm sure. The majority of the changes were something
that most of us would have liked, even if they were only minor
annoyances. The statement from VI was right, I think, the hell levels,
etc served only to annoy.

As for "all classes for all races", I don't see that coming. Gnome
paladins/SKs and Halfling paladins/rangers seemed logical, given that
the base classes of each of those hybrids were open to those races.
There was no real reason not to make them available.

Of course, I still wanna see troll/ogre necromancers, even if their
int does suck for it. ;-) And kitty monks...
