Monk... FD is the reason a guy with no armour can survive past 20 ;o)

SK... pets to hide behind, FD later on, nice spells

Pally... good stun/heals... long downtime

Ranger... can solo animals... but not as durable as SK or Pally... SoW
instead of feign means you'll be running away.

Rogue/Warrior/Bard... difficult if you're not going to spend a lot of time
focussing on them.

My recommendation... for a casual Alt you don't have to worry about... go
with the Monk (or maybe a regen-race SK... Ikkies rulz!) ;o)
