Lots of good recommendations... Just one word of warning...

With AMD Athlons and the KT266A MBs...  You will notice some hits in
performance, so don't be discouraged if you get say, an AMD1700XP (Like I
do) and notice some problems or notice it isn't going as smoothly as you
would hope it would.  The Coding of the game is geared more towards P4 Gig
chips and better, which means the AMD has to work harder on some aspects.
You will need to modify the eqclient.ini file just a little, like
UseUmbra=FALSE and not use the higher level textures for the time being.
With 512 Meg of Ram, you should be ok.  Be sure you also have the 4 in 1
drivers if using a VIA KT266A MB that will resolve some other issues.

I have a AMD Athlon 1700XP with 512meg 2100 DDR, GeForce 3, SB Audigy,
Intel 100 ProB ethernet card and there are some minor hiccups, but all in
all, I can play without much of a problem.
