Going LD counts as zoning as far as poison is concerned.  It will wipe the
dagger clean.

Recently, it's been found that it's not even that cut-and-dried as being
"primary weapon slot".  If you have a throwable Piercing (not a throwing,
stackable weapon) in your range slot, apply poison, and throw the Piercer,
you can proc your poison from a limited distance.  Usually 30-50'.   So, it
seems to be more of a matter of applying it to your "first main/range weapon
attack"

Walrus Tooth is still a valid piercer and would still proc the poison.
Switch to a blunt weapon would hold off the proc (not sure if I remember
right, but there still may be a poison or two that will work without a
piercer).
