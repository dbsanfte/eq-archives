I did FG side. I used to hunt The Shissar thing in there with the help 
of the gaurds.

Might as well just swarm kite then though. :) 

At any rate the no-jboots thing should be fairly short term. I'd be 
focussed on either getting a pair of jboots or tboots asap. I can raise 
a few hundred pp a night without really trying at 25-30th level just 
selling stuff to the venders. TBoots would only a take a couple weeks of 
leisurely farming. You'd just have to switch priorities from xp to cash.
