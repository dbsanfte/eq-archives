How does this help?  If this issue is that low levels can buy better stuff
than they can loot, that doesn't change unless they can no longer buy it.

Gear deterioration increases the price, but doesn't remove the problem.  You
can still buy stuff every week or whatever that's better than you loot.  Only
making items nodrop or putting level limits on them actually keeps twinkies
from being better equipped than folks who loot stuff.  Even nodrop doesn't
completely stop it, if low levels are allowed to loot stuff that others kill.

Level limits on items, however, completely takes this away.  Level
"recommendations" would be fine too, IF the penalties were such that the item
was worse than level-appropriate gear, but that's not the case in EQ.

If you're worried about mudflation within the top levels (i.e. droppable gear
from endgame zones on more casual characters at the level cap), AA limits,
flag limits, or whatnot would be required.
