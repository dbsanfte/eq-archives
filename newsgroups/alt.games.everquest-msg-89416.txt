 Nope. Bracers are my weak area. The Tynnonium was an upgrade. Being on
giant faction that leaves out BoB (unless it can be sneak quested which
I think they nerfed). We have started killing Tormax though so hopefully
a Tormax bracer is in the near future. Three kills and no bracer yet. If
I do get better than the Shackle I would probably finish the WF quest.
Who knows, it may end up with a quest to upgrade it further down the
line.

 I guess. I remember doing the previous shackle quests... It's a painful
memory. Spent many many hours in Kurns to get the bone I needed. Had to
end up buying it since it would never drop. Then there's the fun Kwinn
search. Oh and who could forget the intact brutling choppers... So
unless they upped the rate on certain items, you'd have to be pretty
lucky to get everything in one day. Overall I suppose you would probably
get up to Steel faster than someone could get up to the point of needing
Raster.

 I'm curious if the turn-in for epic would take the WF at this time. I
know I wouldn't want to be the first monk to try that. I'm sure it's
supposed to work but knowing Verant they may have forgot to add that
part (like they did some of the Tynnonium tome components).

 Overall it's a good quest. The only inconsistency I see so far is that
Veltar is in Droga (as the slave) and also in Dreadlands as himself.
