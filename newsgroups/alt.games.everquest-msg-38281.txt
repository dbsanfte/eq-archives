Sure I wasn't afraid of dying, but that is not the point.  The point is that
if VI wants to prevent high-levels from fighting low level mobs they should
also prevent low level mobs from attacking high level characters.  It is
stupid to the point of *harassment* that they program low-level mobs that
they presumably do not want us fighting to be attacking us.
