Depending on the raid leader, likely not a problem. Particularly if you
ask ahead of time and state that you're not expecting any loot, just
faction. I'm the raid leader for my guild, and I constantly have extra
faction hunters coming along. They usually ask politely and state up
front that they aren't going to be rolling on any loot that may drop. So
I figure, what the fuck? Some extra damage never hurts, so I let them
come along.

If you get into a lower level raid that's only doing the front edge of
the arena, you may have to go on several to get decent faction. If you
can get a larger raid and get in a shot on three PoZ, I believe you'll
be up past indifferent to amiable or so already. Two PoZ raids and you
should be ally.
