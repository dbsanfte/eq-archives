No this only affected hybrids AFAIK; they changed /discs like
Weaponshield to spells so spell AAs were extending it which they have
since fixed.  I haven't checked recently but last time I tried I
couldn't WS while sitting while I could before as the game now sees it
as a spell.. gah.

Entrap now doesn't work with extended range items which a lot of
Rangers aren't happy about (causes less aggro now which is also bad
news but this might get changed).  One step forward, two point seven
five back.
