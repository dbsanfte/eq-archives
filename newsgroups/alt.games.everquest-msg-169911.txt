"No banes = no emp loot for you" would be a fast way of changing that...

Seriously though, if emp is a guild priority (which obviously it is) then
melees shouldn't be slacking and picking their asses when it comes to making
banes.  Its not fun.. it takes a long ass time... I know, I have dual baned
ulaks, but its just one of those things you have to do..

We knew about the proc before our first encounter.. basically everybody knew
xxx and yyy, which we added together to get a sketchy guide, but in reality
everything we knew was quickly thrown aside and we just did it our own way.
What problems did you guys have with it?

You blew it in the same way cursed is blown.. whether delayed or totally
blown, its still griefing if done deliberatly.
Killing 1 taskmaster every hour is griefing.. sure it doesn't totally blow
the cursed spawn, merely delays it.. its still screwing a guild over though
who is ready to engage.

Im not saying "bend over" to your local uber guild... but sometimes you have
to assess if its worth the shit or not, for some ok loot (its decent, not
risk v reward), knowing your blowing a mob spawn for a significant period of
time, and pissing off your main rivals..

I don't buy that.   Sure it makes a good argument to defend killing Blood,
but i think in reality your leaders did it to stick 2 fingers up at CiH

In our last dispute involving a GM, the other guild was the only ones to use
public channels in an abusive manner(well unless you include my "oh grow up"
in ooc) and the GM sided with them.. =/

My point is, if the mob is contested.. you killing blood and TLing out
(which spawns Emp, and makes him poof) means you HAD your chance!  Whether
you attemped Emp or not, you spawned him, you didn't kill him...  you had
your chance, step aside and let the contesting guild get the next shot at
him.

Sure, if hes honestly done "for the loot" and not to say "fuck you" to CiH
and make them wait 4 hours for the next repop.
Killing TM's is legitimate.. they drop the pouch needed for an emp key.. but
you can also kill Tms in an act of griefing to deny access to the Cursed
cycle.

Well if it continues, you can always whine to me.  Cuz i know the feeling
all too well :)

I don't see what happened that made Gylphed yours WITHOUT doubt?
Gylphed is popped when 2 named mobs die.. you killed 1 rhoz, they killed the
other..  I see it both guilds had a claim to the mob, whoever the GM sided
with, the other guild would be dissapointed.. but to claim it was your
triggered mob?   I don't think so

I should get a twink tagged in a rival guild, then next time they compete
with my guild for a mob, I'll log him on and spew insults in shout or
something :)

I dunno.. maybe they are just a lawless disrespectful guild?  I kinda doubt
it tho.. controlling a set of people is one of the first steps in reaching
the top, so its unlikely thats the reason.

Maybe they just don't want the headache of racing every pop, or maybe you
guys have a bigger force online earlier? (Cuz when you have killed Emp a few
times, you can half the # of required ppl for each kill)

Oh I don't disagree that they did a bad thing.. but Im sure a lot of the
community called it such, they did on Prexus and every other server

Btw to correct you - ST always had primal.  Before the sleeper was woken,
after the sleeper was woken, primal never stopped dropping.

The recent ST revamp actually REMOVED primal (albeit replaced with
prismatic - identical), but it did add other class loot, and added a lot
more named mobs

You will find many ME flames and whines from me in this NG in recent times !
Seru doesnt really take that much work though, and hes a badass mob to see,
plus some very rewarding loot.

Don't worry too much about what I say, im a natural born flamer/instigator !
