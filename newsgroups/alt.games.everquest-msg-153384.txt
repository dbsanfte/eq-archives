First, anyone rooting for any reason other than crowd
control in a group with two melees is just wasting mana.
Root can break every time the mob is hit.

Second, I'd never get XP on my wizard against reds if I
didn't "root bomb," since he's the only one in the group. ;)
As long as you cast snare on them too, and make sure it
sticks before doing damage, it's fairly safe.
