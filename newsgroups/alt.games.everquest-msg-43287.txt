Feel free. It is a free country.

Of course, all those packets are still hitting your PC. They're all beiong 
interpreted by your TCP/IP stack. They're still being interpreted and 
analysed by your machine.

All you've really done is added another level of interpretive software to 
your stack. Your processor still processes every packet, and it still eats 
memory. If that's what you want, have fun. 

Otherwise, block that crap off at your router. I don't know if the @home 
equipment has that functionality, but it very well may.
