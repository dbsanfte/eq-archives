Don't forget to use your snare.  It is always good to get it snared
before you try to root it... that way, when root breaks (and it will),
you'll have time to get up and root/snare it again.  If it can be
rooted, it can be snared.  Take heed of the things that can't be
snared or rooted.  Then FD is your friend.
