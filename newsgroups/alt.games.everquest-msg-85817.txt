While I agree with your opinion that it's an exploit, I don't think it's
"serious."

I'm not going to debate it though, we went around on this lately and plenty
of people think that MQ is somehow in the "Vision" and I'm not likely to
change their minds, and they aren't likely to change mine, since neither
side provided Verant quotes regarding it.

Another reason I'm not going to debate it is because I do it on occasion. :)
