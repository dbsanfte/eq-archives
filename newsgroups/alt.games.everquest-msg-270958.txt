Yes there are people of max level already. A dozen hours of mad leveling is 
off by 2 orders of magnitude. You are probably looking at ~250 hours for max 
level.

> If the game is so easy, how can farming/powerlevelling matter?

The game is much easier to just level in. This is a fundamental diffrence in 
approach though . Eq always required grouping for experience, wow does not. 
Wow regeneration rates are measured in seconds instead of hours like old eq 
was. ( this is literal, eq at one time took an hour to regenerate to full 
for a warrior, Wow takes eating for 10 seconds). AS a fun aside debuffers in 
wow just suck ass . 10 minutes of a debuff seems to last forever and are 
really nasty to boot.

Power leveling is not an issue . Farming is an issue. Equipment for some 
classes in wow is just as critical as it was in eq and almost as rare. This 
is probably where they expect people to spend much of the end game.
