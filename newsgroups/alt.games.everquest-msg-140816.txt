Once I get them up to level 22 or so, I stop playing them for different
reasons varying from each character. On my 22 Cleric because the experience
dragged to a grinding halt. On my level 23 Necromancer, because he got raped
by Slate and I was unable to make level 24 again. On my level 22 Rogue,
because... I don't know, I just sorta dropped 'er and made a new character.
On my level 22 Beastlord because I wanted to take up a Monk and get in on
their ability to tank semi-well and do damage almost comparable to a Rogue
(which turned out as a failure, I really dislike the Monk class). All of my
other characters that are in their teens and 1-9's because I was unable to
get a group, soloing did not work well, or I wanted to try a new class that
seemed to be outperforming me.
Just writing this out I am beginning to see a trend...
