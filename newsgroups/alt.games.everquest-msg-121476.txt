It depends.  Burning Woods before 54, Ice Comet is probably the best way to
go.  Draught of Fire is damned near useless there.  But yeah, Draught of
Fire is the better choice anywhere else I can think of.  Maybe IC is better
in the Sol dungeons as well.  But 95% of the time, I'd have the draught on
spell jewel #1.
