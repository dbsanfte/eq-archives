75 is plenty of agil, as far as AC, from level 1 - 60. 74 agil on an
int caster, at level 60, and if he puts on an item with just ONE agil
he gains 40 ac ( a guy in my guild was in this situation. ) Beyond
that one additional point from 74 to 75, he is not going to gain much
ac at all even if he added 20 more.

I'm not sure exactly what you mean by that, or how someone could say
it was a "stat" anyway.

I remember Verant saying something similar or some players coming 
to that conclusion, armor ac affects damage absorbtion. A level 60
master tank warrior with 1400 ac or whatever is still going to get hit
like an old lady bitch on a raid, he is just going to be able to get
hit like one a hell of a lot more times than a ranger or my druid.
