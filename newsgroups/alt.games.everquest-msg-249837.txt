We'll have to agree to disagree on this one. There are some classes that
simply cant be replaced. Warrior where defensive is required, Clerics where
a cheal chain is requried, and chanters where non-rootable crowd control is
required.

People keep saying that druids bring so many unique abilities to the table.
I dont see it. Aside from Fire/Cold Resists, Ive yet to see a single ability
that isnt duplicated in another class, and better. This however is how it
SHOULD be. Druids are generalists, and as such are one of the premier
soloing classes.

That being said.....

I have personally been the main healer for NToV, and Tier1 planes raids as
my druid. I didnt LIKE it ( Id rather be playing my warrior there :P ), but
it CAN be done.  Fact is though that EVERYONE on the raid would have been a
hell of a lot happier had we has a cleric around to be the primary healer.

You say that Druids are hard to replace.. .I ask you here and now, What
abilities does a Druid bring to a raid that another class cant do better,
aside from the Resists issue ? Ill concede that point to you :)

Now, if you want to claim that a Druid is able to pinch hit in a lot of
diferent roles, thereby filling any holes the raid may have, then Ill
happily agree. I never claimed otherwise. My only contention is that they
dont have any absolutely necessary roles to fill, IF there are plenty of the
other classes around. Its like in baseball. A good utility infielder is a
helluva a valuable asset if you have the luxury of being able to keep one on
the payroll, but strictly speaking its not a REQUIRED position.
