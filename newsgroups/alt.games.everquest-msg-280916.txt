This "better for lunch money in the bazaar" thing is precisely what the 
Epic Dawn guild is designed to counteract; with all members sworn not to 
buy anything in the bazaar or off vendors (other than things the vendor 
always has in stock), no twinking, no running around in high level zones 
looting dead bodies, but rather earning your own way, something funny 
happens; loot you'd turn your nose up at, quest rewards you'd never 
bother with, become very welcome indeed.

Its a good feeling to go to GD and kill some drakkal wolves with great 
difficulty, and when one drops a Black Steel Wrap, to be excited about 
the upgrade.

On the other hand, I have to admit its also fun to take a few hundred pp 
to the bazaar and come out with amazing bargains that would allow you to 
solo that drakkal wolf five or ten levels before I could... the ED 
approach certainly isn't the only valid way to play.
