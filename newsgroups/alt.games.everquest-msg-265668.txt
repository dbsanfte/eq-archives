True, at level 20 once you've completed your subclass quest you will 
automatically become whatever subclass is the next evolution for your class 
depending on your alignment. However, you can at level 17 take on the 
Betrayal Quest and change your city alignment. I'm not familiar enough with 
this system to know whether this means that you can keep your evil alignment 
while becoming a citizen of Qeynos, for example (and thus becoming an evil 
Wizard), or how exactly it changes things. Someone else with more info on 
this will have to respond. But you're correct in your assumption that unless 
you proactively do something, your character creation time choice of good or 
evil, will determine which of the two final subclasses your class evolves to 
become.
