I can't tell you how many times the Prism /get has included 'Everyone 
PLEASE obtain an EB item!'  To no avail, alas. :)

As far as I'm concerned, with the exception of irrelevant details like 
say, flags, and possibly gear, you guys -are- up to speed with us.  I 
dunno how our officers talked you guys into this 'but we get all the good 
loot!' deal.  But hey, I'm certainly not going to -complain-... :)

It just seems like there may be a good deal of umm... ego? sense of 
self-importance? on our guild's part.  And that might go to explaining our 
choice of tactics there.

>Now if only we can get those damn BL pets settled down 

Ahh, the patented Prism Push(tm). :)  The funny part is, after the 
occasinal raid, Certain Unnamed People like to blame the fact the mob is 
bouncing all over creation on the fact the enchanters are nuking with 
Insanity, which has a horrendous knockback, and could we please use one of 
our nukes that doesn't have a knockback...

So naturally, this annoyed me, and when I get annoyed, I design 
experiments.  So I duelled a very patient rogue bot, and cast pretty much 
my whole spellbook at her 10 times, to figure out what had knockback, what 
didn't, and exactly how much.  Exactly how much turns out to be the hard 
part, since apparently knockback isn't implemented as 'move the target x 
units', but as  'accelerate the target by x amount', and this leads to 
highly variable results, so my sample size of 10 may be a bit small.

Suffice it to say, all enchanter nukes above about level 29 Have a 
knockback component.  And the knockback component is about equal to the 
knockback of 10-15 normal melee hits or about half as many normal pet 
hits, or kicks.  Once you factor in that we can only fire off that nuke 
once every 8 seconds, we push a lot less than, say, a hasted dual-weilding 
melee or a pet, not even counting any procs those other push-happy fools 
might have.

/rant off. Sorry. :)

>and make sure everyone has /assist OFF!

I haven't noticed much problem with that.  The real challenge is getting 
them to -use- assist in the first place. :)

>Too funny, I havent posted on RGE in well over 2 years and I happen to

Heh, we're AGE over here, far too rebellious for the rec.games heirarchy. 
:) Aye, at the time I posted, I was thinking 'hmm... what if someone from 
VC reads this?  Heck, what if someone else from Prism reads this?'  And 
fancy it being you...

Unknown Kadath, the Dreamquester, ah, ye who chummed around with Al'Kabor 
at the opening of the grand spires, and Norrath's invasion of Luclin, and 
forever after bearer of the 'of the Nexus' title (mild envy).  But I'll 
let you tell that tale, or the bards of Google sing it.

And yet, he who fills a similar role in VC, as I do in Prism.  Both of our 
guilds are of the belief that it shall be a Good Loot Raid on the sole 
condition that we die, at least once, and preferably painfully. :)

Concussion, man, it's a fun quest. :)
