Was flipping through the channels Saturday night (taking a break from gaming
for a night) and came across 'Cowboy Bebop' on Adult Swim on Cartoon
Network.  I'm not really in to anime, but it caught my eye.  Before I
realized it, I'd watched the entire episode.  What a great show.

Anyone else out there enjoy Cowboy Bebop?
