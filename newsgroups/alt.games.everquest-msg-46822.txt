    Perhaps they're testing what the environment will be like after everyone
uses the mail quests and similar quests to level up, as opposed to trying to
hit the one free bat in all of GFay. Oh, wait - they didn't give you any
cash. Never mind.

>They should've just wiped the server and gone live, or left it alone.

    Go live? Right now, people are talking about how lonely it is being
unable to communicate with other races, and how it's a soloist's paradise.
That is NOT something to take live. Hmm - maybe folks were bumped to level
24 to see if folks WOULD learn languages to Excellent given the cap room to
do so. Of course, all you'll hear with your new language skills will be
variants of "Yeah, I'm screwed, too" and "Damn VI!".

>Response is "I am now level 24, can't fight anything that will give me
>loot or money,

    That's not quite true. You can fight whatever you were fighting before.
You just can't level off them, or gain any ability points (except in casting
skills). Casters will have the advantage here - get some cash off mobs you
can still kill, buy bigger spells, and get going on XP again. Melees....
well, casters will have the advantage here.

    This is also a good "test under fire" of that loot code. One person
mentioned not being able to obtain a GLS - it'll be interesting to see what
quests fall out as being the big money-makers in these circumstances. Then,
once you players identify the quests in the hopes of getting out of this
hole they've put you in, VI will nerf the quests before the server goes live
since they're CLEARLY "unbalanced". The quests that have TLC-related issues
should also be revealed in the next few days, and hopefully they'll be fixed
too.

>So much for this server until Monday."
>What the fuck were these morons snorting this morning?

    I think they're trying to test some of the things listed above. The only
problem is players on FV want to have fun NOW, and not help VI determine how
to bite them in the ass at a later date.
