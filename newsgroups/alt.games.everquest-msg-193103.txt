I just started playing EQ a few weeks ago, but I have taken my first
character (a shaman) to level 26 with very little PL.  I have noticed
that groups tend to think of a shaman as a healer with buffs.  Since I
am taking down mammoths solo without losing a bubble of HP and only 2
bubbles of mana, I disagree with the role of the shaman in most
groups.  

If I am the only healer type I don't nuke as much, but if there are
several healer types I nuke away.  While in PC my DD and DoT spells
would account for a signigicant part of the total damage.  In MOST
cases I had to fight the tanks to get any loot.  In the bandit camps I
left several groups after the looting issue was not resolved.  I was
amazed at how many groups didn't have a looting policy, or they had a
policy of "You kill it, you keep it".  Of course, when I started
waiting until a critter had less HP than one nuke spell and then
killing it they got mad and looted anyway.  That happened on two
successive nights in PC in two different groups.  Needless to say I am
very picky about what groups I join with now.

A very annoying thing happened in BB when I was trying to find a
ruined gnoll chain coat for a new ranger character of mine.  I joined
with two other players and said "I don't want any loot, but I need the
coat for a quest".  The tank of the group never responded.  After I
snared and helped kill a gnoll I went to pull another gnoll and left
the tank and healer to loot.  He looted the coat.  He would never
respond to my questions about the coat.  I even offered to buy it
(even though I had not looted anything but gnoll fangs that he left),
but no response.  He left and I didn't get the coat.  On the brighter
side of things the very next evening I joined with another group and
made the same statement.  To my surprise the group leader gave me a
coat that he had looted before I got there.  So, there are some
players that aren't selfish looters.

Overall the looting issue (and ignoring the "out of mana" msg) are my
main complaints about the game and players.  I am having a blast.
Finally, discovered the joy of bazaar and I actually have _some_ money
now.
