I think SOE must've gotten the default permissions screwed up.
All my characters started out with full permissions to the public,
but only the character profile itself visible to guild members.
Seems backwards to me!

This does certainly take voyeurism to a new level.  I picked some
random bazaar merchant and browsed his bank...

Some of the other data also appears broken.  E.g., the "last logged
in" info seems to bottom out at November 16, at least in the guild
views.  I do like the idea of being able to see who's in a guild.
Of course, one person's "like the idea" is another's "invasion of
privacy".  /shrug
