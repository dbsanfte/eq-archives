  As I recall in the Warrens there is the "Water Source". Its well, the
water near where the Prince spawns. If you look in the water you just see
this floating name that you can target.
  A friend of mine told me that it doesn't attack back and that you can't
kill it. I've seen Kobolds attacking it to no avail, they just swim for
hours hitting it.
  I'm not sure if it's a bug or what but it's a thought. Downside is that
the Kobolds must likely will come after you and kill you while your AFK...
if you don't drown first.
