Learn to snip please, I mean, your comment is pointless enough without
having to leave in everything else.

On a serious note you only posted this to have a pop at Ben.

I read the other thread to which this relates, am non-plussed about it, but
the fact is, Ben insulted you for a reason, your post here is just some sad
revenge insult that serves no purpose (your basically said /agree + you suck
ben!, ie, pointless).

Am not defending ben because I have known him years (I havent) or know him
well (I dont), just pointless posts like yours irratate me, so I make
pointless posts of my own to point out this fact :) (ahh the joys of public
forums).
