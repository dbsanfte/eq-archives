My list describes what happens to Non PLed chanters, and was based on 
personal experience.  PL the character and I'm willing to assume all 
skills stay at zero, for the sake of arguement.  Play it up naturally, 
though, and Alteration goes up just fine.  Its the OTHER skills that 
won't go up.

Since the other skills (except Evocation) are actually also vital ones 
for an enchanter, its going to be necessary to blow training points on 
them and/or to sit somewhere safe and chain cast them.  POK is one place 
for that, oddly enough if you are being PLed you can do it then, too, 
its not as though you'll be doing anything useful with the mana after all!

The skills that suffer from PLing are not the casting ones, they are 
defense (easily remedied by using porcupine PLing method) and 
offense/melee (Oh come on, while my cleric and shaman might argue that 
these are useful skills, even I am not going to pretend they are useful 
for a chanter over the age of 20)

Silly you indeed, since you are talking about what happens when you PL 
while I'm talking about what happens when you don't.  But if you -are- 
PLing, there's no need to stop, as I suggest above, spend your time 
chain casting the first level spells each time you level -while- you are 
being PLed!  What were you planning on doing with that mana, just 
standing there FM?  Casting Nukes or something?  Oh I know, you figured 
they were going to have her PB AE stun the mobs to extend the amount of 
time it would take the mobs to kill themselves on the DS.

Mez is pretty useless until 20+.  Tash even more useless, probably until 
24+, unless you are grouping with higher level friends.  Slow, well, now 
you are starting to interest me.  Haste, though, come on, how much 
tactical skill does it take to learn to haste the melee's?  I could 
explain that to you in three words, if you were a complete newbie I'd 
have to take a paragraph to point out who the melee's are.  Haste them, 
keep them hasted at all times.  This isn't brain surgery.

Slow, as I say, there's a case for that being a learning exercise as a 
chanter.  As a shaman, see Haste above; slow every stinking mob.  You've 
nothing more important to do, it will save  you healing mana (and your 
heals suck anyway), and its not like there's a shortage of mana when 
you're a shaman over 24.  Plus when you get aggro, heck, you're a 
shaman, suck it up!  Chanters on the other hand are perineally short on 
mana and might at any given moment actually need the stuff to do their 
real job, CC.  Plus getting aggro as a chanter means taking a serious 
beating, pumping out stuns to keep from getting wasted and hoping 
something gets that mob under wraps fast, and unless you've grouped with 
a healer, a long painful recovery from the disaster.

What to slow, when to slow, when its better -not- to slow, and why... 
these questions can be key ones for a chanter who isn't grouped with a 
shaman.  SO PL her up to 12, then let her play till she hits 13.  Back 
to the PLing.

You don't mention a couple of the more amusing spells; PB AE stuns and 
the Whirl line.  These come early on and -are- useful from the second 
you get them; sadly Whirl line decreases in usefulness, although its 
still handy for stopping runners

PLing to whatever level your friends are at, so you can play with them, 
instead of being 20 levels lower than them and relying on soloing or 
random pickup groups... that doesn't seem like a bad plan.

I hate to see it happen to that rare and valuable resource, the genuine 
newbie... but if I had a RL friend on some other server than mine ask me 
to join him there, I'd certainly hope he'd PL me up to exp group level 
with his character rather than leave me to flounder and try to catch up 
on my own, untwinked, un PLed, and with fewer friends than I have on 
Morel-Thule.

Better plan, as you suggest, would be to make alts and play some at the 
lowest levels (1 to 10 is the serious training wheels portion of the 
game now, you really -can't- screw up!), then go on to PL to the next 
spell level, play there some, PL to the next spell level, play there 
some, repeat until you get to the desired level.  But that requires a 
lot more from your friends than just spending a day getting you straight 
up to 24ish and teaching you the ropes by telling you about it instead 
of letting you learn on your own.  By 30 I bet that 24 PL'd character 
will be no more useless than 90% of the "real" 30s you meet... I've been 
playing with those people quite a bit recently, having run a shaman to 
51 and now a chanter to 30, and honestly 70% of them are more clueless 
than anyone I remember playing with at those levels back in the day.
