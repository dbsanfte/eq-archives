Okay given that http://home.comcast.net/~cjstjohn/maps/PoM_named.gif
is the right map.

I've been into the forest and up on to the battlements (only to pull
from there not to stay).  There was no obvious way in but as I said I
didn't stay up there long.  Where on that map would is the way in?
(luckily it has loads of annotations which might help someone to point
the entrance out!)

I guess another question is whether much of this is doable with a
group of 57-59th level characters?
