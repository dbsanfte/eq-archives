Congratulations on earning the trust of our scaled superiors.

Skyshrine is definitely wierd, and now, for you, completely safe with one
exception; if you manage to make it past the maze, do NOT go say hi to Lord
Yelinak if he's up, he's the only thing in the zone not on CoV faction, he's
on Lord Yelinak faction, which doesn't go up very easy (well, ok, the 4
spiders aren't on CoV either but they're indiff to all).

WL ports without fear, CS is far less dangerous now, I wouldn't recommend
quadding wyverns unless you were non-kos (if kos root/rotting is still safe,
pull to the beach), drake adds are NASTY.

Using lesser succor, you can go through sirens grotto and explore Western
Wastes without fear, except for one thing, DONT LET CAMO DROP!  Dragons are
the only thing that sees throught invis, but they like you now, I'm fairly
sure the drakes and wyverns are friendly also now, but Ice Burrowers (giant
ass leeches) and velium hounds (dire wolves) are definitely hostile and I'm
not sure about Brontos and mammoths.  I personally waited to come look
around out here until I got Improved Superior Camo, and I'm glad I did.

You can go into Temple of Veeshan safely, although I wouldn't really
recommend going too far in, the zone in up to the hub should be safe, in the
hub, don't open the right hand door as you come in, or the door across the
way (east and north respectively) as things inside there are kos to
everybody, the left door(west) is safe, but there's really no reason to go
in there except to look around, and make sure that if there's people in
there you ask before you open the door, just in case (there's occasionally
an issue with assist agro when the doors get opened while a fight is going
on).

Other than that, just have fun!  Hug a dragon; tell the global auction
channel that Klandicar is up and watch no one care; tell the global auction
channel that Myga is up, and then laugh when the raid that shows up goes
"wtf, where's the dragon?", and don't forget to avoid AoE's if someone is
killing in WW or ToV while you're around (best to just get out of the way
FAST)

Oh yeah, Esorpa of the Ring in WW is on Kunark Ring of Scale faction, so if
that's not up to par you might consider avoiding her and a big area around
her, she spawns just in front of the wyvern cave  (and if you see her and
have bad faction, run away, her AoE has a silence component)

Best place for WW info I've found is here:
