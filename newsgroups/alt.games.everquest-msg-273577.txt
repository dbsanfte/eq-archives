I dunno, I used an invis potion, but it's like he could see invis. My 
faction didn't change even when I was invis. I may try it again, maybe I did 
something wrong. :)

Definitely wasn't the wrong guy; had my DE necro right there with me, and 
the guy is alone in the room with his pet...uh, yeah, definitely not a 
cleric, dunno why I thought that, lol. The DE was able to hand him the wine 
and get the 'experience' (never moved my experience bar) and the faction 
messages (he's to ally now). So, it's definitely the right guy, just have to 
figure out what I'm doing wrong. Invis AFTER opening the trade window, huh? 
May give that a shot.
