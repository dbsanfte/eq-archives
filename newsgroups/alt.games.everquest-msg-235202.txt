It *does* stack.  It just doesn't let you exceed the FT cap (15).
But then I hadn't expected it to.

The FT1-5 you can get from the tribute master is exactly the same
as any other FT.  It adds to whatever FT you already have, but
anything over FT15 doesn't count.

So it's nice for the people who aren't already at FT15, but useless
to those who are.  Well not entirely useless -- it could give them
more flexibility on their item choices, since they could swap out
one or two of their current FT items (making up the lost FT with the
tribute FT) in order to wear an item that's better statwise.

Meanwhile, the bard-enhancing tribute abilities have a similar issue.
Despite the somewhat misleading description given by the tribute master,
they don't "enhance" any instrument skill you may already have, they
instead behave as if you have an additional instrument equipped with
a certain modifier.  At full strength, the modifier is 2.0.  So the
bad news is that if you already have, say, drums with a modifier of
2.0 or higher, the tribute skill won't help your drum skill at all.  Again,
though, it could be used to replace something you'd like to swap out
for something else for other reasons.  And like the bard epic, it
provides a way for a bard to simultaneously "play" more instruments
than they have hands, which is useful (although uber bards will already
have "polyphonic" instruments better than the tribute system can give
them).

The same goes for people who already have Mana Pres IV, etc. etc.

It seems that the tribute system is mostly designed to help characters
in the middle -- high enough to have good items to donate to the
tribute master, but low enough that they aren't already loaded up
with equipment which makes the tribute skills redundant.
