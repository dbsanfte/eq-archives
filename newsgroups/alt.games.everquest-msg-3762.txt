I have vivid dreams where my lvl 35 necromancer is fighting stuff at the top
rim of the 'hole'  and back up to far....starts to free fall...then LOADING,
PLEASE WAIT....

Then

You've been hit for non-melee dmg 10,000
You're bleeding to death
Pain and suffering striked you but miss

LOADING, PLEASE WAIT




Or when I have semi- eq dreams I am talking with my friends in my dream I
see 'a wife' and 'a husband' and automatically i con them. they are green so
i walk away looking for the 'named ones'
