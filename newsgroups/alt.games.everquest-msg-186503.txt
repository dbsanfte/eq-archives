LOL! Where in the world did you come up with this baloney? I'm not
talking about your opinions being worth less because you are a casual
powerplayer. The casual powerplayer's opinions are worth less because
they are bad for the game!

You went off on one hell of a non sequitur. You're going to need a GPS
system to get back to civilization from where you went with this.

Turbine thought that too.

Wonder how many mmorpgs need to fail like AC2 before it turns out that
that just ain't true.

You still don't seem to understand that no one agrees on what is
"needed", to use your word. There is no consensus, so there will be no
selective pandering. All that can be done to cater to the powercasuals
is to dumb the game down.

I'd rather do my best to correct it in the future efforts, as limited
as that may be, by illustrating the problems.

Complete non sequitur. I'd love to hear how you came to that
conclusion.

Ironically, it is you who seems to be trying to squelch alternative
viewpoints by insisting mmorpgs shouldn't do things like make large
worlds with inconvenient travel because YOU don't like it.

Sorry. The elitist, unbending attitude is squarely in the casual
corner. The "memememe nownownownow!" corner. Your corner.

Once again you lock yourself into an "either or" situation. Do you see
anything in colors other than black and white? It's not a matter of
which things to implement and which to leave out, but rather
alternative implementations.

It was irrelevant. Casual powergamers are not the problem, catering to
them is. They're the mouthy minority. Most casual players aren't so
selfish, they just play to have fun and don't feel they're owed
anything but what they earn same as anyone else.

This does not follow. Of course the struggle (metaphorical of course)
is relevant. It is CORE. You seem to be throwing statements out
randomly now in the hopes that something will stick.

Consistency is not your strong point. You just contradicted your own
statement a dozen lines up.
