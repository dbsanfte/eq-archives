From top to bottom while fear kiting

FD
P.E<why you ask..if ya get a add,root cook him,if pet dies root cook>
29 dark
Vex
Splurt<only spell i swap>
Deflux
34 fear
HS

Start demi lich,pull with splurt.pet attack,dark,fear,vex sit and drop
splurt for CoC,cast CoC and sit drop it for any number of dots(depends
on mana or mob) refear as needed,as soon as vex drops you have about
15-20 sec to redark,sometimes i use 59 dark on the resanre if mob is
over 12k hps(never let dark drop even with jboots or run speed 3) 
this works well in SF but i am rarely solo these days i would advise
you group its just more fun
