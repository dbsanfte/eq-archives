1) Book?  I've read quite a few, and since you didn't capitalize
the word, I'm afraid there's little to go on as to what you may
be referring to.

2) Son?  Its vaguely possible but if so you are hiding your email
adress... or Mom was less than forthcoming

3) Top Posting -and- failing to snip?  It might be moral by my
definition, which is to say if you believe its ok to violate the
rules of this newsgroup and of common sense by top posting in a
bottom or responsive post group, and that its fine to waste major
bandwith by including all of a long post just for a little
message free jest... but its not moral by the rule that says that
morality is a consensus affair.

4) so thanks for making this sort of On Topic; thats to say, its
not about EQ, but at least its about the EQ newsgroup we are in
at the moment!
