The very first character I made was a WE ranger on a different server.  One
of the first things I learned how to use was /loc, I have found it to be
invaluable ever since.  That is how I still get around to this day, I always
know what direction I am headed using /loc, sometimes, my Sense Heading
which is on the same hotkey kicks in and confirms that.
