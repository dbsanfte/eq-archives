*shrug*
I have found the casters in MMC especially to be incredibly resistant
to stuns, at least compared to prior experience elsewhere.  With all
the screwing around SOE's done with stuns, and their announcement some
time ago that they had added the feature of being able to make mobs
more resistant to specific spells and/or spell effects, I avoided
generalizing this to a high MR, the more so because of my experience
with Pacify.  I've also watched a couple of Enchanters appear to have
difficulty sticking mez in MMC.  And in Tak my Ranger had over half
his Snare casts resisted.  I probably shouldn't have mentioned roots,
as I have cast less than 10 of them.
