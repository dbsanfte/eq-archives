Hell don't exist sailor... but truthfully, I apologize if I've
offended you... that was not the only point of me posting what I did. 
My aversion to Everquest stems from the fact that friends have ceased
to be friends because of an all emcompassing addiction that has hit
them (and undeniably many other). I am bitter at the game, at it's
power, and at the people who decide, arbitrarily to sacrifice a lot of
things to something that, more than anything else, really won't amount
to a hill a beans at the end of it all.  Maybe Im just optimistic
about people in believing all of us are capable of more than rotting
in front a computer day in and day out.  I've been there myself, don't
think I've never played a good vid or two in my time, and also , don't
think I haven't experienced the feeling of worthlessness at the end of
long weeks of nothing but cathode rays...
Again, I apologize for any offence you might have taken.  Remember...
confidence is a muscle (and I know from first hand experience) it
needs to worked to get stronger.
Cheers
