Travel? Get teleports. Aside from that, travel is a "time sink" in every
MUD-style game. Find a group? That's not so much the "fault" of VI but of
the players. Death? Again, it's a standard time-consuming factor. If you
don't like these things, well, quitting is the best option for you.

Since stats are mostly irrelevant, then what good does the "phat lewtz" do?
So, it comes down the the deciding factor on how good a character is being
the PLAYER... Really, I think this is a GOOD thing.

*Shrug* That was their decision. From what I can tell, fewer people have a
problem with it than those who could really care less.

The game was intended as a group game. Of course they're not going to cater
to soloing -- in fact, they do what they can to encourage grouping over
solo. If you wanna play solo, what the fuck are you playing a MASSIVE
MULTIPLAYER online game for?

All my dealings with CS have been good. That's not to say I haven't heard
negative reports. Not going to comment further here.

It's another MUD-style game standard. It's painful and, frankly, I think
it's perfectly fair.

No, the /con system is supposed to tell you relative level you are to the
mob. Who told you it was meant to tell you for sure whether or not you can
kill it?

It's not an issue of being unable to "make up their minds". It's an issue of
balance issues cropping up as more people play the game and find the
problems. It is IMPOSSIBLE to find every single balance issue during the
course of a beta test. Plus the fact that new content is constantly being
added, which adds even more risk of balance issues popping up. "Nerfs" are
often VITAL to the survival of the game, despite that load of BS article on
"MUD Death" written by some venemous whiner extraordinare...

The expansions have increased the size of the world. More zones are in the
works. But there are limits...

Only so much can be done to elminate camping. In the end, it is again the
fault of the players...

*shrug* to each his own. Toodles.

*disclaimer*

I'm not saying none of the complaints are legitimate. I'm saying most can be
reasonably explained. Most of the complaints are matter of personaly taste.
Implications that the complaints stem from incompetance and lack of effort
on VI's part are simply absurd.

Yeah, I know I'll get ripped for this post. Whatever. If you have a problem,
bite me.
