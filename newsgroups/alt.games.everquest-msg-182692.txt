OK, so Sony sends me an email - "Come on back!  Your old account's still
here!"  Now, I did have an account back in '99 or so - played a warrior up
to around 20, got bored, gave all my stuff away and quit.  Came back about a
year ago.  Getting kind of bored w/ my 38 warrior (if I kill one more
stonegrabber, I'll go apeshit ...), so it might be fun to transfer all my
plat to my 7th wizard and play him for awhile.

Seems to me I could use that old account (30 days free access to it) to
2-box and easily transfer whatever, but the old CD's went in the dumpster
years ago, so I don't have a CD key or anything.  I did get the old
ID/password out of Sony's website.

Any idea how I can activate the old account short of buying new CD's?

Thanks,
Gnardo Lepetomaine
38th warrior
