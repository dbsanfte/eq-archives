Just posting my thoughts on the NEW new Nektulos Forest on the test
servers.

I like it. It's what we should have originally gotten. If you overlay
the map from the original Nektulos forest with this one, they almost
match up 1:1. Some nice added effects include ground mists that obscure
the ground and fog that obscure the entrance to the MM zone-in. The
zone transition to Lavastorm could still use a little work, but is a
huge improvement. Most of all, the zone is open again, instead of
suddenly turning every character into a pansy who can't wander between
a few trees and through some underbrush.

That original Nektulos forest revamp really bugged me, and I for one am
very happy to see the open, wander-anywhere map return. Here's to
hoping they take the legs off the piranha before it goes live :)
Let Sony know they did at least something right. Even if it was
reactionary.

Xiphos - Yeah, the $99 thing sucks, but who didn't see that coming?
Seriously? Please don't respond to the sig, the other thread is for
that.
