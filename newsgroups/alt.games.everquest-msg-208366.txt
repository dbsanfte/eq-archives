Something's gone wrong on my EQ =(

Got booted from EQ this afternoon, np..happens sometimes, reloaded the game,
when I passed through the logon procedure i was asked if I wanted to
pre-order LDoN, sure I clicked and was promptly told that my order had been
successful.

Once i clicked my server from the select screen after that, the game hung..
did nothing for a few mins, so I pressed escape, and It took me back to
desktop.

Relaunched EQ, and it started to patch a file for guk, guka.** or somesuch,
when I finally made it through to character select, all my chars were in the
old style graphics. Sooo, I went into the options screen, made sure they
were all correct...and tried again, still no joy, no matter what I do now, I
won't let me load the luclin character graphics...  Any idea's anyone?  or
anyone had a similar problem today?
