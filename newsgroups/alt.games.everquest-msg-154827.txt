Snip>I feel that they need to know the status of the guild is, but it still
seems like every day more and more people are >leaving. Any advice on what
to do to rebuild and boots morale?

I was a member of a guild that had similiar problems.  I really liked a lot
of the people in the guild and I was determined to stick it out and help
rebuild, but it didn't work and the guild disbanded.  While not everything
that happens among officers should be discussed with all guild members it
becomes difficult for guild members to make a decision to stay or go when
they have no idea what the problems are.  They really have no way of knowing
if the guilds problems will affect them or not. This guild had a lot of
problems among officers and a lot of bad blood that I was not aware of when
I joined.  All of their discussions were kept private, so I was compeletely
mystified to find out there were problems.

Also, the original guild leader left the guild (to join one with higher
level members) and handed over the reins to another player, as in your
situation, but she never really let-go of the guild.  She resented the fact
that she had not been relieved of responsibilities and the guild resented
her intrusion.   In the end she sabotaged any chance we might have had to
rebuild the guild.  I think at that point she just wanted out and didn't
care if she was the scapegoat.  I enjoyed this guild immensely and I was
very saddened to see it disband.

I hope that your guild has a better ending than mine.  From my experience I
can tell you to give the members as much information as you can, without
naming names, so they can decide for themselves if the problems will affect
them or not. Keep an open forum for guild members. If there are former
members causing problems, block them from posting, but do not censor your
boards.  Also, take a look at who is leaving.  More is not always better.
You may end up with only a small core group, but from there you can
stabilize and rebuild.     Good Luck
