   To be fair, I was about the fourth person to suggest to the person
that they wrap their lines.  I guess I just did it a more rigorous
(bitchy?) manner than the others.  For what its worth, I saw your post
that started this side discussion as being unwrapped as well.

    So anyone know a way I can get netscape 4.61 to wrap incoming
messages?
