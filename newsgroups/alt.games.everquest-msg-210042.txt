I have a L57 bard who has lagged somewhat in the defensive skills and is
starting to work on that.  I have so far made good progress in defense but
no progress at all in parry and dodge.  Defense has gone from 208 to 226,
parry is stuck at 152, and dodge is stuck at 160.  I am fighting dark blue
mob.  Is there anything else I need to do, or are these two skills just
insanely difficult to raise?
