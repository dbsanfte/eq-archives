I think it won't be a problem in the future as I could not imagine twisting
3 songs before but your hotkeying scheme worked beautifully and it is easy
now. I just need the "automation" to set in before I add in the next level
of complexity. I find my eyes are busy all over the screen at the moment,
checking song effects in the text screen and still needing to view the spell
timer bar to keep timing, that will ease eventually.

As for wind instrument - I only got to play a bit tonight and did not fight
enough to notice any difference apart from maybe placebo effect. It *felt*
like I was having better luck landing then with the Mino Horn but.....  One
day when I can get a good session in I will try some log file parsing.
