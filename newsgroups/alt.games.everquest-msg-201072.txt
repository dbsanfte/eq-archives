The bard effect on Rizlona's stacks with the item effect on my summoned
bracer - I was getting Firebolts hitting 2500 the other day with both
of them (my current max is 2328 on FoT).

Blessing of Reverence (cleric spell haste buff - 10%) stacks with my
Naki's ring or my Brell's Girdle (Summoning Haste III) giving me
25% and 40% reductions in cast time respectively.
