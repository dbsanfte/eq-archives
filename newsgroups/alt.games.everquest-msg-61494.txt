Ya know, when this thread started out, I found myself thinking "what a
stupid fucking discussion. They're your *spells*! You put them in the
book and mem them as needed. Case closed." 
But now that I read this and other previous responses, I find myself
realizing that I'm the fucking idiot. (again. Duh.) Back when I was
playing my wizard, and currently with my necro, I simply get a new
circle of spells, and scribe them into the book on the next pair of
pages. If I get more at one level than fit on a pair of pages, they
either spill over onto the next page, or take up an empty slot on the
previous pages if I didn't fill them up at that level.
  This does, however, make it a time consuming pain in the ass to find
and re-mem my spells after a death, or to set up my "travel line" of
spells when done hunting, moving etc., or my "training line" of spells
when I'm in town working on casting skills, etc.
  I can see now how this could be useful, and I think one of the first
things I'm going to do after the patch (and the nightmare of upgrading
hardware and software) is to re-do my spell book. Thanks! These were
some great tips!
