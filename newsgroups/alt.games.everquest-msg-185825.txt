A while back there was a bug with zoning into certain places (Circle of
Commons druid port spell was one)
Where if someone had just zoned in and was stading in your "spawn spot" you
would land on top of that player and proceed bouncing down and back up
repeatedly getting hit for fall damage of about 60hp each time.
My poor little druid of lvl 20-ish at the time with some 500hp was killed
several times from this and got a CS Rez every time.

But for falling off a naturally occuring piece of geography, no way they
should give CS Rez for that.. That's what safe fall skill and levitation
spells are for. Or just common carefulness when travelling in new lands.
