You've got it. There are times when everything switches back to the lower
needs, and everything else gets put on hold for a bit until those lower
needs are met.

Doing something becuase you want, and having others uderstand what you want,
would be a self-esteem and trust issue.

Actually extremes like addiction or exhibitionistic tendancies woudl be
eliminated if the needs were met.  Addictions are a way of filling some
other need, and if all needs are met then there is no need to form an
addiciton in an attempt to fill a need.

They do tend to meld together.  With whatever philosophy you look at, they
all start at a basic level, and as an individual progresses and advances,
one move to a higher level.

I didn't do this particular one at this time, but I've done several of these
over the course of my sutdies (and many for fun in the years since).

That's the thing about social sciences.....they're's always room for more.

This is not one of the better explanations of Kohlberg I've found, but it
was one of the easiest to follow.

I honestly didn't take the time to try it.

I know someone who did a doctoral thesis based on the gender-differentiated
moral development in purchasing situations.  Very interesting reading -- if
I could remember enough of it to share clearly, I would.  A good portion of
it has leaked from my brain over the past few years, however.
