Trying to log in... but I keep getting that stupid 1001 error...
"Can't log in to Everquest servers... try again shortly."

Been getting it for a few hours now...

I recently f--ked around with the Network settings ont he computer,
and multiple users, windows family logon, and crap like that.  I think
I've got it all back to the way it was before.

But now it seems like EQ won't log in.  All my other internet programs
are working perfectly.

Anyone have any ideas as to what might be wrong?
