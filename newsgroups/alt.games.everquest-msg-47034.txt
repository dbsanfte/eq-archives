Which of course, was a futile and useless moronic thing for them to do,
because no one can afford spells, let alone the cost of dumping 50+
training points into a language so you -can- group effectively with others
of differing races and presumably differing alignments. If you can't
communicate in a group you're useless and you're just going to get your
group, or maybe just yourself, killed. I know. I've tried it.

When someone tells the group "xTewvE x tY uwpv aitl'q!", do you assume
it means "Great! I do mega blasts!" or does it really mean "ZONE! a SG
just agro'd!"  ???

Verant == idiots.
