EQ uses a fair bit of bandwidth, and in my neck of the woods at least 
high-speed wireless is extremely expensive once you go over the monthly 
allotment. ($6.00 per MB yeah MB with an M. $40 to dl a single 10 minute 
mp3...once you've used up your allotment).

Even the biggest data plan with my local Wireless 1x ISP ( the so called 
'Unlimited' plan) is unofficially capped at 100MB per month, which for 
email and light surfing is fine... but you don't download mp3s, movies, etc.

Last I checked EQ used a fair bit of bandwidth. (I had a friend once who 
played a lot, 2 boxxing, who claimed he measured a months worth, and 
apparently pushed multiple GBs through)

(even 1GB is 900MB over the allotment... so 900MBx$6/MB is a $5400.00 
phone bill...though I'd expect you could work out a better personalized 
rate with their 'corporate sales team' at that level of consumption)

But I don't have any numbers to go with that. Perhaps someone else can 
elaborate on EQ bandwidth usage.

Anyways, the point is... cost out your bandwidth requirement before 
making a wireless decision.
