You pay more per month ($40 instead of $10) and for that you get more GM's
and GM events, unique items/artifacts (that may then fitler down to normal
servers)
The service has upset a fair number of people due to that fact they see that
it's a service we should all get anyway. Not sure I agree there.
Doesn't really bother me, I have thought about moving over to one of these
servers but given that I am not really a serious player I don't see it as
worth it.

It is probably upsetting the uber guilds more than players like me, they
have been asking for more content for them and new challenges and now they
seem to have got it they will have to pay $40/mnth for it (whether or not
the GM events will be geared to word the 55+ crew or not I don't know)

One thing I do wonder about is the possible naming of items after players
who get them first.
Will this filter down to normal servers so we'll get Ubadorf's axe of
cleaving or something similar...hmm I guess if Verant can have mobs like
Tolapmuj (Jump a lot backwards) and his robe or even Doljonijiarnimorinar
(what was that end of a game of scrabble and all the letters left?)
Speaking of Ubadorf there is a GM/Guide on bristlebane with the
surname/title "The UberGnome" was going to petition it :ï¿½)
