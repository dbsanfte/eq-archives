Biz has Not yet made real life threats, he has posted yours and Tony's
Addresses.  Personally, I don't care for you, but you do tend to
contribute, so like taras, and Bomma, I'm not going to KF you, Morse
will work his way back into My KF.  As a troll, he's worse than Vengy. 
IF Bizbee has a carry license in SF/Bay area, that means that his
criminal record is better than spotless, as(anecdotally) I've heard that
its difficult for Law enforcement officers to get off duty carry permits
in that area.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
