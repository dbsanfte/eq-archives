If you're talking about getting stuff that's way above your level, the
differences become more exaggerated, yes.  This is more an issue on older
servers (ok, eventually all servers) where you can get nice stuff dirt cheap
in the bazaar.  Maybe low grade or common 50ies gear can be considered
"normal" for a level 35 now on many servers.  I'm really talking about those
who are equipped with Ivy, Crafted, and the like, not Barbed Ringmail from
Velks.
