Isn't the same thing. Ever read bug reports? Ever read complaint
forms? I have and most of them are nearly unintelligible. Most of the
ones I read are written by professionals with Masters and Ph.D.
degrees in a scientific community. They even spell worse than I do.

I tell people to always have a greeting ready and an exploratory
question. You are not getting any new information; you are gauging the
attitude of the person. When you have to greet people in varying
degrees of panic a hundred times a day, then you tend to use the same
first two questions. It's a fact of life. We use humans to do this
job, and they tend to repeat their work.

The problem is the writer/customer. Remember this is a one sentence
petition, which may contain dood-speak. You make the assumption they
don't read the petition.

They may not understand it because the writer wasn't clear. They may
not have figured out what category it is in, there isn't enough
information. The answer may already be no, and they are looking to see
what the attitude is of the person making the request.

Probably most likely, and the one that needs elaboration is the next
one.

They may be sending the tell at the same time they are reading the
sentence you wrote in the petition, because they have 200 petitions
stack up. People like Ben Sisson complain that the response time is
too long, so they have to shave seconds off the time to respond.

I don't do resolution of problems real time so I don't have this
problem. I usually either rewrite the code myself, or send it along
for analysis. They have to explain how it is to the customer and can
do minimal quick fixes in the data pool. A full GM has to do
everything else.

Obviously you have a chip on your shoulder. Why else would you assume
that they don't read the petition.
