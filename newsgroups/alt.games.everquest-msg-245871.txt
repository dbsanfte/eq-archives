They sort of do this in DAoC.  Items that you drop on the ground cannot be
picked up by other players, so if you want a tradeskiller to repair an item
of yours, you can drop it, and they can repair it, but they can't steal it.

One of the DAoC tradeskills is spellcrafting, and one of the things
spellcrafters can do enhance armor and weapons with stats, resists, bonuses,
focuses, and stuff like that.  I don't know if you have to hand them the
item for them to do this, or if it is like repairing items.  Anyway, this
might be an example of something kind of like what you are
suggesting--tradeskillers able to make good loot better (or good tradeskill
items better...e.g., you might buy a great sword from a weaponsmith, and
then have it made better by a spellcrafter).
