I can remember when I first started in dreadlands, there were 
some spanish asshats that would charm and buff and equip 
drolvargs and run them around til charm dropped and watch them 
hit the nearest group that got agro.  It was nice being able to 
report them because one oopsed and in /say instead of /gsay or 
/tell commented on how fun it was watching the pets kill baby 
groups.

Did I mention I also can read spanish=) I may be a dumb american, 
but I can deal with a few non-english languages=)
