Because you've told the other player you don't want their assistance.
If they continue to "assist" you, after you've made it clear it's
unwanted, they're harassing you.

You could make exactly the same complaint about someone following you
around healing you, or buffing you, or debuffing the mobs you're
fighting, or spamming provoke so most of the mobs aren't hitting you.

All of those things are also "PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE behavior" and
considered by most to be beneficial, but if you don't want them, and you
tell them you don't want them, and they continue to "help" you against
your wishes, that's harassment.

Do you want their help?  
NO.
Did you tell them you don't want their help?  
Yes.
Did they continue to help you anyway? 
Yes.
Then they're guilty of harassment.
It's just that simple.
