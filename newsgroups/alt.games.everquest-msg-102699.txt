Everyone just about oom, I have a mob mezzed,and we are waiting for the
cleric to get back mana. After about 15 seconds sitting arfound, mage sends
in her pet to attack, breaks mez and half the party get wiped out. "Oh, it
was a mistake" is all she could say.

Druid is on heals, proceeds to cast regeneration on everyone, then does 300
point heals when they are down 250. Always cures everyone up to full at the
end of each combat, and then announces "1m, I need to med".
Druid/ranger/warrior/enchanter are managing about 1 pull every 2-3 minutes
in dreadlands. Npt surprisingly group disbands after about 10 minutes of
this.

Combat goes bad, everyone is running to zone and hit points are low, sso
movement is slow. Im about to die, and succesfully get a mez off on the
puirsuing mob and start running. Warrior comes along behind and bravely
engages mob. I die. He was trying to save me... he says.

Wizard standing by our party getting clobberd, asks "do you want this
sarnak?". Ok, I mez it while we wait to kill the current mob. Wiz then
proceeds to nuke mezzed mob. Wiz gets clobbered, but succesfully KS's the
mob. I suppose he figured he wanted his mob back.

Then there are the people who persist in breaking mez before the warrior has
taunted, even after you ask them several times to stop doing it. Are these
people deaf, or do they just not understand english?

/sigh
