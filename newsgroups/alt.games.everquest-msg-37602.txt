And I sure as hell wish people would STOP FRIGGING 
TRAINING THEM ON ME.

*ahem*  Yes. Friend dragged me over tonight.  Was okay 
fighting the Kobolds but where the hell do you med?  If 
I sat down outside the camps, a wandering kobold or 
worse, a wandering kitty, would find me and kick my ass 
in 3 hits.  I gave up and started climbing the wall to 
med.  At which point I started getting people training 
the damn cats past me and they'd aggro on ME.  I climbed 
ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP OF THE BLOODY WALL.  I didn't go 
sit in the one exit OUT of Stonebrunt and med and then 
bitch about getting hit with a train.  And yet still, I 
got hit with a train.

So, yes. :) Where do we med?  Or do we just put up with 
the trains until it empties out a little?

On another note, it was DAMN busy in there.  Do the # of 
mobs correspond to the # of people in the zone?  Because 
if it *does* get empty in there, it might be hard to 
pull with so very very *very* many wandering mobs.
