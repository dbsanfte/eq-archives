I was joking about the .001 seconds. The zone I was left in was one away
from East Commonlands (but not West Commonlands if that helps). Sorry,
I'm so new at this that the names are a jumble so far. There were some
nasties where I was for a while. Crossed into E Commonlands and survived
near an inn until the wizard took pitty. Now I'm back in familiar
territory...
