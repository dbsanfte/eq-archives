One of the reasons they instituted the cap was because a single group of
level 60s killed Nagafen.  Nagafen and Vox were the tough encounters,
pre-Kunark and had been balanced with the level 50 cap in mind.

Raising the level cap introduces the possibility of a single group of 70s
killing today's ubermobs.  I don't think they'd want to go over every
encounter in the game and rebalance it.
