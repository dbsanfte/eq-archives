I am a high elf / magician and I just reached lvl6. It seemed to take an
extremly long time to get from lvl5 to lvl6. Does it always take this long
to lvl? I'm not sure about how lvling works. How many monsters do I need to
kill before the lvl meter will move? Does each monster give you different
exp or is it the number of monsters that you kill what gives you exp? I have
been currently fighting at the gates of west freeport near the East
commonlands, should I be fighting elsewhere...where the monsters are
stronger? Is there any better ways or faster ways to get exp? Also, can
anyone give advice on my training according to my class and race? What
should I be practicing at these early lvls?
Sorry so long, but we've all been here with q's at one point
Thanks in advance
Mik
