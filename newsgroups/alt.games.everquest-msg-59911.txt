Any suggestions for a innoruk worshipping half elf warrior?  I am kos to
all of nek/neriak which considering i worship the same god, kinda
sucks.  If a half elf can worship inny, then they ought to make you
something less than scowls to all of the factions there.  I know it's
race based, but what about those of us, who want to roleplay at being a
half dark elf, hence the inny worship.  Yes you can get someone to help
you with the invis, but as you mention it won't raise your other
factions.  I know turning in Lightstones in s. ro can raise the same
factions raised with the wine quest, but they won't take my stones
either, and IIRC I can sell to them, which doesn't make sense that they
wouldn't take the stones.  I get the I will do nothing to help your kind
message again IIRC.  Also at least some of the halflings in nek forest
do not raise your faction with neriak.  The ones that are at the
abandoned druid ring, just lower them with rivervale, no positives from
killing them.
