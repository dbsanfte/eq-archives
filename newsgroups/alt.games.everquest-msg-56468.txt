How is the speed of it for you?  For both me and a friend, here's how
it goes:

1. Launch testeverquest.  Nothing happens for several seconds, making
us wonder if we bothced double-clicking.  Finally, the first stage
patcher comes up (the one with the very simple progress dialog).
After a while that goes away and there is another long pause.

2. The fancy-looking patcher you describe comes up, and says it is
determining what needs to be patched.  This takes a LONG time, and
there is no network activity while it is happening.  It uses a lot of
CPU and makes it very hard to do things like browse while waiting.

3. Once it decides what needs to be patched, it goes well.

Overall, I find its slowness and resource hogging annoying enough that
if this is how it is for SoL, I don't think I'll be buying SoL (and if
I don't buy SoL, I'll be spending about a month doing some things on
my EQ todo list to get to a nice stopping point, and then retiring).
