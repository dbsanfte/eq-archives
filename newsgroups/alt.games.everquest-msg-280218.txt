By not cancelling your account after the price hike was announced, you 
were tacitly agreeing to the increased price, thereby authorizing them to 
charge you card that is on record for the amount of the increased price.  
They mistakenly undercharged your card, and have now made a second charge 
on the card for the difference, at no additional cost (over what you had 
already agreed to) to you, they are eating the cost of the extra 
transaction (Each transaction costs them money, small transactions 
typically cost them a larger percentage of the charge).

If, OTOH, you had cancelled your account prior to the announced price 
hike, then, there is no issue, as you would not have been charged either 
the mistaken amount, or the additional amount to bring the total charge 
to the correct amount.

Overall, I am reasonably certain they are on solid ground legally, 
however, I am not a legal expert.

I think we can all agree, that in the interest of customer satisfaction, 
it would have been best for them to just forgo the difference, and start 
charging the increased price as of the next billing cycle.
