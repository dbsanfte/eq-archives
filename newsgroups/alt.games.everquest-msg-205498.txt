Well I was bored enough to test it.  The following all visibly stack
on the pet.  This means nothing though as I've had SoV and Celerity
icons up often enough - this doesn't mean the haste is stacking.

HoS
SQ
Guardian
Alacrity

Still a worthless spell though unless you count being able to add a
little STR (I think the worthlessness of STR buffs had been proved
often enough) or AC to your pet for a small amount of time
worthwhile.  I don't so it never gets memmed.  I couldn't find anyone
at the Crucible who uses it either.  YMMV.
