Well at 21 I doubt I have the mana to nuke her down. I do have a question
tho. I fought Shilster a lot in NK for exp. Stumbled over an easy solution
to his HT and I think it'd be worth trying on Equestrielle. Zone in,
charm an animal of some kind, and sic it on her, and immediately head for
the zone.

With Shilster, the HT was always his opening move, and he always dropped
it on whatever I had charmed to attack him. If Equestrielle is the same,
that'd burn her HT for 90 minutes, yes? It'd make it a LOT easier hunting
in there if I knew she wouldn't be able to nuke me if she agros. (I'd
still have to zone but she wouldn't be able to almost insta-kill me for 90
minutes)

Thoughts?
