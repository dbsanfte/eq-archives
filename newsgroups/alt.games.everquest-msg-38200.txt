Of course, DAoC has not only an exact equivalent of the TCC (in fact, it
is pretty likely where Verant got the idea from), it also has several
other features of a similar nature, including anti-camping code that
reduces the exp gotten from multiple kills of the same spawn over time.
Also, correct me if I am wrong (not being in the Beta) I think there is
no equivalent to kiting.

Damn those evil developers who insist on people actually playing their
games, instead of treating them as a form of self-inflicted torture
device...
