Probably because us shamans get used to fighting with a Paladin or SK as 
the MA, and know that we will not get aggro when we slow on incoming.  If 
a warrior is the MA, then I wait before slowing, but, if it's a Pally or 
SK, or ranger for that matter, there is no need, I will not get hit, and 
it will save the healer, which may be me, mana.

Yep, most agree that the AGI buff is useless, well, most shamans anyway, 
I cast it on people if they ask for it, I don't otherwise.
