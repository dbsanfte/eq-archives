I did say generally... I think I recall some mobs that are slow in the
water but not on land, but I can't remember which they were.

Specters are a solo cleric's best friend, by the way, since they
move at snared speed... this makes it possible to use fear
and nuke tactics to take them down with ease, without needing
a snaring partner.

There are quite a few mobs that are slower than strafe running,
so you don't need snare to pull them safely, but that doesn't give
you a comfortable margin to stop, spin, and cast during... or
enough time to cast on a feared mob before it goes out of range.
Gotta love them presnared mobs... anyone know of any others?
