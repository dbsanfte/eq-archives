Check to see you don't have other applications running that do background
activities.

Turn off VisruScan updates, or programs like "Real Player" or Kaaza that do
plenty of Internet things while you are busy.

I played on a dial-up for a while and had to make sure my PC was "air-tight"
so the extra load on the bandwidth didn't Linkdeath me.

Since your computer is the only "real" variable here look there to fix the
problem.
