: Well, a couple things.
:
: STR factors (minorly) in there somewhere, but I forget where.
:
: Also, you forgot a modal. A modal is mode/delay, and represents the single
: best way to compare weapons. Higher modal = higher DPS.

STR only figures in for the MAX as is expressed in  MAX =
((skill+STR)/100)*damage+Damage Bonus

I didn't go into how to use this information to judge what makes a better
weapon, primaraly because the original poster only wanted to know why he
averaged 2 X the damage on his weapon.  You are the first person that has
broght up Modal outside a group I had a discusion with last month.

And for everyone out there this is how to figure out your best weapon. Modal
= (2*damage)+Damage Bonus/hasted delay.

To figure out hasted delay: Delay/(1+Haste) = Hasted Delay  You can find out
most items haste here

As always hope this helps.
