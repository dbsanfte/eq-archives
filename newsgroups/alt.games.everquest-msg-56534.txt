I don't think I can agree with this, although perhaps I'm overlooking
something.  Remedy, Celestial Healing, and Complete Heal all
have relatively low taunt factors.  Superior Heal is shared with
Shaman and Druids, so that wouldn't put clerics at the top of
the scale alone, either.  Stuns, despite what people tell me,
rarely seem to get aggro off anyone either.  Lets see, what
else could I be doing to annoy things that I'm not.  AOE
nukes?  Never used em much till I got my Donal's Boots,
but no, they don't seem especially annoying.  Root?  Well,
I suppose that is a little annoying, but I haven't noticed
it being -that- big a taunt, and its hardly cleric only.  One
of my favorites is Flash of Light, but Paladins and Shaman,
at a minimum, also have that available.  Fear?  That could
be what you are talking about, except that necros, shadowknights,
and yes, Enchanters (my personal vote for best taunt) all get
that too.
