Thats an entirely different problem.  Reportedly Summon Corpse cannot be used on
anyone 61+, just as Lesser Summon Corpse cannot be used on anyone 35+ (might be
wrong level, but I'm close).

Gonna hurt, no doubt about that.. but only for the low level necromancer who now
can't pull it off even with his "takes a space" more expensive coffins.  Good
news on the other hand for the high level necro, who isn't going to be usurped
quite so often by "barely high enough" necro bots.
