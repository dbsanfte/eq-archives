}So tell me, Oh Smart One, what laws you consider to grant "special

Affirmative action did arguably fit that description.  It was gotten rid 
of in California a couple years back.  They're now working to acieve much 
the same goal through what are called outreach programs, which Appears to 
be a much more logical approach, that does not grant these special rights.

It's a harder way to do it, but personally, I think it's better, and we 
never would have tried it with the easy affirmative action plan in place.
