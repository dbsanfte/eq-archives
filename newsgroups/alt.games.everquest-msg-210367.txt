This is technically true, LoIO, Warsilks, FoB, and... one other I'm
forgetting are all Iksar Newbie zones, and one of the reasons LoIO was so
popular for the 20 to 30 crowd was that it had exp giving mobs for them but
a newbie zone ZEM.  I did find it very difficult to solo there at level one
or two, but after that its a pretty good newbie zone actually, and some of
the quest parts you need drop only there off the seldom visited newbie mobs.

That said, I assume that LoIO wasn't included in the free sample newbie
zones for purposes of the map system, since the OP says he gets FoB but not
LoIO.

Personally I have no way to test that assumption, I have only one account,
and it had LOY on it well before they added the free sample deal, so LoIO
and FoB have always been featured on the LOY map system for me.
