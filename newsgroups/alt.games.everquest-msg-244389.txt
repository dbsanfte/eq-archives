Yes, but does Trueshot ever stop suddenly and without warning? And if so, 
do you get turned into foie-gras when it happens? I do my fair share of 
charming in PoP, and it's plenty stressful, despite the facts that a) my 
mobs produce much lower DPS than what an Enchanter can get, so I'd 
rarely get one-rounded, b) while Druids are made of cardboard, 
Enchanters are made of wet toilet paper, and c) my mobs are always 
Ensnared, a privilege Enchanters don't get.

The damage Enchanter can put out using charm is sick, but it's my 
opinion that they earn it.
