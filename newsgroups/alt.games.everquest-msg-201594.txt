I think that half price is probably due to the loss of 38 raw AC (hey monks,
check your equipment...  do you even *have* anything with 38 raw AC?  I've
got a grand total of 2, one of which I don't even wear normally).

Legs are on my list to get.  Soon as my guild actually catches AoW up.  :)
I'm wearing ornate, but I was an AC freak for far too long before the big
monk nerf to have totally lost my desire for a 60 AC item.
