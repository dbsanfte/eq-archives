I'd just say to be careful with anything specific like this (strategy) that
you /petition to a GM.  If they feel it is an exploit, but not enough for
discipline action against you, it could simply be something "fixed" in the
next patch.  Maybe even if they feel OK about it, but just don't think its
right, or is meant to work that way, or maybe bragging about this and
someone who thinks it shouldn't be done finds a way to "fix" it in the next
patch.
