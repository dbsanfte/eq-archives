I'm not saying that rogues won't take a little less damage, I'm
saying rather that they'd have to take MUCH less damage in order
to make up for running stoicism on themselves thru the run of the
fight.

Shaman make great sponges -because- they can just stand there
taking the hits and regenerating the damage while their pet (and
rogue buddy, in this case) do the killing.

Depends on your definition of "reasonable"... or more to the
point, "tank".

Personally, although I've used the word in this thread, I think
its ill advised, I much prefer "sponge".  Sponges soak up damage,
whether they are also dealing damage while doing so is
irrelevant.

I'm reasonably sure that a shaman will sponge up damage better
than a rogue, not because he'll get hit less often or for fewer
points of damage, but rather because, not caring about his damage
output, he can stay stoic/torpored thru the whole fight.

It would be possible of course to do the same to the rogue... but
if you want someone who can sponge well you might as well get a
sponge class rather than turn the rogue into one by cutting his
damage output to a third (15% loss from not being behind, 35%
loss from no BS, and I forget how much loss from Stoicism or
Torpor, but 33% wouldn't be an unfair guess)
