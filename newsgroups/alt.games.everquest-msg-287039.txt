First the 85 rule was changed, it's now 5+1 for everywhere that allows it.
For every 5 people in the group or raid you can bring 1 unflagged person.

For PoP (assuming NO flags)

PoTranq 46
Storms/Valor/CoD 55
BoT/HoH/Torment 62
Tactics - Flagged only
Sol Ro - Flagged only but the 'new' alt-access flag is trivial (kill 1 mob
in Western Wastes that doesn't summon)

For GoD not sure but heard there was originally a level 60 requirement on
Qinimi, and Tipt/Vxed *might* be restricted somehow.
Kod`taz 65 (I think, but not 100% certain)

For OoW
MPG 65
RSS 69
Others not sure

DoN - 15 level gap but the average must be of the right level to get the
right mission and some progression tasks require a minimum average level to
get them
