KEYWORD: Clueless.
The difference is night and day. I seriously hope that you've just
dropped into your Bizbee patented "I already said something, so now I
have to defend it to the death even if I'm fucked up" mode. Because if
you really believe that, you're not quite as bright as I normally credit
you for.

Not being in game: Duh. You're not in the game. You couldn't help
somebody or do anything if you wanted to. Nobody is online 24/7, and
some people aren't even on line daily. That's understood. If you're not
online, you're... well... not online.

Not having it on: You *are* in game. You're just not interested enough
in the affairs of your guildmate's to bother with the "blathering text".
Translation: *YOU* don't need anything from *THEM* right now, so don't
you don't want to be bothered. And yeah, they could send you a /tell if
it was that critical for you to be there. Hell, why not just send
*everyone* a tell? That will only add and extra hour to the setup by the
time everyone knows what/where everyone else is up to. Hell, why have a
/gu channel at all? Biz, you normally make a lot of sense on many
subjects, but on this one, I gotta say.... dude, you need to #squeeze
that Sterno through more slices of bread# before you drink it in the
future.

that reference.)
