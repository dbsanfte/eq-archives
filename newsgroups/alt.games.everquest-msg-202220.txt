Thanks for posting this, Caeli. It turns out that I still had the old update
on the computer. As soon as I removed it, I noticed the improvement I had
before when I removed it. It's nice to know that I won't have to worry about
keeping an eye out for it anymore. Not used to having a company address a
bug in such short order. I'm used to the folks at EQ addressing them about a
year or two later....if ever.  ;)

Thanks again everyone for the help
