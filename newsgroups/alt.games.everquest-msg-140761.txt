Interesting.  I actually tried to find this on allakazam but searching
there revealed nothing.  Actually it's not the first time that a
search engine found something there that the sites search didn't.  I
had used hotbot to try and find info on this but it turned up empty
too.  Funny thing to have in the game.   Thanks for the post with the
information.   

Qiset.
