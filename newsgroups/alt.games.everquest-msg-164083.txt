No, I'm a glutton, I triple a Monk/Shaman/Wizard combo.

Yes who the *fuck* cares.

If I was likely to have a shot at uberguild fodder, I wouldn't have an
issue, I'd already have much better weapons.  It's the msinstream player
that has no access to upgrades for Monk weapons and they *still* don't.

15/20 is not significantly better at L65 with a THIRTEEN point damage
bonus, go run the maths before makign such fuckwitted statements.  You
also lose your Epic buff (40 ATK), yuor Epic haste if working without
better along with a 100hp hand item (go find a better that a mainstream
player can access) and fuck knows how many HP, Resists etc from losing
any weapons you might have.

18/20 would have been an option - not one everyone would take but an
option nonetheless.  15/20 is fuckign worthless.
