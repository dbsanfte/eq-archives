Yeah, only the really popular ones.  :)

Win95 drivers get rolled into the Win98 drivers since they used a
common driver model.  WinXP doesn't use Win9X driver models (it
actually uses Win2K model).

The more accurate analogy would be Win9X vs. Windows 3.1.
How many Windows 3.1 drivers do you see floating around for major
hardwares these days?

When did manufacturers pretty much stopped producing Windows 3.x
drivers?  

Win95 came out in 1995, around 96/97 time frame it was DAMN hard to
find any current Windows 3.x drivers for many pieces of hardware.
What little was available were dead code branches and was often buggy
as hell.

In about 2 years, I doubt there will be much if any Win9X development
coming out of hardware manufacturers--these guys are on a very tight
schedule and are working with very limited resources.
