It amounts to your being difficult. You owe them the money. You've 
authorized them to charge a certain amount, yet now complain about the 
manner in which they did it, though it caused you no undue hardship, 
distress or even a slight inconvenience.

No, but if you opened your wallet and told them to reach in and get it, 
yet they didn't pull out enough with the first attempt, you certainly 
wouldn't look down your nose at them for going in for the rest?

See my above example. It's more approptiate.

In your opionion. What you suggest is the sort of thing that increases 
costs.

Why would it, when I had accounted for that expense, anyway?

I don't recall authorizing them to charge any other cards for my EQ 
service. If I had, then yes, I would not only *not* be jumping up and 
down, but I would *expect* them to do so.

Easy does it with the rhetoric. A little goes a long way.
