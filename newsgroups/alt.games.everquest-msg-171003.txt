At 182 skill i got 1 sp a few times, but usually nothing or a 1 cp.
Dont get aggro any more though, at least not from normal mobs. Might get 
from the "beggar hating" NPCs (guard fayfear at orc lift in GFay HATE 
beggars, go try :)).
Oh, and a funny thing about begging, when i were bored in Qeynos 
Catacombs doing the Paw of Opolla quest, i had great fun training 
begging on one of the beggars, untill he aggroed me while saying "i 
really hate beggars like you". Wonder how he feel about himself.
