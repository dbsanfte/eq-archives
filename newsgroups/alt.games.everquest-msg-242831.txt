There are ways of making a decent amount of money to get the gear you 
need at your level. Farming spider/spiderling silks, low-quality 
wolf/cat/bear/rockhopper skins (if you can skill up in tailoring to make 
leather padding, even better) and various other tradeskill components 
that are in high demand is one. You just have to take a break from that 
light-speed levelling you've been doing thusfar is all.

You have every right to be compensated for the expense. Personally, I 
would try to keep plenty of dots on me and just ask people to cover the 
cost before buffing them. Alternately, you could require them to provide 
the dots, though I don't see that very often. I have however seen many 
*tanks* that do keep dots on hand for just such occasions.

I wouldn't agree to be the ML as a cleric. You need your free time to be 
available for medding as necessary.
