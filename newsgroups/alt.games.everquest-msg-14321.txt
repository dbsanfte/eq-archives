receive emails.

Ahhh Okay we will get an engineer out shortly

Engineer arrives (me)

Scratches head, ISDn dials up, can't ping servers, no throughput. Scratches
head. Tracers all over network, Scratches head. hmmm, Close down DNS, clear
all IPs reload all, no pings. Entire network virus hunt, scratches head.
Uninstall ISDn and network card, reload (windows is rebooting, isnt that
nice) , no ping to main server at ISp , scratches head..

Ahhh, the AOL.exe virus has been installed. Uninstall, wot do you mean it
won't uninstall. delete files manually and remove it all from registry etc.

Dial up ISP ,, Viola all works nicely. Sign here your company will get a
nice bill for some asshole installing the 6zillion hours 'Free' trial..
