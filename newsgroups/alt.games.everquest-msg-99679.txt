I can't speak for Tarew Marr, but the best place for a 50+ enchanter
to go LFG on Torv* is West Commons. You'll barely have time to get
your LFG flag up before you have a bunch of group requests.

If you don't have your OS and HS keys, get them.

Zones you can expect to hunt at 51: Old Sebilis, Howling Stones,
Chardok, Akheva Ruins, Maiden's Eye. Once you get to 54ish, you'll
also be able to add a bunch of slightly tougher zones to your
repertoire.
