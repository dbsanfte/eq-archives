Two things,

   A> I think ALL characters start out with FISHING, BEG, SENSE HEADING,
BANDAGE skills at first level.

   B> I thought no matter what point you put a point into the skill it will
start out with the value equal to the level you get it at.  So for example, you
get dodge at level 10 and your modifier is (L*5)+5 you start out with 55 in
dodge.  What your saying is that if I waited till level 20 for some reason I
would start out with 105 and not have had to take all those beatings to build
it up.  Somehow I don't think that's how it works.

Maybe it does for some skills, but certainly not for all.  I started Specialize
Conjuration well after my other skills, it still popped in at 1 point if I
recall correctly.
