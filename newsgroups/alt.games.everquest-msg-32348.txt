Not sure if there's an easier way to come up through SK, but since you are
level 19 you can go the following way:

1. Oasis to ? to EC. 
2. EC to WC
3. WC to Kith (don't enter Kith at Night.)
4. Kith to Rivervale (bind)
5. Rivervale to Misty
6. Misty to Runnyeye
7. Runnyeye to Beholder
8. Beholder to EK
9. EK to NK
10. NK to WK
11. WK to QH

The only real danger is avoiding Grimfeather in NK. He flies faster than SOW
so if you see him and he's headed your way, you might not be able to evade
him quick enough.
