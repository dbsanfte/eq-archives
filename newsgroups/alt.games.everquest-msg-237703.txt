From the shadows, the mysterious dstep <dstep@babaloo.net> (if that IS
his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

Actually its a pretty strong argument - not for the existence of God,
but for the non-existence of free will. Everything can be boiled down
to cause/effect at some level.

It is impossible for humans to possibly comprehend a gazillionth of
the information necessary to dispell the illusion of free will,
however, so the net effect might as well be free will. But go back far
enough, and you'll find that everything you do and are was
predetermined by something even if its impossible to say what.

In other words, a hypothetical - suppose a machine were built that was
so powerful it could predict the exact situation of every bit of
matter and energy from the Big Bang - this machine could therefore
predict the outcome of every event after that point through physics.
It would, in fact, actually give the answer to life, the universe, and
everything, because it would know what has happened, is happening, and
will happen.

Of course the only machine capable of doing this would probably be the
universe itself.

God, of course, is utterly unnecessary for any of this, and remains,
as before, an irrelevent human invention with no basis in reality.
