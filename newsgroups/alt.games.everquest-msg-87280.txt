Trooper Shestar is in East Cabilis near one of the entrances to Field
of Bone (if you are in Field of Bone at the entrance facing towards
Cabilis, turn right and enter Cabilis from the right side; Trooper
Shestar will be right down the way when you enter Cabilis).  I believe
you give him five gold pieces and three loose scales from scaled
wolves (the red bead looking things, not the green leafy things--you
can buy them from vendors, too).  He will give you an unfinished coif
and tell him you will need to finish making it yourself.  To do that,
you go to a forge and put the unfinished coif plus three more loose
scales (unstacked)--you don't need water--and hit the combine button
in the forge.  You might want to put a few training points into
smithing but I don't think you need a very high level smithing skill
to do the quest (think it's trivial at 23 or something like that).

There are a couple other newbie Iksar quests to do:

The scorpion pincer quest.  Go to Warlord Zyzz; he's in Field of Bone
in the balcony of the building on your right as you face away from
guards.  Give him four scorpion pincers and you'll get money,
experience and faction boost.

The bone chip quest, which has been discussed a lot here as it's the
only feasible way for non-Iksars to raise faction, since bone chips
stack, while other quest items like scorpion pincers don't.  Go to
Trooper Mozo, one of the guards in Field of Bone by the entrance.
Give him four bone chips and you'll get money, experience and faction
boost.

Sarnak brains.  Go to Warlord Geot in Lake of Ill Omen; he's in the
balcony in one of the buildings on the left as you face away from
guards.  Give him four Sarnak hatchling brains (Sarnak hatchlings are
in LOIO newbie zone) and you'll get money, a fried froglok leg food
item, experience and faction boost.

Watcher torch quest.  Go to Captain Gideen in Warsliks Woods; he's in
the balcony of one of the buildings on your left as you face away from
guards.  Give him three goblin watcher torches (goblin watchers can be
found both in LOIO newbie zone and Warsliks Woods newbie zone) and
you'll get money, aloe bandages, experience and faction boost.
