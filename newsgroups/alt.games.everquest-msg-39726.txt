 And just how are you getting 10-20 more points per hit? STR isn't
linear. Adding 10 more strength to your base stat doesn't mean you're
now hitting for 10 more damage.  For a monk I'd go mostly STA but on a
SK I'd probably split the two with a bias to STR. There are some rather
heavy SK wearable items out there. Why they heck do my IGS weigh 20 damn
pounds? Then again, granite is a bit heavy...

 With those stats I'd probably concentrate more on STA items over STR.
At least get stamina over 100.
