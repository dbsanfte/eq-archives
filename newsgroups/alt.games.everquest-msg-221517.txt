I have a very good friend who plays a druid of the same level as my 
cleric main [56] and he has started a cleric [think she is now to 30ish] 
to get an idea of what a cleric goes through....he says it has helped 
him understand how he can be a healer druid in a grouping. He pretty 
much had always soloed, and has serious respect for people learning to 
interact to make a smooth running group. He does enjoy the cleric, but 
his love will always be his druid....
