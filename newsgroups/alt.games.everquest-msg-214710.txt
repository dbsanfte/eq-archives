Wis won't help you kill anything you should be killing; you shouldn't be killing
things that burn your entire pool anyway.  HP, on the other hand, will do a
better job of helping you survive when you mistakenly get something you
shouldn't; live long enough to run away.

People seem to think a big mana pool will help them kill things faster, but it
won't.  If you have 1000 mana pool, and I have 500 mana pool, and we face a mob
we can kill on 400 mana, then we'll both end up with a dead mob in the same time
period.  I'll be down to 100 mana, you'll have 600 mana in your pool.  Then we
sit down and med, and guess what, it takes me the same amount of time to get
back to full mana that it does you, yes you are down only 40% and I'm down 80%,
but I generate 2% for every 1% you get, because we are each generating the same
10 mana in that percent.

You can indeed kill a second thing immediately, while I'd have to wait for
mana... but when you are done, you now have to sit twice as long to get the mana
back.  In the long run, we'll both spend exactly the same amount of time on our
butts.

I do.  Necros should trade INT for HP; int only gives mana pool, HP gives both
survivability and mana pool, plus HP tend to be cheaper than mana (or int).
Necros should also look very hard into getting HP regen gear, which matters more
to them than it does to shaman, who can regen themselves; necros can get HP back
but have to do so at at least some small risk to themselves, and derive more
benefit from regen gear when really beat up badly; in fact, get enough HP regen
gear and they can run their lower level lich spells and go AFK, not losing any
HP at all, net.
