Just how often does that really happen?  In 1.5 years of playing,
I've had perhaps three total incidents of a too-high-level-for-the-mob
person being "in the way" when I was hoping to hunt/camp something
(not counting the Ancient Cyclops, and there are better ways to solve that
quest bottleneck than the TLC sledgehammer).

And at no time did anyone "fuck my day over".
