It's a stupid question I know but I can't seem to do it! Last friday
,after a download (for the expansion I think) I was sent to a screen
asking me to renew my subscription. Beats me why, I thought they knew to
bill my card every 3 months. The screen asked me for a game card no. I
don't know what they mean by that so I tried the Global account button,
I think that's what it was labelled, which opened my browser to
http://everquest.station.sony.com/
where I was able to do everything but renew my subscription, a simple
renew subscription link would have been nice!
So how do I renew my subscription? Since Sony is still going to bill me
for the Ykesh expansion I think I should be allowed to play EQ.
Thank you for your time.

Cheers Watchman :)
