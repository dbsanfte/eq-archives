Aye it's fun to do.

Many times I come back from the battle fields and dungeons with bag fulls of
stuff I really cannot be bothered to sell for the 50pp - 100pp they maybe
worth and wonder around the like of Orc Hill and newbie zones of Gfay and
Butcher Block and hand out weapons and armour bits to new chars that are
fighting and obviously new players to the game. Then off they go with their
shiny new sword with 60% haste and have a lot of fun.

Also to load same items onto random orcs and bats and like and /ooc what I
have done.

Warms the heart
