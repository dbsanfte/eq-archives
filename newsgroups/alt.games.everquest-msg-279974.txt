UPDATE...

Several of us got together for a "kick-off" meeting where we selected a 
server and laid the groundwork for the guild's guidelines and policies. 
The major points included the following:

1. The primary goal is for everyone to earn their own everything 
wherever possible. If you want a better sword, find out where they drop 
or what quest offers it as a reward and do it yourself. The entire guild 
is behind you and will help whenever possible.

2. NO TWINKING WHATSOEVER, self- or otherwise. No hand-me-downs. No 
gifts. If you didn't hunt or quest for it yourself, don't accept it, not 
even just to turn around and sell. A good example brought up was someone 
hunting in a level-appropriate zone where fine steel weapon drops are 
plentiful, and bringing bags full back to the guild. He should sell them 
all to an NPC vendor rather than handing them out to guildmates. If they 
want one, they should go hunt for one.

3. NO BAZAAR. No purchases or sales are to be made in the Bazaar. 
Consider it the red light district with your mother always watching you 
in her crystal ball. The ONLY exception to this will be cases where 
purchases of necessary NPC-SOLD items can only be made in the Bazaar 
(certain spells and such). This can be discussed in the future as 
unforseen scenarios present themselves.

4. No seeking out/soliciting stat or HP/MANA enhancing buffs from anyone 
outside your group. Utility buffs (SoW or port for possible corpse run, 
etc.) are acceptible, but please try not to go out of your way for them 
if they are not essential to you at the time.

5. Tradekills. This is still a bit of a gray area, but basically we ask 
that no use them to get around any of the basic guild philosophy. If you 
want a crafter to make an item for you, provide them with the 
components. If you are a crafter, you will not be buying/selling in the 
Bazaar. All products produced purely for the purpose of skilling up, 
should either be warehoused or sold to an NPC vendor. The guild bank 
will be used to stockpile tradeskill components, spell research 
components, quest items, etc. We will all contribute and will hopefully 
have what we need when we need it to a reasonable degree. Additionally, 
one hypothetical scenario that was posed was the idea of a 
spider/spiderling silk farming event, whereby we will collectively 
decend upon the Karanas or Commonlands and acquire as much silk as we 
can in a brief period for a needy tailor in the guild. We hope to be a 
community dedicated to the needs of each other in addition to those of 
our own.

6. Money. Not spending it on gear upgrades, you're likely gonna start 
amassing quite a bit of it before very long. It should be meant for 
necessities such as spells, food/drink, training. Beyond that, we advise 
a radical idea....don't worry about spending it. Who says you have to, 
right? Let it collect in your bank. By our way of thinking, you won't 
really need much of it anyway. When it comes time you want to do the Sol 
Ro armor quest, you'll have what you need in the bank with which to do 
it. When you get into the upper levels, treat yourself to a top-speed 
mount. The money will be there. Until then, most everything you need 
should be attainable yourself or with the help of the guild. Money can 
be said to have been the root of all evil in EQ, and we're going to try 
to avoid the pitfalls of there being so much of it around.

These are all meant to be strongly recommended guidelines. I'm not going 
to run around inspecting everyone to see what they're gear looks like to 
ensure no one is cheating. I feel that anyone that has a problem with 
this mindset wouldn't be here in the first place. If you cheat the 
system, you're only cheating yourself. We don't look down upon those who 
choose a different playstyle. We just don't choose that playstyle for 
ourselves. Everything is open for discussion. We will largely be 
responsible for policing ourselves. For example, just during the 
tutorial, we had a group of three of us who all had tasks to kill the 
kobold locksmith and loot his master key, so we needed to kill him three 
times. We killed him once, barely got the key before adds killed us. 
Died trying to kill him the second time, but when we ran back, someone 
else had finished him off and left the key to rot. WE LEFT IT AS WELL. 
We didn't want the key from somone else's kill. We wanted to earn it. I 
hope everyone shares that mentality.

We're up to over 40 people who have informed me of their intent to give 
it a go. Only one opted out after hearing some of the policies detailed. 
Quite a few have already created their character and started through the 
tutorial. The guild app is still in process.

Again, anyone interested in just giving it a try, shoot me an email. :)
