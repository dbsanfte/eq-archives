Yet you chose to compound your bad day by calling me out.   We're your only
family ron, what happened yesterday, you can tell us.  Really we'll stop
laughing at you, honest.

What do I expect from an idiot?
I expect ron to stalk, snipe from behind kill filters and other such goodies
in response to my laughing at his bad day.  I understand you ron.

I'm sure glad you live in California and are too poor to buy a plane ticket.
Because, I'm laughing at you ron.   That makes you really mad doesn't it
ron?

No.  It's a response to you having a bad day, forgetting your Prozac and
going off, like the Usenet kook you are.  No one and I mean no one takes you
seriously.  Everyone is laughing at you ron.

You're a good time ron.  You can hear the giggles can't you ron?

You still converse with me almost daily.  You even called me out for this
one.
 Tell me about that kill file again ron.
*snicker*

What I really find *amusing* is ron green having a bad day.

Flame, ron green, flame.  I'm laughing *at* you, ron, I'm laughing at *you*.
