I ooc/d for a group of 3rd levels to come with me to hunt snow
bunnies... and got a good many favorable responses!  I'd only
been joking, and had to explain to a couple actual newbies why
this wasn't a good idea.  However, if I'd had the time (was about
to log off for RL reasons... cursed RL!)  This would have
been a real ball.

Thing is, many (most, I wager) of the low levels you meet
are not people new to the game, but rather people trying
out a new class, having a bit of a break from their main
character.

We know the game, we know whats up more or less, we
just don't necessarily know our new class all that well.

Rather than the tedium of speed leveling up, going off on
a lark like this can be quite cathartic.

Twink up with a few plat of gear you don't care about
(say store bought cloth, any given loot weapon that
your main was about to dump on a vendor for lack of
real customers)  and a little time spent in a real newbie
garden to level to 3 with some actual skills (don't
bone quest up, you'll only have the 15 spendables, and
none of that will be in offense or defense)

Now go do something that is simply WRONG like
hunting snow bunnies...  I regularly run extreem
lowbies into Crushbone or Blackburrow at third.
Do I get killed?  Yes, I certainly do!  But the yard
trash is actually good hunting at my level, trains can
be dodged, the ground score is (for a lowbie)
awesome, and everyone boggles.  I like to see the
reaction to my /ooc LFG.  Snow bunnies are just
an extension of this... only down side is the annoying
travel time to reach them.  Thing is, though, its
the exact same travel time for my 36 cleric to reach
the ulthorks.  So the -real- down side is that all equipment
will be lost, since a 3rd level body will evaporate in the
time it will take to get back from Antonica.  Even
this can be overcome by getting a bind in Thurgadin
or Kael Drakkar!

Do I reccomend this for everyone?  No, not in the
least.  But it -is- amusing.
