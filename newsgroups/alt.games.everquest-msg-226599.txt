I guess I just don't see the problem, speaking from the perspective of
someone who groups a lot more with knights than warriors. So far, the
warrior changes that people are talking about are a 4%(?) increase in
mitigation and a taunt that should be 'good enough' for exp groups.
Maybe a bit of a DPS increase from these new melee skills but it's too
early to say. 

If that's the extent of the changes I just don't see the problem.
There's gonna be times when you want a pally to tank (if your group
doesn't have a cleric or is light on healing), times that you want an
SK to tank (if your group doesn't have a puller or snare) and times
when you want a warrior to tank (if you're going after the big mobs).
The rest of the time they'll equal enough that most people won't worry
about it.  From what I've seen, my ideal tank for an exp group will
still be an SK <g>.

I don't really do pickup groups but I do often pick up a couple of
people for a LDoN run if I'm grouped with friends. I've never had
anyone bitch about taking a 90% rez.

Exactly. Druid/Paladin/Slower is a pretty efficient basis for a group
no matter where you go.
