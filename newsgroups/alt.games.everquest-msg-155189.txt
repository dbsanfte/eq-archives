The list of traders is alphabetized.  Personally, I am never looking for a
specific trader anyway, so, to me, the issue is moot.  I look for specific
items, or search for items based on slot, race, class, stat affected, focus
effect.  I don't really care who is selling it, just want to find the best
price on the best gear that I can afford.  I actually just ignore all the
chatter going on in the bazaar, as it scrolls by too fast, and I don't
really care who thinks they have the best prices on what items.  I use the
search features to find what I need.
