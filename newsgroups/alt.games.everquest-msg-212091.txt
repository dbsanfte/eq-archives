It's a fixed but long duration.  I've never seen mine fade even after
going AFK for 15 minutes or more.

Well the refresh time is trivial and the ability passes the bona fide
insta-cast test (you can almost always cast it on the run) so I'm
having problems seeing how this situation would come up but if it
does I'd say 99% of the time you'd be ok.
