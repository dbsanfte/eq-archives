New button on your hotkeys, on your most common set:

ASDF

/pause 1,/who all asdf
/pause 1,/who all asdf
/pause 1,/who all asdf
/pause 1,/who all asdf
/who all <your name>

I normally make the button title purple, so I can spot it easily.

Now, when you press this button you'll spam the server with /who all
requests, and it in turn will spam you with results.  This is a temporary
fix; it will usually bring you back from red to yellow or even to green for
5 to 10 seconds.  I tend to spam the button itself 4 or 5 times.  This can
keep me in the green while running or fighting,
