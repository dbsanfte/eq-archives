I upgraded my drivers for my nVida 770 video card, the problem is, they no
longer seem to allow changing resolution of my standard windows view. I play
EQ fine, its just everything else thats buggered, I deleted the file that
was reported as being at fault, and reinstalled windows, unfortunately still
no joy!

anyone have tips on what I should do next?

system:
Dell dimension P500 196mb ram (upgrade on its way)
Riva 770 TNT video card
Windows 98 OS

ps, driver upgrade fixed all my EQ stuff. but now im back in the 80's
desktop wise.

when I try to run the desktop thing from control panel an error occurs in
C:/windows/system/desktop.cpl
