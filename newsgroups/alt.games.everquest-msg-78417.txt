And, furthermore, even a weapon with a worse ratio, that is faster, may very
well also do more damage in the primary hand, due to the added damage
bonuses.  This becomes more of a factor at higher levels, the exact level
when you should move weapons around is highly dependant on the weapons.  I
would point you (Not Ben, you are, I'm sure, quite well aware of the issue
here) to Copelands weapon analyzer, sadly however, the site appears to be
gone.
