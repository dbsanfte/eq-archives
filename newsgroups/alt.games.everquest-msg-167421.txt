Lavastorm also is same way.  I think all extreamly hot zones like that make
you drink more.  I could at one time be sure that Everfrost was same way
with food (colder, so takes more energy/food to keep your body warm due to
the cold slowing you down).

Also doesn't your stamanina bar (that yellow one under HP & MANA) cause you
to consume more food & drink to build it back up?  Or was it that force
feading will force it back up?  Also it would make more sense that if you
ate til you were too full to eat any more, then that would cause your STA to
go down slightly (just like you can get tired after stuffing yourself with a
big meal).
