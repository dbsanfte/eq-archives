I have been playing for about a year now. I have only managed to get my
Shaman up to level 26, and i got a few low lvl "test" chars as well....

I'm playing about 3 hours per week maximum.... maybe up to 5 hours on a
less-busy week, and lousy weather. I have played only 30 minutes since last
saturday, and I do not see another playing oppurtunity till this friday....

I guess that if you are not able to control an addiction, you might as well
not start to play at all. I managed to quit smoking, I managed to keep my
drinking habit under control to only 2 or 3 glasses a week, and it has been
MANY years since i puffed on a mariuana pipe.

I see Everquest as a fun game, that I will play at my own speed, and my own
time. I joined a guild when I was lvl 11, and most of my guildies that were
11 then are now at least 45 or 50..... I do not have a need to get to higher
lvls as fast as possible, I just enjoy gameplay. I think I have been at 26
for almost a month now :)

I agree that some people are completly addicted to this game. Hell, i know a
guy that has a dedicated EQ machine so he can camp stuff for days at a time
if needed.... I do not think i will get THAT involved with the game.

You are in control, and only you..... thats my view on things.

Enjoy your game!

Maarten

p.s. Don't get upset if you lose a 10k item. It is just a game!
