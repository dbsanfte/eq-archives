Said that way, I may agree.  However, and maybe on a "not" so related topic,
how about extending that tolerance part a bit to include the thought
that its actually "Ok" to "not" like someone ? (if that ever comes about)
Thatis something that worries me a bit now-a-days.  We teach tollerance,
acceptance, and non-competiveness to the n-th degree, but we never do so
much as to even "remind" kids/people that yea, its not right to "hate"
someone based on race/color/handicap etc, buts there is also nothing
wrong with hating someone because of natural causes. Really it isn't.
Teach kids to "try" and get along, but if they don't, then don't force
them to chance their personalities to fit, or conform etc.

 And on a issue that I *know* doesn't fit here, but I'm gonna throw
it out anyways. (just lets try and keep it somewhat civil). On the gay
thing, I don't think we should be forced to "like" gay people if one
doesn't want to.  I personally do not have an issue with most gay folks, 
but beings how it is a "behavior", I don't think anyone can reasonabily
be "forced" to accept/reject/like it if they don't want to.  Once we
get into legistating "behaviours", we open up a whole can of worms.
