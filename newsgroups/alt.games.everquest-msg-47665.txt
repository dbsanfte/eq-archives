Another idea, but, then again, I doubt they'll do this since it seems that
"outside" organization isnt their priority, look at all the missing guild
commands that "should" be there, or atleast it would be darn nice if they
were there/available.  No doubt guild features are in your list, so I'll
read on.

As should be, if things are going to weigh 0.3 or 0.1 stones, put that
tenths place in and make it count for something.  Thene again, this might be
due to 0.1 and 0.3 being a "real" number vice the rounded version of
something like 1 or 3 which is an "integer" in the lovely world of
programming.  The way they do it now, they round the sum of all the
inventory which is a "real" number (ie. no decimal points) this real number
is then thrown into a variable to be used for all the other computations
(ie. AGI, DEX, etc., which are also "real" numbers)... when "real" numbers
are used, computations are faster than that of "integer" type.. thus the
probable reason why they use a "real" number for the total weight.

I have seen arrows off of corpses, though these arent technically "thrown."
In other words they aren't independent and require as we all know, a bow.
Though, their reasoning as to why a "thrown" weapon isn't "dropped" is
because of what you just said above, "are lost when thrown."

Hey now! ;p  I won't flame on this, but, I've used this very advantage which
some of MY OWN characters already.  Why if I have 100+k of items on my main
character and another 100+k (this isnt hypothetical btw) in the bank should
I have to endure the first 20 or so levels?  One of two things would happen
if I did this:

1.  I would become agrevated at newbies (not that I havent been in their
shoes, but, just because I'm so used to fighting alongside of more
experienced PC's.  I wouldn't and haven't put them down or insulted them
because of this, because I do remember after-all, we all started somewhere,
which brings me to.....

2.  I would be giving constant recommendations to help the newbies become
better at their game play.  Give suggestions, etc, etc... something I wish I
had readily available to me.  However, some do and have taken offense to it,
despite me giving these recommendations/ideas via /tell.  <shrug>  I always
try to keep the "tone" of my /tells in a non-offensive manner, always in a
constructive sense, but, some are just prone to get pissed off I suppose.

Will probably never happen.  In order to do this, they -could- potentially
run out of disk space or at best cause MAJOR slow down.  Just think of it
this way.  Every character has a bank "file" or "database"... for each slot
its a "record"... grrr.. I have no easy way to explain this... I want to
keep reverting to a programmers aspect.  Lets just say, it is of course
possible... just about any programming "hurdle" is easily overcome or
beaten, though, at times and for some things it would adversely affect other
aspects of the program.

Nice idea.  I don't see why they couldn't add this.  Then again Im not
looking at the source code either ;p  Since things such as a potters wheel,
kiln, oven and forge have a constant number of "slots" if I were to place
say 20 pieces of ore and 10 water flasks into the forge, I would get 10
metal bits (of course assuming I was successful at all of them).  Though,
again, this would create a slow down on server side because of it first
parsing the "ingredients", comparing them to the "recipes", computating
which "product" you actually want, running a random generator (success
factor) on each attempt which is now say, 10 "recipes" server side, then
finally giving the "client" the result.  I doubt they would do this again
because of the "power" it would consume to do all of this server side.

Nah.  PC's still have to convert say 5pp into 50gp's, etc, etc.. for quests
or other reasons.  So, they would still need to keep that code in
here.  -This- idea however could not possibly be "difficult" or "time
consuming" to add.  Of course a user interface would need a make-over,
atleast when accessing the bank, but, its still doable, in fact it should be
doable for SoL.

>

Good idea, but, theres a reason this wasnt added to begin with. :)  Since Im
sure all that "looked at" by EQ Client is a simple boolean variable that is
set to either TRUE or FALSE whenever you are or arent at the bank,
respectively.  In other words, Im willing to bet that this feature is ALWAYS
or rather, hardcoded into the EQ Client (as far as the ability to do this),
but... when you -aren't- in the bank, this variable is set to FALSE, so
therefore the client doesn't allow you to do it.

Though, I am the curious minded so I -do- pay attention and look at all the
"trainers" available on the web and I have yet to see one (I dont use them,
but, instead Im going by their "features" list) that would change this
suspected boolean variable.  Though, this would be stupid now that I think
about it, that is to have since it would go on logs like this:

This_User -not- "logged" into his/her bank account (boolean=FALSE)
This_User converted 500 gp's to 50 pp's

Ding ding ding.. next thing you know.. account is suspended/banned.  Then
again, I've never given thought to the things those trainers out there DO
do.

You ask and people tell you.  Simple enough. :)  There are only 6 to a
group, it isn't -that- tough.. or atleast Im sure that will be their
reasoning.  I personally would probably forget this feature existed if it
did exist.

How can anyone give a quest item to the WRONG NPC is beyond me.  The quests
themselves are for the most part self-explainatory.  But.. lets move on. :)

Hey, if Im a stranger and you hand me 10pp (say $10.00 in RL) I'm not gonna

Even though I have a macro (who doesnt) for a /pet report health, a health
bar WOULD be nice... very nice.  I believe they should alot 12 health bars
in the group "listing" for the possibilty of all group members having a pet.
This too could be implemented into SoL, however, I'm sure they probably have
all they want to do done to the SoL client interface.

The invulnerability would be exploited to all unholy hell, even if they
wouldn't be allowed to attack and/or cast during this period (sorta like DB
that clerics have) they could still be used as a punching bag while others
go to town on a mob.  Oh lord no, dont add this invulnerability, else
everyone will ALWAYS pull to a zone line.  Orrrr... allow invulnerability
AND is TOTALLY invisible to the mobs surrounding that PC AND (to "balance"
it) keep everything invisible to the NPC for those few seconds.  To add a
constant time period after the player "spawns" or "zones" into a new zone
wouldn't fix the problem for a few or many people, they might not have
enough RAM and/or CPU power.  They should instead run a check on the client
that the server more less "pings" the client or atleast checks to see, "hey
can you move your character, or let alone see any of the mobs right now?"
If the client returns with something like "why yes, I can move if I wish and
I can see everything around me just fine."  Then the server would say,
"okay, then Im going to allow sleeper to attack you now, have fun."

;p

How quick?  Remember, their HP's dont change until the attacking person(s)
zones (to eliviate the wondering zoning exploit)  So in essence, put a sow
on me, let me attack the NPC, run out of its seeing/agro/attack range, it
spawns "quickly" back to its spot and I repeat the process.

I believe if anything, they should make the bankers invulnerable and
non-agro.  BUT, make it still that if I try to attack this said banker,
guards or other NPC's on the same faction, attack me in return.

People pulling the banker has got to be the biggest PITA.

Isn't something like this being implemented into SoL?  Or is it just after

How?  In "Windows convention" the text isn't constantly being appended to
the bottom of that already visible.  It's possible, but, it wouldn't work
out the way some would want it because of this constant appending of text.
:(

If you aren't looking at (this is at a RPing stand point of course) your

Meditate (v.) - to focus one's thoughts on

It would be nice dont get me wrong, but, I believe I'm just telling you what

Would be nice and possible I would think.  Its obvious they only have the
mouse scrolling routines enabled for the text box... though, then for mouse
scroll purposes they would need to have code to "determine" the active "box"
or scrollable area/routine, such as foregrounding and backgrouding (for the
lack of better words) is performed in Windows, then allow the scrolling
routine/sub-routing to operate as so.

I would hope not.. just how much actual lands/mobs visible space do you NOT
want?  lol...

I personally do not have "others hits" on among a few other.  It doesnt get
THAT bad for me even during raids, though, not everyone is a speed reader.
;)  It can get to be a PITA at times, but, I personally would not like to
see any more windows than there already are, unless absolutely needed... or
atleast EXTREMELY convenient, such as the 12 group member health bars as
mentioned above.

That would be nice... but, for most the only time you need to know this is
when you are PLing someone or if you give a DS to only one member within the
group.. but, I pretty much know the times on DS's and/or I just have the
tank tell me when he/she needs it again.  I would rather have him/her do
this than for me to have to keep my DS messages on, even -if- they made it a
one-liner.  And yes, I do currently have my DS messages OFF. :)

Now THIS is something I wanted, however... given there a constant number of
zones which anyone can find out all the names of them.. and VI switching to
this non-count showing server selection screen bullshit, I seriously doubt
they will add this feature now... get me?  Sucks, but, I think now more than
ever, they would NOT do this for us.

Progress bars are a decent amount of "overhead" in the wonderful world of
programming.  Even the fastest ones take a bit of overhead to accurately
computate the actual progress of something.  It would be nice, but again, Im
using constructive critisisms and doubt VI would add this.. but, I hope they
prove me wrong on THIS and some other things that I have doubted in this
reply thusfar.

LOL.  PITA isn't is?  hehe.. I hate that as well.   The fact that the line

Though, I think first they should work on ADDING some commands that we type

These are because of the actual "socials" "box" where you first "get" the
social from.  Granted when you place it into your macro's section it can be
longer, but, not while its in your socials.  They could however do a cut
from left to right of the entire string placed in the socials side, but then
people would probably bitch a fit about this too.. not saying you are
bitching a fit about this, but, others wouldn't have put it so, errm, kindly
as you have. :)

Thats why they added the ability awhile ago to "re-arrange" your spell book.
So you could organize it.  Since there is a constant number of "slots" in
everyones spell book, this coding was/is simple, however, to add more icons
for each spell.. welllll.. then they would have to get creative and then
after that they would have to make the icons..  far too much work for them
probably. <grin>

Haha.  Organization of notes in this case goes a LONG way, not to mention a
place you can put these notes so your wife (aherm), parents or whomever will
not MOVE them.  Sigh.

This is another nice feature and I honestly do not see why they dont allow
for a MULTI-TASKING OS to be allowed to MULTI-TASK.  Its a frickin concept
VI, I know this, but.. just imagine it. <grin>

The fact that gets me is, I was using EQW which allowed me to minimize EQ so
I can play BOTH legally owned and operated accounts on one machine, but, now
I find they are banning those using it (in fear that they are using
something they aren't supposed to, or whatever their thought process was
here)... unfortunately, VI doesn't give us REASONS for what they do (after
all you are in "their world now") but it would be frickin nice.. that and
maybe, just maybe have a chance at constructive critisisms to those
"reasons."  Though, that will never happen I'm sure.

I like this idea, alot in fact.  I currently have 5 soul-bound "keys" on me.
Its a bit excessive to have to grab three bags, re-arrange all 5 keys,

Err, yeah I guess.  Though, what -I- would LOVE to see is that the attacking

bastards can cast onto thee, but thee cannot cast upon them, thanks to the

I like it the way it is now.  Can't say I would support this feature.

What happens when you /tell someone what command to use for whatever
feature?  I know they should probably actually take a look at the /help

This would be nice and VERY helpful.  Either:

1.  PC's live with the fact that they cannot explain to someone on how to
use the /loc command as easily as before, or...

2.  Find a different approach at using commands within a command, more less.

Actually.  A zone made just for buying/selling goods, where the banks are
far enough from one another as to not have PC's agroing the bankers of the
wrong faction, or rather opposite or negative faction. :)

Whats this house fee stuff though?  Lord... do you think there should be

Right-click first?

Right-click method takes -far- less "computing power" for the server.  Just
think, say three people are accessing the same merchant at a time (NFP
merchant to the right as you are looking at the bankers is one example),
just think how much the server would have to parse out those items that each
person can or cannot wear.  Just right-click.

Huh?  If something is mezzed, its usually following alongside the PC.  If
something is rooted, its usually there just scratching its head (this is the
only case where it would be nice for some sort of confirmation that its
"available" for an ass kicking), perhaps an actual number/percentage shown
in the health bar of NPC's so that if its not 100% we know its either
recovering or is being attacked.  If its slowed, well, assuming its not
rooted, its usually smacking upon someone.  If its snared (again assuming
its not rooted) its usually walking obviously/visually slow.  If its DoT'd,
well, its health is usually not full, but then again there is where the
actual display of a percentage would come in handy.

Annoying, but, this is just a complaint, since they know it happens and I
don't think it's their intent for it to happen.  Its more of a bug that they
need to correct.  Though, look how long its been so far. :(

Yes, this is coming soon.. or atleast "many" new features.  Actually, this
was just answered by Brad in the latest reponse from him when answering the
"talk smack to Brad."

Good idea.. of course if they make sure to NOT show ALL quests and only
those completed.  Else (exclamation of excitement), huuuu, they would be
"spoiling" the game/quests.

/log on

Run a parser.

Do you realize just how much information would need to be stored so that you
can see this?  Did you mean a list that would only retain this information
for so long, or for the characters entire "life?"  Dunno, hell, they may
have this on file already, who knows.. but, that would be A LOT and I mean A
LOT of information to store.  If they DO already store this
information -somewhere- I am NOT surprised to the constant server crashes
and lack of servers being split that -should- be split, IMO.

I think they will be doing this, FINALLY.  Not sure though, so don't come
back here when SoL is released to flame me. ;p

On this note.. I still think the giants at the FM fort say "Chardok."  Maybe
its just me "wanting" to hear them say this.

Explain the reasons why for this idea please, I for one am interested.
Though, with the recommendation as is, you can still chip away at an undeads
bones with a slashing weapon, etc, etc..

No.  There are times that I would NOT like to root a mob for 190 (engorging)
points of damage while consuming 75 mana.  There are times I like only 60
points of damage while consuming only 60 mana, regardless of the shorter
duration time.  Sometimes I only need a few seconds.  Just organize your
darn spell book. <grin>

Ever been to CoM? Hunt the apparitions.  More voices would be nice, its been
discussed already and I think the response was something about
ability/technology and massive downloading for the users (as if that one is
a real good excuse). <grin>

Reports, feedback and petitons don't get sent.. what game have you been
playing? ;p  /sarcasm off   Im assuming because this would provide too much
load on their email servers.  Just think of the newbie that sends in a bug
report because a spiderling attacked him/her while he/she was /afk. <grin>

Again this was covered in that very same thread that I wish I could find
now.  Good 'ole Absor took the conversation into his hands.

If its recorded it wouldn't be considered a "bug" now would it? :) hehe.. as
for "lost" items... what do you consider "lost?"  How do you record a KSer
specifically?  For all they know or the game, initially (before looking at
attack records) they could have been with you.. not specifically grouped
with you, but then again in raids you often have multiple groups.

For harassers, use /report <harassers_name> as soon as they "harass" you.
These /report's -are- available to GM's.

This -is- recorded. :)

Amen to that!  No, question is, why can they walk THROUGH them. :(

Then they couldn't as easily say, "we told you so."  This probably won't
change.

Huh?  Now this one of ALL the ones I've read of yours, I have to call SILLY.

Or perhaps a new race... lets call it "monkey." ;p

Interesting idea and I think this has been brought up on the EQ boards as

Then in essence you would need yet another trade skill of "lumbering."

Weaver?  That would fall under tailoring as far as I know.

Interesting.

Neat idea.  Make this a "difficult" skill to raise though.

Thats because they WANT you to create more characters to play to higher
levels, over and over again.  They don't make money making leveling
"easier."  Less downtime = Shorter overall subscription = Less money for
them
