My guess, you were running off and hit that point where the mobs start
turning around.  I know I used to dread CR's that occured while running
during the dial-up days as my corpse was usually no where *near* where I
would have loc'd prior to the disco.

Wasn't there some discussion here a bit back about how some Velious and
Kunark mobs will return once you get so far away.  It sure does make for
some interesting kiting with shardwurms when I run off to what I think is a
safe distance to start med'n - and even beat to hell they turn and start
walking away.  First few times that happened I was near certain someone else
was engaging them out of my view.
