This is the change I'm really looking forward to.  Whatever Dennis
and Adam may say, a 55 pre-pop is dramatically easier than a pop 55.
I can't straight up pop mobs without chain summoning, I can solo
pre-pop mobs with just pet heals and nukes - So I'll finally have
somewhere to go solo when my efforts to find a group go for nought.
