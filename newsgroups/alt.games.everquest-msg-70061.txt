Heh. I like FF, but only the earlier ones in the series. Hated VII and
VIII, IX was Ok, haven't played X. IMHO, Square stopped making great
FF games when they dropped Nintendo and went to Sony. They started
stuffing the games full of FMV, static pretty picture backgrounds, and
angsty 'heroes' instead of real actual gameplay, environments you
could interact with, and likable main characters you could actually
connect with. FF used to be a great series, and I eagerly awaited each
new game for the Gameboy and SNES. But the glory days of Final Fantasy
are long over.
