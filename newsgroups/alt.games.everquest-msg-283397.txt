Trying to follow up on a hint that the post 50 fire pets might no longer 
be complete losers, I found the following spell list for the Child of Ro:

Atol's Spectral Shackles
Diamondskin
Draught of Fire
Markar's Clash
Rend
Ice Comet
Conflagration
Enticement of Flame
Force Strike
Instill or Immobilize
Arch Shielding
O'Kiels Flickering Flame

OK, so thats interesting... but if thats the current list, I think 90% 
of groups won't want it used.

Instill or Immobilize?  Root is a deal breaker right there for most 
groups, both because of the obvious, it prevents the mob from running 
(usually snared, so it actually doesn't go anywhere) but also because it 
changes the aggro rules from "highest on hate list" to "closest to the 
mob".  And since a rooting pet is inconsistent at best, you can't even 
use a "rooting" strategy.

I cast the thing and used it for a while, and it didn't seem to cast 
Diamondskin or Arch Shielding or O'Kiels Flickering Flame.  Just its own 
DS (Which I notice isn't on the list)

So maybe this isn't the current spell list?

The other thing I notice is that it looks like I drastically need a pet 
focus item of some sort, the improvement from unfocussed to focussed 
looks to be pretty big, particularly in the hp regen area (which 
admittedly is only really interesting in soloing)  Where can I get 
Summoner's Boon... or should I not bother since hopefully I'll be 66+ 
soon and it... won't do anything?
