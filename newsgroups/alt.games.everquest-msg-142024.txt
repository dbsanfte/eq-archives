    A "real raid" still isn't possible without a cleric, Oh Experienced
Raider. How many people do you know that want to go kill stuff in high-risk
environments knowing that their res is coming from a paladin? Or that the
healers they count on to save them are leather-clad, no-DA-or-DB wanna-be's
that will crumple after the first heal lands and they get all the extra love
from untanked/unmezzed mobs?
