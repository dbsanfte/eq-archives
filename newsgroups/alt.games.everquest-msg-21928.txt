Two peices of advice:

Stay away from Lake of Ill Omen.
Stay away from Highpass Hold.

Both are overcrowded contests for spawns.  It's simply not worth the
effort when there are so many other uncrowded, unhunted, great areas
to play in.

South Karana has become good again.  Hang around the Centaurs and/or
Aviaks, both camps drop bronze weaps, gems, and the occasional
Ringmail armor.  The coin isn't terribly bad either.  As you move up
into your low/mid 20's, you can start joning Spitpaw spire groups, or
go into Paw itself.  You'll get minor sellable goods (Splitpaw armor
crap), and the motherload of low level hunting... Fine Steel weapons.
This area can take you into your low 30's easily.

Cazic Thule is good, but it's now a Bring Your Own Group affair.
Simply not many people hunting here.  Which is good, as it means
you'll have plenty of spawns to yourself, and a ton of Fine Steel
drops.  

Najena was good at this level.  With a good group, you can take out
the Bonecracker/Ogre rooms, both of which can drop some decent loot.
