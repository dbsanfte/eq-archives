When they did the big DirectX patch last fall it screwed up
the sound big time. I've been complaining vociferously ever
since then.
 
 As it is now for me I cannot hear the fight I'm standing right
smack dab in the middle of but I can hear the sound of the waves 
from the lake in LIO at the Mill. Thats right, I can hear the water 
all the way over at the mill. But I cannot hear the thing I'm fighting.
 
 I really wish Verant would fix it, it's incredibly annoying.
