You don't need a GM.  The *rules* say that if the mob is not engaged, you
can take it.  You'd only need a GM if the other guy was trying to kill-steal
the mob from you after you engaged it.

That's the official rule, anyway.  However, you have to consider unofficial
rules, too.  *WHY* is the other guy killing all these guards?  Do they drop
really good loot?  Or do they drop some rare quest item that is needed for a
high level quest?  There are some quests where a high level person needs to
kill something that gives no XP many times to get their quest item.  If this
is the case, there *may* be a convention on your server that all the guards
are one camp.  If so, that would just be a player-made rule, and you can
freely ignore it, *but* that can come back to haunt you later.  (I could
especially see such a convention developing for a place like Paineel, which
is (or was, at least, before the Nexus) rather isolated, and requires a key
or help to get into).

What I would do in such a case is find out what they guy is doing there.  If
it is a quest, I'd tell him I want to kill the guards for XP, and he can
have the quest item if/when it drops.
