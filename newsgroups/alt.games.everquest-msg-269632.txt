I chose a scribe as a trade profession and am currently level 15. I
was just browsing the scrolls for sale and see truckloads of people
selling app3 scrolls for 3sp.

How can they do this ? In order to scribe an app3 scroll I need to buy
a maple quill which go for 5sp and a piece of caliun paper at 6sp.
That's 11sp before you even take into account harvesting materials for
the ink and time spent making the scrolls.

You'd have to be charging 15-20sp before it became worthwhile, yet
people are selling them for 3sp ?

Cheers,
