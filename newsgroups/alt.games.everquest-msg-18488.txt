   Twenty plat is more the norm on Drinal.  Might not make a difference
to 
the higher end characters, but would to someone who might actually want
the
vellium.  
    Last week my ranger was looking a vellium 2 handed sword.  Saw
someone 
/auction that they had one.  Told them that I would pay 20 plat for it.  
They told back that they were hoping to get 60.  Uh huh.  Good luck with
that, then.
   I dunno if Drinal just has as screwed up economy, or some screwed up
would-be merchants.
