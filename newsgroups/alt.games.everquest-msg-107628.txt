Says who? Obviously not Verant. Obviously not the majority of other CS
reps out there. If you have such a bitch about it, the door's over
there. Protest with your wallet and quit making an ass of yourself.

Hey, guess what? Maybe the reason behind the "old trick" is the
same... The guide answering the petition had to locate what zone the
player is in, teleport to the zone, locate the player, and teleport to
that player... Other problems, sometimes they need to referrence the
other guides present.
