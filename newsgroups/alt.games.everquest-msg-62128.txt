This just in from Absor:

"We've got a new version of the DLL available on the Test server. Those
of you trying out the new DX8 implementation should patch from Test
again to get the new DLL.
Alan"

Oh, and the other notice from last night was that TestEverquest.exe is
now "obsolete". You can just use the standard EQ log-in, select
"Advanced" and go to the test server from there.
