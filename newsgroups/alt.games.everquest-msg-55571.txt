30 Druid and 10 necro on Tarew Marr, Used to have a 30 warrior too but he
got deleted in an unfortunate accident.  Also played a paladin to 13, a
shaman to 11, a monk to 8, a cleric to 7, wizard to 5 and SK to 4  =P  but I
got tired of all of them and deleted them, god trolls take a long time to
level.
