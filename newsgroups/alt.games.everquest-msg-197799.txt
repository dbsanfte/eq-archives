Actually, as far as I'm concerned, being consistent with EQ1 _is_ the only
reason. :)  I prefer the black Drow of forgotten realms, or the dark-brown
dark elves of a lot of Larry Elmore art.  Blue isn't my thing.

But they are blue on Norrath.  So I want them blue in EQ2.

It'd be like giving dark tans to High Elves.  Consistency, damnit! :)

/agree

And hence the answer for why they aren't white skinned.  :(  Realism,
bah!  More important to look cool.

BTW, does anyone know what came first...the first fantasy concept art for
a Dark Elf, or Storm from X-Men?  I tend to think of her as the "original"
dark elf, but that might be because back in my early D&D days I remember
there being Storm in my friends comic books, but the DM never brought up
dark elves, ever.

I believe they are.  If you go to teh "media" link, there are further
in-game screenshots that look like those two.

They say they won't age over time, though certain spells will age you
temporarily.  And so far they haven't said outright that customization is
as thorough as SWG, but damnit...if they did it there, they can do it for
EQ2!
