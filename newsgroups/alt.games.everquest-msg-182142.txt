Well...

As someone watching from the sidelines - someone who generally enjoys
reading the posts of both Jazz and James - I'd like to make the following
observation, which I hope is neutral:

It seems to me pretty clear that the other guilds had reached an agreement
with LC.  Call the agreement BS, call it an attempt to keep the other guild
down, call it what you will - it was an agreement the officers of LC had
with the officers of the other guilds.  The other guilds broke the
agreement, and LC is upset about it and expressed their dismay.  I tend to
sympathize with that.

If your guild makes an agreement - no matter how unfair you think the
agreement is - then breaks it, I don't think that speaks very highly for
your guild.

I guess what happened is a warning to us all: don't make agreements of this
nature in a highly competitive environment and expect people to keep them.
There's just simply no way to enforce it.

Just my thoughts - make of it what you will.  =)
