Hello All,

Was a level 4 High-Elf Paladin in Falwithe, when a high level druid
offered help to increase experience points. Was transported and bound to
a new area. Problem is that druid then took a powder leaving me in a
zone where I last about .001 seconds at best. Is there a kind soul who
would transport me back to Falwithe and bind me there? I know it's
laughable, but these things happen when you trust someone!
