it's slower.  it draws slower, and the mouse moves slower.  i suppose
this is probably caused by the higher res.  i'll try it at 640x480
and see what happens.

i don't like the way the various sub-windows obscure the main
viewport.  yes, i know they're mostly transparent, but i still don't
like it.  is there a way to reduce the size of the main viewport,
to allow room to place the sub-windows where they won't obscure
anything?

i don't like the new spell gems and buff symbols.  i was used to
the old ones.  is there an option to use the old ones?

i like that the new spellbook has eight slots per page instead of
five, but it does mean that i'll have to rearrange all my spells.
so be it.  are there any new commands for swapping spell slots in
the spellbook?  like, say, moving all spells on page 1 to page 30?
how about memming an entire page at once?

is there a comprehensive reference somewhere, that lists all the things
you can cuztomize on the new UI?
