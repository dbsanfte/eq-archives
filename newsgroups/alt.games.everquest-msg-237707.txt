Ok I've been looking at the reward for the Magician Epic, and it is
evidently a spell, which summons an orb, which can be used to summon a
pet.

I'm really curious to know how this pet stacks up to pets later in
game.
I know that at 52 Magicians get a pet called Voceration of Fire or
something like that.  That is supposed to be this bad ass, Ice Giant
thrashing, Fire Elemental with a bunch of self buffs and what not.
There is also Monster Summoning 2 which will evidently summon the
biggest badest creature in the zone, to tear up whatever ails you,
without the problems that enchanters get of having the charm spell
wear off, and the monster promptly eating the master.

So I guess my question is this, other than the satisfaction that one
almost always gets from camping "Uber rare spawn #99, A Slightly
Larger Gnoll Pup", for the 203rd time and having him FINALLY drop,
"Uber Rare Item #1356, Kirstens Completely Unrelated Key to Finally
Completing your Quest", just so you can finally say "I GOT MY EPIC". 
IS there any point to bothering with the epic?

Specifically the magician epic.  I mean if it is basically only a pet
spell, and a lvl 46 pet spell at that, is there something else special
about this pet, that maybe I should be aware of?
