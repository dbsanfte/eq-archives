I thought he was saying that the fact that you were "bitching" meant that your
character must be female.  Of course, if thats the case, you could equally say it
implies your character was not only female, but in wolf form at the time; druid,
ranger, buffed by one of the above, or using a high level enchanter illusion
perhaps?   At any rate, that would account for the use of the word Bitch in the
reply.

It wouldn't make much sense that way, either, however.
