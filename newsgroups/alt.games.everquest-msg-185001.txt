You mean the little 'indestructible keyboards'? that roll up and are made
entirely of soft plastic?

They are not great... the keys are insensitive, and they are hard to use
because they have no slope (I have a wedge of wood to put mine on). I mainly
use mine when I 'rough it', specifically on Field Day... I can put the
computer well out of the way and use the keyboard and not worry about people
spilling stuff on it or it getting wet from the rain...

you'd think it would be ok, sitting next to several thousand $ worth of ham
gear, but I lose more keyboards that way

I wouldn't want to use one every day though.

oh, they also can tear...
