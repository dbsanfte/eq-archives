Isn't the EQ RNG notoriously streaky? streaky = not random.

Should be easy enough to tell. Generate a string of results and check the
correlation between result n and n+1. If the correlation is positive the
RNG is streaky.

Actually there are computer RNGs that are "truly random" - they use some
form of white noise or truly random data to build an "entropy pool".
This doesn't produce anything near the amount of random data that a game
like EQ needs, however.

My own observations support the "streaky" idea, but I don't have solid
numbers to back it up. For example, repeatedly /randoming until I get a
streak of three numbers 700+ when tradeskilling seems to improve my
success rate. That may be my imagination however.
