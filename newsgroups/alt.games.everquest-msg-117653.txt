I've been away from EQ for a bit but I return to read the disturbing news of
the escalated tension in Freeport.Also other things have been
happening.Lately my 3 lev rogue is killing orc pawns carrying ore (at least
2 out of 3 are)....
Months ago orc weapon smiths were showing up, they sometimes were carrying
special short swords.....
Are the orcs mass producing weapons for someone.
If they are then there in full swing.But this is probably old news.
