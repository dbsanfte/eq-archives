For me, at least, the fear of having no fallback was covered when they 
added the corpse rot guys. It pretty much removed all real fear. Worst 
case I'd lose a character for a week. I stopped worrying about being 
stuck in dungeons (or places like PoF, PoH) at that time, and haven't 
looked back.

Then with DoN they added corpse summoners, and allowed you to get a 
rez... which made dungeon wipes irrlevant, imo.

In my experience at least, more often than not when you 'discover' that 
you're stuck in a dungeon, you won't have the luxury of camping out and 
waiting six hours. You'd be looking at the "Loading. Please Wait...." 
thinking omg omg omg omg.. I'm f*****d!!  

Its the deep dungeon corpse recovery that made one way dungeons scary, 
not the inability to get out. Getting out has always been easy... 
getting your stuff out was the challenge. And we've had solutions to 
that for quite a while now.

The new feature is handy, to be sure, but its not a big deal in my 
books.
