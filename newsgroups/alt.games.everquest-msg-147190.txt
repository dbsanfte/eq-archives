You can also see if Jakiss and Tarre are online, and we can try grouping. If
ye can't stand hanging out with us afterwards, I can understand. But yer
certainly welcome to try it once. =P We're both 54, and hanging out in
Skyfire lately, fearkiting.

This is sort of what Jak and I have done. He does a quad, I run cleanup
squad (take the fifth on a pull if there is one, have the pet kill the
runners, etc). Then while he meds, I go single pull until he's full mana.
Sometimes he snares or roots for me. I'm usually not down enough on mana to
where I can't help bail him out. The only time we have trouble is when he
snares himself. Which, thank goodness, is pretty darn rare. The true benefit
of this is that you *always* have something to do. No downtime for you! Who
cares if you're splitting XP with yourself- you are still actively playing
the whole time, instead of, say... reading... while you wait to med back to
full or heal up.
