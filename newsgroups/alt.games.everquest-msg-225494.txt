The top north-east trial basement has a safe spot on the right wall
after you enter. Check a map (either in game or at eqmaps.com) it should
be obvious where I mean. There's two other trial basements that also
have safe areas but it's harder to describe where they are. They should
be fairly obvious on a map anyway. Don't pull from outside areas during
a changing of the guard. The other 2 ground level halls will have 1 or 2
locals if I remember right, so need to be broken and timed unlike the
one you were in which has a safe hall.
