     Well, I would never presume to claim to know the full capabilities
of any class, not even my own (always open to learning something new). 
And I can certainly see situations where the wizard might do best by
standing before the mob is half gone.  Also, all of my experience has
been in the lower game so far.  Teapray is my highest level character
ever, and she's not exactly what one might call uber.  But when the
wizard goes full burn as soon as the puller gets the prey within range,
then gets agro, then dies despite the efforts of everyone in the party
to keep him or her alive, then I have to think that wizard was doing
something wrong.
   But I will grant you that bossy group leaders who think they know
more than they do are a bane, also.
