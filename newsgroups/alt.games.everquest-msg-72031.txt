As near as I can tell, that difference, to *you*, is whether my opinion is
positive or negative.  As soon as my opinion is negative, I'm whining.

And since to you a negative opinion is by definition whining, I guess I'm
never going to stop whining.  Until the world is perfect, I will always have
negative opinions about aspects of it.
