    I <3 officer reward, because it mitigates the stupidity of your

    A points system is not license for stupidity, no matter how much some
points proponents may think it is. Remember the underlying arguement in
favour of points? By giving items to people who play more, you maximally
improve the capabilities of the guild. Many points systems have checks and
balances incorporated in them, like class limits on specific items, for just
that reason. If someone, by looting an item, actually hurts himself, he is
not improving the capabilities of the guild.


http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=29250.topic
is a thread on The Safehouse that shows quite nicely how different people
view points systems. It's sort of neat to see how many people see it as a
tool to strengthen a guild, and how many see it as an absolute.

    Furious Bash seems to trigger when spells are cast. Should be
interesting to see his reaction after he first tries to Snare with the thing
equipped, or tries nuking while using archery.

    The dumbest loot decision I've heard of regarding rangers is a ranger
that was pissed because the Quarm item he was awarded rotted when another
moron triggered the Zebuxoruk script early. The item that rotted? Spool of
Woven Time, a Fury of Solusek/Spiritual Fury item... for ranged slot. Why
anyone would ask for a "best in game" item that is situational at best to
them, and even then only of use for the nuke focus (the ranger had a Bow of
the Tempest), is totally beyond me, as is the reasoning of the loot council
that would make such an award.
