> good to meet you!

Thanks, and you.

> I see the guild name around, but not your name much.

Nice that the Guild is becoming more visible ;) It has been around a long
time, but members come and go.

I am UK-based so it depends on your time zone. The problem I have is that
there are virtually no pickup raids that are UK-friendly times, and the ones
that are are usually over subscribed (last Hate raid I tried had 70+ people
turn up and only 36 selected ....). Coupled with only a few of my level in
the Guild, and not knowing many people outside the Guild, I don't do a great
deal at the moment.
