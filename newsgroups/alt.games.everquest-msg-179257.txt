Another issue with onboard graphics cards is that many of the motherboards
with on board graphics do not have a seperate AGP slot to add a Graphics
card to. Therefore if you want/need to upgrade your Graphics card you need
to find a PCI video card. It's hard to impossible to find PCI versions of
the high end video cards. So if you do buy a computer with onboard video, at
least make sure it has an available AGP slot for upgrading.
