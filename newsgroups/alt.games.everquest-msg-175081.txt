What?  No Enchanter?  Pity they left out the most dangerous class
of Froggie I've encountered.

Oh, isn't that sweet.  So much for the "RP rationalizers" who've been
telling us there was nothing wrong (from an RP perspective) with a
Paladin camping the Shin Lord for Ghoulbane.  It never was an act of
valor (M. Marr), or love (E. Marr), or a defense of life (R. Nife),
nor particularly justifiable in the context of Tunare (murdering a
Frogluk Paladin beneath the swamp defends nature how?), nor Karana
(show kindness to travellers, but abandon the open air of your patron
lord so that you can slaughter some Paladin who never harmed you, for
your own personal gain?).  Brell's followers are such a fractious
assortment of jerks, warring with hateful enthusiasm on one another,
many of them greedy well beyond a fault, that it's hard to quarrel
with a_random_dwarf01 doing it (it's hardly in keeping with many of
the personas I've seen Dwarf RPers take on tho).  Never looked at
Prexus, so maybe the Erudite rationalizers weren't so full of shit
as the Humans/Elves/HalfElves.
