Nice try. 

I have more knowledge of "how things work" than the average American. 
But given the literacy rate that's not even saying that much.

Seriously though... you think your somehow magically more in touch with 
what goes on just because you 'live' there. Has the internet taught you 
nothing? The average american finds out whats going on in the USA from 
CNN etc the same as the rest of the world. Meaning the average american 
has no 'special insider information' about government policy, social and 
economic problems, except at the very insignificant community level.

If you said I have no perspective on what your mayor has done in your 
hometown of spitball usa you'd be right. But we're likely both equally 
far removed from the whitehouse to be standing on level ground when 
assessing what goes on there.

You mean if I lived 4 miles to the south? Yeah, my perspective would be 
a whole lot different then.

Its good to see your heart is in the right place at least.
