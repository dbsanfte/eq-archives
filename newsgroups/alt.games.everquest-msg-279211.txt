When I am looking for temp in the PoK and I can see there are plenty of high
level clerics around and not one is responding, I might get a little
perturbed (human nature, dontcha know).  However, I understand there are
reasons s/he may not want to buff at that moment.  It has never occurred to
me to send a /tell to a cleric and pester him/her for temp (in PoK or
elsewhere).  I simply adjust my strategy (play without temp, bring in a
different toon, etc.) and go on with my day.  And you know what?  Quite
often a cleric will send me a /tell to come get buffed even though s/he is
not open for business.

Simple courtesy, acknowledged or not, goes a long way.
