assuming you havent used any points yet.....i would......

put 3 in run speed (thats the first 3 points i would do reguardless of
class, even if you can sow)
put 3 in natural regen
move to the arch skills and....
put 3 in natural durability
the last 3 would be a hard choice...
put 3 in....combat stability OR combat agility (the one i didnt do i would
put next on list, and after that combat fury)

- the reason i put agility/stability/durability above combat fury is because
warriors need all the hp/ac they can get, damage is important to taunt
though, so that would be next on my list after what i listed above.
