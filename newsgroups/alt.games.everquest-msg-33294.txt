Did you buy the game used from someone else ?
[ perhaps returned to the store you pirchased it
from ?]

It almost sounds like a previous owner had paid
by a time card. [ a time card is a pre-paid plan
allowing a person to pay for a certain amount of 
time at their local store, then use a code number 
given to them to then access the game , just in 
case you weren't familiar with the term ].

Were you trying to go to ' create account ' or ' change account ' ?
I would say go to ' change account ' and see what happens.
It might flip you from there to changing your billing info.

The problem shouldn't have anything to do with the machine.
