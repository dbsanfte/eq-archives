I hate beggers! When I first started my barbarian beastlord, I grouped with
a couple of other low level folks. They were already starting to annoy me
because they were grabbing all the loot before the body hit the ground. When
one of them started going up to higher level characters and begging, that
was the final straw. I disbanded from them right away. I didn't want to be
associated with that.

I've found people are usually more helpful on their own without being asked.
When I was a level 2 or 3, I was sitting at the ramp regaining hp and a
couple of people came by and gave me money and things like bags or beer.
Nothing major, just nice things to help you get going. That's the way it
should be. It also makes you want to do the same for others. While I was
building up my tailoring skills by making tattered leather stuff, I would
give the pieces to low level characters instead of selling them to the
merchants.

It's all about karma.
