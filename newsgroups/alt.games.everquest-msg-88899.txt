    I was grouped once and I couldn't hear anything the rogue was saying.
Checked ignore, he was there. Had no idea why, though, so I took him off. He
then proceded to pull the entire castle in Velk's (we were a floor group),
and then after he'd pulled them started asking me to heal him before they
got there. He went back on ignore after I ressed everyone he killed and
disbanded.
