That's the north wall, actually.  There is also a new goblin camp
along the south wall.  As well as:

a camp of "shadowed assassins" who look like DEs in the southeast
corner (outside the wall);  2 camps of diseased rats and halfling
skeletons flanking the Rivervale entrance, one of which has a
scarecrow that I could not target; a named NPC in the southeast
corner (inside the wall) who has a pair of pet wolves; an abundance
of newly named mobs such as "thicket rat" and "yellow jacket" etc.
There may well be more stuff that I overlooked.

Best news:  a pair of fletching merchants in Rivervale!  Now I can
forget venturing into Kithicor when I need supplies in that part of
the world.  ;-)
