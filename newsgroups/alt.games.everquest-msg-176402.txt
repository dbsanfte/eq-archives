If you are charm soloing you die regularly with an enchanter.  Period. 
There may be areas where this doesn't happen but then you usually aren't
soloing to potential.  Enchanter charm soloing is extremely dangerous. 
One spot of lag, one slip up, one resist at the wrong point and you're
dead before you can type wtf!  It isn't that adrenelin pumping because
most of the time you are sitting there watching the xp roll in, then
maybe you take a sip of your Dr. Pepper * Suprise * you are dead in
about 5 seconds as your root broke just as charm did, and your flux was
resisted, and you are stunned and quadded by two mobs, you have 2
seconds left of life as you have to quickly decide weather to try to get
off gate, another stun, or hope you can outrun their next attack if you
have room, if you hesitate you are dead, if you choose wrong you are
dead, even if you choose right, you are still probably dead.  Sound
fun?  Think charming still needs to be nerfed?  If you have an on call
96% rez you are going to outxp any other class... If you don't you might
find the levels slipping by - in reverse.

> Bards? Controlled Panic? Our opinions differ.

Just quoting what I've heard one bard describe swarm kiting as.

> Shaman?  Depends on who is playing the avatar.

I was able to solo reds up to when I quit my shaman at 36 pre kunark. 
You can say that about any class, pointless.

> Necromancers? I like the "sitting back in a lawn chair and watching the xp
> roll in" quote.

As I've heard necros describe it.  I like it too.  I find it too booring
though.  If they put in alot more undead I might like it, being able to
charm, fear & snare, while getting mana at an obscene rate.   Really
Druids Necros and Shaman (although very late) all have charming
abilities albeit limited to mob types, but I rarely see them use it, if
they did (or could find the are to do so) they would easily outstrip
enchanters.

Not yet, see what I mean though?

Why I say they are king of the quad after 34 ( or whenever they get
their snare) they can do more damage efficiently than a druid to
multiple mobs.

Then there's Beastlords, haven't heard them mentioned much but from what
I've seen they are supreme Soloers as well.

Also haven't heard Mages mentioned much I'm not sure where they fall for
soloing, but I think they must be better than necros as they seem to
solo even more and seem to know less what to do when they get into a
group.

My favorite.
