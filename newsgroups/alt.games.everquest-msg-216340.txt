*TWO* quests we tried to go on were bugged at the entrance last night / Tholuxe
Paells.

We've had terrible luck getting the quest we want, or at least getting one we
didn't think sucked.  (They should give you a choice so you can just say *mass
kill* if that's what you want).  
That said I've been on 3 collections with my level 30s and we've completed
every one with time to spare and had extras by the time we were booted.  We've
been on 2 collections with my level 57 and failed both.  And we worked alot
harder on the 57 missions.
(I think the guy who suggested it was a twinkage factor could be right on
target there....)
