Actually, "no one" is right.  Almost every class can solo 12-16 with about
the same ease/difficulty.   The only differences are the particular tactics.

As for charming you forgot to mention the part where you lose at least a
bubble of health each time you have to recharm the critter (which you'll
have to do at least once/fight...ok, ok, in 25% of fights you don't have to
recharm...I'd hate to be accused of inaccuracy).

I never use it unless there's no other choice.  That would include the
puller pulling two tough critters, neither of which can be mezzed.  If I'm
charming my CHA is 170+  (I CAN get it up to 200+ but I usually don't have
time to mem charm AND find my CHA stat stuff, as opposed to my HP or INT
stuff).

Charm is highly overrated.
