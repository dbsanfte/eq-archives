Did they change the pathing code? I was in Kurns recently (with my
graphics error invisible shaman pet). And it completely lost me whenever
I was just a few footsteps off it .. and I mean lost. Nowhere to be seen.
I was used to very bad pathing in kurns earlier, but it somehow worked when
I kept standing around at a few key points to get my pet through. But
now pathing got impossible .. I lose the pet instantly, whatever I do ...
any ideas?
