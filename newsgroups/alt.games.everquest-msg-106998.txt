And note that there's a difference between not thinking druids need
improvement (I think we could use a *little* improvement, but we don't
*need* any), and between people shouting that druids should just run
off and solo and play a different class if they want to raid.

We already have one (f/c buffs). Had two, but got to share group regen
with some other classes.

Warriors get better and better weapons all the time, and clerics got
the recent nuke upgrade, remember? :p
Damnit, it's not like 'more useful on raids' would mean a new ability
or something completely unbalancing. As far as I am concerned, we're
talking about a small tweak here, like having a level 60 heal that
actually was more useful than the level 55 heal. We are NOT talking
about something like giving druids CH even though I think I've seen
dozens of people shouting that that's what is being asked for.

Do you start campaigning for soloable warriors and clerics whenever a
non-druid class wants some tweaking? No? Didn't think so.
