The UI map mods are 110% legit. They do absolutely nothing that's
forbidden in the EULA. The one problem with them is that you have to
load ALL the image files into memory as you log in, which not only slows
down initial loading immensely, but it'll probably slow down all but the
strongest systems across the board.

The 'you are here' map hack type things however are probably illegal, as
there's no current way of using the UI mod tools to implement /loc

I started using the XML files to make a rudimentary map viewing system,
but once I realised how the UI handled the graphic files, decided it
wasn't worth the system degradation. I wouldn't have the first clue on
how to make an external hack to show maps with current position.
