    Sorry to follow up the same post twice, but I was just thinking. You
know what would be nice? A section on the EQLive website where all bugs that
are known and being investigated are listed. They'd have to skip mentioning
the security or game integrity-related ones, of course (SAFE SPOT IN VEKSAR
BEING FIXED, USE IT WHILE YOU CAN!!!!), but it would be useful for players
to see what is and isn't being looked at.
