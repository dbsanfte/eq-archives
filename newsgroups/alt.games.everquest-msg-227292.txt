Well the points leader only stays the points leader until they start
spending points.  If your Guild is beyond BoT minis (say) you're going
to have a hardcode with high percentage attendance so buying an item
usually drops you ten or fifteen places on the 'ladder'.   We placed a
limit of one item per mob to stop people hoovering Aten loot for
example.

Speaking of Aten soooooo many high points people were saving for her
neck they passed on all manner of lovely stuff on the way there.
Madness.

In practice we found that unless the item was godly if it was priced
too highly it would rot so I don't *think* most people would have got
themselves into horrendous drama causing bidding wars.

Having said that the people that two and three boxed each other to
fuck people over for flags and points most certainly would have.
Kinda hard to attend more raids than someone who had given their
password out to half a dozen people so they could be 'present' no
matter what.

We let people go as negative as they wanted so as long as someone was
willing to pay the points for it nothing rotted.  Take Dain for
example; people stopped REALLY wanting the head as we farmed the ever
living hell out of him for a while so folks were told if they didn't
buy the head next time we'd no longer kill Dain.

We did have the usual stuff rot - the food and water AoE stuff in VT,
many many Knight weapons, the utter shite from the Rhags and assorted
tat from mobs we should have stopped killing months before but had ONE
item on their drop table people wanted.
