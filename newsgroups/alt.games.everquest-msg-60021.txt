I have traveled through NFP a lot with my DEF necro once my Knights of Truth
faction was beyond KOS and never had problems with this guy (I could even
walk up to him, he was dubiously)....
Untilll.... I decided to become friends with the Priests of Marr:
I turned in 34 stacks of milk in WC, and then he came out of his house
to bugger me.... I was level 39 at the time, so he didn't really hit me bad,
I didn't have a pet though, so I decided to just run off when he resisted my
first root. It was not before then that I discovered he was a rogue...
Ugly backstab :( But I made it out and came back for payback time...
Kinda fun to kill this ugly little freak....
