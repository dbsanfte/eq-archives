  Now I can certainly swing the extra $3 a month, though it would be nice
for ADVANCE WARNING on price increases on any type of subscription service.
It's only common courtesy, and VI did indeed drop the ball on their
customers needs with this one.
  I guess they figure that after the initial shock of "Oh my God!  $40/month
for Legends" wore off and some people jumped on the bandwagon, An increase
of $3/month would pale in comparison.
I figure they were expecting to shore up some serious $$ from Legends, and
from what I've been hearing it's not overly successful.  So it's time to
shore up some more cash "because of increased costs of maintenance blah
blah" when I just read an interview with a VI honcho saying their
subscription numbers are higher than ever?
One last thing.  I've never joined the "what EQ is stealing from DAoC"
group, because I've never cared for what the latters' product had to offer.
Especially the fact that it WAS slightly more expensive ($12.95/month)

So all I can see that EQ did actually borrow from DAoC was it's subscription
price...
Definitely a "When in Rome" corporate response from VI/Sony.

Oh well.  The new patch evidently wasn't free, hehe.  I guess I'll have to
sell my summer estate in the Hamptons.

Off to kill some gypsies in Mistmoore,
SEAN...
