I agree with the original post. I too have become very frustrated with EQ. I am
a lvl 53 Warrior and i cant find a group as well. Every decent dungeon i goto
(Seb/Velks) has a bunch of lvl 60 uber people farming the good loot/camps
simply because they can. I feel all lvl 60 people should be banished to SoL and
tough it out there. Sure who wouldnt enjoy grouping with LvL60 chars. They make
the killing a whole lot easier.
