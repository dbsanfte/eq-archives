I think half the problem is that we have found a niche market: stupid
people. There are cheaper ISP's around, and there are better performing
ISP's, but we offer the best tech support in town. Consequently all the
clued people move on but all the clueless become dependant. It is like a
huge pool on concentrated stupidity which is getting more concentrated every
day : /

But a lot of them sadly are thinking to the best of their ability. Your just
in the Denial Stage: "a human being cannot possibly be this stupid". Ahh the
Denial Stage, how sweet it was... much more fun then the later Bitter Hatred
of Humanity Stage.

Explaining what an icon is: 10 minutes.
Explaining what the desktop is: 15 minutes.
Trying to explain why IE can't send email: Timeless.

Yes - it is very rude of them indeed. Eventually they get the picture, but
invariably they attmept to mistakenly rectify the situation by telling the
children to be quiet and not by apologising for breeding and promising to
get sterilized asap...

But snapping is so much more fun. I am developing all these invaluable
skills playing GTA3, it would be such a shame to leave them underutilised...
