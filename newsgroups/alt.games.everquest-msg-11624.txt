ALL (every single one) of my custom hotkeys have /doability 1 (sense
heading) in them until SH is semi-reliable.  I still leave it in my /loc
social though...that only makes sense.

Heck, for my rogue I created a custom hotkey for Hide & Sneak that included
that skill + /doability 1.  She's finally almost maxed with SH so I've gone
back to the regular buttons (there's a disadvantage to making a custom Hide
& Sneak button.

Although MANY people would disagree I think that Sense Heading is an
extremely important skill to get above 50 or so.   I mean, I do /loc's fine
but SH is easier for me to read.
