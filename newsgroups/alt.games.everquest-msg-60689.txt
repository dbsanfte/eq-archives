 I was wondering about what the shamans role plays like in a group in later
lvls. I know in the 30's is buffer, backup heals, and haste slower if enchanter
is not around. How much of a role do they play in a group?..also .is there a
"demand" for them? I begining to think the offensive line of spells are just
for soloing..but i could be wrong?
