I found most of my stuff in my earlier harvesting days.
So far I have collected 3 coral, 2 yarrow, 2 sisal, 1 silver, 2 severed bone
and destroyed 2 other items I didn't realise were rares at the time.
I'm not sure how the new tradeskilling changes have affected things, but I
think you still need to get the advanced alchemy books that contain the dye
and ink before you can consider making the adept.
I have filled three orders for adepts, only within guild though - I get so
nervous that it's going to go to crap =)

I was really lucky in that I bought a coral for 1gp, they normally sell from
12-20gp on Najena.  What is even sillier is that people sell the silver even
higher when it can be substituted for coral.  Maybe I missed something and
it is used as a rare in another recipe like jasper/palladium where the
palladium is used in the heritage quest torque.

I also find the spells that help warriors etc get taunt and the like are far
more popular when selling, and I don't mind selling some down to 20s-30s as
its many times more than what I would receive from the vendor anyway.
