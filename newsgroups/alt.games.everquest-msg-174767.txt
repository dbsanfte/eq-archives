It wouldn't work for one simple reason: The goalposts will keep moving. 
If the Pentagon is lying and the system is actually aimed against Russia 
and not any rogue states, then Russia will have to keep designing ways 
to defeat it. Here is the news: designing a new missile is a lot quicker 
and cheaper than designing a defence system against it. Not to mention 
the fact that with the US making enemies left right and center in the 
middle east, what's the point of alienating also the biggest potential 
ally in any conflict in the area? Apart from Tom Clancy, I really don't 
think anybody misses the Cold War that much.

Because it's not a good idea to shore up the hole with dynamite. :)
