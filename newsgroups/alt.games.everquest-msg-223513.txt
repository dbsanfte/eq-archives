Hunting, the windows I have depend on the character.

Enchanter - Main window, pet damage window, group/chat/tells window.  (And
if I raid, a raid window.)
Druid - Skills window (to hold the tracking spam), main window.
Warrior - Damage window, guild/chat/tells window, main window.  (And if I
raid, a raid window)
Trader Mule - Main window, tell window OR tell popups, and sometimes a
guild/chat window.

My eyes get too tired using too high a resolution, or else I'd probably go
"larger" and use more windows.
