*strange look*

Sure. Many raiding guilds on TT know what days they'll be raiding, and what
time they plan to start. I'm a member of one of them. I wouldnt get a LDON
that would run into that time without warning the group members first.

'The' mob?

The raison d'etre of a raiding guild is to raid, hence the name. Raids start
for us at a given time. We might not know *which* target it'll be, but we
know *when*. Even more so, given the arrival of instanced raid content.

Even back in the Ssra days we knew what days we were likely to have to rush
for Emperor and which we were not.
