Pitty, I always figured war should be neutral.  After all, will Paladins not
wage war against evil?  Now, I just wish, since Zek is an "evil" god, that
ShadowKnights and Nekomancers could worship him.

The only character I did that for is my DE Chanter.  It seems a little
absurd to me that other PC's can tell which god you follow.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
