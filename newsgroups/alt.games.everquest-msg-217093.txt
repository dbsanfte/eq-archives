I dunno, I guess they figure most people are intelligent enough to
understand the concept of rounding and that, if the mob is still
standing and attacking or fleeing, it's still alive.

If seeing a mob alive and the HP indicator, which doesn't have decimal
points in the %'s, sitting at 0% confuses anyone, then they need to
take up a game that's going to be less taxing on their brainpower...
Like Whack-A-Mole.
