I often do use Google and many times search either the Web or Google groups
for information and sites I seek. However, since we were discussing these
here and you seemed to know quite a bit about them, it seemed reasonable to
ask for more detailed info right here.

Basically, I could opt to never post or ask anything here or anywhere else
for that matter and simply search Google. But I like talking with people
about things of mutual interest. I am neither lazy nor stupid but I guess I
am somewhat sociable. Like many of you I imagine, I have been using the
Internet for longer than the "Web" has existed.

Oh, and I do visit dictionary.com as well from time to time.

Sorry if I seem cranky here but I can see referring someone to Google when
you either do not know the answer to their question or for whatever reasons
simply prefer not to answer it. However, if you do know the answer and you
intend to provide it, I really do not understand telling someone they should
Google for it. I interpret that as mild annoyance that I failed to look it
up myself and a pointer to do so next time. Feel free to correct me if I am
wrong. Ha! ha! Now, that's a silly thing to say on a newsgroup isn't it?
Here of all places on earth one can always depend upon being corrected if
they are wrong.

Thanks for the detailed reply there. I already wear glasses and I need them
to see well. So I don't think the option of glasses like these would likely
be something that would work out very well for me. But maybe I will try
getting a cheap pair from somewhere on the net and see how they fit over my
regular glasses. It wouldn't surprise me to find them on amazon.com

Well, I don't do crappy monitors and I don't do 4k monitors so that rules
those options out. Of course, I couldn't see myself buying any monitor for a
single purpose use like 3D EQ anyway myself. On the other hand, cheap
glasses of the cereal box variety and a free driver download might be of
interest just to see if buying a nicer pair of aforementioned glasses might
be worthwhile. Again though, there is the issue of locating something I
could use on top of the glasses I already wear and need to see. Now, this
could be a search for Google and in fact I think I will go conduct one right
now.

Thanks again for the info.
