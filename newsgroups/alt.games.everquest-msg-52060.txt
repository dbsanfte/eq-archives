If your only goal is to get to level 60, not to build a viable character
capable of fighting in any camp in the game, then I suppose you
can dispense with AC entirely.  As a druid, its certainly posible
to avoid getting hit while soloing outdoors.

On the other hand, your suggestion that you expect to group and
not get hit doesn't show much experience with grouping, particularly
in dungeons or raids.  You will get hit.  Its not the plan, its not what
you want to happen... but something will spawn or roam in
unexpectedly, something will break mez or root when you didn't
want it to, something will decide your healing put you on top of the
hate list...

What you want your tank to do (and its not really his job, what
you want your enchanter to do is the real answer) is get that mob
to -stop- hitting you.

Unfortunately, if you have about the same AC and HP as a caster,
you will very likely be dead before that happens, when you are
facing mobs in the 50+ range.

Defense skill is the difference between having the AC of a wizard
and the AC of a rogue.  Yes, rogue's AC also sucks, but its
there for the same reason yours is... to let them handle being
smacked around long enough to get the mob back off of them.
