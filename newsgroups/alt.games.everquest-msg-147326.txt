It seems that after a certain point you do become able to hit "by magic
only" mobs if wearing magic gloves. My shamans Slam attack used to be unable
to slam wisps after obtaining her magic gloves. Now, I am able to slam a
ghoul successfully. I don't know when the crossover happened, I just noticed
that it was working.

OT:  Does anyone know if you can get Outlook Express to place the cursor and
