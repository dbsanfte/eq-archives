I guess this is what I get for not reading the
descriptions/requirements fully before getting/creating stuff, eh?

Today, I did the Songweavers Boot armour quest and forged myelf a nice
pair of boots in N Freeport. The only problem is that I'm a Wood Elf,
and apparently Human and Half Elves are the only races that can wear
these damn things.

Now I'm stuck with a NODROP item that weighs several pounds or, at
best, takes up a slot in the bank/backpack.

Is the only way to get rid of this stuff, to load up a single pack
with everything that I want to get rid of, and then walk straight into
an Orc Centurian and lower my head??

I hate giving up the XP that I will, but I also don't want to carry
this stuff around either, if I'm never goin to use it.

Suggestions??
