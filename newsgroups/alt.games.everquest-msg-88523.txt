Just a thought but *if* these people were making factual complaints in a
civil and (lets just assume) intelligent manner on a forum and were then
banned, then  perhaps they were also the sort of people who'd think "Fuck
Verant, they don't want my custom I'll go elsewhere" instead of "Fuck
Verant, I'm gonna bitch and moan on every forum I can"
Again, just a thought...
