No. Being unable to find a path to you is quite a bit different from not 
surving long enough on that path to reach you. Even in AC1 you could 
aggro kite as a caster or archer.

IIRC AC1 also had a timer so that if the mob couldn't path to you, *and* 
it took more than x minutes to kill it... it was a safe bet you were 
standing on a pole or inside a locked house.
