I'm gonna remember that, but this time I am only interested in one
thing. :-p

Way back in time, to a little after Kunark was released. The guild I
was in on Tribunal (the Elitists, probably the worst name of any
uberguild out there, but AFAIK they are still on top of Trib after all
this time as they were then so I suppose it's justified :-p ) did
decide to do exactly what you just described - they decided to do
Nagafen with only ten people despite considerably more than that being
on. This was after the pet nerf (making ubermonsters summon their
masters) but before Naggy and Vox got their <53 limit put in (this was
one of the incidents that led to it actually). The ten people did
indeed kill Nagafen and the loot was kept inside those who went.

Okay the reasons were different than what you just said - they weren't
afraid of looking like they were zerging, they just wanted to see if
they could do it. But it did lead to some minor grumblings in the
guild, grumblings that could have been seeds to dissent further on if
that was the sort of thing that would continue.

However, the <53 was put in and this sort of thing basically has never
happened again to me. Every raid I've been on since has wanted
everyone who could come to come (in the guild).

Until PoP at least, where it seems the flagging system has done more
to drive wedges into guilds than everything before it put together, if
guilds deliberately don't want their own members to come, don't want
the bother of flagging their own members, if it meaens more
competition in higher tier planes.
