Seems to me like you're the guy trying to piss people off. No where at any
time did Rcsmiley say that he believed Navarro to be a liar.

As for the subject, I -do- remember reading that statement by Kelly Flock...
on the other hand, I -do- remember reading somewhere that it was forged, or
something to that nature. Am I saying that Navarro is a "lying piece of
shit" by going against what he said? No.

You tend to live in constant rant mode...
