Quote from Brad:
"I'd said from the very beginning that it was our intent to charge for
large expansions and to release smaller ones for free."

Small - The Hole, Jagged Pine, Warrens, Stonebrunt... free

Large - Box set expansions with new races, multiple zones, features
etc... Not free

Latest expansion - Not in a box, but with multiple zones, new race, new
features, etc.  ??? 

You all be the judge. If you can't afford the 18 bucks, then don't get
it. I don't think it will stop you from making 65 or getting
uberitem_028943.  Others seem to be doing fine thus far without a
fucking frogloc.
