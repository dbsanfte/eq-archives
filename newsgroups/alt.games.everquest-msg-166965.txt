Toughest class: I'd have to say enchanter. Bards are more complicated,
but that's because they're far more self sufficient. Enchanters are
hard to play well and damned near impossible to solo without major
twinkage.

Toughest class/race combo: Ogre shaman, tough class to play well
coupled with the worst starting wisdom in the game. Close runner up is
wood elf warrior for stat issues plus all the damned SoW requests.

Toughest class/race/religion combo: Innoruuk-worshipping dark elf
enchanter. Faction issues galore.
