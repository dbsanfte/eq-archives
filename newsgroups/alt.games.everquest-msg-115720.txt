I'm a Dark Elf Necro who would like to do the Stein of Moggok quest (and not
involving creating alts, and preferably with as little assistance as
possible due to the hours that I'm usually on and not able to find many
others, one reason for being a more soloable class).
    I've looked at the guide at
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=13
The problem is I've found a few problems I'd have.
1. They want you to be an enchanter.
2. You need to go through Erudin, wouldn't I be KOS?  Is there another way
to get the Erud's Tonic?  What kind of faction work is needed (if no other
easy, probably solo way, or get someone to get it for me)?
3. Honey Jam from Rivervale. I killed a halfling in Nektulos.
4. The fish corpse.  I've read (above website) that now after a recent
patch, the wolf "Frostbite" will give back the tonic you give him to make
him spit back out that dead fish (not sure which is worse, carrying a dead
fish, or a dead, partially digested fish...but I'm a necromancer so I can't
really complain about the dead).
5. Oggok Faction - I've read you need to get to amiable to turn in the final
items. Some claim Indifferent, but is this REALLY confirmed?  I've seen just
as many claim Amiable is needed.

    I'm only LV10 right now (may be LV11 by the time I get enough info to
start), so I wouldn't mind the hunting involved as well.  What simple quests
can be done to help my faction?  Time (reasonable amounts) isn't as
important.  I'd just like to earn the item, its been a while since I've done
anything like this.  And I've also heard that the things needed to do to
finish the quest will end up improving factions, making it easier next time
(and the faction work is the hardest part).
    Does a NON-Enchanter guide for this actually exist?  Or can someone
please help me with the information to get the quest done?  Any helpful
would be helpful and appreciated.
