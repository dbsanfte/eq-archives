From what i understand, and I may be wrong, but 1st edition Win98
has a problem with addressing memory ABOVE 512mb. That means
you are wasting a good portion of your available resources. I dont know
if second edition remedy's this problem, but I would suggest any other
window flavor above that such as XP, but please no WinME.
