You have 45 AA and two abilities that are L59, but are so low level
you can't make a level cap?

Even if you stopped at 59 for some bizarre reason to shift completely
to AA, it only takes a couple weeks of pretty casual playing to get to
65 from there, especially since you can solo anything that doesn't
summon and are a dps class with a ton of demand in tier 2 and 3 along
with LDoN.
