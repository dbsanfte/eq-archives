Rangers tend to outdamage warriors by a very healthy margin,
I'm not at all clear why.  Both have dual attack and dual weild,
and the same limits on haste items.  Given similar weapons,
you'd assume that they would do roughly the same damage.
Perhaps its the "given similar weapons" that makes the difference,
are there a great many ranger only weapons out there that
are tipping the balance in their favor?

Another alternative is that rangers may have more money to
spend on weaponry, while a warrior has to sink most of his
cash into AC/HP/STA gear to be able to do his job properly,
the damage output on his weapons is largely an afterthought
(key for him is delay and perhaps an annoying proc, in order
to maximize taunt)

Other than that, you do make me wonder.  Its just an
accepted fact of life; warriors paladins and shadowknights
absorb damage, monks, rogues and rangers deal it out.
