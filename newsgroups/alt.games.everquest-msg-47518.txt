Hey just wonderin, when i get to level 60, and i got every single best item for
each slot in the game,  i want to start a lottery. like have everyone guess a #
between 1 and 10,000 and whoever gets it first gets however much pp the # is
(example if the # is 5893 then they get 5893 pp). i was wonderin, is this
allowed?
