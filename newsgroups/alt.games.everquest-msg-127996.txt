Nailing these proffessional merchants would be the easiest thing to do and
it is quite obvious VI could not give a crap about it, and I would go so far
as to suggest they quietly accomodate it.

When I picked up Chimp (off a small time seller, no feedback) of course the
first thing I did (and what every single new account purchaser does) was log
on and change ALL the account details. It now has my name, my address, phone
number and credit card details in it. If someone with the username does a
password retrieval it comes to moi. This couldn't be done at one point in
time and has been changed to be so, which is why I suggest they accomodate
the changes.

Now how hard would it to be for them to find those accounts where all the
details and payment options have been changed? Too bloody easy. All the info
they need to catch me out (and likely most others) is in their possession
already.

I think they only take a tough stance for show to back up their "not our
problem" stance when shit hit's the fan and keep all the Dark Tyger's happy.
At the end of the day though, I find it pretty hard to accept they give a
stuff what happens to an account beyond they "are we still getting 10 bucks
a month?" aspect.
