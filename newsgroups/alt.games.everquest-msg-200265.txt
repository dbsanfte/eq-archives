First.  Do you know about "conning" a monster?  Place your pointer over the
monster and right-click.  If it is any color other than green then you will
get EXP if you kill it.  If it is yellow or red then it is probably too
strong to take on.  Look for monsters that "con" white, dark blue and light
blue to you.  If you have some good buffs up or have better than newbie
equipment then you may be able to take down a yellow.  This one fact alone
made my first taste of EQ sour.  I started a Barbarian warrior and was
hunting in Everfrost.  After making level 5, I killed who knows how many
polar bear cubs before I realized none of them were giving me any exp.  Some
newbie zones are better than others.  I personally hated the Everfrost zone
due to the Vengful line of skeletons and the fact that after level 5 or so
you had to venture out into the open tundra.  All that wide open space can
be intimidating to a newbie since there are no guards anywhere to be found.
And all of this was before they changed the game so that if you died before
level 10 you would respawn with all your equipment still on you.

At your level, a few good zones you could check out if you are a good race
are East Commons, Greater Fay if you hunt over near Crushbone, Misty Thicket
and Qeynos Hills.  There are monsters in these zones that can and if given
the opportunity, will kill you. Know where guards are that you can run to in
an emergency.  There are also so great zones in Luclin but it has been
awhile since I started a character and have not given those zones a shot.

Finally, Everquest is more than a Diablo or NeverWinter Nights.  It will
take days of actual playtime to get a character into its 30s or higher.  If
all you have is an hour or two to play every day or so then EQ may not be
your game.  I spent over 7 hours last saturday of non stop playing to get my
warrior from level 45 to 46.  The game appears to be hard for two reasons.
If it was like any other game out there then you would have level 65 players
running arround after a few weeks of hardcore playing.  That would ruin the
game and the shelf-life of EQ would erode.  The game requires a player to
make a big investment of his time.  You are now part of an online world.
You complain about the time it has taken you to make 5 levels but there is
someone else in the game who has been working non-stop to finally get their
epic quest completed.  It may have been something they have been working on
for over a year and finally, they have succeeded.  And with that there is a
sense of accomplishment that is very satisfying.  I have played other
MMORPGs.  I got Dark Age of Camelot the day it was released.  Spent two
weeks getting a character to level 20 so he could start participating in
realm combat.  Quit playing about 3 weeks later due to the absolute boredome
of the game.

If you are frustrated starting out then that is a good thing.  How you
handle that fustration will show more of your character than anything else.
Once you learn the game, if you choose to last that long, you will discover
how much fun and rewarding EQ can be.

I personally never want to see a more "kinder/gentler" Everquest.
