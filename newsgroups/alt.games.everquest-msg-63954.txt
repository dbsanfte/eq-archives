Its in my windows system folder. I got no such message so mine is fine
I guess.

I believe its an Ole update or something if you don't have it.

In 98 I did the microsoft web update, and continue to reguarly so I
have the newest files. In 95 you's have to go to a mickeysoft patch
page manually I think.

www.microsoft.com

Ah yes, im good....  did search for 

oleaut32.dll update

http://www.microsoft.com/Windows/SOFTWARE/servpak1/moreinfo.htm

In that case it comes in service pack one for win 95.

"This page lists the fixes contained in the Microsoft Windows 95
Service Pack 1 Update."

So update your system with any service packs you don't have of
whatever operating system you have.
