That would be useful to know. Anyone confirm either way whats best for raid
situations. I'm getting to the point where I will be participating on the
larger variety thereof.

Thank you both for the advice. 33.6k Hardware just about to be installed ;)

I have to say though, that the 56ksoftware one I have been using has been
very reliable. What I'm really hoping for is my bad FPS issue in certain
zones (CoM to name but one) to get better as the hardware modem will free up
cpu as you say Rastus.

Cheers, much appreciated.
