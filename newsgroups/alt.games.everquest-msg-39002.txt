I'd love to see this in some crime-ridden mega-city *g*

Them: Yeah, I wanna report a theft.
Police: What happened?
Them: Well see, I gave them this stuff to hold, then I 
went home for awhile, and when I came back, they were 
GONE.
Police: And what was the name of the person you gave 
your things to?
Them: Eddy.
Police: Their full name?
Them: I dunno.

*ahem* You get the point :)

Anyway, who DOESN'T make enough friends in the game that 
they need to find a *stranger* to hand things over to?  
I can think of a dozen people *outside* my guild that I 
could ask to 'hold stuff' for me.
