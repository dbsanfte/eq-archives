If a mob lasts for 5 minutes, then a 3 minute snare is going to run out.  The
fact that the mob didn't last 14 minutes isn't relevant, if it lasted more than
the shorter duration then the longer duration snare worked.  A 2 hour snare
would be excellent for casting on pets.  If it was rarely resisted and very
cheap to cast it would indeed qualify for "best snare in the game".  But Ensnare
isn't a better snare than Snare.  Ensnare costs more to cast, takes longer to
cast, and isn't any less resisted than Snare.  So if you are stopping runners or
using snare to split mobs, then Snare is better.  If you are working on multiple
mobs or long lived mobs or using charmed mobs as pets, then Ensnare is better.
Both examples of the Snare line are however superior to any example of the
Darkness line for most purposes.

I imagine there are uses where the Darkness line is actually better, say
splitting mobs for example, where the DOT part might remind your target where
you are while leaving his buddies to go home?  Or as stated elsewhere in the
line, when you don't have any cheap damage spells memmed but need to do a little
damage to a mob to avoid losing huge chunks of exp to your pet, having DOT and
Snare in one spell does save a spell slot.

Its not insulting to suggest that you might be missing certain fine points that
are central to the arguement at hand.

If you can snare without breaking mez, then you can snare a mezed mob and then
let the MA build aggro before breaking.  If your snare breaks mez, then when you
stick snare you immediately have the mob coming for whoever is tops on his hate
list, possibly you or possibly some other caster who is also in the middle of
gimping the mob.

If your snare breaks mez then if you get an add which is unmezzable, but have
the original mob snared, then you can't switch targets and mez the original.

If your snare breaks mez then you can't pull a mob with snare and then mez it
when you get to camp.

These aren't trivially important issues, they are the sort of thing that gets
done with real snare all the time.  Necros don't do these things with snare
because they can't, they simply don't have a non DOT snare to use.

I have yet to see anyone fling an insult here, at best we've demeaned your
knowledge of other classes or your ability to respond to points that are being
made instead of making up your own... but nothing personal has been said to my
recollection.  Of course DT hasn't really chimed in yet, I suppose in the long
run such things are inevitable, but you seem to be anticipating them.
