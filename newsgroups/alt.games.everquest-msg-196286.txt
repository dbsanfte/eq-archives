Actually, it sounds to me as if Terry has the right idea.  Among the few
Bards I've grouped with more than once, every one of them was good at CC
and every one of them was very insecure about it.  My suspicion is that
it was that insecurity that goaded them to work hard at it, and it sure
seems to me that one hard working Bard is worth any number of laid-back
manasong players.  Bards can be amazing, but realizing that potential is
an awful lot harder than stating it, or so it appears to me.
