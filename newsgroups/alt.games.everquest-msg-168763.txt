Paludal is great XP.  Don't get used to it.  Gets harder to get xp. 
Though as an Ench you'll probably not have a hard time getting in groups.
One thing you have to do is slap around your tanks (the 
warrior/rogue/whatever the people whacking on the monsters) if they 
break mezzes.  Some of them refuse to listen, some don't know yet and 
have to have the 'rules' explained to them.
One suggestion is Netherbian Lair or Marus Seru after 24 or so up till 
30.  After 30, I went to Dawnshroud but that may not be the best place 
for a chanter, well, maybe if you can get a tribals group going.
Here are some websites you may want to check out:
www.eqatlas.com/atlas
www.allakhazam.com
eq.crgaming.com
anybody know a good chanter site to recommend?  I don't play chanter class.
Make sure you pick up any loot that has the word 'pg.' in it.  Those are 
for some of your spells.

Good luck
