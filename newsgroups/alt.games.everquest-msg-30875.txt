Well judging from your comments, it seems you haven't caught up with
what you've missed in the last year. You may want to go and read some of
the old patch messages on castersrealm or somewhere. Lets take them in
order:

Guess this one isn't for you then.

I often have trouble finding clerics to group with, and I gather at high
levels a lot of clerics quit or just let guildies play their character
on raids etc. They probably aren't as common as you think. My guild on
MT is desperate for clerics to join, for example.

Pretty much a grouping class. You can try to solo a bit, but most of an
enchanters spells aren't direct attacks on a mob, rather they facilitate
others with buffs, debuffs, crowd control, etc. I shouldn't worry
though, since it is very easy to find a pickup group with an enchanter
after you hit level 16.

There is no xp penalty anymore. Racial xp penalties still apply, but
class ones have been removed. Its been implemented this way - if you are
a hybrid, say, so you have a 40% xp penalty, you still have that but
every mob you get xp from will give you 40% more xp than it used to -
the extra 40% of xp is created out of thin air, not taken from your
groupmates share (was just a quick-kludge way to code out the xp penalty
it seems). Similarly, you lose 40% more xp from dying. So your xp
numbers are bigger but your xp bar moves at the same rate as your
pure-class friend's.

Also, xp in groups is now just distributed by level, rather than
according to the total xp you have already, so there is no reason for
folk not to group with a hybrid - e.g a level 20 groups with a level 30,
the level 20 gets 40% of the xp, i.e. 20/(20+30), and the level 30 gets
60% of the xp, i.e. 30/(20+30), regardless of whether they are hybrids
or not.

This doesn't include the increased grouping bonuses, and the additional
zone multiplier bonuses for xp that have been added.

Very much so - compared to their brokenness a year ago, they've become
one of the highest damage dealers in the game (in the right situation)
and are highly sought after.

no hybrid penalty, see above.

Seems about right, until you get to raid-level then everyone wants them
again. It's not as bad as a year ago though - now you have a built-in
subgame, Gems, to play while you med :)
