Hmm...

I've done a lot of hunting in Oasis (from 15-20 doing crocs,
and then 30-35 doing Sand giants, and 40+ doing Spectres,
not to mention a lot of times passing through on the way
to/from Lower Guk), and I've never, ever seen them 
just decide to take a vacation from the island and go 
wandering along the beach.

I can think of one reason they would appear to, though...
In many zones (most notably OOT and all of outdoor Kunark),
if you get far enough away from a mob that has aggro on
you, it will retain aggro, but "give up" chasing you and
return to its spawn point (if a static spawn) or resume
wandering (if a wandering spawn).  However, if you come
back and get anywhere within a very large radius of them,
they will consider you worth chasing again, and light
out after you.

Given how slow Spectres are, and thus how easy it is to
outdistance them, perhaps what you saw was Spectre(s) which
had given up chasing someone and returned home, but then
that someone made the mistake of waltzing back within
several hundred yards of the island again.
