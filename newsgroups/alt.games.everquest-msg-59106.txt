Okay, so I'm job hunting on account of the wonder company I work
for is shutting down this office.  One of the search agents I have running
at FlipDog emails me and is from 'jobhunter@flipdog.com'.

When I glanced at the new mail header I thought it said it was
from Jobober.  Guess I've been playing my new Mage too much.
*sigh*

JeffL  <--thinks the tech job market around here sucks!
