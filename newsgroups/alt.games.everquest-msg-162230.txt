Do ya think so?  And here I thought I got the idea from watching
hundreds of people play and comment on the class.  In fact, one
of the things that turned me off to DAOC so fast was that they
decided to cater to those who want that, their archers are all
sniper/assassin types, iirc.  Personally, I prefer heroes that
are heroes, I'll take Aragorn (Ranger) or the Gray Mouser (Thief)
over any assassin anyday.
