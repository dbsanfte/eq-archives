Step one ...

Stop calling yourself a Shadownight you are playing a ShadowKNIGHT.
Yes I know that seems a bit pissy but every post you have made so far you
have used Night rather than Knight and its getting annoying.

If your in shadowhaven your almost in the bazaar infact its the next zone
across.
http://www.eqatlas.com/luclin/shadowhavenmap.html

Eqatlas is your friend, either print that map out or if you have the new LoY
expansion hit the backspace key in game to bring up a map (you might want to
download the maps from here http://www.eqatlas.com/cartography.html )

As to what you should buy ? Well you didnt say what you have already but
http://www.magelo.com is a good way to show people what you already have.

With just over 100pp you might want to look for validus custodus armour, its
pretty good AC with nice str boosts and sells for around 2pp per AC on AB
but you will lose some AGI however.
I dont know what weapons you are using but some of the new 1 handers comming
from LoY are nice and sell for around 15-30pp so they wont break the bank,
and the axe of frost is a good starting 2hs
http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=25004 they tend to sell cheap too.

Paludal Caverns  ( http://www.eqatlas.com/luclin/paludalcaverns.html ) will
provide you good exp up to around 23-25 then if you can find yourself a DS
class (Mage, Bard or Druid would be best) run over to the needlite camp in
Echo caverns ( http://www.eqatlas.com/luclin/echocaverns.html ) this should
provide fast exp all the way to 30 (My bard made 25-30 in one sitting here
as did my Mage)

And once you hit 30 you will get your Feign death spell, but it will very
difficult to cast due to high fizzle rates, get out your Endure cold spell
and cast this over and over until you max your Abjuration because the last
thing you want is to fizzle away the last of your mana when you have Bob the
gnoll and his whole family beating your brains out.
