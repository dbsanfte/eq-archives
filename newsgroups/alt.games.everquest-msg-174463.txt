    Everything is up. And if you don't kill it, someone else will. Let me
describe patch day on Quellious:

    Explicit kills (starting as soon as the server comes up) Agnarr, Seru,
whatever they find in Ssra other than Emperor, AoW/Tormax.
    Vis Maior takes Vex Thal.
    Wraith clears the rest of Ssra, then kills whatever PoP stuff is up that
they need (Carprin, HoH trials, etc.).
    We (Lotus Cult) kill whatever PoP stuff is up that we need to flag
folks, up to and including Rallos Zek.
    Rel In Por goes after Ssra, especially Emperor, and cleans up the lesser
SoL content as they find it up.
    Eternal Honor Legion clears NToV.

    What the hell is left? By the day after the patch, you're fighting over
what little is available that would actually help your guild. By day three,
it's repops and timesinks. Wraith does the Ring of Thule in CT and the Ring
of Vulak in NToV just to keep themselves busy and keep the loot flowing.

    If you do nothing, you get nothing. If you try, there's a chance (which
is usually a good chance) that you'll come away with something.
