But I didn't pay any attention to the yellow text after logging in the
9th -- sho should I go to for the Adventurer's Stone?  My home city is
Kelethin (Wood Elf Ranger).

I can't enter any of the dungeons yet (only L17), but would like to at
least get it out of the way.

Thanks in advance, and sorry for asking what is probably a stupid
question.

Take it and run.
