Your pushing a fine line here. I agree with you to a point, but its a
slippery slope to a ridiculous end: Perhaps I should just quit "playing" the
game, and spend all my time in highlevel zones looking for common rots
nobody 60th level even bothers to pickup, begging for uber-buffs, and
spending what cash I come into on other peoples excess loot. This will
ensure that I bring the most to my groups...  Perhaps groups should start
requiring this, and rejecting warriors that don't have a high level
chloroplasts and 1000+ hp buffs cast on them...

I'm being facetious here, of course, but really... the day I 'owe it to my
prospective groupmates' to cover myself in equipment and buffs that can only
be leeched from the highest level characters instead of playing with the
stuff I earned is the day I stop grouping.

sure you slow down groups who's idea of playing eq is to level up to 30th in
PC, and then move to X for 30-50th, and then ... but anyone who's actually
interested in playing the game isn't going to have much fun in groups like
that anyways. He just needs to find the (somewhat rare) people who share his
view that the game is about *adventuring*; that getting the items on ones
own is what makes it satisfying to actually have them... vs. powerleveling
and/or cash farming so you can skip all the low/mid level content while
buying/begging 'junk' the hi-levs have no use for.

There is a place for powerleveling... regaining lost xp, catching up to a
friend... soloing & twinking up an alt, etc etc etc... but there should be a
place for people who just want to play the game at a slower pace, who'd
rather spend an hour camping light blues for a quest then spend yet another
hour in PC ...

I understand your sentiments and agree to a point. I expect the people I
group with to have reasonable weapon skills, any spells that they can buy
from merchants, 'reasonable' weapons and armour (though my definition of
reasonable is far lower than yours) and so on. But I care far more for a
competent player with a good attitude than someone buffed and twinked to the
tits. (And you can rest assured that these people with earned equipment tend
to be very competent... you have to be to make any progress in EQ without
hi-lev handouts.

For example: I played with an enchanter yesterday at 14th level, who didn't
have invis, root, mesmerize, her animations nor charm... she just nuked and
meleed and that's all she did. When I asked her about it she didn't even
know she had access to invis etc, and had no idea what mez even did... how
did she get to 14th level? Well ...when she was level 2 some 'kind soul'
cast it on her for the first time. Since then she logs on begs for these
buffs in the PoK, and then finds a group and goes hunting...when they wear
off she makes a trip back to pok for a refresh. In a group of 5 killing
whites non-stop she refused to even play unless she was buffed well beyond
our level.

Worse, she was a terrible player... just run in and start casting /
meleeing... no attempt to single pull, no attempt to crowd control... hell
she was an enchanter and she was acting like main tank-- in a group with a
Ranger and Paladin...

Ironically despite her complete uselessness and incompetence at playing her
class she brought a great deal to the group... she was virtually unkillable
even with multiple yellow adds, could tank better than either of our
meleers, and could nuke seemingly forever...  I'm quitting the day I'm
playing my 20th level mage... LFG and someone sends me a tell... "Get
Clarity3, 2000 hps, KEI or whatever and you can join us...  your
'prospective groupmates' think that you can reasonably manage this..."

That isn't an EQ I have the slightest interest in playing.
