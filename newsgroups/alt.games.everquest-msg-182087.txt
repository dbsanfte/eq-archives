I have to agree with James kill in overthere until you can solo(your
druid)the giant fortrace ,just bind close and kill from 28 to 30 or so,(the
forest loop is a very rare drop and can sell for 400p).Just thought of this!
Also the tunnel to Dalnir has two spawn places for Brutes they give great ep
plus good bling bling and drops.No use for KEI because if you have both
caves you can time them so you can rest between the spawns.But they tend to
be camped,also they are like cold blooded animals like crocodiles ,they
could care less if you killed there neibor.Check the tunnels first.Check EQ
Alas for the specifics.
