There is something at present (well actually its a combination of things)
that will crash a zone.

It can happen completly innocently too (unlike the last zone crashing which
was an obvious sploit) so not every occurance is malicious.. Being able to
reproduce it is obviously a very powerful tool in the hands of griefers..

I don't know how long the old zone crash method was in place (agro a mob,
zone out, immediatly as you zone out unplug your modem/close EQW, few mins
later zone crash, guaranteed) im sure it was in place a long long time
though... the only reason it got fixed is because it became so widespread -
it got posted EVERYWHERE so everybody knew how to do it.

I am assuming somewhat, because the first I knew of that particular crash
was when it got posted on the major boards (which was fixed within 5 days of
going public, fyi)

Anyway the current method that I said can be done intentionally, again its
an assumption really.. I haven't been able to perform a zone crash at will
(or even once successfully, but then I don't spend my time trying) but I
know kinda why it happens.. and what needs to happen for the zone crash..
Theres one part that sometimes happens of its own accord that I haven't seen
repeatable yet though, and its all 3 events together that cause the crash.

I found 2 without looking, so im sure somebody found the final part too
though

Ok.. the /report text is wrong then.  Read what it says next time you make a
report.

Also.. if you have multiple windows, is the report window specific?  Of
course thats assuming it makes a text log file, and not just a screen dump
somehow.. I dunno ;/

Er.. the deal was.. if they kill the dragon they have to flag 30 of your
guild too, but if you won they got no flags?

Thats pretty fucked up..  there was no guarantees you were going to win that
day, even if you had the exact same people who were present at your previous
killing

You got loot on the other trials?  Not fair, we never do :(

Er.. why does the other guild lose out because of your misfortune?  If they
are in the zone first, and ready first, they shouldn't be restricted by a
GM.. especially on a server with NO gm-approved rotations.   I mean it sucks
you guys lost loot.. but it isn't the other guilds fault or problem.

Look on the bright side... the crash means the mob is right back up.. and
you get to have fun raiding it again :)
