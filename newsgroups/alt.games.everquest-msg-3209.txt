First, let's take care of four things right from the get go:

1) Don't let your melee skills get too far behind your level.  I was a group
only shaman, and now my melee skills are much too low to be of any use.  It
is also hard to raise them while fighting mobs that do 100 points of damage
per hit.

2) Don't waste a spell slot on Gate when you are grouped.  You have SOW to
cover your own arse if things go poorly.

3) Have Serpent Sight or Spirit Sight up at all times.  I know you already
have infravision, but you'll be glad you did when your divination is maxed
at level 29 while your peers are continuously fizzling in their attempts to
cast invisibility and unltravision.

4) Don't let tanks get down to 40% before healing, that's nonsense.  It's
all about confidence at that level, so start healing no later than 60%
health.  If the mob aggros on you, no big deal.  You are built to take a few
hits.

Spell slots while grouped would look like this:
1- Light Healing
2- Drowsy
3- Frost Rift
4- Inner Fire
5- Stregthen
6- Fleeting Fury
7- Dextrous Aura
8- Spirit of the Wolf

Drowsy does not slow down the mob that much, so casting it is optional.  You
should only be casting Frost Rift on really tough mobs.  You can use Inner
Fire as a cheap 20 point healing spell.  Try to keep SoW up on everyone.
Use strength and dex on up to two main tanks.  If a monk asks for Feet Like
Cat, tell them "when mana permits" and forget about it.  Give the monk
Strength and Dex like everyone else.  Use Fleeting Fury on up to two tanks
during the battle; it has a fast enough recycle time to permit this.  Stop
using Fleeting Fury if you get below half mana.

Good luck, and KEEP YOUR MELEE SKILLS UP!
