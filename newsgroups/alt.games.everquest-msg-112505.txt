On this note, and I don't know whether this'll be any help, there's a handy
little utility at:

http://home.ptd.net/~don5408/toolbox/enditall/

It's called (as you can no doubt guess) 'End It All', and it runs through
your background programs and processes and shuts them all down for you.  You
get the choice to protect items that you want to leave running.

Might be worth a shot.  And no, I didn't write it.  :o)
