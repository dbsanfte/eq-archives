First they make L1 thru L9 work like an arcade game.

Now they've not only made pet classes easy to play (isn't pet
control, especially working with an Enchanter, the true mark of
a skilled pet handler?), they've gone and made the Enchanter pet
almost useful.

What's next?
Rogues get a discipline at L35 guaranteeing a single pull every time?
Monk Mend skill becomes a personal CH?
Paladins and Shadowknights actually get detectable damage output?
Warrior regen rate doubles?
Rangers get more hitpoints than a Wizard?
Wizards get Harmshield?
The sky falls?

PS2 anybody?

[mostly tongue in cheek... they wouldn't really let Paladins hurt mobs,
or give Rangers hp... would they?]
