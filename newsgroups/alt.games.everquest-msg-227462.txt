And officer award does not?

Because Guild Drama sucks.   If you want to talk about unhappy people,
awarding loot is a very good way to get them.

Are they related to or sleeping with the officers, are they part of the in
crowd, etc...


I feel sort of the way that you do about DKP systems.   Awarding loot is
evil, bad and evil.  Having said that, it's not so bad. : )

My main disagreements with it are firs that it's not impartial.    Even when
the officer is trying thier hardest to be fair to everyone, I don't think
it's possible to separate yourself 100% from your feelings, and prejudices.
I don't think it's possible to get a 100% impartial officer or council to do
 loot.    Then there is guild drama.  As I said in another message... even
if the leader managed to be 100% impartial, it will never seem that way to
all of the people involved.   Some will always be unhappy with the
decisions.   Fights and hurt feelings are almost inevitable.

For an example...  take a situation where a Blade of War is awarded to a
paladin over a knight.  The weapon without a doubt does more good for the
guild in the hands of the warrior... but the warrior missed 2 raids last
week, (his first misses in a month) while the knight had perfect attendance
for the whole month and a half.  The paladin did BoT key farming for the
guild, and Trials for the guild, and tanked Ssra key farming groups in her
non raid time.    The warrior in his non raid time tanked the 10'th ring war
for a guildmember, who was also one of his good friends.   Oh...  and the
paladin is the wife of the guildleader.

Was there favoritism displayed in awarding the BoW to the paladin?    And
more to the point, do you think that the warrior will see favoritism in this
outcome?

If the answer to either question is yes... inc Guild drama.


Which is not to say I'm totally against it.   I prefer certain DKP systems,
but I would be willing to do Officer Award if it was with an officer / group
that I trusted.  In my opinion it has less potential for bad things to
happen.
