Ok 1 thing about Everquest that is very nice is the it is self contained,
you can copy your Eq directory to any machine and it will run and configure
itself to that machine. I have swapped the same folder from 95 to 98 to ME
and 2000 without problems. I transfer the folder from 1 machine to the next
all the time via a LAN. The only problem I have ever had was once I had to
reinstall Velious on the new machine. Being I am a network administrator I
swap computers out on a regular bases (once to twice a week) I use EQ as a
burnin. If there is a problem with the machine EQ wont run very long without
crashing (at least that's what I tell my boss) LOL. Nothing test a computers
entire system like a good graphic intensive game.
