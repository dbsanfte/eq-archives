The way they did the axing was to run a program that went through the
database and produced a list of guilds for each server that needed
axing.  These lists were given to the GMs, and they deleted the guilds.
These lists were by number, not name, so if guild 145 was supposed to
get axed, and 154 was not, and the GM happened to transpose the 4 and 5,
the wrong guild went.

At least one of the guilds that got hit by a typo was a guild with
hundreds of members, and they were not pleased. :-)
