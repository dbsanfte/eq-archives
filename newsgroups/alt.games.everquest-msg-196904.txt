So many people RAVED about HHK I couldn't wait to get there!  Finally arrived,
found there was a waiting list to get in a group, and there was much yelling
about KSing going on.  Logged off.  Next day?  Same thing.  
I never ended up playing inside the keep, ever.
I did play outside in High Pass and liked it alot.  It tended to be over camped
too though.  NOT worth the run.
