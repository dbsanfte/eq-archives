COH is just too casual for its own good. You log in and the only thing
you do, in missions or regular play solo or grouped, is kill stuff.
You kill and kill and kill and, unlike EQ, you advance VERY rapidly.
Compared to EQ it is INSANELY rapidly. 

If you were satisfied, in EQ, getting on around level 45 and playing
for 6 hours killing stuff to get a bubble of XP then COH will really
surprise you. If you play for 6 hours you'll more likely get a level
of xp.

You casually get to level 25 -30 without blinking an eye, about a
month and a half after release. When the game tops out at level 40,
that really doesn't leave much more left to do. Couple that with the
fact that it is so incredibly linear, in terms of where you get
experience, and it really limits the game. 

Because I'm so casual, EQ pretty much kept up with me. I was level 47
and about to get to the point where playing would no longer make sense
and then kunark came out. What I mean, by no longer make sense, is
that once I reached level 50 there would pretty much be no point in
playing. There was no epic back then, so you reached 50 and got your
planes set of armor and were done. Then you pretty much just raided
the planes over and over, then over then over, then over and over,
then did one of the dragons that existed, then raided the planes,
repeat. 
Kunark REALLY slowed me down, post 50. Post 50 xp in EQ is totally non
casual. It just takes forever to make any progress. 

The difference is really that EQ gave me things like faction work, low
experience quests, loot camping and other things to do besides just
grind. In coh there is only grinding, with rapidly respawning mobs, or
missions with tons of good xp mobs all to yourself (as well as often
large experience rewards at the end of them.)

So, besides being mired in downtime, EQ really slowed me down with
other things to do. In COH the other things to do also involve killing
mobs for xp. 

COH seems like it is designed to be a short term game. This really
makes no sense, from a money making perspective. I could not think of
a way to design a MORE short term game if I tried. If I wanted to
think up an mmorpg that a person would play for 2 months, then quit,
it would be COH. I can't understand them doing this, though. It makes
no business sense. 

They do this with the expansion being a year away. In the case of COH,
this is WAY too long. I believe that an update raises the level to 50
before that, but even that does not seem to be happening any time
soon. If I had reached 40, I'd have already quit playing.

Unless the update radically slows down the rate of gaining xp, 40 - 50
will be over in a few weeks at the most. Then you'd be sitting on your
hands for a year until the expansion.

So I don't think COH is "it" either. It seems like another mmorpg they
put out to compete, yet it kind of missed the most important feature
to design for:

Longevity.

Without it the thing can't make that much money since people will
leave. There isn't more to do, there isn't loot to camp, there are no
AA points to get. EQ always kept ahead of me, when I was 55 or so they
add AA and move the max level to 65. There was always something
keeping ahead of me.
