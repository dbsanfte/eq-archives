Hey, wow, it's Gay-days bashing on a non-Disney thread (this topic is one of
the first signs of spring on WDW ng's).  I'm tempted to point out to you
that Disney is only one of a number of companies which provides insurance
coverage to homosexual life-partners (following very strict guidelines for
naming of said partner), or that "gay-days" is a non-Disney event (and that
any group anywhere at any time can organize an event at Disney World, even
pay to have a park solely for your own group) but I have a feeling these
things would fall on deaf ears.  It would also take the topic even farther
off track.  Oh well, what the hell, I just did it.
