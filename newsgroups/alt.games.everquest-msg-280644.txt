I'm also inclined to beleive that the author (who of course is not a 
Sony employee, merely a web-columnist, and the figure in question was 
only tangentially related to the subject matter so good 'fact checking' 
can hardly be assumed) took half a million divided it by 52, got 9615 
and then guessed that the servers were supporting up to 10,000 players.

Suggesting that each server only supports 10,000 accounts has some major 
inconsistencies. EQ lets each player have 8 characters PER SERVER. Now 
very very few people have done THAT. But practically EVERYONE I know has 
created a characte or two on at least one other server. (be it a couple 
weeks on a Zek, or FV, or a testbuff on test, or a server someone they 
met in RL plays on...) sure in many (most) cases those characters are 
essentially abandoned, but they are still there, with the accounts paid 
in full each month.

10,000 accounts per server with 52 servers leaves almost NO wiggle room 
for the number of accounts with characters on multiple servers. I mean, 
I have abandoned characters on 5 servers (even post merge). I'd be 
counted 5 times under meldurs assumptions, and I'd wager that a very 
very large number of accounts would be counted at least twice.

I'd fully expect the number of "sever-accounts" to be at least 50% again  
or even double (or beyond) the total number of subscriptions.

So at its PEAK, with 500,000 subscribers I'd have expected 500,000 - 
1,000,000+ server accounts. Which is a *heck* a lot more than 10,000 per 
server with 52 servers.
