Then there are the druids who *want* you to beg. I had one in burning woods
the other day. I did an /ooc "swapping clarity for soe", and this druid
pretty much started teasing me about it.
IdiotDruid001: "Oh you want soe do you? well look at my guild tag. I dont
have one, so I dont have soe" .
Me: "Ill take sow, soe lasts longer but whatever"
IdiotDruid001: "Ahh now thats a better attitude"
Me: "Ill come to you, or im near DL zone"
IdiotDruid001: "Good of you to give me a choice"
<waits a couple of mins>
Me: "Oh well, guess il glug a sow potion. nevermind"
<glug>
IdiotDruid: "I can sow you, where are you?"
Me: "Doesnt matter now, maybe later I might need sow"
IdiotDruid: "Let me know when you want sow"
Me: "Sure, ill let you know if I cant find one"

Suddenly when he realized I had sow potions and he wasnt gonna get his
clarity (or be begged) he became really helpful. Too late for him. Of course
it wasnt long for other sow classes to show up in zone.
