    I would hope that the healing class has a better purify than the tank
class. But again, clerics still won't buy this. You need RC III anyways, and
it's miles better than Purify Soul.

    Excuse me? Clerics get a better heal, so melees can actually stand in
and fight longer against an AoE mob instead of shooting arrows and junk, and
get a better invulnerability, so early aggro isn't as much of a problem for
warriors, and melee are falling further behind? Here's a hint: you WANT
clerics to be as godly as can be. What you don't want are enhancements to
DPS casters.

    No, and I'm sorry if it looked that way the way I phrased it. I think
it's one of the great AA's a cleric can get now - I'd put it on par with
Radiant Cure for utility. Prior to the change, it really wasn't worth it
until you'd done most everything else available.

    So until those classes that think they need enhancements the most get
all their enhancements no other classes can have things fixed? And I
wouldn't get in a pissing match with a cleric about useful versus useless
AA's, Mr. Monk. I think rogues are the only class that gets fewer useful
AA's than us. Most guild rogues report being "done" with non-resist AA's
around the 150-180 range.

    AC that stacks against the AC cap, like all buff AC does. And it's not
some POS small amount of AC, either, it's significant.

    Heh, we have one guild on our server that essentially kills Rallos Zek
with large numbers of people with high damage shields. SotW is actually a
key part of their admittedly odd strat.

    The ones like me without CR capped do. =/

    No, you're missing the point. Someone is curing people in their group
with SE, say. CR is cast by another raid cleric, and bounces off the people
with SE. Now SE ends, and the group cleric needs to keep healing them.
That's the sort of annoyance that SotW doesn't have to deal with because it
doesn't have those stacking conflicts.

    It isn't second-rate, because it stacks. If we had to cast SotW OR CR,
you'd have a point. But we can cast BOTH, and have BOTH working at once.

    I can't say I understand why they did it either, but I like it. And so
should you, Mr. Melee Manasink!
