I'd say the "whatever reason" is role playing.  While CoH might not have any
more hard core RPers than any other MMORPG, the impression I got is that a
lot of people do at least role play a bit.  Jumping in when you come across
a fight is a natural thing for Superheroes to do.

I also see fewer lame or stupid names in CoH, and I think that too comes
from the role playing.
