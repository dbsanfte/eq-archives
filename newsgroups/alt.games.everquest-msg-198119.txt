Level 61, Average gear with Malo, Torpor and Tigirs.


I tanked it of course, the druid played main healer both times.  The
enchanter did mezes and a few nukes, runes when the boss spawned.   The
shaman did chain nukes, slowed the boss (and maybe some of the others) and
backup healed once the boss spawned.
