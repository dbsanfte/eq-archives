Sadly, you need to delete that one for the time being. With no warning
whatsoever, servtech uncerimoniously took down their web servers when
they were bought out. :-(

I have the new web space, but have thus far been too lazy to move the
page over. However, I *will* get to it this weekend and post a new link.
In the meantime, anybody wanting that info can e-mail me and I'll send
ya a text version for now.

I'm so lazy. :-(
