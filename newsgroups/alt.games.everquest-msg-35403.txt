>> I was just wondering if there is any way of switching out weapons for
insturments without going into the inventory. <<

You can make hotkeys for most every slot there is. So, the easy way is to do
this:

make a hotkey for your main weapon, and secondary if necessary. Underneath
them in your hotkey area, make a hotkey for an open inventory slot.

then just switch weapon for instrument in the hotkey area, and never have to
open your inventory again.

It's just that simple.
