Wrong.!

Case in point....

Wed. night I took my baby druid (level 24) to South Karana for some
Aviak killing. On two occassions while root/rotting Dark Blues (at
1/2-2/3 mana), I got Avocet (red conning) adds (damn wandering mobs
:-P). It took skill and mana managentment to finish off the two mobs
juggling snare/root/dots/dds. Most of the time I was working with less
than 1/4 bubble of mana fighting resists and staying out of melee
range medding just enough mana to buy some time with a level 5 root.
It was fun exciting and challenging. I used the experience and skills
I learned playing a Druid to 52 on my old server 3 years ago. KEI
would have made it completely trivial.

Wrong again.

When quading it only takes a couple of resists to ruin your day. AE
spells are only mana efficient when hitting multiple mobs for full
damage. If you get too many resists, you will run out of mana before
finishing the quad, leaving you with 1-2 mobs still up and after your
hide.  Anyone can quad with KEI and the right spells. Skilled players
can do it when things don't go according to plan.

>Root/Nuke, same thing.  Charm soloing, same thing.

Again wrong and wrong. KEI is a huge factor in any combat that
requires mana. Mana pool and mana regen are the only thing that limits
the effectiveness of a caster. Increasing the pool and the regen rate
trivializes any encounter that is difficult or almost impossible
without KEI.

Bards get no benefit from +mana songs or spells.

The most important skills that any caster can develop...

Mana management, and how to handle a situation when things don't go as
planned. 

To a lessor extent it makes it even harder for solo casting classes to
develop grouping skills (and meet/interact with other players) before
hitting raid levels where grouping is required.
