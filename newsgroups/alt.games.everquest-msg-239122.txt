My idea was meant to bring all epics up to date, and didn't speak to

The problem is that, for some classes anyway, the epic isn't all that
tough to get.  I could probably do the entire Ranger epic, up to
swiftwind anyway, with a partner or maybe two people to help.  So now

Yeah the Berzerker epic is damn nice compared to the others, but so
what...they can't track.
