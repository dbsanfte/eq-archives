Subject: Trying to recover my corpse

When I was in the field of bones in Cabilis, i became lost looking for the
Plane of Knowledge transporter. I got whacked by a trooper in the lower SW
corner ruins. Everytime I go back I cannot get to my corpse. I tried using the
Keeper of Lost things ( Corpse SUmmoner). When I hail him he has in brackets
[bodies} - what reply do I use for him to return my corpse there?

Or is the lvl 15 paladin lost forever.
