Healing:  100 HPs for 60 mana, instant
Superior Healing:  583 HPs for 250 mana, instant
Celestial Healing: 720* HPs for 225 mana, 24 seconds.

*Castersrealm has it at 744 to 748; spdat has it at 720.
I took the lower number to be conservative.

So:
CelHeal --  720 HPs/225 mana = 3.2 HPs/mana
SupHeal -- 583 HPs/250 mana = 2.33 HPs/mana
Healing -- 100 HPs/60 mana = 1.67 HPs/mana

Celestial Healing is not only vastly better in HPs/mana ratio
it's better in raw mana spent as well.  The only heal that's
more efficient that a cleric can cast is Complete Healing (if
the CHeal regains more than 1280 mana.)

Add in the low aggro associated with the HoT line and
Celestial Healing is going to be a spell most clerics will use
from the time they can mem it until they upgrade it at 59
with Celestial Elixir.
