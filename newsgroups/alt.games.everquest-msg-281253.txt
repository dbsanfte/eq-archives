Oh no, Estate of Unrest is still a lot of fun.  Problem is we owned
that one wiht Gobs of O' in the mid-teens.  I guess owned isn't
exactly accurate, we did have a 44 cleric backing us up.  But really
it wasn't as needed as we thought.  We have a boatload of DPS, and an
SK with a fungi tunic (he's the puller).
But none the less, its still a good zone.
