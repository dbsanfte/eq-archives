Of the 3 the warrior is best soloing . The equipment available for many
diffrent tasks is best for warrior , next best for rogue and finally monks
can only use a very limited set. Warrior mitigation is so good that warriors
can usually solo using only half there hps allowing there bind wounds skill
to be much more usefull then it appears. Weapons that proc slow and snare
are also prevalent. While many will tell you that the other 2 classes vastly
outdammage a warrior this is not true. Rogues do but only from the rear
requiring a snare proccing weapon and a sucessfull intimidation skill check
. Warrior weapons closely approach monk weapons, comparitvely only gaining a
slight advantage over a warrior in pure weapon dammage and deriving most of
their extra dammage from wus which requires substantial AA.

None of the 3 even approach the ability of a caster or hybrid to solo.
Though all 3 are very good as literally wading through most green mobs which
is something casters without hard hitting pets cannot do.
