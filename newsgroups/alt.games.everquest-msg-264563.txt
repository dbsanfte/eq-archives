Everquest: After level 40ish, death in EQ is generally trivial unless 
you die in an out of the way spot with no cleric. It's usually not that 
tough to get someone to rez you (here, 40 plat for you to click your 
stick sir), and if you are good even an unrezzed death can be taken care 
of in a couple of hours. The evil of EQ is losing access to your body, 
but I actually kinda miss that in the games I play. Also, by leaving 
something on your corpse you can go continue to play while waiting 
several hours for a rez; significantly different from most other games, 
where it's rez where you lay or when you go back to bind, no rez. In 
many ways compared to many games the 'real' penalty for death is less 
than others due to the easy access to rezes, the ammount of xp high 
level rezzes give back, and the fact that you can go about your business 
while waiting for a rez, comparred to lying on the ground for 45 min in 
FF or DAoC. The only big ouch in EQ is dying too close to a level and 
de-leveling, or on certain specific levels (such as right after a hell 
level) where the penalties are out of whack. (may not be the case 
anymore... they fixed a lot of that)
Final fantasy: My problem with dieing is that if the rezzer bit it, 
we're an hour away from productivly getting back into the xp game. The 
xp penalty even without a rez is fairly benign. In a good zone with our 
well oiled machine of a group we average about 60-70 xp each a kill 
(varies because the faster you kill 'tough' things the more xp you 
get... it's called an XP chain)
To level at 32 is 6000 xp, death gives you 10% hit, so 600. If you have 
a bed in your moghouse, it takes of like 5% of that, so what, 30? (yeah 
big deal). Assume no rez (at our level, rez would be 50% back)
570/50 to be assume the EQ equivilant of dark blue, we kill about a mob 
every min and a half or so when we are rockin, less than 20 min to make 
it up. Compared to it may take an hour to get back to where we get xp, 
becuase travel is tough.

Now, FFXI has a wierd XP system, mobs give XP based on con, so that 
means killing the same con mobs, we get the same xp at level 10 or level 
75. However, the levels get more and more expensive. Level 70 is xp 
39000, means the penalty for an unrezzed death is 3900 -5% (200 xp), 
with you earning the same xp, which would be a 2 hour or so death 
penalty. unrezzed. Raise II gives 75% xp back, cutting the penalty to 
about 30 min again (raise 2 is a level 56 white mage spell)
Raise 3 (level 70 white mage spell) gives 99% back.
Note that because white mages get 'reraise' spells (cast a buff on 
yourself that lasts 15 min, if you get killed, wait for the area to 
clear and you can automagically raise yourself.) if you have one in your 
party at that point you should never have a total unraisable wipe if 
he's good and you are not pulling in the middle of a field of mobs, 
where he won't be able to raise himself. Reraise 1 is like level 33 or so.

Oh, you can level down in Final Fantasy, just like in EQ.
