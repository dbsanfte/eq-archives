My Athlon 2000 xp died on xmas day, so was replaced yesterday with new
mobo and cpu, an Athlon 3000 64.

So far, I can crank up the graphics quite a way before encountering
drops in framerate.

Unfortuntaley, the the event that killed my mobo and cpu also killed
one of my DIMMs, so i'm down to 512mb at the moment, which will cause
a few slowdowns on it's own.

Gryffon rides look a lot better, now  I have my character detail
ramped up, and the gryffon looks good too, as I have my setting for 2
characters max detail.  I've also turned on flora, to max disance, 25%
density (and love hove the grass bends when you run through it).

I have a GeForce 5900xt, by the way.

They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
