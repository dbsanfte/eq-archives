So what is your point? nowadays there is plenty of cheap equipment to get
him over the 100 sta threshold.
Sure 2 years ago it was an endevour to get a woodie ranger over 100 sta but
not anymore.

Here's where you loose me.
See the problem is that you are trying to compare apples to oranges.
Knight weapons may appear to be better upon first glance. But that is only
if you ignore a few important differences between the classes.
First being that there is a reason that knights get those awesome 1 handers
and its becuase they will never be using dual weild with them. Even beyond
that the lower offensive skills of a night make those weapons less effective
in their hands.
Where as a ranger or warior armed with a pair of Lammies will be tearing up.

Apples Oranges bro.. they don't compare. Because the two classes use those 1
handers differently. A knight with a sword and board is not doing any where
near the damage as a dual wielding ranger under most circumstances.

Well in the case of AC that is built into the game. Plate classes have an
advantage in that dept just as plate clases mitigate damage better than
rangers do. This is needed otherwise what do knights offer to a group?
If a ranger mitigated damage the same as plate clases no one would bother
grouping with them since a ranger can hold agro amazingly well and maintain
do far better damage than knights. So on armor I'll grant your case but
there is quite a bit of armor that's pretty darn affordable for a 34 ranger
nowadays that isn't that far off from what a knight or warrior can get their
hands on. Treeweave anyone?

NO argument from here on a ranger being a tough character to play however
knights aren't exactly easy. Ask a 30-40th level Pally for example how good
a soloer he is?

Your sta will still drop to zero in a long fight, But everyone figured out
the sta effects a long time ago and though sta gear is not the easiest stat
to find its not all that difficult (or expensive) to get enough to get the
average ranger beyond 100.

Apples oranges.
Hell a ranger in that level range has never had it so easy. Silvery
swiftblades (nice light very fast ranger only 2 hander 16/24) are
practically given away nowadays. Argent protectors and defenders are pretty
reasonably priced and one can pick up a centi SS for less than 500. Lammies
are pretty modestly priced nowadays and there is no shortage of good
reasonably priced 1hs weapons out there. (not sure on the current pricing
but last time I played a defiance was only like 1k) even if you consider 1k
too pricy for a weapon on a 34 ranger stuff like dragon horn yaks and most
kurnak age gear is cheap. and even better you don't have to drop 5-10k on a
FBSS anymore.

Being able to type /baz does not make one knowledgeble about this subject.
Because there is more involved than simple ratio stats and prices.
There are reasons why knights get those weapons with the insane ratio's and
there is a reason why they practically give them away.
The reason they get the high ratio's is to makeup for their lack of dual
wield and lower offensive skills and tables. The reason why they are so
cheap is because no one uses them ergo no demand. That really awesome
looking 1 hander knight weapon is selling for practically nothing because it
sucks.
There aren't many who would forgo the advantages of 2 handers to take
advantage of those good prices.
The reason ranger usable 1 handers cost more is because they do not suck.
Ergo there is a greater demand for them there for the higher prices.

Look up prices for knight 2 handers you'll find that those tend to hold
their values better than the 1 handers.

And I'd be very careful about calling other people ignorant on a topic when
your own knowledge is less than perfect.

The difference in tanking has very little to do with gear (though of course
better gear will make a diff ) and mostly to do with game mechanics. I find
your claim about gear availibility to be a tad well.. Vapid. Empty and
meaningless. I've got a warrior twink at about the same level as we're
talking about and most of his gear is ranger usable because these really
isn't all that much high ac gear available for a warrior on the cheap.
A couple bit so of Coby that have no stats so are strictly for AC (arms
boots helm and gloves). The coby chest legs and wrists are so damn expensive
that your best options tend to be gear thats available to chain classes
anyway.
As far as weapons go rangers and warriors have access to pretty much the
same weapons so its not like either of those classes have an advantage over
the other. Knights have some weapons that may look better as far as pure
stats go but aren't really that great when you understand the game mechanics
and grasp the fact that a knight with a 1 ratio 1 hander still isn't doing
more damage than a ranger dual wielding .5 or even lower.

We deny your examples because its obvious what the ones you are using that
you have no understanding of the underlying mechanics of how combat works in
the game.
Also because its obvious that you have a rather poor grasp on the concept of
supply and demand.
If for example those high ratio 1 handers that are available to knights were
really that great they would be in use not for sale. The low prices reflect
the fact that they are not in use. Because any knight worth his salt is
weilding a 2 hander.

A BABs doesn't require any sort of higher level or group to obtain all it
takes is some plat and the luclin expansion so you can go into the bazaar
and type /baz. Just the same as all those knight weapons you keep talking
about. Hell ain't no 35th level character or group obtaining a SSoY or a
Velium lance. But they can be picked up in the baz for a song.
Shit I give drakle forged bastard swords away and that's a better weapon
than a babs.
Lack of processes should not be an issue for a ranger procs=agro and at
those levels that's something you want to avoid anyway. If you want procs
though there are plenty of choices available on that count as well. Just
pick up a couple yaks and you'll be a proccing fiend.

My responce is that there are plenty of choices available and that your
assertion about the availability of knight weapons is based on a false
understanding of the game mechanics.

Oh I have a perfectly good grasp of basic logic and I can tell you what the
flaw is with yours.
The flaw is that you're basing it on a false premise that being that only
the stats and ratio's of the weapons matter and the fact is that there are a
large number of game mechanics issues that makes that premise false. such as
Dual Weild. And warriors do not get a superior selection of weapons to
choose from as compared to a ranger. There are a few items they get that
rangers don't but that's more made up for by the fact that there are a few
weapons that rangers get that warriors don't.
