I'd agree that /random is the fairest way of dividing up loot but I
still don't like it, and luckily Bristlebane is a server where
everyone seems to do NBG. Even in pickup groups I can't recall the
last time someone had a problem with it. Two reasons for it:

- I like looting gear that I can actually use and would rather have
someone I don't know loot an upgrade than win it myself then sell it
in the bazaar. 

- I realize this is purely subjective but in my experience the people
that prefer NBG aren't nearly as hung up on loot as the ones that
think they're missing out every time someone else loots a NBG item. 

NBG tends to forge friendships (ime) and at the end of the day that's
worth a lot more than winning the roll on some item that's gonna be
obsolete anyway by the time the next expansion rolls around. 

Rgds, Frank
