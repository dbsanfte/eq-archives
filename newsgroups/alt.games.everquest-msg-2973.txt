The trouble is, tanks don't keep casters alive, healers do.  So don't worry
about it, it's not you they don't trust, it's the healer.

But yeah, running is a bad idea...critters tend to die faster if the tanks
can hit it.

Nukers who aggro a critter have over cast on them or casted too soon.  If
it's possible that they might learn something, let them know this.
Enchanters and clerics get hit a lot. The only INT caster that tends to get
hit a lot (or at least on top of the hate list) are enchanters.  If wizards,
mages, or necros get aggroed it means they goofed.
