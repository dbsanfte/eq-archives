I have been playing my Bard on and off for a year now. Once I got to level 
28 I took a short hiatus from Everquest altogether. I have now come back to 
playing my 28 Bard with the intention of playing him exclusively.

Now, I have had read up on charm kiting, but I was having a hell of a time 
applying it. I went to Frontier Mountains as suggested to me to start my 
education. I have however, found that it was a little to hilly for my 
liking to hone my charming techniques, so I moved back to the old world 
areas to level a bit, and to make a little cash. I remembered reading 
somewhere that most of the Old Cazic Thule MOBs were now just outside the 
old Dungeoun, so I made my way to the Feerrot, ran to the bridge, and found 
some nice blue mobs to work on.

I had no trouble with any of the Mobs except one Tae Ew Page. Every time he 
would get down to 20%, he would heal himself up to 80% without fail. I 
couldn't seem to ever overtake his healing power. (Is there a way for a 
bard to interrupt casting besides dual weilding on him?) After going 
through 6 rounds of him healing up, I mezzed him, charmed one of his 
buddies, and commenced to wearing him out. Two rounds of charms later he 
was dead, and so was his buddy.

Having played him mostly melee up to this point, it was amazing to see what 
he could do when things got hairy. I continued to play with charm that 
evening, and leveled up to 29 while netting some pp and fine steel weapons.

I feel like this character is finally coming into his own now. I offer 
something to a group, but I can also solo pretty well now that I have fear, 
charm and mezz capabilities. Now I just need to learn how to charm kite the 
bigger mobs. (giants and the like)
