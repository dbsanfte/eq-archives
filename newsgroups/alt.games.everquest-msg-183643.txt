Saw a name a few days ago on Xegony, went and checked it out.  Sturmfuhrer.
Found a website of the same name.  Judging by the appearance, a neo-Nazi
organization.  So, petitioned, then pestered a Guide with /tells to make
absolutely sure that he got that name written down and, hopefully, banned.

(Yes, I know there's also a band by the same name.  Guess what?  I don't
care.)
