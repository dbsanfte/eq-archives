I was a bit suprised by that.  I had all 7 keys in my inventory (2-7 and 
Tserinna's Key) and when I clicked the key on the mirror to 2nd, it added 
'Tower of Frozen Shadow: 7' to my ring.  I then ran up to the 4th floor 
without clicking keys on mirrors, just clicking straight on the mirror, but 
had to run off to a guild raid.  Does Tserinna's Key get added?  Will it 
really not take my group with?  I'd really like to empty out this backpack.
