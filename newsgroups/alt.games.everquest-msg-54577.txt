I had full Diamond/BD gear, earrings, rings, neck, before lvl 40 and got all
the Gems myself. It is true that it might take a lil time, but a 50 shammy it
should be easy enough. 

Theres a Quest that start in colbert scar from the Otter Chief on the beach, He
ask for 4 Ulturk tusk for a "random gem/jewerly" reward. the gem can be any
gem, and the jewerly has no stats. 

If you want to just get the tusk fast and collect them for the quest go back to
Easter waste and camp the Ulthurk pit to the north. Warriors your best bet. Or
you can follow the coast in CS to the left looking at the water and try your
luck with the ulturks there. These are alot tougher.

Other thing you can do if your in a good guild, get 2 good groups of people and
Farm PoG. We've done in on TZ with 10 people +lvl 50. just a couple options for
you.
