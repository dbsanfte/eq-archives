I don't envy the MMORPG designer who is tasked with implementing the thief
skills or class.  These games in essense boil down to stat based combat.
The thief class by nature is a loner and/or utility class.  To make them
truly useful would be to unbalance the rest of the game.  This is not to say
that I wouldn't love to see them implemented correctly.  It's really the
only class I've ever wanted to play.  I have high hopes for NeverWinter
Nights.  I think/hope that NWN's particular design will lend itself to a
much more workable implementation of the thief class.

Best Regards
