Alright, correction, MOST class xp modifiers are...well, not really
"gone", but worked around so they effectively don't exist. Hybrids
weren't the only ones with xp penalties, theirs were just the worst.
Clerics, shamans, and druids were the "baseline". Warriors and rogues
had a slight bonus. Int casters, monks, bards, and hybrids all had
penalties. If I recall correctly, the reasoning for leaving the rogue
and warrior's bonuses was to avoid protests. They wanted the change to
be a benefit, not a nerf for anyone.
