I have a number of the level 2 focus items, on twinks, as they are not all
that useful to my shaman.  I have no level 3 focus items at this time.  The
lower level ones are mostly on my druid and enchanter, as those are the two
twinks I play the most.  Extended range is cool, I can pull from far enough
away to land a second spell.
