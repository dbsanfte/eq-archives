He shouldnt complain if someone comes along and kills G while hes shopping,
but if hes been camping it before he should be able to come back and
continue camping it. just my opinion, and I know a lot of people wont agree
on this. I used to get this a lot while camping outside paw before the days
of kunark. I wouldnt mind someone picking gnolls from my spire while im not
there, but I'd want my spire back thanks! I dont feel I should have to deny
myself trips to the vendors to "maintain my camp", assuming im not taking
ages over it.
