It can be handy on a raid to keep clerics from getting aggro, maybe not 
at the high end, don't really know, hardest mobs we are doing so far are 
Doomshade, Vindi, Xenamech, etc.  It can be handy as a last minute way to 
save someone that is not going to get a heal in time.  But, for the most 
part, yes, a gimmick.
