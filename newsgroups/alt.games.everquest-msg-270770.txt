well hmm that IS how I work it... great minds work alike.

 something I do is any driver or update I download I save on both
drives as well as  files that I feel would hard to replace...

   Annie does not do this so this reload will take 4 times longer. I
do not know how long she will be down. I am taking time to try to make
it  smooth BUT think she will be down for 2 days a least. 

Also i have not loaded or Reloaded XP before so this is new to me but
i think it will be like NT4.0 ( I hope ) 

 2 more problems I just found is 

1) how do you slick drive C so i get a clean load.
2) how do you change Drive letters right now main drive is C: the CDR
is D: and the hard drive is Drive I: lol

anyway 
   Thanks
        Lenny 

PS hope you all under stand this sometimes I think a lot faster then I
type and do not put in all the words that I need to be understood
