I have your own words, below, though you obviously don't fully comprehend
the situation.

But then, in my experience, guides rarely did.  =)

And seeing someone coming through after the named.  I've been in BoT.  I've
seen the OOC.  =P

As well, explained below so you understand what was actually said, I'm
*sure* that many Palludal petitions are "I'm petitioning you"  "Fine, then
I'm petitioning you".  I've taken twinks there.  Again, I've seen the OOC.

Parties, i.e., party 1 (a soloer) says party 2 (a soloer) KS'ed them, and
party 2 (still solo) says that no, party 1 (also still solo) actually KS'ed
them.

The party of the first part hereinafter referred to as party 1, does hereby
impugn the good faith and fair dealing of the party of the second part,
hereinafter referred to as party 2, and party 2 counterclaims in like kind.
