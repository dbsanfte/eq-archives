Modulation Rods, items summoned by High Level Mages.  Think of it as a
Mage's Version of Cannibalism spell.  Which converts HP to Mana.

Clerics, for the most part, can afford doing this, especially without
convient Necros to Foreign Mana them (Hence the term for Necros being
considered Mana Batteries), when they have Celestial Heal or someone like a
Druid or Shaman Regens them or Chloroblasts them.  Res Spells tend to dump
a lot of mana in a short period of time, hence the reason Clerics tend to
ask for money for Rezzes out of the blue.  The fun thing about the Cleric
Epic, so I am told, is that they can 'clicky' stick rez people, with no or
nearly no mana suckage on them.  And as he mentioned before, spending 5
minutes to rez instead of 30+ minutes to rez a bunch of people is a good
thing, especially on a raid where the majority of the downtime from a
wipeout recovery is not just the CR, but Rezzing the fallen and getting
them past the Rez effects.

Anyways, another 'fun' trick high level mages like to do, besides the Sand
Giant Pet in Oasis...  Is handing mod rods to newbie beggers.  Mod rods do
a heck of a ding of damage when it converts HP to Mana, usually more than
what most classes at Level 10 and below can handle.  I forget how much
damage a mod rod dings you for for how much mana in return.

Another fun thing to do... Give a newbie an Uthork Tunic.  If they don't
check the stats, they die or go unconcious the first time they put it on.
And if they loot it normally, they go uncon or die again.
