I would suggest giving it a go. Only get the expansions up to new
modelling - planes of power i think.

But, you may find it hard to go back. I've certainly experienced this -
games that I've played and loved, but moved on for what ever reason, if only
just for the curiosity of something new coming along, but then going back to
your old one can be disorientating and uncomfortable. I like the feeling of
coming to a game when it's relatively new. That way I don't feel behind
everyone else, and I don't mean in level, but in my knowledge of the game.

EQ2 is coming out this year so there's another option for you.
