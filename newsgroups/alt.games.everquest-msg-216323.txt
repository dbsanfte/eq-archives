When LDON was first released, groups didn't have a problem with the
collection quests.  Now, every kick ass group I've been in has
ultimately failed collection quests due to the lack of drops.
Tonight, our whole party couldn't even get into a dungeon after
accepting a quest.  The entrance was bugged.  I also think the drops
are bugged.  The failure rates are totally ridiculous, especially with
the awesome group we had tonight.  What's up with this?

I don't care if I have to stand at the Adventure Recruiter for 30
minutes while my group takes a nap in order to get a Mass Kill quest
instead of a Collection quest.

Anyone else having this issue?
