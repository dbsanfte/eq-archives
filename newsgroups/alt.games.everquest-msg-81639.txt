Really? Is this for fun or for the long haul? Just asking because while
all classes have their place, and are fun to play, SK can have a tough
road in the raiding world post fifty. But anyway, enjoy. On to your
questions.

At certain points in your career, yes, you'll find you can do a bit
better dps with some two handers. But once you get to where you have
some really hot, low delay one handers, and have haste on you all the
time, it's kind of a wash in my opinion.

Yes. If you are the MA (which eventaully you won't be in the majority of
cases, but for the first fifty levels or so you may be called on to
perform that duty) then your fast two handers will generate more aggro
and keep the mob's attention on you better, saving the skins of the more
"delicate" melee types. Then again, as an SK you'll have a wide range of
"really piss off the mob" spells to toss in also, so getting aggro
shouldn't be much of a problem. If you're not the MA, then a nice, high
damage, but slow two hander is much better to avoid the mob's attention
but still contribute a lot of damage to the encounter.

I'm sure you don't want to hear it, but it's really worth it,
eventually, to keep *all* your weapons form skills maxed. You never know
when the next mob is going to drop a really cool weapon, far superior to
what you're using now, but it turns out to be a piercer, and you have a
skill of one, so it's effectively useless to you for many days. I've
maxed all mine but two hand blunt, and frankly it's just because I was
too lazy. I sort of regret it now.

You probably won't be able to keep them *all* maxed in the low levels,
but don't worry. When you hit forty and cap out, you'll have far more
time than you'd like to max the others before fifty when you can finally
see some skill increases again.

Visit the Steelwarriors web site and read the message boards there. 
http://steelwarrior.org/
You can ask questions, browse the archives, etc. Lots of warlords hang
out there and you can pick up some good pointers.

How much time have you invested in the character? If it's not much, you
may want to start over with a new name, or petition your own name to
have it changed before somebody does it for you.
