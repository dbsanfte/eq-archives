I was running my non-twinked and newly dinged 31
Ogre Warrior through E Commons yesterday and I
decided to stop and play around a bit.  I ran up
to a Kodiak and hit the auto-attack.  A quick hit
and a double hit later the Kodiak began to turn
away and I finished him off without a scratch.  I
think it was at that point that I realized just
how far I had come in the game.  I remember the
first time I peeked into that zone seeing four or
five Kodiaks going up a hill and trembling in fear
at the though of so many "high level" creatures in
on place.  The gate guards are conning yellow to
me, I never would have imagined.

Not long after I was camping the throne room in
Cazic and the mobs were dropping so many fine
steel weapons that we were all encumbred and were
just letting the stuff lay there.  For some reason
I remembered back when I was a newbie and saving
up 70pp to buy a fine steel morningstar from a
vendor in Quenos.   Back then who would have
thought I'd leave fine steel on the ground because
it was more important to fight than loot.  On my
way to sell I handed a lvl 4 Ogre Shaman a fine
steel morningstar just for kicks.

I guess there will come a day when I venture
through Rathe Mountains and decide to knock off a
Hill Giant just for fun and a quick 40pp but that
seems far off.  I'm really starting to enjoy the
game.  Stop every now and then and look back.  Go
to your newbie zone and terrorize the mobs that
killed you at level 1-5.  I love seeing <You hit
lizzard man watcher for 147 points of damage, you
have slain lizzard man watcher>

Having fun.
