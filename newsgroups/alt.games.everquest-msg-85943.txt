And if you did try it that way, you would be very disappointed.  The trick
is if the item you sell does NOT go into the empty slot, that means the
vendor has more of that item.  So you exit the vendor screen, go back in,
hope that the spider silk is at the bottom now.  If it isn't, you buy out
something else, exit, check again.  Repeat until you run out of money, get
sick of trying, or find the silks.  It's a hit or miss proposition.
