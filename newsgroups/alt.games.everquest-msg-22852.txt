Good question.  I hate to post a semi-useless reply but 2 things:

1) I too am curious and would like a cleric-in-the-know to enlighten us
and
2) I don't think it'll work at all.  I've witnessed thousands of
rezzes --mostly my own *shiver*-- (yes thousands.  =P  I have over 93
playing hours on my main).  Every time it has been at close-distance even
when that is unsavory for a cleric to do upon themselves so my bet is that
it would be out of range.

Regards,

-Grim
