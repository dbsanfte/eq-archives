So? How is that any different than any other level?

I can be level 15 and farm spiderlings for silks.
I can be 30 and farm the Warrens.
I can be level 40 and farm BlackBurrow.
I can be level 50 and farm Runnyeye.
What's wrong with Being level 60 and farming Lguk and SolB?
Or being Level 70 and farming Karnors and Velks?

Same shit different levels. /shrug
