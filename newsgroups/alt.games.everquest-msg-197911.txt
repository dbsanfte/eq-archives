    They've done some reporting, like about the new drops off the improved
Maestro. Most people are still trying to find all the epic drops that were
in Hate. It looks like they might be rarer, or on mobs that as yet haven't
been thoroughly farmed.

    The war in Hollowshade Moor was fixed, successfully from the sounds of
it. That's a terrific boon to those that want to raise smithing. Based on
the number of Etched Acrylia Runes I see on vendors, a lot of people are
exploring Acrylia now. It sounds like the new scripted events in Grimling
Forest and Acrylia Caverns are fun and informative (Takashi, leader of the
Grimlings, is actually the undead form of Khati Sha, Vah Shir hero!)

    The changes have gone all the way to the top end of the game. One
encounter that was made significantly easier was Sigismond, the trigger for
the Avatar of Dust. Remember those evil Recluses in Air, Monual? To get the
Avatar of Dust, you needed to clear an entire island of them. Then the real
fun started. The island would re-pop with a big spider, and a whole bunch of
light blue spiders. The whole lot of it would start pathing down towards
where your raid was. So you had to have someone up above kiting a ton of
stuff that procs a stun effect. After you kill the big spider, three smaller
spiders that make Recluses look weak split from it. After the three are
killed, another big spider pops - back up on the island with the kiter.
After going through three cycles of big spider, trio of spiders, Sigismond
(really big spider) can be targetted and killed to spawn the Avatar.

    Well, after the pathing changes the tiny spiders don't path down towards
where the raid is. They sit in place. So no need for a kiter, just pull the
big spiders as usual. Significantly easier.

    The pathing changes also enabled what was briefly the bardsploit to end
all bardsploits, the Halls of Honor kite. Bard would aggro some mobs near
the start of the zone, then go running in with Invis on. Previously, mobs
would get stuck and warp onto the bard from time to time. But with the
pathing changes, you could gather all the mobs in the zone. And you would!
Grab every mob in the place, run them down to one of the big lower rooms.
Highsun (bard gate) all the summoning nameds away, then start the chants. A
bard with the right AA's could get six AA's per pull, with 30 minutes
required to pull and kill everything. Not for the faint of heart, but it got
HoH nerfed. Now, if you have enough mobs chasing you, random ones will gate
back to bind point.
