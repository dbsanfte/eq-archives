Now THIS is the best example of sniveling, scumsucking liberals in their 
purest form. They stole guns from the hands of the people, and now they are 
torturing innocent citizens. Copied from a British newspaper:

"Judicial torture, still on the Statute Book of Scotland, will be used as a 
punishment once more if First Minister Donald Dewar agrees to allow a free 
debate on the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Amendment Bill which is before 
the Scottish Parliament, says SNP leader, Alex Salmond.

Mr Salmond was speaking at the Scottish National Party rally in Edinburgh 
where delegates demanded more effective controls to prevent drugs flooding 
over the border from England. "We have already restored Trial By Combat," 
he said, in a reference to the McLachlan case last month in which two 
brothers fought to the death with battle axes. "Now we must show the 
English government that their writ runs here no longer."

The rally gave him a standing ovation and sang Fluir na h-Albann (Flower of 
Scotland), the banned Scottish national anthem. Police and English soldiers 
stood by but took no action.

First Minister Dewar will announce his decision on Tuesday but sources say 
he has no choice now that the Welsh Assembly has voted pressing can be used 
as a punishment for sex crimes. The new Scottish Parliament is anxious to 
be seen to be as free from English influence as the other Celtic countries 
in the United Kingdom."

Europe, isn't that the place that wants to STEAL all the guns out of the 
hands of innocent citizens and place them in the hands of Stasi, Gestapo 
like governments? How sad. This shows how truly barbaric europe is.

Europe has a long, long history of torture. In the middle ages, they would 
torture innocent citizens in order to extract a false confession. You see, 
back then (just as today) Europe's law-makers didn't care about justice or 
what's right. What the authorities in Europe really wanted was an open and 
shut case without all the hassle of investigating and finding a real 
perpetrator. So, whenever a crime (such as speaking one's mind and someone 
thinking that they have a right to be heard) was committed, the royal 
guards hunted down whoever was accused of the crime first - most likely 
someone the government, or an informant, didn't like - and tortured that 
person until they gave a false confession to the crime. Such torture 
included the following:

THE BOOTS. Also known as bootikens or as cashielaws in Scotland, the boots 
were cruel implements of torture. They consisted of wedges that fitted the 
legs from ankles to knees. The torturer used a large, heavy hammer to pound 
the wedges, driving them closer together. At each strike, the inquisitor 
repeated the question. The wedges lacerated flesh and crushed bone, 
sometimes so thoroughly that marrow gushed out and the legs were rendered 
useless (Guiley 1989 342). 
Urbain Grandier was an innocent victim of a European government, tortured 
by Cardinal Richileiu. The torture was described as follows: [They put] the 
legs of the patient between two planks of wood, which they bind with cords, 
between which they put wedges, and make them enter by blows of a hammer to 
squeeze the legs...[and] the bones of the legs do crack and fall in pieces 
when they are unloosed; and those who have undergone this torture, die a 
little time after (Sidky 164). 
The torture was very severe. Marrow and blood flowed from Grandier's legs, 
and whenever he cried out to God, hist tormentors announced he was really 
calling out for Satan. Crippled by the torture, Grandier was dragged to his 
place of execution (Sidky 165, 166).

THE TURCAS. A device called the turcas was used to tear out fingernails. In 
1590-1591 John Fian was subjected to this and other tortures in Scotland. 
After his nails were ripped out, needles were driven into the quicks 
(Guiley 1989 342). 

THE IRON MAIDEN. "The maiden was a tomb-sized container with folding doors. 
Upon the inside of the door were vicious spikes. As the prisoner was shut 
inside he would be pierced along the length of his body. The talons were 
not designed to kill outright, however, and the pinioned prisoner was left 
to slowly perish in the utmost pain" (Farrington 29).
The following is a depiction of the first recorded use of the Iron Maiden 
on August 14, 1515 : "A forger of coins was placed inside, and the doors 
shut slowly, so that the very sharp points penetrated his arms and legs in 
several places, and his belly and chest, and his bladder and the root of 
his member, and his eyes, and his shoulders, and his buttocks, but not 
enough to kill him; and so, he remained making great cry and lament for two 
days, after which he died." (20 Gnarliest Torture Devices of All Time, 
donated by Marc-Andrï¿½ Mongeon)

THIS is what Europe wants to do to helpless, innocent people. Most 
Europeans hate Americans - they say because we are arrogant, or whatever 
excuse they're using today. But in reality, they hate us because we are 
independant and free. We Americans stood up and DEMANDED freedom and 
liberty, and we earned that liberty through the gun.

Europe wants to torture innocent people to extract false confessions out of 
them. Europe is for absolute Big Brother gun control, and most of Europe 
already has it, with only the nobility and ruling classes with the right to 
own guns.
