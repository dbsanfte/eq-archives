We were not talking about soloing at 60.   Nice attempt to divert the topic
though.

All of those places can be done with one group, and with the exception of two
spots listed, I have done them in one group.  (I have not been to Griegs yet,
and have only passed through Acrylia Caverns on my way to the Ring of Fire).

Hell, I didn't even include the new and improved Cazic Thule.

At this point I'm going to call Bullshit.   If you can, then do so.   And no
fair naming places where you would only be taken in at 51 as a charity case by
a much higher level group.

Not really.   They noticed that they were somewhat light on single group
hunting for high levels, especially with alt advancement coming in.  So they
added more.

See Jeremiah's response, he covered it well.    Alt advancement for something
to do will take a long, long time... longer than it took to get to 60 to max
out, without adding to the player power nearly as much as more levels would.
Keep adding 50+ dungeons, hopefully yes.
