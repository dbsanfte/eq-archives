Nah, they won't up the normal rate... its not really an option. 
If this fails they'd just send the people back to their regular
servers and probably not try it again. I think they will get at least
the 8,000 people which is probably a figure they are aiming at to pay
the cost of hiring people just for that server.

I also don't see the point of paying 29 more bucks for what is really
the same game, with my same characters, but with more babysiting by CS
and some RP quest hand holding (most likely not during the times when
I'd be playing) I basically have learned to ignore the existance of
GMS on my regular server and handle almost all problems myself and
having only witnessed a few gm events which sucked I'm not that big on
them.

Personally I like NPC automatic events. Remember the halloween events
this year where mtns of rathe changed for like a week or more and had
kind of cool no drop loot? Thats a server I'd pay more for, a far more
random NPC programmed event zone change server free of all the static
camping and crap where anytime of the day or night a zone could change
in several possible ways then later revert back. I don't give a crap
about live actors. The future is NPC AI scripted events.. not some
flunky you pay minimum wage to act like the golden fairy and play
games with players.

I'd need a REAL value added.
