yup, use the /pause command.  The number you give is in tenths of seconds.
You can the /pause command on the same line as the /doability command.  So
it looks like this:

/pause 50, /doability 3
/pause 50, /doability 3
/pause 50, /doability 3
/pause 50, /doability 3
/doability 3

The above macro will do ability 3, five times, with a 5 second delay between
each.

That might look a little confusing because the /pause is before the /doability,
but the /pause actually executes *following* the command that follows it.
Weird huh?  But that's the way it works.

Have fun.  I used to use these more than I do now.  When I want to skill up now,
I just tie the ability to my left and right arrow buttons (via the keyboard options).
So I'm constantly hitting that skill button whenever it pops, so long as I'm moving around.

It's easier than remembering to hit the macro button.  You may call this an exploit, but
it makes a lot of sense for "Sense Heading" at least.  I also use it for sneak and sense
traps.  It doesn't work so well for beg.  And a macro works best for fishing.
