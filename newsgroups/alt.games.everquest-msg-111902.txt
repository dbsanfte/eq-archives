I've seen this since I started playing EQ, but I really don't understand 
why people claim bards are rogue hybrids.  Bards are plate class, rogues 
are chain.  We share some skills, but we don't have any of the 
class-defining skills of rogues (backstab, poison).  The only 
traditionally roguish skill that bards get, pick lock, is capped so low as 
to be useless.
