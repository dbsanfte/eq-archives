Okay, everyone knows my extreme distaste for the models of EQ2, but
here's another one...

I do not want voice acting in EQ2. I don't want people telling me, in
game, the names of cities and countries. The way I pronounce them in
my head usually is quite different. Let my imagination fill in the
blanks, people. Don't force "key-nose" onto me, Sony. Please.
