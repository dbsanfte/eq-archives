when there are 4 mobs, all on top of each other, all called "a cutthroat
dervish" all the same race, all conning yellow, with each animation
interfering with each other, pray tell how you detect which one is not
attacking you? Since I had about 350 hit points at the time, and had 3 or 4
mobs attacking for 30-40 damage a time, I can't stop fighting for a couple
of rounds of hits, to see which one is not attacking me.
