Found a use for the acid last night.  You can begin a quest in Thurgadin
that actually has the NPC asking you to retrieve something much harder
by poisoning him with the acid <G>.  I swear I didn't know thats what I
was doing when I gave it to him, but he grew ill and ran off, dropping
the item for the next stage of the quest into my inventory as he fled. 
No faction hit for it, but I was a bit nervous for a minute that his
drinking buddies would turn on me.  The item he gives is the beginning
of the Military Leggings quest, scan for that quest at your favorite web
site for details.
