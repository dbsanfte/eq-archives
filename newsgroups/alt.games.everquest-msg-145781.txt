Hide/sneak works against undead, and also against most things that see
invis.  E.g., the goblin Wizards in Sol have no trouble seeing through my
50+ Wizard's invis, but my 7 Rogue hid/snuck among them with no problem at
all.  When my Wizard had an accident in Lower Guk, my 7 Rogue had no trouble
walking past the undead to drag the corpse out.  The bats in LGuk see
through it, though, so my Rogue got nailed when he went exploring after
dragging the corpse out.
