I can try.  My necro is also an Erudite, who started dubious to nfp.  I
also made a half elf warrior worshipping innoruk, and again start
dubious to nfp, apprehensive to militia.  You should be dubious to nfp
which will let you bank in N. fp.  if you level up, killing orcs as you
see them, you should be able to get where people will be more apt to
sell to you.  You should also be able to turn in belts to both the
warriors and the militia if you fight deathfist orcs in the commons.  On
E. marr it's not that unusuall to find the camp in WC open.

Not sure if you will be kos in Nektulos or not, but you should be able
to do the wine quest in Neriak third gate by the time you get gather
shadows at level 8.  A couple of backpacks and you will be ally to most
non guild hall merchants, amiable to dread guard inner, and i think i am
either indiff or apprehensive with my erudite to dread guard outer now. 
I started as dubious to dread guard inner and outer.  My half elf is KOS
in Nek forest, and as a warrior it will be harder to adjust that up.  I
have been working to ensure i am kos in Rivervale however, heheh.  Save
a wolf from being buggered kill a halfling ;-)

As for pets, most guards don't give two hoots,  Look in WC esp if no one
is killing the guards, you will often see a necro medding up next to his
pet at the guard shack.

The "Scythe" you mention is a Harvester, it's a quest item out of temple
of Sol Ro.  They have also dropped significantly in price, i was able to
buy one for 200pp.  It is a godsend for night blind people like erudite
and humans, as it gives Deadeye as a permanent effect as well as 5 int
and some neg cha.  It however is not a weapon, it is just a held item. 
by 12 I was finding i really didn't melee much anymore anyways.  i might
stand next to pet and get hit to save his arse from time to time, but
actual melee i wasn't doing.  Prior to that i went with 1hb because of
the nice erudite necro only noclin's femur.  Why they made a weapon
obtainable by a non twink at level four not proc til level 10 is beyond
my grasp but, i guess that's part of the "Vision" hehe.  At 16 my necro
is "dual wielding" a Stein of Moggok and a harvester.  I have a dragoon
dirk that someone just gave me in ranged and the few times i have needed
to melee i have equipped it in place of my stein momentarily.  My necro
is more twinked however so YMMV.  My main had bought a GSD for 50 pp and
gave it to an in-game friend who returned it when she got an Oracle
robe.  So that went on my necro.  got a flayed skin cap cheap in auction
that went to my necro.  Did the faction quests with my druid so I could
do the stein of Moggok quest to get one for my necro, so twink on the
necro or not i more than earned that heheh.  My necro just went broke
but from 14 to 16 i fought on sister island in OOT and earned enough pp
to buy my 16 spells and have 150 pp left over which bought me some
flayed skin sleeves.  Since you are human Flayed skin is an option and I
highly recommend the cap, its got both ac and like 4 int,  on Emarr i
got mine for about 175 pp.

And then when you are in the last level before new spells you wonder if
you will ever see a blue pet again heheh.  I think i burned through
about 200 bone chips from 14 to 16.  Being an Erudite however when i
left home i had over 500 bone chips on me.  Kept my stock up by fighting
in Steamfont from 8 to 12, and did some grouping in unrest from 12 to
14, then my shift changed to afternoons, and don't see my regular group
of friends as often, so have mostly soloed since then.

I would say you are not that doomed, but your best spots will be where
you can fight single spawns with a fast respawn time, which is why many
believe necro's to be the best farmers in hte game.  I had a little
trouble in unrest with adds at level 14 which is why i left.  Solo the
yard trash in unrest is just too many adds.  YMMV  If you can have an
area of a dungeon without many adds, then you will be fine, you won't be
able to fear kite, but you have enough other options that it isn't
always necessary either.  I didn't use fear at all from 14 to 16 because
of potential for adds on Sister isle so it's not necessary to use fear. 
When outdoors with little chance of adds i recommend it, but it really
isn't all that reliable til level 12 with the second in the darkness
line.  for an idea though, at level 8 i was fear kiting red pawns at the
chessboard in butcherblock and ending the fight with full health and
usually a bub or so of mana.  I didn't get the harvester or the stein
til level 12 either, so basically at base int.

I haven't been back to g'fay since slaughtering the sisters of erollisi,
so I don't know how my faction with crushbone orcs is, but i imagine
it's probably high enough i can sit anywhere in crushbone and be left
alone.  Also if you want to fight orcs in crushbone to raise faction,
you only lose faction with the dark elf warrior guild which is easy
enough to avoid since they are basically only in their guild hall.  I
skipped this as I hate crushbone.  I find all orc hill does is teach
people to kill steal and whine about others kill stealing, and crushbone
is just more of the same.
