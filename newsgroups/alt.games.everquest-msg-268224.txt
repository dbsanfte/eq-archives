That's why the 4 character limit is so puzzling.  It seems to me they would
want to encourage people who are prone to alt-itis, so as to get them to
spread their time out, and take longer to get to the end of the game.

A friend of mine showed EQ2 to his father, who is an avid gamer.  His father
was quite interested, until he found out about the 4 char limit, and then
that was the end of that.  I asked him if 4 characters would really be a
problem for his father, and he told me that on DAoC, he has hit the 8
character per server limit on almost a dozen servers.  That's almost 100
alts!
