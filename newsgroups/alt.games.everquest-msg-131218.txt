Nonsense. Personally I don't like reading people's WTB port/SoW/rez spam 
in public channels, especially if they send it multiple times in the 
vain hope someone will bite. In my view I see it as they can't be 
bothered doing a "/who" and determining who they could politely ask for 
the favour via a direct "/tell".

Whenever I have needed one, I have had the most favourable responses via 
a simple polite direct "/tell" or a simple "/say" if they are close by.

Unsolicited spam in public channels is worse.
