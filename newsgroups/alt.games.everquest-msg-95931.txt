Actually from what I have seen this is still not clear.
In a group with multiple pets do the pets count together or speratly ?
Do they count each other or not ?

e.g. Necro Necro duo with 2 pets.
Pet 1 does 51%
Pet 2 does 49%

Pet 1 presumably gets PC xp
Does Pet 2 since it out damaged the "group" ?
Or does Pet 1 count as part of the group when establishing if pet 2 gets
xp ?

Alternativly
Pet 1	26 %
Pet 2	26 %
Necro 1 24 %
Necro 2	24 %

Neither pet outdamages the group (48%) but together the pets do (52%)
Do the pets get xp ?

Or 
Pet 1   49%
Pet 2   13%
Necro 1 13%
Necro 2 25%

If pet 2 is counted as part of the group for working out pet 1's xp then
it does not get any. If not then it does.

I think that there is still some confusion here, but it could just be in
my head.

If pets count as part of the group for other pets purposes then
multi-pet groups whould work out much better. If they don't then they
work out much worse.
