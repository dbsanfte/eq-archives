That is not a contradiction again. It's just a hole.

Evolution has moved beyond Darwin. Regardless...

Another possible factor of evolution, proving that the theory is not
in "conflict", it is just evolving.

Wrong again. You simply evolve the theory to account for it.

You have a very limited, very unscientific view of how a scientific
theory works. You seem to think they say one thing and then if it
doesn't work out in every case you simply throw it out and start from
scratch. Very creationist of you. Evolution has proven its worth in
many cases many times. The fact it can't account for everything proves
that it does need further refining. But you also can't seem to come up
with any examples that are actual conflicts, you only hit on ones that
are holes. So once again your claim that evolution should be replaced
is rejected.

And yet you hit all their taglines.
