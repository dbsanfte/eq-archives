Suppose that they *can't* carry around item sets?  For low-level stuff, yes,
you can carry around different sets for different situations.  But above a
certain point it isn't *wearing*, but *ownership*.

Given that beyond a certain point it's magic that's embedded in the item
that gives it the qualities you're after, suppose that those same magics...
interact with each other.  When you're carrying gear appropriate for, say, a
Level 20, the magics in "magic-intensive" gear interact badly with the
magics in "combat-intensive" gear.  The result?  You get all the penalties
from all the equipment and none of the benefits.

Thus carrying a silk BP-equivalent is fine.  Carrying a Plate BP is fine.
Carrying both gives you the penalties from both and the benefits from
neither.  This won't affect the silk shoulder piece... until you pick up
that leather shoulder piece.

(And as you get higher still, destructive interactions would actually
produce *worse* results than simply penalty-no-benefit.  You'd start getting
really bad interactions like curses that stay with you until you ditch one
of the pieces involved.  Similarly, certain pieces might interact
beneficially to produce better results than the stats of the individual
pieces.  Blessings, anyone? {Rod of 7 parts, Cup & Talisman of Al'Akbar...})

You'd still be able to change your character around as desired, but you'd
have to sell off the old equipment before getting any benefit from the new.
Not simply stick it in the bank; actually get rid of it.
