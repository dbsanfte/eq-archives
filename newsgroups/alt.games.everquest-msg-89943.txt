I found that the Voodoo3 does not cut it for a number of places preSoL.
Anywhere on Kunark with trees it just plain sucked.  Anywhere preKunark it
was fine, did have major lag at the EC tunnel, and a few other places when
there were lots of people around.  I went to a GeForce2 MX400, and that
fixed those problems.  In general I would agree with your assessment, but I
would go with more than 512MB of ram if that is an option, it's cheap.
