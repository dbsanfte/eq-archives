At least you are doing your quests.  I cry any time I'm in Sharvahl and 
I see level 1 cats asking for ports to Norrath.

Glad you got so far on your own.  Now go to eqtraders.com and start 
hitting your head against the wall, you got lots of tradeskilling to do. 
  Make sure you look into the progressive tailoring quest, might be a 
good idea to do that while you are trying to find all the other classes 
so you can finish your sonic weapon.  Don't give up!  There are other 
Vahshir out there who need you.  It's just that people get a few levels 
and they start to forget they had this nice quest started.

You are right about the sonic pups, they are a bitch to get the item you 
need.  And you always need to know the status of the war in Hollowshade 
so that you aren't wasting your time going there.

Good luck.
