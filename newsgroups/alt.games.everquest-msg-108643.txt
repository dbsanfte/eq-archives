If I recall correctly, too many on the Evil and Neutral teams objected.
Evil was the bulk of the server population, hence the bulk of the money
income for that server.  They became the squeaky wheel when this was
proposed, and they got their way.

The reason why some Neuts also objected was that some of them wanted to kill
both Goods and Evils, and thus wanted a 'target rich environment'....they
got upset that someone else on the server might be allowed to kill more
players than they could.
