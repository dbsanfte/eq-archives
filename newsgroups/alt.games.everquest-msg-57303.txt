I alt tab all the time, it tricky but if you know windows you can do. It
just takes some figiting. I mainly do it to check up on spells ect while I
have some down times.

You need a window open to refocus the attention of windows, just have
windows exsplorer open (NOT IE, EQ doesnt like IE) then alt+tab will work
fine (with some tinkering) If you alt+tab and surf the web, make sure you
colse IE before you switch back to EQ.


these are the step I take:
before I open eq I open a window thats low on memory (like a dir window)
in eq I just alt/tab out
when done dont alt tab, use your mouse to select the minimized EQ place
holer your mouse will dissapear and if a blank black screen doesnt come up
alt+tab again to get your mouse back and re select the eq place holder

once you get the black screen alt+tab to wouy window then imedeatly a.t+tab
back to EQ and you should be there.

WARNING: when ding this, any typing will be put into EQ as well, so you may
endup broadcasting your credit card over the net >:)
