Being "right" does automatically exclude one from being an asshole. Don't
worry, I am an asshole too, so from one asshole to another Bizbee, relax a
little eh? Grab a beer, a footbath, load up EQ and come over to the light
side : )

Rule books are designed to throw at fuckwits because people in authority
can't very well say say "I am going to kick your ass because your a
fuckwit". Instead now they can just say "I am going to kick your ass because
you broke the rules". Somewhere along the line the rule book got too
complicated and lawyers were invented. Being complete and utter fuckwits
themselves, they naturally started stressing that the rules are more
important than whether a person is a fuckwit or not.

It all went downhill from there...

So, keep in mind, not all people who break the rules are fuckwits, and not
all those that follow them aren't... But rest assured someone who plays a
game with a finger on the page button and the rulebook at hand most proberly
is.

Cheers
