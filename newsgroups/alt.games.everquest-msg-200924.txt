<SNIP>

I have played several MMORPG's to date. Anarchy, EQ, UO, AC...... the
list isn;t going to get much larger because of this kind of behavior.

It runs rampant in every game so don;t think it's exclusive to EQ
alone. I will say that I found more rudeness in EQ than in any of the
others though.

But to be fair, I did meet up with a lot of nice folks as well.

Next game on the rudeness scale is Ultima Online. Some HUGE jerks
reside over there.

Last on the list was Anarchy Online..... Shame the game sucked so
badly. :(
