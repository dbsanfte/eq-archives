You can jump on the "emoticon" bandwagon all you want to, but the fact
is, my original reply to you had everything to do with the GIST of your
post. You know that. I told you that. I was holding you accountable for
what you "ranted" about; something you're obviously not accustomed to. I
think it was pretty juvenile to write that post during a crucial and
emotional period and then expect someone to be a mind-reader instead of
a text-reader. It's very selfish and hypocritical of you to say
 
* Thank god there are still a lot of sensible Americans
* that I've been talking to that I can rant my head off
* too, and they listen and nod and say "there, there". I
* need that when I'm ranting. :) 

and NOT think that there are others who need to hear and feel the same
solidarity you "need". At that time I "needed" to know what your ranting
meant. Now I know.

At the risk of "crashing" your newsreader, I'll say this: I didn't
answer your other reply because I thought you said what I wanted to know
when you wrote:

* My comment was based SOLELY on the fact that it bothered
* me that people were making statements about the US
* saving the world, when many Americans (as certain people
* here have proved) haven't even bothered seeing that it's
* been happening for ages.
*
* It's like sitting at home hearing breaking glass and
* laughter, but not getting out and crusading for more
* police action until a rock comes through your own living
* room window.  I'll still respect you for getting the
* police action in there, but if you start patting
* yourself on the back for 'saving the neighborhood', I'm
* going to have to ask you, if that was your aim, why
* didn't you start when the first window shattered?

You chastised US for our seeming arrogance because of something you
might have heard on talk radio, and attribute quotes from our leaders
that were never made. I know. I taped them. You may have read some
things in this newsgroup and others you feel strongly about, but those
posters are not our leaders. Do you even know when "the first window
shattered"?? Did you put your words into action and go out on a crusade
for the victims? Did you demand that your unprovoked government send
military units into another nation with total abandon to eradicate
Terrorism before it reaches your shores? I don't think so. You armchair
quarterbacked it like the rest of us peons. Yet, you seem to think our
government wants to "save the neighborhood" for some kind of sick glory
all of a sudden. I believe America IS offering to take some "preventive
security measures". Instead of boarding up windows so the rocks won't
come through, switch modes from a defensive "Neighbohood Watch" to an
offensive "Neighborhood Patrol". When the WTC went down, it was a strike
against the whole neighborhood, including your block. 
Your "ranting" will solve nothing.
