Neither.  It means you lack the ability to distinguish between your own
short term predictions of biological necessity and Fox's infinitely long
predictions of political and public will.  To make it more clear to you, I'd
need only to refrain from drinking and coughing for 3 days for you to be
wrong.  Fox would be wrong if the UK joined with America after 10 billion
years.  Surely, he purports to know the future better than you claim to.  It
is his cetainty that makes him a fraud, your defending him that makes you a
fool.
