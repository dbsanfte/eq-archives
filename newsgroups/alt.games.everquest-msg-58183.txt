All I read is you taking a quote from an interview and extrapolating beyond 
reason that it must take that many to run the worlld. My guess is that the 
machines in question are all Intel architecture little Linux boxen running 
behind load balancers with some sort of NAS backend. 

There are other processor families that do those calculations MUCH better 
and faster. SGI has proprietary MIPS processors that would eat all of the 
calculations you mentioned for breakfast.
