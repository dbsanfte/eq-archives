I think it is correct. It meets all your criteria. Its an unneccesary 
convenience for lazy incompetants who can't figure out who someone else 
is attacking. I'm sure if it were removed, competent players would find 
a way to cope, don't you?

Hmmm... who's writing the non sequiturs now?

That I think being able to tell what your targeted on should be obvious 
does not justify a conclusion that I think the whole game be dumbed it 
down to 50IQ halfwits is in order.

How does one accidently attack a mezzed mob? One is standing there 
stunned like a deer in the headlights, the other is rampaging around... 
how precisely, except through poor interface with the game, could one 
make that 'mistake'?

Merely to point out the absurdity, or complaining about the interface 
being to convenient. It was a deliberate non sequitur. I trust you can 
see that.

Knowing whats going on is a far cry from being frustrated because your 
interface gives you very few cues as to what you actually targetted on.

Today's generation thinks games should have more interesting and complex 
challenges then 'what mob have i actually got targetted'.

I'd rather master fighting tougher mobs, with better AI, and special 
abilities then master 'learning to tell what mob I have targeted'.

What sounds like a better game to you?
The one with dumb as rocks mobs, but still challenging because you have 
to master skills like 'targetting stacked mobs', learning where mobs 
warp around or fall of cliffs pulling trains due to pathing issues, 
learning which doors and walls mobs can walk through, etc...

Or one with an intuitive and easy to use interface, but mobs with 
complex AIs, who summon adds, with less predictable capabilities, who 
retreat regroup and return in a logical manner, launch attacks during 
your downtime, raid freeport, target your groupmates using the same 
tactics and priorities you do, who don't run if they're snared, who cast 
relevant debuffs, who can tell if they're outclassed immediately...

I'm happy to grant you that learning what your targetted on is a skill. 
(And one I've got, since you seem to assume that I don't), but so what, 
its not a skill I should need to have. I'd rather have spent my time in 
EQ mastering more interesting challenges than this. And I'm more than 
happy to agree to altering the game so that pointless and stupid 
challenges like this are removed.

You have the gall to criticize my comparison, and then hold this up as a 
better example? I can only assume you are making a joke.
