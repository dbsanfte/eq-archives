 Ive read tons tons tons tons and tons of guides of playing a cleric.i know
what class i want...i know where to put my points ect.....but theres one small
question..and im not trying to be sexist here..but should i play as a
female?..i know there are some male clerics..but like 70% of the ones i see are
female..and i doubt that theres a female pilot behind the stick..also do any of
you guys play female characters?..and vice versa..i know its a stupid question
but id like to know to general census on this..thanks again for your input!
