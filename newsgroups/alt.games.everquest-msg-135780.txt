You will not qualify for a CS resurrection.  CS resurrections are only
provided when related to verified game bugs (zone crashes, Verant's network
going bye-bye, and so on).

The zone being a "bit laggy" does not qualify.  I'm sure you are being
honest, but think of the consequences if Verant said resurrections would
be granted in that situation......
