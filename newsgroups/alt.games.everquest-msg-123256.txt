Years ago I saw a hunting guide for spider silk collection
with exp at all levels.  This was so long ago that "all levels"
mean the first third of the game, up to level 50... but
still, a hunting guide for exp spiders thru 50 would be
great now.

Currently I am looking at dreadlands spiders, who
are blue to me but are turning out to be nasty and
time consuming to solo, what with their spell casting
habits.  Some melee spiders in the low 30s would
be preferable, in order to maximize silk collection
I'd rather chew thru many "not much exp each"
mobs than a few "wow look at that bubble move"
ones.

I did do the "spiders in EK" thing yesterday for a
few hours, collecting over 100 silks, the addition of
the Track skill at 35 made this proposition palatable
for a while, but really I hate farming greenies.

One camp I remember is the LGuk Bedroom,
but of course there I'll have to cope with the
froggie casters.  I suppose I could dig up a partner
or two who don't want silks, LGuk usually isn't
a hard place to find groupers IIRC.

At any rate, any other ideas for silk with exp,
or especially a pointer to that long lost silk
hunters guide, would be appreciated.
