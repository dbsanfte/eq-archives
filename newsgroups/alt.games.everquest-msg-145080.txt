}wolf fang and giant wolf fang but never a sonic wolf guardian fang.  Lastly,
}I have good invis and I have tracking and I have never seen or found any
}guardian owlbears.  Can anyone give me some tips or encouragement towards
}answers?

I see the owlbear guardian talons about once a cave clearing when I'm 
hunting for perfect owlbear pelts... Off the normal mobs (Fleshrenders or 
Razorbeaks, I can't remember...)  I'll bet the staff and fang similary 
drop at the grimling camp and the sonc wolf caves.
