Well, actually, I have a wizard on the test server, who made it to level 11 
in just a few hours /played.  He got exactly zero equipment, was still 
mostly naked.  I might add, that was the first wizard I had ever played as 
well.  It really is trivial to get to level 10 nowadays.  It used to be 
significantly harder.

The advantage I do have is that I have a pretty good idea where and what to 
hunt, and, I know the user interface.  It has nothing to do with equipment, 
although, that would certainly speed things up.

I did manage somehow to muddle through getting several characters above 
level 10, long before I was able to twink any of my characters, and long 
before EQ was changed to become so trivial at the low levels.

With my first character, I drowned because I did not know how to swim, and 
despite reading the manual, was still having difficulty with it.  I did 
manage to figure it out and retrieve all my worldly posessions.  When I 
started a ranger, I died at least twice to falling off of Kelethin.  Back 
then, you had to actually go loot your corpse from the beginning.  You 
started to lose xp to death at level 4.  You had to kill significantly more 
mobs to level through the low levels.
