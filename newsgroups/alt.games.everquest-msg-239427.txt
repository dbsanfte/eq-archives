Congratulations, that's quite an accomplishment for an unguilded person
without even elemental gear. Once the rest of your friends also get
their flags there's a fair number of random named around the zone you
can take down for some nice loot, and there's even a few nice pieces
that can drop from any random mob there.

The trials on the other hand are quite difficult. I hope you have a
necro among your group of flagged friends. The entrance to the trials
zones are swarming with see invisible mobs, making it difficult to make
it to one clothed, much less make it back naked in the event of a wipe.
Many of the mobs also can see through rogue SoS as well. Be very sure
you're ready for a long corpse recovery before attempting your first
trial. One way to make it to the zones is have a cleric da run it with
the rest of the party following. Hopefully any who die will die close to
zone in so the cleric can just zone out and rez after the train
disperses. If you haven't, this would be a good time to build up more of
a reserver of regular experience than you are used to carrying in 65.
