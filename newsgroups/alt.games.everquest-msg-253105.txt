Not being a real Melee at heart, I'm afraid this seems an odd way to 
prioritize.  Maybe its  a matter of definition

Pure Melee
Warrior, Rogue, Monk

Hybrid Melee
Paladin, SK, Ranger, Beastlord (and I suppose Berserker, dunno anything 
about them)

Why would you want to haste the warrior but not the Paladin and SK? For 
the increase in hate production (since the Paladin and SK have much 
better means of hate production)?

Why would you want to haste the Rogue and Monk, but not the Ranger? 
All three depend on melee output as their principle claim to fame...  if 
anything, the ranger more so than the other two because haste doesn't 
affect backstab and monks MIGHT get away with doing mostly pulling, 
depending on your group/raid's strategy.

Splendid
