I am running a Windows 2000 network and recently installed ISA server as a
firewall, this caused major problems. I thought that I had it all set up
correctly, but no such luck. I can connect to the Patch server fine, it is
past that where I run into trouble, meaning that I cannot get it to connect
to a world server or any of the game servers. Has anyone out there
successfully set up Everquest going through a ISA Firewall, if so I could
really use your help as Sony will not support Proxy or Firewalls and I am
ready to pull my hair out. Thanks in advance if you have the solution.
