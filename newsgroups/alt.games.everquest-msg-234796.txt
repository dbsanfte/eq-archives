Congrats.  I got mine a few weeks ago, and zoned in to admire the /con
on the yellow-to-me (at 65) entrance mobs, then headed back out.

Now I just need to find five more keyed people so that I can actually
*hunt* in there...

And to answer the question another poster asked, I could still make good
use of a Primal weapon (for the Avatar proc), which was my main reason
for questing for the key in the first place.
