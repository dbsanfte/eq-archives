Hey all,

Anyone run into this.  We were in BOT last night, figured we would pop
up and play with the Bees.  Shot in via he West Camp and came up.  To
be jumped on INSTANTLY by the guardians.   I had not moved from the
zone in at all.  

Thinking at the time.. maybe I moved into the middle we sent a ranger
up (Who else, its what they do) to grab the bodies.   As soon as the
ranger pops in.. wackage.   

We had all been invisied going up.  Just seemed odd.  Knew they had
fiddled with factions recently, and did not know if this was somthing
related.
