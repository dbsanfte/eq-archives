Personally, I would sell my warriror's epic for around 250k. The green scale
costs around 150k on my server, the spiroc wingblade mq costs around 20k, so
the rest would cover the foot work.

Though I did buy the mq's for the wingblade and the golem ball from fear
(payed 2k) due to me missing a few raids.
