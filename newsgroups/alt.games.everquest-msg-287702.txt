Here is a news about the armory.
In the 3.0.2, The Armory now supports the new Player Calendar, The
Player Calendar allows players to create their own events such as
raids, arena matches, and guild meetings, and keep track of the many
activities in the worlds of Azeroth and Outland.

Every player can access their calendar from the Armory via the new
=93Calendar=94 tab that has been added to character profiles. You can
browse your calendar in the same way that you can in-game. In
addition, you can respond to events through the Armory=92s calendar
interface =96 which will then become effective in-game.
Like guild banks, player calendars are a login-protected feature.
Before you can access your calendar you will be taken to a separate
login screen, similar to the one that displays when attempting to
access Account Management. Enter your World of Warcraft account name
and password in the fields to access the calendars of the characters
on your account. In addition, several changes have been made to the
Armory Login process, including the ability to pin multiple character
profiles.

new armory set.
