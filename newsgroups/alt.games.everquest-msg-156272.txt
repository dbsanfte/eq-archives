So?  Some places can't be single pulled without splitting and
groups without a puller capable of splitting them will pull them
all and use various crowd control methods to deal with them one
at a time.  Lots of the better groups will routinely pull multiple
mobs, for instance, or go to pull another while the first is being
killed.

Many groups have enchanters, for instance, and routinely pull
multiple mobs and have one (or more) parked while they kill one.
And you simply don't wake up mobs mezzed by other groups without
risking being petitioned and having your character warned/banned...
