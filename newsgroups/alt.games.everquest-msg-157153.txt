Something for everyone? This isnt an expansion aimed at everyone. Its
for the end game players. What can a low level character really get
out of this expansion? 1 zone. But theres plenty for lowbies to do
anyways. My only beef about all of this is theres really no reason to
lock features out like the raid commands unless you buy the expansion,
other than to entice everyone to buy the expansion.
