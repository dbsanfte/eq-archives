Did the targeted orc resist the spell?

Mez is considered an attack spell.  If 3 orcs are standing in the
camp, and you cast mez on orc1, orc2 and orc3 will be offended that
you "attacked" their friend and come running.  

If orc1 resists your mez spell, he will realize that he's under
attack, and come running; while calling on help from any nearby
friends.

Harmony is very useful before the pull to make sure only critters
attacked directly join in the fight.  Mez is useful for after the
pull, when you you get 2 or 3 attacking your group; and you need to
put the extras on ice.
