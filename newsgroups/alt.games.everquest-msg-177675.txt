While it's true that there are frequent server-downs, they are also
usually confined to weekday afternoons and evenings, and usually it's
not down all that long (10-20 mins average).  In some ways, these
downtimes are a good thing if you're trying to get a rare spawn that
always pops on a server reset =).   In the past week or 2 I've
outfitted every single character on my account with Fishbone earrings
thanks to the server resets.

As for the rollbacks, I've never had one that was more than 10-15 mins
lost, and even that is pretty rare.

One bad thing about test server, the bazaar sucks.  Very few sellers
and the few there are all WAY, WAY overpriced compared to what you
might be used to on "live" servers.
