For:

1. Level 24 troll warrior. 

Currently : The Overthere hunting MOBs along the shore solo (Can't get a
group). It's doable but rough.

SolA (SolB? The one with the fire goblins...)? Just don't want to travel
there only to find out I can't find a Shaman to group with (For Shrink.)

2. Level 25 Druid to go solo.

Currently: Outgrew Stone brunt.

3. Level 24 Bard to go solo.

Currently in Stone brunt. Will probably stay there for one more level.

I know where I can go, but would like to know here I should go, where
you recommend.

Also, 

:asks reluctantly

What would be the best (fastest) way to earn money with these
characters?

My characters are LONG overdue for some new gear.

Thank you in advance,
jenn
