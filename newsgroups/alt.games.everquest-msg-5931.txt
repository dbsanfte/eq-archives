Maybe a little off topic...

I've never asked for a Sow. Never really want one because I'm a mage and a
SoW makes me outrun my pet which is not a good thing to do in a hostile
environment. Also I can go invis on corpse runs and since I can (now) bind
myself  I should (theoretically) never be too many zones away from my
corpse.

None the less I have been SoW'ed many many times and even tho' it annoys me
I still say thanks. Not for the SoW itself but for the spirit in which it
was given.
