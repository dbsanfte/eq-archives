Thanks for the fond memories Monual. :)  Gaining Cabilis faction and doing
the entire Iksar Shaman cudgel quest was a crowning achievment for my
husband's Vah Shir, and I was really proud that I became non-KOS with
Foxeye a month or so before I quit, thanks to the time I spent in Veksar
(I was non-KOS to the troopers long before that, thanks to killing a lot
of iksar outcasts and gobbies, but I didn't have the fortitude with the
bone-chips to go the rest of the way.)

In fact, between Cabilis faction and my Chardok faction, I'd have to say
that of all my EQ accomplishments, none of them mean as much as the places
my character can walk safely where she shouldn't be able to. :)
