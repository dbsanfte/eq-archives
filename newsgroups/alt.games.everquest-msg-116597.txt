I haven't seen double yet that I noticed. But with my previous level
(29) fire based nuke, my normal max appears to be 250. I had a crit
yesterday for 383. Not nearly double, but not too shabby for a lvl 29
spell.

[Still not using my new 34 nuke. Moved to Vellious. Starting hunting
creatures that live in a permanent freaking blizzard. Scratches head and
wonders why he's getting partial and total resists on almost every cast
of an ICE based spell.]
/sighs and loads up fire based nuke.
