Perhaps you would enjoy a single player game more then.  Why play a MMORPG
if not to share experiences with other real people?

EQ is not fantasy literature.  The players are not fantasy authors and not
restricted by preconceptions of how fantasy characters should speak.

I'm not altering or bastardizing it.  It's been like this since the day it
was released.  For the first six months or so I felt indignant about PC
behavior, but eventually I realized I like what the PCs have done with the
game more than the game itself.

If you don't like the people and the things they say, why do you pay?

Read the definition I posted.  Diminutives aren't based on anything.  It's a
way people convey "youth, familiarity, affection, or contempt".  It's a
widespread practice that's found in all human language.

> Wizzie means *nothing* and the alteration is made *for no reason*.

It's made to convey youth, familiarity, affection or contempt.

I think most of the time it's used to show familiarity.  I think you're
imagining the "ten minutes ago" and "D&D geeky" stuff.

And somehow that's "cool" in your mind, and you hope, in others.  Otherwise
you wouldn't have started this thread.  Likewise, I want to see "cool" by
arguing with you.

Just responding to your cheap shot.  You're implying that I derive
self-worth, identity and individuality from looking and sounding cool while
killing stuff, and that I'm immature because of it.

I've been playing since the day it was released.  EQ has evolved.

I find your belief that it must be enjoyed as it stands unfounded and
impossible.  It's unrealistic to expect 500,000 people not to use
diminutives or create jargon.

I was pointing out your use of a term that replaced another term for no good
reason.

Again, if that's what you want I suggest single player games.
