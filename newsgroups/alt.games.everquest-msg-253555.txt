I tend to concur, except that there are things about FV that are 
different from other servers; principly there's very little thats tagged 
No Drop, and the irritating TLC that they put in Warrens and planned to 
put in SOL is in place, so you have to Raid mode in order to loot 
anything tagged Magic if anyone in your party sees the mob as green.

Its possible (not likely, but possible) that there's some glaring 
exploit thats only available to people on FV due to this rules set.
