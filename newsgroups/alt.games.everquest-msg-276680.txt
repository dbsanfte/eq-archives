That's how life works too you idiot. If I'm a lawyer and I work 100 
hours a week... guess what ... I'm not on the local hockey team, and 
having a fat wallet shouldn't let me buy my way to playing goalie in the 
finals just because I'm too busy and important to show up to practices 
and lesser games.

Set your priorities and live with them.

Read your own post... "What of the person who doesn't have time to grind 
out levels and still wants to play/compete?"

"Competition" was your own contribution to this discussion.

No. Log in and kill some rats in freeport, you are experiencing the 
game. *You* want to experience the endgame without actually playing to 
get there. That's not how games work. Sure its ok to cheat in single 
player console games to unlock the end game stuff before yor rental 
expires if your too lousy to actually beat the game...but that is 
disallowed in multiplayer games for a reason.
