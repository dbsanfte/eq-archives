Ok, The problem is that SoL only installs the zones, as it only does a zone
make-over. Mobs are seperate files, and those that are specific to an
expansion (other than SoL) do not install with SoL, they have to be
pre-installed. I had this problem with Kunark until I got someone to send me
kpatch.exe
