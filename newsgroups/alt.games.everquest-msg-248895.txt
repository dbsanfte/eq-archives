I can't determine if you're a casual player looking to see and feel
more of what the raiding guilds get because you feel you're locked out
of those scenarios by them, or if you're just a phat lewtz whore.

1. Go to Firiona Vie if you want to have lots of no drop stuff as
droppable.
2. People were happy that they didn't include graveyards to GoD because
it removed the risk of death and corpse recovery.  That's what a
challange is.
3. ....Why?  Explain.
4. Every been in a time where you died and there's no paladin or cleric
around for miles who'd come res you, and yet there's that one
necromancer in the corner there...  Still, I see no reason for this. 
Explain.
5. Are you looking forward to EQ2?
6. This would pretty much make this a useless buff line, in my opinion.
As it is, it grants benefit to all classes.  If they changed it to
ATK/Regen then it would probably fall under the same fate as the ranger
spell Force of Nature, which used to stack with Regeneration spells,
but not anymore.  Again, Explain.
7. How long have you been playing this game?  It's been 6 for all that
I can remember, but they included the RAID EXPERIENCE FEATURE so that
players could group up more than 6 at a time.  Players don't do this
often, though, because either they aren't used to using the idea, don't
know about it, or they think the experience spread after adding a 7th
or 8th becomes too great.
8. FEAR THE NEWBIES AND MINDLESS IDIOTS FLOODING INTO THE ONCE PEACEFUL
RAID-REQUIRED ZONES!!  (Gah... if they did this I would rip up my EQ
account and never look back...  Yes, you can have my stuff... oh wait,
it's all no drop)  Seriously.  Think of BoT and what not since they
opened all the pre-Elemental zones and Pre-Sol Ro Tower to everyone
with a proper level.
9.  Would be nice, wouldn't it?
10. ...Why?  You can just do a random adventure, zone in, track for
your phat lewts yielding nameds, and if there are none you can drop the
adventure and pick another one.  People do this all the time.

To the additional note - You want some of LDON and PoP packed into an
expansion because you liked them so much?  Don't you realize that's
what they did with GoD?

Oi... I hope they don't listen to your ideas. -_-
