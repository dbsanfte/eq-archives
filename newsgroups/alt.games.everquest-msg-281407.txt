Yeah, ridicule and swearing is going to help.  There's a game that a lot
of friends are playing, but I can't join them due to time constraints of
building a character.  How does "don't fucking play the game" solve the
problem better than "just fucking buy a character" or "just fucking bot the
boring parts"?  

Here's an alternate response: if you don't like people who play this way,
don't fucking play the game then.

Take the judgemental word "cheating" out and it seems less strange.  Different
people have different opinions on whether reading spoilers, trading equipment
based on non-game factors like friendship or same-player twinking or cash,
botting, sharing characters, two-boxing, etc. are "cheating". 

Does the concept of changing your behavior because you think it'll lead to
more fun seem strange?  It seems like what I recommend to most people
(changing behavior, not "cheating").

My entire point on this thread is that many people complain about "cheating"
for the entirely wrong reasons, and in such a way that it's hard to make any
progress towards an understanding.  Ok, it's Usenet so that's the norm.  But
even so, wouldn't you prefer to identify the causes and effects of behaviors
you don't like, and then work on finding ways to reduce both.
