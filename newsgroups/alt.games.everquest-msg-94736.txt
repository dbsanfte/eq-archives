Just a thought, as I haven't played my gnome necro for a while, but is it
possible to get him to Luclin and actually survive there? Are any of the
zones mainly evil-aligned or is it all goody-two-shoes stuff?

Thinking about it, I imagine casting invis to get to the Spires safely (eg
in NK) would be ok, but can the NPC be hailed safely and will the shard be
handed over? I appreciate that due to a bug you don't actually need a shard
but that'll get fixed in time no doubt. Once in Luclin what about the zones
off The Nexus, are they safe?

Thanks for any info.

Loremaster
