While your version of the test is more valid in the sense of pure Science,
and my version of the test is flawed.....

1) I am not searching for the cure for AIDS.
2) I do not have a gov't grant that will allow me to take the next five
months off of my regular job to test these theories....
3) I would rather spend my EQ time leveling my mains on EMarr rather than
questing with two mules on another server.  (though I am getting attached to
my Magician there, and may keep him...)

What I am looking for is evidence that Charisma might have an influence on
faction gain/loss.

Because I want to get this over with quickly, there are certain flaws in my
test I have to put up with.  It will not be proof.  For absolute proof, I
will either need signed and notarized affidavits from EQ's coding
programmers, or the use of something like ShowEQ.

Even with identical characters, who's to say that one of them killing mostly
snakes and bats to earn his food won't have some unseen effect that the
other character won't experience because he inadvertently killed mostly
large rats instead?

I wanted to make the characters as similar as possible, yet make the
charisma gulf as wide as possible to speed up the testing so I'm not
spending forever on this.  I'm not looking for proof that higher charisma
gives better faction.  I'm looking for evidence that charisma differences
might influence faction.

To be honest, I expect to find, even with the variables of one being a
Magician, and the other being an Enchanter, that there will be no measurable
effect on faction.

I fear that using two Enchanters or two Paladins would have the characters'
charismas too close together, and I would have to have to watch to see when
the Janam and Rebby quests would make them Allied with the Freeport Militia
to come to any conclusions either way.  That would take just too danged long
for the amount of time I have to play.
