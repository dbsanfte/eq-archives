BL could provide the melee of the group ( but Im a bit leary of that
class I smell a nerfing soon), shammy of course the buffs and dots
with some melee, Druid evac,heals and nukes, etc. Think MR buffs a bit
low here though but playing a bard may have warped my thinking :)
Trust me a 150MR doesnt cut it anymore, 200+ seems to be where things
start bouncing off. /em sighs

Oh yeah one more thing, make sure everyone is on the same team, you
will see the reason for that shortly Im sure. One of the only reasons
human teams do so well, no class is closed to them.
