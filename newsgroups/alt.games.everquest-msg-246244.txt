Bah, same goes for sense heading.  Same goes for those of us that lost
experience and had to find our level 8 corpses instead of being able
to use it as a safe method to TL to bind until level 10.

The worst situation for a Necro is being at 25% health and 0% mana. 
It means turning off your massive mana regen and actually having to
med it back like normal people.  Allowing Necros to meditate and
regenerate faster while binding wound?  I gotta see this when I get
home.
