I've had my mend screwing up on me all night!  Mend has always worked so
that the hotkey didn't lighten up until it was ready to use.  All night,
I've had to delay using it because if I used it immediately I would get a
message saying that I have to wait x number of seconds before I can use Mend
again.  This has been as long as 65 seconds!  AND it uses that mend use so
it's not available for ANOTHER 6 minutes.

Has anyone else had this happening?  What do you think, did they nerf the
Mend skill?

Thanks in advance,
