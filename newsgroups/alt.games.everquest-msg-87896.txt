Yep, stuns are NEEDED, some of those sirens hit kinda hard. And that 
nasty charm dont help either.

A level 51 druid, and 2 level 54 wizards did ok at the sirens at the 
zone to SG. I pulled, and the 2 wizzies nuked and stunned the siren. Had 
2 deaths, one of the wizzies got charmed, and my poor druid dont like 
Ice Comet. Got charmed myself too, and they didnt realize that it was me 
nuking, so they didnt run to the zone or tried to stun me before the 
first of them went down.

The swordfish tooth are not so bad as it sounds. We did it 1 group of 
level 52+ people, think cleric, druid, pally, wizard, chanter, monk. 
Main tank level 52 pally.
You start by invissing up to get past the first bulthar, then swim past 
the first 2 seahorses, and past the one guarding inside the tunnel, and 
jump down the waterfall. Get up on dry land and start killing the nearby 
Bulthars and Molkors. Theyre a ok source of gems, and can drop netted 
kelp armor, so should be possible to motivate people to help you. When 
you have cleared the immidiate area, its time for the swordfish. There 
is a little river running from the pool you fell into, down to the other 
parts of SG, one swordfish are guarding that one. And one swordfish are 
swimming from the lake down the river and back again. We just waited 
till that swordfish swam out in the lake, and jumped down and killed it. 
Our group didnt have any problems killing him, had to kill him 3 times 
to get the tooth though. So get a group together and go there, took only 
around 1 hour to get it.


The Kromrif Blood i cant help with, a friend of mine spend a lot of time 
in NFP, and auctioned to buy it when he was auctioning his own stuff. He 
found one for 1K but had to ask me first if i wanted it, and found 
another one fro 900pp before he saw the 1K seller again. Took a few 
days, but seems like its not in the 5K range that EQtraders mention.
And after all the trouble and expense on getting that shawl, 1K more or 
less dont really matter.
