Your other post said "everything has a price" and that's why you wouldn't
take something that was "free".  Yet your examples here are of things where
the price is known, and acceptable to the person giving you something, and
you still won't take it.

This is bizarre on two levels.  First, that you think it even applies to the
question asked, and second that your sense of self esteem or self worth is
so low as to prevent you from taking something that someone wants to give
you out of appreciation.

Oh, a third way, that you somehow felt I was about to argue that the "game
is RL"...   mind boggling.  Next time, take the purple pills, not the blue
ones.
