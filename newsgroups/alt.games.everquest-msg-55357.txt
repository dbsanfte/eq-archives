You piss and moan that your necro doesn't have a lot of armor
selection.  You go on to validate this whining by comparing it to a
warrior.

The point you didn't bother to bring up is that a warrior absolutely
*NEEDS* equipment to be functional.  Not just effective, but
FUNCTIONAL.

Whereas your whiny necro can pop up naked, load up 8 spells, tap a
single decaying skelly for a pair of bone chips and be back to about
75% of the same effectiveness as you were while fully equipped.

You're basically playing probably the single most powerful class as
far as leveling and killing non-end game stuff is concerned.  And
you're bitching about the lack of gear?

Here's the point you seems to be missing:  YOU DON'T FUCKING NEED
GEAR!  You're a necro!  You want gear, buy a few stacks of bonechips.
