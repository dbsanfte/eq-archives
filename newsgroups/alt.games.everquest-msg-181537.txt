Still haven't gotten around to exploring Neriak since the changeover,
but given that I don't recall downloading a new NFQ zone file, I doubt
they changed the physical layout of the zone. There was a lot of
unused space over in that segment of the FQ. Halls, tunnels, etc. Not
many people even know the tunnels were back there because they were
totally empty.
