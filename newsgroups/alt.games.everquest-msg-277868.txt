The numbers on the two EU servers have plummeted. I remember when
Runnyeye was heavy at off peak times and there were 4 Blackbarrows, all
heavy camped. Now it's light at peak times and there are only about
20 people in Blackbarrow at once.

All the movelogs on Runnyeye have contributed to the number loss but I
imagine WOW took a huge chunk. It was released a few months after EQ2
in the EU. I have no numbers but it's not hard to believe many people
would of played EQ2 then switched to WOW once it was released here.

Still, my guide for how the server is doing is "am I still having fun
and are other people still having fun". On that count the Runnyeye
still doing ok.
