I wanted to start this thread to share some knowledge hopefully for some
prime hunting grounds for all to see and hopefully use.....


  Yesterday I played hooky from work (hope my boss doesn't read this) and
was killing Jonah in Lake Rathe with my 16 mage.  Easy kill just waiting the
6 mins between spawns was slow.  A level 16 gnome mage comes in and decide
to take the 2 spawn (aviak guards) island.  20 minutes later he's telling me
the exp rocks but he's having a hard time keeping up.
  Keep in mind that I have killed Jonah 20 times and only have a yellow
bubble into 16.
  I decide to go help him and the guards are RED, yikes!!!  What the hell
I'm bound in the arena.  1 dead red aviak guard, we start alternating the
guards there and the exp is climbing, fast!  I get 17 and log.  Come back
later on and he's 17 and doing the arena off to the side, killing the aviaks
(blue) and the aviak guards (blue to red).  Exp is still coming fast.  He
dings 18 and goes off to kill Cordelia in NK and I take over.  I go from the
side to the cave and keep both spawns under control.  Made 18!!!  I logged
but he came back and said exp is still rocking at 18.
  I know at 19 my druid had a hard time keeping the arena spawn cleared (due
to resists, root breaking), but the mages have that tanking DOT to keep em
busy.


  Where else have you all found to get that boost of exp, even if it's only
really doable by certain characters?  Come on bizbee, Lokari, Jazz  you have
to have some hunting spots you're willing to reveal...
