Hmm, I don't think they mean quit and have to start fresh, but,
rather, cancel, let the account run out, then renew it as a single
subscription account rather than stations pass. Honestly, the only way
you'd be able to quit and start a whole new account would be to buy a
new copy of the game, and I really don't see them making people do
that.
