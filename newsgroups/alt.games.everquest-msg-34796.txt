 And? People who play are simply more than just certain pieces (classes)
that fit to complete a puzzle. If you have 3 monks that want to go to an
event do you tell them "No. Sorry. You don't do as much damage as a
Rogue and we already have 2 of those. Get lost."

 I'm basically tired of all those 'uber' people who claim certain
classes are worthless, or having more than one is a waste, simply
because another class happens to do more damage or can do something
better.  For some, EQ is still about having fun, not just an equation to
figure out which Ubermob_01 can be taken down with the least amount of
people in the least amount of time.
