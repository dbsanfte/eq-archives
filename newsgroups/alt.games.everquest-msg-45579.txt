I am almost certain there are utilities somewhere that you can download that
will disable the windows key, in fact I used to have one on an old computer.
However, after searching for one on hotfiles.com, I couldn't come up with

something would have to come up. . .

P.S. If you have camped pyzjn 4 times (I assume you meant you got the GBS 4
