No, I'm saying that ANY backup heal between the last CH and me going
unconscious, saved my life. It was in reference specifically to the part
I quoted. An anecdote ):oP

We spent a few Emp runs learning the most efficient way to control the
adds, and a few runs 'pulling', and a few runs finding out the best
placement. Once that was all set, our first real attempt got emp to 90%,
next attempt got him to 60%, and our last attempt was an infuriatingly
close sliver of red. IMO, if you can get Emp to 60% legitimately (ie:
not MB/disc/hoop zerging) you can kill him with the same strat. We
lacked DPS last time, so that sliver of red took us nearly an hour of
fighting. Wednesday, he dies!

I've tried the poos (snare I assume? not stun) but didn't find them too
useful. Starting off with bane2h, then switching to hates seems to work
best for me, but other warriors in the guild prefer doing it their own
way. Taunt is such a fickle beast, I'm sure a lot of it is just the mob
feeling the confidence in a warrior hehe.

eeewww... cheesy ):oP

But they wouldn't do as good a job. It's like saying if we had enough
druids spamming heals we wouldn't need clerics.
