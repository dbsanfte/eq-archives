Cloak of the Ry'gorr oracles 10 cold, 5 magic
Shroud of nature 8 fire/cold
Crown of froglok kings 20 fire/cold
Rough silver chain necklace 5 sv all
Sarnak Battle Shield 10 fire/magic/cold
Diamond Wedding Band 8 fire/cold
Grey flesh gloves 10 cold
Ceremonial smudging stick 10 magic/fire/poison

All of these are either soloable, groupable, or less than or equal to 1k in
price if you shop around a bit, at least on my server.

My resist setup is at http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=120528
I had approximatly the same resist numbers when I did Vox a month or two ago
at 52
resisted all but one Dragon Roar (fear), (magic based), partially resisted
all AoE's with max dmg being in the 300-400 range I think.

However, I did have Circle of Summer up (45 more cold), group resist magic
(55 more magic) and I *think* bard resist songs for the fight
