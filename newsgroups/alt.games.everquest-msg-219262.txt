Parry, Dodge, Rioposte.   Thats 15 or 20 precent right there.   Perhaps I'm
twinked, perhaps not, but I generally have more hit points and armor class
than the shamans I group with.   It also allows them to cast without
interruption.

And if things get out of hand, "/disc counterattack"

I'm not including stoicism, as it should not be used in this situation.
Just losing the backstab would be enough.   In a recent parse (of a small
amount) over 35 percent of my total damage was generated by backstab.


*shrug*   I guess tanking comes naturally to me after so long.   All things
being equal I'd much rather be getting hit on than the casters. If the tanks
are dead, I'm the next line.
