I am pretty open-minded about it.  My initial post was mainly relaying the
first few posts I saw at monkly-bus refering to it

The general beef with it though, I guess, is most pulls are "tricks", and as
such these tricks may become totally useless - having to devise plans and
re-learn every pull would surely be a nerf that monks felt the brunt of

Btw not all bad pathing is a bad thing..  it should be all but impossible to
die in PoH second floor with the pathing there!
