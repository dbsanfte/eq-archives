Hmm. So who said monks were intended to solo these things? They're a
group class now, as was intended in the beginning, and I guess people
just have to get used to it. Would you expect a 60
warrior/SK/pally/ranger to solo these mobs? Of course not, though I
suppose it could be done with the right gear. The people who play
monks have slowly had their expectations scaled up over the past 3
expantions, and now those expectations need to be lowered.
