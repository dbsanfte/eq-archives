A little of both.

Your perspective is off base in that you're thinking Thurgadin quest armor
was the best of Velious.  It was the middle velious armor.   Skyshrine /
Kael quest armor is the good Velious armor.

But a lot of what you said still holds true even when you look at the "good"
stuff.   Droppable bazaar gear outclasses all of it, in some cases very
cheaply.  That is mudflation in action.
