I've found the Dawnshroud Peaks to be excellent for mid 30s. You can sell
here, or you can run over to Sanctus Seru which is connected to this zone,
and that will provide you with merchants and a bank.

Almost everything in DSP will be good exp for you, except for Rockhoppers
which are for the 40-50 area, and tend to stay in their cave unless trained
to the zone.
