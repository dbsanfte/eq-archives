Tradeskills are for color. Almost everyone mentions that it
costs a lot of time and money and there's little in the way
of a PC market. Although banded armor can be sold, though
probably not for much in the way of profit.

I like tradeskills though, my rogue will do ceramics and poison
making and my shaman alchemy but these are class skills and need
both levels, cash and components. And the products have fairly
obvious in game uses.

I've seen people RP very well with cooking and brewing. A caster
used to give us all cookies after a tough battle which just 
seemed so cool. Meanwhile a troll chatting about his latest
recipes almost had me going green. And needless to say practicing
your alcohol tolerance with a dwarven brewer is something everyone
should do once....though not on kelethin.
