OK, I fell for it .... followed the link and yes, it does take you to a game
site ... a game that works like a pyramid scheme ...

The first paragraph of the FAQ reads as follows:

" I have created my character, now what do I do?  The first thing you need
to do is send your secret link to as many people as possible.  The more
people that click on your secret link, the more money your character will
generate per turn."

Guess what kind of link that is in the original post?

Then, if someone creates a character after following that link, they become
a "second level referral", and you get credit for every 5 people that click
their link.

Just felt everyone should know.
