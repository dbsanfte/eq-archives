That's it exactly.  The shaman was just "buffing" a friendly mob that
was within range.  The shaman was also out of both *assist* range
(where it will help friendly mobs which are attacked) and *aggro*
range (where it would aggro itself.)   The "buff" range is bigger than
both.  The shaman didn't get aggro passed (which is the assist range),
he just thought he was "buffing" a friendly mob which needed it.
Caster mobs usually spawn, buff themselves, then have fun buffing
all mobs within its buff range.

You can see the same thing if you play a class with feign death:  if
you pull a mob well away from any others and feign, the mob will
wander back to its spawn point (eventually), and any healer mob
will then heal it, even though its clear the mob no longer has aggro.

It's fairly obvious to anyone that plays the game that the maximum range
on beneficial spells is well under the maximum aggro and assist
ranges.  In general, "buff range" > "aggro range" > "assist range."  And
"follow range" is bigger than all of those, of course.
