It's not as simple as that. There is a "hand-shaking" process that
goes on between network devices. When your client side patcher
requests a file from the sever, each packet is checked and verified
once it is recieved. If a packet is dropped or corrupted then your
client will ask for it to be resent.

If the server  stops "shaking hands" with your client, the patcher
program may desperately try to re-establish the link. This could mean
flooding your ISP connection with requests and sending your CPU
utilization through the roof.

Since your problem seems to happen with the same file, I would suggest
deleting, renaming or moving that file in order to force a fresh
download. This might be enough of a jumpstart to get past the problem,

Cheers
