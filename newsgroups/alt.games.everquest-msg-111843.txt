I was sort of indifferent to the ending.  I did think Kevin Spacey was very
good in it.

It was a happy movie, and is one of my personal favorites.

I had avoided seeing it for a long time, but when I finally did, I loved it.
I was sort of half watching it while I played EQ... when it caught my
attention a few times.   By the end I was really into it.... and when it
ended, I flipped to the west coast movie channel and waited an hour for it to
be replayed.    I think I may have even logged out to watch it ; P   Well,
either that or found a place to work on tradeskills or some such non-attention
intesive thing.
