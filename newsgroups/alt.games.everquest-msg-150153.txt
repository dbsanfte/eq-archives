I can't think of any advantage to binding on top of the spires
instead.  You'd still be in aggro range of the dwagon, but
would be much further away from the nearest escape... which
would be running for any firepot!

Personally, when I bind there its right in front of the Felwithe pot,
since thats the one closest to a nexus port.  If I pop in to
a dragon, I can just run forward one step and I'm out of there.

Not that its ever happened to me, spawn Fay is very rare and
quite short lived.
