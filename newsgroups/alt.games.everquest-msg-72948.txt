3 points into run speed, ASAP.
This is mostly great if doing Luclin, far too many areas are "indoors"
and grouping there sow will run out. 3 points is a noticeable
difference when you have to run. I'm a 55 druid and thats the first
thing im putting points in. The next 3 don't really matter.. then as
soon as I can I'm adding 3 mana regen points in 55, which of course is
the best upgrade there is.

The stats just dont help much, faster innate run with no spell on
will.
