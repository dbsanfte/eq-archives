The only real difference between a small and large sewing kit is the number
of slots they hold: small has 2 and large has 8. Small kits are also much
lighter than large (0.8, I think, as compared to 3.0) You may see "deluxe
large sewing kits" which have 10 slots; these are the remains of a brief
period when large kits had 10. These so damaged the market for tailored
backpacks that large kits went back to 8. Rather than have people loose items
that might have been in the extra slots, existing ones were altered before
the new large kits were added.

With all this, you are better off buying a large kit if you can afford it.
One of the early recipes has you combine three silk threads to make a silk
cord (which is used in making bags a bit latter) and you can't do that if you
just have two slots. However, a small kit will do you well enough through
patchwork into some pieces of raw silk (patchwork armor is just a ruined pelt
and a pattern; some raw silk items are just one silk swatch and a pattern),
and can be convenient when you are hunting spiderlings and spiders (the silks
do not stack; silk threads (combine two spiderling silks) and silk swatches
(combine two spider silks) do.
