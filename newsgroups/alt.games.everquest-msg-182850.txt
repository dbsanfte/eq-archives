It doesnt' matter. If you use that response, it will just immediately be
followed up with claims that you all have no life, dwell in your
mothers' basements, etc. etc.

But out of curiousity, perhaps you'd care to share. How *do* you get an
Emp killing force online by noon every time the servers go down.
Assuming the "no life" thing is not the actual truth, most of us have
jobs. That's quite a trick to manage.

And don't you have any Euro guilds on Prexus?
