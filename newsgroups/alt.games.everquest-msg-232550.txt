Shaman never get any high-HP heals. :p 

As to which is the better healer, it depends on the situation. A druid
is much better at healing NOW. Their quick heal heals about 40% more
in the same time frame and their best iCH heals for 5k as opposed to
2k for a shaman. 

Shaman are better if Quiessence is enough to keep up with the majority
of the required healing, which basically limits it to mobs that max
out at around 300DPS unslowed and are fully slowable.
