If I see someone fighting and they aren't /yelling for help, even if
they're fighting more than one mob, I will always ask first if they
need help before joining in.  One time in Field of Bone I see a player
with two wolf hunters on him and I asked him if he needed help; he
said, "Naw, I have a high level druid nearby" so he was actually
pulling multiple mobs on purpose to PL.

Of course I don't think a player would mind if you heal them during a
fight, unless you're that guy who plays the Iksar monk that doesn't
like magic! :-)
