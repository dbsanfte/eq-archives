I just went back and read a post that someone left concerning their missing
account.  They mentioned that they pay with a debit/check card.  I was
wondering how that was setup.  I looked on the web site and see nothing
remotely close to it.  I haven't been on EQ in a while and had to reload it
after I deleted it a while ago.  I tried to sign back up and was only given
the option to use a credit card.  Did I miss something or is there another
way to make payment that I may have over looked.


TIA
