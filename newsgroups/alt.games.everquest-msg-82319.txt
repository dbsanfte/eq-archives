believe its dex or agl over cha.  makes absolutely no sense for cha to be
secondary skill.  dex or agl makes alot more sense.  not even sure how
valuable or useful buffing these skills would be though.  INT is probably
the single most important stat for trying to increase JC.  If your using WIS
instead of INT, you probably shouldn't even be bothering with JC except
maybe for some stupid quest, like the 7th shawl.
