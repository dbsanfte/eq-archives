Definately disk problems. I'd still run checkdisk overnight with the
surface scan option. It will mark out bad sectors you may not have
isolated with your rename trick so you don't get the same problem in the
future. I'd run it weekly and if more sectors show up bad I'd start to
think about replacing that hard drive before it fails completely on you.
