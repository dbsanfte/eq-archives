The manaburn nerf affects only groups with more than one wizard.  Normal groups
contain no more than one of any given class, the odds of 5 man groups out there
with one wizard looking for second wizard are particularly low.  I suppose that
situation is marginally rarer now than it was before, since MB doesn't stack
anymore.

MB is not a particularly good AA for group action anyway.  Shoot all your mana
in one big inefficient blast.  What happens when the next mob shows up?  Wizards
in normal groups spend hours killing one mob after another, not boom, one mob,
ok, let me leach off you for the next couple hours till I can MB again.  And
they don't stand up, kill mob instantly, then loot up and leave the group.

MB was nerfed worse by the Mod Rod nerf than by the "no stacking" nerf;
previously a wizard could drop all his mana inefficiently at beginning of a
fight, then mod back up to full mana and start nuking normally.  This added
significant damage to his "burst" output on mobs that take a couple minutes to
kill.  As it stands, MB is only useful for mobs where there is an immense hurry,
since it shoots your mana quickly... if you have a couple minutes its now better
in most cases to just nuke normally for higher efficiency.

The group that MB stacking nerf affected most is "team manaburn".  A group of 6
wizards could blow thru all their mana so quickly that they could reliably cause
certain mobs to go from full health and unengaged to dead without any period
where they had a chance to summon, bite, nuke, or otherwise bother the team.
This only worked on a few "interesting" mobs, though, and while it was a team
activity, you'd hardly call it grouping, more of a special event.

Grouping multiple wizards does give you one of the most powerful group actions
in the game; its not via MB though.  There's another curious little operation
called PBAoE.  Here, you gather together large quantities of mobs, pack them in
tight, and then use spells that do massive damage to ALL the mobs at the same
time.  Wizards are ideal for this as they have the highest PBAoE damage output,
plus spells that help pack the mobs in tight.  If you want multiple wizards to
be desirable for groups, this is the ticket, not MB, killing 30, 40, 50 or more
mobs in the mana an ordinary group might use to kill 8 is... very attractive.

PS HT tickles the mob slightly.  MB does about 10 times the damage a comperable
level SK HT does.  Group 60 SK and whack Gorenaire in an instant and I don't
think anyone will really be impressed.
