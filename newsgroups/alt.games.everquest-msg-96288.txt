Good idea, I have 10k sitting the bank doing nothing with nothing to spend
it on.

No seriously, I HAVE 10k in the bank with nothing to spend it on, had
thought of a couple BP's but I rarely use 1hders...still a thought tho'
Can't actually afford any better armour with it, my helm is my current weak
spot but I have seen anything worth the money over my 20pp SSB :�)

Do I really want a horse that is only as fast as Jboots tho? Seeing as my
other character (second PC and Account) is a Druid so movement isn't really
a problem...hmmm..they do look good tho'
Prolly not come to think of it, I could really do with a haste item that has
some decent AC on it...guess I need to save a bit more :�)
