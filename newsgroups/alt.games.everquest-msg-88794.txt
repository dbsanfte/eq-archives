Reminds me of the guy I saw in Oasis last night. A guild had arranged
a buff station at the dock, and was shouting about their free buffs at
irregular intervals. In the middle of this, a level 17 druid (with a
dr00d type name) logs in and starts auctioning 'buffs for sale at
docks'... Later, I saw him say to someone that he needed food and
water before he could buff. I presume that his character was starving
and that he hadn't figured out what 'forage' was for.
