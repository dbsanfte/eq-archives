Well that's what I'm not saying, I was actually a major Ultima fan, I
played Ultima's 1 to 8 many years ago, and I adored every little bit
of it, and Ultima Online is, for me, the epitomy of all things Ultima.
It's one big nostalgia fest for me, from the sound made when backpacks
are opened, to the familiar cities and locations I visit (I found
Empath Abbey and though "It's exactly how I left it").

To me Ultima wouldn't be Ultima without that viewpoint (that's why
Ultima X hasn't grabbed my interest, as it has an EverQuest style of
first person gaming, and even the old Ultima Underworld 1 and 2 didn't
seem entirely like part of the series).

EQ has always been, to me, a game which centers entirely on levelling
up. Everything from people to places to equipment seems to be there
entirely to boost your stats, and all I ever seem to do is wander
around killing things in an effort to level up.

Ultima Online so far seems very well rounded, as I'm now playing a
blacksmith character, and I make money by taking my pickaxe and
hammer, finding ore, smelting it, and then using the ingots to make
weapons, which I sell. When I'm bored, I find a pub, change my clothes
into something casual, and get my character drunk.

I never got that level of variety when I played EverQuest. I admit I
will miss the rain and fog effects, that came into play once I got a
decent video card, but I won't miss going on there and having to think
"Where's the nearest 'yellow' creature"
