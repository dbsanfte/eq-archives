Aye. Highpass would be perfect. I'd be surprised if you didn't have 10
tells the second you zoned in and shouted lfg. At 19 you can even
sometimes skip the pass and move right inside to the keep. Any group
working the pickclaws without a real cleric would snatch you up like
candy and since the mobs there are all red to you, the exp would be
phenomenal.

LoIO also good. Although one might consider Kurns Tower in FoB a more
effective locale for a cleric.
