Yes... if it weren't for Kunark, I'd have "won the game" tonight and I
could move on to Star Wars Galaxies, or DAoC or something. But, of
course, by the time I (if/when) make 60, they'll have added another ten
levels with the next continent expansion after Luclin. Damn you Verant!
DAMN YOU!!!!!!!!

(Please insert appropriate irony emoticon above for those who realize
that you don't "win the game" at any level and I'm just busting balls
and happy as a clam.)

Yes, there was no reason for this post except for some silly, still
essentially newbie, wannabe uber dickwaving. Oh... that and a reason to
use my new sig line.

Well, ok. Also to say that Orlun also made 50, and Tiru is about one or
two play sessions away from making 49, where we'll get 90% xp rezzing,
and then the whole of Norrath's mob population can just kiss our asses.
MUA HA HA HA!

CRAP! I just realized, I have 1.9999 levels left to kill Vox, or I'll
never be able to say I did it!
