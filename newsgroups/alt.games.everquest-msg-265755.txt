Ah, calm down a bit please. This started as a good and interesting
discussion unless you jumped each others throats. :)
To get back to the point I want to say that "content" doesn't solve your
problems. Just run through old world and make a /w in each zone you pass
through. Most of the time a normal LDON has more people in it. :/
You can't argue that there is no content in these zones. Unless you
define content as synonym to available loot. And from your response to
42 I know you don't do that.
So the question is how do you make content attractive? The thing that
instancing adresses is camping imho. I especially like the idea proposed
by 42 in which the named is instanced in a pocket zone. EQ2 did that on
the island with the mob for the last class quests. Even though the
island would not count as dungeon ;) you have to reach a certain spot
where a door lead to a small room with the boss and its minions. You can
have all the ooc spam you like until you enter the mini zone. Then it's
your group against the boss. And for me this did not kill immersiveness.
On the contrary!

You can't be serious here can you? Casual gamers and raiders usually
don't share the same zones. So how could anything that caters to the
casuals even affect the raiders? Honestly I can't see your point here.
