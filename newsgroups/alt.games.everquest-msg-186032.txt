Perhaps the increased player base is in spite of the porting.  I certainly
makes getting around easy, but seems a little artificial.  I need either 7
or 11 more levels before I can even start getting gates to specific
locations.  But that's not really a concern, because any newbie can now go
and touch a book and go just about anywere.  My wizard is pissed. ;-)  I was
in BB the other day, and newbie was calling for a gate to some location.  A
level 51 player says meet me at the book pedestal near Kaladrim.  I don't
know if he was going to show the newbie how to use the book, or actually
gate him somewhere.  Of course the newbie may not have had PoP.

I guess what it comes down to for me is, I don't have to use all the new
feature, just the one's that make the game better for me.  If I what to
travel the old fashioned way, I can do that.  If I want to take my time
leveling, and just enjoy the game at my own pace, that's fine too.  In
general, hunting the old areas is easier, because there is less competition
outside the camps.  That works for me.

Cheers,
Eric
