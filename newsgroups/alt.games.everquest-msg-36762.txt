I had a problem with a SB Live! and here is how I fixed it:

In the Win2k hardware settings there is a slider for "acceleration".  I set
this from 100% to 75% with no luck.  Moving to 50% gave me all of the EQ
sounds.

Before I did this I had some basic sounds, now I get all of the ambient
sounds as well.  Much cooler.
