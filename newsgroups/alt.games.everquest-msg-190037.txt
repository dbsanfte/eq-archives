IMO Ivy Etched isn't worth the gems it costs to quest it.  And no, you're 
not going to find the gems dropping anywhere a level 30ish can hunt.  At 
least on Karana you can pick it up in the bazaar for quite a bit cheaper 
than the cost of the gems.

You should probably re-analyze your stat priorities a bit in the near 
future.  Heading into the 40s your role in groups is going to change from 
"can tank okay" to "can we get a *real* tank now?"  Having a ranger tank 
just isn't generally healthy for the cleric's mana bar.
