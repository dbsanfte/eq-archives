Everybody has been saying the shaman-monk, cleric-warrior combinations
worked the best, but I have a shaman, a cleric, and a 4 monk. :P  I've
done alot of duo-ing and I've found the opposite.  

Shamans and warriors definitely kick an amazing amount of ass working
together.  Warriors may do a little less damage than monks, but they take
less damage.  Shamans can boost that damage output through dots and
str/dex etc buffs, but have less healing.  Monks give plenty of damage,
but seem to take more.  The cleric has more healing to back that up, and
has the stun spells to keep the mobs from dishing the damage.

Through personal experience I'd have to say monk - cleric would work better.
