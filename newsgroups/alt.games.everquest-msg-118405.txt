Well, I do give you points for originality. It's still bullshit,
though... If it really was your daughter, she sure as hell didn't have
the "poop" scared out of her. Someone who's had the "poop" scared out
of them doesn't spend days making posts taunting those who "scared the
poop" out of them before running bawling to daddy.

Nice try, jackass. No one's buying it.
