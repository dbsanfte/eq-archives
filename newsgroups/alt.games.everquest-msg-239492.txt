You need to be able to kill hundreds if not thousands of undead
frogloks (level 30+ in Lower Guk) or Sebilis frogloks (level 40+ in
Old Sebilis). And then you need a nodrop item from level 55+ frogloks
in Sebilis. So no, you can't do it at level 12, unless someone high
level is willing to help you kill all those frogloks.
