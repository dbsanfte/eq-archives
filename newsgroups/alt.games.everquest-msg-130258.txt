let's assume it isn't a full power outage.  only my house is affected,
not the local cable nodes.  let's further assume that the PC is on
a UPS, but the cable modem isn't.  if the power outage is brief
(say, no more than 10 seconds), will my connection be maintained
when the power (and thus the cable modem) comes back on?

in other words, if i'm playing everquest, will the game continue
as normal after the power comes back on?  or will i have to log
in again?
