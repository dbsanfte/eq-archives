Ok, your rant over, Dr. Normalcy?  Thanks for your psychoanalytical
viewpoint of me, describing me in the third person.
You do realize there are subjects you can SKIP right?  If you don't want to
read the damned thing, shaddap and skip it!

Your post was nothing buy Ad Hominem; there wasn't one iota of helpful
advice.  I do honestly thank the few who took the time to read my venting
and suggest help.  Some people who are disturbed about things go postal,
some just sit and fester, some vent and rage.  I was bottled up, as one
poster here suggested, and I popped the damned cork.

I will indulge you by going off on your suggested tangent, because yes I am
bored this evening as you have so cleverly observed:  My usenet history?  I
have some usenet history, not too much because I used to have a life instead
of sitting around playing online games and reading the newsgroups associated
with them.  But usenet is refreshing and eye-opening because quite a few
dregs of humanity hang out in them, flaming and criticizing others' lives
instead of offering suggestions and help, as a few good people here have
done.

This was not a troll posting.  It was a true story.  Call it sad, pathetic,
lonely, call me whatever you want, I've heard it all.  Your reply, however,
was vile and contemptuous, but usenet takes all types.
