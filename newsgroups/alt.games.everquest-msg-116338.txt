Funny thing, another thread right above yours is titled "making money"

HG drop on average 15pp.  If you can kill them in 3 or 4 whacks, take no
damage, and go on to the next, you can literally pull down 3Kpp in an
evening's work.

Contrast this to killing mobs in Skyfire, which takes some actual effort
and down time, and nets you an average of 3pp per each.

While there are some better ways to make money, they often involve getting
a group together and going somewhere that takes some time and effort, and
commitment.  Farming HG, you can log in, kill as many as you like all by
yourself, and log back out whenever you need to, without any of the irritation
of forming up a high level group.  Its not a bad use of time if you only have
an hour or two to play, particularly if you have short times several days in
a row (say after getting home from school or work... and real play on the
weekends)
