I wouldn't assume that's his real name as I'm sure he's petrified of what
would come of an actual issue...

I guess I could have played along and gotten his real name...address...phone
number...etc but he's just really not worth my time..

absolutely sickening that he stooped to real world stuff like this after
he's bitched and whined about just the opposite and even accused me of
trying to get real info on him and berated me because of it...

fucking hypocritical scumbag stalker...i oughta call the fucking cops...
