Thanks for your time and input in answering.  I've played 3 characters now
in just a few short months. This is giving me a lot of learning and
understanding, but, obviously, I'm still a long way off learning the
subtleties of the game. I find that if I start to thing about rolling a new
character I put a lot more time in learning it's capabilities before I just,
jump it and find out later I made a mistake based on the type of game play
I'm looking for.

Again. Thanks to all for your time and feedback.
