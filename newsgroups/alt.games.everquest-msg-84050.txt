  You didn't specify.  I've never heard of Verant "kicking out cash"
to anyone, and if they did so, it was in the dark and distant past,
perhaps before they had a huge established customer base that they
knew would endure continuous lapses in customer service.  I have been
an on and off customer of Verant's for over 2 years now, and I never
once have known them to begin to compensate for an interuption in
service, no matter how severe.

  As I said, monentary compensation is not the ONLY way they can
apologize for the flaws they introduce in to the system and the
substandard service.  I barely even care what form the compensation
takes, I would just like for Verant to acknowledge every once in a
while that "yes, we screwed up, and here is what we're doing to fix
it, here is why it won't happen again, and oh, here's a little
something for the trouble."  Not every unexpected outage, bug, class
imbalance, nerf, snafu, or whatever, has to be (or should be) result
in direct compensation, but in the case of very extreme lapses, like
the Luclin release fiasco, some sort of bow of apology would be
greatly appreciated, at least by me.

  Instead I'm left feeling as if the mess has already been forgotten
and barely even regretted, and when it comes time for the next
expansion, or when it comes time to unnecessarily convert the game
engine to DX9, we'll run into lots of the same problems and once again
the only apology we will get will be "We're sorry about the
inconvenience this might have caused you", while thousands of players
are left without service (or service which vitally lacking somehow),
waiting hours to be told by Tech Support to send 4 files to a certain
email address.  With no compensation, not one penny of credit, not one
sliver of experience, not even a single apology with a note of
personal sincerity to it.

  But, whatever.  They're running a business and there's no law saying
they have to provide quality customer service.  They have created a
reasonably entertaining game that's still the king as far as content
and gameplay go in this particular arena, and for that Verant deserves
praise, and that praise I give them.  I do not praise their customer
service, which in my experience has been uniformly poor and I'm not
ashamed of being vocal on that subject.  I will praise Simutronics'
customer service, because in my several years of patronage of them,
they have seldom disappointed me with their service.  I will offer
limited praise of Mythic on their customer care because I personally
see their gesture as kind, considerate, harmless and novel way to give
back to their customers for a lapse.  I think Verant could learn
something from these other companies, but until they do... oh well.

  What you call "pandering to the unwashed" I suppose I would call
"soothing upset customers [who ostensibly play EQ to relax and enjoy
themselves]".  I'm not sure what you mean by "integrity" in this
context... but I fail to see how Mythic's actions in this particular
instance particularly upsets their "integrity".  What you call "a
short term solution" (making your customers happy), I call good
business policy and just a nice thing overall.

  I'm not going to waste anymore time rambling on the subject as I
think I've said just about everything I can say at least twice.  Feel
free to carry on with the vitriol.
