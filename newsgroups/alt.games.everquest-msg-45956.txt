I'm not calling them morons or anything but my T1 line never goes down. The
recent rash of disconnects is on their side...This may have something to do
with NY,NY and all the repairs and clean-up after the WTC disaster. I seem

what possible valid reason would they stop showing us the server count? I
used it all the time to decide which server to play on. Just one more reason
to actually switch to another online game, bugs or not.
