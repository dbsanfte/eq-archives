You know, I'm getting kinda cheesed off with this. Not so long ago it was
suggested that Wizards might get a customizable graphical display of our
Familiar's, after all they're very boring to look at. Verant themselves
answered us by stating that there was no more room to tinker with additional
alternate forms of character or buff, yet as soon as they've dismissed the
idea out-of-hand they give Enchanters another illusion.

Not only that, it seems that Mages will soon be able to self-gate and whilst
this is great for them, again it leaves me annoyed that we Wizards have to
take the back seat. So far as I'm aware all pure casters have pets that can
fight all day long (light blues) gain experience and accumulate loot. My
example, let's say my 60 Wizard is running short of cash (as he often
does) - remember I have to buy Peridots to self-shield as I have no Epic. I
head to Rathe Mountains, fight three or four Hill Giants then am faced with
sitting on my ass medding for 15 minutes, whilst all other pure casting
classes have their pets that they use, this pet being well able to solo mobs
with little damage taken, thus no down-time at all for those casting
classes.

Looking at the known list (and yes, I realize that these will change) of
Wizard spells coming out with PoP I'm left feeling rather sad at what's
coming my way. It looks very much as if the Enchanter will be the true ruler
amongst classes!

What did Verant do for us Wizards? They reduced the casting cost of the
Sword of Xuzil to 250 .. gee, thanks Verant! What did Verant do for
Enchanters, give them the chance to attain Dire Charm so they can fight all
day without down-time, give them KEI so they can sit on their asses getting
rich selling it all day, which is a good causing for the Enchanter to be
smiling all day! Way to go Verant!

Kind regards to you all ...

Stevie.
