All the points you raised are valid (which is why I didn't snip
anything) but you're ignoring the main advantages of off-tanking if
you happen to have a plate tank, shaman or necro in the group. I'm
assuming that you have someone (even a monk or ranger) to act as main
tank. 

In my experience, the main mob doesn't die appreciably slower if you
have one person offtanking, I'm usually talking about a low DPS class
like pally, sk or shaman here. If you have DoT classes, they can
actually increase their efficiency by a good bit. They can use their
clicky dots like shaman and druid epics, They can use AA abilities
like spirit call or that necro corpse reanimation AA (useless against
mobs that die in under 45 seconds). Druids and mages get more mileage
out of their damage shields. The enchanter can use his mana for DDs
instead of mez, one that I group with crits for 2600 pretty reliably
which is a helluva lot more than my shaman will ever do.  

You skip all of the inate problems that come with mezzing mobs. There
always seem to be a couple of mobs in every dungeon that are pretty
highly resistant to magic. That means on a few pulls your enchanter is
gonna get beat on pretty hard while he gets an add under control
(might even die trying). 

Even more important, breaking Mez is always a problem. Not many groups
are smooth enough to have a mezzed add rooted and ready for killing as
soon as the first one is dead so you loose a couple of seconds before
you start killing the 2nd mob. If you don't want to root before
breaking mez, chanter has to use mana to lower himself on the hate
list or you spend precious time taunting before breaking mez. Even if
you do root before mez breaks, given all of the procing weapons and
pets out there these days there's no guarantee that the mob still
won't be chasing your chanter 2 seconds after you wake it. 

Obviously, that last paragraph doesn't apply if you have a Bard
mezzing. 

I'm not saying that off-tanking is always better, you pretty much need
a good slower or a beefy tank with a serious damage shield to make it
worthwhile but don't dismiss it out of hand. 

.... plus, having multiple unmezzed mobs in the camp is more fun! <g>

Rgds, Frank
