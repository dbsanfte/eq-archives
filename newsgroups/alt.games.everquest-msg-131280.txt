That is not necessary.  All that is needed is to see how Plaestine responds
when Isreal pulls out.  Bombings do not just continue, they _increase_.

No one ever said that.  They can be as mad as they want to be.  What they
can't do, however is continue the aggression.  That's what these peace deals
and cease-fires are about.  No one says "ok, we'll stop shooting, and you
guys just promise to cut it out when you've gotten it out of your system."
Yeah, Palestine's going to have to swallow their anger.  Isreal does that
every time they pull out and try to strike a cease-fire.  Palestine can show
some maturity for once.

I'll bet if Palestine would stop the violence, Isreal's tanks wouldn't show
back up.

The facts remain.  Tanks roll into Palestine, bombings drop off.  Tanks roll
out, bombings increase.  Say what you want about the reasons, it's obvious
what Isreal needs to do for their own protection.

No one's asking Plaestine not to be upset about the past.  None the less, we
don't all get to act on our aggressions and not suffer the consequences.
Palestine has sank their own hopes for peace.

Then Isreal needs to send Palestine packing.  Transjordan seems like a good
place to send them.
