I've noticed this "bug" for several months now.  I had asked the
enchanter (my EQ husband!) to cast VoG on my pet for fun loving, and
lo and behold, the pet did not poof after the battle.  The pet finally
poofed when VoG wore off.  

Sometimes the enchanter will  VoG my pet but I tend to get annoyed
since it is a pain to try to get the mob to swipe me.

I haven't bothered to test with other hastes.  I *think* pet poofs
with Wonderous Rapidity so figured there must be some special property
to VoG.
