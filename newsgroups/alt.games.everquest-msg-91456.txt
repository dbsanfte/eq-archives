Yes you can in Shar Vahl BUT some of the spells are missing. Namely the poisons and Divination spells. There is also a trainer and a
few spells in Shadow Haven in the Druid/Shaman/Beastlord/Ranger training area. You will need to do a little faction work with the
city to be able to train though. Cabilis is the only place I have found that has all the spells but spirit sight. That one is in
Oasis of Marr at the gypsy camp.
