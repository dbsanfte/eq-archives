I hope your not aiming this at me brother Squid. I have been fighting
for this and other countries for 15 years, I have been from Grenada ,
which most of these kids don't even remember or were even born, to
Panama, DS and part of the rescue detachment to Somalia to get my
brothers out.

All I have to say to this post Is AMEN Brother. 100%
