I have had the thought that I could get my surname removed.  Then try
setting my surname to Lovespotatoes or Potatolover at some time when
there's (almost) never a GM on.  But the only real purpose would be to
get some screenshots fighting a dragon with a fire-based breath weapon
(I have been told that if you have your lag turned up to max there's
flames shooting out of Ragefire's mouth as part of his animation).
But that could also be accomplished by touching up a screenshot to add
the offending name, which would have the benefit of not risking ending
up on some GM's personal shitlist as a wiseass.  Beyond that bit of
amusement (the screenshot) it would really be kinda mindlessly
derivative to take such a name anyway, that sort of thing only has a
creative feel to it when you're the first.  (It sure would be nice if
at least some of those kiddies wearing the 6 bazillion variants on
Frodo/Drizzt/Sephiroc/Taliesin/Legolas/etc could understand that.)

Alas, the moment has come and gone, Ilikepotatos is with us no more.
