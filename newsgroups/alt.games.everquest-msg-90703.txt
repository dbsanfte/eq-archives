LoL, try doing a  naked corpse run through the Dreadlands at level 50 to get
your body in Karnor's Castle. The mobs in DL will attack on site and are
dark to light blue at 50, and dangerous even at green, even with your full
armor. If you'd died in KC, in say, the well room, you will not be going to
get your corpse, unless you want to set a new record for how many times you
can die in twenty minutes.
Here is an example.
I was in the well room with a group. Pulled 2 mobs and started fighting. 3
more popped on top of us.
Only thing to do here is run for zone. Unfortunately I went Ld and died,
when I got back on I was at the soulbinder in FV. No corspe run for me. I
got one of the group to get my bod then found a 56 cleric to full rez me for
50plat.
Total loss= the 50 plat was about 2-3 hours worth of grinding. 1 hour of
playing time lost while I sat around arranging for corspe retrieval and rez.
A further half hour getting a new group, since the old one had replaced me.
Your correct on one point. When I was a level 9 warrior and died in
Blackbarrow, I just ran back, got my stuff, and carried on fighting. Only
used up about 20 minutes of playing time, and a bit more to get back the
lost exp. Wish it were that simple now.

As for travelling. Just wait till your in Rathe Mountains in a sweet group,
killing giants and making a fortune, only to find yourself overloaded with
cash and fine steel weps, with the nearest bank several zones away in the
nexus. Before sol it was even worse. See how you like running to Lake Rathe,
swimming and running to South Karana, running through SK to North Karana,
zoning into the nexus, zoning into the bazaar, selling all the weps for plat
offloading the heavy cash, then making the run back again to make more
money. You might wish you could port yourself, or at least get a port to cut
down on the downtime.
