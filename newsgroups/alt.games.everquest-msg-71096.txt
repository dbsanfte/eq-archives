  No, you pick one if you still want to use such an anecdote to help
prove your point.

  I was only clarifying the facts on that one case which you may or
may not have been aware of.  I made the disclaimer that my post was
off topic and I didn't really post it to refute any of the rest of
your message, which I more or less agree with, in fact.

 I am just inclined to think Americans don't irrationally sue as often
as some people and TV comedians seem to think.  The media is generally
sensationalist and will sooner give an incomplete story that sounds
incredibly [unbelievable, ridiculous, amazing, unfair, passionate,
ect.] than a complete story that somewhat diminishes the "incredible"
aspect of the story that they mention in their 30 second blurb,
sidebar or monologue commentary.

  Though maybe people do sue willy-nilly.  It's just that the
anecdotes I've heard of "ridiculous" lawsuits usually don't seem quite
so ridiculous (even if I disagree with the person suing) after
undergoing a little scrutiny.
