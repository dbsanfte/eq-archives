Lighten up a bit, Darktyger.

You can laugh at the stereotype without believing there's any truth to it.

Maybe we should make drummer jokes instead? Would be appropriate, given the
obsession some bards seem to have for finding the perfect drum...
unfortunately I don't think it would work, as bards are the only musicians
of note in Norrath.

"What do you call someone who hangs around with musicians?"
"A bard with specialisation in percussion." (assuming there is such a
thing).
