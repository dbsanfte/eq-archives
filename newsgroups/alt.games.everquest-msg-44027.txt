> What would you suggest instead?

It has always been easy to fix .

1) Put up a bind box similar to the res box and let everyone be bound in any
legal place .

2) nerf caster mobs down to a level appropriate mob. Level 25-45 caster mobs
are incredibly dangerous since they have both good spells and the full
combat capabilities of a pure tank class . If a lvl 35 magician mob had the
600 hps and hit in hand to hand for 24 max while still having the normal
magician line of spells it would be far better . This is the sole reason
najena, sol A , permafrost , droga , nurga , kurns , befallen , dalnir ,
kaesora , and city of mist see so little use . Of course then they would
have to actually balance above 50 spells . most spell lines currently look
like 1 3 6 10 15 (17) where the 17 represents what the after 50 spells get
upgraded to , and in some lines it is worse than that  (for instance
enchanters, and necros go backwards). If they raise this 17 to 21 they can
remove the absurd hand to hand abilities of caster mobs.

3) Dungeons that have exits that are not close to the entrance should be
fixed . Chardok and sebilis are bad for this . kaesora and droga are just
ridiculous.

4) put lots of level appropriate gear in them . The reason the ancient croc
is so heavil;y camped is not that the loot is so good, it is rather that
both the appropriate level same type of loot is missing for both lower
levels AND higher levels.
