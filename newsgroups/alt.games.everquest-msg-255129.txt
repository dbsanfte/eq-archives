Berzerker crits aren't AA archetype or AA POP, they are innate at level 
12.  Presumably a big enough difference to piss said person off (who 
wasn't, I should point out, a warrior nor did he say his main was a 
warrior...)

Further, we get crits off 2hs, throwing, and frenzy... dunno about 2hb 
and 2hp, but I'd guess those too.  I think rangers get archery crits and 
rogues get throwing crits... but isnt that it?  And what do warriors 
get, melee only, or do they crit on throws and archery too?

Its still all eye candy as far as I can see, the 2.7% boost in DPS seems 
a drop in a fairly empty bucket, if Berserk is supposed to be a DPS 
class at the high end of the game.

Grage, 40 berzerk a long way from the high end of the game, Luclin
