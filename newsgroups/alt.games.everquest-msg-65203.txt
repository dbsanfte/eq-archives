I'll have to check but this was full version.  You'll have to become a
member at $10 a month but you'll have the full original EQ. Then only $30
for Luclin.  Otherwise the classic is $10 at the stores. Of course if you're
not interested in the magazine it's irrelevant since you'll spend half that
on the magazine or more, but it came with several demos.
