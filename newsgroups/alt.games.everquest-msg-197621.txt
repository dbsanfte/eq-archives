The fastest PL technique in this case might be to have the druid cast
a damage shield on you and have both the druid and shaman buff you up
and heal you.  You then get some beasties to start hitting you.  The
damage shield harms the MOB every time it hits you, but the damage it
takes is not assigned to anyone.  This means that as long as you hit
the mob for any amount of damage, you will get the experience for
killing it.  With a high level druid, this is a very powerful
technique and can get low level people like yourself a ding every 20
minutes or so.  If you do try this, do not let the shaman slow the MOB
you are pulling.  You actually want to get hit as much as possible,
and just have your friends heal the damage.  More hits = more damage
to the MOB.

This method requires you to act primarily as a tank, not a wizard. 
Just as Stormguide wrote, your casting skills will lag behind as you
level up because you aren't casting spells very often.

A few things you can do to PL that won't realls screw up your skill
development:

Get an enchanter to cast some kind of Clarity on you.  The best spell
for you, and for most cases, is C3.  You see people casting it for
donations in the Nexus and Plane of Knowledge.  (C3 is preferable just
because it lasts so much longer than its higher- and lower-level
counterparts).  People tend to donate between 20 and 100 plat just for
having this spell cast on them, but most of those people casting it do
it for "donations" and will be willing to cast on you for free. 
Because you are only level 11, most will understand that you cannot
come up with the same kind of donation that a level 55 character
could.

Clarity will increase your mana regen rate, reducing your down
time...So you can get back to nuking things ASAP.

The druid and shaman can also aid you without making the creature die
faster.  The druid can snare anything you pull, allowing you to more
easily kite something.  (Kiting means running around with the MOB
following you but not hitting you).  Either of them can root your
pulls, although the druid will do some damage when he does this so you
may want the shaman on root duty.  Using these skills you can begin
working on your kiting skills with little danger.

The druid can also fear any animals that you pull.  This makes your
job easy, as the creature never touches you, and yet you can sit in
one place, standing to cast your nuke, and sitting to med.  The shaman
can also slow all of your pulls to make them less dangerous in case
something goes wrong.

Using some of these techniques, you will still be casting a lot of
spells and probably keeping your skills up just fine.
