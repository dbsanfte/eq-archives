Its not a necro-only thing, mages and enchanters can do it too.

Its a hell of a boost to a group, thats for sure.  It's also dangerous as
hell.   I've been exping in PoV just lately, and charming a golem with my
chanterbot, he makes an incredible difference to the kill-rate, and with
snare, is reasonably safe.   1 stun, 1 resist, somebody not paying
attention, charm break when the warrior is below a bub (with a cheal about
to land) though, and *somebody* is dieing.   Whether its just the MA or the
group, that risk is always there (of course charming is nodoubt a lot safer
when you aren't 4boxing)

Balanced.. I dunno, but it isn't as out of sync as you think
