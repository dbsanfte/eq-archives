In the off hand Stave of Shielding always outdamages a fist. In the main 
hand even Wu stick always outdamages a fist. There are arguments that 
Tranquil Staff (though two handed) outdamages even epic gloves. And it 
certainly produces less hate than two obscenely fast hands

There is something wrong with this calculation. Due to high speed of the 
baton, fists catch up to it around level 55. That is in the primary hand
