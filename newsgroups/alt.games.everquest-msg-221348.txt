YES .

A taunt that works should add an amount of hate on the warrior equal to 1
higher than any other character plus the amount a shaman slowspell, tash ,
or snare generates which ever is higher . A taunt skill should work like a
forage skill , once you get to 200 it should always work :p

The problem a warrior has is his taunt is useless. Once you fix that you fix
the unholy monk nerf with ac and make ac a strictly linear function then
everything is fixed.

The problem is and has been twofold . Warrior ac has no effect over a
certain low number , and they cant use it anyway since mobs generally just
ignore them.

The real reason it wont get done is that sony has a god damn boot up their
ass anout the whole ac situation that was explained to them in excruciating
detail before they went ahead with the unholy monk nerf. That was one of the
worst design decisions I have ever seen , and it is completely laughable
that they still sit up on their fine horse and say "but it was the right
thing to do we tested and everything"
