Actually, that was at a time when I wasn't even -interested- in the high-end
spells, as they were hopelessly outta reach anyway.. Heh.. :)  (Don't bother
asking how long it took me to get to level 52... WAAAAAY too long.. Heh..
:) )  But I disagree with the poster that said "Nothing less than CHeal"
will close the gap... If I wanted to play a cleric, I'd have picked the
"Cleric" option at the character creation setup...  But, by the same token,
we are often asked to fill in as a backup healer.. especially in cases where
the cleric is OOM, or has taken aggro by his CHeals...  from about 45-50,
our Greater Heal does not do the trick... AT ALL...  There is no way I can
chain cast Greater Heal enough to keep a tank who is getting wailed on
alive, long enough for the cleric to either get CHeal off, or med so they
can cast it...

Finally, at lev 51, we get our Superior Heal, where we, once again, can
adequately fill the role of backup healer...  Note, I say Backup...  In
areas where the tank is getting beat up on by lots of mobs, or powerful
mobs, there is absolutely no substitute for a cleric.  I wouldn't
even -think- of joining a group in Chardok where I was expected to be
the -only- healer.  And that's the way it should be.
