I agree with those who say that hell levels should stay in, however, I have
never once experienced the whole post hell death thing.

from my logs (which unfortunately have a gap from level 32 to halfway
through 35, and I had only started them in level 31)
I died 2 times in 35 (the part in my log)
I died 0 times in 36
I died 7 times in 40
I died 0 times in 41
I died 2 times in 45
I died 0 times in 46

I get all my stupid shit over with IN HELL. (like trying to solo stuff that
I really shouldn't, *cough* chancellor, won *cough* frenzy, gated *cough*)
then just plow my way through the level afterwards so I can get back to
being a dumbass again.
