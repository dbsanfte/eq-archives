Yes but it's a rather simple matter to not read threads you have no interest
in.  See *skunk* in the subject line?  Click on past.

Then again I may be an unusual reader as I only read about ten persent of the

Over time I am sure an EQ2  group will be created by some insane gamer.

Always with respect.
