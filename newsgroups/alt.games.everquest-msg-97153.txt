Doesn't keep me from wearing an Othmir hat, but then again, that
Othmir had already been killed by someone else and I might as well
honor its memory by letting what could be useful be useful. Same logic
applies to my gnome skin ensemble and my coldain skin boots.

Othmir aren't animals. They're nice people and I only kill people I
don't like or who don't like me.
