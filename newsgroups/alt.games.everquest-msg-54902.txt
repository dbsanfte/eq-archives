At what point (obviously post Kunark, but how much?) did the level
restriction go in. There's a persistent rumor (and the person making the
claim is still in the game and active, by the way) that a uberbuffed up
Bard solo'd Naggy. Level 60? Not sure. But obviously it would have to
have been in whatever window of time there was between the 51-60 levels
being added into the game, and the Naggy/Vox lair level restrictions.
