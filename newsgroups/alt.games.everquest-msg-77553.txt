Waste of exp IMO.  A necro is so good alone, he simply doesnt need anybody
else.  When I was leveling my monk to 60, my r/l friend was leveling his
necro to 60.  His gear was total trash (to be honest it still is.. he didn't
put any time at all into gear, raids, loot.. he just pure exp'd) and he did
great.   We either duo'd (as r/l friends) or he solo'd... and soloing he
never had a problem.  As he hit the high 50's, he didn't even get summoned
anymore by the 50+ mobs in SF... and alone, his downtime was minimal at
most.

> Necromancer/Ranger. -Pretty much same except as the Druid except it's more

Same as above
