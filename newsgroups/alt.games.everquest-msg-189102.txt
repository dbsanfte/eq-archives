ZI frogs in storms (nophtans) are always level 61 (they were always even to
me on track when i was there at 61, always), PoS *does* have a higher ZEM
than CoD (ref: patch message saying ZEM in PoS was increased)

Also, allakhazam doesn't mean jack shit compared to empirical knowledge.
I've attacked things that allakhazam's said summoned and not gotten
summoned, I've seen things 5 levels higher than allakhazam says they go.

I was in CoD at level 60 (many different time frames);  ALL foul/corrupted
puslings on my tracking from the zone in were EVEN con.  Maybe they could've
been 59 back when PoP was *very* first released, I don't know, I didn't get
into CoD until about a month later.
