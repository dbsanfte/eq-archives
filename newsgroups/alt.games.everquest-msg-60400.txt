For Halflings Hide is 30 and Sneak is 50 and will never go up
unless you are a rogue. These are racial abilities of the Halflings.

The best use for sneak I have found is to buy from NPC merchants
that con 'dubious' or 'apprehensive.' Go behind the merchant, target
them and keep hitting sneak until they con 'indifferent.' This allows
you to buy from 'dubious' merchants and gets you better prices from
'apprehensive' merchants.

Hide is great for resting and meditating in hostile areas unmolested
by wandering critters. To use target some mob that normally cons
different that 'indifferent' (ally, warmly, kindly, amiable, apprehensive,
dubious, threaten, ready to attack) then keep hitting the hide button
until they con 'indifferent.' You have to do this because only rogues
get messages when they have successfully hidden or sneaked.
