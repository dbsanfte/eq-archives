HAHAHAA

Clyde, member of the trailer park mafia.  I can tell by your E-mail address
you're still exhibiting penis envy toward Getsum and Razor.  Has the broken
hip ever fully healed, old man, or are you still a wannabe skier criple?  If
I have hopes of being as good at EQ as I am at FA, it's going to become very
interesting around here.

So, you're a regular in EQ now, are you?  Good.  Hope to see you around.

Sword
