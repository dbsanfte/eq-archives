It's just those skills that you can't get at level 1.  So if you go to the
trainer and see skills that have a level marked on them (higher than your
present level) then you know that when you achieve that level you will need
to put a point in.  Don't have a list, sorry.  I know dodge takes a point.
So does research and the specializes.
