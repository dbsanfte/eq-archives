Same as it's always been.

Yes, they go on the keyring, and your keyring is always "with you".
So you can no longer get locked out of a floor you've already
been to (presuming you were the one using the key, and not just
riding along in a group which had it).

Furthermore, the "highest" key you use is the only one it
bothers to keep on your keyring, and that gives you access
to all lower floors.  For example, if you use the key to floor
six, it gives you access to floors 2-5 as well.
