Rumors are Yantis works with certain scum of SOE.  SOE can practically
generate platinum with a keystroke.  They give the set amount of plat to
Yantis.  Yantis turns around and sells it..and a percentage of the proceeds
goes into SOE's pockets.  Rinse and repeat.

Good deal for both parties.  This way it keeps SOE out of the spotlight.

And yes these are rumors, but for those defending SOE and assume the above
scenario could not happen is kidding themselves.

SOE was so quick to get EQ accounts/items on Ebay banned but allows
playerauctions.com to run rampant for years. Common sense tells me there are
certain sellers who work with them and get a nice portion of the profits.  I
wish I could generate platinum with a single keystroke.
