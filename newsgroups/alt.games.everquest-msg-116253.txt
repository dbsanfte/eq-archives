hi guys im now really hooked on everquest and i bought the gold edition with
luclin and now i want to play everquest looking its finest so i decided to
upgrade some components in my comp

what i have is a duron 950 with 256 ddr a tnt m64 video card and a sound
blaster live card.

with this set up i play with only half the new races ( and i want to see the
game with all the new race skins i don't like the old blocky ones) and no
sound and medium textures and compressed textures and the in game menu i
have particle effects (you spell effects) to low  and 3d sky off.

all i want to know is that if i buy a gf 200mx (thats all i can afford so
dont suggest anything else) and and extra 256 megs of ram

i was wondering with those extras could i play with all races (the new
skins) and see all social interactions, and mip mapping and high textures
quality and high particle effects casue i like watching the spell effects.
would it go smoothly?

thanks in advance
Thach Nguyen

and one more thing is the messenger of the queen worh keeping or should i
use a black alloy bastard sword instead. im lv 15 now
