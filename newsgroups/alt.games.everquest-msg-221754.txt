No, just the two emblems.

As Graefaxe said, it means multi-quested.  If another Druid had the
Tunare Emblem and you got the Karana Emblem to drop he could turn
his piece in first and then you finish the turn-in.  Of course, if
somebody else had goofed up a turn-in and left the NPC expecting the
Tunare Emblem he'd finish the quest with his turn-in and get the
NODROP spell, in which case you'd have to go back out and get the
other drop.

One nice thing about it being a L44 spell is that level 2 focus
items work with it (Mana Preservation II, Improved Healing II, and
Spell Haste II).  As level 2 focus items are usually much cheaper
and easier to get than level 3 items this spell could easily be
your most efficient heal even after you get Superior Heal at L51,
at least until you've gotten a couple levels past 51 to cut the
fizzle rate.
