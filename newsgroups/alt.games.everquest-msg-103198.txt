The upside, if you're melee, is that Primal is much easier
to obtain now and can be gotten by a much less powerful
guild. In general, killing the Warders is a foolish move for
guilds that can do it because it allows a lot more guilds to
start doing NToV much sooner.

The downside, if you're not melee, is that there is no
longer anything of interest in this zone for you (other than
seeing it, if your guild can spare the key ahead of melees
that need Primal).

I think it's very cool to have one-time-only events in EQ,
such as waking the Sleeper. (In fact, I wish there were more
and at various difficulties.) But it's a real shame Verant
couldn't think of any interesting content (e.g. raid-level
mobs and varied loot) to replace the Warders in their
"premier zone" after this event has been triggered. It would
be nice if there were some incentives to have the non-melee
continue going to the zone, and to reward the Clerics that
must toil here thanklessly for the melees to get primal once
the Warders are gone. Hopefully this will eventually get
addressed...
