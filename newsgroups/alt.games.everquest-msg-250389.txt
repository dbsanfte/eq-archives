Size is my guess, or class. For instance, a Half elf can only wear
medium or regular gear, or all all general stuff. If it is small, a
half elf can't wear it while a Wood elf (elf) or high elf (hie?)  can.

No.

Its something on the item. When you look at the item it has to say:

ALL ALL

or it has to say

WAR/HEF

or some combination of those (ALL/HEF) ALL/WAR etc.)
for you to wear it.

You might be confused by seeing "ELF" or something else, Elf is wood
elf while I think "HIE" is high elf. "HFL" is halfling, if I remember
right.

So you are probably confusing elf types, or sizes.

For instance, you can't wear this:

Small Leather Tunic: Wt 2.60. +8 AC,   Classes: Wr Ro Mk B Sk P C D Sm
Ra . Races: Hie Elf Hfl Def Gnm Dwf Frg .

You can't wear this:

Large Leather Tunic: Wt 4.40. +8 AC,   Classes: Wr Ro Mk B Sk P C D Sm
Ra Bl . Races: Bar Trl Ogr Iks Vhs .

You can wear this:

Leather Tunic: Wt 3.50. +8 AC,   Classes: Ra Sm D C P Sk B Mk Ro Wr Bl
HUM BAR ERU ELF HIE DEF HEF

The key one for you is "HEF" (half elf.)
