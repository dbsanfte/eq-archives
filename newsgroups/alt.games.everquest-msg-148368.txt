> How many EQrs with PS2 will play both Everquest games?

I personally have seen the screenshots in PSM and it looks absolutely
beautiful truth be told. Also, the network adapter in PS EQ game is
going to support standard dial up. Hopefully more network adaptors
will be more abundant by the time the beta starts, as I don't wanna be
a liar if picked. <g>

So my vote is for both
