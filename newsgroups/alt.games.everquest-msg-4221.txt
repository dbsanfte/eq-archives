Pages have a possibly to drop in any zone designed for the level of the
researched spell up to about that level + 5.  In other words, if you're
looking for Page 26L, (AE Mez, level 16 spell) you'd most likely find it in
a zone designed for 16-21s.

Honestly, most of my pages have been located by checking out MANY MANY NPC
vendors throughout Norrath.  Most of mine have been found in either Freeport
or Firiona Vie, but I think that's simply because those are the only places
I was looking.  If I were based around Halas or Qeynos, I have little doubt
that the pages could be found there as well.

Kinda tough right after a server patch, though, since I think they always
wipe out the extra stuff NPCs buy from players.
