There are a few other reptiles that do that, although I don't know how
many.  Fascinating concept.   I'm iffy on the details of
parthenogenesis, though- how does the species ever exchange genetic
material?   Or, to put it another way, how can California Whiptails
evolve as a species if the individuals never exchange genetic
material?

Thanks for the link, great info.  Will have to read it in detail when
I'm more awake.

Yeah, but the parents usually feel compeled to minimze the differences
by dressing them alike!

Oh sure, take all the fun out of it!   I know about the "ex-gay"
movement, of course... and the "ex-ex-gays"  LOL.   But you have to
admit its still a fun proposition to throw in the face of the
homophobes who use the "choice" argument to justify themselves...
usually results in a lot of indigmnant sputtering.

Oh sure, gimme more stuff to read, like my backlog wasn't big enough
already!

Say, while on the subject, I've always wondered why people try so hard
to isolate the gender we are attracted to from any other part of
sexual orientation.  I have met plenty of bisexuals who say that like
to do X with women, and Y with men, for example.   Then there's kink,
and sex/romance vs. sex/physical activity.  You get the picture.  As
tempting as it is to draw a line from "I like guys" to "I like gals"
as a linear model of sexual orientation, I have to wonder how valid it
really is to separate that axis from a more complete n-dimensional
model of sexual orientation.

Yikes, can you tell I was reading tech manuals all day?  Ignore me,
I'll be much more normal after I get some sleep.
