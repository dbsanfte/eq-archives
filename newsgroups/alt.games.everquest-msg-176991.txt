A few might be undead at night, i can't recall, but they're behind
doors and slow to agro so you could probably get out thru the jail
if you knew the route (I'd expect to make it that far if it were me).
But then you've got the run through the graveyard and out the canyon
(or whatever you want to call it) which will make for quite a train.
Unless he has SoW (or Camo/Invis) a L35 will probably be killed
trying that, a Paladin with a high MR might be able to make the zone
without SoW, but I sure wouldn't bet on it.
