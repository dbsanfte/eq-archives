The only concern I would have with the FV route is if you were KOS
to FV guards, I don't know if the wandering guards there can see invis
or not.  Otherwise, yeah, the drach's aren't that hard to dodge.  You
might have to stop and wait a bit, depending, there are two spots where
drach's will path right up close to the zone edge, and if one of the
see invis ones does that and you're of a level to xp in LOIO, well then
discretion is the better part of valor.
