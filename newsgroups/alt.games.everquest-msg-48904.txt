Hello everyone, recently I realized that I have a bunch of items on my
characters that I don't need and could be sold, unfortunately I don't know the
selling price on any of the items. (I've been away for quite some time) So
instead of spamming the zone with tons of price check requests (and pissing
tons of people off in the process I'm sure), I thought I'd ask here.  If by
chance you know the average going price on any of the listed items (truthful
and fair prices please), it would be greatly appreciated if you could post
those prices. (I know some of these items may be next to worthless, I'm just
not sure which ones)  Thanks a whole bunch.

By the way, if you are on the Tarew Marr server and would like to buy any of
these items, e-mail me and we can figure something out.  Thanks again!
