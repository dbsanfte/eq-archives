All my characters can root (ranger, wizard, cleric, shaman), so it not that.
Dont really miss sow on my wizard or cleric as I have a shaman :)

I guess for me its the other way around, wish I had a permanent method of
gating with my ranger, sure I can use thurg / gate potions but that is
annoying.  Of course if I get that PoP gate amulet I will have to rethink
this :)
