You can Identify Items by 'right clicking' and holding the botton with the
cursor. all stat's and limitations about the item will be shown for your
perusal.

As to How do you heal yourself and advice on getting exp and levels.

Right clicking on a Mob will give you a message. The color and text of the
message will tell you ALOT.
Colors are as follows (Easiest) Green, blue, white, yellow, red (Hardest)
The color will tell you right off hand how it compares to you. Green means
it's to easy for you. (no exp for green) If it's red Stay away from it
unless your in a good group. (Most exp but will smash you bad)

And since I've never played a paladin, I'm gonna post some web pages you
should check out
http://eq.castersrealm.com/menu/paladin.asp
Everquest Casters Realm has a good line up of Guides and advice. This is
link for paladin. everything from character creation to levelin advice,
skill info, spell info, etc. I suggest you read 'Paladin Strategies and
Guides' and thumb through the player submited guides for good info for you.
http://eq.stratics.com/content/articles/article_index.shtml
try begginers Guide to Everquest, combat basics, and group guides. they
should help you get started.

Hopes these help as I don't really know paladins that well.
Good Luck and the Gods watch over you
