Well, I tried it last night, it made a huge difference for me.  My zone
times in Kunark went down to 5 to 15 seconds.  I did not see any low FPS
issues after making the change, while fighting in Kaesora.  I will continue
testing further, but so far, it is great.  My zone times in Kunark before
that were generally 15 to 60 or more seconds.  After the change, I was
always the first person in my group to finish zoning.  I had time to wait
until I finished zoning, run upstairs, grab a coke from the garage, run back
down, and still have to wait on the others.  Only one of them typically took
a lot longer than me prior to that.
