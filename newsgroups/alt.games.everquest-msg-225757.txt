Oppps, there is a first time for everything.....

I have been playing for 2+ years and not onc have I had to send a /report
about someone abusing me.

Well I descided to solo with my bard for 1 hour before bed in OT. I was near
the ramp (SF zone) and so was a shammy, I mostly charm killed and was very
very careful to make sure none of the mobs I charmed were damaged or had
agro on the shammy. After one such charming (where I saw the shmmy runnin
toward the zone), the shammy tries to hit my charmed mob. After telling him
it was charmed, he proceeded with the extreem foul language.

I descided I must have been mistaken - he may have just dotted but it was
doubtful as the mob was WALKing away from were he had just run to - so I
mezzed the mob for him and moved out of agro range so he could have the
kill.

He must have killed it as I did not get and residual agro later. So 10 min
goes by and he starts with the potty mouth in /ooc....I sent  a /report and
petitioned (I did not say a word to him - to the point he may have thought
he was in ignore). Later being very pissed about this little incident I was
low life and pretended to run to the zone with a mob, when I got near him I
mezzed it and made for the PoK book.....needless to say he was not happy.

Well it was a first in getting my anger out in a semi-illegal way, I am just
so sick of wankers like this in the game who start with the swearing before
finding out the story.
