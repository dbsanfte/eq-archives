I dunno about that - but if you see a 56 mage around get
a muzzle of mardu from him - 11-15percent haste (depending
who you ask :-P) for your kitty.

New mage summons at high levels have +HP on them, and I've
always given my pet a full suit of Focus+armor if I was going
to solo for a while.

8 focus at +20 hp ea, 2 swords at +50 hp ea and Girdle
of MagiKot - +500hp.  Total 760 extra hp for your pet.
It's be elementary to verify that it helped, just summon
a low level pet, give these to it, duel someone and have
them land a 300pointish nuke.  A level 9 warder would
die if the pet didn't use the HP onthe gear.
