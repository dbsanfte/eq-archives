  It has happened twice over the last 4 months, but since the
last patch (now that I think of it) there has been a dramatic rise
in incidents, over the last 3 days I've had it happen 6 or 7 
times.  Half the time I just relocate horizontally, the other
half vertically, two of the vertical relocations resulted in a 
10000-point damage fall, one other only in a 436-point fall
which was not fatal.
