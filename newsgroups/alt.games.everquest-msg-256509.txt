I must admit I hade to grin at this. Every chanter gets angry when
mezzes are broken. :) But he was addressing the wrong person here. If
your group doesn't have the bard calling assist on his target then in
fact it is the MT's job to pick one. As the bard wasn't there for CC he
could have been main assist but this is something that should have been
made clear from the start. Usually it's a good idea to talk with you
puller *and* your group who calls assist. :)
But you are absolutely right about the enchanters duty. Unless you
switch targets mid fight he should not complain but mezz everything that
doesn't get attacked by you. If that means one mezz was for nothing so
be it. That has happened and will happen to every enchanter. ;)
He should have talked to the bard to assist you and nothing else.
One very popular mistake for everybody else than the MT is to always
assist the puller. When I was playing my bard I made it clear that
everyone assists the MT even and especially when I was pulling.

So, I don't see anything wrong on your part. Maybe some discussion in
the group would have helped. ;)
