Hi All

I want to get a pal the Titanium pack, but Sony's site is as clear as
mud about the fine details.  I assume if I pay on my Visa, and put HIM
down as the Shipping Address (inc. his email address), he'll get some
sort of Download Key or something in his email?

I'd appreciate it if anyone could say how this goes in the world of
Sony  :))
