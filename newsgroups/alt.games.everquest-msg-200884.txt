Thats simply incorrect. CH takes 10 seconds to fire off, and uses up 400
mana.  Superior healing takes 250 mana and 4.5 seconds to cast, and only
heals 583 hp. If you have a tank that has anywhere over 2500hp ( and a 40
tank can easily have that much with mediocre gear and level 39 cleric
buffs ) then any time that you can heal them for 1/2 or more ( EASILY
accomplished with an even mediocrely times CH ) then you will save mana (
100  mana to be exact ) over casting 2 Superior heals on the tank.  On my 40
cleric I always have up Superior heal, Complete Heal, Greater heal, and
Celestial health. Greater is nice for a nice quick heal to a caster who has
caught aggro.  Celestial I use for when SA types ( Ranger, and Rogue for my
group ) catch aggro. Superior is used to top anyone who needs it off after
the fight, and of course CH is used to keep the main tank alive during
battle.

So yes, CH can be used very efficiently even at level 39.
