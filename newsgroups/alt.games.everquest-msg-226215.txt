    What sort of fucktard would think it's the MalX spell that causes the
aggro?

    Actually, for the 2+ years I've raided with a high-end raiding guild,
it's been (assuming you were in the debuff channel):

Shaman tells the raid, "Malo is on %t."
Shaman tells the raid, "Attempting to SLOW >> %t <<"
Someone tells the raid, "Shaman down."

    Our shamans don't seem to be the worst in the world - they've got us as
far as we are. Our warriors do bitch about aggro, but not once have I heard
one complain about being outdone by a Mal-line spell. Maybe your warriors
don't own bows? Or like to go AFK during pulls?

    As I said above: what sort of fucktard would think it's the MalX spell
that causes the aggro? Pay the least bit of attention and you can see the
real culprit. Or are you trying to say something along the lines of "9 out
of 10 morons agree, shaman Mal-line is more aggro than magician Mal-line"?
And if so, why do you think any of us care what morons think?

    Pot, meet kettle.
