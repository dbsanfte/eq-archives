Having a 65 Pally in my guild who I've done more than a few LDoN gig with
I can say that in at least 2 LDoN dungeons (Guk, MM) Pallys own.  Course
she's got Slay3 and a pretty hefty 2h.  I can say as a 65 War I wasn't
being either the MT or even secondary dps source in those dungeons. heh
kinda depressing actually.

On your first point above Kaev, root pulls are quite a valid tactic and
if you have a chanter or other mez type pulling in 3 or so to camp
isn't a BadThing for LDoN.
