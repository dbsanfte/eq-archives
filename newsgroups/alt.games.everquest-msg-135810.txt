No point in this if you are selling stuff collected by a warrior, cleric,
necro, wizzie, shaman, and monk, and selling via a bard mule.

But the loc part, yeah, I do that.

You *do* know that you can select an item off the search list, and right
click on the name to be pointed at the seller, right? Makes that much
easier. And um, to search, you type /bazaar.
