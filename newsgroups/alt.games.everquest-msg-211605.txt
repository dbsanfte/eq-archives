/shrug
Depends on the level of the gear.  Untwinked or lightly twinked the
plate class has access to much better armor.  If your heavily twinked
enough it doesn't matter.  My ancient twink Ranger (has existed for
almost 4 years, just dinged 21 tonight) is wearing gear that is all
wearable by a knight or Warrior except for Tolan's arms.  And contrary
to your assertion elsewhere in this thread, I am quite certain that a
knight or Warrior wearing that gear would only be a "better" tank only
in the sense that he'd have a few more HP (not that many more at such
a low level).  If I were untwinked I would be noticeably inferior to
a plate tank, middlin' plate gear is just too cheap/easy to get.

If you're gonna tank you need AC first.  Get some HP with your AC,
but that's pretty easy to do (HP and STA gear on my Ranger twink
increases his max HP by over 50%, but every piece was chosen for AC
first, HP/STA second).  Now that's not necessarily a refutation of
your "focus on HP" assertion, I'm not at all certain that building
a Ranger as a tank is intelligent.  OTOH, I may well never play this
character past 40, and he can tank that far in the gear he has.
