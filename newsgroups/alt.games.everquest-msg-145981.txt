A there will always be newbs.  If they vanish, the game slowly dies.

B verant stopped giving us the information that would let us distinquish
between a crowded patch server, a crowded login server, and a
"servers locked" situation.

Since there are people who post here with EQ windows or multiple
machines, its possible that a query here will get a response that
EQ actually IS up, in which the advice to try again in a few
minutes is valid, while if it ISN"T up then chain attempting
login for the next 15 minutes is an utter waste of time.

Considering that many boss mobs pop on reboot, getting
in right away when servers are patched can mean getting
a shot at some really nice drops, so just writing off
a couple extra hours after the announced end of a patch
isn't necessarily the most clever choice.

If a multicomp AGE poster gets in here and tells us when
he gets on, then AGE readers all gain an advantage over
the rest of the unwashed hordes.  Is it any wonder people
come in here starting threads hoping one of those people
will give a positive response?
