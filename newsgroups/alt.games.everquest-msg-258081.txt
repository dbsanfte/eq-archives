I dunno about you, but for me, that time before assist is called isn't 
spent idle.  I'm figuring out which mobs in the pile are beating on who or 
what, and may need to be taunted (not attacked) to get them off a 
cleric or chanter, and figuring out which one the tank is actually going 
to call assist on is a key part of that.  

Sure, in the ideal, boring, one-mob-per-pull world we live in these days, 
it hardly matters if you do -anything- before assist is called.  But I 
hate that world.  Practice for the overpull, pray it comes. :)
