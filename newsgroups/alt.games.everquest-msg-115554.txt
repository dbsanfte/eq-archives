At 53, I still solo a fair amount.  I don't melee much however, I do have a
weapon, but it's usually packed away while I hold a higher wisdom/mana
scroll in my primary hand.  For quite some time now, soloing has generally
involved not getting hit, but rather sitting on my butt medding,
canidancing, and watching the blue mob die.
