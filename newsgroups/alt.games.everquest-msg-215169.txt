Nope, popularly believed, but not true, not unless the change is pretty recent.

A couple years ago, as my cleric, I lost my level in a partial wipe (killing VS
as I recall), putting me down about two blue but barely over the line into the
previous level.  A paladin managed to survive the mess somehow, but no "real
rezzers".  So he gave me a 0% rez, getting me back to my body.  I then rezed the
rest of the dead and then rerezed myself.  Not only did I not ding, I didn't get
any exp back at all. All it did was cost me a bunch of HP and all my mana.  A
bit later, we killed one mob and I dinged my level back, thats how little I was
back into the previous level.  Any rez at all, other than that 0% one, would
have done it, but at the time we believed that you could get a real rez stacked
on a 0%, and on no other rez.

Now luckily these days paladins have perfectly adequate 90% rez, plus I'm deep
enough into 65 that dry looting wouldn't be a problem if thats what it came down
to in order to get a group moving again fast.

But at the time, it sure was annoying, since I "knew" that I'd be getting that
96% rez from myself and just needed the ride back to my body first.
