They fell into a very difficult to avoid trap.  The original team
set out to make EQ a challenge, and to a significant degree they
succeeded.  An awful lot of the bitching from players was whining
about things being "too hard", or whining about things being broken
when in fact they really were "working as intended".  The dev team
fell into the habit of assuming that the players didn't know what
they were talking about unless proven otherwise.  Personally, I
don't think that's half as bad as their subsequent policy of
catering to the every whim of the powergaming guilds, or their more
recent policy of pandering to anybody who squeals loudly enough for
more than a week or so.
