Shammy. Much more efficient heals. Buffs.

Bards are terrific (my main is one), but they are not a good two box choice
IMHO unless they are going to be the main thing you are doing and the 2nd
box is more the "support" toon (or if you really just want them for one
song, but that seems silly to me).
