  True and I've said so in previous posts, but the threat of war definitely
made it worse.

  Most of europe.

  How were they "turning against you"?  They weren't doing everything
the american government or people wanted them to do but then again neither
were you doing everything they wanted.  The fact is that they stayed in
NATO to keep the american alliance strong, despite the fact that that
alliance ceased to be useful with the death of communism.  I mean who is
NATO defending against?

  So they are protectionist so what?  So is your buddy Bush.

  Actually they are, this is international diplomacy the standard
of buddies is low.

  No I mean those that would correctly see the next Gulf War as america
dictating the political makeup of arab states.

  By diverting resources and diplomatic capacity to this stupid Iraqi
adventure.  The fact that there has been some success (significant ones
I'll admit) does not make diverting his attention any more acceptable.
Al-Quaeda is not dead.  American agencies responsible for security are
not reformed in any significant way.  America is still in danger,
principally because the work that needed to be done was not and will not
be done.  Appointing a head of "homeland security" that doesn't believe
9/11 was an intelligence failure is not a good sign.

  What a proud boast.  He's also killed less people that Ted Bundy (I think)
what's your point?

  So he's a lying snake.  So what?  He is still not a threat to america.

  Yes.  Because for him to be able to do damage he would have to have enough
arms that he is unafraid of america, which will never happen.

  He is not on my property he is thousands of miles from it.  In any case
contray to government propaganda Hussien is not rabid.  He is very rational
and perfectly willing to refrain from biting dogs bigger than him.

  If the rapist knows that my entire family is armed then he's unlikely 
to bother me.  In any case Hussein is not in our neighbourhood and the
states in that neighbourhood are not asking for us to gun him down.

  What makes you think that I'm not looking around me?  Just because I don't
accept that everything the Bush administration says is true doesn't make
me ignorant, quite the opposite.

  How does Iraq poses a "direct threat"?  He has a pathetic conventional
military and little or no nuclear capacity with no delivery system capable
of reaching our allies except Turkey.

  Not true he kept an eye on him, just not a hand.

  The first does not neccesary imply the second.  There is no reason why
anything has to be "fixed" beyond telling Saddam "use the weapons and die".
