The MOTD said that the trolls relocated to Neriak, and if you were 
camped in Grobb or Innothule, that might also mean YOU. So take it that 
the trolls camped in those 2 zones would wake up in Neriak.

See answer to (1)

Would think that they reset trolls DE faction. Cant be sure of course, 
but since they made sure to use new faction for the new Gukta froggies, 
they have been thinging about the problem. But can anyone go to confirm 
if former KOS trolls are KOS or not?

If theyre stuck, they got a problem. SERIOUSLY hope they fix the Neriak 
Doors. Never been there myself with my troll, but know the famous troll 
trapping fletching shop of Thurgadin, where you CANT even camp out due 
to being ducked.

Would guess they moved those quests too. This dont look like something 
they just did, been planned a long time to do it like this.

Well, i dont see a rule anywhere that you HAVE to stay in the area near 
your birth town. My troll headed to Nro at level 10, andt thats about 
same run as from Neriak.

I couldnt disagree with you more. This is a totally cool idea, and 
although my troll warrior been mourning the loss of his home, and his 
love Zimbittle, this is still a cool major change in the EQ world, and i 
DO hope they make more like that, i would rather like a changing dynamic 
world that just new zones from expansion XXXX.
