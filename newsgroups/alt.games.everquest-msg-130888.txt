I'm not sure, but I think there's a switch in the options to turn it off.
Personally, I leave it on so I know what groups my ISP has recently picked
up.  This was more important when I used Widomaker, since they didn't carry
some of the groups I wanted, so I left it on so I'd know when they finally
did carry them.
