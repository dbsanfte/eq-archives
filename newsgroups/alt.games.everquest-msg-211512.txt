    The author couldn't solo him, but with a few friends could put him down.
"Terribly tough" would be something that requires more than one patchwork
group to handle, or one airtight group. Mini-nameds in Plane of Fire are
like that, I find. We have to have one well-made group (in terms of class
composition) to take one down, or more than six people of non-optimal class
selection. I'd be interested to see if a group around the level of the spell
(52) would be able to complete the quest and handle that mob, though.
