True.  And I can tell when someone is AFK.  Can't you?

Not on every mob without me knowing.  The odds of the same
person having every mob they loot empty is exceedingly small.

That's "(t's only a crime if you catch someone" logic and
invalid.  Every player contributing deserves equal rewards,
especially in pick-up groups.  I wouldn't go to Cappy in
KC with NBG logic in place in a pick-up group, either.
Nothing drops there for clerics and I'm not "nice enough"
to subsidize other person's upgrades.  "Roll on everything"
that's droppable, split all loot after the cleric gets
peridot costs back.  They're not there to fund me and I'm
not there to fund them.  That 6K jade mace might not be
something I'd use, but I can sure buy an upgrade with 6k...

Guild groups, of course.  I much prefer to "/gu anyone up for
some XP" than "/ooc 56 cleric LFG."  And all the people with
alts that I know from their mains.  Doesn't everyone have a monk
or rogue twink? :)
