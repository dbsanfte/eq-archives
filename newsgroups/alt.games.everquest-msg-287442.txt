fair points - but everyone i would invite would already own a copy of
the software though - all ex eq players who are fed up of the things
that nearly everyone still reading this group can't help but nod their
heads to when someone's complaining about "developments"

if i get it set up and running right, i'll probably write a short
script to edit quests and then it'll be a breeze to make your own
custom eq - and i'll probably share that if there's interest
