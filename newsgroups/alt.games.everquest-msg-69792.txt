I have been waiting I don't know how many months to start a Beastlord.
Now I run into the problem I don't have enough memory to function very
well on Luclin.  I want to create a beastlord and then take it to the
Qeynos or Freeprot area.  I was wondering if my character would be KOS
in these areas?  If so does anyone know of a city I can goto with a
decent newbie area where the guards won't eat me for a snack?
