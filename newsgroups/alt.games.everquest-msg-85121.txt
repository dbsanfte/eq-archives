Why? The lowest  population blue servers are still not anywhere near
full. So why do you feel you need a new one besides getting a fresh
start? If its ALWAYS just to get a fresh start on a new server, you
then have the problem that people always want a new server. In 2 - 3
months that new server you wanted so much is already an old server
with the same problems that the newest currently low population blue
servers have. At that point someone will once again post, either here
or on the official EQ boards, "when are we getting a new non split
server?"

If I owned verant I'd not make a new one just because people want a
fresh start. They'd be dumping several thousand dollars on new server
worlds constantly when current server worlds are underused. That is
like setting money on fire. It is not good business at all and it only
makes a difference in the VERY short term.

All you have to do is ignore others  for 2 - 3 months and make your
fresh start on any one of the newer blue underpopulated servers. After
the 2 - 3 months you can start not ignoring others and the server will
be exactly like the new one you wanted would be! Yay!

The only logical Ideas I've seen to solve this "fresh start" need that
some people seem to continually have, would be to have ONE server
which is wiped every 2 - 3 months.  At that point you could choose to
have your 2 - 3 month old characters moved to any of the newer
underpopulated blue servers, or not and they'd just get deleted. After
said wipe the server would start over like a brand new server again,
then again people would be moved and the server wiped in 2 -3  months.
I think that would work quite well in satisfying the need that some
people have for a fresh start while also opening their eyes to the
fact that people are always going to power level up to 50 within 3
months and then the server will be a lot like every other server.

That would essentially solve THREE problems:

1) the people with the need for a constant fresh start fix would get
that (some people might even continually play on this server though
they'd get deleted every 3 months.. never bothering to transfer that
char to another perhaps)

2) some people just buying the game would enjoy the fun newb start and
then be transferred to woefully underpopulated blue servers at an
adequate level to handle them while having had the newb server as a
good intro to EQ. In time this is good for the people on those
underpopulated blue servers.

3) due to the knowledge that the new newb repopulate server is wiped
every 3 months, tons of people would not move over just to get 50 as
rapidly as possible to be uber on that server. This would mean that
for the first time on a fresh start server the population would be
pretty untainted by EXTREME power leveling. That would make it an
excellent place to get an introduction to the game or to just make a
new char in a fresh enviornment you'd later have transferred to a blue
server.

I think that would be a far better idea than just continually
expecting verant to make a fresh blue server just everytime we feel
there has not been one for a long time or because a new add on came
out. That just becomes such a huge waste when the population on the
new server drops like a stone and in 6 months you just have yet
another woefully underpopulated blue server world which cost them
thousands of dollars. 

Another option, but one which would piss the current players off,
would be verant moving people from underpopulated blue servers on to
each others servers then taking one of the underpopulated blue server
worlds from that and making a new newb blue server.
