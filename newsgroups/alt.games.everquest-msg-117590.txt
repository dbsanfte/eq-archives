Sorry, I don't mix my real name with my character name...I get enough
harassment here and in game, I don't need to give folks added ammunition. ;)

I've seen Dagger's Path around, but don't really know anything about you.  I
got the impression you're average 30s so we don't really travel in the same
circles yet (we're average 45ish).  Either that or you're a fairly new guild
I just haven't dealt with yet.

BTW, avoid Followers of Nobility...their name tells the full truth...they're
snooty and self-important with little reason to be.
