I got it from a lvl 12 ^^'ed sand covered crab on that beach near
archer's woods. They're gray to me now, so I've moved onto farming
scorps, snakes, and cubes in the Vermin's Snye, which seem to drop
slightly better than the crabs did.

It's actually safer to solo there, since there's that named mob on the
beach that had a bad habit of wandering up behind me while I was
beating on a crab.
