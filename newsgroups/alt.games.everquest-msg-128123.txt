Ok ... Maybe someone can help me or at least explain what is going on.
Why is it that in some zones my familiar graphic will be with me while
in other zones it will not.  In the zones that it is not with me am I
still getting the mana regen that I should (seems to me like I am not)
but that coule just be me ... =)  I have e-mail tech support about
this several times and have yet to get a reply ... is there anyway to
fix this?
