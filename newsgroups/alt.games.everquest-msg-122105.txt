Are you SURE Jazz?

I've been FD'ing recently and critters will continue to beat on me if I've
been in combat with them sometimes, even though I dont get the "has fallen
to the ground" message.

Its never happened with one thats randomly aggroed me and while I hadnt
made the DOT connection it sounds pretty workable for the situations
I've seen.

Maybe a new bug with the recent spell changes happening?
