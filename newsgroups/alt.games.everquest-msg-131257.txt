I'm not following you here.  Remember, this isn't me, the cleric,
making this plan.  Rather its them, the dead "can't  rez myself"
people who are cunningly thinking "hmm, there's a raid tomorrow
morning, I'll log out and then check back then to see if good
old Bergh is on..."

A) They can easily find out when the next raid is if they don't
already know.

B) If there isn't one coming up soon they'd better think of
another plan

C) In neither case am I even the slightest bit responsible for
the failure of their cunning plan, although perhaps if there
was a turnip involved....
