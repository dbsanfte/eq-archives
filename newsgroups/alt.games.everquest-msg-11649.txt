Bleah.  Typical min/maxing bullshit.  As long as your'e strong enough
to carry your armor, your'e fine.  Sure, more stamina is a good and
wonderful thing, but it's not like it's going to break the game for
you.  Nobody's going to deny you groups because of your stats.

Besides, low to mid 80's isn't a bad start at all, really.  By the
time it'd matter, you'll either have enough stamina gear to make up
for it, or be in groups where your stamina can be buffed up.

In short, it's no big deal.
