All the above is true, BUT...  I have a Radeon LE, and love it for all my 
games with 32-bit color.  Undying and Alice look particularly sweet.  But 
EQ isn't a 32-bit game (yet).  While Warslik's Woods is smooth enough that 
I actually can keep my 100% clipping and not scream, there are problems 
with the Radeon's dithering of 16-bit transparent textures.  So you either 
get "black rain" shimmering of the sky, or grainy artifacts on spell 
effects.  Which do not kill the game, but make it a little less perfect.  
This isn't just me; it's well-documented on the rage3d.com discussion 
boards

I also get little flickering bleed-throughs from time to time, but I 
suspect that this may be a bad setting that I can't track down.

So while I do very much like my Radeon LE (particularly for the price), it 
isn't ideally suited for EQ...but it may well become so, once Luclin's 32-
bit graphics engine arrives, or if ATI ever fixes this dithering problem.
