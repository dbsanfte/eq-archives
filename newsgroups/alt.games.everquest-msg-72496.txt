inventory, its like got all my stuff but like in a black table, not the nice
old blue squares lay out. Up side is u can see thru table so nothing sneaks
up, but i hate look of it. If u right click an object text overlaps onto ur
money bar so text is messed up as backgrounds are like smokey colour almost
transparent. can u revert to old, pre velious display?

At least I don't see the tags, but its still annoying as hell, but what
really annoys me is the "u" usage, why the fuck can't people spell out YOU,
it's a whole lot more readable that way, same thing with "ur".

I'm willing to pass on the un-capped "i" usage because its not that bad, and
I've given up on trying to change people off of "plz", but "plzplzplz" still
pisses me off insanely.  (yes, I'm aware he didn't say "plz")

Oh, and also, as another general gripe, people need to learn how to use a
hard return when they type out a long message in email or usenet.
