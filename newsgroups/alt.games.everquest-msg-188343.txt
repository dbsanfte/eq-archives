    lol well, having had my tank out tanked by numerous monks, you can bet
your agile ass I was pretty jack of it and quite PLEASED when they were put
in their place. I don't care if they'r tank number 4 or 15, they shouldn't
be number 2, not unless you want to give SK's and pallys their dmg output.

    Well, I do sympathise, being nerfed mustard been hard, BUT when I
remember all those uppity iksar monks soloing the LR in high keep when I had
2 levels on them and would've needed a serious group for that room...... I
think about them being nerfed and I feel very little pity.

    More or less, yeah. SK's are on the up also it seems although perhaps
not so much as the pallies.

    NOT That I think we need de-nerfing. The last thing I want is to be in a
class that people think is "Easy" ;)
