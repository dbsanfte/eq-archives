Nope, don't worry about it.  If you're meleeing for any other reason than
'cause you're FM and bored, you're doing something wrong...you're not a
tank.

At the moment just keep upgrading to whatever weapon has the most WIS/Mana,
though I'd avoid 2hb weapons...I can't think of a 2hb weapon that has more
mana (WIS+mana) than a charred guardian shield (or paw or ToV) + an average
WIS weapon.

Always keep an eye out for stuff that increases resists though, particularly
fire, cold and magic.  When you go on your first dragon raid mana ain't
gonna make much difference, but that fire or ice totem in your off-hand
will.
