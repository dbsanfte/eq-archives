Well, I got my wife her own account and got my mother-in-law hooked at
the same time.  They decided to create a monk and a shaman, so I figured
an enchanter would be the perfect third for that group.  Well, my wife
has gotten her shammy up to six and my mother-in-law got her monk up to
5.  I've been busy, so I've only been able to get my enchanter up to
four.  But I was wondering where would be a good place for this trio to
go fight.
