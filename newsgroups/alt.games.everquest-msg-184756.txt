Yea but the thing is that if it were a server side problem then everyone
would see it, and I'm not seeing it.  I would guess it more likely to be a
graphics/sound issue.  There is a lot more dynamic graphics going on in the
bazaar.  Even though most of the vendors are just standing there the engine
has to treat them all as movable/animatable objects.  I suspect that some
part of the graphics engine is messing up and suggest you to go get the
latest drivers asap.
