  No... it just ended up taking alot longer for my house to close than
I thought it would.  Things were a bit crazy for a bit.... but are
normalizing now.  We've already found a house we (I) like (love love
love!) and it does have high speed internet access.  And our realtor
lady says that with the sizable down payment we are making, we might
close escrow in as little as 3 weeks.

   The last 3 weeks have kinda sucked, but life is getting alot better
quick!
