    That is a damn nice mantle.

    That would be good for me for two reasons:
        - my current mantle, although havign seriously cool resists, adds
zero hp and stamina
        - it would preclude me from thinking about the 8th shawl

    I'll have to talk my guild into doing him at some stage :o)

    Cool, I regularly group with a mage...... he's a complete nutcase,
bought a mana robe for 70k and has it sitting next to newbie armour pieces.
He's been talking about getting some sort of elemental charm thingy for BoT,
sounds like what you're talking about ;)
