That's true enough. At least the Vox Ale was made to be reasonably doable.

And getting the gems out of sebilis is a lot easier than having to make
planar raids for them as when the quest first came out.

When SoL comes out, it will actually becomes easier for bards, warriors,
and paladins to complete their epics, because they will be able to hang out
at 52 and continue doing vox/naggy raids without having to purposefully
take unrezzed deaths to avoid dinging to 53...just switch your xp over to
the "non-level-based-advancement" earning table, and continue killing away
between raids.

Course, that only partly helps warriors...severilous is a gimp, but
actually finding him alive is the tricky part on most servers.
