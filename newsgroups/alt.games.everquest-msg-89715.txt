Let me get this straight...  Is it really your contention that
the (alleged) current lack of decent guides is because of an
essay, barely remembered by most people these days (and not
even seen by a majority of players back then), written
A YEAR AND A HALF ago?

Could you run that one past us again?

believe supports such a characterization.  This ought to
be... interesting.


> err, I respectfully withdraw the question <G>.
