Just to be different.  Erud's Crossing has plenty of spawns and is
pretty profitable up to level 15.  The zombies by the sunked ship on
the other side of the island from the dock are the most consistent
spawn, and they'll take you to 15.  The wisps the island used to be
famous for wander about all over.  If you know about the greater light
stone quest, you can make about 100-200pp in an hour here.  Plus, a
big deal for me, you'll probably be the only person in the zone the
entire time you're there.

Also, the Warrens, but I've found that the pathing and the closeness
of the spawns make the zone a bit trainy.  Still, it's nice change of
pace and can be profitable both experience wise and cash wise. 
Raising Paineel faction there may or may not be a plus, I haven't
looked into it closely, but at least it may provide you with another
spot to train as a shadowknight.

Paludal's experience is insane, but you won't get rich there, and your
skills most likely will lag, and you'll also be sharing a zone with a
vast majority of the newbie 'tards on your server.  That also means
there's a chance you'll be fighting for spawns.
