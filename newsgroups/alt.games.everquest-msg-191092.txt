Yes, because we know that this feature killed Quake, Quake 2, Unreal
Tournament, Counterstrike, Battlefield 1942 and all the other
multiplayer FPS games. Noone ever plays those, right?

A first person view is definitely more immersive. I'd be a lot more
nervous and excited about PvP if someone could be sneaking up from out
of my field of view than if I could see everything going on around
me. I don't see how this could be considered a "game killer", and it
seems to me there are millions who agree.
