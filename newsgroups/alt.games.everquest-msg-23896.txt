As a mage I have to get my focus items. Now that I'm approaching lvl 39 and
getting a lvl 34+ fire pet I would like to finish that focus item quest. I
have the torch, the fire drake scale and the gem, but now I need Fire Giant
Toes. Does someone know where the heck fire giants are stationed which drop
the toes?

The only ones I could find in Allakhazam's bestiary are the Fire Gaint
warrior and wizard in SolB and they are way too high a level to get my hands
on. I mean by the time I can kick their butts I'm at a level that it doesn't
matter because the focus items don't work on lvl 50+ pets...
