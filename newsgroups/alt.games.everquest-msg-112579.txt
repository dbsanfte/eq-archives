That would not help your mana regeneration at all.
All that extra wisdom does is give you a larger mana pool, it will
not increase your current mana at all. You still need to med up
to your current pool maximum.

Generally, the rate at which you regen mana depends on your mediation skill,
any clarity spell (Breeze, Clarity, Claity2, KEI), any 'Flowing Thought'
items you might have, and any bard mana songs.
