Use of profanity is not unknown in any social strata.  OTOH, the
continuous spouting of vulgarities in ordinary speech is, in my
experience, mostly confined to boys between the ages of 10 and 30
who are either unemployed or in the military.  And when I say
continuous I mean that these boys (they are never men, whatever
their ages) can scarcely draw breath without saying "fuck" half a
dozen or more times (I am not exagerrating).

Better educated assholes are often more effective at being assholes.

I agree with you wholeheartedly about the always ugly idea of a 'better
class' of people, but consider this as well...
While people who "put on airs" are generally being rude, people who try
to behave in a more kindly and restrained fashion than those around them
are generally only accused of "putting on airs" by assholes.
