I was reading the group this weekend and posting normally, when I got
a message that I have submitted too many posts in a certain period of
time and to try again later. The message also said that this was being
done to prevent mass postings from commercial entities.

Now come on. My typical rants and responses surely take a *lot* longer
to post than someone doing mass marketing. What gives? Anyone else
ever gotten this message?
