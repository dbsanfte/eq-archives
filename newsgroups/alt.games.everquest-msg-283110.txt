However worn haste does stack.  You got any?  There's a 36% haste aug
from DoN merchant you may be able to get if you don't have any worn
haste item.  Other factors can influence the dps including the other
worn item/effects, attack (both worn and spells), stats, aa's, etc.
Take for example my main (70 beast, 538 AA) with basic self buff plus
pet gets about 200 dps.  With other buffs (chanty, shammy, etc) the
dps hits 250 easy.  But with discs, short duritation raid buffs and
more, I've broken 600 for a few minutes.
