There's a cave/tunnel thing on the east wall of the zone, slightly
further north than the cat city; you can locate the tunnel entrance
from a fairly long distance away, because a torch is inexplicably
stuck in the wall there, casting a beam of light on the stone wall.
This tunnel is (apparently) the entrance to a yet-to-be developed
zone, and nothing paths into it; it's safe to med inside the tunnel,
and you can (generally) pull things there without anything else
joining in or wandering by. For those of us *without* tracking,
invisibility, SoW and/or snares, it seems to be one of the few places
worth setting up camp, at least in my experience.
