I read something on this newsgroup a while back saying that weapon
procs aren't based on the number of attacks with the weapon but just
based on a proc rate for the weapon (listed in the "procratemod" field
for the weapon on Lucy which in most cases is zero).

How does this apply to weapons used in the offhand?  If you attack
with the offhand less due to dual wield roll failures does this modify
the number of times the weapon procs or not?
