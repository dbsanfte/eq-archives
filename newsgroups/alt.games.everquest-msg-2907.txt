I have a couple questions about my Monk just turned 25 love the class. First
off this is my second melee class, is there a ability or skill that has the
same effect as Taunt?
Next do Monks ever get to score a critical hit?
Last since Verant nerfed the Monks with the trade skill containers, is there
anything besides the Bag of the Tinkers, or summoned bags, that are very
light under a pound (example like a Cured Silk bag Monk only)?
Thanks
