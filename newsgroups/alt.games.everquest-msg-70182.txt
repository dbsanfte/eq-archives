Hello-
Here is my Problem.
Please keep in mind i am a non technical person  :)

Before SoL - I woould occasionally lock up after playing for a while like
most...
about 3-4 times I would log on my main and loose my macros.

This weekend I reinstalled EQ kunark/ veliuos also to E: drive where SoL was
installed.

1. Went ld zoning a few times...went ld after 2-3 hours of play another
time.  When I did get back on I had lost Macros again.
Tried to put in a backup of main (made it fewdays ago) but when i logged on
still no macros.

2. Another time I logged in I had the same wierd game play I had a few days
ago.....wierd game play = everything felt normal but game chat was on a
delay. Also I would go up to fight a mob and just sit there...attacking but
no actually swinging and spell cast would fizzle (unusual) and then when it
would get off it and about 40 seconds of sword play would all go at one
time....?  all 40-60 seconds after I had either swung sword and/or cast a
spell...
group mates did not seem to notice this so I felt it was just my screen on
the wierd delay....No one complaned said I looked normal and funtioned
normal to them.....?  -boy I hope that made sense.

3. Almost everytime when I log out of game I loc up and need to restart
computer....   I rarely if ever just go LD and dont have to reboot.

4. When downloading Patch i get this message
     ** download size exceeded for distrubution
                "  *New texture for Main*
                " *New texture for Kunark*
                "  *New texture for Velios*
I dont have a clue what that really means but doesnt seem right
I have all xpansions and options marked for download and have done the
"Thorough" more than once

I scandisk all drives daily and it does on auto when I have to reboot after
LD.
I defrag all drives daily also.
Before I start to play I run a program to kill all programs that are working
in background and run at 94% system resources free
I update Norton Virus every time before I attempt email check.
Ran virus scan and says i am clean.

-All other alts play fine and have yet to loose there macros.
-I am on drinal
