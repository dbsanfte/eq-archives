Posted this in the quests newsgroup, but it doesn't seem as if there is much
traffic there:


EQ folk:
I am looking for quest for my necro.  I would like to know what quests will
allow me to get the upgrade to the purple robe I got as a newbie, but I have
had no luck so far.  I would also like news of quests that lead to INT
items.  I have done Lucia's dress now and would like to find a quest that
gives me an INT boost in a slot besides earrings.

Thanks!

Boneyard, 10 necro
