1) They won't ban his account for a drug name... they'll rename him.

2) Seeing as they'll just rename and not ban him I have no issues with
them being very strict in the enforcing the policy... even if it turns
out the name you innocently chose tuns out to be the hindi word for
asshole or god, or whatever,  its really not that great an imposition
to have to change it.
