Hiyas

Seeming the topic of names seems to be causing alot of fun here in this NG,
I thought I would mention some thing that just happened to me. It went some
something like this:

Rodneyking: hi can I have some buffs?

me: *no response*

Rodneyking: please I need some buffs.

me: /petition is the name "Rodneyking" acceptable? if not there is a player
here called this.

Rodneyking: you there?

me: yes

Rodneyking: please buff me

me: sorry I dont assist poeple with names like yours

Rodneyking: lol wtf?

me: no response

Rodneyking: please buff me.

me: no

Rodneyking: lol loser.

Guide: No, that name is not acceptable and I have escalated it to a Senior
Guide, thanks for letting us know.

me to guide: Thanks and safe travels.

me: *smirks at Rodneyking*


That was the first time I have ever used /petition and I honestly think it
was justified. Just FYI "rodneyking" was a DE necro.


Ben
