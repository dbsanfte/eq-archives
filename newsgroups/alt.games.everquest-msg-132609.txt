Druid root can last up to 3 minutes, which it does on a fairly
frequent basis for me.

Monks do a SHITLOAD of damage, no argument, but to do that damage they
have to be getting beat on.  They have to find mobs with fairly low
dps to kill.  Druids can kill damned near any blue mob they can come
across.  If they got some nifty, and fairly cheap equipment, like say
ES Vambraces, they can kill evens if they have any patience what so
ever.

Travel, and the whole total class independence thing.  Kinda like
necros, just worse.

>> Or a druids buffing ability.

Never had any of my guildies ever turn their noses up at my crappy
PoN.  Close enough to cleric AC/HP buff, and it has that handy regen
thing.

Granted, we're not an Uber Raiding Guild(tm), but we do pretty damned
good.

But all wizards do is nuke.  No DoTs.  No heals.  No buffs.  They port
better than druids, but druids are better travelers all around.

Druids.  Moonfire 1150.  6.2 cast, 2.5 recast.  One cast every 8.7
seconds.

According to Casters Realm, enchanters don't get any normal nukes
after 54 (Dementia), except for an Ancient spell (Ancient: Chaotic
Visions).  Just for shits and giggles, lets use the ancient spell.
775 damage.  6 second cast, 8 second recast.  One cast every 14
seconds.  FYI, the 54 nuke Dementia does 675 damage, 6 second cast, 8
second recast).

Hmmm.  Clerics get Judgement at 56.  925 damage with a 4 second cast
time (nice) and a 9.5 second recast time.  One cast every 14.5
seconds.  

Mages might actually have druids beat on nuking here.  Lets see.  At
60 they have Shock of Fiery Blades.  1005 damage 6.8 cast and an
INSTANT recast.  So, one cast every 6.8 seconds.

So, over two minutes (120 seconds) a druid will be able to nuke 13
times for a grand total of 14950 points of damage.  Enchanters should
be able to nuke 8 times in two minutes for a whopping 6200 points of
damage.  Clerics get 8 bombs too for 7400 damage.  Mages do however
come out on top with 17 nukes in two minutes for 17085 total damage.

Ok, druids are third best nuker, behind mages.  Who can't port, heal,
or really buff.  Summoned focus items are nice, but with the new
equipment focus items, they are hardly overpowering.

>> Or, to bring things full circle, druids very respectable healing
>> abilities.

>400 mana 7000 heal from the cleric

Clerics are the only REAL healers in the game.  It's their one, sole,
defining purpose.  They damned well should have the best heal.
Because they can't travel for shit, and solo about as well as a
warrior. 

>400 mana 2400 heal from 2 torpors from the shaman

With solo and snare.  Really handy for in the middle of those fights.
And that is a heal over 24 seconds.  And sucks 50 mana too, but at 60
that isn't a make or break thing.

Don't get me wrong, VERY nice spell, but it's also from my
understanding damned near unattainable.  Or at least very, very, VERY
rare.

>400 mana 880 heal from the druids

Could be better, I'll concede, but it WILL keep a tank alive very
nicely.  And if the changes on test go live, that will be 978 heal for
400 mana.  They drop the mana on this to 300, MAYBE 250, and druids
will make excellent back up healers, as opposed to just pretty good
back up healers now.

Necro's are solo gods (and good for them).  They piss and druids solo
ability from a great, great height.  No argument there.  The bring
somewhat less to a group though, although not as little as many think.

Shaman are good soloers, no argument, but they lack one very crucial
spell to make them as good a soloer as druids:  snare.  Snare makes
adds simpler to deal with, and makes recasting spells a breeze.
Granted, they have pets, but pet still has to take damage to do damage
and if it all goes pear shaped, the mob will be on the shaman like
white on rice.  Shaman are a groups best friend though.

Enchanters can solo, but have the same problems that shaman do, just
with much less offense.  And they don't even have SoW if problems
arise.  

And lets not discount druids ability to GET to these hunting grounds
quickly and safely.  HUGE bonus.

Now, if you wanted to pull out an example of a class that solos like a
druid, with as wide a range of hunting grounds, you should have gone
with a Wizards.  Can get to places almost as well as a druid, have
snare, and can make mobs into small piles of ash very easily.
Granted, they're rough to play for the first, oh FORTY levels or so.
As opposed to druids which are pretty much cake to play for all 60.
