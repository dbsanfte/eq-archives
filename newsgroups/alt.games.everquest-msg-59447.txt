Dungeons get tougher with just a duo as you move up on levels. (Trust
me. I was half of a warrior/cleric duo for longer than you want to think
about.) But down near thirty it's still quite doable. Of course, you're
not the same caliber of healer as a cleric to be doing the old "toe to
toe shuffle" with the warrior, but who knows? Your extra buffs, DS, etc.
might more than make up for it. I never tried that combo.

Anyway, yes, you listed most of the good ones. Personally I think you're
a bit early on for ToFS yet. Mid thirties is better unless you've a full
group, and even then, I'd stick to the first two floors. I'm thinking
Dalnir or CC is definitely your play, and your odds of getting more
group members is significantly higher in CC. The fact you died there
because of a cerebrally challenged bard is no reason to give up on it.
