While waiting for tech support to reply in regards to restoring my old chars
I've created a ranger on another server since I've always wanted to play
one. Now I have a few questions on how to lower my agro so i don't act as
the mana sponge in my groups (obviously not high enough to play with jolt
yet).

The methods I've been using is turn off attack and back up a step if the
warrior/sk can't taunt of me and re-engage once they have re-established
agro. At times this doesn't work (when they tank is lower in level than I am
etc and I regain agro soon as i fight again) I equip different weapons,
usually 2 1hb's since that is my weakest melee skill or I equip a 2 hander
which usually is enough to keep me from getting the agro off our tank.

Only problem is when I am pumping out reduced damage with my weaker weapons
I feel i am not contributing as much as i could, yet i don't want to create
more downtime by endlessly gaining the agro and draining our cleric. I have
a weapon i can use once I hit 35 which will proc a minor rune buff which
should help a bit but until then I need some serious advice on how to reduce
my agro and still contribute a good deal to the group. Any tips?

(before the reply comes and I know there will be at least one person who
says "play a monk" i've been there, done that and sucked at fd splitting so
it's not an option =p)
