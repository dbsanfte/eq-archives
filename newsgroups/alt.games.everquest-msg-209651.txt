For what it's worth kaev...I don't think you did make it clear. :/  I
didn't read the earlier conversation between you and DB, just this thread,
and my eyes got bigger and bigger thinking "whoa, Kaev is going off the
deep end...what RPer pissed in his cereal this morning?".

Course, now that I know you and DB had "hidden issues" your response to
his post makes more sense, but for a little while you had me going
thinking I better not talk to you again cuz you think people like me are
the hypocritical scum of the earth.
