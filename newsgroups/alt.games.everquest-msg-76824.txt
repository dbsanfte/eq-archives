stuck screens?

are you talking about random pauses in the game -almost like it locked up,
but then continues like normal?

i get that with the new textures enabled. with them off i never get a pause.

my setup was:
win98se
celeron 500
768 megs ram

but because of the game (i feel it has one of the worst 3D engines ever),
and some extra christmas money, i got a Celeron 1GHz.

i switch around OSes all the time. i use Win2k Pro, WinXP Pro, Win98SE, and
WinME. and i go back and forth between NTFS and FAT32, depending on my
mood... i have a 6.4 and a 5.1 gig HD... all my drives are ATA33, 5400 rpm.

in WinXP, i think NTFS is slightly slower than FAT32. that could be because
i usually have a lot of stuff compressed (not the Windows or EQ directory
though).

converting from NTFS to FAT32 usually leaves the clusters at 512 byte, which
slows things down a lot in Win9x when you're doing a lot of small file
transfers... increasing the cluster size increases performance a lot. i may
try someday to use NTFS w/ 1 or 2k clusters.
