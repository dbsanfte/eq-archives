I'm smoking good ole Texas homegrown.But seriously , SOE is not out to
screw EQ2 players.Most of the good ideas built into the game come from
player feedback.The few in-game problems I have encountered have been
quickly responded to by GM's.You don't create an empire the size of
Sony without a good track record of customer service.Instead of
thanking them for the ability to next boxes ,people complain about
flooding the market with boxes.BIG F***ing DEAL! It's a game for crying
out loud and should be challenging.If you can't handle the challenges
then maybe you should play Pac-Man or Pong.
 Just because they don't change the game to benefit YOUR character
doesn't mean they don't listen.
