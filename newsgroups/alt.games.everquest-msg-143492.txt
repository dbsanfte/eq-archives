I've always found the reverse to be true.  Easy to find a single target,
hard to find a quadder paradise.  I happily soloed half of each level
from 44 to 54 in Cobalt Scar, for example, and no matter how
many quadders there were, I never had to do more than run a little
further or wait another 30 seconds for a wyvern (or drake) to pop.
A quad kiter needs 4 mobs to kill or his method is less efficient
than single target killing... with a single target guys like me grabbing
mobs as they pop, the quadders have yet another nuisance on top
of the other quadders to consider.  I'd happily let them claim any
camp.. but ignored claims to this or that half the zone, as did anyone
else.

Quad kiters also need similar mobs, ones that all have the same
run speed and little features like forget range and aggro range
that can really screw up a kite.  A single mob soloer can take
any mob he likes, changing tactics as needed, without having to
worry about whether he can find three more like it.
