 Most of FV any way. If you just go straight to the bank you should be
ok. If you start wandering around you could die. The shaman on the docks
are not on FV faction. There is at least one other mob I know of, out on
the nw wall, that isn't on FV. I think she's PoG or something. Used in
the Druid Epic quest but she's not on normal druid faction. Ranger,
possibly, not sure.
