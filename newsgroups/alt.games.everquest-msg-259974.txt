Exactly right, at which point you need to make a choice:

1. Play the first few weeks anyway, knowing fully well it'll be
   crowded.  It's the price you'll pay to get to play it upon
   release.  Another price you'll pay is people ridiculing you if you
   complain on usenet about the crowds during the first few weeks.

2. Don't play upon release.  Wait a while, maybe even more than two
   weeks, until the crowds die down.

I take it you'll choose #1 then?  Expect to be ridiculed if you
complain.

Only since about 1980 (yes, I typed that right), except back then,
"massive" was 20-50 people, not 200 or 2000.  :)  (Considering EQ is
broken into zones, the overall experience is NOT that different.)

Honestly, do you think any of this is new?  I've seen people bitching
for over TWO DECADES about player killers, camp stealers, kill
stealers, etc.  Complaining about WoW's crowds is damned assinine
right now.  Jumping to wild conclusions about their "you ping it first
and it's yours" approach may be intellectually stimulating but
everyone's theories are little better than wild ass guesses.  I don't
mind guessing, it's just important to RECOGNIZE them as such.  As it
stands, some people seem to be practically writing off WoW as hopeless
because of it.  They're acting like fools.

All that ever seems to change is the people who think they know it
all.

I've played on Battle.net - I know what a weenie most of the people
are.  I also know it's a FREE SERVICE and that if Battle.net started
charging $13/month, a lot of those people wouldn't subscribe.  It's
just damned stupid to think WoW will mysteriously only attract
Battle.net weenies.

Reality.

Sorry, but I disagree.  Comparing a free service like Battle.net to a
pay service like we'll see in WoW is just fucking dumb.
