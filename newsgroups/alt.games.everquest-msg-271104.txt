There is no neutral trader.  If there was, he could sell neutral badges, 
and half the disparity between factioned and neutral would vanish.

The clan and omni traders both seem to pay better than Antonio.  I 
haven't found any similar disparity in vendors on the mainland, but I 
keep forgetting to bring out one of the Leet collars, so I can see if 
that means that All vendors on the mainland pay what Antonio would, or 
what the faction vendors would.  Or some third price!

One of the skills, by the way, says that it affects bartering price, but 
I haven't seen any change in what a merchant will pay, with the skill at 
10 versus 50.  Might be a myth.

The scouts and specialists are killable, but the exp is terrible, and 
they drop loot very rarely; I'm told that you get bonuses for killing 
aliens if you have the AI expansion, though, so that for someone not 
running a free account it can be worth staying and leveling up on them 
for a while.
