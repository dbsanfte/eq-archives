It's worse than that, because arguably the L29 familiar is not worth
it.  All it does is give you +10 on all resists, which mostly only
matters for raids, and you won't be on that many raids before 49, when
you get the next familiar, because before 49, the level difference
between you and the raid mobs is too high for spells to land (except
perhaps the level 44 Enticement of Flame spell, since it is a lure).
