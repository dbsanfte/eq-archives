You haven't been buying all of your spells?  tsk, tsk, never know when one
of those might be useful...

At 14 you get Summon Food/Drink, just keep casting it over and over, don't
even bother dropping the stuff or putting it in your inventory, just leave
it on the cursor and keep summoning.

That said, at 45 my conjuration has been running neck and neck with defense,
both around 175 now.  Divination passed them up ages ago, rofl, I cast Camo
WAY too often.
