As I try to increase my dark elf cleric's  factions, currently with
surefall glade (which seems to be unheard of, as far as evil
faction increasing), I search for web pages of people who
have done so previously and can't find any.
My guess is this is because surefall glade only recently became
a port location.

Even through searching for general dark elf or other evil faction
raising I came up empty. Then I just searched for plain evil character
or class pages, once again empty. There seems to be no such websites
or even ezboards dealing with such issues. I find plenty of druid web
pages such as EQ druids or the druid's grove dealing with druid
faction issues but nothing for evil classes or races.

I guess I should make one or something; the problem is that I'm
moderately lazy ;)

The only site I know of that is only faction is a dwarf paladin's site
about raising his faction in cazic thule (actually part of another
site/ezboard) Other class sites, such as cleric, have info about
factions for the epic but that is all (Since for clerics there is both
an evil and good epic path, there is no info about raising lots of
good factions for the most part)

Anyone know of any such good sites which I've missed? Mainly they have
to be one that is current enough that they talk about raising surefall
and such. I don't need general qeynos area information per se since 
in trying to raise druids and such she is now max allied to good
guards, good clerics and the paladin guild (while getting max kos to
the bloodsabres ;)   ) She is even apprehensive to the bad qeynos
guards from so many jenam and rebbys in the freeport area.
