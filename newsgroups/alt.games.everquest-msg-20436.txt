We do know something about them. We know they named themself like an idiot.

Reminds me of this blurb I saw on MTV once, where some girl was whining
about how "people judge me based on what I wear...judge me for
me!"...ignoring the fact that WHAT SHE WEARS IS A REFLECTION OF WHO SHE IS.
Nobody forces her to color her hair purple and spike it while shaving "kill
all cops" into the back of it. Nobody forces you to take a retarded name
either.

> Why would he/she become an "Idiot" based on a name choice?

Lack of ability to have creative thought is a primo sign of stupidity, in
any circumstance.

> Are you they guy who is actually in charge of name association ?

Don't I wish.

> Who the hell gives you the right to judge anything ?

That would be whoever wrote the naming policy. For lack of knowing better,
I'll say: Brad McQuaid.

> It could be some teen that thought the name was funny. 

I've met plenty of teens who wouldn't think its funny. What is your point?
