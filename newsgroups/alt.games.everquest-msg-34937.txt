It really depends on what you see your cleric as being able to do. A lot of
people will go for good dwarf/dragon faction, as it allows you to travel a
bit more freely. Not to mention the fact that quest armor blanks for the
Kael quests come from Temple of Veeshan .. A lot of us won't see that zone,
so I suggest against it. (Unless you're in a guild that can raid ToV.) Right
now, my Dragon faction is a bit hosed, (never killed many giants, killed a
few coldain, hunted in SS a while) so I'm trying to get in on as many Kael
raids as possible to up my faction.

A monk in my guild went with Kael faction. Since level 30 he killed dwarves
(started in CC, moved on to Icewell and other spots) .. Recently he's
changed his mind, and is now going to ally with the dwarves. It took him a
lot of time to get non-KOS with the giants, and now he has to reverse the
damage he's done. A bit of a waste if you ask me. ;)
