Okie... I'm gonna make some assumptions here...
You talk about Human Qeynos armour... so I hope your Enchanter is Human,
else this is gonna be a waste of time :o)

Royal Temper is made with Brewing skill (trivial level is 135) and requires
2 'Essence of Sunlight' (dropped by SGs in Ro/Oasis rarely... and various
mobs in Skyfire), Griffenne Blood (uncommon drop from Griffins/Grifons and
Griffennes, Karanas is a good place to look) and Rainwater (can be
foraged... also dropped by some Gnolls in Karanas)

The precious metal bars (which are regular silver, electrum, gold and
platinum bars used in jewelry) are NOT enchanted if you're making 'Full
Plate', but ARE enchanted if you want to make 'Enchanted Full Plate'.
