Showing your true colours, I see. Dennis showed more class when he was
emotional about something.

You were the one who completely ignored the context *and* the intention (he
wanted to call someone a coward or a wimp, not put down women) and instead
focused on the possible origin of the word "pussy", somehow implying he was
a sexist pig. I did exactly the same. The origin of the word "lame" is
clear (far more so than the origin of "pussy"). Reread my message, and
perhaps with these additional footnotes you'll actually be able to catch
the sarcasm.

(Of course it's pointless to fight here, because as players we're on the
"same side".)
