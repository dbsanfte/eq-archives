Yeah, I stopped by and picked up a cheap little Piercer to get my skill
moving. Talk about LAG city ... Those traders are a cool idea, but I never
did figure out where to get a Trader's Satchel, required to sell. Anyone
know where I can buy one of those? I asked /ooc twice but no one answered
...

Yeah, in the time that I was there I saw several fights break out over who
was camping and who had abandoned their camp, and so on. Reminded me of
Highpass, as you say.

Yeah, the place is a tough place to fight for exactly the reasons you
mention. I'm told that there's a fort somewhere that's got good hunting,
I'll go back and look for it if I get bored in Paludal. Right now I'm
soloing sensate mushrooms (blue) just to get back in the rhythm.

Even I remember that. I had a max skill Enchanter at one time and spent
forever killing Aviaks trying to find Black Pearls. The place was regularly
packed, it was pretty fun.

Aren't you just a *tiny* bit curious how Planes of Power is ... ?  Do you
have any chars on E'ci?
