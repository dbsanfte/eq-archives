Well, about two weeks ago, I think, somewhere around then anyway, I happened
upon his pet's corpse, unlooted, looted 114 Silver off it.  So, make that
1+pp in coin.  I was stoked, bought the rest of my level 1 druid spells at
level 3, and had money left over.  Was playing a half elf druid (Is there a
worse choice for that?).  I also remember how happy I was to loot a belt
pouch, and a rusty Scimitar.  Haven't played there again for a while now.
