Oh but it does tell you with absolute certainty.

When it says "you could probably win this fight, but it's not certain" 
it is absolutely certain that you won't win. :)

The messages themsevles need a newbie overhaul. "A group of people your 
level could probably win this fight, but it's not certain"... or "A raid 
of 4-6 groups your level could probably win this fight, but it's not 
certain" would certainly be a lot more informative to newer players.

Old timers are used to pretty much ignoring the con messages, and have 
learned through long experience what is actually doable... that doesn't 
mean the system isn't in need of an overhaul though. Not everyone knows 
that cons are group based, or that even high greens can tear apart an 
unprepared mage class...
