Took a minute for this to make sense.  Am I correct in inferring
that prior to the AA refund patch you had Run3 and Regen3 in
General along with sufficient points in Archetype to meet the
basic prereq for Class AAs, so that you were able to put your
refunded points (and any you've gained since then) into more
Class AAs even though you no longer had enough General to do
Archetype?  If so, this is an amusing little bonus for those
who had substantial AA investments and found Regen less useful
than their Class AAs.
