From the shadows, the mysterious Foxeye Vaeltaja

You say their dps went down by so much, but how much did YOUR dps
suffer? Your usual weapon is superior by a huge degree.

All the time the mob would have been dead had you been using your main
weapon it still would have been hitting you with the shadowflame.

It's unlikely the healers are actually saving mana at all; it's just
being spread over a longer period of time - which also means you're
killing slower, moving slower, and getting less experience.

I would hesitate to advise anyone to follow this lead.
