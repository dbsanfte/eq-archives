Do the second quest with a mule, I did it with a lvl 1 human rogue. Do it
until you have 5 or 6 stacks of whiskers, then bring in your sk to the DE
room (you should not be kos there, my iksar necro was dubious to start).
Transfer over the whiskers, then just before you hit 'Trade' in your window
to the DE, have someone invis you -- she won't accept the whiskers until you
are apprehensive to her, and invising will make you indifferent. Once you
hit apprehensive you don't have to be invised.

I think it took me about 160 whiskers to get dubious to WFP/EFP guards, and
this has the added benefit of making you ally with all the shopkeepers in
freeport.

To get into NFP, kill lots of orcs in EC & WC (orcs in Ro or the Oasis won't
work).
