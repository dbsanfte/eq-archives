Hold off a few levels. If you have PoP, then when you hit level 7 or
so, pop over to Butcherblock. Run toward the docks, then follow the
coast to the left. You'll see a couple Aqua Goblin camps, then a few
little dwarf huts. Keep following the shore and it'll curve eventually
to a single-spawn aqua goblin camp. Good xp and the backbones, vials
of blood, heads, and steins all sell for 2-3pp each (vials and backs
are stackable to boot!). Made 150pp between levels 7-9 working here...
