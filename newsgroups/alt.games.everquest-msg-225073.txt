Lets see, on a 96% rezzed death in level 65, I lose a smidgen (sp?) of a 
blue, there are 25 blues in the level.  Even assuming that most of them 
started out only one yellow into level 65, after the rezzes, they likely 
kept their level anyway.  Heck, I would be surprised if they lost more 
than a couple of blues or so after the rezzes.
