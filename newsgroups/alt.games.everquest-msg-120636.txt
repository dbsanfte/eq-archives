You're new, so I'll be nice to you.  Get used to patch days.  They don't
happen all that often these days (usually the month before and a few weeks
after an expansion are tough though) but when they do, you can expect down
time to be 6-8 hours, at which point they bring up the servers...only to
bring them down a couple hours later, for a couple hours,  to patch the
patch...to fix stuff they should have found on the Test server.

EQs been going strong since 3/99 and almost every patch day is the same, so
there's very little point in bitching about it too much here...we've Been
There, Done That.
