Its the principle of it Ghorus. Selling an in-development incomplete 
product is just tacky.

If the government wanted to try out a new drug on you would you be 
expected to pay for the treatment? To pay to be their guinea pig so to 
speak?

Yet with SoE that's where we're at... we're paying to be their guinea 
pigs. I don't blame them for charging us... I blame us for buying it.
