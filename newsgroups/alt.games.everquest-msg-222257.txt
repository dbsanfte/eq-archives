No, the stats on the stone come from the number of successes *you* have.
It is not a value intrinsic in the stone.

Use solvent to disolve the stone, ask for a new one and it has the same
stat bonuses the old one used to.

Think of how charms work. There is a charm out there that gets better the
less people are in zone - charms (and the adventure stone) dynamically get
their value from an outside variable not an internal one.
