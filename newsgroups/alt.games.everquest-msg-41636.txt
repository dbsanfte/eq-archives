What I was glad to see is that some people here actually do understand that
what happened is against anything that Islam stands for.  Many people have
twisted many different religions to justify horrific acts.  Take a visit to
soc.culture.palestine, or soc.culture.afghanistan, it appalls me to see many
of the posts there, on both sides, those that celebrate the terrorism, and
those that advocate extermination of all Muslims.
