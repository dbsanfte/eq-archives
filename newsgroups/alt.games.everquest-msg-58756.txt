Main Assist.

This is a group term or even more likely a raid (multiple groups in a
fight) term.

The idea is that generally you want everyone to focus on a single
mob, take it down quickly, then move on to the next.  Splitting
up your effort means that you have all the mobs beating on
you for a protracted period of time while each is slowly
whiltled down.  If you have an enchanter, mobs that aren't being
hit won't be doing much damage at all, and even  if you
haven't, the math still works better if you eliminate mobs as
you go, instead of all at once at the end.

To do this, pick someone as the MA, and everyone else targets
him and then hits /assist to find his target.

A SA is often the "vice president" tank, there just like everyone
else unless the MA happens to die, in which case they become
the MA.  If crowd control is a problem, SA is also in charge
of intercepting and dealing with adds in some situations, and may
even have a small team assisting him on his targets.

In some big target raids, you'll even see a tertiary assist named,
but the odds of any plan holding setup long enough to get to
that stage when both the MA and SA are dead are pretty low...
