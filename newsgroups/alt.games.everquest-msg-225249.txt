So I've been doing a number of things recently while sitting at 52 with 
AA on, and I've results.

LDoN is some of the best exp I've seen.  I get between one and a half 
and two and a half yellow per run.  Hard LDoN tends to the low end, 
normal higher, normal with a really hot group the highest.  Mission type 
seems to be irrelevant

Planes suck.  Full group or trio in POI and PON I see maybe one yellow 
in the same time frame as an LDoN group.  Only good experience I've seen 
was when grouped with a level 65; full group in POJ jail I whipped thru 
4 yellow in the same sort of time frame as , and in POD with a 65 pally 
partner I went thru one yellow in a half hour.

Maidens Eye also sucked, gorangas at any rate died slowly and didn't 
yeild much exp per kill at all, either duo, trio, or four man group.

I tried the Hole, too, in a duo with a 46 shaman, we cleared everything 
down to the drop off (didn't pull the tower, did you know that the door 
works now and you can actually go in to the castle et al that way?) and 
had to sit around waiting repop.  Exp unimpressive, down around the one 
yellow per LDoN run duration, if we'd stayed that long.  Did a full 
group running around in there also which gradually turned into an 
attempt at an epic mob only we came close to wiping and evacced, 
summoned the one dead body and called it a night.  About a yellow and a 
half in a LDoN mission timeframe.

Best exp so far outside LDoN has been Velks, again with my shaman 
partner; without her I can't quite handle two pulls and I being a mage I 
have no way to split them.  Nearly two yellow per LDoN run duration, 
twice what I saw in ME or the planes (barring near PLing by a level 65 
something)

Best exp I've done soloing, though, was from 44 to 51 doing the geonids 
and terrors in CC, alone or with a partner, even when half the mobs in 
the run were turning cyan I still was able to clock thru them so fast 
that the exp was coming in at an incredible rate.  Sadly now they are 
almost all green, and being green refuse to drop the Chipped loot, which 
was also some of the best income I've seen.  Between 3 and 3 and a half 
yellow per LDoN run duration... when the two camps are open.  I can't 
really compare this to the other camps though, because I obviously 
wasn't in AA mode, so the line is drawn in a different spot.

What I'm thinking, then, is that what I need is a zone where I can find 
mobs at the very lowest end of exp range; half cyan half blue but will 
be cyan next level; ones that don't come in too large a clump for my 
limited healing abilities to handle, with a nice ZEM.  This is CC 
Geonids to a tee, and also Terrors and even Spiders at the lower levels, 
and before that other of my characters found this with the orcs (I was 
too high level by the time I was running CC to get anything from them).

Bigger, harder mobs die slower, and don't add up to as much.  I was 
shocked to see this applied even in places like the planes, where the 
exp per kill is supposed to be some of the best in the game; perhaps at 
my level the bonus for killing stuff my level hasn't kicked in, but 
killing mobs ranging dark blue to white to yellow in both PoI and PoN 
has really given lackluster reward in the old AA bar.

I'm using my 50 pet to kill hill giants, which are mostly green but some 
cyan; if I'd been doing them at 50 instead of at 52 I bet they'd have 
fit the bill very nicely, they fall down before the 50 pet like dominoes 
in an earthquake simulator.

SO question is, whats barely DB to 52?
