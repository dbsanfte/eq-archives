actually, yes, GLSes are.
they are needed for tailors, to make Wu's Fighting Gauntlets, at the very
least.
just because they're not needed in battle, doesn't make them not a well
known need. I am a tailor-in-training, and am saving all of the GLSes I can
for when I get to the point that I can make Wu's gauntlets, and there may
come a time when I will camp wisps on wisp island specifically for that
purpose. this doesn't make me rude, it doesn't make me a bad person, it just
means that my reason for needing them is different from yours.  doesn't make
it any less of a need though.

there are lots of different reasons players might be killing things that are
green to them. trade skills, spell research, faction, quests...
just because I'm not getting experience for something, doesn't mean I don't
have a right to kill it.
