Go parse.  You'll find you're wrong.  The HP and AC difference is not
signifigant at all, assuming you've appropriate gear for your level (ie
non-twinked).  If you start putting post 50th gear on a 35, then yeah,
you're going to see a signifigant difference ("recommended level" gear
aside); but not with standard pre-50th gear.

I've played ranger right up and I've played SK right up, I know the lack of
difference first hand.  Many people assume that rangers play pre-50th like
they play post-50th, but the difference is so extreme you almost may as well
be playing a different class (even if the change happens fairly gradually).
