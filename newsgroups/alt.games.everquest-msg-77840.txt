  By and large you'll be okay.  All of the non-underground guilds and
guards should be fine with you.  There are a couple other NPCs
sprinkled throughout the town who might attack, but most of these are
very low in level.  Basically approach the beggar types and dark elves
with caution, and don't go wandering around in condemned buildings.
Otherwise you should be fine.
