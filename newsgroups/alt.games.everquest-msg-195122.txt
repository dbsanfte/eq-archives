Are you a citizen?  If you or a friend have a spare character slot, you can
create a Vah Shir mule and have them get their tax certificate from the guy in
the bank.  Then you get your acrylia slate, have mule hand in tax cert and you
hand in slate and go do the rest of the quest.

Nice faction hits for this one, and the slate is used to trigger several other
quests in town (although you might not be able to get anything usuable by a non
Vah Shir, been a long time since I looked at any of this)

Llyric, 57 Vah Shir bard, Morell Thule
Forssake, 13 Iksar Shaman, Terris Thule (hmm, maybe I should go do this myself,
although I've nothing against Cabalis)
