Its situational, depends if im checking for see invis mobs... or
checking the faction standing with the particular mobs...
Do I read it every time.. no, do I read it alot, yes...  did I have
issues reading the Blue con message prior to patch?  yep... 

I do wish it was configurable, for those that are unhappy with the
change... but for me... Im happy about it.. (one of my nit picks for
quite some time)
