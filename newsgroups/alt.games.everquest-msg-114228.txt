I really don't think anyone here is against helping those in need, or
maybe more specifically, *those who help themselves*. I guess the term
"in need" is subjective to some extent. I don't think begging for
something that merely makes the game easier for you is "in need".
However, if that griffon that ganked you in WC is camping your corpse,
you can bet I'll help out any way I can and as soon as I can.

However, far too many people start a new character planning on taking
advantage of the abilities/resources of others. It never occurs to
them NOT to beg. That's just sad.
