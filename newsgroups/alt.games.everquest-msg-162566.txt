}I'm looking for some information on the specifics of DKP systems that

On a slightly separate but related topic, my guild is trying a new loot 
system, andI'm wondering what you all think of it.  Here's the plan:

Phat_Lewt_001 drops.
Harokin tells the raid, "Anyone interested in Phat_Lewt_001 send me a tell"
Harokin tells the raid, "Ok, So Zinny Crep Toad and Lorellei want it."

Zinphandel, Creper, Toadwort, and Lorellei all roll 1 100

The high roller chooses which of the other rollers it should be awarded to.

It means we all have the opportunity to be the loot officer at some point and 
see how miserable a job it is.  It neatly avoids having to set points values 
to things.

Has anyone else tried a system like this?  If so, what problems did it 
unleash?
