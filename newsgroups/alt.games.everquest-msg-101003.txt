A number of people have raised the issue of "if we're paying more,
then we should get more". There's a flaw with that line of thinking,
though.

No one has refuted that inflation has occurred, that utility, rent,
and employer costs have gone up. And in three years, the monthly cost
of the game has *not* gone up. In other words, the subscription cost
is less now than it was three years ago, when looked at in light of
the operating costs.

So now the subscription cost is going up, and some people are asking
"what improvements do we get for this higher price". They're missing
the point.

Perhaps a better question would be "what aspect of the service would
have to be reduced if the monthly fee *didn't* go up?"

This may not be a "new improvements" price hike, but rather a
"maintenance" price hike.

I think the price hike is going to be utterly forgotten by the vast
majority of players. And the SoL technical issues will be given the
same indifference as the startup problems - having been fixed, no one
will care about them any more.
