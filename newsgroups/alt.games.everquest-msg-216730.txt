That's all they guarentee to hold it for.  In reality, they so far have
never deleted old characters, other than an occasional announced purge of
level characters that haven't been played in a while.

If *I* were running the game, I'd have a character export feature.  When you
delete a character, the server would take all the character data, sign it
with a private key, compute an MD5 or similar checksum, and download the
signed data to your computer.  The server would keep a list of valid
checksums.  That would be kept forever, as it is small (16 bytes per
character--note that there is no need to keep anything except the checksum,
since anything else you need, like the account the character belongs to,
what server it is on, and anything like that, can be in in the exported
character file).

For a fee, probably $5, I'd have a character import option, which allows you
to upload an exported character, if the signature checks out and the
checksum of the uploaded data matches on of the saved checksums.  The
uploaded character goes back to your active set, and its checksum is removed
from the checksum list.

This shifts the data storage responsibility to the end user.  All Sony needs
to be able to do is keep that list of checksums.  It does assume somewhat
sane design of things like the character and item databases, so that they
can reasonably import old characters.
