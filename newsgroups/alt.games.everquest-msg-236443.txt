Yes, whenever I hear from anyone who's played it about Anarchy Online 
they always rave about its excellence. I've certainly gotten the 
impression that is in fact a very good game. But I'm not really into a 
sci-fi setting. Even before we all came to know about the failure of 
SWG, I didn't care much as I wasn't interested in playing it anyway. I 
enjoy the medieval fantasy worlds mostly or things like it. I guess this 
is kind of strange where I was always such a Star Trek fan and did like 
the first 3 Star Wars movies. Who knows, maybe I will try it sometime 
and find that I am wrong about not liking sci-fi. Maybe in an excellent 
game I would.

But for now I am going to play DAoC and give AC2 a spin as well. That'll 
keep me plenty busy.
