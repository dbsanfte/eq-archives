Very true, we dont really solo for a hill of beans=)

Look up the recipe for Leather Padding in tailoring. Notice the 
different types of skins and silks used for it. Go forth and kill lots 
of critters and loot the silks and skins. Get a sewing kit and make 
padding. Get a couple of traders satchels and stand in bazaar selling 
padding for 25-50 pp each [different servers have different base costs 
on tradeskill suplies like this.]

Look up the recipe for Cod Oil in brewing. You will need a pack or 2 of 
bait, and a few fishing poles, and donate for a port to Cobalt Scar. 
Park yourself by the othmir merchants on the beach and start fishing. 
Sell anything that isnt cobalt cod to the othmirs, and make sure that 
you have food so you dont eat your cod. Gate back to PoK or a zone of 
your choice that has a brewing barrel and get water. make cod oil and 
sell it in the bazaar for 25-50 pp per oil. Most people use something 
innocuous to bring up their brewing skills such as short beer to 31, 
short ale to 51, and cod oil will take you to 68 =)

<note, I would try to scrounge the plat together to get the bones to 
make a fishermans companion as you can just summon fishing poles 
whenever yours breaks. on sol ro, the bones are about 100 plat each]

The padding is always a moneymaker because tradeskillers going for the 
higher levels in armoring need padding, and it can be a royal pain 
farming the stuff for it and many prefer to just buy them in bazaar and 
avoid the farming entirely.

Set aside a time to set up your character as a bazaar trader - i find it 
is great if I am not really into grouping, and want to do some sort of 
tradeskill combines and talk with friends. I also will leave my mule set 
up overnight on weekends and get the people coming in off raids who 
decide to go shopping=)

Tell your groupmates that you are not made of plat, this is your main 
and not an alt and you dont have the plat to pop for dots for everybody. 
  Most people can understand being poor, and dont mind flipping the 
cleric some cash for temperence. Some groups have the custom of the 
cleric gets the first one or 2 gems that drop as recompense for the 
dots. I can *highly* recommend getting the group temperence spell in 
north ro, well worth the adventure points. makes casting cheaper, group 
for 2 dots total is a good deal.

If you play on sol ro, let me know - I can give you the fish for the 
fishing pole quest=)
