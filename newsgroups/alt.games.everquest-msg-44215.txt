Are you serious?  I've zoned into Chardok and run through it numerous
times without a group.  Sure, on my first or second time there I zoned
in I didn't have an invis song up and got spotted immediately, but
even a wimpy bard was able to run to the zone-out.  Also, I've never
seen a pick-up good in Chardok on Innoruuk.  It's 100% bring your own
group, and not because of the zone in/out, it's just a tough zone if
you don't know the people you're fighting with.  However, they have
been making changes to it on Test, so it may be getting the Velks Lab
treatment.
As to Sebilis, is it *ever* not permantly camped?  I'm serious, I
don't think I've ever zoned in and seen less than 6 people sitting at
zone.  OK, maybe once at 7am EST on a Tuesday or something.  I've run
out of Seb many times, and several times with the upper zoneout mobs
up, never done any real damage to me.  
The point is that both of them have slightly tough, non-standard zone
in/out areas, yet one is completely camped all the time and the other
is 100% byog.  From your own examples I don't think that the zone
in/out has much to do with getting folks to explore new dungeons.
