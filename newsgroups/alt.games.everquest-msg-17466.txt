Don't go in the front castle entrance, sneak in the "secret" back
entrance behind the graveyard.  Go up the staircase, hang a left,
and set up camp in the room with the two Gargoyles in the
wall alcoves.  You'll be one room away from the "bath" where
Xicotl spawns (it looks like a hot tub...).

Pull to the gargoyle room, and keep the "bath" clear, eventually
Xicotl will show up, he's a big ugly Troll Shadow Knight.

If you get swarmed (by anything), run back along the hall at
the top of the stair, go PAST the stairway, running straight
down the hall until you find yourself on a short "bridge" leading
to the "tower".  Leap OFF the bridge to the left, and you'll
land pretty much at the bottom of the ramp which leads down
from the LFay zone line.  Run up it to safety and zone out.  This
is an excellent "short cut" out of Mistmoore, and any mobs chasing
you will take the "long way around", down the stairs, through
the graveyard, and around, so it'll buy you some time to make it
to the zone line.  But they WILL come for you, so don't sit at
the top of the ramp thinking they've forgotten about you,
because by the time they arrive, they'll have brought 30 of
their friends with them...

And how did you get your Armor of Ro if you haven't been to
Mistmoore before?
