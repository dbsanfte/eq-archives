/shrug

In EQ1 Pre-Kunark there were really was only one or two sets of items 
worth having for any given class at the higher levels. You could spot a 
bard a mile away in Lambent...

It wasn't really until beyond Velious that people really started 
differentiating. And that's largely the result of there simply being 
that much stuff out there, and the fact that being 70th level doesn't 
mean you are hunting in the same zones as every other 70th level ... 
which used to be true pre-Luclin.
