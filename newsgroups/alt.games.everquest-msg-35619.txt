I see it as more of a harmonious existance. Druids are in tune with
nature and the circle of life. There is an understanding that
sometimes it is necissary to kill to survive. Death is a part of life.
What the friendly faction is is an understanding that the druid will
not harm the animal unecissarily (for sport or whatnot) and the animal
will not harm the druid for any reason other than self defence.
