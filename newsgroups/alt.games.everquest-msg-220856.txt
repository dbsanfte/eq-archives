Sadly no, slaughtered tons of alligators but all I ever got was
the stein and the shovel; the shovel does almost nothing but the
stein is certainly nice, water pet with the HP of an earth pet is
a good thing.  Air pet would be good, giving him HP of a water
pet, but torch?  Air pet HP isn't all that impressive, the nice
thing about him is he doesn't get hit all that much, the fire pet
-does- get hit lots though, having the HP of an air pet doesnt'
seem like it would make much difference.

That said, I haven't tried fire pets in ages and they may well
work differently at higher levels, for example I don't solo reds
much anymore! 

How good is the fire pet DS, its handy not to have to cast it, of
course, but is the damage also higher?  Do we know how much
higher?

Depends how much the tanks are getting hit versus how much time
they spend between fights.  I'm also finding that the tanks like
to play "juggle the aggro" at this level, instead of "main tank"
they are all getting some of the beating.  This means that to get
the mob hurt for every swing it connects with, I'd have to DS
everyone.  Lacking a group DS, thats not going to be a good use
of mana. I like DS conceptually, its just difficult to implement
at these levels, people don't behave like they do in their 50s
when the mobs are a lot more serious.  At 39 I didn't bat an
eyelash when the whole group ran off to POK book to do something
or other, I just stayed put and kept pulling and killing; the
rest of the group was a convenience but in no way necessary for
me to keep the slaughter up.

Could give them all my summoned items, which seem to have AC and
hp on them.  As a former cleric, I'm afraid I'm not a big
believer in AC, though, by and large it doesn't seem to do much
except in very large increments.  Maybe with a cleric AC buff
(looks around for Teapray) and a full kit of summoned plate and
every AC item I can summon (except the bracers, which will be
overwritten by the plate bracers) I'll see enough of a change to
make it worth while though.

Same frequency for less damage is actually a big help for the
fire pet or cast DS on pet strategy; I wouldn't -want- the pet to
get hit less often but for the same damage.

Splendid
