Yeah, I know, I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it after the brownie
incident the night before.

And there was the fact that he sent me a tell from akanon while I was in
Lfay, then said something about a corpse in Gfay, while wanting a port to
Misty, I didn't want to fuck around for him, I learned my lesson one time
when I ported a guy from WC to BB and then he wanted me to wait around for
15 minutes while he sold a robe to a guy (who wasn't in zone when I ported
in) and then port him back.  The stupid part was that I actually waited for
him.
