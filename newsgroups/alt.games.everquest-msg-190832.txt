Last night i were helping a druid ranger do a part of his epic. We were 
in Butcherblock, and he just needed his final handin in Burning Woods 
(and its still not moved), so loaded up my trusty succor spell to 
Skyfire. Cast the spell, and the ranger is ported there, but IM left in BB.
Had a port to EJ leave a party member back once in my whole EQ play 
time, but never heard that succor spells could leave yourself behind.
Anyone got a clue to what happened?
