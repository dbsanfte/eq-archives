I figure that I'm probably included in your list, and you're not
wrong. I usually KF obvious offenders right away instead of goading
them, but lately I haven't done that.

I've corrected it just now, though, with several new additions to my
KF (none of which are you, by the way - the new KF residents know who
they are, but will no doubt continue to respond to my posts anyway).

Thank you for your patience during the redecorating. :)
