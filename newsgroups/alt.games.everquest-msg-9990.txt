Nope, that's the beauty of hide/sneak for a rogue. It's the only form of
invisibility that DOES keep you safe from undead and the living at the same
time.

Zone into Befallen.
Sneak/Hide over to the locked door of your choice and stand next to the
wall near the door hinges (to be out of everyone's way when they come
barreling through with a train).
Get the lockpicks on your cursor and hold them near the hinge point of the
door (so you don't have to move your cursor to shut the door).
Click "u" several thousand times (while watching television, etc)  Open,
close, open, close...

Oh, make sure you've trained the skill up to 11 points at a trainer before
starting "field training".
