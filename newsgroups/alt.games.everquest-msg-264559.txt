Combat should be fun. The game Black & White was innovative. ;-)  Innovative 
is good when it moves the meter in a forward direction, not when it adds 
quirky things just to add things. Innovative winds up in a museum. Fun winds 
up on my computer. Every once in a while you find combinations of the two 
(e.g., Civilization) and life is good. But it's pretty rare.

That being said, EQ2 is rather short on innovation, I don't see a lot of 
terribly original ideas. Mostly they've invested what they've learned from 
their experience with MMOGs and doubled up the production values for this 
game. Better graphics, better sounds, better voice-overs, better encounters, 
better controls over griefers, kill-stealers and macroers, richer content 
for crafters and adventurers. It seems like their intent was to enhance the 
kind of stuff that makes the game more playable and enjoyable for EverQuest 
players. There are lots of holes still and I'm not sure the Nov 8 ship date 
was a good decision with all that's left to do. If they screw the pooch on 
this, they have only themselves to blame. But yeah, innovation wasn't the 
driving design decision, that's pretty apparent.

As for "stealing" old ideas, you aren't claiming that FFXI originated any of 
those ideas are you? I haven't played FFXI because it doesn't sound very 
appealing to me so I really don't know anything about the game. From 
descriptions I've read it sounded pretty derivative. Most of the people I 
know who did try it, left and decribed the experience as one of the dullest 
and mind-numbing they'd ever experienced. One of my partners from SWG went 
right into FFXI. We both agreed that SWG sucked but he said this was even 
worse. (!) Also, he found it somewhat annoying that there were no North 
American servers, they were all in Japan, where the game had been out a year 
before Americans were allowed in, so when he arrived all he saw were 
Japanese players running around with maximum gear at maximum level. He was a 
noob and an American, which he claimed were two fatal strikes against him in 
the social order. Finally, he could not play with a friend of his who 
started on a different server unless he *paid* to transfer the character, 
because the design of this system did not allow you to choose where you 
started. Now there's innovation! lol
