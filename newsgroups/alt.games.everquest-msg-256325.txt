Probably just when they were adding it. Compared to the other epics, the
bezerker epic already has pretty disgusting stats.  Making the haste spell
based would be pushing it well into the obscene catagory.

Standard actually for epic weapons with haste.  Only the monk epic gives an
instant click spell haste, the rogue, ranger and bezerker epics are all item
haste.

The attack counts against your worn attack limit, rather than blocking any
spells from landing.  This too is standard on the epics which have an attack
component.

The warrior epic worn effect is increase dex by 40, increase AC by 12.
So... 7 on a chain class isn't really out of line.

Reading over the quest, I'm not sure it isn't.  It appears roughly as
difficult as the bezerker epic, for an item which compares favorably to
bazaar gear. (Something that cannot be said for the old epics.)

I mean, I understand the reason behind it being so good, but it's still
pretty disgusting to look at the stats on it and the quest, and then think
about how much time and effort went into getting my own sadly outdated epic.

Thats the one possible brightspot in OOW, the possiblity that the other
classes epics will get upgraded to v1.5 relatively easily, to reward all the
effort that did go into them.  v2.0, which would upgrade epics back to
"Wow!" status I would expect to be out of reach to the average player for
several expansions.   If it even does upgrade them that much.  (Anyone have
any pre-release stats?)
