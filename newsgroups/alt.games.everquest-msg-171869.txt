So you've been around a while, and you played on The Nameless server?  Then
you should remember the GM event of August 2000, where a rogue GM (or guide,
forgot which) began to summon random LV50+ players into Veshan's Peak, a few
were bound there for death loops, and a REALLY BIG mess was made.  Also
about the same time (I know for sure this happened on Nameless) where
someone figured out a duplication bug which involved a player placing items
in the trade window, then canceling the trade but the other player ended up
with all items & coin.  A few extreamly rare items were suddonly common.
Players having a few Kpp after just a day or few days.  Took a few weeks to
track all of it down, MANY people were banned (those involved in the
exploit/bug/hack).
    Anyone else remember these events?
