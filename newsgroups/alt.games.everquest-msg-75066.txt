I still would have taken the pot room.  Particularly given that you have
levi and camo and sow.  Levi and sow yourself, run to the pot room,
n12000,n4200 I think, second number might be positive, camo yourself, port
to Cabilis, zone to other Cabilis zone, exit to FoB, run to WW.
Alternatively, you could have run to the Ogre Island in TD, and taken the
boat to OT, then zoned into WW from there.  With the Nexus now, I rarely use
those tricks.
