You know, everyone says that. And I've no doubt it can be true, happens,
is in their loot table, etc. But it doesn't seem to be our luck. We've
killed a metric buttload of those FG's, especially while helping people

Then again, I'm the guy who rolled a 546 on a /random 540 1000 for the
last piece of corroded plate that dropped in Kael, so go figure.
