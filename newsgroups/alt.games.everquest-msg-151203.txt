Elaboration as follows:
We'll use soloing as an example. One on one. Pure int and Wis casters...

Cleric - Has higher DPS than most paladins now and capable of same ac. No
other caster can boast this.
Druid - Only class to boast a dependable 11 minute snare. nuff said
Enchanter - Weak pet that doesnt listen to shit but still will retain aggro
for the 5 seconds for gate to go off.
Mage - Pet, choice of 4 actually... need i say more?
Necro - Life Tapping pet... need i say more?
Shammy - Pet, not sure about particulars here but i have seen shammys solo
reds before.
Beastlords - Why say anything? we all know what they solo like with their
warders.

So there it is. Now lets take a wizard. Hell we'll use me for instance.
Level 52 Wizard. Single pulls mob. Hill Giant in RM.
Snare, run, run, SoTF, Ice Comet, run, run, Ice Comet, run, DoF(draught of
fire). mob dead. Fast easy kill right? Not hardly. You have used roughly 1/2
your mana maybe less but not by much. Wizard have to be constantly on the
move because once you cast IC root is going break then a green hill giant is
going to have his way with you... and no nothing will repair that hole in
the back of your robe where your arse used to be covered.
Enchanters are really the only ones i see having an issue here versus that
particular mob.
All the other ones have pets with the exception of clerics and they have
that hammer now.

Thanks.
