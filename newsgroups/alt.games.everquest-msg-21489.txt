I had to put one person on ignore... and removed him from it about 30
minutes later.

I has to ignore him because he was standing next to me, flooding me with
"makes a rude gesture"  and duel requests.

Text was scrolling by so fast that I couldn't converse with my group (of
which he actually was a member).  So I /ignored him.  Then explained to him
that he was probably the stupidest person I've ever encountered.  To this
day, (nearly a year later) he remains the only person I've /ignored.
