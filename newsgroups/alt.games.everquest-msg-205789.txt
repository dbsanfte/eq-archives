I play Human Druid, have hardly used wolfform since I made 39 and got
Spirit of Ash which reduces my downtime noticeably solo (grouped I am
usually in a dungeon, so can't use wolfform then either).  Amusingly
enough, Spirit of Ash appears to give you infravision.  My biggest
complaint about being Human atm is that lightsources are badly hosed
in various places in many zones, indoors and out.  It's pretty lame
when you have to unequip one or more lightsources in order to see.
