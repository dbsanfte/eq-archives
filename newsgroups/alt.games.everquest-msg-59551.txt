In the first month of release of course the people who can put 12
hours a day playing in powerlevelled groups are going to gank lower
leveled casual players. Of course. A ten level difference means less
at higher levels. A level 40 versus a level 50 is much closer then a
level 40 versus a level 30. Or a level 30 versus a 20. The game is not
mature yet and will take a good 3-4 months to get mature.  Even then
yes there will always be lowbies who wander around. They choose to
take that risk. Once the servers are mature and a significant portion
of the population has gotten to the 30's and 40's, it will be far less
likely for those gank and runs to occur.
