   Pick the server. Anyone can come in here and portray a real life =
badass and think more of himself. Bring it to a server and let me =
humiliate you till a GM bans one of us. I notice I don't see any of you =
on Drinal or Rallos talking this crap. Why? because just like Lokari, =
you fear me in game, you fear the embarrassment you will suffer.

   So, pick a server.  If ya got balls.

   Now, you have two choices.

  1) You can reply how immature this challenge is and how it wont prove =
anything, thus boosting your ego, only impressing yourself to a level =
that you can tell your wife how your so bad cause you showed GetsumJ.

  or

  2) Create any character (Toon), bring it to a server (PVP), and try =
and be a man. I'll train ya, bash ya, and probably make you crawl back =
to the NG telling people how stupid the challenge was so you left. =
(coughcoughpussy)

   If you show your pathetic faces, I not only will be surprised, but =
I'll leave the NG. No new names, no more bash. People probably get tired =
of it in here so take it to the game.


  PS - SK,Avenger, and any other names you accuse me of using are a joke =
and very false.

  You want me out? then show up. You don't show, then you must really =
love to read my stuff. Put up, or Shut up. Spare the NG
