Welcome to EverQuest: Depths of Darkhollow!
-------------------------------------------

As Lanys T'Vyl and Firiona Vie crossed blades in Nektulos Forest, a failed 
curse exploded that shook the lands from sky to stone.  When all settled, 
for a time there was no sound.  Firiona, Lanys, their armies, all the beasts 
and creatures had vanished from the grove where the curse was bound.  But 
down at the end of the forest river where it ducked under loose stone, a way 
into darkness was revealed -- passage into a subterranean world called 
Darkhollow.

For more details on what befell those in Nektulos Forest, see today's story 
entry!


~** Depths of Darkhollow Highlights **~


** Monster Missions **

- Have you ever wondered what it must be like to be a monster in Norrath? 
Now you can find out! Through Monster Missions, you are able to enter the 
bodies of a variety of characters and be transported into a different time 
to re-enact the past or play a critical role in Norrath's future. These 
missions are found in Darkhollow and other areas around Norrath, like 
Nektulos Forest and Butcherblock.
- While you play in a monster mission, your main character earns experience 
and, quite often, rewards!  The rewards you gain from monster missions 
appear in the inventory of your main character when the mission is 
successfully completed.


** Spirit Shrouds **

- Shroudkeepers have learned to channel spirits in the ethereal world.  They 
are found in the Plane of Knowledge and can offer you the form of one of 
Norrath's creatures through a Spirit Shroud! The Shroudkeepers can transform 
you into creatures in various categories, like Undead or Animal. The Spirit 
Shroud itself changes your form and gives you a specific set of abilities, 
like a fighter or healer, depending on the shroud you picked. Once you've 
selected a shroud type, you can choose to play a creature of that type of 
any available level less than or equal to your own level.
- While you adventure with a Spirit Shroud, you will gain experience for 
your main character.  When you remove your shroud, the items you collected 
will appear in your Shroud Storage which is accessed at a banker.  Also, as 
you use the Spirit Shrouds in a particular category you will gain enough 
knowledge and experience to unlock new forms.


** Evolving Items **

- As you adventure and advance in Norrath, you may find new items that will 
learn and grow right along with you!  These Evolving Items change over time 
the more you use them, including their names and statistics.  These weapons 
and worn items are marked as Evolving and will show their status in a 
percentage upon inspecting them. You can watch that status grow as you kill 
monsters!  When it reaches 100 percent, presto, you will have the next level 
of your item!


** Intelligent Items **

- Imagine what some of your gear might say to you if it could talk.  Now 
some will!  Intelligent items, much like evolving items, are now found in 
Norrath and will show their status when inspected. As they grow, they change 
their statistics and even what they say.  They can talk to you and, 
sometimes, people around you (you can customize these chat options).  These 
items usually have something to say about your actions, so keep your eyes 
open!


** Tradeskills **

- The gnomes of Corathus have amassed a collection of new tradeskill items. 
You will find some vendors with books detailing javelins, food and drink, 
and new ways of doing spell research.  Merchants who frequently traffic in 
high quality ore have been taking a keen interest in the new ores and 
minerals of Darkhollow and often have surplus available for purchase by 
others.
- The new spell research is a totally different system that covers a large 
majority of spells that were found in Planes of Power, and Gates of Discord, 
though not all of them.  The new system may seem more complex than the way 
you are used to doing spells, but is much more systematic than the previous 
system and will be more consistent.
- Additionally, there are new highly powerful augments for cultural armor. 
One of the Gnomeworks is a bit damaged and if you have something of interest 
to him, he may be willing to help you with a way to make them. Good luck!


** AAs **

- New AAs are now available to players who own Depths of Darkhollow.


** Spells **

- New Spells are now available to players who own Depths of Darkhollow

~** Other Update News **~

** [EQ] Menu Button **

- We have added new functionality to the UI.  The window selector is no 
longer available. The functionality is now neatly folded and tucked away in 
the [EQ] Button. Clicking on the [EQ] button will extend a menu that 
includes the most vital and commonly used screens in the game.


** AAs **

- Based on player feedback, we've changed the way that Turn Undead and Turn 
Summoned work to make it more useful in normal grouping situations.  Both 
abilities have been refunded and new versions are available for purchase. 
The new versions are 5-minute reuse, single-target DoTs that have a chance 
to do a massive amount of damage to the targeted creature when they land, 
likely destroying it in one hit.  The core abilities are still level 59 
class abilities and upgrades are available at level 65 for Planes of Power 
and level 70 with Depths of Darkhollow.
- Due to the changes to Turn Summoned and Turn Undead, the AAs that 
decreased their reuse times are no longer applicable so they have been 
removed and refunded.
- The duration of Divine Avatar has been increased to 3 minutes and the 
reuse time has been lowered to 36 minutes.
- The reuse time on Rabid Bear has been reduced to 36 minutes. As part of 
this change, the ability will no longer have its duration increased by focus 
effects.  Hastened Rabidity has been changed to lower the reuse on Rabid 
Bear by 4 minutes per rank.
- Reduced the casting time on Wake the Dead and Army of the Dead.
- Rhythmic Reflexes and Superior Rhythmic Reflexes had their double attack 
values switched. This has now been corrected.



** Tradeskills **

- Added some recipes to create Soy Sauce for the Chef Chowderly quest.
- Modified the stats on numerous pieces of the Cultural Tradeskill armor.
- The Salvage bug when using world containers has been fixed.
- Tradeskill recipes that result in a LORE item that you already have and is 
not a tool will now block with a message.


** NPCs **

- High quality ore vendors will no longer fall for your tricks.
- Volkara will now appear as a spider rather than a 20-foot human male.
- NPC's in Halls of Honor should no longer gate home when there are too many 
pets in the nearby vicinity.
- Made a minor modification to the Mata Muram script to fix a loophole in 
the gaze list logic.


** Missions & Events **

- Volkara will no longer grow in power if she is outside of her lair.  Her 
encounter will now be the same no matter where she is fought.
- Kessdona's manashard guardian adds should now activate correctly and in 
sequence.
- Changed the required count for the kill and loot elements on the Dragons 
of Norrath mission "Diseased Pumas". This change was to fix a discrepancy 
between the number of items required for task completion compared to the 
number of kills and items looted that the task said you needed.


** Quests **

- The Ancient Sebilite Protector in Sebilis should no longer double-spawn 
his helper-golems, and the event should despawn / reset normally again.


** Items **

- All arrows and throwing items now are max stack size of 100.


** Spells **

- Modified Intensity of the Resolute so it won't be overwritten by other, 
lesser abilities.


** Tutorial **

- In case you missed it above, the tutorial has changed. Not only have we 
added new content and made it more user friendly and streamlined, we 
actually made it a standalone experience you can give to your friends to 
learn how to play EverQuest. Please refer to the EverQuest: Escape To 
Norrath website for more details: 
http://escapetonorrath.station.sony.com/index.vm


** UI **

- There are now 4 Hotbutton windows that can be visible at the same time. 
Use the Options window to set keys for showing/hiding the windows, as well 
as setting keys for the individual Hotbuttons in them.  Note to skinners, 
your old skin should work for the single Hotbutton window contained in it, 
but you'll need to update to see more than 1.
- Item Links have changed format.
- Bazaar search results, when the item is viewed, should now show the 
correct number of charges for charged items.
- The Task Select window now autoselects the first task in the list.
- The Guild Management Window level display bug should be fixed.
- Changing video modes should no longer clear the Find window list.
- The Find Window now generates a Find path once a target is selected.


** Miscellaneous **

- Added new level gained text for lower level characters.
