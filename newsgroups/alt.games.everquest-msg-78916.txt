I would imagine hes hunting the seafury cyclops's.
I dont think these guys are worth the effort... too many hp for their con.
They have roughly twice the hp of a HG.
Another possibility is dino (alewzaur), but again, hes just not worth the
effort (14k hp about)
Mobs in bw and skyfire have less hp for their con.
