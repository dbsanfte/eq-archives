Hey all. Thinking of dusting off my 58 bard for a while, and thought I 
might start an EQ blog with a bard feel. Now, I'm certainly no Richard 
Lawson by any stretch (anyone know if he has a blog, btw?), but hey, I've 
been thinking I may have something to contribute to this whole blogging 
craze and thought what the heck.

So, in an effort to promote the use of blogs as they relate to EQ through 
simple consolidation, I was wondering if anyone else out there also has a 
blog in which they post EQ anecdotes and such.

Any other bloggers out there? What blog site do you use? Additionally, does 
anyone know of any other blogs of related interest?

Blog. (nod to the film "Super Troopers")
