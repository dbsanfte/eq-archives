Hi everyone:

Can someone please advise me how best to start off my tradeskills? I have
just made level 54 and have so far not really been interested in
tradeskills, but the Coldain Shawl quest in the Eastern Wastelands require
skills in certain trades. I currently have 262 practice points available to
spend, I raise my skills by actually using them - However, tradeskills are a
wee bit different. I don't *have* to put one point into tailoring to
kick-start it do I? I'm assuming I can just buy a sewing kit and place two
silks in it and combine, thus starting my skill. Assuming that I *don't*
have to invest one point to kick-start it, when I do my first combine (or
second) I'll raise my skill to *one* - Would I be better to place one
practice point into a skill, even though it isn't really necessary, I'm
wondering if placing one point into it will start the skill off at a
*higher* level than one ..

Thank you, as always for your time, safe hunting to you all ..

Stevie.
