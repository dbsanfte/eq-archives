Cool. So I don't need to worry about that.

(Of course, nerd that I am, I've been having a ball fishing for dollars
in AkAnon all night. To make the time productive, I've been maxing out
my Sense Heading skill during casts and having my wife talk Elvish at
me at the same time. That 133 intelligence really pays off in these
sorts of situations.)

Hey, I did something right! I've been getting everyone to speak their
foreign language to me a few times. I'm going to start swapping fish
for language lessons soon. I figure even newbies from outside of AkAnon
can help me while I help them.
