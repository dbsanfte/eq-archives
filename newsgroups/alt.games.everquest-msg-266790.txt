Actually, that's the correct price based on the membership option you've 
chosen.  In this case, you selected a membership of 3 months.  $99 x 3 = 
$2.97.  $2.99 x 3 = $8.97.

So, if you choose all EQ2 Players options on a 3 month membership, you'll be 
charged $8.97 every 3 months.

It threw me for a loop when I first saw it too, until I tried a little math.
