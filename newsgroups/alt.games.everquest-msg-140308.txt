I love my enchanter pet now.  It is actually, really and truly useful for
xping.  I always have him around when I'm soloing, which so far has been all
the time except for one unfortunate pickup group.

My shamans pet is extremely useful now in soloing situations.  I just have
to be a little picky about the blue mobs I go after with him.  Some are
still better to just root and rot, but others are quite easy to deal with
with my pet.  He will never be a necro or mage pet, but still, compared to
certain other pets out there....
