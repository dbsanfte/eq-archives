My necromancer is level 31 and started in Paineel, before the Warrens
existed.  He stayed in toxx only until 4 and has never done anything
meaningful in a dungeon.  As a a pet caster with fear kiting a major part of
his arsenal, he is much more effective outdoors.  I have tried many other
classes and none have been as fun for me as the necromancer. I almost regret
taking the time off from him to level my other characters, he'd be at 40
something by now.
