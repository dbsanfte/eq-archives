The following types of names are unacceptable and are listed in order from
the worst to the least offensive:

1. Vile, profane, rude, or racist names including common swear words,
anatomical references, racial slurs, and homonyms of these words.
2. Combinations of words that produce an offensive result (e.g. Hugeaz, Tug
Mcgroin).
3. Names of religious, occult, or significant historic origin (e.g. Jesus,
Allah, Satan, Stalin).
4. Copyrighted or trademarked names of products, characters, services, or
concepts (e.g. Drizzt, Marlboro, Sony).
5. Non-fantasy oriented names from popular media. These names can be either
fictional (e.g. Rambo, Darthvader) or non-fictional (e.g. Garth Brooks,
Pierce Brosnan, Ronald Reagan, Michael Jordan).
6. Common words and phrases that would not be found in the place and time
setting of the game (e.g. Switchblade, Phaser, Toaster, Cannabis, Sloegin,
Anyone).
7. Proper names from EverQuest (e.g. Rathe, Karana). This also includes the
first or last name of any significant EverQuest NPC (e.g. Dorn, Trumpy,
Karn).
8. The names of senior Customer Support Representatives or employees of SOE
or Sony Entertainment (e.g. Absor, Abashi, Aradune)
9. Names chosen with the intent or possessed with the effect of harming the
reputation of a player or Customer Service Representative.
10. Names containing titles within them, such as, but not limited to: The,
Lord, Lady, Master, King, Knight, Sir, Father (e.g. Sirtallon, Lordeagle,
Mothermaggy, Darksister).
11. Names that contain sentences (Ikillorcs), phrases (Ontop), or two or
more words that do not form descriptive compound words (Petcarbob, Diediedie
and Tablechair). Descriptive compound words are allowed in first names and
are encouraged in surnames (e.g. Treehugger, Giantslayer). Descriptive
compound words (each separate part of the word and the entire word) must
otherwise adhere to all other naming rules.
12. Fantasy-oriented names that are easily recognized from popular existing
media (e.g. Merlin, Gandalf, Belgarath, Tanis).
13. Names where the combination of the first and last name form a phrase or
violate a previous rule (e.g. Crymea River, Bran Muffin, Story Thyme)

For all of the above, misspellings and alternative spellings of the word or
words are also unacceptable.

Looking at number 11, that would appear to clearly indicate that they did
not want someone naming a character with a sentance or phrase, this clearly
makes "wantsomedrinks" a violation of the naming policy.  You might be able
to get by with Heavydrinker.  They clearly meant to exclude far more than
copyrighted, trademarked, or offensive names.  Just read the rules.
