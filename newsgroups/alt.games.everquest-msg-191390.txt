That would be awesome.

I think that looting the way it is is fine, but if a mob drops a NODROP 
item, the loot timer should go to 10 minutes before anyone but the raid 
leader / assigned looter can loot it, and 12 minutes until corpse poof. 

Normal loot can be tossed in a bag for distribution later- nodrop must be 
rolled/bought, etc.

I don't raid anywhere near as much or as high as a lot of these guys, but 
IMO that would help a lot.
