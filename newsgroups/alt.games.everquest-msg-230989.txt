Was in an ME group in my 50's with a group of mages with an epic
or 2 and air pets - I'm not sure the mobs actually got to swing
more than a few times :).

I'm very happy with my new 62 warder with Spirit of Storm,
mage belt and IoS on him in conjunctionn with my air pet - 
seems a lot of stunning is going on.
