I was getting this sort of error all the time with a Soyo mobo (5EMA+),
an SBLive Value and a Creative Geforce 2 MX (maybe a similar card to
yours - I don't know). This happened regularly since the 30/5 patch
(when they updated to DX7). I eventually gave up and got a new
motherboard and CPU (and very nice the game is on a 1.2GHz Tbird, too :)

I'd assumed it was a video card problem, since the Graphics DLL was
crashing, but I actually narrowed it down on my system to the SBLive
card - would still crash with a blank text file called nosound.txt in
the EQ folder (so the game runs with sound disabled), but not with the
card physically removed from the PC. I tried lots of stuff, had it in
different slots, on different IRQs, ensured that my graphics card, sound
card and network card all had their own IRQ that they weren't sharing
with anything, tried clean installs of Windows and EQ, various versions
of Direct X and drivers for everything, tried using a cheapo alternative
soundcard, etc, etc, all to no avail.

I wouldn't mind betting your motherboard uses a VIA chipset like my old
one. It seems that certain VIA chipsets have big problems with some
soundcards, particularly the SBLive which is a real IRQ hog, and
something about changing the DX support in EQ has caused this bug to
manifest. VIA think they've fixed it with their new 4-in-1 chipset
drivers, but that didn't help me (nor did the various unofficial patches
floating around).

All I can suggest is to ensure you have the latest drivers for
everything - your soundcard (It doesn't help that the latest drivers for
the SBLive are over a year old), video card (use NVidia's reference
drivers, currently v12.41, rather than the vendor's ones), at least
Direct X 7.0a (you could try 8.0a, but its a bitch to go back if there's
problems and VI don't officially support it). If they don't help, try
looking at things like your mobo chipset drivers, whether anything is
sharing an IRQ (particularly your sound and video cards), whether your
bios needs updating, etc.

Also, run dxdiag and msinfo32 (start:run:dxdiag or start:run:msinfo32)
and post the all the info from dxdiag and the relevant info from
msinfo32 (basically the stuff about what is using what IRQ - not the
reams and reams of anal detail about everything on your PC). That way,
the techier types here may have something more to go on.
