I was being more general here, I'll admit that in a normal difficulty 
LDoN death probably isn't immanent.  But faster than mobs isn't just for 
pulling (heck, my berserker constantly pulls without being at all faster 
than mobs, just the 150 range head start is plenty for almost any 
situation), rather, its for playing "keepaway" from an overpull.  And 
while many classes might still just say to hell with it, they're not 
going to have room to move and stop to cast anyway, a bard never ever 
has to stop moving to cast, not even if he's using clickies.

Run 3 is a bard's best friend though, and by his level I'm reasonably 
sure he has it.

Good point, particularly as a bard, he's probably got HP regen song in 
his memmed mix anyway, which should be more than enough to keep his full 
from incedental damage, which is normally what regen is really for.

Dex affects... well, call it fizzles, cases where the bard's fumbly 
fingers mess up a song.  Also, if the bard is meleeing (and despite 
relatively low damage output, many do, simply because it doesn't slow 
down their singing anyway, so why not?  then it will boost his proc rate 
just like anyone elses.  Course he may already have capped dex at 65 
with no buffs at all.

While Str helps melee damage, bard melee DPS is low enough that cutting 
10% off of it won't matter much to the group, so this is a good idea if 
he's getting desperate for buffs to drop.

Yep, this won't do a damn bit of good, absolute trash for a bard.  Funny 
thing is if it -did- work it would be more godlike for a bard than for 
any other class; they live and die by how many songs they can keep 
running at the same time; casting faster would let them run more!

Aye thats a situational buff, occaisionally its nice but more often than 
not its just a luxury you can ditch if there's something important.  It 
is a nice luxury though not having to refresh SS boots every 10 minutes 
if you're travelling at selos speed thru hilly terrain... at that speed 
a bumpy ride can be deadly.

Because dex can matter, werewolf can be handy.  By his level, he may be 
doing this himself with a lute of the howler.  I can't think of any 
other chanter illusion that would be useful for a bard in general 
situations.

At least a mage DS has a fire resist component to it which might be 
useful to the group in some situations.  Druid DS is nothing but DS?
