Not needed to drive down prices, since you can only display 30 items
to a seller but can add many more to the data base. Fill first 30
slots with whatever crap ya want for outlandish prices then add the
items to be driven down by say 30-50%. Buyer wont buy though 20 items
of over priced crap to get to the goodies and if ya watch it ya can
end trader before they do so anyway. Your under priced stuff shows in
the bazaar data base list though and influences prices for what ever
reason ya want. Works best on Mid-range items. This has been known
since test btw and is ignored by verant.

Point being the bazaar, like the warder, is bugged, this is an
exploit, and I want anyone doing this banned lol...yeah right

Lota stuff going on in that bazaar I tell ya )
