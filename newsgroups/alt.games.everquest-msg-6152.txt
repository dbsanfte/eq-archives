You didn't actually need to put any practice points in Tailoring as you can
start by making silk threads (2 spiderling silks) and/or silk swatches (2 spider
silks). Making from these silk cords (3 silk threads), silk bandages (2 silk
threads) and silk garments (silk swatches and pattern), you can get your skill
level up to 36. As an Iksar Monk I don't know what to do after that as there
aren't any wolf, cat, or bear pelts on Kunark that I know of.

Cheers Watchman. :)
