    Sigh, reading comprehension is not your strong point today, is it? Using
/roleplay to indicate you're a roleplayer isn't wrong. Nowhere did I state
that. What I *DID* say was that on most servers, it's not very effective,
and that those that use it for that purpose are in for a rude shock. Most
people will NOT clue in that you're roleplaying until you start roleplaying
with them.

>Get a clue, asswipe.

    Given that this is the second hate-filled post you've made in this
thread in response to me, can I safely assume that you are an avid user of
the /roleplay tag and my description of "cowering behind it to avoid being
asked for things" offended you? If so, and you use it to indicate you are a
roleplayer, my apologies to you for your misconception of my intent. But I
won't apologize for characterizing folks who hide from tells as fearful.

    Just imagine a server with NO /anon function, where the roleplaying tag
didn't serve to make one anonymous as well. No confusion about what the tag
means. People looking for help in a courteous manner able to find help
faster, and likely in a more convenient place. And morons who can't accept
"no" being put on so many /ignore lists so fast that they can't slip through
the cracks to high levels and become real grief players. Sigh, I wish.

    James
