Is there a way to filter spellcasting spam based on who the caster and/or
target is?  Specifically, if it's a PC vs an NPC? I'd like to be able to
separate the not-so-important "Drizzzt's eyes gleam with virtue" messages
from the more important "A furious blackhand yawns" and VERY important
"A grimling priest begins casting the Gate spell" messages.
