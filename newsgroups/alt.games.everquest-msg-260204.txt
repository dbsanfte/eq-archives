This morning I got three runes of summoning swords and various pieces of
phantom armor all in one drop by a goblin in butcherblock. all items were magic
and no rent.

I could not find anyone who knew what they are used for and Allahkazam did not
have a listing for them. 

Does anyone know what they might have been useful for since they were no rent
they are gone now.
