Oh, I never believe their hype for the sole reason I don't think they
would ever tell you that they are losing people.

You got to figure that the numbers are divided into different groups,
but they don't say that.
How many accounts are new peeps that want to try it out and quit after
a month.
How many are inactive accounts.
How many are people that have more than one account, still that is an
account, but they would be better off saying they have 460,000
"accounts" and not "subscribers" then it would be a more accurate
statement.
