 I'd personally not recommend soloing in PoP. At your level you have two
choices. Plane of Disease and Plane of Nightmare. There's Innovation as
well, but there's not a whole lot of room there.

 Anyway, PoD and PoN is pretty crowded, so best bet is to stay in the
old world zones until getting 60. Join a guild if not in one already,
then get flagged for the other zones.
