Yes, anything but an Iksar is a curious sight around FoB! :-) The experience 
would get a little thin there at 19. I think I soloed at the base of Kurn's 
until 20 or maybe 21. Then headed to OT. Luckily on my server The Overthere 
is 
not at all crowded. I enjoyed my time there - good exp, good loot, and a 
vendor who sells bandages.

What more could a scaley monk want? :-)
