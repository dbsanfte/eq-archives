And indeed other companies do exist that have much of it down, including 
  some opensource stuff.

Possible but I doubt it.

Emulation of the XBOX with VirtualPC would be decidely unsatisfactory 
without a drastic amount of work. Its simply a round peg in a square 
hole. VPC is very good at running old business apps on Windows 95 inside 
a virtual environment on an XP PC... its pretty weak for running even 
old end of dos era games like Privateer 2, or even antiques like Might & 
Magic 3. I'd hate to see it running an xbox title without *major* work. 
-- considering that the VPC graphics card is a 4MB S3... which is a long 
long way from emulating the geforce "2.5" in an xbox.
