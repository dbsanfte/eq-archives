Nothing is stopping you from starting a character there now.

Then you will LOVE playing on FV.

I gave up the following characters on Innorruk to play full time on FV
(I fell in love with the environment and the roleplaying). All of the
characters are well equiped with much more than 100 real life days
spent playing them.
53-Monk
51-Druid
51-Warrior
33-Bard
22-Beastlord
24-Shaman

If your highest character on your current server is level 10, you
won't feel much pain starting fresh on FV. It only takes 5-7 play time
hours to hit level 10 if you play casually.

>Is it possible those nice people at Verant would consider porting them from Seventh Hammer to FV (whatever)

No

You cannot transfer characters between servers with different rule
sets. If you could it would cost you $50.00 for the service, which is
a lot of money for a level 10 character.
