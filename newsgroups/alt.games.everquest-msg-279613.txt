The average raider doesn't need to group outside their guild because the 
average raider is in a guild with a critical mass of available players 
that are on at the same time as they are.

I think the fact that when they group outside their guild they run into 
players who are a) under-geared, and b) incompetent that's just gravy.

The b) is highly variable... many single groupers are better players 
than raiders. (You almost have to be to get anything interesting done in 
the cratacular gear you and your group mates have to work with). But 
there is no shortage of single groupers who are little more than whining 
xp leeches.

Interesting point. And very true.

Its always frustrating to lose to someone who doesn't need it. Its 
doubly so when they don't need anything you'll ever be able to achieve.

Me too. Despite the frustration its fair and not subject to any sort of 
manipulation or abuse.

This is what prompted me to post into this thread again. I 
wholeheartedly agree that stuff like this should be implemented, and 
that more thought needs to be put into the single-group game in general.

In summary: the gear quality is relevant the expansion age isn't.

I made a point of not buying a single item in the bazaar, and for -me- 
they were an obtainable upgrade in my late 20s with a small group. But 
with the new extended newbie armour they are finally completely put out 
to pasture.

(LDoN armour was better than SolRo, but the number of points you got for 
a 25th level run is just spinning your wheels.)

If player ability could be rated on a scale of 1-10. Raiders would be 
all 4-10, while single groupers are distributed from 1-10. I know a lot 
of single groupers who are 10s, and who are better players than most 
raiders... who can take 1-group content with 3 people in craptacular 
gear that many raiders won't attempt without a full group.

But then I know plenty of 1-groupers who can't find their way to FoB 
from PoK without someone literally leading them by the hand... and they 
have craptastic gear to boot. Just a waste of air.

And these aren't just theoreticals. I play enough, I even play in large 
enough blocks... hell I play more than some raiders I'm friends with. I 
just don't play the same days every week; I am unable to -gaurantee- 
that I'll be on for any length of time; and I play off peak so my 
options are limited at the best of times.

Remember the "loot whores" Faned told us about earlier? We *have* to 
pander to them right?!! I mean surely "loot whores" a minority of 
raiders (raiders being a minority of players themselves) should be the 
most important group!

Yep.

One of the flaws of the AA system really. The endgame is so diverse... 
between the gear gap and the AA differentials its impossible to gauge 
someones likely effectiveness. So... what happens is they just cater to 
the lowest common denominator and demand Xk hppoints... forcing a 
certain level of gear, and pretty much ignorning AA... 

Not sure if its because people with that level of gear are gauranteed to 
have the AA, or more likely, people have determined that with that level 
of gear they don't need the AA. If the tank happens to have it, great, 
if not then 'mobs seemed to be hitting a bit harder than usual that 
day'. That seems to indicate that a tank with the aa but not the gear 
could tank adequately... but of course its moot if you can't get past 
the group invite.
