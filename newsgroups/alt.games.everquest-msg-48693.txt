 Uh.. excuse me? Driving a car has never, ever been a "right". Driving
is a _privilege_, definitely NOT a "right". "Rights" are given to us
(at least in the U.S.) in our Constitution. Rights are granted to us
simply by being born here, the privilege to drive is EARNED by learning
and being tested and subsequently QUALIFYING by passing several tests. 
If the privilege is abused by operating a vehicle unlawfully or 
negligently, the privilege can and will be summarily revoked.
 
 It really pisses me off when people start talking about their "right"
to do "whatever". For instance, my neighbors think they have a 
"constitutional right" to blast the entire neighborhood with 
incredibly loud rap "music" in the middle of the night whenever 
they get the urge. They have stated this repeatedly, but they are 
WRONG.
 
 Protestors a few years back screamed that they had a "constitutional 
right" to block my streets, hurl molotov cocktails at Police officers
and break the windows of nearby businesses. They were WRONG.
 
 It never ceases to amaze me what some people believe they have the 
"RIGHT" to do.
