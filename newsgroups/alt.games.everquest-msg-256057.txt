Necros get a pet at first level and mages have to wait til 4th. I like
mages because they can summon a lot of stuff to help their pet and
themselves. I think a mage is a little harder to play than a necro but
a bit more fun. Necro is snare, fear, send in pet and DOT. Lots of
DOTs and refresh fear and snare as needed. I think it can get boring
at times. 

With a mage you get a selection of 4 pets that can change your style
of play. Earth, Fire, Air and Water. Each has their own strengths and
weaknesses.
