    Take the level of your pet. Add two. There's your DS. To find out more
pet info, we visit this thread on Mage's Tower:


http://forum.magecompendium.com/tower/viewtopic.php?t=3191&start=0&postdays=0&postorder=asc&highlight=

    Might have to manually put in the last "=", it's not adding itself as
part of the link for some reason. By reading through that thread, we find
that the level 39 Fire pet is level 33. So, it has a 35 point damage shield.

    My magician is 42. I see a marked difference between when Jobober has
full summoned gear and when he has nothing in terms of his ability to tank.
And I got to see him tank a lot, because of my style - pull with small nuke,
then let pet tank for the 17 seconds it takes my Boots of Bladecalling to
deliver the "BOOM" that turns the mob to run mode.
