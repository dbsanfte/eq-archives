heh .. I've been kicking around the Usenet since the screamin' machine had a
12 Mhz processor, 640K of RAM, and this new-fangled thing called a hard disk
drive (who's ever gonna fill up 20 megabytes of storage?). :-)

Top-posting works great for email exchanges for just the reason you
mentioned ... it's a closed communication between two people, and all you
need to see is the most recent addition.  Usenet posts are more like a
conversation at a party ... if a third party wants to join in, top-posted
replies make it somewhat difficult to follow the thread.  Bottom posting
makes the thread read more like a book.

fwiw ... :-)
