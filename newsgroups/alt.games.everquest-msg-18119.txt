Knew someone would bring that up. Do you think that sat nav exists in
Norrath, so what you are saying is that as it is a game it should have as
little to do with reality. As you walk thru a dungeon you should have all
details drawn out for you, not like you should have to learn it yourself.

Verant purposely did not include any auto mapping facility because they
wanted people to learn zones from experience. There was a program available
that enabled players to see a map of the zone they were in as well as other
things, Verant took a court order forcing it to be removed from the web,
can't see them bringing in the facility themselves after that.
