The latest from SOE about monks (aka planned changes, and areas to revisit)
was that damage (DPS) was to be adjusted (raised)

Now sure, everybody would like to do more damage, but given the choice, FIX
OUR FUCKING MITIGATION.

One would think, with over 1500ac, Combat Stability 3, and Innate Defence 5,
I wouldn't get hit for max damage EVERY fucking swing

The "slight change" to monks mitigation totally destroyed them, I dread to
think what "slight" changes to charm will entail.
