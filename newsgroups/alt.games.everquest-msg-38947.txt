Where does all of this displeasure for Stonebrunt come from (and not you
personally David - I happened to have liked that band you played for)?  Some
40'ish yelling to the zone yesterday not 10 minutes after I saw him come in
and beg a SoW  - "This is the most hastily designed POS zone I've ever
seen".

I just don't get it.  I don't have Kunark or Velious yet and this zone just
flat kicks the shit out of anything I've seen in the old world.  Plus, I
made 28 & 29 there over the weekend without a hitch.

Coming at this as a *new* player, I think this zone is great.  It doesn't
appear AT ALL to be hastily constructed and even if so, wow.  So what if
every green aggro's (which they don't but a the majority do)...I like it
because it keeps me on my tows when hunting.  My strafing gets a good work
out hunting this zone I guarantee you.  If we're comparing Stonebrunt
against oh, say North Karana - boy theres a real comparison.  From 19-27ish
in the Karanas just about drove me from the game...again.  What a yawner
that became.  Flat flat oh and more flat with some bumps here and there.

So what is it?  Just game burnout or what?  I admire what VI added with the
Stonebrunt zone and don't get why others hate it so much.  The loot code
thing?  How do I know about that?  I don't - as a new player if it flew by
in the patch message I must have missed it.

What's Iceclad?
