Let's try a back-of-the-envelope estimate.  Let's allow for 100000
players online at once.  EQ works fine on a 33.6k modem, and doesn't
keep the modem anywhere near saturated most of the time, so lets guess
8k/second is what we need, on average.  They thus need 800k/second
bandwidth.  That's equivalent to about 500 T1s.

So, ballpark estimate would be around $500k-$1M/month for their internet
connection and bandwidth.
