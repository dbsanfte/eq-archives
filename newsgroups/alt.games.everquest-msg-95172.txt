Or perhaps no.  Sounds to me like the mob was following one of those
bullshit pathing setups EQ is so full of.  How can you assert with any
certainty that the mob had not in fact agro'd on somebody in the OP's
group?  Were you there?  did you have the mob targeted while it was
running around?  and did you then /assist to see who it was agro'd on?
This sort of pathing is hardly unique to HK either.  Have you ever
watched the paths followed by the orcs in CB?  or the pathing in the
canyon leading to EK from Beholder?  The only thing clear from the
story, assuming it is accurate, is that the camp jumper was being an
ass.
