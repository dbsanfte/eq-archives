Sorry David, it wouldn't alter my view. I'm not American and can't
understand this need to bear arms. Yeah I know it's to stop the
government ever becoming tyrannical, but according to some recent posts
they have failed. Another point, I certainly wouldn't stick my head
outside if someone was taking potshots at me.
I really don't like the way this always turns back to this one rule, as
if rules on paper are the be all and end all. Where did morals go? What
happened to good old common sense?
Yeah, your laws say you can protect yourself, but building mini armies
all over? Racist chatlines and so forth? Anyway, I have been informed on
a few occasions that I am not really entitled to have a say in matters
such as these. The 'experts' are always right.
I bow down to everyone's view that you have the right to blow the crap
out of each other and just say I'm glad I live here.
