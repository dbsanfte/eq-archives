Another place to use it is when soloing a mob that can charm.  I wa hunting
in EK with my monk a while back and an EE came up and charmed me.  /q and
chances are you'll log out before the charm expires.  Then when you log back
in you are back under control.  Much better then having the EE send you
against a guard.
