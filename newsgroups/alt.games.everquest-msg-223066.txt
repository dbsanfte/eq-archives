That's still incorrect, 49 fire, 52 fire, DDD and 58 fire all
get eaten - or not, it is pretty random.  The theory that the mage's
resists need to be extremely low to force the pet to use his old 
innate immunity doesn't work reliably either.


On the other hand - Get a 65 melee to tank, get his FR above 200
and it's not too hard to keep up with the dot and melee output, even
for a 65 ranger.
