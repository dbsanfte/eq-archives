It doesn't stand to reason.  It is common sense to think so.  But the truth is
that some people make better flaggers than others, and the people most in need
of flagging are the ones least able to help flag others.  By the time you do
flag someone and he levels up to where he can help flag others, you are already
far more experienced at flagging than he would be.

Turns out flagging people doesn't relieve nearly as much of the burden as you
might expect, in some ways, by making you more expert, it actually makes you
-more- desirable as a flagger than before you helped those people in!

Common sense and reason occaisionally lead to different conclusions.
