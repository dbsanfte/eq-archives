Georg, thanks, it does. I'm not a computer geek, though I've had one ever
since the Vic 20 (anyone remember THAT little beast?) came out, about oh...
17 years ago? The things that they do are not intuitive to me, and I tend to
get frustrated and irritated rather easily, even after all this time. I know
I probably only need a few classes in 'puters, to take the edge off... just
can't seem to get around to it. I appreciate your informative post, and I
will look into the supplemental manual (Oh, if all else fails, RTFM?? ;) )

thanks,
Darklet
