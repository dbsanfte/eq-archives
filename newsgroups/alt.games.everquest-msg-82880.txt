A couple of weeks ago, my guild did a Fear raid.

This was just after they made some changes to the zone, and we got ganked. 
Hard.

After awhile, I realized that there wasn't much I could do, so I took a note
of how much time was left on my corpse and camped.  I'd drop in from time to
time to see how the CR was going, deduct that time, and camp again.

By the time the zone got broken, I had about 10 minutes left on the corpse,
and was able to get a rez.  But this is the interesting part.  My wife, who
had died after me, camped earlier, and never logged back in to check, was
not able to get rezzed - her corpse was too old.  It should have had much
more time left on it than mine.

I chalked it up as "one of those things", knowing there wasn't really
anything that could be done.

A couple of friends had the same problem.  One was able to get a rez, the
other's corpse was too old.  Upon talking, we discovered an interesting
pattern. Those of us that didn't /camp desktop were able to get rezzed. 
Those who did were not - their corpses were too old.

It's hard to tell with only 4 cases, but there may be a bug with /camp
desktop in that the corpse timer is still running after you use it.

Has anyone else seen this?
