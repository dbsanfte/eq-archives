I recommend 10pp. If you can't afford that, state what you're offering
up front. It's best to offer more for the higher level zones, but for
places like BB, Tox, NK and WC, 10 is fine.

I always cast SoW when someone asks. Porting is another story. For me,
porting involves:

- waiting for the portee to come to me (in most cases)
- casting Sow
- healing the portee if they need it
- casting invis and/or levitate
- porting to the destination
- waiting 0-50 seconds for the portee to zone (I zone in 10 seconds)
- porting back to my location
- medding up to recover the 490+ mana I just used
