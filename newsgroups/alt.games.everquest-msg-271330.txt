I was just wondering how much more I have left to see in EQ2. I'm a lvl 18 
predator and so far i've only really seen Antonica. I know my way around 
there pretty well but I havent done hardly any of the higher level quests on 
the map yet.

Apart from Antonica what other areas are there?

I know there is stormhold and some sort of ice type land, are there any 
more? I realise that I havent even see freeport and the command lands but I 
was just curious to know exactly how big the area is.

Are there some playing areas where even the highest level characters havent 
reached yet?

I presume SOE will release expansion packs for EQ2, does anyone know what 
form these take? I never played EQ1 but I read that had a lot of expansion 
packs released for it. Did these add new areas to visit, or even change the 
overall gameplay in any way?

Also does anyone know if you can get into Queynos main city or is this going 
to be in a future expansion.

Basically i'm interested in how MMORPG games (EQ2) progress, having never 
played one before.
