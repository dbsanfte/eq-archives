uhggg... here we go again ;o)

can't be bothered typing it all out again, so follow THIS link...

btw... I'm Iilolian... and I finally hit SCHOLAR on Allakhazams!!!! *woot*

There's no cap on skill-assisting stats... and foraging is one of those
'highest of Int or Wis' skill... so your 204 Wis is fine. Even adding Wis is
viable (especially with the new formula for mana with a stat over 200).

The reason you're dragging behind your level with this skill is because
you're hitting the nasty levels where it's just plain HARDER to increase a
skill (foraging is capped at 200 anyway, and you're at the level where you
can hit that).

Melee skills are always going to be tough for a druid (low strength and lack
of practice opportunities), casting skills are hitting their upper limits,
so THEY slow down (regardless of Wis).

Don't worry about it, is my advice. :o)
