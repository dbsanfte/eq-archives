Hehe. I *was* there.

It was more like:

Sheava tells housecleric:1, "CHeal roto is Sheava, Tagichii, Marcve,
Monuel, Dalk. Pause 35."

Sheava tells housecleric:1, "Rotational CHeal inc on {{ Wanda }} -1-"
Sheava tells housecleric:1, "Tagichii, go now."
Marcve tells housecleric:1, "Complete heal on {{ Wanda (p 35) }} -2-"
Sheava tells housecleric:1, "Tag not casting. MARCVE CHeal."
There is one player in EverQuest:
=================================
[1 Beastlord] Tagichii (Vah Shir) <House Archon> ZONE:bazaar
Sheava tells housecleric:1, "Shit. Tagichi's not here. Tagichii, his
bazaar mule is in channel."
Marcve tells housecleric:1, "M O N O U E L, you're next."
prexus.Monuel tells serverwide.age:4, "Guys, I'm not even on the right
SERVER."
Arxael tells the raid, "Wanda down. Gangleri next tank."

OK. I didn't actually include Monuel in the roto, but I felt dumb
enough that I could have. I got about a half-dozen people killed on
that particular flub before we got the roto running right.
