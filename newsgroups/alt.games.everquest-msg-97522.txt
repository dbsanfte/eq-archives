And this (since, with one exception, the rest of your entire post is
just a parrot repeating this same theme) is where the debate apparently
ends. There are some who think that the changes make it easier in a good
way. Others feel that the degree of change makes it "too easy". You seem
to be the only one who doesn't feel they are stating an opinion. You are
espousing, as fact, that you have somehow calculated exactly how much
"easier" it will be, compared that to some defined line on the "easiness
scale" and found it not crossing that line. We now only await your cites
to the appropriate Bureau of Weights and Measures websites to show how
you determined this to be fact and not your opinion, and we're all done.

See above.

Yes. Since you missed the point here yet again, go read the other
threads on this topic and try to keep to the same point. Lots of
casters, here and elsewhere, *DO* feel that the spellbook is a huge
hindrance in group situations. (Not the "go someplace safe to med when
you solo" scenario that you keep harping on.)

Only left that one in to show you where you missed the beam entirely,
yet again, on what was being said. There is no huge majority of people
who "like" the spell book, or perhaps even want it in the game. They
specifically *don't* want it because it makes the game <HARDER> when not
soloing. What part of this are you simply not able to grasp?

Obviously you didn't need any evidence of anything. A closed mind rarely
does, having come to their own conclusions  before "debating" them with
others.

In this case, I personally feel you are wrong. But that's just my
opinion. I'm not privy to your method of "ease measurement" to determine
these "facts" you have.
