these rules come from the old testament, they were impossible to follow, and
sacrifices were often made.  these were temporary laws to be followed until
the coming of Christ.  after He came and died he became the last sacrifice
so that we no longer must suffer these things or be bound by the rules of
the old testament because the debt had been paid. now instead of the
punishments listed in the old testament, all we have to do is repent ( turn
from evil ways ) and ask forgiveness, and we can be assured eternal
salvation, our debts have already been paid.
