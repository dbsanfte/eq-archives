Agreed.  Although I would prefer to have seen several distinct
bazaars, one per continent perhaps.

I have to disagree here.  I'll not argue that your global consignment
shop would place all the players on an equal footing, regardless of
their ability to stay online for extended periods of time.  I do not,
however, agree that that would be a good thing.  What I see as the
primary effect of your idea would be that EQ would slide even closer
to the single-player games where your character's entire carrer
revolves around the shopkeeper.  It would remove some of the game's
flavor/atmosphere and lead inevitably to even more "cookie cutter"
characters than you see now with even less interest in doing anything
other than farming platinum.  And I see an awful lot of that as it
is.  Hell, I never liked the global bank setup, always seemed to me
that it ought to cost you something to change your banker.

I will now toss out the obligatory analogy for debunking:
Equality is analogous to entropy, what you are proposing would take
EQ a good bit further down the road to "heat death".  What EQ needs
is equity (i.e. different ways to achieve similar results), preserving
inequality without being patently unfair.  If every player (and every
class!) are "equal" we might as well just sit around, throw dice,
declare the high roller the winner, and go find something that's
actually interesting to do.
