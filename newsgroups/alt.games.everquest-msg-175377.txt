I'm looking for somewhere that gives decent xp and loot in PoP.  I got a
group in PoN the other day killing trees and birds, great xp but no
loot.  I'm dead broke, and trying to come up with more cash to finish my
Trophy. I've tried the cash crop spots (RM, EF) but they are always
camped up the wazoo.  I even tried soloing at the entrance of sebilis
while waiting for a group, but that was extremely deadly.

Basicly I'm looking for somewhere I can go charm solo with boltrans in
PoP get decent xp and some loot more than the 5 pp I get average in the
grey.  I don't mind getting in a group, but I want somewhere I can solo
in the mean time if I end up waiting an hour or two since I often don't
have much time.  I'm willing to sell drops in the bazaar as well.  I'm
totally unfamilar with PoP, but I consider myself a top notch charm
soloist.  I'm willing to try areas outside of PoP too, it's just the XP
was so good there.
