In other words, just like EQ except it doesn't have the "then you kill
the mob 50 times over the next two weeks waiting for the quest item to
drop".

If you are using those "not worth the effort" quest rewards, you won't
be taken down in 2-3 shots by archers.

I've noticed that EQ players who try DAoC fall into three groups.

1. There are some that are going slowly, playing around with different
classes, trying to figure out how things work, doing all the quests,
etc.  These people are generally having a lot of fun.

2. There are some that leveled up fast, and have misunderstood many
aspects of the game.  For any given thing, they tend to either try to
play it like EQ when it isn't, or they misunderstand the significance
of a difference from EQ.  Example: DAoC is not the equipment-fest that
EQ has become.  Store bought stuff is good enough for most things, and
player-made stuff is excellent.  However, this does not mean you
should ignore dropped stuff.  Dropped stuff is a little bit better.
If you were outfitted entirely in dropped stuff, carefully chosen for
the bonuses that help your class, you'll be significantly better.  If
you obsess about camping for dropped stuff, you'll be unhappy.
However, if you go the other way, and misunderstand the significance
of the player-made stuff and just settle for that all the time, you'll
probably also be unhappy, as you are weaker in RvR than you could be.

3. There are some that leveled up fast to get to RvR, and are applying
general principles they learned from EQ, but are not letting the
details prejudice them...they learn how things work in DAoC, rather
than trying to shoehorn them into working the way they do in EQ.
These people are generally having a lot of fun.

OK, there is a fourth group I've seen, too: total idiots.  I've seen
groups where the players claim to all have level 50+ EQ characters,
yet it has not occure to them that hitting a mezzed mob in DAoC might
be a bad thing.  Doing it once or twice, to figure out if mez in DAoC
works the same as in EQ is fine....but I've seen people who do it
every fight.  Hell, I've seen people who claim to play 50+ EQ
*Enchanters* do this.
