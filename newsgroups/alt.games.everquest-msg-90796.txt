    What necros? They all started rogue/monk/warrior/cleric alts.

    You read the warrior sites - you might be able to answer this. The
mitigation and avoidance alt XP abilities - have they turned out to be
multiplicative, or do they just add? As in, max one - x% less damage, max
two - 2x% less damage or (2x - 1)% less damage? And yeah, the warrior
abilities look nice - I can see 36 points of Archetype skills that all
warriors should have, bar none.

    The need for warriors, the easy-to-get twink gear, and the 90% XP bonus
help a lot in that regard.

    He does have a small point here. For most people, travelling is what you
do when you don't have a group. And warriors are about as vulnerable as a
class gets for most of their early career when travelling. They have a lot
of planning (binding, getting SoW, stocking Invis potions) to do that other
classes don't have because if a mob finds them (and they can't avoid mobs
except by running around them) they have to fight to the death or run. But
that's one of the few weak points for the class.
