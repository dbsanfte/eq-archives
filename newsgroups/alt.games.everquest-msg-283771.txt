After playing EQ for about 6 years and WoW pretty much since
inception, I honestly don't think there's any difference in the
population in terms of maturity / kiddies.  There were plenty of jerks
/ idiots / children in EQ.  At least WoW has introduced mechanics to
minimize the effects of griefers on the game.

As far as content / backstory / lore, EQ clearly has way more content,
but for a new player that's not going to matter much.  I find the
backstory in WoW much more consistent and interesting than the EQ
story (whatever the EQ story is... hard to tell), but that's probably
because I played Warcraft 2 and 3.  Warcraft 3 in particular had a
strong story line.  One of the things I've enjoyed the most in WoW is
running into a "known character" like Jaina Proudmore or finding Uther
Lightbringer's tomb.
