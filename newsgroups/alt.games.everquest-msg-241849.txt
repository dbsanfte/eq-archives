Me thinks that the advent of huge armies of evil critters arising at 
night in certain zones may have to do with the story line advancing. If 
you're following the storyline of the game, the good guys are not 
exactly winning this war against the evil and undead. In fact, the fight 
is getting tougher and more deadly for everyone.
