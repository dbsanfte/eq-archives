However, the next DAoC expansion is in beta now, and expected for release in
December.  That adds the main thing that seems to differentiate the latest
generation from the previous generation (instancing), and also updates the
graphics engine.  EQ2 and WoW will have more extensive tradeskills, but for
those not heavily into tradeskills, I don't see the generation difference
between DAoC and WoW as really being significant (and it remains to be seen
whether or not EQ2 tradeskills will be useful...many a tradeskill system has
been rendered irrelevant by an economy gone bad).

Hell, SWG was a generation or two ahead of EQ1, and it sure didn't make a
good impression on most of the EQ1 players I know!
