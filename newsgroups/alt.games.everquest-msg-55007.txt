Umm.... you are sure you're level 51?

I am 39, and recently I could kill THREE shamans
(around where the Nokta Shaman spawns, not too far from
AC camp).

With a level 42 or so Wizzie friend, we had a train of 3 warriors
and a shaman and we got them down pretty fast once he had brought
them to AC camp, where I was waiting....

Oh, btw: I am a necro.
What class are you playing?
