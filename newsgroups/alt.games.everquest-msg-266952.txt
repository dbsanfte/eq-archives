Play EQ 2 for a few days and you'll never go back and you'll never
worry about these issues again unless your computer can't support
gameplay. I have to say that the specs are reasonable. I'm running it
on a 3 year old business pc with a 1.6 ghx P4 a direct x 9 video card
and 512mb of RAM. In fact it runs better on this pc than EQ1. Go
figure.
