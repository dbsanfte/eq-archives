The big number 1 guild who does it any way they like, and then lays down the
conditions on how others can attempt it...

From my experiances with rotations, and what I've read about others with
them, I think they are a load of BS that a) restrict others, b) were setup
with ulterior motives

I personally wouldnt..

If there was a mob my guild couldnt kill, and I had the chance to use my
guild and another_guild to throw incredible numbers at a mob, theres no way
in hell I will be a part of the zergfest

But I know my guild won't ever result to that, won't ever have to.. every
mob we've come against in the past, whatever fortified the brick wall
blocking our path that we banged our heads against, we never gave up..
sooner or later we were back with a vengeance to kick its ass

From the days of vindi that took multiple attempts, early on days of CT that
took hours, Tormax and Statue to our first killing of aary that took
something ridiculous like 7 hours to drop.. as it got later we lost more and
more people, but there was enough motivation that by the end of the night he
was dead

It wasn't all a struggle, Tunare died first attempt, Emp of Ssra died first
ever try, cursed on first try (second try on the event).. we still have the
strats on our boards for dealing with Innie.. Doze, Zland and Kland

Im a firm believer that tactics and skill > numbers, and whilst I personally
won't take part in silly zerg raids, I won't belittle or snub people who got
into zones via that method (assuming said person is able to be/hunt/raid in
that zone without fucking over everybody else)

Id much prefer to spend 10 hours wiping and then win, then to just get 200
people, and steamroll the fuck outof a mob.. I need to take pride in my
achievements, or, well they arent achievements

Id imagine.. "we can kill that mob.. by letting you take a shot we are not
getting loot we would otherwise be guaranteed to get.. so if u want a shot..
give us the loot"

Id never try it.. Id never agree to it...

Guildxx offered us All of Ssra, on condition we didn't kill Emp.   Offered
us all of Luclin on condition we didnt kill emp...  Offered us all of Luclin
and Emp rifts on condition we didn't kill emp..  Warned us we would fuel
much anger in our direction if we killed Emp

a) if we get into VT its because we earned our place there by killing Emp
b) fuck your threats
c) end result, 35ish straight dead emps, every (*every) single death at our
hands
