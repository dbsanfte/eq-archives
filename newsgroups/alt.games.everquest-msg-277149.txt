I don't know how the betrayal quest would alter your journal - if at all. I 
assume that it would not change it. As a Good Character I have done a couple 
of Freeport Quests for Access so I know that from the game point of view 
your alignment does not effect city quests - if you can get them and avoid 
the guards.
