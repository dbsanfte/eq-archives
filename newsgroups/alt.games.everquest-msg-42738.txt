Primarily because outside a very small group, it can't work. People
are simply too willing to advance their own ends. Human beings want
their life to be better. Socialism provides for survival pretty well,
but has no incentive for improvement. Biggest bang for your buck is
what the average will fall to, and that means do only as much as
required to meet your quota.
