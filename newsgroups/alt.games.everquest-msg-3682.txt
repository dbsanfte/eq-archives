I erased a level 3 and got her restarted right away.

I have only ever seen one case of an existing name being erased and
then not accepted, it was a friend with some variation of 'ownzyoo' or
'nosowforjoo' or some other crap nane on a completely unplayed
character.

I once got a bard named 'Metallah' through the filter. It was
surprising in retrospect when I found out about Vhalen Nostrolo :)
