Yes.  The only exceptions I know of are two Paladin only twohanders,
Fiery Avenger (_the_ original epic weapon) and Fiery Defender (the
new Paladin epic) which allow Bash when equipped, and the class-specific
(i.e. L59+) AA ability available to Paladins that allows them to Bash
with any 2HS weapon (do SKs get this too?).
