Not sure how the system works with augments, I know one isn't cancelled out
completely. Both procs will still work, and a weapon with 2 procs, WILL proc
more often a weapon with only one proc.

Now JMC is referring to what I had referenced here earlier, for instance,
taking the primal weapon again as an example: if you have a primal proc on
the weapon and a paladin stun or damage proc on the weapon as well...it will
check the buff proc first (the one you buffed the weapon with), in this
case, the stun/damage proc, next it checks the weapon proc (the proc the
weapon originally had before you modified it), in this case avatar. He is
correct in the fact that if your stun/damage proc procs on one attack, your
avatar cannot proc until the next attack.

I don't think the delay between procs is based on something like a reuse
timer. Simply, you cannot proc 2 procs, on the same attack. Nothing says you
can't do 2 or 3 attacks in a row, that all proc different procs though. If
people have misses filtered, procs can filter on misses too, and it might
appear that 2 procs were on the same attack, as some have claimed, later,
checking log files, or careful examining proved otherwise.

Hope that clears up any confusion, and doesn't add to it instead.
