<snip dstep's incredibly helpful essay :) >

I told my parents ahead of time that the cards gonna cost 350-400 bucks, and
they know that I'm not after some cheap card :).  Luckily, my father knows
about computers and my mother.. well, she follows directions well enough,
hehe.  And it's nice to know about the Linux, because I use mandrake one of
my computers, so now I know I can throw one of my old NVIDIA cards in it.
I've put on 'the list':

*Graphics Card (ATI Radeon 9700 Pro or IOU on new NVIDIA card to be released
in February (latter preferred))

So we'll see what turns up.  Also asked for a pool table (I'm an expensive
person to shop for), a copy of PoP for both of my accounts (my parents will
get me one and my brother will get me the other, I just know it).  Uh oh, my
father just saw my Christmas list.. time to go placate the beast.
