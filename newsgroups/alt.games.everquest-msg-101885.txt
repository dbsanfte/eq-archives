Out of curiousity, how did he con faction wise? I'm wondering if he's
dubious to indifferent, more than likely a quest mob, but if he's KOS to
everyone, could just be a placeholder for a new mob to fight. Some of
these new planes for PoP seem to be heavily fire based from the pictures
and promotional work. You've got me wondering if the entry to one of the
new high level planes won't be found at the bottom of that lava pool,
and you'll need to kill or get around the wurm to get in?

I love a good mystery.
