Had a thought that I'd like to inquire about.

For sake of argument, let's say that I am getting ready to evac the group 
I'm with (lvl 29 wizard).  I click the spell gem (or hit the hotbutton), 
and just as the spell begins casting, kick the UPS and knock the cord to 
my dsl modem out of the outlet enough to lose power.  I go LD.  (This 
particular scenario is unlikely, as I can't get my feet to where the 
stuff is plugged in, but something else could happen.)  

Here comes the questioning:  First, does the spell still go 
off...providing it wasn't gonna fizzle?  And, if it goes off, but the 
sever sees me as LD (but hasn't dropped me yet), do I go with the group 
(discounting the prossiblity that I'm the "left behind"), or get left in 
the area?

It hasn't happened yet, and I don't anticipate it happening, but I had 
the thought and it made me curious.
