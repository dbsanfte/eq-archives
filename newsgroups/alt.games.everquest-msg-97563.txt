/agree Jim

Reading Jim's well thought out response to this thread I tried
to think of how these changes will affect *MY* future playing
and enjoyment of the game.

What dawned on me was that maybe these changes are not really
for the 'newbie' entering the game but for 'us' the veteran EQ players
that are feeling a little burned out and sick of the game.

For me personally I have wanted to play another caster class but
just could not bring myself to continue to play past the early melee
levels (where staring at the spell book was minimal.) I have a retired
enchanter, cleric and shaman that languish in spellbook hell right
now, unplayed. However, after this change goes into effect I am
truly thinking of blowing the dust off of them and getting into another
caster.

For me the low and mid levels are where the fun is in EQ,
the high level game is just so tedious and many times frustrating.

Maybe these changes are to keep 'us' addicted and playing by making
all those 'annoyances' like the spellbook and hell levels go away.
And you gotta wonder that the 1-10 no corpse thing will make twinking
more attractive.

We are worried about making things 'too easy' for the newbie maybe
we should be worried that they are making things too easy for us?
