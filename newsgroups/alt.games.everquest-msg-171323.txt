	AFAIK, the designers have basically written off the whole thing.  The
current guys seem to feel that deity-restricted equipment was a mistake (which
it was) which introduced a lot of imbalances (it did) and really don't feel
like trying to go back and fix it.  For those of us whose race/class/deity
combo got hosed, sucks to be us.

	Deity-restricted equipment came into the game rather late.  Your guide was
probably written when it really didn't matter which deity you worshipped.

|What is the point?

	There isn't one.  It's another cock-up.  The guys who put HotT and BFT
into the game didn't care -- or perhaps didn't even KNOW -- that Rangers don't
all follow Tunare, and didn't bother to balance the equipment choices for
Karana Rangers.
