Heh.  Yeah, that might be advise I would probably crop.  The problem
comes with knowing what to toss and what to keep, though.  And alot of
the guides lean very heavily on advise like "cast Blood Boil to pull,
the sic pet and snare... (making up the spell names here, of course). 
Pretty good advice if you happen to be a necro, of course, but maybe
off-putting to everyone else.
  Oh, as far as the bandwidth thing goes, well, I do pay for mine.  I'm
on cox digital, and I get a total of 6 email addresses with 10
something-bytes each (giga?).  I have digital tv and telephone from cox
also, so it is hard to know exactly what I pay for the internet, but I
do cut them a check for over a hundred dollars a month.
 Pretty sure they don't charge me for the traffic I get, but I suppose
it wouldn't hurt to ask.
