Language mutates.  In specialized circumstances, words take on new meanings.

While in overall gaming terms, you are correct, in EQ1 the term has 
mutated a little.  Few run "real" bots, as you say.

However, the word "bot" is commonly used in EQ1 to refer to something 
slightly different; a secondary character which is used to perform only 
limited tasks, rarely grouped with the main character at all.

If, for example, someone is Dual Boxing a warrior and a rogue, but the 
rogue isn't in the group with the warrior, rather just following along 
and picking the lock to get into a section, or dragging dead bodies out 
as needed, then its common to call that rogue a "bot".

If the warrior and rogue are grouped together, with the warrior tanking, 
and the rogue doing the majority of the damage, then neither is a "bot", 
they are "dual boxed".

With your warrior/cleric example, again, if the cleric is healing and 
buffing and lull pulling and so on, he's dual boxing.  But if he isn't 
grouped with the warrior, and is just dragged along to cast buffs and 
the occaisional rez, he's often referred to as a Bot.

When one person does this, you can call him wrong.  But when the new 
usage is taken up by thousands of people, and when it clearly refers to 
something distinct from what other terms are referring to, then the word 
has taken on a new connotation.  For examples of this, consider Cool, 
Hot, Bad, Gay, Tubular, Fat (aka Phat), etc. etc.
