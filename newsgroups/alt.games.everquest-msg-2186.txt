After having played a druid to 51, my dear little wolf has become a utility
rather than a real "playing" character.  If I need to farm something or some
plat, the druid comes out.  If the guild needs some transport or some PLing, the
druid comes out.  If I want to play for some fun and enjoyment and, yes, group
fun, out come the melees.  My warrior and ranger are great, but by lvl 20 I'd
spent up to 5kpp on each of them.  Once they hit the 30s, their gear was falling
behind the twinking curve (I define this as the level of gear being surpassed by
the level of the character, bass ackwards, I know, but thats how twinking
works).  Therefore I'm in a constant quest to update that gear.  Ahhh, but my
monk!  All those skills to learn and perfect!  Gear was no longer an issue!
1.5kpp mostly in the Fighting Baton and Essence of Dol and the gear was good
into the 40s.  Yes, folks, whatever arguments over who's got the power or too
much, try and remember that we're mostly here for fun, and melee characters are
fun!  Yes, they seem to die more often (fewer escape options) except that wiley
monk!  I had a 15 level streak of NOT dying!  I'm gonna have to see a shrink
about my survivor guilt!

Druids are great on a personal level, for the freedom they afford you to explore
and solo as you please as well as filling the gaps in a group's capabilities.
My own druid's abilities allowed me to start and play the truly fun (IMHO) melee
characters with little stress over gear or where to hunt and how to get there.
I'd already made all the mistakes and found all the routes with my druid.  They
are a great starting character, then, if you're not yet bored with the game,
it's time try something less easy and more fun.
