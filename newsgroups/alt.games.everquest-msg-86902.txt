Hehe, had tailoring at 120, smithing at 176, brewing at 175, pottery at 
136 before i even heard of the quest.

Im doing tailoring for fun and profit, and plan to reach 250 eventually.

And i saw that 5% success chance post too on EQtraders. It just forget a 
few things:
For 5th shawl, you need 75 silks, and 5 biles. Think the figure the guy 
mentioned was 15000 silks. If it was just silks, it would be worth 
trying, silks easy to get if you buff and heal without getting XP at 
Frenzy camp, but the biles are SO much a pain in the ass that its faster 
to get tailoring to the required 115 skill than to farm the biles 
several times.

For the 6th you need Siren hairs. Theyre rare as hell, and can be quite 
dangerous to get. Took me and 2 wizzy friends 3 hours to get 3 (made on 
first try, destroyed 1 hair). Again its a LOT faster to farm the hell 
out of Guk for silks to get to 158 tailoring, than to farm siren hairs 
for 20 tries.
And for this you need over 194 tailoring, so most people wont get that 
high before trying.


And for the 7th shawl you need tailoring too, need 162 skill. If you 
fail on that one, youll loose ALL of the stuff you made for the 7th 
(apart from the Burin, you stil have that one), so youll have to go get 
Royal Kromrif Blood, and Runed Seashell again. Again it will be a LOT 
faster to farm Guk untill 158 skill.
