Well, to be honest I am on a lot of mailing lists and know a fair number 
of people who get their mail through net nannyware, and I really don't 
want my postings to go astray to them, so it is a habit I have 
cultivated. I figure that most people on any group or list i am on has 
the intelligence to fill in the blanks, and don't really feel the need 
to change to filling in the blanks.

It is just like I *know* how to swear like a sailor, I'm an army brat, 
and was a navy spouse for the best part of 20 years, as well as having 
been an inside/outside machinist working in a pretty male dominated 
field. I don't however feel the need to speak like that where I might be 
overheard by my assorted nieces, nephews and god-daughters. Not to say I 
have't cut loose with some serious swearing like the time I dropped a 
microwave oven on my foot, but I try not to swear.
