In my book, joining on principle would indicate that what was proposed 
was consistent with your own principles. Joining in that blacklisting was 
clearly not, therefore you could say they chose *not* to join on 
principles. If they believed in the cause, then they would have joined. 
Either way, you can't fault them for acting on principle.
