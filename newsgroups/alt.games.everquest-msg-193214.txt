You really think he's trolling?  Seems to me that he's just one of
those over-sensitive types who just can't stop themselves from
reacting thoughtlessly to any real or imagined slight.  Some of 'em
react with an "oh poor me" sort of whine, others, like Tom here,
have a favorite insult they fling repeatedly.  Frankly, I don't see
that he's shown enough creativity to meet even the low standards of
those who troll this group.  He does show promise as a source of
entertainment tho, anyone who can assert that Druids and Enchanters
in EQ get "the short end of the stick" has real potential, imo.
Especially now, with hughes no longer insisting several times a week
that Druids are poor soloers, we're in need of nonsense to lighten
the mood.
