Hard as it may be to believe, I might actually be able to add to Biz's
incredibly helpful reply. <g>

Yes, if you have the money and go to a common auction zone (Gfay is a
popular one near where you are now) and use the auction command, you
could ask for a tailor to make and sell you some. Example:
/auction WTB raw silk armor. Please send tells.
(WTB= "want to buy")

Or, you can take up tailoring and make it yourself more cheaply. First
go to http://www.lokari.net/ and find and print out the EQ tailoring
guide. It will tell you all you need to know for this and more.

Basically, it will involve you buying a sewing kit, first. (If you can't
find one, I'm not sure which merchants sell them in Dorfland. Do a
polite /ooc Can anyone tell me where to buy a sewing kit?   and you'll
likely find out.) Then collect silk. Kill spiders and save the spider
silk. Be aware that spiderlings drop "spiderling silk" which is
different than "spider silk" and is used for other things. Combine two
spider silks in the sewing kit to make silk swatches and save them up.
They stack. Using the information you downloaded, you'll be using the
silk swatches and patterns to make your own raw silk armor. Plus,
combining the spider silks to make swatches will get your tailoring
skill up to 15, well on your way to a high enough skill to make the
armor, so that will help, and making swatches never fails.

Good luck!
