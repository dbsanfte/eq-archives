My MMORPG experience is a bit more limitted than yours but I too have
noticed the same thing about EQ2, and I have friends who have noticed
the same thing, though since joining a guild, they've told me its
gotten better (I've since quit the game and went back to CoH -- in a
whole month, his guild leader never could seem to find the time to
actually invite me).

I am fairly certain pf at ;east 2 caises of some of EQ2s problems:

1. The quest system encourages the disitnegration of groups, and the
game system prevents groups from continuing when they lack ceratain
classes.  Becaise qiests aren't shared, what happens is that people
drop in and out of groups at will,  Again, I don't mean everyone (I've
had a few decent quest groups, and 1 or 2 that I'd consider great).
You anounce that you need a healer or a tank for an AQ group, and if
you are persistant enough, you'll find one.  Most of the time peopel
were asking me what mobs we were killing, and I'd say 'whatever peopel
need.'.  Then they'd ask 'what are you killing first'.  I coudlnt'
figure out why they were being so picky, since groups seemed to be so
hard to come by.  Then I had a sunday where I spent 4 hours with the
same group (half of it was spent replacing lost members) killing these
dumb lions in TS (which I didnt'r need, but someone else did) never
once getting a single mob that I needed.  The promise was always that
we'd move on to other mobs when everyone had the lions we needed.  But
we lost the people when they got all the loins they needed, and the
new peopel replacing them would need lions also.  So we never left
that one spot. 

And that was a GOOD group.  Most of my groups would spend more time
replacing members than actually killing.  It would be replace your
healer, kill 3 mobs, replace your tank, kill 3 more mobs, replace your
other healer, replace your damage dealers who quit out of boredom,
then the tank who dropped from frustration, then the caster who
dropped for dinner, and so on.  I can remember spending 3 hours in
Crypt of Betrayal, nearly all of  it either LFG or in a group looking
for new members.

2. Most people in EQ2 are NOT first time MMORPGers.  That alone is not
a bad thing.  Nor is it necessarily a bad thing that some of them come
from these uber EQ1 guilds (but they will NEVER let you forget that
they walk on water, because they played EQ1 since Beta and they have
the number one Paladin on 10 different servers).  The problem is that
a large perscentage of them are these elitist, self-absorbed snobs
that have so little tolerance for the rest of us dregs, that you'd
think you were some orphans from Oliver Twist begging for more gruel
if we dare to ask an honest question. They are so damn intollerant of
anyone else who may be a more casual player or that maybe wants to
show courtesy to others, or may want to make an attempt at casual
conversation that half the time I feel like I'm an NPC in the game.

Anyway, my friends are really disappointed that I went back to CoH.
But on my frist day back, I realized I made the right decision.  I am
constantly getting team invites there,even when I play at odd hours.,
And groups do not often disintigrate in the middle of missions.  It
aint the perfect game, but I'm actually having fun again.
