Yup. Foraged pods of water and flasks of water are both "drinks", so
presumably have the same lifespan. The main advantage is that you can
accumilate water faster than you can drink it; allowing you to create
"flasks" of water gives you something to do with the excess. (At least,
this is the case for both my druid and my ranger, as I have them set to
"auto-forage" on a move forward.) The trivial (from memory) is about 20
brewing skill. And since a flask of water is a flask of water, you can
use the result not only for brewing but for any other trade skills as
well.

One nice little side benefit: You could combine 4 foraged water with a
6cp bottle to make a flask of water. Combine 1 flask of water and 2
foraged fruit or berries to make *5* flasks of fruit juice (trivial at
21) or berry juice (trival at 24). I haven't checked, but if the juices
are drinks rather than whistle wetters, you can get 5 full drinks for the
cost of a single bottle.
