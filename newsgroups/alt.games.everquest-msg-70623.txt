  Being an erudite shadow knight, I had no choice.  I had to stay
orderly evil.

  But I would definitely stick with neutrality, or convert to
neutrality if you have that option.  The simple fact is that it's
pretty hard to find groups on Firiona Vie as it is sometimes, and
having a restrictive alignment only compounds those difficulties.  The
miniscule gameplay advantage to having a minor experience bonus in
some instances is not worth closing up your options.  If you're a
"hardcore roleplayer" and want to play a good or evil character, you
can still, via roleplay, refuse to join someone of an opposing
alignment, but instead of having the brainless "system" choose for
you, you can make your own decisions about who your character would
and wouldn't group with.
