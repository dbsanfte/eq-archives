You obviously aren't an animal person at all.  Snip, snip.

You're an ignoramus.  Beyond the fact that a wild cat isn't the worst thing
in the world, the ugly fact about adoption is that there are many families
waiting to adopt an unwanted, white, under-3, healthy, intelligent child.

Wanna guess how many white, under-3, healthy, intelligent children are
unwanted?

Whereas animals deal with things differently and, not surprisingly, have
much fewer problems.  Though from a human perspective some of the ways they
deal with things can seem cruel.  Why, just in this thread we have heard
about a person trying to save runts that the mother rejected.

I'm well aware of the differences.  You don't seem to have a very firm grasp
of the actual differences, mostly displayed in your lack of knowledge about
people, of all things.  Seriously, would any sane person try to use adoption
as an arguing point in this discussion if they knew the facts about
adoption?
