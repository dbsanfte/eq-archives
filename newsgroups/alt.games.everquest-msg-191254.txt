If your a low life ninja looting scum bag, then I have some good news for
you!

From the most recent dealings with a GM (yes GM, not volunteer guide), it
seems unless you can *PROVE* you killed said mob, they won't do jack shit to
return the loot, or punish the offender.

The scenario I'll post below (which makes it plainly fucking obvious to
ANYBODY with a clue that said ninja'er couldn't possibly have killed the
mob, that there was no doubt we killed the mob - logs or not!) shows that
this uttermost bullshit rule has implications from soloing/kiting to exp
groups to full-scale raids.

Before the story, I'll give a little background.
Halls of honour - a tier 3 PoP zone - has a set of 3 trials, which upon
completion of all, gives access to HohB(aka the zone to fight Mithaniel).

The trials arent exactly what you would call easy, its the kind of event
where you know each and every guild that has completed them on your server.

Anyway 1 trial in particular, it involves 3 rooms, a lot of level 65 mobs,
and 3 level 68 named guys.
In each room spawns around 8 mobs, all level 65.  Once all these guys are
dead, a named spawns, who you must kill before going to the next room, and
repeat the cycle (there is a time restraint here).

Each of the named can drop some pretty nifty loot, but because of the fairly
chaotic nature of the event (all 8 mobs pop together), and the time
restraints, you really have to complete the cycle before going back and
announcing loot winners.

So the trial is passed, the guild officers take tells on the loots, and
winners are announced. But wait, one of the corpses is no longer there!
Whilst we were tied up with the event, somebody had come into the basement
and looted our ring.

A gm is contacted, and the situation is discussed.  His reply however,
because we didn't /report the kill, it could not be proven we had killed the
mob.

Now sure, in some zones and mobs this could be argued, but a zone with
pretty limited access?  An event which requires a pretty damn big guild?
(aka something the top 3 guilds on your server could kill).

Don't fucking tell me we need proof that said-ninja didn't kill the beast
himself, there is NO WAY IN FUCKING HELL it could be solod.  Every person in
the zone minus my guild together, couldn't even get to that stage of the
trial, let alone fucking kill it!

If a level 1 naked warrior has tormax loot and is petitioned for stealing,
its pretty fucking obvious he ninjad.  Infact we've had the exact thing
happen on Tormax, and always had the loot returned.   At the same time, if
your not level 65 in one of the servers biggest guilds, its pretty fuckin'
obvious you didn't just pass the 3 HoH trials.

But alas, the gms are retards, or just plain don't care.

So ninjas rejoice,  because we didn't /report the killshot on the mob,
somebody was allowed to legally keep the following stolen ring-
Intricately Inscribed Band
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP
AC: +8 Sta: +15 Wis: +12 Int: +12 Fire Resist: +10 Cold Resist: +10 Poison
Resist: +10 Disease Resist: +10 HP: +100 Mana: +100

Stunned, absolutely stunned... and bitterly fucking dissapointed.
