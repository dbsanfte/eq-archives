I have seen many different formulas posted.  Is there anyone who has had
time to test and can verify which one is correct.

Formulas I have seen:

1 point of wisdom/intelligence is worth 10 mana

mana=level*(2+(wis or int*.02))

mana=level/5*wis or int

I would love to know so I would know whether mana items are best at my level
or wisdom/intelligence items are best.

I am sure this has been asked a 1000 times, but I ran a search and could not
find the answer in this newsgroup.  I know a few sites have mana calculators
and they look like they are based on the last formula.

Any and all help is greatly appreciated.
