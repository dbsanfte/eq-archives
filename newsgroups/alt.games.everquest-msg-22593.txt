Simple rule of thumb can be applied here.  It will make it easy to
understand why kiting is ok but what is being discussed here is an
exploit.  A mob should never run away to get closer.  When kiting the
mob will always be moving towards you, while when exploiting the mob
will be running farther away in order to get closer.  Note that at the
end of a fight when a mob is on its death march, it is NOT trying to get
closer so this rule is not applicable.  This reasoning is why fear
kiting is not an exploit based on this same rule of thumb, as while it
is feared it is NOT trying to get closer.  So in short, if the tactic
relies on using pathing to make a mob run away to get closer, its an
exploit.
