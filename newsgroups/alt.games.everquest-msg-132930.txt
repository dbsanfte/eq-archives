Trying to start my druid epic. I haven't done anything that they all tell
you not to do but, as a druid halfling I am not liked by the guy in Burning
Wood (well, let's put it this way, he is rude to me and won't give me
anything (called me slime, the cad)). I am going to try wolf form but,
meanwhile, of the first 15 or so hits from my internet search on "the muffin
quest" virtually all of them are "If he won't ..... do the muffin quest"
type comments but no one tells you what the muffin quest is. One thread I
found talks about, oh I had to hand in 300 muffins, my friend had to hand in
3000 muffins, my niece's daughter had to hand in one muffin, my
brother-in-law's sister's dog had to hand in 1000 muffins, etc. but no one
tells you what the d*m% quest is. So, what is the muffin quest please?
