To let someone inspect your item, take them off and 
click once on the person you want to let inspect them.  
Make sure the inspecting person isn't moving, or you may 
drop them on the ground.

From there they can right click on the item (or if it's 
in a bag, open the bag and inspect the item) and see 
what it's stats are for themselves.  Typing out all 
those stats is a PITA sometimes so it's nice.  They 
can't 'take' the item unless you hit the 'trade' button 
which, obviously, you should NOT do.  When they're done 
they'll usually hit cancel - some will try and use THIS 
to scam you, however, by hoping that the following 
happens:

When you take off armor and put it in the trade window, 
and then cancel the trade, the game (for some incredibly 
STUPID reason) will not place it back on your body, but 
will try and put it back in your inventory.  If you 
don't have a large enough slot open, it will fall to the 
ground - and then they can pick it up and disappear.

I wish they'd make it so you could just right click on 
the item and get stats when you're inspecting someone 
(although not on th PvP servers, since people seem to 
hate that - although it seems to me if you're playing 
PvP you'd have a pretty good idea about what your 
opponent is wearing - but anyway, I'm tangenting here), 
or at least make it so the equipment gets put back on 
your body.  Or make it so that a message comes up saying 
you don't have room in your inventory, and all the items 
appear on your mouse, ready to be put back into place.  
SOMETHING so that you're not stuck juggling bags.
