}Ok, I'm working on increasing some of my melee skills. I was told you can

}you need to be fighting in order to increase your skill?

I, too, have gotten combat skill increases from green mobs before.  My 
personal theory is this:  your odds of a combat skill increase are 
proportional to X=(mob's level-your level).  Probably not directly 
proportional, but the slope of odds of increase vs. X would always be 
positive. :)  So there's a chance of getting an increase from a green 
mob, but it's much lower than a blue, even, yellow or red.  

I don't think I've ever gotten an increase on a green mob that did not 
also give me exp, but I won't swear to it.

}I've also noticed this for XP as well. I thought you only got XP for blue
}and above. But i've killed things that were green and everyonce in a while,
}I get XP. NOT alot mind you, but the window reports it and I can see it in
}the XP window.

Yep, at most levels, the hardest green mobs will still give you exp.  But 
only a tiny sliver.
