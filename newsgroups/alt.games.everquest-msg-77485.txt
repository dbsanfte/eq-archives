Probably would be fun, but I actually think it would suck if Verant did
repop the warders without an adequate in-game explanation.  As I understand
the story to this point, the warders were there precisely to stop the
Sleeper from being awakened.  Now he has been awakened, so even if the
warders were alive again, there would be no reason for them to stay.  Unless
Verant made the Sleeper respawn in the tomb as well, which would really
cheapen the story a bit.

I have read somewhere . . . maybe even on this group, that there could be a
quest made later to help recapture Kerafym.  Probably just wishful thinking
at the moment, but it would certainly show more imagination on Verant's part
than simply recycling the biggest single event to happen on any given server
to date.

It brings up an interesting issue though.  I, as a player, am envious (in a
good way if there is such a thing) of anyone who even saw the Sleeper, and
orders of magnitude more of those who got him to come on out and play.  But
in character, I am not at all certain those involved should EVER again enjoy
good faction with any of the dragons, or for that matter with any
intelligent, organized race on Norrath, good, neutral, and evil alike.

The way I picture it, the newspapers in Neriak would not revel in the
thought this group of people had released a thing that could make Freeport
the work of an afternoon.  Rather, I suspect they would have headlines
leaping off the front page about the awesome new danger, prominently listing
the names of those fools who had put their enitre civilization at risk for
personal gain . . .

Once again, let me stress that I, the flesh and blood, am happy for all
those who have gone as far in the game as anyone has.  The above is only how
my toon in the Povar universe would see things.
