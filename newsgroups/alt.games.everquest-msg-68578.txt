Yeah, it does help. Last night I installed Luclin on a Celeron 1.1GHz
machine with 1GB PC133 sdram, of which 64MB is allocated to video, leaving
960MB available for system use. It passes all the DX8 diagnostics. We'll try
it out this weekend and so how it shapes up. I'm willing to spend what it
takes to get this game running well, but not any more than that :)
