i can see from this post that this conversation is truely meaningless to
you.  apparently, you do not realize that a conversation, ANY conversation,
can be learned from.  unfortunatly, the only thing you seem to be in this
for is simply to insult someone over something as small as capitalization.
so i bringing this to a close.  go ahead and say whatever you want.  i can
hear it now "he just realized he was being ignorant," and "he had to go cry
into a pillow."  but know this: i end this, not because of any kind of
emotional trauma, but simply because i believe that two people should be
able to discuss something without anger, rudness, and constant
misunderstandings.  go ahead and post as much as you want (in fact, i expect
you to), but expect no more from me.  i only hope that one day your eyes
open and you become more accepting of other people.

i suggest you read Cormac McCarthy's "All the Pretty Horses."  it is a well
known book written by a well known author that even won the national book
award, and yet there is as little punctuation as possible.  there are no
quatation marks, few commas, etc.  maybe it will help you with your
acceptance of people who feel that rules can be bent and even broken, when
done in the right way.
