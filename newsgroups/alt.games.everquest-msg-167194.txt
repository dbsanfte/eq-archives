I bought a Misty Thicket Picnic for the stats and promtly ate it.  Oh well,
it was a cheapie.  I would like to keep one of these and the drink item with
+5 WIS on me but I don't want to keep eating it all the time as it would get
a bit expensive.  I was told that if you eat food manually from time to
time, that it will allow the item to stay in the top slot without being
eaten.  Is this true? If so:

How often you would have to feed yourself the various types of food in order
to stay full?  Snack, Meal, Banquet, Miraculous Size Meal.

Does race and class have anything to do with how much you eat?  It would
seem like a halfling would eat less than an Ogre.  Are there any differences
in the game that anyone knows of?

Also, is there a way to eat an item without putting it in a main inventory
slot and right clicking it?  I usually don't have a slot available.
