 SoW - Jboots, sow potions.
 Gate - Gate potions, Gate hammer!
 Enduring Breath - EB items
 Lev - Safe fall. Who needs lev?
 Camo - Numerous items with invis charges
 Bind - Who cares? I only need one spot.
 Harmony - Who needs harmony? FD split works indoors; unlike Harmony
 Snare - I kill them fast enough that snare normally doesn't matter.

 So they exist? They are easily worked around. So.. What are the
downsides of my monk again?

 It is for those of use who "rushed to 60 as fast as possible". I could
give a hoot about the pre-60 game at this point. Having said that, a lot
of those items above aren't even related to the 60 only game. As a
matter of fact not one of them is.
