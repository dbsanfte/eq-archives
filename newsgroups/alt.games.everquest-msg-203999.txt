Is it really that bad on Xev?  On Karana, people port/zone in and call a 
camp check and if someone /shouts "Stormy", you typically hear "Good 
luck!"  "Try not to go crazy!" "A guildie got him 11 hours ago, if that 
helps", etc.

I have 3-4 guildies that do this camp off and on since we have killed Lodi 
a lot and they have never complained about KSers hanging around.

A lot of people on the Lodi or SF camps just continually call out the camp 
every 10 minutes or so to alert everyone as to why they are sitting on 
their asses in case the new people in zone didn't realize they were 
"camped."
