But even then, you may get aggro, and need to live at least long
enough to channel DA.

So you -better- have maxed out your defense skill, which you
can only have accomplished by deliberately getting hit a lot.
So even if you intend to be a Boss Mob Only cleric in the end
game, you still need to melee a bunch on the way up, or be a
cripple only capable of half what the class can manage (and
I see a -lot- of crippled clerics, by the way)
