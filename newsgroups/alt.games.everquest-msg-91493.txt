Not sure what I can tune really.  I have absolutely nothing that
doesn't have to run running.  It works absolutely perfect with other
3d games I play and in every other aspect it is very fast without
one problem.  The machine is strictly for gaming so I have never put
a lot of programs on it for other type apps.  I talked to 3 other
people in game tonight that can't use the new models either.  Some
with better machines than either of ours. I  don't even have 3d sky
on hehe.  Since installing Win XP my trouble has increased somewhat,
but I am gradually getting those bugs worked out.

As for my machine being WAY better than yours, I think not.  You
have nearly double the processor.  Not sure how processor intensive
the game is but I suspect that is the difference.   Anyway I am not
going to do any more to my machine to play EQ as far as hardware
goes.  I may reformat my hard drive this weekend and get everything
started again on a clean install.  Other than that I will just live
with it until I get done with the game.  Been playing for just over
2 years now, and for the most part have had few complaints.  Can't
ask much more than that from a game IMHO.
