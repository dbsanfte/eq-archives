I agree about shaman but not about druid. Druid has the same heals
pretty much, unless you are talking about very high level ones. Druid
has no normal power to keep things away from the paladin, though, nor
any melee helping slow/haste making it not a very good choice. I don't
think paladins have regular fear either, while the druid only has
animal fear. 

I'd say cleric would be about a billion times better choice than a
druid for a paladin. You get the absolute best heals, resurrects for
when things go bad (NOW very level appropriate lower level ones too,
which save you some death XP)

The cleric would also be fairly easy for your pally to power level,
once the cleric gets Atone. I don't think paladins themselves get
that, right?

A druid just doesn't have the direct melee heal capability that a
cleric would have, nor the fear. It doesn't have the direct
slowing/hasting capability that a shaman has. Of the three, it is the
worst to two box with a melee type unless you really know some great
areas for the two of you to use animal fears and fight animals.

With POK, even transportation is kind of moot anymore.
