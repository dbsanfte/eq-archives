Hi guys, I have a question for high damage nukers.  I'm a 35th mage and I
decided to go to Steamfont with 2 guidies, a 35th enchanter and a 25th
cleric.  We were killing gnome guards.  My bolt spell I use does about 330
damage or so.  Its also one hell of a taunt.  I felt a bit useless as I had
to wait for a min or so before I could cast, because the guard would aggro
on me and Id get a beating for awhile.  Do you guys use lower level nukes as
well as your big one, or do you just sit and wait till you think it's a safe
aggro?  Just wondering how it works at the semi higher levels with these
nukes that do a decent amount of damage.
