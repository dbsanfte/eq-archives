Solo I was having a ball with it, and with it and my dual Lamentions I can
duo with a Rogue at some time for a bit of lowbie fun. I keeping an eye out
for a Lodi Belt as that has a 2 hp tick regen (I believe) which would stack
nicely with my 6 hp tic Ikky Breastplate. Throw in a Shammy for a threesome
and we would have quite a ferocious lowbie threesome.

My Rangette is Tunare worshiping and I am saving up my Bazaar profits for
Blessed Faydark Thunderbolt bow  (Dmg 30, Dly 38. Range 250. +5 Str +5 Agi
+5 Dex +5 Wis +10 vsMg +10 vsFire +10 vsCold +50 HP +50 Mana +3.00 Wt) which
I have seen going for 22k-25k.

I plan on being a <traditional > ranger, ie: Solo Bowman. I know - it's the
hard road, but I suspect it may at least generate quite a few (hundred)
humorous death experiences to relate, which is the whole point.  : )
