I am having audio trouble with EQ with SOV and Luclin Installed.  I am
getting choppy, stuttering music when doing anything else besides
remaining still.  Battles are very irritating, and so is just walking
around towns that have music. I have a Soundblaster Live! running
windows XP.  I performed the recommended tasks on the website
(unstalling cards and all programs, installing Liveware 3.0, then
installed the Windows XP latest drivers (11/29/01), and that did not
fix the problem.   Other info that may be helpful:

1000Mhz Pentium III system
512 Ram (upgraded just for EQ)
Geforce2 MX 200 Video
Soundblaster Live! Soundcard

Happens in the game if I run at 800X600 or the next step
(1028x948?)..have not tried others, nor would I want to play at other
resolutions.  I have options set to less than recommended (only have
sound and Dynamic lighting checked, and only have 8 races set for the
advanced graphics, and texture quality on high).

Is this a common problem?  Any recommendations on how I can fix this?

Thanks,
