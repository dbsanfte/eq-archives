Three kinds of ways to play a druid:
1. Extreme animal lover and wolf/bear cuddler, will never kill a bear
or wolf and scorn those who do
2. Pragmatic, will kill animals (except the holy ones in Surefall) if
needed for any number of reasons (peltsfor tailoring armor, meat,
helping someone in trouble, culling the herd, destroying rabid
animals) <-- me
3. Dr00d, will kill anything that drops phat lewt, including HQ bear
pelts for 10 slot backpacks
