I wish they had something like that.  I usually have 7 or 8 quests I have
components for that I can't complete cuz I don't remember what to do with
the junk, but I don't dare destroy cuz I'll remember the next day.

Look up stuff on everquest.allakhazam.com and print it or write it down in a
notebook. I have several books around here that are for that, not to mention
all the pieces of paper I wrote stuff on, I've gone thru reams of printer
paper when I didn't have ink for the printer.

Have fun
