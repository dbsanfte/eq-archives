For my part, I prefer to make my own maps, and really don't get the 
value of just downloading them en masse from a website...sure the 
'quality of my maps' tends to be pretty sketchy for while... but all you 
really need is the basic layout...

but that aside....

Just open the map files, they're a text file, and the format is such 
that a halfwit could figure it out. Do a search and replace on the r,g,b 
  values you don't like with ones you do. Takes maybe all of 10 seconds.

cheers,
:)
