Wrong. Win95 does not support DX8.1. This is an intentional decision by
Microsoft (not Verant) to phase out ALL support for Win95. You could damn
Microsoft for this, or buy a Mac.

As will all new games that use DirectX. It is the latest 3D API from
Microsoft.

Indeed. In fact they told people that Win95 could run SoL using Directx8.0a.
I doubt they lied. I think they believed that was true up to the point where
they decided to use features in DX8.1. It seems likely that this decision
was based on a desire to improved the game by using advanced features,
rather than to intentionally screw their Win95 customers. Again, Verant does
not support DX, Microsoft does. It is Microsoft that has decided to "screw"
Win95 owners. Then again, Microsoft may have decided that it was simply too
expensive to maintain an outdated OS and it makes far more sense to add
support to current/future products.

> 4) Those who are still using Win95 (for whatever reason) have 4 choices:

I'd go with XP, or you may be in the same boat 2 years from now. At least
with XP you'l probably get 5 or 6 years.

>  - cancel their account until they can fit $100 for a game into their
budget

Seems reasonable. The VAST majority of EQ customers are already off of
Win95. You expect Verant to stop advancing their product for the few people
that cannot upgrade? At what cost? The continual degradation of EQ to
competing products? EQ's graphics engine was already far behind other games
and it still is. At least future upgrades will be possible with a supported
API.

>  - ask for a refund and not only lose their account but all their
characters

I would choose one of the other options, unless I never intended to play
this GAME again.

>  - do nothing until they upgrade to Win98, continuing to give Verant money

Option 2 is still better. 1 is probably best.

You know, I was just out of college and couldn't afford a new car when they
decided to ban lead from gasoline. Son of a bitch, not 4 months after the
lead disappeared than the valves in my 66 Malibu burned out. The Government
didn't reimburse me for crap - not even a free license plate. Nothing, nada.
It seems that all these people decided they would rather have the valves in
my POS car burn up (which worked fine till then, BTW) than to get cancer. Go
figure.

Verant is not responsible for providing Everquest to all people on all
platforms in perpetuity. They are not responsible for Microsoft's decision
to phase out Win95. They are not even responsible for providing the best
possible game/entertainment to to maximum number of people, but that at
least makes good business sense - and that is what they decided to do.
