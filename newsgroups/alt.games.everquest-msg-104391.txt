Hated seeing people killing them poor guards.  Still don't like guard
killers.  They should make guards no xp and no loot like the merchants and
big whopping faction hit too; ie: if they are ally go all the way down to
KOS from one kill.

Saw a darkelf being smacked on at wiz spires in NK once.  Wanted to help him
but I didn't dare because I didn't want faction hit.  Hey, I'm just starting
to learn about the different factions and consequences of killing certain
things, don't want to heal up a darkelf only to have my good factions
totally screwed.  Poor guy got his shard from the scion and ran off with the
guard in tow still attacking him.  Me and a bard started talking about
whether we should have helped him out. We both came to the conclusion we
shouldn't.  One minute before the port went up, the dark elf comes back
still with the guard in tow. Only now the guard is down to less than half
health.  I stand watching the fight until we port up.  When we get up to the
nexus, I clap for the darkelf and heal him up and give him SoW and
riftwind's protection while asking him how the heck he survived that and
apologizing for not helping him out earlier.  He understood that I couldn't
help out on Norrath and was nice about it.  I'm glad he didnt get killed.
He explained that the guard at that spire is a known problem for evil races
and he's always prepared to fight when he goes there.

I'm rambling today I see, hehehe
