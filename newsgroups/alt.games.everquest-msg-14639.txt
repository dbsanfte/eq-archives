They drop in the temple of veeshan.

Since you didn't know this, I can tell you that you are not able to hunt
there yet.

Requirements for ToV:

1) Minimum of 2 *very* well balanced groups...4-5 groups is more typical.

2) Level 51+

3) Be able to achieve ALL resistances (except maybe disease) at 100
UNBUFFED. Anything less, and you can expect to
a) Die a lot (like every 2-3 fights)
b) Suck up a huge amount of healing mana which leads to...
c) Kill a lot of your groupmates

4) Be able to maintain 100+ Magic resist simultaneously with your other
resist also being 100+ (again...unbuffed). Bring a couple of large bags
with resist gear to swap out as needed to bring up whatever resist is best
for the AE of the next pull.

5) Must have the ability to spend at least 3-4 hours solid there. 8-10 is
typical

6) The ability to be patient enough to go through a couple of dozen raids
in order to get a full suit. Since you are either a monk or a druid, you
are much better off than someone wanting plate (as the plate drops are
shared by 5 classes, and the leather drops by only 2).

7) Ally faction with Kromzek, and at least dubious faction with KingTormax
(A non-KOS mage using CoH can get around the Tormax requirement for anyone
but a bard or shaman)...technically this isn't a requirement to hunt in
ToV, but it sure as hell is needed to actually do the quest that the
ancient tarnished stuff is for.
