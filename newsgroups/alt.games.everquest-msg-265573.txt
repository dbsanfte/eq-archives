I had the few LP I wanted by the time I was 30, and kept Leadership off 
most of the time after that, but whenever anyone in the group wasn't 
working on LP I'd ask for the leadership anyway, because the abilities 
were useful

I go this one, very handy, always missed it when I wasn't leader.  Made 
me a favorite of enchanters too.  This is, by the way, almost certainly 
the "target thingy" referred to in the OP's post.

But the other one I got wasn't on your list;

Spell Awareness.  Adds the name of the spell being cast to all casting 
messages you "hear".  Doesn't actually add spam, as there's no new line, 
just each line is a little longer with < spell > at the end.

I loved it because as a berserker I always had a stun available, but on 
a 12 second timer, so I could only stop one spell in three if a mob was 
serious about casting.  With this I could ignore Retribution and stop 
Complete Heal, ignore DOTs and stop Slows, basically pick and choose 
what I needed to deal with.

And I could see what people in my party were doing, which was really 
almost more useful than what the mobs were doing.  Not to mention really 
amusing when the caster in question didn't have GOD and I'd ask why they 
were casting a specific spell... them having no idea where I found out 
what they were casting!
