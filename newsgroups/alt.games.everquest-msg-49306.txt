   I like to look at playerauctions.com.  I dont
bid on stuff, but I like to see what is available.
But today, when I tried to enter the website, I
was dumped back to desktop.  I can understand getting
a website not found error if it were gone, but
I dont understand why I would be dumped back to
desktop. 
     Any ideas why that would happen?
