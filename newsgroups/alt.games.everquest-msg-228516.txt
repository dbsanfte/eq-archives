There are Frogs in PoS that don't summon and can be snared.  It would
take you an eternity to DoT them down however and one badly timed stun
and you'd be toast.

Not sure about the Frogs in PoV, I think they are randomly immune to
snare which might make things 'challenging'.  Having said that the
light-blue-to-65 dire charm fodder spawns might be decent xp for you.
