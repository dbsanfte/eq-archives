Now you've gone and made it sound like an interesting challenge.  :)
I'm wondering why I haven't heard about it being at least attempted
(as opposed to being joked about here).  There's got to be at least

be part of the team that managed to do it.  Or are top-end Rangers
so terribly few and far between?
