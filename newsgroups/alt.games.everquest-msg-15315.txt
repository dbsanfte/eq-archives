 Generally on the East side of the zone (I like NE) it's good for 20+
level people as well. The mobs there are in the 16-21 level range if I
remember correctly. When I was there it was constant mobs (non social
ones by the way other than Sarnaks) since nobody else was around.
There's also a vendor right there if you need food/water/bandages. I
found this much better than Ill Omen.
