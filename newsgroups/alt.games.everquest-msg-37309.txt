    I would just like to say I love the game Brad and crew have come up
with. There, butt kissing is done now down to the facts.

    When you need tech support, forget it. Sorry, we make 3 mil a month on
you turds we don't need to help 1 or 2 of you, that's their attitude. Want
an 800 # for help? Sorry we can afford it on 3 mil a month.

    From everything I have seen from Verant, from someone who has followed
EQ since over a year before it came out... their products are nice, but
their customer service is on par with a hotdog vendor. Next Verant game
comes out they can count me out as a customer because of their lack of
respect for the folk who made them rich.

    That's all I've got to say.
