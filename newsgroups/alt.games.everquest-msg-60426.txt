It would be simple to test this out.

Make a level one character, making note of his attributes and HP/AC/ATTK
scores.  Provide him with a small stack of bone chips or muffins or parts
for
any other simple exp quest.  Takes very little to level up to 2.  Note the
increase
in HP/AC/ATTK.

Now make an identicle character (delete the first one if you need room) and
give him attribute increase gear.  Level him up exactly the same way, then
have him take off the increase gear and look at the HP/AC/ATTK.

I'd be quite surprised if they were not identicle to those of the first test

character at level two.

But you wouldn't be taking anyones unsubstantiated word for it.

And before anyone says that Verant told them it isn't true, I'd like
to point out that Verant often seems to have no idea what is going
on and how things really work in their program.  Whether they are
in error or deliberately lying is impossible to determine, of course...
