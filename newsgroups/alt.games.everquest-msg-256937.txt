    At the end of Luclin or so, Triton went into the zone and AE'd the place
silly. The guards were relative undercons, and they made mad XP. SOE saw
this and nerfed the guards so AE just isn't possible, so now there nothing
to kill. Well, maybe nothing to kill. One of the heads of a house there
(Fordel? can't recall) was a level 70 or so undercon. Hit so weakly that one
of our guild paladins would solo her - this is at level 60, end of Luclin.
She just had a fair chunk of HPs was all. She also repopped in like five
minutes. If she hasn't been nerfed, you could always kill her, but you would
end up KOS to pretty much everything in town.
