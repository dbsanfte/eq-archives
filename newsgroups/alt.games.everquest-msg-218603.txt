Im telling you that alot has changed with the new celerons.
And while, yes.. I do read magazines and forums as well as benchmark results
on a WIDE variety of hardware to help me make better decissions, I am
speaking to you from experience on this.  if you still dont wanna hear what
I have to say then ill stop offering my advice. but I *am* right in this
matter and you will never change my mind on that.


On a side note, didnt you make a post once stating your fastest machine was
a 333mhz ? you cant possibly have that much experience. even if you use a
high end machine at work I doubt they let you play games of consequence on
it.

My fastest machine is a 2.53 ghz, and my slowest machine is a p120. and i
have 5 more machines inbetween. so yes i feel like i have a little more
experience in this field than you do.
