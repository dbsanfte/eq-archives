BoT has gotten really bad on EMarr.  It sounds and feels just like KC 
now.  Not being l337 here, it's just the seriously inane ooc, and the 
constant trains and camp jumping that are now occuring that has really 
started to bug me.

You could have gotten access to tier 2 and 3 planes without your guild, 
lots of pickup groups were happenning for doing the PoV/PoS access 
trials.  There are alternate quests, as well as plenty of pickup raids, 
for access to the various tier 3 planes.
