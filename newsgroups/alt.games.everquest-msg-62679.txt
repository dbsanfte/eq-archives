But if the server wasn't aware you had it, it seems the fact your damage
output potential will change the moment you equip it imply that:

a)  Damage is, contrary to popular belief, calculated client side
b)  A save is forced when you equip the weapon.  A save which, by the way,
is not broadcast over the client.

If scenario a) were true, you could be right, but in such a case, why bother
duplicating an existing sword, when the would-be cheater could simply "tell"
the server he delivered a max damage crit every single swing of the sword.
Or for that matter, he could possibly invent his own sword with phenominal
statistics (depending on whether Verant also maintains a database of all
existing weapon types against which to compare the weapons it finds in its
char files -- seems unlikely to me).

If scenario b) is true, it begs the question.  Why would Verant allow a save
to be forced on the equipping of a weapon and not the trading or looting of
said weapon, as the former strategy would be both less efficient and less
foolproof?

I think Dark Tyger is right on this one.  The client seems to me to be very
little more than a really nice interface, with all meaningful events
happening on Verant's machines.
