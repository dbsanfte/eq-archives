Hm. I suppose that you subscribe to Freud's notion that "all art is anal", 
and creativity is nothing more than the adult sublimation of a child's 
excrement-smearing impulses. That would be the only rational explanation 
for anybody thinking that those names constitute in any way "creativity".

Worry not... If we decided to flame you for your "truthful" comments, there 
is plenty of ammo there already. We hope that having to admit to using 
WebTV is embarrassing enough without us having to point and snicker.
