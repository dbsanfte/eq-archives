LOL...it only just dawned on me, after all my trying to make people realize
SoL needs a lot more horsepower to run then original EQ, that my second
computer (which, in reality, is only on EQ once in a while) is not "SoL
Ready" ......hehe oh well....

So, yeah, when you have to upgrade multiple machines, cost becomes a must
bigger issue....I've also heard rumors of the MX either being totally
discontinued or only available to OEM (dell, gateway, etc), real soon...not
sure if that's true or not.....
