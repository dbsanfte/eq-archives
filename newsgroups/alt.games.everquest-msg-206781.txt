How To Make Money In Jewelcraft. First, spend 20kpp getting your skill up
to a useful level... :)

Don't buy gear if you can avoid it. You can get by on your newbie armor
(or even cloth) for quite a while. And your melee damage is already laughable
and getting worse. A 250pp stick won't change that. There's a number of
nice questable items from PoK that are cheap to get: the spell haste mask
and the mana preservation ring. Int gear is nice *if you can afford it*,
but isn't necessary. Frankly, some of the newbie armor pieces have better
Int than you can buy for under 100pp. And you'd be surprised how far you
can get in plain old cloth with 120 Int...

Loot! A lot of casters lose out on loot by letting the melees do all the
looting and trusting to autosplit to even things out. Don't fall for that!
Having a main looter is best, if you can find someone you trust (have one
guy loot everything, with autosplit turned off. at the end, have him sell
the swag and split the proceeds). Second best would be having a loot
rotation policy. Grouping with twinks who can't be bothered to loot is
great, but don't count on it. And don't ever let anything vendable item
rot if you can help it.
 
Some places have much better loot than others. Unrest and Warrens for the
mid to high teens. Aviaks in SK and LR teens to mid 20's. Goblins in SolA
or Lizards in Feerrott for mid 20's to 30's. Finding a regular group or
partner will greatly increase the number of places you can hunt.

Three words: Stein of Moggok. A LORE +10 int item that enchanters can quest
at L12 or earlier. Sells for 150pp or more. Takes less than an hour to
do if you've got PoP. If feeding Regurgitonic to Frostbite is broken on
your server (has been on Xev for months), you may have to make a fish
killing mule.

Other than training that first point in a skill, there's almost nothing
worth the plat cost of training up. Spell casting skills you can do on
your own while fishing in town. Melee skills go up on their own when you
use them, but as a caster aren't that big a deal. The only ones I could
imagine training up past 20 would be those "tradeskills" you can do that
with: Research, Make Poison, Tinkering(?) and Alchemy(?).

Some data points: Our SK+SHM duo (L24..L32) was making about 80pp a night
each, hunting goblins in SolA, from bronze weapons, cash, and blocks of
ore. I was main looter. Probably could have made more if we hadn't given
the spare drakescale belts and kobold hide boots to our alts. Our SK+SHM
duo (L15..L17) in Warrens made 50-75pp a night each from bronze weapons
and kobold molars. My soloing BST (L23..L30) was making about 120pp a night
hunting the lizards in Feerrott from fine steel weapons. My cleric (L28..L33)
made about 10-20pp a night in Splitpaw in pickup groups, trusting to the
fairness of autosplit. Clearly some camps and loot schemes are more lucrative
than others.
