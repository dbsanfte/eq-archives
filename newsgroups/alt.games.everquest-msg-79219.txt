Bah, Ararah is level 15, and has been sitting at the Sarnack Fort in LOIO 
for about 2 months, untouched.  (Yeah, he's a bit twinked as he was 
leveling on mobs 5-6 levels above him.)   A warrior just doesn't seem to 
hold my interest, not enough going on there.  Hitting taunt every few 
seconds just seems rather simplistic, but I expect that almost any class 
will seem simple compared running a 3-song twist all the time.  
That being said, I'm starting to really enjoy playing around with my baby 
necro now that I moved her to WK instead of the Warrens.  I would probably 
make a monk if I were seriously looking for a new character, but I still 
have to make 60, then I have 324 alt exp levels to play with.

Arolpin
happy bard
