YV  pet  MoR or MoK YV heal melee bash bash YV bash bash heal YV
bash bash YV root next target attack next target (breaking mez to get pet
attention on next mob before it suicides) back off till first mob dies, dive
back in till MA gets close enough to mob to prevent hammer from biting
off more than it can chew, back off, YV MoR or MoK click AE heal legs
YV click legs YV click legs YV melee bash bash heal YV melee
bash...

This plan is only 10 mana per tic less mana flow than sitting, and adds in
damage comperable to a 50something warrior along with the occaisional
spell interrupt while working on your bash skill.  Facing a mob where
interrupting spells is critical, take out all those bashes and instead
substitute
in "watch for casting to begin and bash as needed"

The bit with the pet is really just showing off, unless you've convince the
chanter to Haste the thing, simply replacing it with a new one will work
just as well and won't waste much mana really.

Other things you could be doing with your time instead of just sitting and
healing: stun to interupt casters, root adds away from the fight (cleric mez)

hit incoming buffed mobs with your cancel line (do this before any
of your party's debuffs are laid on) and play Gems.
