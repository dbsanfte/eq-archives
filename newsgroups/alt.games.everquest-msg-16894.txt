Clarification.  This is not hacked (more intended for this threads
originator), this is usually classified as, errm, duh'd.

Duh'd - (origin: idiots)

n. The sound produced after someone does something like this.
v. To have made the sound produced after doing something like this.



Another recommendation to this duh'd user.  DO NOT create another account
with the same "owner"/billing name, else you will find yourself duh'd again.
