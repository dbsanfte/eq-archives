Are you sure?  I am indeed offering to trade in platinum... but
not for real world cash or anything of real world value.

Is it an EULA violation to offer to tell someone how to get from
qeynos to halas for plat?

How about to offer to heal them for plat?

At what point does trade in PP constitue a violation, anyway?
Now if I was offering cash for plat, probably.  If I was offering
to report successful login for cash, maybe.  But I figured
successful log in for PP would be game information for game
"commodity" and pretty safe.

I sure wouldn't want the SONY EULA enforcement team on my case,
why my account might get banned sometime in 2010~!
