Oh I don't use Scourge at all really, it's really quite out of place next
to VoS in the Shaman spell list and feels just as feeble now as it did when
my Necro got it a year ago.  The level 34/39 DoTs I currently have are
seriously starting to suck but that will change at 49 with E-Bolt.  Plague
I'm not convinced about as my Necro had Splurt by the time she got Plague
so it remained virtually unused.

Current method of soloing: use slow to pull the mob then Venom of the Snake
then (hasted) Dogdog in usually.  If mob is hitting hard then I'll tank for
the pet for a while as I can still easily stand toe-to-toe with slowed dark
blues at 46 and my melee damage isn't too shabby even now with Rune Etched
Icewurm Fang, decent haste item, Alacrity, Fury etc.  Back off to spam
Canni 2 as much as I can stand and refresh VoS/re-tank if Dogdog is getting
chewed up too badly to get the mob fleeing on his own.

Problem is getting the balance right with mana expended and time taken to
kill the mob as I'm not keen on having to re-slow.

Should really cave into the temptation and just buy KEI in Nexus to be
honest.
