	I think most of my gain is simply the fact I don't have to spend my

	have sow and constantly patrolling, you'll never get a single HG
	before the druids do.  I'll still have to med a bit, but not so much
	that I'll never find my next kill.

	If there wasn't so much competition for HGs, especially from druids,
	I don't think I'd need KEI nearly as much as I could actually med
	and when done actually find a HG to kill within five minutes.

:>>Forced down time requirements is something I've never liked and EQ is
:>>horrid about this.
: 
: This is just silly.  I've watched people bitch about this for years. EQ
: does NOT force you to spend all your mana in one or two fights, you CHOOSE
: to play that way.  You are NOT forced to have downtime. You take a class
: that has the option of focussing its power in relatively short bursts (as
: opposed to a melee who does not get that option) and then you whine about
: having to wait until you can once again briefly have power way beyond what
: would be "balanced" for your level.

	My main chars are a monk and necro.  The necro doesn't have nearly
	the down time issues as the mage.  I never get KEI as a necro and
	probably never will.  IMHO it's balanced pretty well.  I can't dump
	all my mana into every mob, but at least I'm not forced to sit my
	ass down and med after every single fight regardless how
	mana-efficient I am.

	The mage however, *must* med, for *ages*.  No I don't blow the hell
	out of every mob.  We're talking pet, dmg sheild, 1 nuke, maybe a
	pet heal.  Poof, down nearly a couple bubs of mana.  Get a single
	add?  To simply live we're likely talking about the entire mana bar. 
	The pet heals aren't powerful to thank two blues at this lvl and the
	pet isn't uber enough to solo both on its own simply by your heals. 
	You're forced to outright nuke one or gate (gate implies 5 minutes
	and 1/2 a mana bar to recast your pet and pet gear).

	Under the best of fighting conditions a soloing mage is going to
	have significant downtime; always more downtime then fight time.  In
	small groups it's only a little better.  You really need a full
	group that isn't moving to avoid downtime.

	My necro OTOH doesn't have nearly this kind of problem.  Fights can
	last far longer without nearly the mana burn, between more efficient
	mana use and self-crack it's entirely possible to have little or no
	down time.  Solo or group he's able to significantly minimize
	downtime.

	Most pure casters have some decent form of mana regen and general
	ability to minimize downtime.  Mages really don't.  You get KEI or
	you deal with sitting twice as much as fighting.

:>> It's simply not fun.  It isn't a "feature", it's a bug.
: 
: Play a damned melee if you don't like it.  It is a feature of your class
: that you are not required to exercise your power evenly over time.

	My Iksar monk also has minimal issues with down time.  Bandage,
	mead, regen.  And you know what?  I can take an add solo without
	requiring a good 15 minutes of recovery time.

: A solo caster whining about recovery time is and always has been the
: stupidest bitch in EQ.  Actually I should have said that it <was> a
: feature of your class.  Now it is a feature of your class that it is
: ridiculously overpowered.  Or perhaps, since casters and caster classes
: outnumber melees, it would be more accurate to say that, with KEI commonly
: available, melees (excluding extreme twinks under L50) are once again as
: badly underpowered as they were early in the history of the game.

	It's not all casters; just a few.

	But alas I'm talking about recovery time in general, not just
	casters.  Bandaging only upto 50% for instance, especially given how
	weak bandages are even at high skill, is pathetic.

: And that's why KEI has changed the game.  Now there is no longer a
: meaningful penalty complementing the casters' grotesquely unbalancing
: advantage.  SOE has "cheapened" the experience of the game, bowing to the
: pressure of huge numbers of whiny children demanding that they be able to
: have their cake and eat it too.  That it was inevitable (the whiners are a
: substantial fraction of the player base, SOE likes their money every bit
: as much as anybody else's) does not make it, IMO, a good thing.

	Hmm, Aego, Focus, etc?  Melees can get their crack too...
