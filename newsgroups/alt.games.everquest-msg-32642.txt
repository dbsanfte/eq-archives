I have developed 2 characters on Vazaelle up to level 30. One is a Wizard
and the other is an enchanter.  I went Freeport to No Ro to Oasis to LOIO.
Now the characters have been stagnant for the last month.  The wizard ports
around looking for groups but there just are not any. LOIO does not offer
any groups and suggestions to go places generally lead to empty or quiet
zones where there are characters but no groups.  What would be a
suggestion - a new character - or maybe a different server? Thanks for
suggestions!!
