If this is your first character you will not start to see any serious
cash until you hit your 30s. Most non-twinked INT casters are lucky to
be able to afford all of the spells at level20 much less +Int gear.

Don't try to keep up with other players, and ignore the idiots that
snub you because you aren't equiped with the best gear. Most of the
"rich" characters you see are being funded by higher level characters
on their account. Others have rich friends or guilds that hand down or
sell gear at wholesale prices to them.

Ask yourself, "Why do I play EQ?" 

EQ is about the journey not the destination.

Some things you can do now for cash.

Kill wisps for Lightstones and Greater Lightstones. There is a quest
that uses both. It can net you up to 9pp per greater lightstone. Or
you can sell them to players doing the quest for 5-7pp

Hunt the "Sisters of Erollisi (sp)" in the Ocean of Tears. They drop
Purity belts that will sell to a vendor for about 1P each as well as
bronze weapons, and cash.

Collect Spider silk and make Silk Swatches. Sell the swatches to
tailors (or take up tailoring yourself) for 1-2pp each. 

As a necro your main strength is in your pet. You are not as "gear"
dependant as a melee class.
