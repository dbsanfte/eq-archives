Actually, it's my experience that most 30's I run into these days are alts 
of higher-level players.

What's stupid is sacrificing your own interests merely to accept the 
intentional shortcomings of others - those shortcomings in this case being 
an inability or absence of any desire to learn to play the game *without* 
training wheels negating the need for me to wait on their candy ass to run 
and get a Temp every time the notion strikes them.
