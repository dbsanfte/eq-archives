Here is the story of onboard video.  I had a computer with a P3 450
out perform another computer that had a P3 800 just because of the P3
450 did not have onboard video and the P3 800 did.

Onboard audio is easy to disable because it is normally some pins on
the motherboard or a setting in BIOS.  Onboard video is a different
story.  Some computers auto detect the off board video and disable the
onboard and some have a setting in BIOS or pins to close or open.  The
auto detect boards are worse because it takes time before the
motherboard will full detect the video card there or not.

It is reccomended to take computers with off board video.
