Was passing through Steamfont on my way to Castle Mistmoore to try out
the Hot Spot -- I had a level 25 cleric. Had a free SoW so moving fast
through the kobold camps and onto the road to the Lesser Faydark zone
line when I saw skeletons in noticeable numbers. I'd been here before
so no problem, just SoW run past them and zon... a malevolent knight
hits you for 542 points of damage... a malevolent templar hits you for
142 points of damage... a malignant slinker backstabs you for 243
points of damage... LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...

Back on Plane of Knowledge, some thought it was a GM event. Having
never been in one, I zoned back down and used Invisibility to Undead
which worked. Saw Eldritch gnomes and clockworks run up the road to
fight various malevolent and malignant skeletons. Since the Eldritch
folks came singly, they lost all the time as far as I could tell.

All these skeletons were red to my 25 cleric and I've never seen them
before. I died twice more -- once trying to help a friend (50 ranger)
who was rooted by a skel which popped unexpectedly on us (we were just
observing) and once when the PoK book was trained (I had let ITU fade
for we were far from the skels, right? Doh!).

Notably a number of level 65 characters came Steamfont and generally
seemed to have to flee or die. A number of corpses littered the ground
near the PoK book in Steamfont.

Up by the Windmills in the area by the minotaur caves, I saw swirling
combat between Eldritch gnomes and clockworks with minotaurs,
skeletons, and rats. By this time, I was about the only player still
in the zone -- trusting to my ITU which seemed to work on all the
minos, skels, and rats even though it shouldn't.

A level 65 cleric, on a rezzing mission, was kind enough to rezz (96
pct) my corpses three times which meant I lost only 2 pct instead of
31 pct. My heartfelt thanks to Sirothe.

Still have no idea of what was going on. Things were back to normal
the next day.
