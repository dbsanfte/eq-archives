Nothing is posted as a fix at this time however, some things that may
assist are:

1. Open your eqclient.ini file in Notepad
2. Search for the [default] section
3. Add the line 
      HardwareTnL=FALSE
4. Save and close this file, and try EverQuest once more.
5. If the problem still persists, please also add the line
      VertexShaders=FALSE

Personally I have issues with my ATI card at this time too. A patch is
upon us though, so I'd say get some rest and wait till after the next
patch. It's what I'm doing :)
