I'd say a good target size would be about 40 to 50 on Grummus and about 30
to 40 on TT.  Both can be done with less once you have a good solid strategy
and good class makeup.  I've done Grummus with less than 30 and TT with less
than three full groups.

Both of those fights are challenging, especially when you're first reaching
them.  Some hints:

The key to Grummus is clearing out the adds first.  With a little
experimentation, and no fear, your puller will figure out how to do this for
you.  Make him.  :)  After that, it's all about group heals.

The key to TT is simply knowing what comes next and being ready for it. 
That and regulating *when* what comes next...  comes.
