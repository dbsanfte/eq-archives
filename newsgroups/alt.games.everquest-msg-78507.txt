Not everyone is a twink.  The 1HS's that will out damage a cheap 2HS
at midlevels are EXPENSIVE.  According to Copelands (which may not be
accurate due to changes in the combat system), my 30 ranger does
383/minute with a BABS.  To do better with dual wielded 1HS, I'd have
to get something like a Centi Longsword (Centi LS plus Crystal fiber =
411/minute).  Dual Lammies will do 444/minute.  I paid 125pp for the
BABS.  Centi Longswords go for a couple thousand on my server.  I've
never seen 1kpp.  That is alot of plat for about a ten percent
increase in average damage.

Now, when I start raking in the plat then that Centi is first on my
list of things to do... but right now I still have a few banded pieces
to trade out.
