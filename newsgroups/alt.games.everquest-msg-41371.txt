Heh, I appreciated it too, especially after the spam for some personal
ad website I got yesterday, with the usual 'hi buddy I thought this
might interest you' type header changed into 'GO GIVE BLOOD!'. 
I usually just delete and forget spams, but I swear, if they hadn't
munged their headers (to make it look like Red Cross) I would have
reported that sucker to hell and back.
