Hmm. Well, when you go LD you supposedly become an AI controlled character,
presumably with all the advantages a mob gets (like near-unlimited mana,
etc). Since I don't think you can kill a mob through falling damage (at
least, I've never managed to even get one to take and falling damage I can
see), it might work...

In the middle of a fight the mob will just kick your ass, of course.
