If you can kill Sev, you can get a VP key.  Seriously.  The only hard 
part of the quest is the basement of KC, and killing Trakanon about 20 
times.  Getting a guild outfitted with VP keys takes time, but it's 
definately doable for a mid-50s guild with raid experience.  
We were only a 55+ guild when we started doing the VP quests, and it took 
us from no epic warriors to 4 or 5 epic warriors in a very short time.  If 
you're interested, I can explain some of the strategies for Hoshkar, since 
learning them the old-fashioned way can be more than a little frustrating.  
I also don't have to worry about you guys sneaking in and killing him, 
since you're on a different server.  :)
