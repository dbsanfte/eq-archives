Guess I have a different view. My son accidently got into someone elses
account. He thought he typed in his PW and login but when he got to the
character select screen there was all these characters that he never created
(2 were above 50). He quicklly exited out but a less honest person might
not.
As far as hacking an account, I hear its not that diffulcult...
