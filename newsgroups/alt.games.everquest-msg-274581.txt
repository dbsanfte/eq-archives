    Back before WoW was released, my enchanter (never been in an LDoN 
adventure) was 10800th in the LDoN rankings. That means there were 10800 
characters on the server that had won at least one LDoN adventure. Today, 
she is about 6960th. One fact and two assumptions get you my number:

Fact: characters are removed from the LDoN rankings if the account they're 
on is cancelled, or if they move to another server.
Assumption 1: accounts that are cancelled are neither more nor less likely 
to have used LDoN than an account that is not cancelled.
Assumption 2: the ratio of cancelled accounts to non-cancelled accounts is 
similar between those who used LDoN and those who have never used LDoN.
