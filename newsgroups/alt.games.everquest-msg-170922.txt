Aloha Justisaur,
    Redvet the rogue could get silver by begging...Redakamai the enchanter
has a significantly higher skill level in begging than the rogue ever did
and he has never received a copper. But perhaps someday the begging skill
will be important. Anyway, to rehash the question. For an Enchanter, is
there a period in his life where he can't beg from his pet and has to beg
from Janam? If that is so...does the enchanter ever get to raise that skill
from practicing with his pet again and when? - Redakamia, 28th circle on the
Tov. server
