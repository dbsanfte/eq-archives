The alternative suggestion being to adhere to the ettiquette that has
evolved to provide a productive environment to everyone using the
group.

It is not merely a courtesy - it makes the forum usable for people who
dont use the some software as you. Dont assume that just because something
doesnt cause you problems everyone who requests, bitches or demands you do
it another way doesnt have a valid reason for doing so.

And remember; the bitching and demanding may be out of proportion for *you*,
but put into the context of 790 people doing the same thing every 
week/month/however it becomes as frustrating and rude as the 790th beggar in 
EQ.

Learn to use the forum considerately, and others will be considerate towards 
you...
