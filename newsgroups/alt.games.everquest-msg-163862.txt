You took a gamble and you lost. Ebaying a character, is not just
"wrong" (as per the EULA), it is also risky. The original account
holder ALWAYS retains the ability to take the account back, and Sony
will NOT help you if they do. You knew this, and you still took the
risk. No one here will have any sympathy for you. 

Never gamble more than you are willing to lose. You took your chances
and you lost. Suck it up and move on.

PS Did it ever occur to you that the #1 reason why Sony is against
Ebaying characters is the customer service nightmare people like you
and the account seller would create?
