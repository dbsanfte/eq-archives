My druid is currently sitting at 214 wis (210 if I'm soloing and got
my ES arms on), and his base wisdom is only 85.  Put that same gear on
a halfling or wood elf druid that was rolled up correctly and you're
looking at 244 wis.  The closest piece of equipment I have to "uber"
is my Elysian Crown (lost the roll on the tunic, damnit).  And of all
the droppable equipment I got, total cost is probably in the
neighborhood of 12k, if I'm very lucky.  You could get 230 wis with
zero trauma, and for under 10k.
