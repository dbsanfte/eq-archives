Unless you have your head stuck in a bucket of piranha fish, *I'm*
going to assume that your reading comprehension is lacking. Either
that, or Dan failed to quote the post he's responding to. (I can't
check, since Dan's post hasn't arrived at my server yet. Usenet is
HARD!)

In any case, Dan was in fact responding to *another* post, wherein
James (jamesgrahame@home.com) said the following:

      Oooh! A clue! Let's see if we find more!!!1!!1

Gee, do you think *this* sentence could be another clue? :
>> You know it does, and thanks for the rez.  :-)

Last I checked, Troll Warriors can't cast any spells, never mind rez...

PS: This may read like a flame, but it's meant tongue in cheek.
Without disclaimers like this, the thread could become a massive
FLAME WAR!!!1!, and who'd want that?

PPS: When you make an assumption, you make an ass out of you and
umpion. Geddit? Geddit? Geddit? I DON'T GET IT!!!1!!1!

PPPS: I've hidden another disclaimer in the post! Can you find it?
Collect the whole set, and win an all-expenses paid trip to fabulous
Rivervale, home of Zorro^H^H^H^H^H the halflings!

PPPPS: I've been awake for 26 hours! How soon into the post could
*you* tell?
