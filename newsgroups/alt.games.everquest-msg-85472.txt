Sadly he will need to develop it, if my understanding is correct, or face a
world of pain should he go for his epic. Personally I wish the skill was 
removed immediately. Both because it does make it hard to find groups (and
you can never really prove you are not PP'ing) and because being honourable
and PP'ing off an orc pawn in the commons is boring beyond words.

(and remove the trap skills at the same time, as well as traps, no player has
ever said "wow, that trap was fun").
