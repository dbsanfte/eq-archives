Best:

Dumping the spellbook while meditating. Single worst
idea for a game ever. What ever designer that thought
staring at a static screen for 5-20 minutes at a time should
have their knee caps blown off.

Bazaar. Huge improvement.

Luclin moon ports and the PoK ports. Finally I can actually
get together with my friends to play in a reasonable amount of time.

New interface. Much better than the old one. This has to be the single
most used improvement, you benefit from it every time you play.
Making it customizable is just icing on a great cake.

Worst:

Monk damage mitigation nerf. Didn't hit the target they were aiming at
and hurt casual monk players that solo.

Long time sink key quests.
