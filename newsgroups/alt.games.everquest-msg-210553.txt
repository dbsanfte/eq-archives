I umm, visited NC last week for a week.

Why would this interest you, really?  The great thing about EQ for me
is that it puts me into a pool of fellow players from all around the
world, always someone on when I am.

If you'd said "from the Eastern Standard Time Zone" you'd have a
point, people who are all experiencing the same light/dark cycle you
are... but NC is just a tiny sliver of that time zone, and anyway its
more important to me to find people who play when I play, which
doesn't neccessarily coincide with when people from the same zone, in
fact I was able to play regularly with some people from Sweden and a
lady from Minnesota for a copule years, both had free time at the same
GMT time I did, even though it was what, about 10 hours spread between
the furthest two time zones?

If you'd said "from Fayetteville" you might be interested in fellow
players who you can actually hang out with, maybe you have two
machines; it would be a lot of fun to group with someone who's right
in the room with you, able to use voice and gestures instead of
filtering everything thru text chat.

But NC, thats a big state...

Oh well, just wondering
