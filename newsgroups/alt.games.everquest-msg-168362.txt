No, I don't mean to be rude at all.  A problem with the print medium is that you
really don't get the cues that tone of voice, body language, and facial
expression would give you.  I've heard "emoticons" help with this... but I guess
I'm old school, they just strike me as kitchy.

I"m trying to be helpful by pointing out some things you could have done
differently in the dilemna you described.  Not just for you, though, this isn't
a private conversation, its an open discussion forum.  So while you might have
already figured out things that you'd done wrong, here's an opportunity for
others to learn from your mistakes.

Your body lasts 7 days, while its only rezable for 3 hours.  This leaves 6 days
and 21 hours to loot it to clean it up.  Now its possible that the 450pp wasn't
worth recovering, particularly after your harrowing experiences getting to WW in
the first place, but doing so really wouldn't have been all that difficult,
despite what you may have felt.

Very little, honestly.  Monk is a damage producing class, with no real taunts at
all, duo-ing with one serving as MA is an exercise in aggro control (and
therefore a good thing to do from time to time), in fact I think ANY other class
would be more likely to be able to get something off you on demand.  Given some
time a monk can get aggro unless you try to keep it off him, because he tends to
strike a lot of blows fast and outdamage his companions... but that isn't of
much help in an emergency.

I understand that, but as I say, its an open ongoing discusion.  Whatever you
say in the newsgroup, people are likely to respond to, to build on what you
said, or to contradict it, or even both.

As a cleric who's spent a good deal of time in WW, TOV, DN, SG, and CS, I've
rezed quite a few people who died succoring across SG, and I've crossed it
myself tons of times.  I've succored across, used the "camp out in a corner"
exploit to self succor, and since hitting about 58 have taken to simply running
across (I take a few hundred points worth of damage but its faster than
succoring with my load time)

There's an element of risk to it, as that wandering mob MAY be up, but most of
the deaths occur because he usually isn't up, and so people don't pay attention
while zoning; they look at the paper, get a soda, whatever, while waiting for
the load to be over... and when its over quicker than expected and they happen
to get unlucky and see that wanderer, well, its rez time, since that one mob
turns into three in the blink of an eye.  Another popular cause of death is
running the wrong way on entry, as there are more aggro mobs down those
hallways.

The other element of your story, though, was that WW is a dangerous place.  This
too is true, especially if you are KOS to COV.  Its no more dangerous than EW,
though, if you are prepared for it; with SOW and invis and some way of stopping
velium hounds (which aggro on all and outrun SOW, if your invis happens to drop
while near one) all you need are open eyes.

I also wanted to take issue with your litany of causes of your being KOS to
dragons in WW.  That list was, as I pointed out, not terribly accurate, unless
you had some more detail to add (ie your guild kills Azureake regularly... if
so, I'd like to know what he drops, since I've never seen anyone hunt him)
