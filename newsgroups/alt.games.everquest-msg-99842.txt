I get it in almost all Luclin outdoor zones. There's a memory leak
somewhere dealing with graphics, guaranteed. Luclin really should have
gotten better optimization before it was released. I am over

dawnshroud and shadeweavers, and shar vahl is a *nightmare*. I am
talking <1 fps in the middle area.
