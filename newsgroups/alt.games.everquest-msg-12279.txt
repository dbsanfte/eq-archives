My first character (a dark elf SK) is still my main (and favourite)
character. He's level 52.

Then again, I took my starting stats from castersrealm, so didn't
majorly screw up there. I can't think of any regrets I have with him,
actually... with the possible exception of having missed certain zones
out which are now too low for him.

I'm hoping to rectify that, however, with my other characters as they
gain experience.
