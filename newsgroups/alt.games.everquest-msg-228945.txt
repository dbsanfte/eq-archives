I think Fallout is "Best in Genre", and among the best games of all 
time. I would think so even if there was no magazine rating to back that 
up. I am no more a sheep than you.

To sit there and say "They sucked because I thought they sucked and I'm 
the only one that matters to me." is just being abrasive and obvious. 
Its fine you didn't like them, its fine you think they sucked, but 
"they" are generally right because "they" is *most people*... so if a 
game is rated "best in genre" by "them" its usually worth looking at.
