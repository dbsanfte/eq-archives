Personally, I prefer not wasting my breath on those who deny their
heritage, whether by following the traitoress Lanys or by refusing to
name themselves Teir'Dal. "Drow"... might as well just call yourself
an ogre and be done with it. And if anyone should ever try to call
*me* by that name, I'll use his bones for my next pet.

(In other words, I hate seeing the term 'drow' while I am playing EQ.
I like it about as much as I like being called a dr00d on my main, or
seeing references to hobbits. Actually, 'hobbit' is less grating since
it's even more rare than 'drow' is on my server)
