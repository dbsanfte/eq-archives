    A lot of the "lower" guilds aren't interested in raiding above their own 
level. We're going through the same thing on my server - most of the 
lower-end guilds approached don't want to lose their name and don't want to 
leave behind all the level 64, plays twice per month and expects loot 
friends in their old guilds.

    That doesn't help you *now*, and if you're recruiting enough people the 
15% rule still leaves a lot of people outside the zone. We've had no more 
than 42, with recruits and bots, on in the past week to week and a half - 
more than six of those people are unflagged for Time/Qvic.

    Reasons to do Time:

(1) Breadth of drops. Can fill a weak slot no matter the class/slot.
(2) Unique effects. Almost no clickable buffs in Qvic, haste wru, several 
foci missing in Qvic.
(3) Number of drops. A day in Qvic/Txevu nets you many fewer items than a 
day in Time.
(4) Competition. It's much easier to schedule a day in Time than it is a day 
in Txevu/Qvic with everything up, especially with an off-hours guild hitting 
the same targets (for us, Australians).
(5) Lack of competition for the recruits. When we go to Time, the recruits 
gets everything through phase 3, almost everything in phase 4, and much of 
the stuff from phase 5. They even have a shot at Quarm loot, depending on 
the drops. When we go to Qvic, some items are snapped up by regular guild 
members who haven't got a full suit yet (I just picked up my final piece, 
helm, over the weekend). In Txevu, all but the worst drops are picked up by 
established guild members. You aren't gearing your recruits by going there, 
you're gearing your regular guild members.

    Riftseeker's takes a serious group for most people. You can tank stuff 
there, but look at yourself - you're in the top five serverwide for HPs. You 
have more HPs than any non-uberguild warrior on my server. He's not going to 
get a pickup group that can handle that zone. Which is too bad - above and 
beyond the spells, the augments are the real reason to go there.

    They don't lack substance, though. I've read spoilers for both games, 
and they sound very in-depth, with a ton of content. I think the thrill will 
fade from WoW before EQ2, just because of how quickly people can level in 
WoW, but by the time people decide to come back there won't be anything to 
come back to.
