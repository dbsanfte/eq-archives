Id either go for eq1 or wait till wow, probably the latter.
Im not convinced that eq2 will be a success. I think most people will either
stay with eq1, or leave Sony at first oportunity.
My beef is the underhanded tricks sony pulls to get us to buy more
expansions (nodrop spells, raids, maps). Id have bought the expansions
anyway for content, so all they have done is hurt their own reputation. I
intend to stay away from future sony products because of that.
