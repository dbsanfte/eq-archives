Once you get a bit higher in levels you can cast Elemental Maelstorm (does
250 dmg initiallly then dots for another 350 or 400 dmg)  I use it all the
time at the beginning of a fight, it seldom draws the agro but I am doing
dmg. I wait until the mob is around 45 % health before I start nuking. But
it depends on what type of tanks I am grouped with also.  Use your damage
shields all the time on the tanks that way you are doing dmg everytime the
mob hits your tank (never DS the people that aren't supposed to have the
agro btw).
