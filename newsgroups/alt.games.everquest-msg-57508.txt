True that no one in here has a direct say in the company that makes the
game. One of the main reasons is, like myself players should send in emails
asking them to try and test the patches a little better in the future. That
maybe why people "scream and moan" in here about it.

I am sure Verant does not really want to look incompetent but it happens.
