If you plan on persuing the shawl quests, you will either have to learn
quite a few tradeskills to a pretty decent level, or be prepared to collect
the needed items for many attempts, or, quite possibly, both.

My understanding is that the smithed version of the thread no longer can be
made.  The item made this way is a spool that is used strictly for the
POTC/Earring quest.  The thread needed for shawl 6 can only be made by
collecting all the pain in the butt drops, and praying that the RNG doesn't
bite you in the behind.
