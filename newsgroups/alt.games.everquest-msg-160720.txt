Without the zonefile you'd just appear into... well, a nothingness
most likely, and fall to your death. And spend days trying to get help
from a GM, since its likely your corpse will need to be cloned in
another zone.

It's not something you want to try.

I got the expansion bug once. You *could* have zoned into PoP zones. I
was able to zone into luclin zones. The thing was, I *did* have Luclin
files on my computer because my other account was properly enabled. So
for a while the account that wasn't enabled was able to get into
luclin and run around. It didn't last too long, though.
