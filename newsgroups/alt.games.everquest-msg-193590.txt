Well, Solstice Earrings are quested, so we aren't looking at a limited
resource.

Other than that, well, the poster you are responding to did
specifically mention bard only FT items, presumably recognizing that
you'd give all/all FT to pretty much any other mana chewer first.

After all, the only real use a bard has for mana is charms, and they
aren't all that important for a group bard (I use them as my primary
form of crowd control in many groups and -still- never go under 80%)
so its unlikely that a group or raid is going to award one to a
bard... unless its a bard only item, then there's no choice.

On the other hand, for a bard who uses charm as his principle means of
soloing exp killing, an increase in mana regen could be very
significant.  Like casters with KEI versus nothing levels of
significant.  Like paladins with DW helm level of significance.
Drastic reduction in sitting around doing nothing time... would sure
seem worth throwing a few Kpp at if you happen to have it lying
around.
