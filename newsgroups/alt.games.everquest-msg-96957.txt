 Yes sir, I agree with you also. I have been known to cuss them once or
twice but they do have there benifits. I've used them just to explore other
areas or work on skills that have fell behind or other things. There's alot
of other things out there to worry about and really wish this wasn't one of
them. These levels can make or break a person, if you get thru them usually
they person is going to stick with character.
