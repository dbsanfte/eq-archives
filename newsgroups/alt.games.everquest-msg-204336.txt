As I roll closer and closer to the levels with which I could acquire my
epics I was wondering about something.  The secondary claw has a haste on it
of 40%.  My question is, is this an item haste or spell haste.  I know it's
not a clicky item but worn, but just wondering how it works out.  I have
SCHW's right now as my haste item and wondering if I should pay the money to
update them or simply wait for my epic.  If it is item haste than there is
no need for a better haste item till then since it will go defunct on me by
then.  If it is spell haste than a better haste item will do me better into
the later levels as well.

Oh and if the answer IS to get a better haste item, what would be your
recommendations considering around 20-30kpp of cash to spend.

Second question, my equipment is this:

Yes, I know I'm twinked like crazy, been wearing most of this since level 10
or so, but any suggestions for better items again in the 20-30kpp range?

When I hit 46 I'll be equipping a Ceramic Shield of Valor and when I hit 51,
replacing the Stave of Shielding with a Club of the Ice Ocean.  I don't tend
to pet cleric very much and actually run into combat, so the low wisdom has
thus far not been a concern.  Would like a slightly higher dex for the
procs, but don't want to sacrifice my STR/STA right now.

Thanks for the help.
