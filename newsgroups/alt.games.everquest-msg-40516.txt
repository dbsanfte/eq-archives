Can one explain the damage caps (an how damage is calculated ... an URL
also would be fine)? I know there is one at level 20 ... is there one
at lvl 10, too? I got a STR of about 110, and a black alloy sword (1HS).
I seem to cap at 20 or 21 below level 10. I expected it to go over 20
at level 10, but it didn't. I have to try what happens hwen using a BABS
when I get one, though. Is 21 just my limit with the 1HS sword, or is there
no cap at lvl 10?
