From the shadows, the mysterious jennaii@aol.comnojunk (Jennaii) (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

The druid or wizard of course makes the final call since it's their
spell. The group leader should be the one to call for it though.

However, what's the point of evaccing from a ldon mission when you
already have a cleric anyways? I agree with the one guy who was mad.
If you still had a shot of taking the boss out (and you must have had
at least a slim chance if druid had evac mana left) then who cares
about a tiny amount of lost experience if it fails (or even if it
succeeds!)? You get it back in a few minutes of LDoN killing anyways.

The point of evaccing is either to avoid a disastrous CR or to avoid
major exp loss. You obviously had a cleric so there could be no major
exp loss. There's no such thing as CR with LDoN, theres neither
respawn nor any possibility of losing corpse. The only reason to evac
in ldon is to avoid bothering with a blown pull (and you would use
succor and run right back), and that wasn't what was happening here
since you didn't have time to try again anyways. I'd probably have
been annoyed too.
