I currently play Ultima Online and was wondering how easy Everquest is
compared to UO.  I say this as I can do near enough everything in UO
with the mouse, what is the control system in Everquest like?  Can it
all be controlled via the mouse?  I hate keyboard based games hence I
dont play First Person shooters.  IfI can play via the moise I may
give thisa go.

thanks

Darren
