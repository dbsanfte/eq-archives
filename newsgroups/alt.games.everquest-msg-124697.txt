Positioning for one... an old guild on Prexus used to call it 'PRAM' -
Position range agro management... heh.

Closeness to the mob is one of the biggest single factors in getting/not
getting agro.

Possibly luck too?   The dot hit one of them and he low-hp agrod?  He
pressed auto attack too soon (you have to let the warrior build considerable
agro before anybody else presses attack)

Theres always bizare things on big mobs too.. normally (read every single
time I fight him) the Itraer Vius blinds/dots me and I FD a few times per
fight, to stay off the rampage list.

We killed him the weekend, I didn't FD a single time. For the first time
ever, he didn't dot me, he didn't blind me, he didn't rampage me, he didn't
even hit me once.

A monk in my group FD'd at half way or so (not wanting to get on the rampage
list), from the moment he FD'd, he immediatly got on the rampage list lol

If you get agro (and really cant be dealing with getting it) Fding at say,
70%, 50% and 20% (only for a split second, mind) usually helps a lot.

Turning attack off for a second every now and then works well too.
