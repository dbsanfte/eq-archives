Well, maybe it's different on different servers, but just out of
curiosity, I shouted, "Need a port to DL - paying 15pp", last night
for an hour or so. I needed to get there eventually, but was
buying/selling in NFP and was in no hurry. No luck. Tried for another
hour this morning. No luck. Changed it to, "...- paying 20pp", and had
a port in like 30 seconds.

FWIW.
