That was me I believe. It is pretty much done, but I still need to get some 
information about some of the monk and rogue abilities. That is about all 
that is left (other than, perhaps, some sort of sanity check on what 
commands you can assign to keys at the same time, ie. not allow monk 
commands if any paladin commands are already assigned). If you want to give 
it a try it can be downloaded from my website at
