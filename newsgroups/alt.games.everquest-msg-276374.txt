I can't answer it about EQ1, but I can answer what there is to do in
EQ2.  I guess that makes this slightly off-topic :P

There are a bunch of level 50 raids in the game already.  I know Ant,
TS, Zek, Feer, CL, PF, CT, and LS all have level 50 raid instances, and
I'm pretty sure I missed some.  Some zones have level 50 raids that are
not instanced, so you race against other guilds to get them.  Even if
you are not in a raiding guild, there maybe options open to you for
raiding.  There is an alliance on our server that is a pseudo-guild
made up of players from a bunch of different guilds that raid together.

You can hit level 50 in tradeskilling.  I know a lot of people that
tried that, and then realized it really wasn't for them and found other
things to do.

With the new mentoring system, you can go back and mentor lower levels
and experience those zones all over again.  You can also get quest
starters when you mentor others.

Speaking of quests, they do not gray out now.  You can finish any
quests in your journal that you haven't bothered to finish by then.  At
level 50, I am just now starting the PGT and Manastone quests.

You can also start up an alt.  They are going to be increasing the
number of character slots up to 6 or 10 (for regular and All Access),
which gives you some room for experimenting.  You can use that as an
opportunity to fill out roles in your guild that they are deficient in.
 I know of three people who started Bard alts for something to do
between raids, and their guilds are short of them.

Personally, I've been helping people with Heritages, completing my
Heritages and Hallmarks (To Speak as a Dragon is going down next), and
mentoring people.  I haven't found a shortage of things to do yet,
especially with being able to effectively pick your level by mentoring.
