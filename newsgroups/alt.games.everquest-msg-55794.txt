    But you can understand why someone would do it. Did you hear what the
Overlord dropped? AC 20 10 to all saves monk tunic. You have a monk, you
know how obscenely good that is - you'd wear that until you got a Fungi, and
would still use it on raids. Do you blame any monk who knew that if he
didn't drop the overlord NOW, that someone else would?
