He's not normally by the zone in to the bazaar unless he gets pulled there.

But for an enchanter- you should have enough spells to buy ANYWHERE in the
bazaar- my 16 enchanter does. Illusion their race, then cast Alliance on the
merchant you want to deal with.

Or go chat with Trade Commissioner Henry. Bind by him. Just go invis through
Echo Caverns to get to Fungus, where you are perfectly safe. Do his quest
about 4 or 5 times, and wear the jewelry he gives you.
