I'm level 41 and am there because for awhile I routinely teamed with a
Cleric who liked to go there.  Something about shouting cleric and bard LFG
that seemed to get us quick groups.  I've since made a baby necro and got
side-tracked a bit, so my cleric friend is now several levels over me and we
don't group much.  Now I'm at a loss of where to go due to inexperience.

Everytime I go to GD I have trouble finding a group.  Finding a good one
seems a little harder.  There's always some yahoo that wants to pull trains
that enjoy punching the bard 1st upon entering the fray.

1/2 elf.  Does that have anything to do with my animation issues?  j/k.
