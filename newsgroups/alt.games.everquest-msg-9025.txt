I've begun killfiling everyone who is off topic.

There is alt.flame for those of you who wish to post each others names,
addresses, and past Usenet history.  According to Mindspring it's all legal
and okay, you can even spend time asking each other to kill yourselves,
that's okay too.

Just stop doing it here.
