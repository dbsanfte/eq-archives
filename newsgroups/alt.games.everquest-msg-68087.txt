No, it doesn't nerf the real time.  I always use the time command, and I 
found this nerf within minutes of making my Cat.  Chuckled, then wondered 
what the Hell they were thinking as I applied logic to the situation.  
Then, I realized that logic isn't what a lot of things in this game are 
based one, and I moved on.
