Subject: Problem with GeForce video card

OK, I finally upgraded my video card. I just got an NVidia GeForce 2 MX 400. It
seems to work fine for everything except for EQ. That's why I got the card..
ahh the bitter irony of it all...

Anyway, when I sign on to EQ, everything is fine thorugh the sign in prcess.
But when I get to the part where the world is loading, the monitor goes black.
I hear the music but don't see anything. Then I get to the character selection
screen. Of course the only way I can tell that is by the music. I get something
on the monitor then, but it is nothing but a bunch of green and black dots in a
repeating squiggly pattern. Interesting to look at, but totally useless for
playing the game.

As far as I know I have the latest driver for the card. Any help would be
greatly appreciated.
