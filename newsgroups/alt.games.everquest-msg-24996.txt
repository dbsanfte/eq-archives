Fine steel weapons drop from the higher levels killing Frost Giants
and Icy Orc.  They probably don't want to leave the camp to sell the
fine steel.  They get about 5pp per weapon selling them to a merchant.
Offer to buy a fine steel spear and/or morningstar for 5pp.  Be
polite.  They will likely jump at it and offer you 200 gold for 13
platinim and a stack of rations.   They may even give a weapon to you
for asking nicely.
