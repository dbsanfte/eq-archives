...broken record.  I have demonstrated how lies can keep a market
inflated and people employed longer than would happen if all
information were public.  It leads, of course, to a steeper downfall
for everyone when the truth does come out.

Consumer confidence dropped quite a bit before Clinton left office,
coinciding with the huge clide the NASDAQ started in early, 2000.

So do the profits of a pyramid scheme, until it too topples.

Why does it always end up back to this?  When asked for evidence that
a President 'caused' a good economy or did something to destroy it,
the argument finally turns to "he is responsible because he is in
charge".  Well guess what?  The idea that a President is held
responsible by people for the economy does not prove that his actions
affected it positively or negatively.

Is launching missiles at a nation an act of war or not?

Oh really?  Since we were discussing Iraq, is that an admission that
Iraq harbored terrorists in 1998?

Seems like they spent an awfully long time designing a soccer ball.

The UN...which almost put Iraq in charge of its disarmament committee,
and which did put the Sudan in charge of its Human Rights committee. 
Which makes no attempt to hide the fact that it assigns and strips
memberships and powers from countries based on politics, rather than
the goals of those committees.

Yes, in France, a country that opposed the US's membership in the
Human Rights Commission in 2001, because a Republican was president
and because the US didn't sign the Kyoto Treaty.  Yes they were our
friends until Bush pished for war in Iraq.

The truth is that those 'allies' which supposedly turned enemy did so
because they don't like our _internal_ politics.  They don't like a
ban on partial birth abortion.  They don't like tax cuts.  They don't
like Republicans.

As for France opposing war in Iraq, they don't want the US making war
on their trading partners now do they?

And Clinton did a wonderful job of this.  Oh wait, no he didn't.  He
never even asked.

Of for God's sake.  I'm arguing with a conspiracy nutcase.

Forget it, I'm not wasting any more time on you.
