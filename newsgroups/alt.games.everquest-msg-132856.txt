My kids at 2 yrs old knew they coudl ask me about anything, and they'd get
an actual answer.  At 2 they both understood the concept of disease and
individuals with disease.  One of them was reading at a 4th grade level at
age 4 -- this summer at age 13 he's been reading the works of Stephen
Hawking (and understanding it fully).

I'm not being PC at all -- I'm simply stating that the best developmental
approach for young children is to let them feel valued, and the best
educational approach is to encourage questions and give them answers to
their questions.
