With the new alternate abilities once your above lvl 51 u can take more than
one skill above 200...the most profitable to me seems to have been
smithing....geerlok stuff is tinkered...go to the bazaar and do a search for
geerlok you should see all you wanted to every buy for sale there as any
gnome can tinker and it's not that hard of a skill to get up.
