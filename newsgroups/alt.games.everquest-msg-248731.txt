Why?

I don't disagree really, but I'm not sure I agree either.

Leveling in EQ is fun. When someone in my group "pings" they usually
get a half-hearted "wtg" or whatever, but when you "ding 65"...
fireworks go off, people send you tells, friends beg for a loan...
well, ok that last one kinda sucks ;-)

Seriously, the only thing that bothers me is the way 65 happened.
Getting from 60 to 65 was a joke. I took a long time, but only because
I was doing AA at the same time. Some people were 65 within the WEEK
that the expansion came out.

Hopefully SOE has learned their lesson and getting to 70 will take us
all a good long time and represent a huge achievement that we'll all
be able to appreciate.
