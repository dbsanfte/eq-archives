I would never deliberately send my group into a sure wipe... but I'll 
happily take them into situations where a wipe is very real possibility. 
(My groups are aware of this in advance)

When all is said and done... really what's the big deal about getting 
wiped?

I wipe out regularly... In fact if a play session goes without a 
near-wipe, then I figure we weren't doing anything terribly interesting ;)

More often then not, its a calculated risk when we engage a mob... 
sometimes it just isn't doable. Sometimes we surprise ourselves... (e.g. 
we took the Owlbear champ in the Hollowshade Moor war the other day with 
a bard, pali, and BL 39th level and really without knowing what we were 
getting into... (found out *during* the fight that it wasn't mezzable, 
snareable, charmable, or lullable... several wasted spell gems, 
completely wrong tactics, several seconds of getting pounded on as we 
adjusted... ;) and we still won... but it was damned close, required the 
Pali's LoH, and cost the BL  his pet. But we talked about that fight for 
hours afterwards... and the session was an absolute blast.

That makes risking the a wipe more than worthwhile in my eyes. Besides 
its eq, not Diablo2 HardCore... worst case your out an hours worth of 
kills... its not like it makes any lasting or permanent dent in your 
character.
