...yes for armor.  But not for weapons, as you suggest below.

So you have a 1-handed weapon for an SK or Paladin that is 13/27?  Or
is it a 2-handed weapon that is 13/27?  You can pick up knight-class
one-handers with a better ratio than that for a few hundred plat. 
(knights get better ratios on knight-only one-handers because they
can't dual wield...but that means using a one-hander for a non-dual
wielding class)  Meanwhile, you can pick up two-handers with this
ratio for almost nothing.

In general, rangers can equip most two-handers that knights can equip,
and the one-hander discussion is moot.
