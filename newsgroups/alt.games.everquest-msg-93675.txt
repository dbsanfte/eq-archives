HQ *bear* pelts are the valuable ones - they still command 20-30 plat
on Prexus.

HQ cat pelts are, unfortunately for you, fairly common. That's not to
say you won't be able to sell them to a player, but that it may not be
worth your time trying. You might get lucky and find a tailor who
needs lots of them, but I certainly wouldn't expect to get more then
3-5 plat each for them.
