I used to have this type a problem at lot after 4+ hour raids in various
PoP zones, and turning off the "Use advanced lighting" option under
the advanced displays option menu fixed it.  I would also get some weird
clipping effects, too sometimes.  

It reared its head again with PoR, but just in the guild lobby for me,
which is where it sounds like a number of people were having the problem.
Funny thing is, turning that option back on fixed the guild lobby for me.
But SoE must have finally fixed it, since I am no longer having problems
in the lobby with advanced lighting turned off.
