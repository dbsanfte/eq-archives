I log on in the morning pretty often,  but with a relatively short time 
and during that time I'm going to be on and off the machine, not really 
paying a huge amount of attention.

Im making breakfast, putting together some sketches of swords to make, a 
list of other thins that need to get done, getting dressed and so on. 
I'm not ready for a group, I'm not really even ready for content that 
requires effort on my part.

But what I can do is run my character over somewhere nearby where he can 
fight mobs without me having to babysit him much, and loot the bodies 
before they rot.

For me, this spot is "Death Row", or the hall full of Punisher and 
Enforcer mobs on the way to Mavuin, in POJ.

Getting there is simple, the run from Guild Lobby where I've likely 
camped or spent the night is short and has no hazards.  Even inside POJ, 
there are no hazards, nothing aggros on the route down there until I hit 
the first enforcer, which comes single and is part of the target set I'm 
looking for.

These mobs come in pairs, are static spawns, no roamers.  I can fight 
two at once without looking at the screen; if it comes down to it my DS 
plus my pet will finish off the add before I die.  But if I get a second 
to make sure I'm facing the add and hit my attack button again, I'll end 
the fight at near 100% HP due to my multiple lifetap procs.

I'm sitting on horseback, so if I'm down any mana or hp, I don't have to 
do anything in particular to fix it, just standing there when the fight 
ends allows me to regen back up to full.

Bodies that have something on them last plenty of time for me to get 
around to looting them, the ones that didn't do fade fast but what do I 
care, saves the trouble.

For this minimal effort, I'm killing half green and half grey mobs, the 
exp is pretty bad, perhaps a yellow AA per two hours.  But I'm also 
raking in three types of diamonds, and assorted other loot which adds up 
to a couple Kpp per hour.

Compare this to the old standby, Hill Giants in RM.  There, I have to 
continually run around looking for the next mob to kill, and worry about 
  hunting them down when they turn to run.  If I don't kill off the PH 
mobs, the money sucks.  If I do, thats even more bother, although having 
my pet do it for me does simplify it.  Although my potential hourly 
would be higher there, I only really get that if I put solid effort 
in... not the leisurely inattentive morning that I can spend in Death Row.

And, as a bonus, I generally pick up an EP or two which lower level 
friends appreciate.

The downside of this is, I've done this hall so many times, on so many 
characters, because of just these factors, that its really gotten a bit 
old.  I'm not getting any useful faction or crystals or spells or loot I 
can use other than cash (which, actually, I turn into crystals to buy 
DON gear with)

So if anyone wants to part with their lazy farming spots, hey, its not 
like this is a busy forum, lets hear it!
