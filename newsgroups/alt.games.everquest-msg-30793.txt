I found it a hell of a lot of fun to charm them. No shit, you charm one
greenie griffawn and you will slaughter about 5 blue cons with it.

You have few ways of getting them. I like to follow one at a safe distance
and when it gets next to something I want dead, I charm it. If the charm
doesn't stick, with SoW I just counted to 25 and slammed on the brakes to
try another charm.

You can also open up with snare so you have more time to cast. The 25 count
thing you see [out of range, out of range, begin casting, success/failure,
get thumped on failure]. You can just avoid being thumped if you hit your
numlock key to bolt. Alternatively you can just click a spell icon while
running until you get "out of range", then stop and cast for real.

I would guess you spend about 20 minutes an hour walking behind them waiting
for them to get close to something worth killing. 20 minutes an hour running
from them when charm breaks. 20 minutes of mass destruction when charm holds
for 2-3 minutes on 4-6. Compared to 40 minutes of looking at your spellbook
an hour, it is a little more exciting.

I got kind of lazy and would just drag some of them that lost charm over
guards when I got too low on mana: Much quicker then zoning.

I don't think it is a smart or a good technique, just a blast. I am wishing
every zone had animals in it equvalent to the monster levels.
