That would be handy if you lived in a house and all.  Get into
your pickup truck and head three states over to live in a medival
hovel for 6 weeks at a time, then move to another, or take a van
and drive thru mexico for a winter, or spend time living in the
same van in a campground but also using it as transportation (so
if you aren't home, neither is the TV/VCR)... well us nomads
don't have such options.   

Nowadays I own a house and when I'm away its in a building with
electric and my little DirecTV dish hidden in a fake chimney...
but I'm not really going to work that hard to keep up with a
serial show even so, 90% of the time I have Comedy Central (*turn
it on, leave it on*) playing and I'm busily ignoring it.
