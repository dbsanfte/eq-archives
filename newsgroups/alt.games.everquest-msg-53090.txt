Are there any sites that spell out where you're kos when you start based on
race, class and religion?  I know that as soon as you get out in the world
and start killing stuff it will change, but I was wondering what a baseline
might be.

I have an Erudite Necro that I play occassionally.  He's almost level 8 and
I was wondering where I could bank and not be killed by guards.  The only
factions I've gotten are from killing kobolds.  Last time I checked I was
apprehensive to the High Guard in erudin and amiable in Paineel.  I've never
actually entered Erudin as I wasn't sure about the other guilds.

Thanks,

Lewis
