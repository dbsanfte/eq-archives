Well, dontcha know that even if Tunare turned out to be Vegan, I could see
her popping into RunnyEye to eat her own bodyweight in Sporali...how else
would she maintain her six-pack :-)

But on a Roleplay sort of slant, something that I did not expect happened to
my would-be adventurer - a helf-elven Paladin of Tunare.  After getting to
11th Level in and around GFAY, a friend asked if I wanted to go try Runnyeye
with his halfling cleric. He logs in his druid and ports us to NK.  I'm
standing there trying to get my bearings when I hear 'Paladins like you
really set me off' (paraphrasing...can't recall the exact phrase).  Now, my
RP play-mind wanted to turn and ask "Why, brother?  Surely Tunare's power is
great enough to encompass a broad aspect of her worship;  from druids and
rangers caring for her charges in the wild to Paladins metting out her truth
in the built-up regions."  My gamer-mind said "I'm dead.", and that side
proved to be right.
I didn't stop to ask then, but does anyone know what I could have done
(having never left BB-GFAY-CB-FEL before) by 11th level to earn the ire of
my fellow Tunare followers in NK?
