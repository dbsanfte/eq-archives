If you don't want to take the time out to answer my questions, then don't.
Noone is twisting your arm.  Because my question included some very specific
information about equipment I have, I thought I would get a better answer
here than I would trying to sift through pages and pages of irrelevant
information.  What you have to understand, is that for someone who has just
begun playing there is a lot to learn.  Class specific information is only
one thing I have been trying to figure out.  I have spent a lot of time
online copying maps, looking for quests, looking up items and creatures,
trying to understand the various skills etc...

I was unable to find what I was looking for at that web site.  Perhaps it is
there, but I could not find it.

I am grateful for the help I have received here and within the game, and it
is one of the reasons I find the game to be so much fun.  Be aware also,
that I have spent many hours helping others in an effort to return the
favors ranted to me.

I am sorry that you feel I have wasted your time.  Please do not put
yourself out any further on my behalf.
