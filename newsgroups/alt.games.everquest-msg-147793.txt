My hazy memory of this subject recalls that while it would be great, someone
brought up the idea of multiple recipes using similar ingredients that would
make it functionally impossible for the program to determine what the
trade-skiller wanted.
Two silk threads make a band-aid
Three silk threads make a cord.
So if you put 18 silk threads into a sewing kit and hit combine, what would
it return?

I agree, it'd be nice, but its probably not gonna happen.
