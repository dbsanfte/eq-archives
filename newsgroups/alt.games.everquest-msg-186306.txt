 the nonsense that Clinton spoon fed you.  Peace under Clinton?  Give
>me a break.  Ever heard of Bosnia, Serbia, Mogadishu, Somolia? 

Well, just for starters, the situations you mention were undwerway when 
Clinton was elected. Mogadishu is Somalia and the relief effort -- it was not 
a war -- was in motion before Clinton came in. It went bad from the start and 
it was Clinton who shut it down.  As for Bosnia, Serbia, et al.  One man alone 
was responsible for the carnage throughout the Balkans and it wasn't Clinton 
or even Bush I. It was Milosevich. Europe should have stopped him. He was not 
stopped until after the worst massacre in Europe since WWII and the ethnic 
cleansing of Kosovo and many other places. The Kosovo action was a NATO 
action, long overdue. Hussein is not remotely the monster that Milosevich was. 
 Western inaction in Bosnia is a stain on the West's escutcheon. But an 
unprovoked attack on Iraq of the scale intended will be an atrocity of 
monstrous proportions from which the reputattions of the US and UK will never 
recover.
