Well, I'm sure they mean it to be "dynamic content" but in reality, there
have only been a few successes and most of the others were... painful.

In general, usually a GM event works this way... some zone that is level
appropriate for 5-18th level characters (think WC, NRO, Oasis, qeynos hills)
is flooded with mobs, 10-15 levels higher than normal.. Those mobs slaughter
all the normal players in that zone... cries go out for help. Higher level
players show up, kill the greenies, pick over the nice loot and leave.

14 groups in 20 will be too low, and left to die at the hands of the mobs. 5
groups show up and are way too high, kill everything looking for drops,
possibly passing out what they can't use or don't want. One group in 20 will
be level appropriate for the event and they *might* get xp and some decent
no drop loot. 10 groups in 20 will be too low, and left to die.

Jadedness aside, the best event I've been a part of was the Halloween event.
I was level appropriate for a couple of zones, and killed some mobs I got XP
for and got a couple of nice items. I enjoyed it very much.

Another hallmark of the Halloween events was that there were mobs of
different levels around, so you could eventually find the zone that had mobs
you could kill :)

Downside to this of course was that if you were a non-porting class, it was
hard to arrive at a zone in time for the event. Having them restart every
couple of hours was what made the Halloween events nice. If you heard of an
event for your level, there was a real chance you could make it to the zone
and even if you missed *this* one, you could stick around for the next time.

My major complaint as a higher level porting class for most events was this:
by the time I heard of an event, found out what level it was for, and
arrived, the event was over, never to happen again... what this equates to
is pure luck... if you *happen* to be standing in that zone... and *happen*
to be the right level... you can participate, otherwise you would die to the
event, get no XP or items, or arrive too late.

Looking over my post I see it really revolves around XP and loot.. and not a
RP sense of the events. Let me just say this, If you are too low for an
event, it isn't *fun* to die to the event. If you are too high for the event
it isn't *fun* to slaughter greenies (what glory can be found in killing
creatures that are no match for you?).

Successful events in my book need a few things... they need to last long
enough for me to participate... they need to provide a challenge that *is*
surmountable. There is no *fun* in being slaughtered by an *invulnerable*
monster... at any level. Lastly, they need to provide a reward for the
participants. Whether this is XP, Loot, Glory, a feeling you helped in the
conclusion... whatever it is, you need to walk away thinking "wow, I'm glad
I was here to see this".
