Aha! Thank you.  I had wondered if it was that issue.  People kept saying
get fast weapons, and I kept thinking but surely it's the ratio that
matters most.  Over 5 minutes, the better ratio weapon (assuming the same
skill levels) generate more damage, and therefore, more overall hate.

Yep, also exactly what I've experienced.  Good, so I'm not crazy.  Hate
appears to relate to the damage, and the better the ratio the better that
element of hate is.  But, aggro recovery when lost relies on causing damage
as quickly as possible (and also as much as possible), and hence may be
more difficult with a weapon which is slower, even if the ratio is better.

I would love to have a more technical understanding of how hate is modelled
and managed, but on the other hand it might spoil it for me to know too
much.
