It's never messed mine up.  A proper keyboard
sends a numpad 0-9 keydown/keyup message regardless
of the Numlock status.  I have noticed that some 
USB keyboards (a logitech one in particular) send the
number/arrow keydown/up messages instead (depending
on whether Numlock is on or off) as though you were
using the T arrowpad or the numbers across the top.
