You get more XP in the end, likely, as someone said.  You kill up to 50%
more mobs as in slaughter, *but* those mobs are easier kills.  I can do a
collect with only debuffing here and there and the stuff dies to fast to
bother with my Enchanter DoTs, but if we want to make time in a slaughter,
it helps to debuff and/or DoT.

That said, collections are not my favorite, and if I'm concerned about
getting a success, I'll only take them if they're 26 items or more.  I've
never failed a high-number collection; I've never passed a low-number
collection.
