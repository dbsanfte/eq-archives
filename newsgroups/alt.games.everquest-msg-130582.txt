If you wanna get you faction up, it's fairly easy to do by
slaughtering bandits in NK, or even better, SK.  From SK you can kill
the bandits by the water and still run over to the centaurs to sell
what bronze weapons they drop.  And a couple hours of killing will get
your faction up so you're at least not KOS.

This is how I did it with my Troll warrior.
