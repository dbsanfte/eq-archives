A couple of things you are not taking into consideration..

1. Monk Dual Wield will be higher at all levels until it caps.
(7*level+5 if memory servers)
2. Post 50 monks have a different (and higher) melee damage table than
other classes.

Rogues will out-damage a monk (by obscene amounts) if they can stay
behind a mob. Monks are called the "ltimate damage dealer", because
they are 100% effective no matter how they face the mob.

Not counting twinking, a monk will dish out more damage than any other
melee class (except for backstabbing rogues) of equal level and equal
equipment.
