I still haven't found the time to take my necro up to the moon yet. But
at least one person here, and a couple of other references, have
mentioned that the "research only" spells are all for sale on vendors in
Luclin. Could this be true? I mean, ok, easier for me since I still have
one spell left that I didn't have enough words to create (Breath of the
Dead) but if this is so, then what's the point of having research in the
game at all? Why bother? Who's going to hunt all over the world for
those stupid words, and risk losing them on a "poof" in your book of
dark bindings to get spells we *really* need badly, when you can just
pop on up to the shop on Luclin and get them?

Can anyone verify this that's already been spell shopping up there?
