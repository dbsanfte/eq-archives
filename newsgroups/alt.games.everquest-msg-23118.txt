Aside from all the high-tech solutions from the others I have a slightly
other solution.
With Win2k you can use multiple IP addresses for a single connection.
I did it this way:

- Place a hub and connect your modem and your pc to it (normally it goes
directly to your pc)

- Use the LAN connection to make contact with the modem in the normal way by
setting the LAN-connection's IP to the one needed for his internet
connection.

- Set the whole connection right so you have a internet-connection like you
want it. After that disconnect the connection.

- Now go to the internet-connection-link in "Network and dial-up
connections" and right-click it. the most right tab is the sharing tab.
Enable the ICS setting. This will overwrite your LAN-IP and set it to
192.168.0.1 thereby destroying your connection with your modem if you wanted
to connect right now.

- Now rightclick the LAN-connection in the same folder and go to the
IP-properties again. When there you should see the 192.168.0.1. At the
right-bottom is an "Advanced..." tab. Go there.

- Now you can add an additional ip-address. Fill your Modem/Internet IP here
and add it.

- Fire your internet connection up again. It should work now and ICS
activated on it.

This procedure has worked like a charm for me. The problem is that my
adsl-modem needed a certain address and ICS needs another, both on the same
connection. Setting things up they need the primary IP be that certain
address, but after that both can make do with a secondary or such.

This only works for Windows 2000 as far as I know, because 98/ME/NT all
don't support multiple IP-addresses on the same connection (or at least not
this easy configurable).
