Just bought Everquest trilogy (original with 2xpacs), never played
before, tried to register a new account, filled out all the info
correctly; keeps getting hung up on the 'verifying registration info'
screen. I read on the station help page that this may be due to my
cable modem and network config. file. Anybody have this happen to
them? How to fix?

Regards,
