This is the way that I have got my sense heading maxed out on all my char's
also. Only one change I would make is, put the sense heading to the left or
right turn key.  reason for this is when you are running forward you don't
actually hit the forward key that much.. but you can remember to just keep
"tapping" your left or right key.. my druid had her forage on one and sense
heading on other.. these were always maxed at every level=)
