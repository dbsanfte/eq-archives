No, I'm criticizing a service industry for over-saturating us with a
service. It's kinda like Food World stocking their shelves full of
filet mignon. Yeah, customers love the high-quality beef cuts, but
over doing it means a LOT of resources are being wasted on something
that they're not even going to sell 1/4 of their inventory of.
Resources that could be spent on offering other things that the
customers like as well.

Point is, I know that what happened is a horrible tragedy, and that we
should all take lessons from it (and most of us have). I don't need
12-hour introspectives on every channel on TV to remind me of it. Like
I said before, you can pay respect without having to flood the media
with it. It's more tasteful that way, too.
