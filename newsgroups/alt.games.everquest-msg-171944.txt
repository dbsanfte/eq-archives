I never had that problem.  Oh wait, I forgot, I hardly bothered grouping other than with
friends before level 52.

I play cantata in between pulls, and sometimes during them (instrument juggle lute of the
jharin isn't hard, because its primary slot).  I can and have played the manasong/amp/cantata
special blend... but not for people I dont' know well.  Its waaaaay too much work, frankly.

If anyone suggested that I play manasong only in an exp or loot group, there's a good chance
I'd disband.  For most groups, most strategies, this would be boneheaded orders, and it would
certainly be less than amusing.    I have been known to put autofollow on the cleric, slap
manasong (or cantata) on and go take a shower.... but again, thats playing with friends, in a
situation where optimal play wasn't demanded, and noone minded missing out on a good deal of
efficiency and having me basically suck up exp doing less than half my job.
