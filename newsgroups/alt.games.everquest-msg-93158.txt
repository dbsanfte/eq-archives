Not a mistake you choose him for perfectly  valid reasons.

Not that much of a mistake if you got that much fun and enjoyment out of
playing him this long.

Nope, you can still tailor and smith. Yes you can't make cultural stuff but by
the time your of an appropriate skill level to make cultural there is equally
good armor to make that is unversally wearable by all.

Cultural armour is nice and there are some piecs worth making but "it ain't all
that".

Pottery is a nice easy skill to get up. Cost me about 25PP to get to 115. At
your level sand giants should be pretty easy to kill to get sand of ro from and
therefore make wisdom idols (range slot) worth about 200pp on my server, nice
'alternative income' when you can't find something to wack.

>Baking is perfect for druids and
>Brewing isn't bad either.

Both of these are very easy to get to approx 140's. With all that foraged stuff
your costs are a lot lower than non-forageable classes. Okay you will probably
never make much of a profit with these two but if your in tradeskills to make a
decent profit you have definately been meleeing a bit too long.

Not sure about the tanking bit but i like the sentiment.
