Sure it does, you just need to limit vcache. With 585 meg ram I have
vcache set to 16 meg. Cacheman shows that I used all of my system ram
during an EQ session and that its back down to like 85 megs of use at
present. At worst  I used 61.4 meg of my 250 meg min max perm virtual
swap. This is with conservative swap usage on also. 512 meg or more
seems to be the sweet spot for EQ.

Vcache or disk cache is mainly of use when many of the same recently
requested files are again requested. So it works well for a file
server serving many of the same files over and over but won't help
much for EQ since it will simply continually be caching new files and
tying up that system memory.

The problem with more than 512 meg ram only happens because the vcache
and AGP apeture size both take up a certain amount of mem addresses
and when the total of both is equal to or greater than 850 meg or so
they can all be used up = crash. So even limiting the vcache to 512
meg prevents that. I found that whatever I limited my vcache to, such
as 100 meg or whatever, EQ caused that much to actually be used yet
ran no better than when limiting it to 16 meg.

If win98/ME/95 simply automatically set vcache depending on your
amount of ram to a conservative amount then this problem would have
never happened and you'd never see people saying they don't handle
more than 512 meg ram well.
