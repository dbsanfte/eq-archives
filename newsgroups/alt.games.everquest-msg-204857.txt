Well its not the buffs that make mobs mad, its the act of buffing.  Bards buff
people every few seconds, while druids do it a couple times an hour at best.

But lets pick the most inoffensive buff, say Charisma.  Now lets take a puller
who brings a mob back to the group.

A) Mob is aggroed by a thrown weapon and noone does anything, including bard not
singing anything.  When puller stops at the group, mob goes for him no questions
asked... unless someone is sitting perhaps.

B) OK, same situation only mob was prox aggroed.  Now mob will almost certainly
peel off on anyone who is sitting, and might go for anyone in the way,
particularly if lower level than the puller.

C) OK, now the puller is a monk, and FD's before mob gets in range of party.
Mob just walks off.

D) Same deal but FD happens too close, mob now goes for whoever is closest or
perhaps lowest level or sitting or.. well its hard to tell what its going to do.

E) OK, now I cast Charisma on the puller before we engage the mob.  He's not
FD'd yet, but since he only prox pulled I'm actually now higher on the hate list
than he is

F) Let the puller use something better than prox aggro; weapon, spell,
something.  Now the buff might not draw aggro.  Still might though.

G) How about I try buffing and casting heals every 6 seconds instead?  This is
called chain casting, any other class would be laughed out of the group for it.
But its how bards work.  Luckily the actual aggro per buff is about as small as
they get, so if the group has any real aggro built up at all you won't steal
from them... but that prox aggro puller, particularly a FDing one, he's another
case.
