April 8th 2003

    Since the patch this morning I am missing the expansions enabled.
under the server select, Screen. I have all the Expanion's I was just
wondering if they decided to take this out because if you do have all
the Expansions what do you need to see that message. And of course I
am not missing anything like froglok's or Iksar's or Vah Shir's
everything is working well. Just wondering if anybody had any news on
this.
