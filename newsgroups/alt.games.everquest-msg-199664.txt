I have tried EQ on a couple of occasions. For the most part I have
found players ingame very helpful even benevolent.

It is this elietist crap that irritates me to no and and really
detracts from my enjoyment of the game. At least in Ultima Online all
we have to deal with is the Doods and Jerks..... we don't really have
that many snobs like this over there.

Why don;lt you just let people play the game thier way and stop trying
to be their conscience for them?
