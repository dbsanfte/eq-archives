Heh, i didnt have time to play between the 2 patches, so didnt feel the 
XP problems myself, but one of my good RL friends did, and it were close 
to ridiculous.
He had been killing gnolls in Jaggedbine with his 59 rogue and 58 shammy 
(try to look for group with a rogue, before he got 2 accounts so he 
could dualbox, he spend around 2 hours a day LFGing, and around 75% of 
the time he didnt get any groups anyway, people on my server seems to 
have a big problem with rogues, unless they need them to open any doors).
With 59 rogue/58 shammy combo, he could do around 1 blue bub of XP in 2 
hours. Ok XP, but not that great.
After patct that changed XP, he went there again. After killing 40 (yesm 
forty, not four) blue gnolls, he got 1 pixel increase on his 58 shammy, 
no XP increase at all on his rogue. After that he went to ME and killed 
15 umbral toilers, no XP movement on either chars bar.

Im just VERY happy they changed it back, everyone not playing at 
american peak hours would be severely screwed, and everyone who liked to 
solo/due/triple would too.
