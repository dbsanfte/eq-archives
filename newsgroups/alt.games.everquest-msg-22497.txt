 Well I'm not going to get into it with you since you obviously have
your own ideas about how people enjoy this game. Suffice it to say, as I
said before, we have at least 5 level 60 Shamans in our guild and they
are all regularly out on raids. We do all the 'big' raids other than
Sleepers at the moment since we don't have enough keys. We regularly
clear VP, kill Cazic, Zlandicar/Kland and Dain, WW and ToV raids etc...
Other than Yelinak and a lot of the named in ToV I don't think there's a
mob we haven't killed. We are doing the high-end game and we don't
always have enough clerics online to stick one in every group. Anyway,
I'm not saying Shaman are a required class like Clerics but I also think
they are handy to have around and not just for Primal and Focus buffs.
