Being nit-picky I would tell you the word "homosexual" refers to a
medical disorder now removed from the books, or that you should use
"queer" instead of "gay", or that the only correct term is "GLBT"
or....

I am trying to point out your prejudice and bigotry to you.  Guess its
something you don't understand, since "All Americans" are alike in
your "backward social ways."

I can see why you hate "the PC" so much.
