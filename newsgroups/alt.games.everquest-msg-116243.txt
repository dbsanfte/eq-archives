We recently had a case here where Microsoft were demanding a school pay 
for Microsoft licences. The school then agreed, but wanted Windows 3.1 
licenses (since that's the software they were using) but Microsoft said 
they don't sell Windows 3.1 anymore. So either the school had to pay for 
new computer hardware which could run Windows 98, then purchase Windows 
98 licenses or Microsoft would take them to court. The school was then 
offered a Linux solution for free and all of a sudden Microsoft dropped 
their charges (we wouldn't want kids learning how to use a non MS 
operating system now would we?).

Donating to charity is just Bill doing PR work, desperately trying to 
shake off the reputation of being a selfish, ruthless megolomaniac.
