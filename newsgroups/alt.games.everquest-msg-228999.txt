EQ guy says that it does store the mana spent to cast it.  The benefit of
the situation is that all mages get a "baby IRE" because a pet with 1% hp
will still return 75% of the mana cost to cast it.  When I think about this
and the strategy I used soloing through much of the 50's, this would have
been much more valuable.  I didn't canni as much as I sent pet in to fight
and reclaimed whatever was left.  Often I'd get back almost nothing because
pet was close to death.
