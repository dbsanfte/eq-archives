Overkill.   A friend's 51 druid solo'ed the patriarch.   Repeatedly.

He can spawn as any static giant in Dreadlands, not sure about the wanderers.
Best place to camp him is probably the giant fort in the middle of the zone.
Be prepared for a hell of a wait.   I put in about 3 or 4 hours total without
ever seeing him before my friend killed him and gave me the monocole.    The
monocole is also not that common.  It dropped off the third patriarch.
