>What's the cheapest way to get smithing past 188?

Shadowscream. Trivial (around 248) is a bit high at 188 but it is cheap as
chips, just incredibly time consuming farming the bits, especially in
Twilight Sea. If you can get the services of  an AE nuker for Hollowshade
you're laughing, and you can get ft1 for all your twinks off the owlbear
mother when u want a change :)
