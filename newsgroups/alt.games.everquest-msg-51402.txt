You should not. It is not really the roleplaying server at all and I
in fact see less roleplaying on there than on my normal server. What
it really is is "the much harder ruleset and much harder to
communicate on server which is quite a whole quieter than the other
ones." You'd probably be pretty lost there. I went to it for what it
is and therefore have not been disappointed by expecting to see more
roleplaying.

The rules and inability to communicate well on here with other races
make this the hardest non pvp server there is. Don't mistake people
being stifled and not seeing /ooc or /shout channels or being able to
communicate well as you not seeing as much non roleplaying since you
could turn off /ooc and shout on the server you are now and not see
that either. The most roleplaying I usually see on FV is someone
saying:

"paladin of 19 seasons looking for a group"

but I even see that on my regular server. Call it level or seasons or
"goodytwoshoes" its the same damn thing either way and one or the
other certainly does not roleplaying make.
