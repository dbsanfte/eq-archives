And more to the point is the Strat guide in any way offical or accurate
on other points ?
I have heard some very bad things about some of the previous guides and
I can imagine a non sony company trying to get a guide out ASAP and
having to fill in the blanks for spells like this. Something like this :

Manager_1 : SoL is out in a week we need to get the guide to the
printer. What do these spells do ?
Tester_1 : Dunnow, sounds like some sort of int buff
Tester_2 : No effect on Int. I will test a bit.
... 5 mins ...
Tester_2 : Humm I think I could be fizzling a bit less, or maybe less
resists.
Tester_1 : How much ? Did you parse the logs ?
Tester_2 : Yep I did ten casts with out and ten with. It was better with
it.
Tester_1 : How much ?
Tester_2 : Some.
Tester_1 : k, so say 3 levels ?
Tester_2 : Of what ?
Tester_1 : You want to test it again ?
Tester_2 : k, 3 levels.
Tester_1 : So the other one would be what, 6 levels ?
Tester_2 : Sounds good.
Tester_1 : What about trade skills ?
Tester_2 : Does anyone actually do them anymore?
Tesrer_1 : Pah, you can't PL with them, so no.
Tester_2 : So you want to test them ?
Tester_1 : 3 levels you say ?
Tester_2 : yep
Tester_1 : Hey boss we got those spells down. Want to call the printer ?

Just a guess mind.

Jim
