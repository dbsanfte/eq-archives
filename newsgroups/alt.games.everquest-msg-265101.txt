Heh, actually I'd gone back and added the line about KDragon later on so
the complicated by was supposed to be referencing the tech support
queue,

Because there almost certainly is no such form, nor any such option in
their script.  Five to 10 years ago i'd have expected good tech support,
but these days all that seems to exist is minimum wage script readers,
that aren't allowed to deviate from the script at all.

That's kinda the whole point here.   
By design, the "kill stealing" that happens in other games _can't_
happen in CoH since no one "owns" the mob, nor is the experience only
given to the person who killed it.  You always get a share of the exp
proportionate to the damage done, no matter who killed it.

No, it actually does reflect the reality.  
This is the sequence related to us.
1. KDragon gets followed and repeatedly has the "boss" of the groups
fought killed by a second party as soon as KDragon cleared the minions.
2. KDragon petitions
3. GM shows up, KDragon complains about kill stealing, not harassment
4. GM says "you have no reason to petition you always get exp"
5. KDragon immediately logs off and cancels account.

Since the mechanics of the game and policy say there's no such thing as
kill stealing, what we have here is someone throwing a temper tantrum
and quitting because the GM didn't do what they wanted, based on the
information they gave to the GM.

KDragon was being harassed, but did not complain about being harassed.

Now you're just being silly.
One thing is an offense, the other isn't.

To put this in a different light:

Guy follows woman around whistling at her every minute.
Follows her for a long time and many blocks.

Woman complains to a policeman that a guy whistled at her, what's the
cop's reaction going to be?

Right, "So what, whistling isn't against the law."
<Woman immediately storms off in a huff, without trying to explain the
details.>


Woman complains to a policeman that a guy has been following her for 17
blocks and whistling at her all the time, what's the cops reaction going
to be?
Right, the cop is going to deal with the harasser, warning him off or
arresting him if he won't stop.

Whistling isn't a crime, harrassing/stalking someone is.


In COH, harassment of other players is forbidden and gets a warning, a
temp suspension and a banning if continued.

Kill stealing, by the basic mechanics of the game's exp system, doesn't
exist.

If you're going to complain, complain about something that actually
exists if you want to have your complaint taken seriously.
