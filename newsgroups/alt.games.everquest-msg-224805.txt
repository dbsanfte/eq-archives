    When we do Hard adventures, we cross our fingers for a collection. Can
complete a Collect 30 in just under the "you're still resting from your
previous adventure" time, and just like slaughter it doesn't matter which
direction you head so you can clear straight to the nameds. That's with a
charmed friend, mind you - without it's closer to 60 minutes to completion.
