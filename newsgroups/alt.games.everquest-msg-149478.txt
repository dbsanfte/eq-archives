Clerics have several heal lines.

At any given level they have three:

Big Slow Expensive Heal (BS)
Little Fast Cheap Heal (LF)
HP Buff that doubles as a heal (BH)

A fourth line is the Heal Over Time (HOT)
A fifth line is the Group Heal (GH)
and the king of heals is Complete Heal (CH)

At level 60 this would be

BS:Ethereal Remedy (except that it isn't slow)
LF:Remedy
BH:Not Used
HOT:Celestial Elixer
GH: Word of Restoration
CH:CH

GH is used primarily in encounters with AE mobs,
usually none is memmed at all, although velious
quest legs have a handy clicky miniature version
for non critical use.  At lower levels, Heroic Bonds
deserves special mention as a group Buff heal
that can be targetted for use on other groups, no
other group heal is useful on anyone but your own
group.

BS is used in "oops there's no way he's going
to live without this" situations, avoid if at all possible

LF is used in "this should keep him alive long enough
to get things under control" situations

BH... well at lower levels, this line is used where you'd think
BS line would be used, to heal heavily damaged people
who aren't about to die and don't have enough damage to
warrant a CHeal.  Sadly, at 60 this would mean Aego, which
is too expensive both in terms of mana and wasted peridot
to use for this duty.  At lower levels, though, any HP buff up
to and including Heroism works very nicely, cheaper than
the level's BS, just a bit slower, and as a bonus, refreshes the
buff itself.  Side note, see BS above about Heroic Bonds.
BH line also is much lower aggro than any other heal

HOT Celestial Heal and Elixer give more heal for the mana than
anything but a CHeal on a massively wounded victim with a lot
of HP, and with comperably little aggro (like BH line, this works
like a buff instead of as a heal for hate purposes)  They do their
healing over several tics, a chunk at a time.  This means that cast
on an enchanter, you often see the chanter just die anyway, taking
more damage in faster than he's being healed.  Wounded people
who aren't currently in danger of death get this line.  The line is also
handy on an MA, keeping it on him effectively slows his rate of
HP loss, and its not wasted if a CHeal hits, since it just keeps  on
healing as he continues to take damage.  Any other heal that hits
before a CHeal lands is wasted unless the target gets to less HP
total than the heal gave him back before it does.

CH takes 10 seconds to cast, costs an arm and a leg, but deserves
special mention over the BS line as potentially the most effective
and mana efficient heal in the game.  On a target with lots of HP,
who has taken a lot of damage, this will heal more HP than any other
spell, up to 10,000 hp for only 400 mana.  Compare this to Ethereal
Remedy, which heals 1023 HP for the same 400 mana.  Compare
to any other heal in the game, only Torpor comes even close, and
Torpor has substantial drawbacks.  Nonetheless, CHeal is almost
never practical on an enchanter, where you will probably see
1000 hp or so in healing, if he manages to live long enough for a
ten second cast to hit at all.  An aggroed chanter needs healing
NOW NOW NOW not ok I'll get to you in a bit, hang on.
