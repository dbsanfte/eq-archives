As a SK, your chances of raising faction in rivervale without going insane
are slim.

You can do Runnyeye one of two ways:

1) You can get an invis in rivervale and bind just inside the Rivervale
zone, where there are no guards immediately in range.. The downside is that
if you are killed while in Runnyeye, which is probable, whoever in your
group has invis will have to come back to Rivervale and re-invis you so you
can get out. It's doable, but a bit more trouble than it's worth.

2)Get bound in Highpass, just inside the zone in from East Karana. Then it's
just a jaunt through part of E. Karana and the Gorge to get back.
