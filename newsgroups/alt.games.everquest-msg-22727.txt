I've had chanters tell me they don't want to stun because of the outrageous
aggro it causes, but they may well have been off their gourds; whatever
the cause I don't often find chanters stunning, for the most part its me
and paladins who seem to lay down stun barrages.

Because the damage is, relative to the target HP at levels where you
get the spells, negligible, I cast only the first three in most situations.
Although the recast on the stuns is long, if I mem all three, I always
have one available to cast immediately after the previous one, such
that the six second length turns into continuous unless the lucky mob
manages a resist.

Yes, 20 40 60 is cheaper than 35 60 90, but when most spells I'm
casting run me 240 or more, my chain stun seems negligibly cheap.

Now here's a more important benefit: you can apparantly get constant
stun with just two spells memmed, while I"m forced to mem three.

I"ve never seen this situation; there are lots of mobs that give the stunned
message (and take damage from my irritatingly tickle enhanced stuns) but
do not actually pause or break spell casting.  Are there any casting giants
in BW, so that you can verify getting that "Giant, Interrrupted" message?
