It never existed with chipped bone rods since I did it a long time ago
and still no charge, which is what the poster is asking about. I never
tried the one used one with selling a full charge one back first trick
though the other poster mentions.

I'm guessing this is only useful for charged items that were removed
from the game to keep using them? Otherwise it would make just as much
sense to simply buy new items (unless you wanted the convenience of
using any vendor for it)
