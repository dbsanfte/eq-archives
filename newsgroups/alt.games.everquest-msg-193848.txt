I agree with you, *but*... The PC version of GTAIII is superior to the 
PS2 version, and I'm sure the same will hold true of Vice City. If you 
have a PC capable of running EQ, you are doing yourself a disservice 
playing those titles on a console. The same goes for Halo... I want to 
play that badly, but I'd rather wait for a proper PC version.

As far as which console... Well, I'm into fighting games, so the PS2 
with Soul Calibur 2 (soon), Virtua Fighter 4 and Minority Report suits 
me just fine.
