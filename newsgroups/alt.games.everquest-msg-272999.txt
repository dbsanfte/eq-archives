Tell me at what point it was actually legal to jail someone without 
charges here in the US in particular, I make no claims whatsoever 
regarding any other country.  I am not asking for instances where someone 
was jailed, but where they were actually legally jailed.  Preferably in 
relatively recent history, slaves, being property under the law at the 
time, would not count, however abhorent that may be.  Even in cases such 
as for instance, a black woman being jailed because she attempted to 
enter a whites only pool, the woman was jailed for breaking the law.

So far this whole discussion has been basically, yes it did happen, no it 
didn't happen.  It is not possible to prove that it did not happen, it is 
only possible to either prove that it did, or be unable to prove that it 
did happen.
