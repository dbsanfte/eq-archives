believe i read that if you are slain by Pain and Sufferring, there is no exp
loss

anyone notice that?

like: Pain and Sufferring tries to strike you and misses, you have died
(then exp loss is noticeable)

much the same as being dot'd by a mob, then you kill the mob, but eventually
die from the dot effect..... pain and suffering has killed you and you do
not lose exp on your death

am i confusing or what
