People lie all the time for varying reasons. Attention, personal gain, to
hide something, etc. I never said I thought you were lying, however I
pointed out that it was a possibility when you consider how you stole in the
first place, but yet gave in the end.

I never really did agree with the "steal from the rich, give to the poor"
mentality, anyhow... so that lead me to question the validity of your story.

Heh, a lot of people are petty and suck at life. That probably describes the
vast majority of people.

At least you're honest about it, or so it appears...

That raises an interesting doubt in my mind. I wonder if that Gnome was
actually the owner of those items...

Returning the favour, I guess. However, even if a saint steals, they're
still a thief.

I've learned that people rarely do things for others. There's always an
ulterior motive, even if it is as benign as a self-esteem boost.

Yeah, I can understand that. I guess that would cause someone to get a bit
cut-throat.

There's nothing wrong with hating your fellow man. In fact, that is probably
the best approach.

Everyone needs an enemy. Thanks to differing view points, there has always
been one. Before Americans hated the Communists, so Americans did their best
not to be anything like them - which of course helped technology. Conflict
is the seed of progress.

A Troll is someone that posts intentionally controversial material just to
get a response from people. Those Trolls typically cross-post as a way to
introduce their writing to a wider audience.

Although, I think practically everyone has been called a Troll here
before... so don't take it too seriously.

Haha, paranoid? Perhaps I was a bit too harsh in my original post to you.

I don't think it really matters. If you spend your entire life concerned
about what others think of you, you'll only be disappointed with the
results. No one here is going to hunt you down and beat you down with a
toaster. In the end, it's all just words and opinions, and absolutely
nothing makes my opinion (or anyone else's) more important than your own.
