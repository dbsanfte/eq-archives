It takes you to the centre of the island with the wizard tower on it.
The island is full of elementals (each type on their own faction), but
providing you don't attack them, they will remain indifferent. You
will get a LOT of requests for ports to this zone, so don't mess your
faction with them. It is a safe zonein but always ask your passengers
if they have been hunting the twilight elementals before porting.
