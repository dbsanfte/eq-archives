My then lvl 10 Erudite Wizard, twinked with int stuff to a total Int of 167,
was grouping with my friends'
Ogre warrior with an Int of 60. I started at 0 Bind Wound skill and she had
6 skill and also at lvl 10.
After adventuring together for 1 lvl for her and 1.5 for me we had both
healed her after fights i had maxed my
bind wound skill (60) while she was at a skill of 28.
So yes intelligence does indeed affect skillgain in bind wound skill.
