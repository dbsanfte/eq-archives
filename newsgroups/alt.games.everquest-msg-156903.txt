Enough sense to realize this isn't a D&D newsgroup, for one thing.

Seriously, though, you need a pencil, plenty of paper, several gaming dice
(4, 6, 8, 10 and 20 sided, mainly), the Player's Handbook, and depending on
the setting, the sourcebook for the particular setting, unless you join a
player-created campaign. Might want to invest in a copy of the Monster
Manual and Gamemaster's Guide too.
