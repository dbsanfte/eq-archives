 Since your going to be on FV, that is one character max.  So you
first need to decide if your going to be a Good group or Evil group. 
This will restrict your race choices.  If your going Evil, then an
Ogre Main Tank is the way to go since Ogres cannot be stunned from the
front.

You will get a lot of different opinions.

The perfect 5 man group was (until nerfed) 5 Manaburn wizards as they
could take on anything in the game.

On FV, there is a bard only guild I believe.  So they will tell you 5
bards would be optimal.

Reality is with 5 people, just about any combo will work.

If your looking to cover all bases then I would go with:

1. SK or Paladin  (main tank)
2. Cleric         (best heals/rez)
3. Enchanter      (best crowd controller)
4. Shaman         (best slower, buffs, sow, dots, more healing, decent
melee)

The fifth one can be anything pretty much:

5. Bard           (secondary tank, most versatile class, can do
*anything*)
   or Monk        (secondary tank, Feign Death, good Damage dealer)
   or Beastlord   (secondary and third tanks with pet)
   or Rogue       (secondary tank, backstab, good Damage dealer, pick
locks)
   or Necro       (secondary tank with pet, best Dots)
   or Wizard      (best spellcasting damage dealer, ports)
