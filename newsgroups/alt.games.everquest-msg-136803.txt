This bit of advice to my guildees who have been playing longer
than 2 years...

If you died a lot at so-and-so in CT with your preKunark gear while
in your 30's, you will now die in the exact same spot at level 60...
;-)

I remember the first time I snuck through the halls and made it to
the Silver temple area (CT r0xx0rs...nothing saw through the new
sneak/hide other than AoF!!!)...I'd never seen so many freakin'
lizards...
