Rare does not mean Rare drop.    Rare means that we get a key or two a week
if we are lucky, and there are over 100 people on the list needing one. Just
in our raiding group, theres at least 3 or 4 others that are actively trying
for the same targets, and several more that while they are beyond that
level, you better not leave the mob up for too long. Demand is much greater
than supply, thus it is rare.

Easy, Sunshine.   I was not disputing that little in this zone drops for
you.  Although I did see some pretty sweet all / all range slot items on my
one raid there, and a few other miscellaneous drops from the "new warders",
nobody is denying that the main reason to do it is that some of the best
melee weapons in the game come from there.
