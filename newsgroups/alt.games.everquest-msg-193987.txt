Since this page has said UP since at least 10pm EST (its 3pm EST and I still
can't log in) I'd say it fails to be useful at all.

The servers are NOT up.

Unless there's a trick to this, like the servers saying "really up" when they
finally are back up, I don't see what use a page that is utterly incorrect are
going to do for us.
