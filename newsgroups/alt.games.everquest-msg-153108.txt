Actually I didn't (not for a while when others proved to follow the same

I didn't accuse them of not listening.  I asked if they did.  I never got a
reply from them.  The reply I did get accused me of accusing them of not
listening when I clearly asked if they did (the words were in the form of a
question, even ending with a "?").
