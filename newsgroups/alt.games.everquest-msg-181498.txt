Its not me!   He's the "tank" of our little raid ventures, and being
unguilded, he's not going to get upgrades my monk will get, for example.

But for us to kill doze.. or whoever.. its down to our MA and his HP/gear

I doubt it...  tier 2 is NP, now hes dinged 60 we will do it in the near
future.. the rest has to be quested versions though.   From what I hear, the
quests for tactics, HoH etc are retardedly long.

He can't get flagged with us...  ex member, bad blood etc.. so PoP flagging
for later tiers isn't gonna be easy
