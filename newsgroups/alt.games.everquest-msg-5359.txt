Damn, and I was going to suggest that as the new motto for the rangers, or
is that the Wood Elf Ranger motto?  OK, I have to admit, the first character
I made was one, but to my credit, I did abandon him at level 6 or so a very
long time ago.  And now for some political correctness, sorry to all you
rangers out there I may have just offended, I have actually grouped quite
successfully with some of you in the past, depends a lot more on the player
than the class.
