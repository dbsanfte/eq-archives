    So rely on someone else that brought along a tracker? Assuming someone
is there, that is.

    I think it might be things like this that discourage people from going:
on Stromm, one two-boxer (clearly played in shifts) has held the Nec Guard
camp for the past 1.5 months. On Quellious, one two-boxer (clearly played in
shifts) has held that camp for the past *3* months. One of the better camps
in the dungeon, especially if you may need to leave early, held solid by
Playerauctions plat farmers. Bleh.
