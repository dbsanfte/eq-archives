    I'm hoping for a spell-specific flag, and not a case-by-case mob flag,
just so nobody has to play the "is this mob uber enough" game. VP dragons,
easy choice for a flag. Trakanon, Venril Sathir - well, yeah. Ragefire's
dragon form? King/Queen in Chardok? Make the tag on the spell itself (this
makes encounters with mobs of less than X HPs trivial) and you don't have to
make all these judgement calls, although you then eliminate the fun of
blasting a giant spider in the Commons for 4 K damage. Last night the guild
did Veeshan's Peak. There was literally 12 seconds between "CRIPPLED" and
"Loot drops are:" announcements.
