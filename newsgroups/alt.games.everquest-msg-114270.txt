I could not afford to upgrade when Luclin came out so I canceled my
subscription until I could. (I mean why pay when I can't play) I also
got charged for an extra three months of service. I called them and
explained the situation and they credited my credit card back the fee.
Of course they DID find  record of my asking to cancel. They were very
nice and somewhat apologetic.
