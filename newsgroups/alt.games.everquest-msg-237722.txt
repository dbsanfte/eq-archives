Hi Denzi;

I too have the SBLive card. I looked all through the various properties for
an adjustment to the sound cache and can't find any or don't recognize it if
I saw it.  I have WinXP Home, can you point me to the setting for this? I
have 1gig of system RAM.  I am also looking forward to your response on how
to preload EQ soundfonts.

Thanks for your help.
