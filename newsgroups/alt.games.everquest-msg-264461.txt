Ah - that's thread is crossposted.  I was posting from a uk star trek
group.        :)

I liked the movie, and will keep an eye out for the books, if I can
pick them up second hand.   I hope there's a second AvP movie.
Ideally set a few hundred years in the future, on a colony somewhere,
so the human have decent weapons with a fighting chance.

I'm a EQ newbie.         :)

This is part of my eternal quest for a good MMORPG I can stick with.
At the moment I'm in Anarchy Online, but pretty much alone, and the

any of the new content.  If EQ2 looks good, I'll be dumping AO in
favour of it...

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes !
They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
