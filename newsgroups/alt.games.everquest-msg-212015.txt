I prefer to solo because this frees me from the commitment necessary
to grouping, and especially, to guilding.  I have seen my friends (and
my spouse) set time aside every evening -- up to six days a week,
hunting with the same people -- for two years now.  Well when I leave
the office, drive home, and finish dinner, I don't want to report in
to a secondary office and 'work' for another four hours, especially if
it's grinding a character up another level, group or no group.  I'm
looking for a release from my day-to-day obligations, and soloing
allows me to run amok and do just that.

The low-level quests in Gukta are a lot of fun, by the way, and I have
just reached the point where they peter out (level 14)...now I have to
grind a bit to keep the other quests moving, and it has become a bit
of a drag once again.  I'm sure I'll find a new way to obsess on this
game, however.
