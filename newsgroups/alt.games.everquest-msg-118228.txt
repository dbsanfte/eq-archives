Lots of other answers, but I went through the same thing with my Necro
at your level, and here's what I discovered: (Hopefully this is all
correct, but most of it was bourne out as true on eqnecro.)

You can't affect the pet's delay. If you give him a weapon with a delay
of 3 or a delay of 200, he'll still swing at normal pet /attack speed.

You can't *lower* his damage output. At least not significantly. Jabober
will swing for the damage of his fists if you give him a lower damage
weapon, but will swing for the damage of the weapon if it's higher than
his naked attack damage.

With these in mind, it's good to give the pet big, slow, heavy damage
weapons. At your level, I was stopping off on Sister Isle in OoT to gank
the sisters before every session agains the gargoyles on haunted island.
The sisters *always* drop a 10 damage rusty halbred. Until you pet can
reliabley dual weild, this is your best bet for a pet weapon. They're
heavy as hell, though, so you can't carry a lot of them around, and they
won't fit in most containers.

Once you get a pet that dual weilds reliably, this advice goes out the
window. Good luck.
