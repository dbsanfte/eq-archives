We just had an extensive discussion about this starting on
3/11 with the post titled, "Alternant Advancement" by "CML".

Here are some highlights, if you can process news links:

You don't tell us your class, but to summarize my general
position:

If you don't spend a *lot* of time in dungeons, or you're
not often a raid puller (monk or SK), you should *not* spend
any experience on AA abilities until you reach level 60. The
ability progression (skills, spells, mana pool, resists,
hps, melee damage output, taunting, AC) from 51 to 60 is
greatly underestimated by most people and is the most
worthwhile investment of your time and experience points.

If you feel compelled for whatever reason to buy AA
abilities before 60, Run Speed is probably the only thing
worth getting (before 60). I would not spend points on
attribute increases which, for the most part, have a very
marginal affect on most parts of the game and are easily
obtainable from equipment upgrades anyway.
