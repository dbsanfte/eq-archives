To actually live in, assuming it were a real place? Plane of
Tranquility. Unless you're limiting it TO Norrath, then I'd have to
pick Odus somewhere. Easy enough for Iksar to get accepted in Paineel,
I could set up a little place on the ocean shores near the river, work
on getting accepted in Erudin, and the Kerrans seem friendly enough.
Plus they have attack pandas!

If we had better immersion technology to fool us into thinking we were
our EQ characters? Cabilis.
