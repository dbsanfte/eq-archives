	All kidding aside, since I wasn't around for previous 
level cap changes I'd appreciate some insight on how this is
likely to affect things.  I'm sure we'll see at least *some* of
"level 70 camping former raid target to twink alts" but will it
be more of a problem than it is now?  

	My main concern (as one of those awful selfish casual
players 1/2 :-)  is that whereas now I can group with even very
"uber" players and hold up my end except for some of the GoD
stuff those folks will quickly get to 70 leaving me to try and
solo my way back to some sort of even footing...
