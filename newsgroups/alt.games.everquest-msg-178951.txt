I have a half-elf bard too.  I'm just about to hit 51 with him.  I think
what may be the problem is trying to play with only the old world, not a lot
of people play there anymore.  There are lots of other place with 2 other
expansion at you level that would spice up you bard experience. At you level
the Paludal Caverns (Luclin) and Lake of Ill Omen (Kunark) are very good
placed to go.  I never have had a minute of boredom with my bard.  And I'm
looking forward to even higher levels.
