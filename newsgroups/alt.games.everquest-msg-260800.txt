>Shift and up-arrow not good enough?

1.) I kept misstelling doing it that way.

2.) If you position the windows right you can hit the number on the
keyboard for the macro, then click twice, dropping the item and
confirming at the same time. Slightly faster.

I'm sorry. I only play on FV lately. I incorrectly assumed that the
components were droppable on other servers.

Aye, if I were starting a new main, I'd do it for all the skills
available. However by the time I got GoD, I already was a GM Brewer,
and had most of the remaining skills in the high hundreds. (Except
tailoring, which must be Punishment from the gods for our sins. I only
had 66 in that skill from weaving mandrake roots, so I wouldnï¿½t fail
at making leather padding so often.)
