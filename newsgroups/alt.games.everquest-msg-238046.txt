Also, to clerics, if you are going to heal over time on a shaman let him
know...nothing worse than casting your own heal over time (as a shaman), and
then having it overwritten, is an annoying waste of mana (although a small
loss).

If I tell a cleric not to heal me, and they continue to, I just let them, it
is there mana after all (clerics DO generally have an abundance of mana
anyway).

In pick-ups it is about 50-50 between a cleric healing and not healing, I do
always let them know I do not need healing unless I am being beat on.
