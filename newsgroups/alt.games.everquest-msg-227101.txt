Higher dex helps for mellee skill raise so keep an eye out for a Glowing
Black Sword. It is 1HS fairly low delay and a pretty low damage to prolong
the fight, but best of all has +20 dex. Apart from dex - try for the
quickest weapons you can get hold of in the respective class - the more
swings then the more chances for skill gains.
