The name your looking for is Trep Thilcan. He's on the onner ring in PoK.
He's a gnome, and is sitting down, so he's easy to miss. If you know where
Wilimina is ( she's the one who starts the Nedles/PLanar Travellers Quest ),
then he is just down a ways from her.

Trep's quest is a shopping quest. You have to go to 6 different places to
buy things for him and combine them in a box he gives you ( youll need a
main inv slot open for this box, as its a container ). At 53 I Still runn
this quest to make a little cash to pay fo rmy KEI's. Each iteration of the
quest I make about 34 plat ( With 114 Cha ), and approx 1/2 a blue of AA
Exp. At 39 you should be getting anywhere between 4% - 6% of your level per
iteration. You'll need about 35 plat "Seed" money to get the quest started,
but after that its a money making proposition.

Ive had some fun with this quest. As a Druid its laughably simple, and fast
to do, and its great for those times when my allergy meds make me pretty
loopy. Easy, almost danger free exp.
