Well, actually, it is a two fold problem.  One, for you not checking...
Course, if it was a Human Druid, hard to tell them apart from the Human
Monks, Human Enchanters, and Human Wizards.  Although the teleporting
Wizards, at least, the ones who can teleport groups, would have their
Familiar following them.  Two...  The Druid should have told you the best
he could do was Butcher.

In either case, Butcher, while it is not Gfay, is one of the 3 possible
ports to Faydwyer, and also the closest Druid port to Gfay that has a safe
way in for Dark races, provided the person in question is not easily lost
and ventures too close to the higher level Light Race people.  To be fair,
while it is a hassle, it is better Butcher than, say, Steamfont where you
will run across a few zones of danger.
