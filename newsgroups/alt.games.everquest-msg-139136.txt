Oh no.  I'm almost certain stun wouldn't have landed. (or if it did, it
would "succeed" but not have any effect slowing down the mob's attack.
Otherwise chainstunning would be the preferred method for killing every uber
(and semi-uber) mob)  For flash of light, if it had even landed... 1) Summon
would bring the cleric into melee range, and they would die before they left
it.  2)  Although I haven't done tests, I don't believe blind works in
combat in the way Lance seems to think it does.   If the mob is not in melee
range of the person it hates the most, it will not settle for a person
second on the hate list.  It will wander in a random direction trying to
find the person it hates most.   Against a summoning mob that kills in two
combat rounds if you're not being constantly healed, it would be a *very bad
thing* for him to wander off and start summoning the raid.

As you said, only one used it.   It's generally not expected that you will
lose every one.  As for the rest, what does it really matter which group the
paladins are in?  They'll still contribute thier melee damage, even if in an
all paladin group.  (Although I would recommend giving them a backup healer
to take care of ripostes and stuff.)

There is a pretty big shift in fundamental thinking when you're planning
groups for an entire raid, (meaning a "1 mob kill" type raid)  instead of a
single group.   Not every group needs a cleric, enchanter and tank so that
they can be successful.  Since only the main tank should be getting hit, you
ususally put two or three clerics in with him, a bard to keep thier mana up,
and the secondary tank so that if something bad happens he has the healing
with him. etc...etc...  Making a whole bunch of balanced groups instead
might still work, but it would be harder to plan out, and instead of being
more effective, it would probably be less.

Oh yes.   The hate list is just that, a list.   The mob will keep track of
the top 40 or so people that it hates, and give them points for everything
that they do to piss it off.  A melee attack may be ten points, a proc from
a weapon could be a couple hundred hate points, CH could be 1000 hate
points.  (just pulling numbers out of "somewhere", for example purposes.
Nobody except ShowEQ users (maybe) knows the exact hate values on certain
actions.)

The person on the list with the highest accumulated point total is the one
that the mob will attempt to kill.

Theres more to it than that of course, but thats the basic idea of how it
works.

It's not a bad raid.   Not one of my favorites though, since I usually end
up dying ; )   The general hits hard and fast, and has an unresistable
500ish damage proc attached to each successful hit.    With that much
damage, the main tank (me) usually ends up buying it somewhere in there.
