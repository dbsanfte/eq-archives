I realized when that event happened...
2 years and some change, and I have *never* been in Grobb.
Never made a troll, never went in to look around as a non troll.
 I had a druid many moons ago who was a traveler, and prided herself on
having seen (And died in many of) every realm she could stick her nose
in to. Literally, she had been in every non-plane or keyed zone in the
game, at the time. (Pre-Velious) at level 19. And somehow, I missed
Grobb. Wow.
