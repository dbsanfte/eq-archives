Just how difficult is it to copy over zone layout and NPC information?  It's
not.  In other words, I'm simply stating that there -could- have been more
effort (you know, an entire 1 or 2 hours) made to produce similiar events as
the ones we had last year.

Also, seems many think I am Nikko (or whatever the hell it was), while I am
not.  However, I do believe an effort could have been made to make some
enjoyable by the "vast majority" (meaning, level 1-65)  of players.

How the hell can someone be annoyed because of events in an otherwise dead
zone?  As for Rathe Mountains.. I could see the annoyance (pretty stupid
changing an entire zone around that holds so many quest NPC's).

Just a thought.
