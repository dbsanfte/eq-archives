The US is based on a constitutional democracy; and, if you think common law
is so great consider that it was used to control the common people. You have
a free society because you have  the courage to insist on it and fight for
it. Never stop.

so that the lawyers can fight over it and make scads of money

Sorry constitutional law is not where the money is. But if you need some
lawyers we could probably ship you several thousand gross.
