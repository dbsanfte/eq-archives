Funny, I had previously taken you for someone with shread of sense.
Perhapse if you were to read with an unjaundiced eye, you would see that
they are valid examples.  I believed the Unjaundiced Eye will be able to be

Fact is, you can disagree with what I say, and still acknowledge my points.
It's a technique called "discussion."  It's an upgrade to "argument," where
the best points from all around are put together to form a better opinion.
Has less of a HP penalty, as well.
