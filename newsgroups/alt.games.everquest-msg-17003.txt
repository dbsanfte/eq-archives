Here is the study done on EQ players:
http://www.nickyee.com/eqt/report.html
It shows that 50% of the female characters are played by men.

I play a male dwarf cleric as my current main. It's the only male
character I play. I feel strongly that female dwarves don't look like
dwarves- they look like halflings with smaller feet. Real dwarven
females should look more like the males, complete with full beards. It's
just my taste. 

The other advantage of playing a male is that I don't get hit on.
Sometimes it's fun to be all flirty. Othertimes, it's nice not to deal
with it.
