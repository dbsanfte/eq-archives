Sort of, but not the way you're thinking. If you wanted to make an infinite
loop hotkey, this won't be of any use to you.

This can be useful to save button-pressing, though. For example, instead of
having to press Kick, Taunt, and Disarm, you can combine them into one key
(it's most useful for procing items every 9 seconds if you have flying kick,
for example RotWF and CFs)...

You can open up the Keyboard Configuration menu from Options...you should see

Let's say instead of pressing 1, 2, 3 every time you want to Kick, Taunt, and
Disarm, you set the second (where it says none) to be 1 also.

...and every time you press 1 it will also Kick, Taunt, and Disarm.
