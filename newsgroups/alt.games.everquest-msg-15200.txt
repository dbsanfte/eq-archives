I played for about two hours last night (not straight, mind you, I got
kicked off numerous times - I'm stubborn). I still haven't formed an
solid opinion yet.

Is it going to be BETTER then EQ? I don't think so. 

Will it be DIFFERENT than EQ? Most definitely.

There are still a lot of gameplay issues that need to be fixed. I'm
just hoping that we're playing a version different than the one that's
already gone.gold.

It's certainly full of its share of whiners though. By listening to
people complaining in chat, you'd think they were paying $100 a month
to play this game.

Guys, get a clue. It's free. It's a beta version. Deal with it.

The funny thing is that with the genre, some of the d00d5 actually fit
in. Hopefully we've found a place for them to go and be happy. :)
