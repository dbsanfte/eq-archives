Even with the group exp changes there is still a fundamental
problem with grouping (imo).  And that problem is skills.

As an example you need mobs swinging at you to raise skills
like Defense and Dodge.  In a group situation and depending
on your class you may never have mobs swinging at you.  Thus
your Defense and Dodge skills will not increase.

It would be unfortunate to see people actively avoiding
groups to solo instead precisely because they need those
important skill increases.  But then to have those solo
people be upset because they aren't getting the better
group exp.

I guess what I'm trying to say is I wouldn't want players
to have to choose between group/exp and solo/skills.  It'd
be nice if things were balanced so your skills didn't lag
behind because you chose to be a grouper instead of a soloer.
