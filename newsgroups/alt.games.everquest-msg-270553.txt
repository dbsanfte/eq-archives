I'm not complaining about it here, just trying to describe it.  I think 
its overly kind to compare it to Gloomingdeep, though, in fact from the 
description on the web thats more or less what I expected.  Instead, 
there seemed to be little or no practical instruction there, its nothing 
but flavor.  The practical stuff is all in tip form, as far as I can 
tell, and the tips are only sometimes applicable and very often inscrutable.

Conceptually, the tutorial plan is a good one, and I like the way they 
walk you thru creation instead of having it be totally divorced from the 
game the way it is in EQ.  I just found it wasn't a lot of practical 
help once you arrived in the station.

Well, the thousands of points don't go quite as far as you think; it 
costs more IP to go from 6 to 7 then it did from 5 to 6... and a Whole 
lot more to go from 19 to 20.  Since the skills apparantly go up over 
220 eventually, I'm guessing we'll pay more IP for the last 20 points in 
a skill than we spend on every skill we've got at first level!

Another interesting idea is that while all skills (or almost all?) are 
available to all classes, there are differences in ease of learning.  It 
cost fewer points to raise a green skill from 19 to 20 than it does to 
raise a dark blue one from 12 to 13.  And there's a slope of some kind 
from green thru several shades of light blue up to fully blue.

Aye, its a good deal more fine tuned than the EQ approach, which uses 
encumberance and class and not much else.  I'm wearing a piece of armor 
now that required that I raise my psychic ability, which is something I 
was leaving low.  Right now while points are easy to come by, thats no 
big deal, but eventually I imagine it will make for some hard choices.

Red bar?  Oh, oh, on the stats.  Yeah, only I didn't pull that window 
up, or in addition to that I pulled up several others and it scrolled 
out of sight.  Even now I don't usually end up with that bar up, instead 
I've discovered that once you start a fight, you can switch target to 
yourself in order to see your bar and to use nano's on yourself, while 
you keep fighting the original target.  Soft living that, compared to 
EQ's insistance that you can only have one target at a time.

Engineers don't have anything like that pain bolt, but they do give us a 
gun from the start.  Only thing is, after a couple levels I ended up 
tanking for my pet, he'd get eaten waaaaay too quickly if I tried to 
have him do the job while I stood off and shot.

I did wander around and find some mission terminals, but never fought 
outside the newbie island.

On the newbie island, which is the only fighting I've done so far, there 
are no ammo salesmen, nor does ammo drop.  Thus, while I've seen quite a 
few interesting ranged weapons, I can't really use any other than the 
starter pistols (or that gun my engineer got).  In the meantime, a large 
number of melee weapons have also dropped, again, many seem like 
improvements, and if I were a melee specialist, I'd be happily gearing up!

Of course the situation there is temporary, newbie island is good for an 
evening or two at most, and then there's ammo for sale from then on.  It 
looks to me, though, as though ammo is still somewhat a concern (once 
past the solar powered starting weapons) as it means a continuous 
expense, an inventory space problem, and then there's the matter of 
reloading, which apparantly can be problematic in long combats.

By the way, I'm Dixon on Atlantean, and Quaffle on Rimor.
