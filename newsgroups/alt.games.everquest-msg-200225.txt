Well, seems you are right about the last part, although according to SOE
Rangers never were above Warriors.

Unable to find anything on a Web search I used Google instead and found Kaev
corrected me on this (I knew someone did) with a qoute from;
http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000346.html

in short (this isn't quoted)

Pre 51 There are Two Tables for damage, Standard and High

High = Monk
Std =  Everyone else.

After 51 (and after last melee dam balancing act, I mean patch)
Std = No one
High = All classes but Monk
Monks get a table all to themselves and then get another shift at 60.

Previous to this Knights and Bards were left on the Std table at 51+

So actually No class but Monk should be able to, consistently, out damage a
Warrior Toe2Toe...Yet it is accepted (by me also) that Rangers can and
do...eh?

It's generally accepted that even once a Warrior has aggro any Hybrid class
can steal it, though not hold it, if they so pleased and Rangers, if not
played correctly could steal it and hold for the rest of their (now) short
lives. I am now confused as to why a Ranger would pull so much aggro
(without trying) if they weren't putting out more damage?
