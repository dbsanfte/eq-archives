Lost mine too, ALT-S did not work.  I looked in my ini file, and the window
was enabled, and located in the correct position, and it was the correct
size.  What's weird is it was there when I first logged in, then vanished at
some point.  I loaded the default skin, and it's back, but, all the nifty
percentages and such are, of course, gone.
