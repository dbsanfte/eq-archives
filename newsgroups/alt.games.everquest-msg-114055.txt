  You're going to want at least 256 mb of RAM to run Luclin, more would be
preferable, but 256 should be good if you don't turn on all the Luclin
models.  As for processor speed, I know the official minimum requirement is
a 400 mhz Pentium II, but a GHz processor (or near it) is probably a good
idea.  However, your graphics card is probably more important their your CPU
speed... I've heard people report decent performance with 64 mb GeForce2's,
that's probably what I'd go with as a recommended minimum, but you can get
by with less.

  I don't know, I've never played it.  From what I hear, if you care more
about PvP than content, DAoC might be the game for you, but if you want a
better gaming experience overall and lots of unique areas to explore, EQ is
the better game.
