I've seen odd things happen with DoTs and kill credit.  Like a low
level Enchanter DoT tossed on a mob that was over half dead, while
I was still beating on it, and the Enchanter got the kill credit.
Pretty much the same deal as Ken's reporting.  (No, the Enchanter
did <not> memblur the mob.)

Kaev <--- wondering if Paladins will get the Shaman Slow line when
they remove DoTs from the game and toss Meem's Shaman out with 'em.
