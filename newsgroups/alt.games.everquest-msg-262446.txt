And didn't even keep pace with the growth in the GDP.  I don't actually
remember that claim ever being made, but then I don't doubt that it might
have been when he was campaigning to become president.  I'm also smart
enough to know that "a chicken in every pot" is just something you say to
get elected and means nothing.  Clinton promised a socialist health care
system (not in those words).  We don't have a socialist health care system.

I thought they were quite well done.  All lines/shading and the legends for
them easy to discern, and though I agree that the time spans are somewhat
lengthy almost to the point of being meaningless, I'm fully capable of
looking at one-third of a graph and getting the information I wanted.  =)

Reduced does not equal reversed.  If I spend $10k more than I make one year,
and then spend $9.5k more than I make the next year, I didn't reverse my
overspending.

This sort of argument is intellectually irresponsible.  "Which try to
mislead" is a "democrat" phrase, and one reason why I often consider the
democrats worse than the republicans (though I don't care for either).  The
graphs are based off of the figures reported.  I, of course, will point out
the graphs that have the best evidence supporting what I am trying to
convey, but the graphs don't "try to mislead".

Or, they are aware that there will again be a democrat president, in the
neverending cycle that exists in a 4-year, 2-term office.

You might find this amazing, but my father's opinions on politics and the
economy are not the same as mine.  Though I have to admit, and said as much
to a friend of mine when I first saw "Reagan's son" used as some sort of
argument, it makes a damn good soundbite.

Why care if the debt goes up by $1.5 trillion or $2 trillion?  If one of
those were a negative number, there would be a meaningful difference.  Right
now you're choosing a "whole lot more" debt over a "whole lot more" debt. 
Not much of a choice.

Often it is.  Sometimes, through luck and a second term in office, a
president gets to reap some of his own rewards.

By the way, you can stop arguing against me like I'm a republican.  I'm not.

Why don't you go find some figures on how many jobs would be lost if
Wal-Mart ceased to exist tomorrow.

Oh, but that's not what you meant.  You want a state-controlled conglomerate
of business serving the people...  Marx's ideas had merit, but simply don't
work in the real world.

> There's one thing powerful countries typically have in common

Yes, their name is "The United States of America".

All the rest of the "powerful countries", historically and in modern times,
have been communist (USSR, China), imperialist (Britain, France, Germany,
Spain), or...  "The United States of America".

Perhaps you have a different set of criteria for "powerful" than I do.  If
so, feel free to explain.

That's an interesting, and somewhat surreal, argument.  Thank you, I enjoy a
Monday chuckle.  =)

Talk about misleading.  Mixing percentages like that is worse than mixing
metaphors.

You have absolutely no grasp of the concept of a graduated tax system. 
Either that, or, as I cringe when I see politicans do, try to prey on the
stupid by making outrageous claims based on a "half-truth".

If I pay $5k a year in taxes, and a "rich" guy pays $50k a year in taxes,
and there's a 50% tax cut for *everyone*...

"The tax cut gave the rich guy $25k, while taking $2500 out of *your*
pocket!"

Not

"It was a fair tax cut that affected everyone equally based on their
income."
