Bah, why bother?  For any tradeskill except poisonmaking, you cannot use 
training points to raise it over 21.  Which means, for any of them except 
tailoring, it saves you an hour and about 5pp.  For tailoring, it's 
maybe 2 hours it saves you.  I'd rather do the wrk and spend the points 
learning Orcish.
