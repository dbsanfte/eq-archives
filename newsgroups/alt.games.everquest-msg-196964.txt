Excellent...  Now I can tell the people who didn't want to flag my
shammy to KISS MY ASS in PoV.  The cookie-cutter groups that the
trials made so popular proved the failure that it was to some of us
who don't belong to uber guilds and have no friends to power us
through.  I'm a 62 Shaman.  I shouldn't need "dragged" through
anything, just because I don't fit the generic mold of a DPS group.
