No, it's just that it's hard enough to get some people
into a dungeon-crawl in the first place...add in that you
just may happen to wipeout and the keys aren't
either soul-bound or the doors rogue-pickable, and
corpse loss becomes a real issue.

It's not so bad with a necro/sk to summon the corpse, but
not everybody has access to one or the funds to hire one.

Like I said, it's a GREAT dungeon.  What it isn't is a great
starter dungeon.
