Sorry, I wasn't too precise earlier.  When I said Clerics were
spoiled I meant only in terms of finding groups.  While I've
never played a Cleric from what I've gathered here the way you
describe them is right on.

I never bothered with KEI either.  Fortunately on the FV server
I never got the impression from groups that they were upset with
my lack of KEI.
