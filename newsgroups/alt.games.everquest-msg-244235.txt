Does anyone know the names of the Shadowrest NPCs and where in the
zones they are at?

I have been looking for 2 days in Plane of Knowledge for the Shadow
Rest NPC, and with 2 days of /ooc Does anyone know who the Gravyard
NPC is?  all I've gotten is "look for a dark elf".

That tells me precisely jack squat.  I really want the stuff on my
body, I need to find him/her can someone please help me?
