And that is the argument of the insensitive.  The use of the word "nigger"
by a white person is completely different than the use by a black person.
For a white to use te word as a descriptor, it is always as a racial
epithet, along the lines of the word "spic" or "hebe".  It has nothing to do
with the endearment that a black person may be fealing when using it amongst
others of their own race.  (While I do think it is not wise to use the word
or give itthe power that it seems to have).

In almost every case, using any racial epithet is hate and/or racism.  And
to not view it as such only helps to condone the racism behind the words.
