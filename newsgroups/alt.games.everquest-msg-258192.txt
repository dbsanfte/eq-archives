Like I mentioned to Bizbee, would I be responsible if I had a green light
and someone from my right decided to take advantage of "right turn on red"
and I rear-end him?  Or even just "oh, sorry, I see you want to turn right
on that red, why don't I slow down so I can let you in".

It is the same thing with merging onto the highway. If you don't believe
me ask the DMV.

(That example of the right-turn-on-red, sadly, is very applicable around
here.  Folks with red lights often act as if I'm supposed to let them in
when I have a green light.)
