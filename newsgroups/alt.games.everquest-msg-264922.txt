I'm currently running the game on an old Geforece4 4400 128MB and it
runs just fine.  I run at either the "Balanced" setting (dead middle)
or one setting down toward the performance end.  The graphics at this
setting look every bit as good as the screen shots I've seen online so
I'm happy with how it looks and its as smooth as EQ1 for me. 
(Smoother than EQ1 in PoK!)

I have never had an ATI card so I can't say how well they run the game
but if my old decrepit G4 can run this thing I find it hard to believe
the fancy new G4s won't run it well enough for the difference to be
invisible to anyone but a graphics card junky.

Don't sweat it, I'm sure just about everyone out there has a better
video card than I do and I don't have a problem.  I wouldn't call my
system out of date but its not state of the art either.   Upping from
512MB of ram to 1G definately improved things a bit but the game was
still enjoyably playabout before.

System:
P4 2.5Ghz
1G (OLD) DDR Ram
Geforce4 4400 128MB
