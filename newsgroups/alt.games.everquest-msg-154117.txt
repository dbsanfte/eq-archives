CHeal changes things a lot.  But in a way, it supports your
healing plan; every time you cast it, your target ends up at
full HP!

Prior to CHeal, a more prudent approach is to make sure
all your heals do their full value, and that as much as possible
you use your most mana efficient heal.  Once you get CHeal,
you need to get the most heal you can out of it for maximum
efficiency... but you get it so early that by and large its
useless, slow and not very efficient if you are healing people
for 1000 hp worth at a time.  In a tough fight, you need
to be even more conservative, letting people get and stay
injured, as long as you can keep them out of deaths doorway;
having three tanks in your group, each down 1000 hp, means
1000hp more healing on the MT.  After the fight is over you
can worry about how to best get everyone back up to
full health and full mana simultaneously (hint, tanks full
health and you at half mana means wasted mana.... let
them bandage, let them regen some HP, whatever you
can do to spread the load off your shoulders as the likely
bottleneck stopping them from pulling the next mob)

I'm afraid I can't really agree here.  Heals, roots, nukes, stuns,
fear, blinds,  cures, atone, melee, pet... buffs an afterthought.
Thats a lot of things clerics do, and do fairly well.  Its a lot of
ways to contribute to groups, in particular, and especially in
small groups.  Solo clerics are far more limited in scope,
I'll grant you that, root nuke root nuke is pretty much the only
viable plan for anyone but a DE Innoruuk worshipper until
the high end of the game when battleclerics get beefy enough
to take on real exp mobs more efficiently in some cases than
they can do by root/nuke.

It is a bit odd, I'll grant you, but I was doing about three quarters
this much damage before the beefing up.  Problem was, mana
regen suffered too much to make it a viable plan most of the time.
Melee damage isn't the main thing that got beefed up, it was
mana expenditure (pet cost drastically reduced) and mana regen
(Yaulp V cuts the cost of not sitting in half)

Apparantly they are listening to someone, since they rolled back
their "light blue mobs" nerf.

Bash is probably the only one that applies to you now.  The
pet was improved by dropping its mana cost dramatically.
Three new summon weapon spells were added... and unlike
the previous weapons in the line, these are ludicrously good.
Decent melee weapons, fantastic against undead, with quite
nice stats on them including 25 extra dex, they proc an 80 to
150 dd... and proc it a LOT, particularly with the extra 25 dex
but even more so with Yaulp V.  (the 58 and 60 hammers
are identicle to the 56 hammer, except with even more
outrageous proc rates)

The principle improvement, though, is Yaulp V.  Unlike the
rest of the Yaulp line, this is a gem.  Boost your dex by around
75 points (yep, with hammer and YV on my dex goes from
around 100 to around 200... making the already high proc
rate on the hammer go mad) adds to your attack (so you hit
more often) and most importantly, boosts your mana regen
rate by 10 a tic.  Sitting at high levels gives you an extra
20 mana per tic.  YV evaporates if you sit.  This means that
the difference between sitting and standing is nearly chopped
in half.... making it far more viable to remain standing and
contribute to the battle.  Since I spent long stretches of many
battles before standing to avoid aggro, this is a Brellsend even
to non-melee clerics.

Prior to the patch, the cleric pet was seldom seen and often
ridiculed.  With a 600 mana cost, putting out a little critter
that quad hit for 50 a pop or so, but with only 100 hp, that
listens to fewer commands than an enchanter summon pet,
and can only be cast with a target on your cursor, and suicides
if the target dies or is mezed and you haven't had a different mob
attack you since it was summoned... well, what a waste of
mana in most situations.  I used one to solo several cleric
epic mobs by casting then chain stunning while the pet beat
them to death, with them unable to nuke or damage me or
heal themselves... but I'm probably one of the very few.

Now, the pet costs only 250 mana to cast.  Still just as
crappy in some senses as it ever was... but add that 200
damage or so in every 3 seconds and you don't have a
bad contributor.  Mez changes (already in place) prevent
it from breaking mez, so there's no real down side to
casting it other than a little added aggro.  Get an
Enshrouded Veil and you pull cost down to 180... trivial
expenditure for a DOT that doesn't run out.  Oh, pet
is also apparantly immune to normal AOE, ripostes,
and some other effects that would rapidly erase a 100 hp
critter, although I've seen spotty results.  Certainly Enraged
kills him every time... luckily the mob is almost dead
by then so he's done most of the damage he was going to.

Enshrouded Veil is probably the cheapest focus item out
there, it has decent but not great stats, and making summoning
pets cheaper is practically useless for a real pet class, who
will summon roughly one an hour.  For a cleric summoning
one pet per mob, though, its well worth the Kpp or so
it seems to go for.

I think generally people who find clerics boring to play
are not being very creative.  If you sit, heal, sit, heal....well
yes, thats pretty static.  Even there, though, healing
well, juggling who to heal, with which heal, and when,
to maintain maximum mana efficiency and minimize death...
even when that means letting one person die to save five...
well thats a form of fun all its own, and its largely a cleric
only form of fun because we are so much better at the job
than everyone else.

But clerics can also do duty as crowd control with root,
fear, blind, atone, and stuns.

They can do duty as caster interrupt with stuns and bash
(bash helps a lot)

They can work as pullers with blind, cancel magic,
root, atone.

They can solo via root and nuke tactics

They can do melee damage... this requires a good
weapon and possibly some advanced meditation
strategy (bounce) prior to level 56... in fact between
around 40 and 56 its pretty much trivial, but if
you have adequate mana regen and crowd control
and slowing, you may find you can melee most
mobs while remaining FM.

They can do nuking damage, particularly on
undead mobs, if they have better mana regen
than is needed they can waste some mana
on shortening fights... against undead there
are groups where cleric is on full time nuking
duty with druids (victims of their lesser nuke
output) are relegated to the healing job.

If you think of porting as excitement for druids,
they can wander around rezing people and helping
out on CRs for pay or as charity work.

Divine Aura makes some things possible that
are very difficult for others as well...

Well, there's more but I've posted such lists
many times in the past.
