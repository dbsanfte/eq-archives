Right, right. Go sit over there with the casters, *they* like you. ;)

I seriously doubt he'll ever be in the mood to take anything from me :) 
especially since again, I couldn't find any faction info on him.  And

WILL LOVE ME!  Of course, how can they not?

Shadowhaven any better?  Assuming I take the time to do whatever the
