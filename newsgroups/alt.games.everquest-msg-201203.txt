What parts did you find confusing or misleading?  All I see is you 
thinking I used Lightning Strike at level 28 when I never made that 
claim.

If I can take down more than 1 red per bar of mana, it follows that I was 
taking down more than 1 red at the same time on that single bar of mana, 
doesn't it?  Where are you getting lost here?

On the contrary, looking at my posts in this thread I've hardly snipped 
anything at all.  Your questions: Explain how it's possible to take down 
two large zelniaks at the same time at level 28, and provide information 
on how twinked I was and whether I had KEI up in particular.  Do you 
disagree that I have addressed those questions in detail?  You seem to 
construe the fact that I used Lightning Strike to estimate the HP of a 
large zelniak as saying that I was using it at level 28, when in fact I 
don't make that claim at all.  I used the phrase "while I was quadding," 
not "while I was quadding at level 28 instead of root rotting."

Yes, I used a spell that wasn't available at level 28 to estimate the HP 
of a large zelniak, NOTHING MORE.  Where do you see that I said I was 
using it at that level?  I'm only asking because I'm not seeing it.

Since you can't be bothered quoting, I'll do it for you; I'm loving the 
ability of Xnews to reconstruct a thread more and more:
----- Begin Quote -----
Now, take into account that while I was quadding the large zelniaks (lvl
32-35) were taking 9-10 lightning blasts at 172 dmg (probably a high
estimate, given that I usually get at least a few partial and probably
1-2 total resists during a kite), and the large zelniaks have appx
1720hp.
----- End Quote -----
About the only thing I see here that might be confusing is that the "(lvl 
32-35)" refers to the level of the LZs, not my level while I was 
quadding.  This is the only time that lightning strike is even mentioned 
in the post.  Where do you see that I claim to have been casting it at 
level 28?

You copy and paste out of this thread where I took anything off topic and 
I'll concede.  OTOH, it might help me in my replies to know exactly what 
you're refuting my claims based on.  Based on the fact that I had KEI to 
allow me to take down *more* than two at a time while without it I was 
able to take down exactly two at a time?  Based on your opinion that two 
independently root/dotted mobs are not being taken down at the same time 
(not trying to put words in your mouth here, but you're not giving me 
much to work with)?
