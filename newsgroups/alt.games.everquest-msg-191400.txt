There's a simple error in your thinking here.  The change to horses is 
-both- a bug fix and a nerf.  It is a bug fix in that now you can't have 
the mana regen and still duck out of spells, target easily, and move 
without the 'acceleration' thing.

But it is a nerf in that now you can't have a horse on old computers with 
lag-sensitive connections, or while playing more than one account on the 
same computer.  Especially if you happen to be in a guild (like I am) 
where a fairly large number of people happen to be the same race and 
gender that you are.   It's also a nerf in that now you have to look at 
the stupid new elemental models that are harder to target, even if you're 
not on a horse.  Also, near as I can tell, horse max speed now trumps 
soe/sow/RS max speed, so even without the acceleration, I can't keep up 
with the rest of the raid on horseback no matter how buffed I am.  Cool.  
A mount that's only useful for sitting in one spot.  How novel.

/em briefly contemplates the roleplaying stupidity of getting off your 
horse, running somewhere, and summoning a new horse.  Sigh.

Basically, the most expensive thing I've ever bought is now very useful 
for having something to leave on my corpse when I'm not being rezzed right 
away.  Oh, the joy.  I should sell it back and invest in a fishing grub, 
but I keep hoping one of these days they'll actually fix the bug instead 
of trying to blindly patch over it.
