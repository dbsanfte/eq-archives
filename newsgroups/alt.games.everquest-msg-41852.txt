Rogues get an ability called evade. I don't think it's something you can
train in like other skills (correct me there, I only played my Rogue to 14)
but it does raise like a normal skill. You basically hit Hide in combat and
it will either give you a message of you cannot duck from combat or you have
evaded combat. It drops you down the hate list, like FD (not sure it wipes
it clear or not) and so the Mob turns back on the tanks who should be chain
taunting and not far below the rogue in hate, anyway.

Rogues are masters of damage (in a group) and have some nice RP type skills
that are fun to mess around with. Solo they are weaker than Warriors, having
no (real) self heal and less armour class and Health they become group
dependant before a warrior does (unless heavily twinked) They are also often
overlooked in groups, some people don't seem to realise how much damage a
rogue will do with standing behind a mob.
