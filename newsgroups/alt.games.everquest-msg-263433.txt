I've always seen "casual" as referring to outlook on the game and what
you play for. A casual gamer, IMO, is one who plays for content, RP,
and just for the fun of the fight. As opposed to the power gamer, who
plays to "win" -- for levels, gear, and other rewards and bragging
rights. A casual gamer, IMO, isn't overly concerned with how fast his
xp bar is moving (Unless it's grinding painfully slow even with heavy
grinding *coughcoughLineage2andFFXI*) and doesn't mind that he might
take years to hit max level if he ever gets there.
