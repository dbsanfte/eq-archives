    You understand incorrectly. This is how Rampage works:

    People are added to a list the mob keeps, the Rampage list, in the order
they originally hit the hate list. So for example, the monk puller is number
one on the list, the main tank that intercepts the mob is number two, a
melee who attacked too soon is number three, and a cleric that heals the MT
is number four. Rampage will "go off" every so often - it works like a proc.
When it does, the person highest on the Rampage list that is in range and
who is not also highest on the aggro list will be attacked by a round of
attacks. Any effects that a mob can proc, like the Harm Touch proc the
General in Ssra has, can be procced on the Rampage target.

    To continue the above example, the monk puller pulls the mob. Rampage
goes off, but since the puller is the only person on the hate list, it does
nothing. Then, the people on the raid are added to the hate list in the
order I listed. Next time the mob Rampages, he hits the monk since the main
tank is highest on the Rampage list. The monk wisely Feigns, and the
overzealous melee gets Rampaged. Seeing what's happening, he backs up out of
range and the cleric gets Rampaged. If the overzealous melee moves back in
range, Rampage will switch back to him. If Rampage does enough damage to get
him low health aggro, the mob will switch to him and the main tank will
start taking Rampage damage.

    We have seen evidence that the Rampage list is preserved for quite some
time. Specifically, we've had people who were rampage tanks get ressed back
in within rampage range and get killed the next time a rampage went off.
We'd play with mem blurs to understand this more, but mem blurring a mob
that requires a rampage tank is bad. There are small mobs that rampage - we
might go play with them some day to see what we can find out.

    Rampage rate is independent of anything players do except debuff DEX on
the mob. What you see is good old low health aggro - the mob is switching to
the people that got rampaged.
