I had done all of my epic parts up to the hole. An opportunity has
come up to MQ a tear, so I decided to go for faction.

I did woe/envy/Marr's 8 times over the last weekend, bound at the
Tabien spawn point in Rathe, then used my druid mule to port me
around. :)

Well, after 8 I was still not max, then I read that the gem turn in
speeds things up.. I had not been doing it. So I port to EJ and turn
it in..

"Your Faction With Truespirit could not possibly get any better"

Yay!

So I know if you have done all the parts up to the hole, that 8
woe/envys and 1 gem in EJ will max it lol.

Now I have to get the turn in shammy to EJ to con the spirit to see if
he is still ally.. he finished his epic a LONG time ago.
