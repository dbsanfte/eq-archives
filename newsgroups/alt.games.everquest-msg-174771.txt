Did I blame the Americans soley?  I thought id clearly stated the NATO
attacks were illegal.  If you assume NATO to mean "America" then thats your
problem...

It had soldiers from many countries "risking their lives" (well, as risky as
dropping bombs from 10,000feet in the air gets)

And if Iraq is attacked, whether the UN sanctions/helps too, is irelevant to
the fact it has all arisen because of the US's pushing/demands for action
