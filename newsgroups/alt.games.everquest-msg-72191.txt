I have been wanting JBoots since I heard of them. My main is a level 21 Wiz
(Don't get many chances to play with School, but on Xmas vacation I want to
make 29). I think I f I spend lots of time at 29 being a portmonkey, I think
I can make enough to get Tboots instead, which I see as just as good.

Here's my mental comparison:
JBOOTS:
Wait until 35
Camp the AC and possibly die, spend hours camping and finding him

TBOOTS:
Wait till 29 (Lots less time!)
Be a serious portmonkey and make mad cash
Make new friends in porting
Buy Tboots, none of the death chances or camps.

Does everyone else see this as a viable plan? How much are TBoots, what
faction is the merchant attached to, and how much are they (range)?

Thanks to EVERYONE who replies! WHOOO!
