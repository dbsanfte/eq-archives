Forest loops: seriously overpriced, yes.  But they're cool if ya have 
them. :)

}imbued gems however...

I've been a 250 jeweler for a few months now... and in all my jeweling 
career, I've had -one- person even inquire about imbued jewelry.  He 
wanted Gold Ivory.  I was ecstatic.  I have an alt that even had some 
ivory saved up in case this ever happened... Imagine my annoyance when it 
turned out he didn't know you -had- to be a follower of the tribunal to 
wear them...

If someone were to come to me with pre-imbued stones, I'd be more than 
happy to help them out.  I even have an alt with a couple plains pebbles 
lying about... I so wish they were stackable.
