Really? I think that I deserve prefrential treatment over all other
customers and snap to it . Other than that compensation for services
rendered can be anything that both parties can agree to in a transaction. I
think the company got off dirt cheap actually . They gave something that had
no value to themsleves for several hours of slave labor. The recipient was
also pleased in spending several hours getting something that would normally
have taken far longer. Both parties are happy with the transaction. All
complaints from the peanut gallery are sheer envy ;p
