There'll be an uproar over it. There was one over the Nexus system and
the Soulbinders. Ooh, wah, I won't have to rely on greedy bastards to
get around anymore. I don't have to have my non-binding classes sit at
city gates begging for a bind and ending up having to fork over cash
to get one anymore.

Bah. They'll get over it or they'll leave. Either way, doesn't bother
me one bit. (Yes, as most people know, I DO play a class that's "hurt"
by the transportation systems, and I do play binding classes. Guess
what? I don't care... I'm all for the additions. )
