   I think that there could be several different answers to this question,
depending on how strongly one feels about animal rights.  Some feel that animals
shouldn't be subject to human influence at all.  That means no enslaving animals
as pets, not KFC on the way home, no animal testing of any kind no matter how
many lives the testing may save.  Then there's the other extreme.  The people
who dress their declawed pet cat in humiliating costumes while eating a big ol'
ham sandwich and really do give a crap how many rabbits met their end so they
could wear their face by Mary Kay.   I suppose the correct answer for you
depends on your deciding where you vrs. skunk descenting land on this continuum.

    A good way to start this process is to find out if their is a consequence in
the animal expert community as to whether or not descenting has any noticeable
impact on the skunks quality of life, other than rendering it suitable to being
kept as a pet with an assured food supply, and much greater safety from the
inherent dangers of an outdoor lifestyle such as speeding cars.
