As many people here have pointed out...  You are wrong in this case.

As Kill stealing is defined as 'attacking a mob currently engaged with
another player, gaining experience and loot from the mob without the
express permission of the other player.'  Given the guy was fighting it and
obviously told them to back off, they did kill steal.

What he did was break player ettiquette.  He did not ask if he could be
there, he jumped on someone's 'camp'.  Thing is, Camping is not an
enforceable thing.  No one can claim rights to a mob, it is player
ettiquette, where you build your rep depending on your actions.  Your rep
gets passed on to people and those people will then decide whether or not
they want to group with you in the future because of your reputation.  The
more and more you build a bad rep, the less likely you will get into groups
or be able to progress further because you slowly get shunned by others and
soon, you will find it hard for you to gain XP or money because of the lack
of places you can hunt to gain either.

In the group's case.  If that guy were to run through their group with the
mob cause he couldn't handle it or yelled for help, he should have been
left alone to die or if he got an add, you don't touch it.  If he runs
through your group, just to dump the mob on you guys, it would be
technically considered a training issue and that is something that could be
used against him.

Either way, the thing to do is if someone pushes their way pass you, they
are on their own.  You are under no obligation to save their ass if they
didn't do the work to get to that point.
