Agree... pre-EQ/AM archery is pretty gimp

With it tho, heck it doesn't need anything to work out to outdamage a
monk... keep the mob out the wall, and watch those non-critical hits for 1k+
roll in!

In the arena last night with an AM2 ranger..  my AC was about 1490, and he
was shooting me for 400+ each time.  He only has AoW bow too (not even as
good as primal, or so im told by rangers)
