I too went into blackburrow with my 41 ranger and decided to kill the first
gnoll I saw before going to Jaggedpine to see if there were any faction
differences.  No faction differences, but after hitting the gnoll for 29,44,46,
and 27 I realized something was up.  Conned the Gnoll Courier and he showed up
dark blue to me, so he must be in the upper 30's.    He dropped some kind of
ring, but I forget the name.
