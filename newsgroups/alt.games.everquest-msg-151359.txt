Why does everyone always suggest the UP key?  I press and hold the UP key
when running anywhere, but press left and right almost constantly.  If you
lace the HotKey for SH to both left and right or even just one of them, you
will see it max out for level all the time.  Also since when you are
pressing left and right you are generally trying to figure out which
direction you are going and changing your course, hence putting the SH key
on the L/R keys makes the most sense (no pun intended).
