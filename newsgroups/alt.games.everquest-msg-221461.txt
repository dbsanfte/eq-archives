You do not have to be moving for it to count as swimming, but I have
found places where you can get 'wedged' into a corner ( and it would
pop you out of the water if you were facing one of those walls
directly) and you don't get skill ups there.

My personal favorite place to get a skill-up is Shadow Haven (at the
nexus zone in area).  You pop into the water, look up, and run into
the center platforms.  You will not jump up onto the platforms in the
center, to get out you have to go to the outer walls.

On another side note, it does take a long time to go from 185 +.  My
enchanter with 255 Int took about 3 hours to go from 188 to 200.
