Of course Lokari thinks it's a good idea. All his ideas are gems. His
opinion is true, yours is nonsense. read anything he writes. He is, of
course, in the minority, as always, and possesses a magnificent amount
of sel-rightousness. He is singularly the most annoying person on the
NG. Don't try to debate with him. He is never wrong, VI is never
wrong. His shit smells like bath oil beads.

As for the content, of course it is a shame that they made system
requirements so high. Lokari is right in that software pushes hardware
and you are correct that it pushes too much and too fast to the
annoyance of the avergae gamer (not Lokari the High One, of course, to
whom cost is no issue if VI says so).
