Bloodpoint won't proc until 50 so wait on that one (price would have dropped
more by then) Bloodfire could set you back anywhere between 6 and 9k
(depending on server) Venomous axe would be a good choice if you have the
cash, 11/24 again, +10AC and procs an 85pnt poison based DD, 2 - 3k (MAX)
for this, procs at 35.
You are getting to the point where your damage bonus will make the faster
Lamentation a better damage dealer than the Wurmslayer. I'd suggest, on a
budget, either a second lammy or a Centi LS for off hand and move Lammy to
primary or maybe a Crystallized Spider fang, 10/22 for off hand. .

Weapon to avoid, or take care on, Black Blade of Tormenting. it's 9/22 and
procs torment, the seller will likely tell you that this some rediculously
high dot, it isn't, it's like 20dd and 50pnt DoT. It does, however, piss the
mob right off so it's good for aggro but don't pay over 1k for one (wouldn't
expect to pay even that much these days) but I have seen these for silly
prices.
