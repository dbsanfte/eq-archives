	MM (monster missions) suck :-)

	You can do them at level 1, because all the characters become
"monsters" - sort of npc's - for the thing.  You don't need to know
how to play your class because the monster classes are all very different
(mostly simplified) versions of player classes.  For instance, in the
Dain 1 MM, if you know the strategy, the players with the cleric characters
remember to click "heal" every so often, and the warrior knows that he's
supposed to click a mob and type 'a' you can hardly lose.  Loot "scales"
so that when you pop back out whatever you won becomes appropriate
for your level, and...there's no death penalty, you just fail to win.

	They're also boring as hell.  I sometimes take a MM group if
I've been lfg for more than an hour.  It's a good way to grind out AAs.

	But it's boring as hell.
