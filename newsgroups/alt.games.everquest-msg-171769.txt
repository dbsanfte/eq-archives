They basically just gave away the rights of anyone accused of terrorism. =
What will you do when they accuse YOU of terrorist activities.=20
WASHINGTON - In a high-profile affirmation of the government's powerful =
new counterterrorism laws, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that =
authorities can freeze the assets of a U.S.-based global Islamic charity =
without providing evidence -- in this case, of a suspected terrorist =
link -- to defense lawyers.

Both Justice Department officials and a lawyer for the charity described =
the ruling as a precedent-setting case that upholds some aspects of the =
USA Patriot Act and other counterterrorism measures implemented after =
the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.

``This is a very significant victory for the administration . . . not =
just with regard to organizations accused of having terrorist ties,'' =
said Jonathan Turley, a constitutional law expert at George Washington =
University Law School who has defended many cases involving issues of =
national security.

Specifically, the three-judge panel of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of =
Appeals, based in Chicago, sided with a lower court in finding that the =
government had the right to freeze the assets of the Global Relief =
Foundation in 2001 because of allegations that it was tied to terrorism =
-- and to do so without presenting its evidence in a public forum.

``The statute is designed to give the president means to control assets =
that could be used by enemy aliens,'' the court ruled.

Turley said that before the terrorist attacks, defense lawyers in cases =
involving national security were given either special clearance to =
review classified information or specially edited versions of such =
documents.

But ``since Sept. 11, the government has said it would share nothing =
with defense lawyers,'' he said. ``This is a problem that has become =
evident in a variety of areas -- the freezing of terrorist assets, the =
Moussaoui case, the Guant=E1namo detainee cases. In all of those areas, =
the administration has balked at sharing information.'' Zacarias =
Moussaoui was charged as a co-conspirator in the Sept. 11 attacks.

The ruling, Turley noted, could undermine the government's argument that =
it needs military tribunals to try terrorist suspects because federal =
courts insist that defense lawyers be provided with evidence involving =
national security issues.

Previously, several lower courts had viewed the government's refusal to =
share such information ``with considerable skepticism,'' Turley said. =
That makes this ruling extremely significant, he added, especially since =
the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals is a well-respected middle ground =
between the conservative 4th Circuit in Virginia and the liberal 9th =
Circuit in California.

``The court's decision has laid the solid legal groundwork in support of =
the final designation of Global Relief Foundation as a terrorist =
organization,'' said Justice Department press officer Charles Miller.

Roger Simmons, a lawyer for Global Relief, said the ruling was a =
continuation of unfair U.S. actions that have effectively shut down one =
of the largest Islamic charities in the world since the Treasury =
Department first linked it to terrorism more than a year ago.

Simmons vowed to bring the case before the entire 7th Circuit panel of =
appeals judges to gain a reversal and force the government to release =
Global Relief accounts that have been frozen, and to allow other =
governmental and business entities to do business with Global Relief.

``If I can't get a reversal there, I'm going to the Supreme Court,'' =
Simmons said. ``What's bad about this . . . is that the key issue in the =
case is the question of whether we supported terrorism and that the =
government can rely upon secret evidence to make its case. How do you go =
about proving your innocence when the government can rely on secret =
evidence that you can't even see?''
