Today, in the Oasis of Marr, my level 10 Wizard was grouping with some
higher-level people (most were 12-14, some lower, some higher.) Thus, just
about every pull conned red to me, so I didn't know how strong they were in
relation to my group, so I nuked it to see how much damage it would do, and
decided whether to chain cast or be conservative from there. However,
certain enemies kept resisting my spells.

What's the proper ettiquite for a wizard when they're spells are being
resisted? Should they sit down and med for the next fight, or go hand to
hand? OR should they keep nuking, in the hope that a nuke will eventually go
through? I figure that medding was the best idea, since I was at low mana
through most of the time, anyway...
