You want me to put up the example of how contracts and consideration is
*taught* in law school for you to "take apart"?  What an interesting
concept.

To the court, your offer of $1,000 sets the value, and the court has no
reason (nor inclination) to dispute that value.  When you say, "But Judge,
the pebble is worthless" the response will be "You're the one that offered
$1,000 for it."

Are you illiterate?  "as a general proposition, inadequacy of consideration
will *not* vitiate an agreement".  It is spelled out for you, in the case
you yourself cited, and you continue to try and suggest...  Oh screw it. 
I'm not interested in arguing with an illiterate.
