Well, as far as "unpopular" goes, I think that's quite subjective.
Regardless, just because they may be a twink, doesn't mean they're an
undesirable player.

"Why would they?" Why not? The starting stat bonuses are helpful but
not exactly a *huge* advantage.

opinion of those in the right. Sure, some people who take up the
halfling ranger combo will be lazy twinks, but there will also be
plenty who are in the right.
