BiddersHut.com is a newly launched auction site that is focusing on
online gaming auctions. For the first month (ending January 31st)
they're offering free auctions (no placement fees and no final value
fees, only charges for optional auction enhancements). Also, a copy of
Asheron's Call 2, Neverwinter Nights, or Battlefield 1942 is given to
a random seller and the high bidder of that auction (if there is one)
every week, chosen from a list of auctions that ran last week. This
isn't supposed to spam, this site was created for gamers, by gamers,
and traffic is badly needed.

All we ask of you is to place a few items for auction. You don't pay a
cent and you give yourself a chance to win a copy of some of those
great games. If you want browse around and see if something catches
your eye. An item that you would normally sell for $5 on E-Bay would
net you under $3 profit after E-Bay takes their share, at BiddersHut
it would be all yours. If the items don't sell, or for whatever
reason, just turn around and relist them on E-Bay you have lost
nothing and at least have given yourself a chance to win some great
games and given our new site a chance.

Thank you
