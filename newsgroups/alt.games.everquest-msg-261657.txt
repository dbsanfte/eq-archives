It shouldn't be strictly time-based at all.  Gear should wear out
based on being used.  So if you go on vacation for a month you don't
come back and find a month of decay on all your gear.

Of course, then you'd have people swapping in lower gear to save
wear on their top gear.  "I don't need my Mace of Uberness for this
fight!"  Which could be okay, or could be a pain in the neck (well,
wrist, more likely).

And there'd also be the possibility of extending the lifetime of gear
by "repairing" damage via tradeskills.  Your shield gets dinged up a
bit, so you take it to a Smith to get it fixed.  Still not quite as
good as new, but it'll last a while longer.  Just like real life (back
in the day, of course).
