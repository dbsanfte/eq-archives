Exactly. Yeah, it was tragic. Lots of people died. A long time was
spent in mourning. Now, people, get on with your lives. You can honor
their memories without reliving and analyzing the day for the rest of
your life.

buttons to try to get ratings. "See? We care more than the other
stations! We ran more tributes than they did!"
