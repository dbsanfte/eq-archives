I did say Ogre and Troll Warriors...

Rallos Zek imbue is Jade, which is a relatively cheap vendor-bought gem.  
Not an obstacle of any sort.

The real obstacle is the sheer difficulty of smithing the items.  On 
eqtraders, one of the Ogre smiths got his smithing skill up to 250 (the 
maximum) and NONE of the enchanted-imbued was trivial.  If you have not 
smithed yourself, you won't understand why most smiths burn out in the 180 
range, which isn't an acceptable level to try to smith enchanted-imbued.
