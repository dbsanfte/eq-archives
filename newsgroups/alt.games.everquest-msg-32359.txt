Exactly my point, and thank you for supporting it.  My wife has been
going into the school daily for some weeks now, even in the middle of
summer "break".  This at the same time she was completing her masters
program in education (so that she could keep her certification, here
in PA teachers have to take a certain number of college
credits/inservice hours per every so many years to stay certified) and
attending required seminars, etc.

I think she gets paid a fair salary for her work, given that it is a
public service postion.  It's only just fair, and only has been for
the last decade or so, before that teachers were being paid peanuts.
But, this is off-topic, so I'll let this be my last word on the
matter.
