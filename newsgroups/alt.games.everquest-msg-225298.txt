But it isn't likely to get fixed (or get any attention at all, for that
matter) without a solo-oriented server (which I would rather see, instead of
solo-only).

I have, at last count, 8 RL friends who play EQ. Five of them started
playing before I did, and several of them have a lot more time to play than
I do. All of them have characters of different levels. If I'm playing with
my level 30 monk should my friend be expected to log on a character of
similar level, even if they were having a good time playing their 65 wizard?
Of course not. But we can still communticate, even if we aren't grouped.
That's what friends do.
