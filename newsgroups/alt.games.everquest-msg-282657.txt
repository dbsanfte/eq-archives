Nope. Nor am I interested.

I don't even have DoN or DoDH. Even though I purchased a sealed boxed
copy of DoN off a retail store shelf. Either someone swiped the
registration code and resealed the box, or SoE neglected to put a
registration code on the CD sleeve. No stores in my area will accept
software that's been removed from the stores premesis, even if it's
still shrinkwrapped (the store also sells shrinkwrap machines, and too
many people returned shrinkwrapped bricks or bags of sand back in the
90's). SoE refused to provide me with a replacement code, instructing
me to exchange it at the store from which I purchased... even after I
told them it was the only copy left, and that the store did not accept
software returns or exchanges.

SoE has not left me with a favorable impression. I'll play out my
remaining subscription, but probably not much after that.
