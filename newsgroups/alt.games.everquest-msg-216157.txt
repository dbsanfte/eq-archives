Hasn't been my experience.  Granted, even my lower level characters qualify
as "well-geared" due to my enjoyment of twinking, but that's me and not the
rest of the group.  In my runs as my ranger (dinged 52 in an LDoN
adventure), we don't have much worry of wiping.  It's not like the dungeon
is *so* hard that we're constantly on the edge of losing.  It is, in fact,
much like it is at 65.  Play with a minimal amount of intelligence and don't
panic and it's a cakewalk.

I will point out that if you have no enchanter, bard or necro, you probably
have enough melees to deal with a few adds without any issues.  :)
