Yeah, I know, wasn't debating that, just asking.  I wonder if another hidden
stat affects it.  I think STR is supposed to influence success in smithing
(I totally forget) and DEX for fletching?  No idea...all I know is that by
the time I was done I didn't have a whole lot to show for it.

Still, it was needed for shawl 3 or 4 and it was worth it.
