Raiders are an admittedly slim minority of EQs total population. And 
we're catering to them now. I'm saying we should cater to the majority, 
and do our best not to knock all your legs out from under *you*.

Of course. The status quo currently favours you. You'd be a fool to 
advocate letting SOE play with it. That said, suck it up, you've had 
your time in the sun; take your knocks and roll with it. :)

Never said they were bad players. I said they created a lot of BS. And 
they do, perpetually whining about or manipulating politics, loot 
policy, dkp systems, raid targets, for their own self interests. People 
who just love raiding and want to progress tend to be waaaay less self-
involved about their personal progression, and consequently are much 
more fun to hang with.

Trouble is with DoN in particular, they are rubbing elbows... and its 
causing a lot more friction. Going back to GoD where we were isolated 
eliminates that friction but created the equally legitimate complaint 
that 3 out of 4 players who got GoD weren't able to play it.

(I don't actually have a problem with RAIDER ONLY expansions... but SOE 
historically tries to stick just enough utility into each expansion that 
even the most casual players will feel gimped without it.)

I think the status quo is unsustainable. 

A better analagy is a man dying on lifesupport. Sure we can leave him on 
lifesupport, and he'll slowly die. Or we can perform surgery and maybe 
we'll actually save him, though he might die as a result.

I say go for the surgery.

Especially since the odds of any major surgery killing EQ outright is 
very slim. Sure we'll inevitably piss somebody off, but if the game 
itself is better at the end of it it'll last longer than it would have 
otherwise.
