Is that the free EQ disk you got in some magazine where you're playing on a
server that only other free EQ disk users play on?

If so, and you decided you like the game you're probably going to have to
buy the real version, aren't you?  If that's the case as well, just create a
new station name after you go out & buy the game, and use the new CD key to
activate it.

And THIS time, write down the danged information...it's not like you had all
that long to forget ALL of your info. :)
