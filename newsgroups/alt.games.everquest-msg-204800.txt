Most *non-evil* race/class/faith combos. My main is (capped) at warmly with
the Legion, and (not yet capped) amiable with everything else except the
necros (which I could get to a decent level, if I so desired). Admittedly, I
get a nice boost from being an erudite SK (i.e. no class issues and same
religion), but the only evils that have serious issues with Cabilis factions
are RZ ogres, iirc.
