No.  But they do have to do a software upgrade to DirectX 8.x,
if they haven't already.

More than fine.  And they won't even have to do the hardware if they
don't buy the Luclin expansion.

Sound should be fine.

Sounds like a video driver that needs to be updated to a
DX8 compatible release.

Me too, since that makes no sense whatsoever.  After a boot, there's
no *WAY* Everquest could *possibly* affect the speed at which a modem
dials up and connects.  Everquest installs *no* system DLLs, makes
*no* registry changes, runs *nothing* at boot time, etc.  It's
entirely self-contained in its installed directory.  It simply *can't*
affect any part of the system until its actually run.  After a fresh
boot, it, for all practical purposes, doesn't even exist as far
as Windows is concerned.

Are you sure you don't work for the DAoC people?

If your system isn't up to Luclin, don't buy that expansion.  The rest
of Everquest will keep cruising along as well as before, in fact
somewhat better -- the new graphics engine, which is being released
to *all* EQ players, has improved hidden-surface removal algorithms which
will lower the load on everyone's video cards for existing zones.

Doubtful.

I ask again -- do you work for the DAoC folks?  Your spreading of
F.U.D (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) sounds calculated to try to
discourage people from EQ.
