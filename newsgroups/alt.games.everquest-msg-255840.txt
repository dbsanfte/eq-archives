Are you saying that a powergamer can't be a complete moron? I'd disagree.

I don't think I said (and I didn't mean to imply) that *skill* is 
required to powergame. Powergaming requires a different mindset than a 
casual gamer. A casual gamer can spend 3 times the amount of time in the 
game as a powergamer and only get half as far.

Perhaps, I really don't know and that wasn't what I was discussing.

Nothing you said above makes the case that time invested defines you as 
a powergamer. If I spent 5 hours a day, seven days a week, playing EQ 
and at the end of a month I was only level 10, would I be a powergamer 
in your eyes?

I spent my entire 4 hours last night working on one small aspect of a 
quest. It required running back and forth between east commonlands and 
north freeport a couple times, killing 1 guard, 1 squire NPC and a few 
Desert Tarantulas. All in all, at level 12, after spending 4 hours in 
game, I think I got like 20% of my needed xp for level 13. Had I been a 
powergamer, that same 4 hours could have easily gotten me to level 13. 
See my point? A power gamer is NOT defined by playtime so much as what 
they do with that play time. Of course, some power gamers are more 
serious than others and DO put in more time and DO get better loot and 
whatnot than the more "casual" powergamer (pardon the oxymoron).

I guess my point is that being a powergamer is a *mindset*, not simply 
the number of hours you've logged. But, if you are a powergamer, then 
yes, the amount of hours you log to make a difference in your success as 
a powergamer.
