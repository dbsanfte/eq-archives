Ok, you got me there.  My mind was more on people like Cowdrey and Whitmer.
Yes, several of the witnesses were related to -eachother-, but that's not
what I was talking about.

And if we go back to Noah, we're all related.  Ok, I'm thinking 3rd cousin
is a bit far out to be considered.

Three of the witnesses, my mistake.

I am more than aware of the history.  True, I misspoke when I said they
weren't related, but it's not like Bebinn said, either.  I over reacted,
something I'm very prone to doing.
