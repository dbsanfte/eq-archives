As opposed to what?  They fit in the new JC items before but had no 
effect, IIRC.

I don't get what they are saying here.

On every raid mob, that is to say, any mob that "takes an army to 
defeat"?  Or just specific ones, and if so why so coy?

WOW nice, I mean, my cleric's Pious Elixer already did this but its a 
big boost to earlier HOTs, can hopefully this includes my SK's Bond of 
Inruku recourse.  Never did understand why short duration buffs like 
this were going in the long duration buff window.

Now move my Theft of Hate et al recourses up there too!

I have a friend who's been having a great time with her new Raging 
Servant and these two items were definate complaints she's had... nice 
upgrade.

Go go /spellcheck.  Only 9997 more spelling errors left to correkt.

Umm... whats a mana recursion buff?  This is probably a good thing but I 
  plead ignorance.

Hmm.  I don't think I like this. One, taking up two buff slots with one 
buff = bad.  Two, IMO skellie form is the price you pay for the mana 
regen, my Pact of Hate is the same deal, and I just have to deal with 
it. I guess now I won't either, or maybe I will, they said Necro not 
-necro type-

I'll miss this, it kept me cognizant of those  buffs and what was going 
on.  But in the end it was probably mostly just spam.

And there was much rejoicing!  Now lets see about letting them live thru 
wild ramp?

Oh come on now, would it have hurt to make higher level alacrity potions 
Really?  50% haste is so close to capping me with a 45% haste item. 
That one more level would have sealed the gap.  Anything over 55% would 
only help people with lesser haste items compensate for their poor 
gear... and given that they'd need to be 75+ to quaff the potion, I 
don't see how thats a bad thing.

I thought there was already a regeneration potion... whats this new line 
do if not that?

Spiritualism line potion is a slap in the face to beastlords, thats been 
reason for people to make the effort to include a token BST in every raid!

I know, you're all scratching your heads in befuddlement over this 
one... its because SCC required a part bought in a TBS zone, while on 
Combine we just opened PORo.  Quest from PORo that required a TBS part 
makes no sense, was it always implemented this way?  What did the rest 
of you do before TBS was released?

Ooh, SK get some love.  How about giving us something for our Unholy 
Aura discipline though?  No, just a graphics fix.  <sulk>
