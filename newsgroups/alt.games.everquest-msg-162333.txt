Got flagged for this a couple days ago, but with a guild that
needed a little clerical help to make the flag, and invited me
along.

Upshot is, I have the flag but only one other person I know has
it.  Calls for LFG prefer Terris Thule have yeilded no response.

I did hear that there are two see invis big bad guys you hit
immediately on zoning in, so you need a group and the group needs
to coordinate well on coming in, what with the random zone times,
anyone needs to be prepared to survive alone for a few seconds if
need be.

This prevents me zoneing in on my own to check things out and/or
try putting out the redlight of my lfg flag.

Whats it like in there?  IS it a seperate zone, or will /ooc LFG
TT in PoN reach people inside?  Would one strong group do well in
there, and would they want to = exp, loot, parchments, more
flags, what?

Bergh "still no PoV flag" Brelltender... 62 cleric again, but
heck, whats 63 with no spells anyway?
