I'm with you.  I think most people who think cleric is boring just
haven't played them to a high enough level.  I got bored with my
cleric around level 30 and played other classes for a while, then came
back to him.  He's in the 50's now and I love him.  I can think of
very few classes who have to make so many split-second, life-or-death
decisions in that combat where your party is just teetering on the
brink of wipeout.  It's exhilarating.
