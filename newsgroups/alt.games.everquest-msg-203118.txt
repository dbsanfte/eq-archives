One of the effects of wolf form (or any other illusion) is to hide all data
about your character from other characters including non-player characters.
Since it's built in to the spell to hide your identity (including race,
class, and level) from one part of program (the NPCs) why is it so far
fetched to see how it might hide it to the rest of the program as well?
