Excellent idea.  The main reason I would say druid over
shaman is for one, very simple, tiny reason...ports.

Shaman can SoW, which is great for travel, but I bet
if a soloing shaman and a soloing druid raced from
Butcherblock to Toxulia at level 40, the druid would
win (and make plat on the stops in between :-)  ).

Actually, this is the one time  I _WOULD_ want
to play a monk.  If I had somebody along 100% of the
time to hold loot and change for me always every
day when I played, I'd never pick a warrior over
the monk.  Especially on a new server where you can't
just drop  some Wu's on the monk without saving every
copper until level 30.

Why? The rogue class isn't limited to "thieves" or
"assassins."  It's just a warrior with a slightly
different approach to fighting.  Heck, my half
elf was raised by dwarves, and learned her
skills as a respected tunnel rat, scouting out
new tunnels and stealthily fighting off hordes
of goblins and orcs underground.  She's never
broken into a house or killed an innocent for
money, but her screen still says "rogue."

My main, though, is a halfling rogue.  Dirtiest
thief you'd ever meet...
