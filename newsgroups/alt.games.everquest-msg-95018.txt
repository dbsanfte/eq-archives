I am soooo proud to say that I tanked him and we kicked his ass with
only one group of levels 10 - 14 :*)
My paladin Fellmer was level 12 at the time, I think, maybe 13, and
I was a little armor twinked (not much, no haste or regen stuff), using a
cheap
enameled black mace and a shiny brass shield...
We were aggroed at the derv camp, and I started crushing, bashing and
taunting
for all I was worth, while the cleric tried to keep up with heals.
I think we had a rogue BSing, then a necro with his pet (nice guy was
willing
to take the faction hit) and I had to shout at the group to stay and fight
when
my health dropped down to critical level, applied my lay on hands and
continued to whack him. I got down to like 20 health again, had to back
off a little, even the necro had been lifetapping/healing me a little, I
think.
But when I got down to like 10 health the bitch finally started running,
and so it was done :)
Boy I felt uber after that fight. Actually I think that was the best newbie
fight/group I have EVER seen. Complete pickup, not any friends there.

Yes, he is an undercon, but I had to share my story here :)

Best Regards,
