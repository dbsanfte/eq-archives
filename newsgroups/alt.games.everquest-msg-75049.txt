Bah!  Crowd-control in KC is one of the true joys of being a bard.  OK, 
it's one of the true joys of being a bard once you make level 53 and get 
the new mez song.  
Start practicing playing in 3rd person view now, since your role in a 
group is about to change.  Making level 53 allows you to imitiate a 
hyperactive enchanter.  Breaking a full handroom goes from really scary to 
pretty routine once you make 53.  Plus any caster that says 'Just play 
manasong' will get beat up by the rest of the group.
