Hehe, actually sound like a good idea. Up to people if they wanna spend a inventory slot on
carrying it around (need to weight 0 and 100% weight reduction so monks can use. Just make it
those runes only).
Need to be soulbound of course, so you keep the runes when you die. Might even make an extra
spot for the Velious Port tooths, so they can be in that box too.
