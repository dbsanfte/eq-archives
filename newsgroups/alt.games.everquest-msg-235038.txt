I am well aware of how knockback works, I keep a knockback stun mem'd
for the purpose of positioning mobs (most often to pull them out of
walls they've been pushed into).  The problem I mentioned has nothing
to do with where a mob is pushed, and everything to do with the fact
that it is pushed at all.  When a mob is knocked out of a PC's melee
range there is a delay compounded of latency in the visual effect (I
normally do not see the mob move until ca. 1 second after the spell
hits it) plus the reaction time of the player before the PC resumes
hitting the mob.  The reason I specified non-pet melee damage is that
pets stay on mobs just fine.  As for the other problems with knocking
mobs around (adds/healers), I have found that players using these
stuns in LDoN are not bothering to give a thought to them and often
don't even realize that they are the one responsible for knocking the
mob around.
