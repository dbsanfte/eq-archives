Lol, 500 mana, I wish!  Cleric pet cost 600 mana, and the bloody thing
suicides if it gets bored!

Further, when dead an epic level mage is almost certainly expecting a res...
which
means that his mana level is a moot point, its all going away anyway.  For
real preparation for a serious raid, a mage should make his epic summon,
drop the rest of his mana in rods, duel to die in the raid zone, eat rods to
recover
some of the lost mana, and make his epic summon, cast the pet, med
up, make the summon yet again, and then med back up.  With C2 that 1000
points of mana is going to be back before the clerics have finished buffing
everyone and recovering -their- mana to full, and the raid now has 3 epic mage
pets chain castable with no mana cost.  Whenever the mage dies, he
should again make an orb while awaiting res, what better use of that -soon to be

wasted- mana is there?  That and mod rods to every other dead person in
the area of course.
