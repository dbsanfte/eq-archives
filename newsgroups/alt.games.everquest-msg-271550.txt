First, you're correct in objecting to the obvious insult in my
sarcasm.  It was unnecessary, and more importantly ungracious.
I apologize and will try my best to discipline myself against
repeating the offence.

Second, you're not only incorrect but unintentionally ironic
in suggesting that I did not "make some argument on the issues."
There are exactly two ways to make truth out of your claim that:

'"Level" has nothing to do with "learning."'

One is to adopt a definition of learning that excludes
experience (let us not forget that "levels" are the product of
"experience" in the games under discussion, eh?).  This would
not only contradict the existing meaning and usage of the word
"learn", it would make it profoundly useless.  The alternative,
redefining the word "experience" to mean "quasi-magical coupons
you can cash in for cool power-ups!", is equally absurd.

I could be wrong, of course, but it seems to me that calling you
on advancing a statement that is plainly false as the crux of
your argument was much more important than responding in detail
to the snide little one-liners which you used to demonstrate your
incomprehension earlier.

Now, in the interest of fairness, I will admit that the games in
question mostly go with option two in the implied newspeak of
their implementations.  Perhaps that accounts for your confusion.
