Ouchie. Yeah, being a melee player really sucks some times. I don't
understand why the powers that be at VI thought the Gypsy camp (with
it's Griffawn and Griffene fly-bys every minute or two) was a better
place to be bound than the Bridge to SK. I'd much rather have a bind
point by some NPC's that will actually fight to protect you, rather than
some dumbasses who will just sit there and watch you get spanked over
and over again.
