Faned may be a complete fruitcake/wingnut when it comes to today's
politics but he's at least partly right about this one about WW2. The
United States froze exports of certain industrial items such as steel
and oil (and had other countries follow suit where it could), and then
froze all Japanese assets in the country in July 1941. Japan is
resource poor and couldn't maintain its chosen industrial state
without those resources. Faced with the choice of war or economic
ruin, they chose war.

That's just to start you out (the quote is at the bottom); a google
search for the right keywords will show you many many more.

That said, that doesn't make it "unjustified". Japan was already
invading sovereign nations before then and knew the European powers
were helpless to defend their colonies while Germany was undefeated.
The US could have ignored Japan, but Japan could not have ignored the
Pacific, and that would have led to US intervention at some point no
matter what. This is why the US froze Japanese assets in the first
place.

I don't know where Faned thinks Japan could have been toasted in six
months. That was never possible at any point, the US fleet wasn't
strong enough until much later in the war to undertake offensive
operations against Japan itself (US carriers in the Pacific were
outnumbered by Japanese carriers until after the battle of Midway when
Japan lost four of their best to the US's one). Recognizing this was
precisely the reason they targetted Germany first. Even at the *end*
of the war it would have taken months to take Japan alone and by
itself, disregarding the use of nuclear weapons unavailable in the
time in question of course.

Faned is wrong about "they never guessed how badly", though. Many of
the Japanese leaders were quite clearly aware of how much of a gamble
they were taking. In fact, Japan never really expected to win. They
hoped to win long enough that the US would get tired and let them have
the real objectives: Indonesia and China, especially if Germany won in
Europe. Total victory was never a possibility. Unfortunately for the
Japanese, they underestimated the US of the times.

Correct. This was proven in the Korean war, where NK and China were
not afraid to attack a nation supposedly under the defense of US
nuclear weapons (and the US did ponder using them when China invaded).
China and the Soviet Union have fought division sized battles while
both of them were nuclear armed, and India fought China while China
had nukes. Even now, today, its quite possible India and Pakistan will
fight some more. You can't defend a country with just nuclear weapons,
you have to have conventional stuff too.
