The one fact that saved all the servers economies from breaking down
and - at the same time - made the events fun for nearly all the
participants,
is that almost all of the drops where lore-items and no-drop.

There where some items not no-drop. Did you ever see those
in a shout? Not? Now imagine all the drops had been tradeable.
Go figure!

I think this made the events as good as can be.

Yeah, there is this occasional sucker, who will
kill the priest in North Ro within the minute he
spawns. But if that doesn't happen - let the event last one
hour and a huge lotta newbies gets themselves some cool
item or another...

For me, personally, the events could end right now
(do they end ON 5th of November, or AFTER?) since
yesterday, I finally got my Ring of the Ancients :)
All by myself! YAY!

But that's egoistic, so let the events go on, if they were
planned to - for another day.
