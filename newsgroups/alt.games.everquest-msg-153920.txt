Life needs its little hazards. Some people just need to find out what their
maximum is and then just back off a little. When using Cocaine (for
instance), it may just be a good idea to stop when your nose starts
bleeding.

I'm a firm believer in Darwinism. Back in the day, stupid people couldn't
have thrived. Eventually, they would do something terribly stupid, get
killed, and remove their flawed genes from the gene pool.

It is my belief that stupid people are a relatively new occurrence. Back
when life was dangerous, I think it's rather safe to assume some dumbasses
practically wiped each other out. "Hey, I'll go swimming during a
thunderstorm!" "Hey, I'll throw a rock at that sleeping tiger!" "Hey, with
the extended Warranty on my television, how can I possibly lose?" Dim-witted
ideas like that probably weeded out a great deal of stupid people before
they had a chance to breed.

I remember when I was young I had some roulette-thing that spun when you
pulled a string, and an arrow spun around until it pointed to an animal,
shortly followed by a sound associated with the animal. "The cow goes,
Moooo." Now since I wasn't a dumbass, I didn't manage to kill myself with
that toy. Sure enough, some other dumb child did. Rather than celebrating
the removal of horribly flawed genes from the pool, they made the toy nearly
impossible to kill yourself with. That was truly a sad day for humanity.

Overall, my point is that stupid people thrive in our society. It's too hard
to irradiate yourself these days because of all of the child proofing
measures that people go through. I think it has to stop.

(Note, this is written with a rather dark humour in mind. Hopefully someone
won't be offended by it...)
