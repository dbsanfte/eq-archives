I'm having the same problem with the flashing, but at the EULA screen, AND,
when I try to switch to full screen mode with F10, it crashes EQ.  I have an
ATI Rage Fury ( not a PRO ).  I went to download the newest driver, and it
also requires DirectX8, so I am downloading it, now.

I sure hope D8 works with Everquest.  I'm going to be a very unhappy
"camper" if it doesn't.

I love it when they patch things and it screws things up.  The only graphics
change I noticed in the patch was the one about being able to turn off some
spell effects.  I guess that could have impacted my video somehow.

I'm going to try to start the game again before I make any changes and take
it out of 1024x768 mode
