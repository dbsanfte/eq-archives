Without a doubt, the defining spell of clerics is complete heal.

Without a doubt, the defining spell of the entire game of Everquest is
complete heal.

The game would be playable without any form of rez.  A lot less popular, but
playable.  Without complete heal, the game would not exist in the form we
know it (not all would consider this a bad thing, but then some would like
seeing rez removed too...).  Every single "hard" encounter, going all the
way back to the base game, would have to be changed if CH disappeared, up to
and including a huge portion of the 1-group content.
