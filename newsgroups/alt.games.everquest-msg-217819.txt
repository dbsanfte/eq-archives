Yes and no, for subsequent iterations the seed is generally part
of the previous run of the RNG.  If thats whats happening here,
though, then a) they are using a really crappy algorith to
generate that seed and b) why does whether I change my facing or
not seem to affect streakiness?

I suspect they are using a combination of factors to generate
their "random" number, and that facing (which would yeild a
number from 1 to 360) is one of those factors.  Even then I can't
imagine an algorithm so bad that it couldn't continue to seem
random to the naked eye being designed in any way but
deliberately.  I think they -want- streakiness, as a
psychological lure.

Course that may be attributing maliciousness where stupidity
would suffice.
