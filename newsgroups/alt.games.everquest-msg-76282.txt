Hmmm, answer is maybe. There are spells that are available only through
research that you are going to want pretty badly. You may be able to get
someone with the necessary research skill to make the spell for you;
researched spells aren't no drop and most people who have put points into
reseach will hit combine for you if you ask politely and provide the
components. (Don't know what server you are on; I can help if you are on The
Nameless.) Keep an eye on both auctions and check inventories of vendors when
you're in town; I have found quite a few researched and dropped spells on
merchants. Also, research got easier for enchanters, mages, and wizzies
recently because all the formerly research only spells for levels 34 to 44
inclusive can now be bought off merchants in the caster guild in Katta
Castellum; spells for levels below 34 and for level 49 still have to be
researched though, so that doesn't help you with AoE Mez.

And I'll add a question to this. . . Can, say, an enchanter with high skill in
research make spells for other casting classes if they use the class
appropriate book? Curious because it would save me a lot of trouble if my
enchanter could buy a Book of Dark Bindings and make my necros spells for her.
. . Anyone ever tried this, or shall I experiment?
