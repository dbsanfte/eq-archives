Well, you have someone who you claim in monopolizing the spawn and not 
letting anyone else get the items.  Generally if something is camped you 
move on and come back when it's no longer camped.  In the case of a 
monopolized spawn, PNP is appropriate.  Of course the userbase generally 
takes a dim view on PNP on most servers, but in cases of extreme abuse PNP 
will be accepted even by your fellow players.
