pyramid@ftc.gov = [Pyramid scheme reporting to the Federal Trade
Commission] - E-mail address set up for the reporting of pyramid schemes
such as the one asking you to send money to each of the people on a list and
then place your name on the list asking others to do the same.

fraud@uspis.gov = [Fraud issues that need to be brought to the attention of
the United States Postal Inspection Service] - This address is another good
one to forward pyramid schemes to (as well as "pyramid@ftc.gov").

A few others to note...

Abuse reporting:

uce@ftc.gov = [Unsolicited Commercial E-mail reporting to the Federal Trade
Commission] - E-mail or newsgroup postings that is just normal spam, and
does not fit into any of the following classifications.

419.fcd@usss.treas.gov = ["419 Scam", needs reporting to the United States
Treasury for further investigation and action] - This address is for the
reporting of the scam where the sender claims to have acquired money
(usually in the millions, or tens or hundreds of millions of dollars), and
needs your assistance in transporting it out of the country, by use of your
personal or company bank account. They ask for personal information which
someone would have to be incredibly stupid or greedy to give out to a
complete stranger, even more so in the case of never having established
personal contact.

webcomplaints@ora.fda.gov = [Medical, dieting, or other products regulated
by the United States Food and Drug Administration] - Address for reporting
e-mails promoting medical products that you think might be illegal. (see
also "http://www.fda.gov/oc/buyonline/buyonlineform.htm")
