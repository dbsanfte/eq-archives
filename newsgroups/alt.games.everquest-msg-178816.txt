Not a bad idea at all. The stickler would be deciding whether it should 
be a simple rollback in time to the game as it existed before Kunark or a 
rollback of the available zones and level cap to 50. Think of all the 
spells that are post-old world that you would live without - KEI being 
the biggest for some people (personally, I wouldn't miss it).
