Got my Protection of the Cabbage quest done, and a nice earring to boot.

Lore, No drop, 5 ac, 5 sta, 8 wis, 8 int, 55 hp, 55 mana, 5 sv
fire/cold/magic, flowing thought 1. (yes, I took this over the druid
earring, I might do it again for both earrings, but not for a while)

End cost: ~4k cash, 21 Iron Oxides (bought off a gnome vendor in steamfont 3
months ago), 5 stacks of Silk Swatches (from a friend's DL hunting,
originally for my tailoring until I gave up after failing the 5th shawl) and
an assload of foraging in West Wastes (dragon eggs), Plane of Growth (planar
oak), and North Karana (wild cabbage and plain pebbles).

The cash cost would've been less, but I included that I paid a guy 500 pp
for a rez in Ocean of Tears after dying (in 54) from LD on my first solo
Allizewsaur attempt (had him too =/) when I was getting a Tackle Box for a
guy to do my fishing pole combine. (broken boat dropped me within track
range of Allizewsaur, and I decided to try him, got him second time though,
3 snake scales and a chanter page.)

Breakdown as follows:
Lotus Pie: 750pp
Lucky Cabbage: 6 (unimbued) plains pebbles and 7 wild cabbages
Misty Thicket Picnic: Made myself on first try =P (142 baking), 50pp or so
in vendor stuff, some foraged stuff and a couple brownie parts gathering
dust in my bank.  Still eating the other 3 that I have, great stat food,
especially since I compulsively forage and force feed.
Blessed Fishing Pole: free combine from my robe supplier, so 4 velium bits
(100pp, tempers), 4 sandalwood (350pp), 2 silk cord, 2 dragon egg oil, 2
branches of planar oak and 2 celestial essence(20pp) and he had a couple
imbued pebbles that I made the Blessed Dust of Karana from
Star Ruby Encrusted Stein: 2 Iron Oxides
Golden Idol of Tunare: 12 Iron Oxides
Mistletoe Cutting Sickle: 3kpp
Ceremonial Solstice Robe: 3500 and 5 stacks of silk swatches
Demi-sec Champagne: 300pp

Now, for those of you adding this up, yes, it adds up to more like 8-9kpp
and 14 Iron Oxides, but I sold the other 7 oxides for 3500 (not-quite-uber
guild outfitting themselves, with too much money on hand)

Plus, I traded my Necklace of Superiority (that I got as payment from a
port, heh) for an Orb of the Infinite Void.  Could've traded the OoIV for a
Wavecrasher a bit later, but preferred wearing the OoIV.

Oh yeah.  Level 54 sucks.

Note: please to be fearing my rambling pointless posts /nod
