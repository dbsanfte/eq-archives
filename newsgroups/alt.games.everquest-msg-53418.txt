I'm spending a lot of time in GFay right now, looking for customers
for my Fine Plate.  You wouldn't believe the number of people I've
spoken with lately who are of the opinion that I should make the
armour for them for free.

Cases in point:

A guy asked me to make him a suit of FP, and he offered to trade me
his suit of Banded for it.

One guy offered me 7 Plat if I'd make him a FP breastplate.

Another guy complained that I should be charging exactly the cost to
make the suit, rather than at a markup.  God forbid that I should
break even, let alone make a profit.

Some literally expect me to make it and give it to them.  Still others
feel that I should make it and either trade it for whatever junk they
have lying around, or whatever cash they happen to have loose.  

Today I had to append a statement to my looking for customers that no,
I'm not making anything for the beggars for free.  You wouldn't
believe how many shouts of approbation and agreement I got.  Some of
the beggars are *really* getting out of hand.
