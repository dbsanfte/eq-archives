True enough.

The only pots for which this is a danger (as far as I know) are halas,
erudin, and kelethin. Of those 3, halas is the only one where someone who
was KOS would automatically be in immediate danger. The others are
circumstance...guards are SOMETIMES there, but oftentimes they are not.
Although, clicking/running over a pot does not remove invis.

That of course, only covers the actual arrival point. All the pots (maybe 1
or two exceptions) have the obstacle that in order to leave the town, you
will have to walk past some guards. Thing is, there are only 3 classes that
will have problems here. Warriors, Paladins, and Clerics. Everyone else can
either invis or feign death (or both). Warriors with incarnadine BPs can
even overcome that obstacle.

I would give much to be able to bind there. After every patch, I go down to
the firepots and try to bind, just in case they screwed up and made the
zone bindable again.

I know several people, either directly, or through class boards, who have
been bound at the firepots for over a year (ever since kunark came out, and
have never changed it) who have NEVER been killed by Faydedar. The rarity
is hearing someone who has actually died. Fayd's long timer, short aggro
range, and even shorter lifespan all mean that a firepot bind is a pretty
safe bet.
