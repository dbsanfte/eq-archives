I've tried the flies near the zone-in in PoD.  I'm a level 60 Wizard, and so
far have just been doing them single.  I don't try quadding something until
I've done them single for a while, to get a good idea of what kind of
suprises they can pull.

Nothing I've read about them has mentioned their run speed being above
normal, but the impression I get is that they are faster than normal.
I have no trouble getting ahead of ones I've snared, but they just seem to
be closing faster, and when I start casting after running ahead, some times
I've expected to get a couple "out of range" messages, I've not.

On the other hand, there isn't a lot of room where I'm fighting, so maybe
I'm not really running as far as I think, and the speed is just an illusion.

I've watched other Wizards quad kiting them, and they seemed to be pulling by
just running through a group of flies to aggro them, and then running far
enough ahead to snare, and didn't seem to have trouble getting ahead.
