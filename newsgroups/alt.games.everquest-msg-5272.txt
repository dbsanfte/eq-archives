Geez, your GMs must be nice. A 50+ druid in my guild died and went offline
one day, and kept trying to come back to get her corpse, but the servers
were always down. (She's kind of a casual player) Her corpse rotted and the
GMs basically said, "tough luck" .. She asked if they could restore her from
a backup and they claimed there was no backup. (Sheeya, right.)
