I would go Focus items then Mana gear for the shaman. After you get canni
(somewhere in the 20's) you will want some hp gear as well. Mana usually
more bang for the buck early.
Get the human paly up to 100 STA then go AC/HP gear and a good weapon, maybe
a reaver 40/40 2hs with saves that usually sell pretty cheap and no level
requirements, get fastest 1hs/1hb/2hb you can find cheap.
Haste item for Beast & Paly. The difference between 21 and 31 is only 5%
faster since a 100% haste item only halves your attack speed. So go with a
cheaper haste item, you can get cash to upgrade later.
Never played a beast so not really sure what to suggest. But if you can
limit your twinking to 2 characters it would be best.

20K sounds like a lot, but if you can shop and take your time it will be a
lot more.

Of course I could be full of shite......................
