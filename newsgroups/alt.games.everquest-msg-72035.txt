I've already had that satisfaction.  Multiple times.  Now I find the lower
levels, without something to alleviate the downtime that I even complained
about back when it was a "challenge" to me, simply tiresome.  There is
definitely no challenge to the lower levels for me anymore.

For someone still going through those levels for the first time, sure, you
probably shouldn't have a fungi.  Of course you probably won't, either, so
it's kind of a moot point.
