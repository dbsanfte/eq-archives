Equal is not the same as equitable.  An equal, but exclusive, chance to
get lucky is also an opportunity to get screwed.  Ask somebody who has
watched phat_lewt_01 drop twelve times without ever winning the random
for it whether they think /random is fair.  Ask somebody who has had
this sort of luck in pickup groups, especially if more than once,
whether they want to see guild loot /random'd.  Fair is in the eye of
the beholder.

That is only true if the raid is viewed in isolation.  If your guild
raids regularly and seeks to strengthen itself by strengthening its
members it becomes hugely fair use weigh NBG, seniority, and merit
in loot distribution.  If your guild is primarily social and rarely has
guild-only raids (like the one I belong to) then it makes more sense to
distribute much of the loot via /random (even so, "can and will use"
often determines who is allowed to /random on a particular item).

If the mechanic that enforces seniority is one of the "point" systems,
that permits newer members to climb up the loot priority ladder it
becomes tremendously fair.  Likewise, if a guild is using "callout"
loot the responsible officers will consider who has been rewarded how
well recently if they want to build loyalty among newer members.
Another poster also mentioned passing upgraded items (I belive haste
items were used for the example) down to other members, allowing an
upgrade to benefit several members when appropriate.

Again, equal is not necessarily equitable, neither is it necessarily
fair.  Fairness is in the eye of the beholder, and obviously there
are quite a few EQ players who feel that /random produces unfair
results when distributing guild raid loot.  After reading what they
have to say I find that I agree with them.
