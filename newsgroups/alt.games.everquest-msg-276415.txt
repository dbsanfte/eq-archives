Although the city of Firiona Vie is held by "evils", the tunnels still
seem to be patrolled by the "goodies", so no surprise that your
characters got attacked. You'd be okay at the city unless you have done
something to damage your Venril Sathir faction.

You can try Maru Seru and take on stonegrabbers (I think they may con
up to Red) and aggro kite. I would recommend the flats near the Sanctus
Seru entrance as you get better visibility and fewer adds. Have Sow or
Jboots or something. If you have the lvl 24 necro pet you should have
no serious problems though keep an eye open for possible adds.

Also did Hollowshade Moor while it was a hotspot. Nice xp and not
difficult if your ISP is not trying to assasinate you. The first
pennisula SE as you come out of Shar Vahr is where I hunted. You will
probably find it a bit slow though and may want to hunt further east.

Unrest is supposed to be a hotspot through level 30 though I have not
hunted there.
