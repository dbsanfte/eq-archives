Well, you have to bear in mind is that this is Verant, so it was
probably poorly implemented :)

Historically, Verant has shown all kinds of links between seemingly
unrelated sections of code - these usually show up as unexpected bugs
in one aspect when they make a change in another. 

I'm no expert in API and DirectX coding myself, but I suspect they're
closely tied - enough to make this particular feature difficult to
disentangle.


By the way... what are they teaching CS students these days in terms
of computer languages? Have the schools caught up with reality yet and
started focusing on current languages?
