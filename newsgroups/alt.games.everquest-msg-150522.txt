I'd like to think of a smart-ass comment but somehow I'm too worried about
this boy to think of one.

This post is very disturbing.  This young man sounds very confused and very
unhappy.  Threats of suicide should ALWAYS be taken seriously.  This boy has
reached out to you, albiet in a bizarre way and you (and others) need to do
what you can to help him.  If you don't and something were to happen, think
how terrible you would feel.  I would think under the circumstances, with
bad press still hanging over SONY and possible law suit from last years
suicide, that a situation like this would be taken seriously by SONY staff.
I would petition this experience and send e-mails with logs to SONY right
way.  I'm not sure what they can do, but through account records they may be
able to contacts this boys parents.

If you talk to him again in-game, please encourage him to talk to his
parents and seek help through a school counselor, clergy member, a friends
family or even a crisis hot-line.

Several years ago a young man killed himself on a hospital psych unit my
husband was working on. He brought a gun on the unit when he returned from a
visit home and before it was found, he had killed himself with it.  My
husband recalls the look of shock on his face, as if he couldn't believe
what he'd done.  It only takes seconds.

His suicide threats are warning enough, but coupled with his erratic
behavior this boy sounds like a ticking time-bomb.  Please take this
seriously, please help this boy any way you can or he could very well be in
a box in the ground before this thread cools.
