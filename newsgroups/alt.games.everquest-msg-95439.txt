You could have stopped here, we got your message. :)

Beggars are no worse now than they were 2.5 years ago.  The attitude that
needs changed is yours 'cause there ain't no way you'll change theirs.

Ignore them, make a witty/cutting remark, make a morally superior remark,
trick them into typing /d...any of these are fine.  But the bottom line is
that they're here to stay.  If you feel you can't change your attitude it's
probably time to change games.
