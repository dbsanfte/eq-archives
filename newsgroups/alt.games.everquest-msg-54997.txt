Last night I was in the EC tunnels sitting down. Had just lost pet
fighting a lesser mummy, and went there to med up, get a heal, cast new
pet and buffs, and med some more. Just then this Iksar comes up and
inspects me. (No biggie. I'm not one of those who cares.) Then he hails
me, so I stand up and address him. He's very polite and definitely
roleplaying, so I exchange a few pleasantries with him, and then he asks
if I might be interested in selling my weapon to him. (I carried a
bloodclaw stilleto.)
  I didnt' take offense, but I told him that sadly it was my only
weapon, so I could not sell it. He then offered me an exchange... 150
plat and a dragoon dirk. He put it up in the window for me to examine.
It has the exact same damage/delay as the bloodclaw, but it also has a
couple stat bonus on it, which mine does not. Mine has a proc, which the
dragoon lacks, but the damn thing won't proc for me anyway, and likely
won't for another fifteen levels at least, by which time I'm not going
to be stabbing stuff anyway. (currently level 10. Probably procs in the
25 range I'm guessing?) I thought, what the hell, and took the deal.
There were two guys there selling Steins of Mogguk, and sort of
competing with each other, and I wound up getting one for 100 plat. 
  So the bottom line is I essentially traded my bloodclaw stilleto for a
dragoon dirk, a stein, and fifty plat. I thought I'd made a pretty good
deal, but then I realized that I've never even seen a bloodclaw up for
/auction before, and really have no idea what they are worth. Did this
guy walk off laughing having really taken me to the cleaners, or did I
do ok?
  I guess it doesn't really matter. I mean I can go camp a couple more
of those stillettos if I really need to, but I'm just curious. What do
they go for on your server, and would you have taken that deal in my
position?
