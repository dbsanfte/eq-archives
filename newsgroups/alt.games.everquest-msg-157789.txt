There is a monk on Povar that was the first person on the server to get 60,
way back when.  We were in <zone deleted to keep my exp ground sekrit> last
night when he came wandering by with a group.  He said he was trying to get
to 65 by the end of the night.

He was anon, and I forgot to /con him, so I don't know how far he'd gotten.

Since there are already level 63s out there, I'm thinking that it's not
really that onerous to get to 65.  Or at any rate, not nearly as onerous as
it was to get from 50 to 60.
