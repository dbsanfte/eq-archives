I've been playing EQ with a 3dfx Voodoo3 2000 (16MB) card for about 18
months. Now, with the Luclin expansion, and with a little extra cash, I
figure it's time to upgrade my video card. I'm debating between an ATI
Radeon 7500 or 8500 or the GeForce3 and GeForce4 cards. If you're using one
of these four cards, please tell me exactly which card, which drivers and
any good/bad issues with that choice for playing EQ. Thanks for any input.
