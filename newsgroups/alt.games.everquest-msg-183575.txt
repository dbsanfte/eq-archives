I did a MQ for my Wizard as he was 30 and my Beastlord 49.
Everything was green but they were that much that I died on breakin.
Brought my Cleric on second Account there too and it was an easy place
to hold ;)
But, it took my 40 Minutes for all but SolA Part and 3 days with 6-8
hours per day to get SolA Part.
BUT... Staff is worth all the time ;)
