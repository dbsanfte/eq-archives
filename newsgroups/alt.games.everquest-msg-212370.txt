With the advent of POP, faction troubles are mostly a relic; pretty much anywhere you might want to
sell things or buy food or bank you are only a zone or two away from POK, where anyone can bank and
sell things and buy things, and only a couple more zones away from your home town which will have most
of the spells you might want to buy, if they aren't available from the library vendors in POK itself.

This is especially noticable for Iksar, who are more hated than trolls by a long shot...
