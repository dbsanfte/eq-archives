I'm always hearing experienced players lament the fact that a lot of younger
characters go through the whole EC, NRo, Oasis, LOIO (etc, etc) routine,
always just grinding for the best XP at the expense of learning tactics and
enjoying different zones.

Seeing as how I've more or less burned out on playing my wizard because I
was in the whole grind routine (presently doing the Oasis part of it,
when/if I ever go back to him), and haven't felt like playing him because
the grinding is boring, I've gotten curious...  What are the alternatives?
I didn't really enjoy the XP grinding my wizzie was going through, and I'm
rather afraid of going through it again with my two younger characters.  I'd
like to get all of my characters off that cycle and experience some variety,
learn some tactics, and see more of the world.

If there really are so many other better places to play, hunt, and learn out
there, would anyone mind listing them for me?  Where should my 15 Wizard go
to hunt instead of the orc highway?  What should my 6&7 cleric and ranger do
instead of the EC orc camps?  What should I do beyond that?

Thanks in advance.
