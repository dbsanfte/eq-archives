With regards to the old testaments, the translation process was made even 
more difficult as I understand it, due to the lack of punctuation, and 
spaces between words.  Depending on how you choose to string letters 
together, you can get interestingly different interpretations of what it 
says.  One of the big differences between Hebrew and English, is that all 
vowels in Hebrew are denoted with dots and dashes that are added to the 
consonants.  If they are not put in the text, some words that have 
totally different meanings are spelled the same.  Normally, in books and 
such, they are left out, and the reader knows which word is being used by 
the context.  I can't speak for the translations of the New Testaments.
