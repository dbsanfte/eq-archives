Where above do I accuse you of not being able to thing by yourself? I may 
be developing the impression that you are just parroting right-wing 
doctrine without the benefit of any actual first-person knowledge, but as 
far as I can read the exchange, it was you who first brought up the point 
of Europeans not being able to thing for themselves by virtue of living 
under "nanny governments". I only pointed out that, in my experience of 
different European countries, this is a profoundly ridiculous statement.
