Heres how you can and probably should do it to maximize profits.

First get a fishermans companion the parts for the quest run a total
of about 300pp on my server, but it may be more or less depending on
where you are.

Second, make sure to get INT or WIS maxed out, get a KEI if possible. 
You need this to get skill-ups as fast as possible.

Third get CHA up as high as you can this will influence in a BIG way
how much is payed for your stuff.

Fourth make sure to use ONLY Catch-Alot-Bait, using it and the
Fishermans Companion you can expect to see a HUGE increase in the
amount and sizes of the fish you catch.

Fifth buy 10 stacks of bait, at a time, no more and no less.

Then fish through ALL 10 stacks of bait, and sell EVERYTHING you
caught.  If you can make some bbq tuna in the process put it on your
bazaar mule, and have him selling it, it goes for about 100pp on my
server.  But otherwise sell it all.

I do this EVERY morning when I login, and make 1kpp it takes slightly
longer than 1 hour, my fishing skill is 150 now, but I started with a
fishing skill of 20 I have been doing this a little less than a week,
and I only fish about 1 hour per day.  I'm getting skill -ups just
about every-other time I cast.

Also after you sell hunt 1 or 2 Turepta Cragwalkers, or Stone Mites, 
eventually they WILL drop an FT 1 or 2 item can't rightly remmeber
which, but I sold this item on my bazaar mule for 50kpp.  I have
gotten three of these in the 4 days I have hunted, it seems to drop
off about every tenth or so kill, and appears to be completely random.

Doing this you can make upwards of 1kpp per hour, but adding in the
sales of the hunt/kill or tradeskill items, I would estimate it
averages out to over 10kpp per hour spent doing this.  I don't know
what everyone else is able to achieve but a guildy of mine, is doing
this for 1 week longer than me and is now running around with a horse
and some awesome items, 2 weeks after having lost his corpse
completely, which had all his cash and items on him.

Also one more thing, foraged items in this zone are AWESOME, for the
amount of cash they bring in, if you happen to be a class with forage,
you will add about 25% to the amount of cash you make here and in
Abysmal.


One guildy is fishing while foraging, doing it almost exactly how I
said, and makes about 1.5kpp per hour (I just wish gnomes had inate
forage at this point).

So anyways, have fun, and yes there is a TON of plat to be made in
Natimbi, and I seriously hope to hell Verant does not nerf this.
