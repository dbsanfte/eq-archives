Why?  I'd expect it to poof unless someone did a point
of "real" damage at some point.   Mobs don't poof just
because the "kill shot" was a damage shield.

Yes, but I still don't see the issue.

Rains -- attributed damage or not -- are obviously different
from other spells.  They can be resisted on each wave, unlike
DoTs (AFAIK anyway).   All I'm saying is that it would seem
likely the "mechanism used to 'cast' waves after the first'" is
unique and was treated as NPC damage by the code.
