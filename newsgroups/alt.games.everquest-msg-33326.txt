Let me repeat a request I made a while ago: My halfling druid on Xev,
Rosewhite Blossom, is buying plains pebbles for 1pp each. If you can imbue
them so they stack, I will pay 25pp per stack. Look for her or one of my
occasionally played alts (Witte - human monk, Jumjumm - halfling rogue, Tvon -
erudite enchanter, Trenton - barbarian shaman).
