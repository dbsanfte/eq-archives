These aren't really GM style events. They're on a timer (WC was every
three hours), and it's a monster/loot table change. The monsters were
regular monsters, by which I mean it was the normal AI behind them.
They didn't display any living intelligence. For that matter, though,
neither did most of the players in the zone.

But that's another rant, that I already made elsewhere.
