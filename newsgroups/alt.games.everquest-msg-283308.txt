No, if you want to be EP flagged you need the *flags*, having access to the
zones doesn't matter (i.e. by level or by alternate quest), you need the
legitimate flags to actually zone into the EP's.

The list I posted are all the mobs you need to kill to get EP flagged,
*unless* someone else gimps you into the EP's and flags you that way.

The BoT progression flag is completed via a quest in the Plane of Storms.

>HoH trials 1-3 meaning 1-3 groups?  or trials 1-3?

Trials 1-3.
