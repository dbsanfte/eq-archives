If you don't group with a druid or enchanter it is tough. You have to just
pick off the the one or two on the outer fringes that won't draw a crowd.
There are spots like that that I can recall off hand, Steamfront Kolbolds
and Misty Thicket Orcs. You can lead them to guards to help you break the
camp, but you will spend to much time zoning and running.

It always causes aggro. What I did to get through the tough times was hunt
near a zone line and target monsters going away. You can cast at the limit
of your range and bolt will follow the monster outside your normal range. If
it was blue, just 2-3 bolts or maybe a lower range faster casting spell
would get them under 20%.  If it was white or yellow, two bolts and root,
then try to finish it off before root broke.

You cast, *RUN* backwards while the icon gets reset, stop and do a 1/8th
turn to let the server know you aren't moving, and hit the spell icon. If
you get good at it, you can actually get 4 spells off before the monster
hits you.

Simply put, your root at level 9 sucks. There is no way to make it better
other then by gaining levels.
