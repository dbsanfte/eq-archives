At 26 you don't have your first ports do you? (I don't recall). The portal
system makes for convenient and low-mana travel (My druid is bound there and
when he needs to go somewhere will often as not Gate to PoK and use the
portal instead of teleporting) and is still of use for questing after you
start getting your ports.

You'll only get Tiny Companion as a new spell at your level, but you'll need
PoP to get 'Spirit of Ash' and 'Share Form of the Great Wolf' which are
spells you'll actually want later.
