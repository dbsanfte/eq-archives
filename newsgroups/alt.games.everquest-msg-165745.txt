 Ugh, Grieg! Please don't say that name around me. It causes seizures.

 I'm not sure I can agree with your last statement though. At least not
as a take it or leave it statement. Each expansion trivializes the one
that existed prior to it. PoP is no different.

 As for Tunare. She was fairly easy pre-PoP. However that was due to
Verant perma-rooting her. She was really gimpified at that point. Doing
her pre-perma root change was a challenge.

 Well they don't really have a choice. If you want advancement you have
to trivialize older content in some respect. That's one of the main ways
for making encounters more challenging. Verant just hopes that people
leave older content alone once they move on.

 Well the idea is that once people get into PoP and work their way in
deeper they wont be farming the old content anymore. Guilds that are
outfitted in VT gear really should think about leaving mobs like AoW
alone.
