ROFL, now that is the Paul Phillips I remember.  Full of crap as usual. 
The name of the Avault forum, which was listed under their heading on
the NNTP server "forums" was forum.everquest.  This has now changed to
everquest forum which is listed under the heading of Adrenaline Vault
Hosted Forums.  Not sure which part of that makes it not a forum, but if
you say so it must be so.  Posting here before me has no relevance
regarding your status as a prick, the content of your postings then and
today does.  My dick size has nothing to do with it and I think everyone
here would prefer that it not become a topic of discussion.  If you are
really interested I could probably send you some .jpgs that would knock
your socks off though <EG>.  When you posted there were you this much of
an idiot?  That might explain why you were forgotten.  I still speak
daily with many of the old gang from f.eq, I guess we just never noticed
you.
