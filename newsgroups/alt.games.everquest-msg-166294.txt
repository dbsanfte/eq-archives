    Try the green guards at high keep. Drop up to 4pp each and a fs
shortword apiece, which is also nearly 5pp sold.

    If there arent any green guards at 30 go and grind to 35 ;)

    If you want money hunt green stuff that gives good money. Anything else
= some kind of downtime. Hill giants give great loot but not so great loot
when you have to split it amoung 5 lvl 30 toons and die 1 in 10 fights
anyway.

Cheers,
Kul
