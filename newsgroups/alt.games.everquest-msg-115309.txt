this is all relayed to me by my wife.. I do not raid on week nights
for this very reason...

Well.. two nights ago my wife was invited to help some friends out on
the Druid Epic.... It appears they were to kill the Dragon in TD
(fayed?)  
Now, before the raid all casters were instructed to bind outside of
the cave... Wife, a 52 Wizard, didn't want to but did as instructed
because she had never been here before... as did numerous others....
Well it appears this Raid consisted of about 3 full groups who were
mostly under 55... (first mistake, Dragon is level 60)... and they had
ONLY 2 clerics....   
Needless to say things went south real quick, and it appears this
dragon will continue to aggro all around it for quite some time...
Every caster that bound themselves outside of cave, were sequentialy
summoned and killed.... and summoned and killed, and summoned and
killed and.... need I say more...   Wife had 3 corpses herself before
She just turned off her computer.

Well.... in the end, the Raid leader petitions to ask for help....
because none of the corpses are reachable..

Guide/GM01 (i'm not sure which)..  in raid chat...  " Holy,... I've
never seen so much carnage"

  it seems that there were Numerous multi deaths... a couple hit the 6
corpse mark if I understand correctly... of course none of the non
binding classes had more than one... lol

Guide/GM02 " this is awefull... who the heck was incharge"

f I understand correctly the Raidleader got sorta an ass
chewing/lecture.

It appears this raid will go down as one of the biggest F'ups on the
server...

Just wanted to share... this happend on the Quellious server.
Lesson learned:  If you dont feel good about doing something... you
might not want to do it....
