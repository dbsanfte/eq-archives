Maybe so, but im not prepared to camp it knowing so many people would be
prepared to walk all over me and jack my mob after a huge ass camp.

I did a shitty camp last week, 1 hours sleep in 2 days, 16 hours of work,
every other hour camping the mob.. he eventually died less than 2 hours
before I got home from work on day 2.

There wasnt a chance of me getting FCFS'd cuz its a handin.. but i was
absolutely gutted with the events.. (also extremely pissed with myself, for
still putting myself through that kindof shit for a damn game again)

Rage camp... no thx!

Im also not comfortable or happy with jacking small guild clerics epics..
I've only ever lead a Rage raid once, a really good friend (cleric) in a
tiny guild spent every minute of every day in SF for 2 weeks, and got FCFS'd
twice.

The next time he popped I spoke with my guild leader and he let me take
everybody to SF (we were a few mins from a raid pull too)

In the time it took me to run from the wizard portal to the druid portal (Id
say 1minute 30 seconds max including zoning time - we were the first group
to port there) there were 40+ guildies in the zone.. needless to say amidst
the confusion of 3 guilds and 2 alliances racing for Rage, we were looted
and out of the place before they were even at his spawn spot.

Some of these smaller guilds I've either got good friends in, or helped them
with raid pulls etc.. seeing big guilds shit all over them isn't what I
wanna see.
