They "nerfed" the drop of the Royal Velium armour so it only drops of a few
mobs rather than all the dwarves in icewell, I've not seen any available for
loot when I've wandered thru there and neither have I ever seen anyone
asking to loot any.

Does the Royal Velium have a different graphic to plate?

I sympathise with you on the human plate helm, it does look terrible (my
friend compares mine to Post Office Pillar box and does emotes about posting
letters)

If you can get hold of Royal Velium armour, do so, it's quite heavy but
better than Crafted in AC and stats.
