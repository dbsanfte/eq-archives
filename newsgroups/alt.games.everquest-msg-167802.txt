Pretty much.

CoV = Claws of Veeshan. Its the faction most the lower dragons in
Velious are on. You get that up you can go to Skyshrine freely and
won't be killed by *most* (not all) of the dragons in WW.

Guilds on CoV faction farm the Halls of Testing (HoT) in Temple of
Veeshan for their velious class armor.


>What other guild factions are there?

As far as velious goes, you're either on CoV, on giant (Kromzek), or
happily hosing both.


>  What guild faction is most common and
>why?

CoV is a little more common because people are always killing in Kael
anyways. It's a pretty close race though.


>  What places will this faction mean that I will miss out on?

It means you won't be doing one wing of ToV, and won't be farming
dragons in WW unless you feel like repairing faction afterwards.
