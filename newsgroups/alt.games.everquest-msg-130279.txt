It probably depends on the zone and what you are doing.  For example, I've
went LD running from a mob in OT, and survived just fine.  Kunark mobs give
up chasing you after a fairly short distance compared to Old World mobs, and
I happened to be running in a direction that had no obstacles to stop me for
quite a while, so I probably simply got away from the mob.  When I got back
in, I was way out in the ocean.

On the other hand, last time I went LD was in EW.  I'd just gathered some
mobs to try a multikite, and stopped to snare them.  Looks like I went LD
while casting the snare, so I died, since I wasn't moving when I went LD.
