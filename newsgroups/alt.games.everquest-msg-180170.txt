Theres alot of debate on this, on the validity of a battle cleric. If
the cleric can still perform his or her duties and keep the group
alive, whats wrong with contributing to the battle? Ive not actually
played with a cleric with this mindset, so I cant really argue the
pros and cons of it. Id be a little nervous if I saw the cleric jump
into the fray, but its got to get so dull sittin on your butt only to
stand to heal. *shrugs*

Because the monthly fee cant cover development costs of a large
expansion. You accuse me of not reading your post, did you read MY
response?

"None of these expansions should cost subscribers anything."  ....
sounds pretty free to me considering the process it takes to make an
expansion and considering the monly fee covers server maintenence,
live team salaries, other free content (such as a few free zones) and
constant updates (as i said).

Then you should be aware of the costs involved. Personally, im not
involved in such a pursuit, Im a database developer and am aware of
the costs it takes to maintain our server farm, which is small
compared to thiers.

Of course they dont HAVE to get them all up front or at all really.
You can pluck down 10 bucks and get playing with a free month. Dont
try to argue that you cant do this because you can. Damn cheap if you
ask me. They want more? They gotta pay like the rest of us. Wish I
could have started playing this game for only 10 bucks, and at that -
they are getting more of thier money's worth then when the rest of us
started. Heck, for the price of a new computer game, (EQ gold 49.99 at
the sony store site) they get it all - all current expansions, so
essentially they CAN get all the expansions for "free".

Its hard to say which game really put MMORPG's into the mainstream (if
one can say its even to that point yet). Certainly UO (which i played
as well) put MMORPG's on the map. My point was that the more money any
MMORPG's make, the better the future is for up and coming MMORPG's. As
Im sure you know, its the moolah that drives business and MMORPG's are
a business.
