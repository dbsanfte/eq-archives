I like people who just toss out a question mark as some sort of response to
something I said.  It gives me the excuse to answer with an exclamation mark
and wander away. :)

Or people who say "what?" so I hit shift-up-arrow and send the message out
again.  Well, ok, that particular one is kinda cruel 'cause it's not like I
don't say it on occasion and I know what they mean, but I like playing dumb
too. :)

I'll often not answer the question, "what level are you?" because I'm so
rarely hiding my info that you might as well say I never do.  I WILL answer
"what are you?" if the person asking is under 40...after all, it's possible
they haven't seen a gnome yet (if they're under 10 anyway) and may have no
idea that a "beguiler" is an enchanter.
