Just out of curiousity, how do you play so much and not get completely
bored with the game?

I played for 4 years, had one character at level 65, and had about
20-24 AA's. It got to a point where I simply could not log on for more
than five minutes without getting extremely bored -- edging near
disgust -- at playing the game. Grinding did nothing for me anymore.

Though admittedly, in the last week before my account expired, I spent
most of my time running around sightseeing in Velious, had a fantastic
time doing that. I really wish they would do more with the zones in
that expansion, they're really immersive.
