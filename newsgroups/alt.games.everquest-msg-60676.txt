Argh... I just had to remove a 256MB memory module I bought only a few
hours ago, to bring my machine up to the recommended 512MB for SoL. I
was getting *continuous* memory address errors, and the occasional full
system crash. So back it goes on Monday. >:(

After having used computers pretty much every day for the last fifteen
years or so, I think I'm qualified to say that they SUCK. This goes
double if they are PCs. And this goes double *again* if they are running
Windows.

/em blows off steam.

Bah.
