When you go to the advanced options, there's also a check for "optional"
files and zones and such. I had the same problem after a reinstall, and
had to do that. Check every box, including that one. I was getting naked
humans for many models that were originally added with The Hole, and
some types of giants. I wasn't hunting in Kunark at the time, so I'm not
sure if/what I was missing there.
