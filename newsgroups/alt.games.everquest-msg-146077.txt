THe problem is that not all the mobs at a camp are the same level. And
this problem isn't only for soloers but partner teams as well.

Case in point level 51 at spirocs, range from low (Lightfoot mostly
light blue) to medium (Watcher rare lt blue most dark) to high (Proven
all dark blue). You have to take what pops. Under this new xp system
you will get almost no xp from a LF at 51 which btw can be half the
mobs.
Most camps follow this same structure and to hold the camp you have to
be able to take on the highest mobs. Now you are killing up to half
the mobs for no xp( lightfoot) and part of the dark blues for reduced
xp (watchers) to get to the mobs that have no bonus or penalty
(Provens). 
Same camp as earlier this week only much less xp. Know this for sure
cause I was there last night (51) and xp was horrid. Night before the
patch I was same level (51 hell) and it was better, much better. Heck
give us back hell levels please lol. heh now if I can just find that
old copy of DAOC around here somewhere.....

To take a quote from and old movie "Your new system just plain sucks"
