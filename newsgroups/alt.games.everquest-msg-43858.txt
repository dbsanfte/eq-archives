Subject: Warrens at level 17 (and 14) where should we go next?

There are some "blues" here for me and my partner.  Unfortunately many of the
greens agro on him - he's level 14.  I don't get credit for the greens and they
dont drop teeth if he's grouped with me.  We cant kill alot of the blues
because of the terrible agro of the kobolds.  
We dont have tons of money... where should we go (where we don't have to port?)
(I'm a druid, he's a fighter)
I think this trivial loot thing sucks great big concord grapes....
