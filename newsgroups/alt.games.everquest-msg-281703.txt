Back a few decades ago, D&D had this same sort of scale thing going on, 
where indoors an inch would represent one distance (ten feet, I think) 
and outdoors it would represent a different distance (ten yards?).  At 
the same time, time itself passed at different rates indoors and outdoors.

You'll see this sort of thing in "real life" all the time, if you look 
at an atlas with a map of Rhode Island taking up a page, and Connecticut 
taking up a same size page, and Providence taking up yet another same 
size page.  Of course they don't use different time scales to compensate...

One explanation I read was that for archery purposes, with a ceiling in 
place, you could only shoot relatively short distances.  Thats not a 
very good explanation, even if you assume -all- ceilings indoors are of 
the ten foot variety, surely this shouldn't affect short and medium 
ranges, just the longest range... and why it would have a similar effect 
on magic spell ranges is even harder to fathom.

For time, I think the idea was that indoors you moved more slowly, 
paying more attention to your surroundings, while outdoors you could 
move more quickly as there was less detail to worry about.

At any rate, it did mean you could have a house 10 "inches" on a side, 
from the outside, and then inside have a 30 inch by 30 inch map for the 
DM to play with, without changing most of the other rules of the game.

If EQ uses a similar plan, then it would be possible for a "unit" of 
distance as given in weapon ranges or spell ranges to match up 
consistently to a "unit" of distance as calculated in grid coordinates, 
even though the actual "size" of both unit systems changes from zone to 
zone.

So, zones not "fitting up" to the zones surrounding them might be a 
scale issue without affecting the scale for game play.

If this is true, the question would be is there -some- combination of 
scales at which the zones fit together?

You also have to take into account zone lines where you're moving down a 
passage or thru a narrow cut thru cliff sides; that "zoning" might 
represent a substantial distance traveled.
