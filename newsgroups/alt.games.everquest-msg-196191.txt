We already were remember the charm nerf?  KEI would be peanuts to us
comared to that.  AFAIK they took away 1/3 of our  leveling power with
that nerf, and took my one reason to play an enchanter that dies on
average every 2 or 3 hours.  KEI?  PLEASE take it.  If they took it away
it would HELP us.  We'd have to cast a different clarity buff more
often, but people would be more willing to group with us.  It would only
hurt the power leveling twinkies, and the soloists of high level.
