he doesn't want to download the game.  he wants to download the
PATCHES, so that when the game arrives, he can apply the patches
immediately.

basically, he wants to spend the hours NOW waiting for the patches to
download, rather than spending that time waiting AFTER the game
arrives.

but i don't think there's any way to do that.  i know that you can
download the current starcraft patch as an .exe file fron blizzard's
homepage, but i don't think sony/everquest has that option.
