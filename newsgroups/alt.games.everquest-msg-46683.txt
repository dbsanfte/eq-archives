A while back the printing dept. in the shop I work in was running a 3
day week.  Mon. - Wed. 5p to 7am.  with OT on Sunday night.  A little
coffeehouse up the street from us got VERY good business.  We would
send someone out (usually me) NIGHTLY for Latte's and Mocha Big Trains
(kinda like an Arby's Jamocha shake but with spunk).  On a nightly
basis I was was buying 8 to 12 drinks at $2.50 to $3.50 US and then
stopping on the way home to get a kick in the pants so I could stay
awake long enough to meet my GF for lunch.

MOST of the people that frequent coffee shops RARELY are 1 cup
drinkers either, especially if they are sticking around to drink it.
To spend 6 or 7 bucks at a javahut is not all that unusual, and yes,
that is usually 4 to 5 days a week for dedicated drinkers=)

The quote about buying a "$300 cappucino machine because it will save
you money ...." is priceless.  Think I will have to take a copy of it
down to the shop=)

As for the paying of Al's, although I havent done so yet - plan to
either this Thursday or Next - I dont have a big problem with it.  Nor
that of EQPrices.  I may not understand exactly what it costs for the
sites but I understand the value of the information therein.  Yes, the
info is player submitted but as another said, the delivery is not.
