I don't want to give the credit to DOS or to IBM, but rather to the 
whole conglomerate of DOS and the IBM+clones family; the "DOS machines". 
  Again as an end user, I know little about the differences in hardware 
philosophy that make certain software and OS things easy or difficult to 
implement... nor do I much care.

Doesn't explain the failure for the C128 to run C64 software, other than 
in crippled C64 mode.  If C128 had run C64 software as a C128, then 
perhaps that would have been a success, and perhaps there'd have been a 
C256, C512, etc.

Yes, thats true, but I was replying to your statement "If you define 
'best' as 'has the most market share', sure, but Windows
isn't the best in all areas."  The area I was interested in was not the 
market share, but the "stuff for me to choose from" aspect.  I think 
you'd have a hard time arguing that for the general user, Windows isn't 
the best in all areas of that.

Exactly my point.
