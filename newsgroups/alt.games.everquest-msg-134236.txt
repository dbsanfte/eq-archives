But then we are back to the issue that it's not up to the child to
decide when he or she is ready, but rather the parents.

My son said he was ready to drive at 12...  That doesn't mean he IS
ready..

Or just maybe, the PARENT isn't ready to explain...  :^)

I concede your distinction..  However, in the here and now, in
society, when you say AIDs, the vast vast majority of the public
thinks "Sex"...

Wrongly, to be sure.. But thereit is...

I would be very surprised to learn that "gay" as reference to
homosexuals, is used often in the pre-school environment.

4 girls out of the billions in the world does not a trend make.  I'll
grant you that there is an exception to everything I have maintained.
Probably quite a few exceptions..  But they ARE exceptions...

Not by 2 yr olds...

Not by 3 yr olds...

Maybe by 4 or 5 yrs old, kids will have some contact with it.

But then it begs the question, where does it end??

At what point do we, as responsible adults, say "That is NOT
appropriate for children."

Using the reasoning put forth, why do we have motion picture or video
game ratings?  Or warning labels on CDs??

If a child is old enough to load up a PSX 2, then surely he is old
enough to understand it all..


Why is there all this pressure to "grow kids up" so fast???

Can't we let them be KIDS at least until they are in school??

It's a cold rough world out there..  

Why is everyone in such a hurry to thrust our kids into it?  At the
expense of their childhood...

If you hit a child with all the bad at an age when they MAY not be
able to handle it, will they be able to grow up, seeing the good??

And that knowledge, once they possess it, can NEVER be taken back.
Once you open Pandora's Box to your child, they will never be able to
close it.

I honestly and truly don't believe we are doing the children of th
world any favors by making them grow up so fast..
