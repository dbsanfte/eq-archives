Ahh, who cares? Just a bunch of corrupt bastards anyway. Harassing and
killing honest merchants and those poor pallies. Completely
unrepentant.

Just get a group and start killing. Pretty good experience at your
level. (I'm sure there are better places, but West Freeport is easy as
long as you stay away from the gate guards.) The experience is even
better when you include the helmet turn in to the pally guild master.
The money is also good. You get from 2 to 10pp per each guard when you
include the money they drop, items they drop, and the value of the
helm turn in. Averages about 4-6pp if I remember correctly.

Duo with a Warrior or other Melee (or Even a strong Pet Class) and you
should be able to clear all the guards you can reasonably kill. (one
outside the militia house, one just inside, some near every zone line,
some that wander.) Then you can move to East Freeport and kill a few
more there, just watch out those in East Freeport are a lot harder to
get single, and some run to the gate guards while you are occupied
with the others. The guards in West Freeport also run to the gate
guards, but in East Freeport they are much more likely to make it
before you can kill them. Also in East Freeport there are three gate
guards. Two at the main entrance and one on the docks.

Besides, you make the Pallies and Clerics in North Freeport very happy
with you. You want to help your fellow clerics right?

Honestly I'm going to get a few more levels then come back and kill
every Militia in West Freeport (including the gate guards and quest
NPCs) and then rename it West Ceod-Port.

(I'm still on very good terms with the honest guards in High Hold and
Qeyenos, BTW.)
