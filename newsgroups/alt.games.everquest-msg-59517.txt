OK, being a Half Elf Paladin I started out as dubious with live (I also
rarely kill them, except in cases where one of my group members depsite his
naughty acts against them I consider his life of more importance than the
frogs :-) ), and have been hunting in Lguk since level 32.  Have probably
killed about 10 live froggies and about 1000? dead.  Last time I checked
faction with live I was kindly, but that was probably 100 dead frogs ago now
so quite possibly am warmly.  Of course, it has all just been exp for me,
which is not necessarily so for you Jakkugg :-).

Oh, and I finally got out of that damned lvl 40 (after dying 11 times in one
week, losing it 7 times, and taking me nearly a month to get through it I am
totally sick of it).  Already maxed the disarm that I got the same level :-)
(tho for Pallys it only goes to 70 :-( )..  I am just praying that I don't
die back into it :-/.

Anyway, IF you SERIOUSLY want to fix live faction (and I am sure it is
possible, troll or otherwise - not sure that there is any faction that
nobody can't fix unless there is no way to up the faction) then you have to
do some SERIOUS killing of dead ones. :-)  It really comes down to which is
the more nuisance - fixing the faction or putting up with being KOS.
