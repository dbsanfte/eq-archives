Also they start with a higher base wisdom than Barb if i am not mistaken and
the regeneration helps with the cannibalize spells.

Alot of what wou said could also go under the Shaman category as well with
regard to SOW.

1?  I disagree.  Enchanters can solo efeectively if the person playing them
knows the spells.  I've seen an enchanter take out a single equal level mob
with little difficulty.

Thats right but at earlyer levels i would prefer to be in a group till my
pet was a little stronger.

Atually i think his rating here is accurate.  Pallys may not be the best
fighting forse but their LOH can turn the tide of battle and they do have
the hp to stay in a fight.

I would have put their soloing abil at 3

I disagree, i play an Eru Shadowknight and i solo very well.  With lifetap
for the i can make it so i barely take damage in a fight which reduces my
sit time since i have to med instead of heal.

Minor thing but i would have to say troll as ideal race due to regen.

I think you are underestimating their group value.  while they are not a
tank, when grouped with somone able to take hits can be a great assistance
to a group.
