Credit cards are even easier, but yeah more institutions are treating them
more like credit cards.  I'm not well versed on the details of this topic
but I believe the biggest problem is (or perhaps "was" by now) that Visa and
MasterCard, Inc's agreement with financial institutions didn't give them the
same protections.

Ok, now you have me curious...going afkas to ask our Operations dept. :)....

Ok, turns out I should have asked BEFORE I posted. <g>   Bottom line is
this:

In the case that I responded to, opening a checking account and keeping JUST
enough money in it each month to pay for EQ:
- It's less inconvenient to use a credit card than a debit card if you're
worried about the number being stolen, but not by much.

If you have both a debit & credit card, but you're actively using that
checking account to pay, say, your mortgage, a credit card is MUCH less
inconvenient if stolen, unless you have some really understanding creditors.
<g>

In either case there's a fairly good possibility that you'll get your money
back, except for possibly $50 (usually waived).

For phone sex and porn sites it's usually very simple to get your money back
quickly, whether debit or credit cards.

Though with debit cards you MAY have to wait up to 10 business days (2
weeks) before getting PROVISIONAL ("we're assuming you're telling the truth
until we know for sure") credit on your account.  It's a lot less
inconvenient for credit cards.  In the case of porn you're probably not an
exception to the rule, it wouldn't surprise me if most financial
institutions gave you provisional credit immediately because they almost
always get credit back from the porn site and phone sex companies.

I did also get verified (totally off topic) that you're not actually allowed
to rent cars, buy plane tickets, or reserve hotel rooms with a debit card,
as per Visa/MC rules, though that rule appears to have no teeth in it.
