Actually, it's not stupid at all.  It's known as the "right-hand-rule"
for maze solving, and it's an old, old technique.

From http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/quantum_computer.txt:

  Let's imagine a problem:  we need to find a path through a
  complicated maze.  Every time we follow one path, we soon come
  across new branches.  Even knowing there is *some* path out, it
  is easy to get lost.  A well-known "algorithm" for walking a
  maze is the "right hand rule"--follow the right hand wall until
  you are out (including around dead-ends).  This may not be a
  very short path, but at least you will not repeat the same
  corridors.  In computer terms, this rule is also known as
  "recursive tree descent."

More technical treatment at: http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/algrithm.htm

   Wall follower: This is another simple Maze solving algorithm. 
   It focuses on you, is always very fast, and uses no extra memory.
   Start following passages, and whenever you reach a junction always
   turn right (or left). Equivalent to a human solving a Maze by 
   putting their hand on the right (or left) wall and leaving it 
   there as they walk through. If you like you can mark what cells 
   you've visited, and what cells you've visited twice, where at 
   the end you can retrace the solution by following those cells 
   visited once. This method won't necessarily find the shortest 
   solution, and it doesn't work at all when the goal is in the 
   center of the Maze and there's a closed circuit surrounding it, 
   as you'll go around the center and eventually find yourself 
   back at the beginning. Wall following can be done in a deterministic 
   way in a 3D Maze by projecting the 3D passages onto the 2D plane, 
   e.g. by pretending up passages actually lead northwest and down 
   lead southeast, and then applying normal wall following rules.

This image: http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/sample/follow.gif
shows how the right-hand-rule traverses a complex maze from the
"entrance" in the lower right to the "exit" in the upper left.
The red path is the "shortest route", the gray paths are "side trip"
areas that are not necessary, but still traversed by the algorithm.

The same page describes 10 other methods as well.
