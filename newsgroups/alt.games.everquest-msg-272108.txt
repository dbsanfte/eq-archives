Lance explained it very well...

My 61 Cleric has 258 WIS, 3700 mana MAX Med skill, and FT6

That is sufficient to get through most LDoN addys and most XP groups
without a mana break...

But it isn't enough for Raiding where more pulls happen and more
damage occurs to the tank more often. For these he needs KEI and SA/SD
for mana regen; and even then will go oom after about 10-15 pulls.

In my observation, a lot depends on the Tank too. If the tank can keep
agro and dosent panic easily I can use CH's which are easy on the mana
pool. If he cant keep agro then I have to heal everyone else and those
smaller quick-heals drain mana very quickly.
