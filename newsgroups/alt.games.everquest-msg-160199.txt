Are you the guilds highest smither?   If somebody else is near/higher.. you
should hope it doesn't drop any time soon - it seems pretty rare, and you
just blew all your merit on one of the best cleric shields in EQ :)

Well theres no real need for you to know.. not worth worrying about
haste/weapons etc.. the only time any of it should matter is if you are ever
the one to decide cheal pauses and healing strats

The people who were "stealing" rampage were actually higher on the rampage
list than your ramp tank.  He got rampage back when they ran out of range
(to get a heal I guess).. and when they ran back in range, he stopped taking
rampage.

If 4 people on rampage ran out of battle briefly, then the 5th would get
rampaged.. typically 4 people wouldnt all be out of range for long though,
so that would explain getting rampage once.

Last time we did HP I was on rampage (the last 1 had died so I knew it wasnt
a range issue) so I called it, then stepped out of battle and said it enough
times to make sure the heals started on me, before stepping in.   Others
were getting rampage after i did that, but the very moment I stepped back in
I knew Id take all rampages

How about first broods, Sleepers, tormax/statue, Yeli and the other
"stepping stone" mobs?

I was with my guild from vindi days and before, and Im glad i was because I
didnt skip any of the raiding tiers on our way upto aow farming, ssra named
and beyond
