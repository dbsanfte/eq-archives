I usually keep the victim rooted and the pet targetted, and sit at a slight
distance. You can then either mez with lvl 4 mez before recharm (and not
much wait this way), or just fire off charm before it gets to you. Soloing
is easy, it just sucks for xp.
Also if you have snarer in party and /duel them, then they can cast snare on
your pet.
