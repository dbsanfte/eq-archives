!!! Is this true?
no wonder its taking an age to level my necromancer. I cant think of a way for
my pet to not outdamage me though because he hits everytime for around the
strength of my DD's and i dont want to exhaust all my mana on 1 mob. I need my
pet to take the aggro while soloing which i do 90% of the time. Any suggestions
on how i can stop my pet getting the exp?
