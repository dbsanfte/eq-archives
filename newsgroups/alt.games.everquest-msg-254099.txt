I hear you. Even though I learned to drive on a manual car, I drive an 
automatic, which makes me a bit of a pariah here in Europe; but, while 
I'd love to have more control as to when the car shifts gears, the 
clutch, frankly, can kiss my arse.

I wish I could afford one of those fancy cars with gearboxes that 
basically give you the advantages of both. :(
