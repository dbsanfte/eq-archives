Hi everybody,

I will be reloading my boyfriend's XP operating 
system from scratch, and he wants me to save 
his Everquest setup and transfer it to the fresh 
XP load.  

1.  Can I save his game and his "maps"?
    I can burn a CD if needed.

2.  Can this be transferred to a (in effect) 
    new computer?  

3.  Is this done through Everquest commands, 
    or must I manually transfer files?
    If so, what are the commands /or/ files?

Thanks a bunch,
TankGirl
