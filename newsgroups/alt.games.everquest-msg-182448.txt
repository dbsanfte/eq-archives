Ok, it's an old post again, but having become recently KEI-enabled, I 
gotta throw in my two cents.

So I scribed the spell and ran to nexus in pursuit of the phat lewt that 
awaited me.  I sent up my little '/o KEIing by Larren, hail me' and was 
instantly swarmed by a mass of people all hailing me at once, and trying 
to invite them all and get the spell cast and remember who'd hailedme 
while the spell was casting and argh!

I found it very stressful.  I did rake in about 300pp in about 10 minutes, 
just off that one /ooc, but I couldn't take it and had to flee.

It has always been a point of pride to me to not be /anon or /role.  But 
I'm just going to have to give that up.  And note, just because I am in 
nexus and have snake stick in my hand does -not- mean I am KEIing for 
donations.  If there's 8 people begging for KEI in /ooc and I -haven't- 
said I'm KEIing, that does not mean I wish to have a conversation in tells 
with each of those 8 people individually about why I am not.  I -may- be 
in a group that's buffing up to port somewhere and actually hunt.  I may 
be having a private chat with a close friend.  Both of these experiences 
are not enhanced by my screen going purple with tells.  

Strangely, though, I'm still more likely to respond with KEI to a personal 
tell, escpecially if you're in range and con at least l1ght blue.  The 
annoying part is that they all seem to think I'm not reading the /ooc, or 
by god, I would have helped them by now.  And the other annoying part is 
the not taking -no- for an answer part.

I dunno how the people I see in there KEIing for donations day in and out 
can stand it, personally.  I'd say their reward is well-earned.  An eager, 
KEI-hungry mob is at least as scary as a charm break.
