Yeah, I don't complain.  I'd much rather get 40 heals when I don't need them
than not get one when I do.  I don't play my cleric much anymore, but when I
did it was nerve wracking grouping with necromancers and shamen.  I
eventually just set a 50% rule.  If you get below 50%, I'm going to heal
you.  If you need a heal before then, you'll have to ask.  This works well
in LDoN, and natually if I saw someone getting beat on, I'd heal them.

Like I said the only solution is to group with the same healers and
eventually you will get a feel for each other's style.  Of course it is
mostly the necromancer's resposibility to keep her health up.  Know how many
hits you can take from the mobs you are fighting and what your options are.
In a hard LDoN where mobs hit for 980s, I can go from 100 to 0 in a few good
rounds.  So if I am getting hit, fd right away.  There isn't much I can do
to help the group if I am real dead.
