I think it's more a matter of how much the faction hits will effect
you in other places.

If you hunt iksars, the faction hits won't make a bit of difference,
especially as everyone but iksars start out KoS anyway.

You can also hunt erudites either side, without killing your faction
elsewhere. In fact you are expected to kill heritics/faithfull(?)
depending on which side you choose.

In qeynos, you can kill corrupt guards and actually improve your
faction with the rest of the city IIRC. On the other hand, if you kill
your faction with the good side, you can still walk the streets safely
in Freeport.

Also in Freeport you can kill the Millita without hurting faction
elsewhere.

Also it might be the Devs trying to encourage people to break the
mould and hunt in cities that don't see as much use.
