Sorry, I don't believe your version of the events without some
evidence from a non-biased and reputable source.  I'm happy to be
proven wrong, but I'm not interested enough to do the research myself.
If you feel like passing some URLs on at some point, that's fine.  If
not, that's fine too.  (It doesn't help that I have the flu and I'm
sporting a 102F temperature.)  What did sick people do before the
Internet anyway?  :)

Of course.  Any sane human being would prefer surrender over
armageddon.
