I personally didn't find it my cup of tea. (was in their first 'stress 
test', they are going to have more).. among other things the movement 
system is a 'click and you walk there' type thing, you can't control 
your character without a mouse. The reason is they claim they can do the 
pathfinding more efficiently on the server than  you can on the client. 
or some such BS. They will only have one world, period. Everybody on one 
massively powerful server (it's a blade server rack, looks pretty).
