I would like to know if anyone else has experienced or heard of problems
with the EQ Trilogy. And would like suggestions for solutions to this if you
have any.

I have an AMD 500 Mhz computer with the Voodoo 3 PCI video card. Bought the
original EQ game a few months ago in the little mini-pack for $9.99. I have
had no problems at all and the 3D-accelerated graphics look fine. I bought
the EQ Trilogy so I could venture to Kunark and Velious. Installed the
Trilogy, logged in, and the graphics are horrible. It looks like the game is
not even using the 3D hardware acceleration of my video card (even though
Everquest says "3D Hardware Acceleration required"; kind of like playing
Quake II in software render mode. I have already downloaded new drivers for
my video card,but didn't help. Here is the really weird part. I uninstalled
the Trilogy and reinstalled Everquest classic from my original CD and it
still looks like crap! What the heck. Does the Trilogy change some registry
setting that relates to EQ that I can't get changed back? And it's not my
video card malfinctioning, because Aliens v Predator  2 looks great.

Also, I installed the Trilogy on a friends computer that is similar to mine
(PIII 450 with TNT2 card) and the graphics look just as crappy on his.

Any suggestions or explanations would be very appreciated.

PS - I have called Sony Online's customer service line 3 times and it just
rings, and rings, and rings. No answer. Great customer service guys!
