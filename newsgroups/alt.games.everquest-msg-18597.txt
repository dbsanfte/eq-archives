The top floor stuff is white to my 11 Bard. Been told 3rd floor is 25ish at
most. Your necro will be just fine, my 16 chanter held the first section on
the right (two rooms with the fallen bookshelves) on his own for half an
hour. And these days, the place is still crawling with 30s and 40s checking
for rare loot, so they'll normally help with buffs and stuff.
