Find a free source for how to make big platinum in EQ, copy it, scraping 
off the serial numbers, and put it up as a web site, requiring pay 
access to get in and take a look.

For extra cash, record the email addresses of everyone that does so, and 
sell them to one of the many (heck, all of the many) companies out there 
which are eager to buy email addresses of people foolish enough to pay 
for information which is available for free.

To start your web site, I reccomend including
<kvednRXpZu71IqncRVn-sg@dejazzd.com>
which some idiot was foolish enough to post free on the 
Alt.Games.Everquest newsgroup, instead of trying to get cash for the 
information.
