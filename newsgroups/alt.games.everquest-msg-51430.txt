Yes, but in a nutshell, your epic (which you won't have a prayer of seeing
until your early 50's at least), is a two-handed sword that can be broken
into 2 one-handed swords. Or if you want to look at from the other side, it
is 2 one-handed swords that can be joined into a two-handed sword ;-).

Don't let that wording confuse you. Once completed, your epic, The Jagged
Blade of War, can be switched back and forth between a 2hs and 2 1hs blades.
They look like blue and red light sabres from Star Wars when in 1hs mode,
and I'm not sure if I have seen them in 2hs mode.

Either way, it is certainly something to look forward to. However, you will
have to kill at least 2 dragons, and go to Plane of Fear and Plane of Hate,
as well as kill the Queen in Chardok, and a mountain giant who hits hard and
has tons of hitpoint (although this is the easiest of the above mentioned
mobs to kill.) You will also need to find a tinkerer who will make you
rebreathers. Start making friends :-)

Good luck

Lefty

p.s. Kind of a big nutshell, I know.
