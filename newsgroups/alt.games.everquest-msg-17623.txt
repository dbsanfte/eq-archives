Going on past experience the servers will be patched quite a few times after
Luclin goes live. I i
all items from old world that are all/all will be useable by the new race as
for items that have classes listed we will have to wait and see if Verant
adds the new class to them, As they are similar to Shaman class I imagine
that shaman specific items may be included to their class. And yes the
farmers will be there
