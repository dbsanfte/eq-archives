I know, I know, don't feed the troll and all that. I was scratching my head 
wondering how he escaped from my killfile, when it occurred to me that he 
used to be "Uber Nukah", if I'm not mistaken, and now is "Uber Nuker". 
Would that cause it? Maybe I neglected to make it a permanent plonk. Also, 
the new fake email address just continues to scream class, doesn't it?

He's a large part of what's wrong with EQ today. Too many immature idiots 
running around spewing ill-informed class envy crap.

What a putz. Re-plonk.
