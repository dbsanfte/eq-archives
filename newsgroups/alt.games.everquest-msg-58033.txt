  Well, I've sped up the schedule for my glorious return to EQ... I've
deleted several hundred megabytes worth of junk off my hard drive and as
soon as I get my copy of Kunark (I lost the original cd), I'll be back at it
again.  The prospect of playing my druid, magician and necromancer
characters again is not exciting me very much, so I'm thinking I'll start up
a shadow knight on the Firiona Vie server.

  However, the closest thing I've played to a tank/melee class are a few
rangers I abandoned before reaching level 15.  My highest level character
is/was level 42, so I'm not a newbie, but most of my experience is with
soloing/caster classes (but I have done a fair amount of grouping).  So I've
got a couple questions.

  First, I'm not quite sure how the "Taunt" skill works.  I know what it's
for, but I'm not sure exactly how it works.  Does it simply increase a
creature's "hate value" towards me, or does it work so that a "successful"
taunt will temporarily put me on the top of the creature's hate list (like a
"reverse Evade?")  Basically, what I want to know is, should I be constantly
tapping the Taunt button throughout the entire course of a fight if I want
the mobs hitting me, or is it only necessary for me to taunt when a mob
actually goes aggro on another character?

  Next, Harm Touch.  How often is it resisted by even cons and high blues,
assuming they have relatively average MR?  Will it work nearly all the time,
most of the time, or only about half the time?  Also, eq.castersrealm.com
has Harm Touch listed as a skill with a skill number/skill caps.  Is there
an actual Harm Touch skill number which increases as you use it, and does it
factor in to your ability to HT in any way (maybe in reducing resists)?  I
know the damage is dependent entirely on level (and the Unholy Aura
discipline).

  Also, with this character, I want to do a lot of dungeons and hunt in a
lot of zones that I never really paid much attention to with my druid and
other characters.  I kind of want to avoid the Karanas, the Commons, LOIO,
and the Frontier Mountains.  Does anybody have any good suggestions for
low-mid level dungeons for a shadow knight, and, more importantly, how to
actually find and organize a group to do those dungeons?  I've spent a fair
amount of time camping various items in dungeons with my druid (Guk for paw
rings and gatorscale leggings, Befallen for the paw ring, Permafrost for the
mammoth cloak and wolf fur slippers) and these zones were generally
completely empty while I was there, except for fellow campers/farmers and
maybe the occasional guild raid group.  How feasible is it to find or
assemble an appropriate level group to do these or similar dungeons without
planning it a week in advance in a guild, and does anybody have any tips for
assembling such a group?

  And, for the record, I plan on my character being an erudite... not the
most optimal choice, I realize, but I want to start a character with the
"human in armor" look, but I don't like the way some helmets look on humans.
:P  And at least I figure with an erudite, there's no experience penalty and
I won't have to worry about mana shortages too much. :)  Plus I just like
the whole erudite/heretics backstory.

  Thanks. :)
