The sonic defenders are a special case, they're permanently rooted as
a trigger for part of the war there so since they never move they
summon instead. They always spawn in fixed points, like 2 outside of
the owlbear cave when the wolves have taken if over. Easy to avoid if
you avoid the two cave systems (and I assume something similar for the
big grimling camp). Or, if you're pulling that area, pull with snare
or flamelick. Something low-damage that won't put a mob into summoning
mode. If it doesn't come after you, you might want to avoid it in HM. 

There's a minimum time between how often a mob can summon, not sure if
it's fixed or variable though but assume 10-15 seconds. Should be long
enough to root the mob (if it isn't permarooted), move out of melee
range and get a gate off. Those are low enough lvl that a 55 druid
should just be able to porcupine them though, just channel the
occasional chloroblast to stay alive.
