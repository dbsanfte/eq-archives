Not sure what your gripe is about?

If you have a warrior in your group, you should not be tanking.  If your not
tanking, your not casting high agro low damage spells like disease cloud
over and over (just a really low level example)

So where is all your mana going?!   Grouping typically involves a
chanter/bard who can help with mana regen, the mana used on pulls should be
minimul to zero (SK's can use bows too)

I can't think of a single reason in a exp group why a warrior would make a
better puller then a SK.  If you have a monk thats a different thing, but
you explicitly said warrior, not monk.

> Without manna, my effective contribution to the group is often severely
diminished.

If your group has a warrior to tank, I fail to see how lack of spells
severely diminishes your contribution.  SK dots are at best poor, only when
you get something like dooming darkness do you get a dot with decent damage
(but 1.5k or so at 49 is still very low in comparison to other dots) - their
main purpose is to get/hold agro

Unless your group already has a warrior - in which case thats his primary
job.

> Maybe I can't even outdamage a ranger.

In face to face combat, the order is something like -
monk, rogue, ranger, warrior, SK/pali, bard   (when I say face to face I
don't mean no spell casting, I just mean stood in front of the mob fighting)

So its fair to say you don't even come close to the damage of a ranger (and
rightly so)
