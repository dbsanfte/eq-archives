Yup, languages do mean something on FV, but they hold language fairs every
other saturday so it's not really a huge problem. The only example I can
think of are the tomes you get handed in Kaesora during the Shackle of
Tynnonium quest; you need to be able to read Iksar.

Then again, as long as you can read English you can visit Allakhazam and
find out what to do with the tome anyway :-)
