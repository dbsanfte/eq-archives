This is generally true only at lower levels (or if you've let a
particular skill lag for a LONG time).

At higher levels, you spend so much time meleeing (assuming you're a
melee class here), you will have more than enough time to cap all your
skills.

My warrior twinkie let his 2HS, 2HB, 1HB lag a lot.  By level 55, my
1HB was at 3 (yep, put one point in it when I created him and I think
I must have swing some 1HB weapon during the 55 levels I played him
because the first time I equipped a 1HB and started to try and raise
it, I saw "You have gotten better at 1HB (4)!").

I borrowed a friend's SoD and in the time I got 3 yellow bubbles, I
maxxed out my 1HB.

I've pretty much capped my 2HS as well.  My 2HB, I don't really care
too much about but if I need to, I can cap it easily enough.
