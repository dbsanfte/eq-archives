Just on the off chance that the store gives you a hassle about the return,
you will have another option available.  Since a phone call would be so
expensive for you, I think you can e-mail tech support, yes? Anyway.......
I had the exact same problem with the copy I bought for our second
account. After contacting tech support, I was asked to scan a .jpg of the
cd box w/ the CD inside and the key clearly visible, along with my
receipt, and e-mail the file to tech support.  I did that, and they
supplied me with a new account key which worked just fine.  Would probably
work for you as well.
