Essentially what you want is a dedicated tank (pref. Dwf warrior.. good str
and hp) and a dedicated healer. I see you have a cleric which is good. The
cleric should only only ONLY be healing and buffing when time and mana
allow. A ranger would give you the ability to track certain MoBs for
questing. Casters should load up on DoT and movement restricting spells
(lull, calm, root, etc.) to slow the MoB down. Possibly one to two casters
for direct damage but definitely need them to work on the MoB's agro
abilities and to slow down the attack.

But that's just my 2 cp.

Hanaar of Kaladim, 17th season warrior, E'ci, slave to none.
Lanala of Felwaithe, 7th season cleric, Cazic Thule, Healer of many.
