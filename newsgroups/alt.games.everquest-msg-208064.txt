Druids are Great Soloest(sp) I know you may have heard it a thousand time
but quading is king. at 48th lvl I am getting a whole blue bub per quad, and
3 quads per mana bar. Going after single targets many classes do more damage
than you BUT you root ensnare DOT DOT nuke med wait for the mob to start
moving again and repete. pretty simple. I can solo some reds but yellows die
faster meaning I get to look at something else on the screen. Quading blues
is your best bet, yellow bub a hour and on weekends lvl a day at higher
lvls/ 2 lvls at lower.

Have fun fellow druid
