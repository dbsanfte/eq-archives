For now, that is exactly my opinion.  If you are a "hardcore" player, EQ is
still the game that most fits that playstyle.  If you insist on "new", WoW
seems to be aiming to take that crown as soon as possible.  EQ2 doesn't
really seem to be heading that direction at all, and in fact some of the
game mechanic designed limitations suggest it never will.
