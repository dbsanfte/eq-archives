Actually, I think you're missing the boat on the NRA's argument here.  
The spirit of the Second Amendment, they would argue, has nothing to do 
with shepherds and wolves, and everything to do with empowering the people 
to take arms against a government that has become oppressive, in which 
case, those teflon "cop-killer" bullets are pretty much the whole point...
