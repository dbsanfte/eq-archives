There are at least two episodes that will probably never air on Cartoon
Network. -- Sympathy for the Devil (a child is 'villain') and Cowboy Funk
(which involves a plane hijacking and a terrorist who blows up buildings).

The CD soundtrack is amazing!

I noticed there is a new DVD over at Amazon called Cowboy Bebop:Best
Sessions .

>>The hit anime series on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim now available in a
special collector's edition - ONLY on DVD home video! 'Best Sessions'
features six completely remixed episodes chosen by acclaimed director
Shinichi Watanabe and fans of Cowboy Bebop! Experience the adventures of the
Bebop and her crew like never before!
Meet Spike and Jet, a drifter and a retired cyborg cop who have formed a
partnership in a bounty hunting enterprise. In a converted fishing ship the
Bebop, with the help of the intelligent data dog, Ein, and the voluptuous
and vexing femme fatale, Faye Valentine - Spike and Jet scour the galaxy in
search of wanted criminals. They're going to clean up space, one bounty at a
time!
A true DVD Collector's dream! Cowboy Bebop - Best Sessions will include six
episodes completely remixed in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound and DTS
Surround sound. Featuring both the original Japanese and English language
tracks, Dolby Digital 5.1 (Japanese and English), and an exclusive DTS
(Japanese), English subtitles option, Filmography (Shinichi Watanabe,
Toshihiro Kawamoto), Bandai Previews, and LIMITED Best Sessions collector's
DVD slipcase! <<


There is a movie called Cowboy Bebop Movie: Knocking on Heaven's Door as
well.  You could probably find it with one of those Napster-esque programs
for movies and tv shows -- I don't know if it ever was 'officially' released
in the US. I've seen some sites claiming they can sell you a non-region DVD
of it.
