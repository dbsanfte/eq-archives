Go to the island between Qeynos and Odus and hunt wisps. Destroy the
Burnt out Lightstones. Sell the regular Lightstones for about 7 gold
each. Turn in the Greater Lightstones to Smith Tv'ysa in the Dark Elf
camp in South Ro to get a book for caster research. Sell the book back
to her for around 8-9 plat. Make sure you have empty inventory slots,
b/c the books are considered containers and will drop to the ground if
you do not have adequate space. At 15 and 22, my Ranger did this for
an hour or so until he could afford all of that level's spells, and
still had enough left over to go browsing in the Bazaar for a slightly
used Foreman's cap and Ivy Etched Bracer.
