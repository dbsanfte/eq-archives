Video card, and more memory would both help.

For video card, get a GF4 ti-4200 or better, or one of the high end ATI 
Radeon cards/

For memory, 768MB or more would be helpful.

Currently I run a PIII 1.2GHz with 1GB of 133MHz SRAM, and a GF4 ti-4200 
with 128MB of DDRAM, and it runs great everywhere but the bazaar, and 
other extremely crowded areas, such as on raids.  Turnin off graphic 
options like PC names, and spell effects eliminates the problem on raids.
