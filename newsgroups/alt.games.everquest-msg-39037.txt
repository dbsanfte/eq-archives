What it comes down to, I guess, is that Bizbee is lamenting
poorly subbed moves, while Jeff has a problem with poorly
dubbed movies...

99% of all the movies I see are subbed, simply because the
Norwegian distributors sub all movies but children's fare.
And most of those are subtitled very well, and I am of course
very used to reading subtitles. However, if the dub is done
by skilled actors, reading a script from a good translator,
I'd bet I'd have no problem with that, either...
