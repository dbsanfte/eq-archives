Better yet, let's listen to the opinion of a woman who
was in the Luby's massacre and had both of her parents
murdered there:

    From an article published in the Dallas Morning News, Sunday
    April 29, 1992:

    ___Concealed weapons can prevent tragedies like Killeen's___

    By: Dr. Suzanna Gratia

         On Dec. 17, 1991, in Anniston, Ala., a restaurant patron
    defended himself and saved the lives of nearly two dozen others
    held hostage by two armed would-be robbers.  The reluctant hero,
    who was legally carrying his .45 caliber firearm, stopped both
    assailants before they could complete their crime or injure any
    other innocent customers.

         On Oct. 16,1991, in Killeen, Texas, an armed homicidal
    maniac methodically killed 22 people and then himself, facing no
    resistance from the scores of potential victims, including me.

         That tragedy will be forever etched in my memory.  My parents
    were brutally murdered, and I was helpless to protect them.  None
    of us in that restaurant could control our own destinies, for
    Texas politicians had seen fit to keep us disarmed.

        State law prohibits the concealed carrying of firearms,
   denying me or someone else the right to have a gun that day to
   protect ourselves and our loved ones from the rampages of a mad
   man.  That's flat-out wrong.  And I intend to do everything in my
   power to change that ill-gotten law to avert needless suffering by
   others.

        The violent incidents in Anniston , and Killeen ended far
   differently because of the laws governing the concealed carrying
   of firearms.  Alabama has a fair concealed-carry law, but in Texas
   the government has said, in effect, that decent citizens can't be
   trusted to carry firearms for self-protection.  The facts simply
   do not justify that conclusion.

        Despite claims of gun prohibitionists, allowing law-abiding
   citizens like me to choose to obtain a permit to legally carry a
   handgun in no way increases criminal behavior.  In Florida, a
   concealed-carry reform law was passed in 1988.  Anti-gun groups
   and the Florida media predicted an outbreak of shootings in the
   Sunshine State.

         But this fair and more uniform concealed-carry law simply
    hasn't shaken the foundations of the Florida legal systm, as doom-
    sayers predicted.  According to John Fuller, general counsel for
    the Florida Sheriff's Association, "I haven't seen where we have
    had any instance of persons with permits causing violent crimes,
    and I'm constantly on the lookout."

         In fact, it has the opposite effect on homicide rates.  After
    statewide concealed-carry law reforms were enacted in Florida, the
    homicide rate decreased 6 percent between l987 and 1990 as the
    national rate climbed 13 percent.  In Oregon, reformed carry laws
    adopted in 1990 returned a 20.8 prcent drop in the homicide rate.
    Again, the gun prohibitionists had predicted mayhem, and again,
    their predictions proved false.

         Research proves why: A government-funded survey of 1,874
    felons by noted criminologist James D. Wright and Peter H. Rossi,
    designed to determine the experiences of convicted felons with
    flrearms and their perceptions of gun laws, found about 40 prcent
    of the felons sampled said they had decided not to commit a crime
    because they feared the victim was carrying a firearm.  And 34
    percent had been "scared off, shot at, wounded or captured by an
    armed victim."

         Clearly, concealed carry laws translate to saving the lives
    of loved ones in a manner simllar to health or life insurance.  If
    ever there arises that time when it is needed, no substitute will
    do, and I don't intend to be victimized again.

         In drafting the Bill of Rights, the Founding Fathers
    acknowledged self-protection as a prime goal incorporated in the
    Second Amendment.  In quoting criminologist Cesare Beccaria, still
    renowned for his work On Crimes and Punishments penned in 1764,
    Thomas Jefferon said: "Laws that forbid the carrying of arms . ..
    disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to
    commit crimes.... Such laws make things worse for the assaulted
    and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than
    to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with
    greater confidence than an armed man."

         The question of carrying a concealed handgun is one that is
    highly personal.  It is a choice that should be made by the
    individual.  And it is a choice that should not be forbidden to an
    honest citizen like myself by an overprotective government,
    particularly one which has no responsibility to provide real
    protection when my life is threatened.

         American are expressing concerns regarding police protection
    when the explosion in crime literally overwhelms police
    departments across the nation.  In a public opinion survey done by
    the Gallup Report for the U.S. Justice Department's Sourcebook of
    Criminal Statistics, citizens were asked, "How much confidence do
    you have in the ability of the police to protect you from violent
    crime?"  Nationwide, 50 percent of the American public polled
    responded "not very much" to "none".

         In the District of Columbia, where there has been a virtual
    gun ban since 1976, the local court of appeals followed the long
    accepted rule that the police have no duty to protect individuals,
    only the community at large.

         In states with no provision for concealed carry, legislation
    should be proposed, passed and enacted to allow law-abiding
    citizens the chance to protect themselves from criminal attack.
    In those states that employ discriminatory and unfair concealed-
    carry laws which virtually forfeit citizen opportunities for these
    permits, legilation must shift the burden of proof to the issuing
    authority to show reasons for denial and away from the honest
    citizen seeking a permit.

         While organized police forces do attempt to protect the
    public, more and more they are unable to do.  In fact, armed
    private citizens encounter and thwart three times as many
    criminals as law enforcement.  This is not to suggest a diminished
    role for our nation's law enforcement, but rather to emphasize the
    importance of armed self-defense before police can respond to a
    crime in progress.  Evidence indicates that the armed citizen is
    probably the single most effective deterrent to crime in the
    nation.

         When it comes to arbitrary enforcement or prohibition on the
    lawful concealed carrying of firearms, what has the law-abiding
    American public done to warrant such a mistrust of their
    competency and character?  Ask your elected officials.  I'm asking
    mine.

Dr. Gratia subsequently ran for the Texas State legislature
and was elected.  She helped pass Texas's concealed handgun
license program.

Over the next few years, violent crimes (including homicides)
went down in Texas.
