Maybe they are happy with knowing they are the first L60 noe on their
server? Maybe *them* knowing it is more important to them, and they
don't really give a shit if you worship them, or have never heard of
them. In fact, why play this game at all, because you sure ain't gonna
end up on the cover of Time magazine because of it.

ANSWER: Because they want to. They may well have set themselves a
target, or be competing in a race to 60, or whatever, but who cares?
Until they come here boasting about it and demanding we bow down before
them, who are we to tell them they can't? Someone *HAS* to be the first
cat to L60. Someone else *will* comment on it

Lemme give you an example.

The other day, walking around the green as green Luclin zone, I came
across a weapon with an AWESOME graphic. Spiked Hammer or something, but
it has the best look I've ever seen, but stats are crappy: 10/40 2hb. In
my bags, I have some of the best weapons available (Jaelen's, Primal,
SoD, Nevhorn, etc.) but when I'm pottering around town, I wear the
hammer. 
Why? 
Because I want to.
Because it looks great.
Because people cross the street to comment on it.

Is it going to get me on the cover of magazines and papers across the
world? Of course not. That's not why I wear it. And people don't PL to
60 for that reason either
