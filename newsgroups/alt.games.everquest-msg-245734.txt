>On Morell-Thule Spider silks go for 8  - 35 plat each. Obviously the 35 plat
>fellow does not sell much. LOL  Most go for ten plat each. Silk swatches at 20
>each. At least that's what I sell mine for and they go fast.

Cheepest tonight is 2p, 9g, 1s, 1c. only 10 of those.
about 60 going for 3pp, various vendors combined.
about 500 going for 4pp.
and about 300 going for 5pp (including my 75 right now.)

This is an unusual night (being saturday night and all) there are
usually less than 100 going for less than 5pp during the week.

There is a veritable glut of spider silks. I fully expect it to go
back to normal tomorrow night.
