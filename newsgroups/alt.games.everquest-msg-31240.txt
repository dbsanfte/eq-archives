Thanks to all of you for the advice. I guess all classes have their
fans, so I'll just create a few characters and try them out for a
couple of days. Played a Wood Elf Druid up to lvl 4 yesterday and it
was a lot of fun, so I think I will stick with him for a couple of
days. Plus, I have the added bonus of knowing the zone (GFay) from
playing my Cleric there.

Thanks again...
