Roleplaying isn't just your "thee and thou" rp nazi. Any time you're
taking the role of your character you're roleplaying. 

Basically everyone is roleplaying in some fashion except the worst of
the dewds, and an argument could even be made for them.

So yes, roleplaying in the broad sense is definately the point of the
game. Others may use it as a glorified chatroom, but if they ever
hunt, tradeskill, sell things, or interact with strangers in an in
game sense, they are roleplaying.

You keep making this claim, which was relevant earlier in the thread,
but not in my reply.

This has *nothing* to do with how many people are able to deliberately
act differently in an rpg. It only says that those who choose not to
do so in such and such a way (which they do). Some segment of the
population is like that. But among the population that isn't, most are
quite capable of "acting". And with both populations combined, the
amount of people capable of acting in an rpg with the benefit of
anonymity is higher than the number of people who are good actors,
your claim, in real life.

You lost the context and now you're talking about something I was
never referring to. Go back and see what I responded to, it should
make things clearer. And hopefully, someday, you'll gain the ability
to keep your attention on something for more than one post.

I don't need equipment, I just need your retarded one word replies. If
you are incapable of asking intelligent questions, I won't bother
answering.

Here's a hint, sunshine. "Why?" with no context is not an intelligent
question.

I do. Every question you've asked has been answered, logically and
with examples.

If you aren't capable of understanding them, kiddo, as simple as they
are, say now.

The problem is, I simply gave an opinion at first. Do you know what an
opinion is? Only after called into question do I need to defend it. I
don't give two shits if you agree with it or not, I'm not here to
convince you of anything.

Incorrect. Again. Whether or not I decide to bog something down with
evidence depends on whether or not I think someone will try to argue
it. In this case I didn't. But given some two year old's insistence on
saying "why? why? why?" like some brat being told they can't have an
ice cream cone, I clarified. In hindsight, I wish I hadn't, you don't
appear capable of making the distinction.

I gave my opinion. 

Get it yet?

>Or try finding some support for your position.

Already done. If you aren't capable of figuring it out, that's not my
problem.

Meaningless pointless psychobabble. Whether or not they do has nothing
to do with what I claimed. That's called a red herring, chum. Try
again.

Strawman. I don't think that at all, nor have I ever claimed to. Your
examples clearly state that people anonymous act without regards, or
with little regard, to social inhibitions (in other words, they act
like jerks). To quote:

>I believed, at the time, that people who were
>jerks in the game were probably jerks in RL,
>although in the face of a few anecdotes about some
>players who were nasty gits in the game, but nice
>as pie in real life,

Both examples assumed they were either acting like a jerk, or were a
jerk in real life. Those inhibitions exist for a reason. If you are
seriously claiming that someone ignoring them isn't acting in a
socially reprehensible manner, say so now so I can dump you in the
troll bucket.

The fact is, I don't argue with this. Some people do act like jerks.
Some people really are jerks. Both cases are IRRELEVANT to my reply.
My claim, then as now, is that people are more capable of acting out
of character in a game than in real life, both deliberately and
accidently. Why you try to tie that to other parts of your argument is
beyond me; I have to assume out of some desperate need to argue with
me, for whatever reason.

There is none. They are "being" female, in terms of the game. That is
all that's required to meet my definition of roleplaying, and for that
matter the standard one. See below.

I was correct. You have no idea what it is. Or your definition is so
narrow only "thee'rs and thou'rs" are roleplayers.

role-play (rlpl)
v. role-�played, role-�play�ing, role-�plays
v. intr.

To assume or act out a particular role: 'When I hire people I
role-play with them... to see how they take pressure'

>
>Most of those that do roleplay, do not do it well.
>I don't believe the games lend themselves very
>well to roleplaying.

To your narrow definition of it, maybe. Do you claim that only you
know what roleplaying is?

By my definition of roleplaying, which is also the dictionary and
industry definition, not only does virtually everyone roleplay there's
virtually no way to do it badly.

Let's reiterate so you don't forget, shall we? Roleplaying doesn't
mean saying thee and thou and acting like a bad medieval B movie
outtake. The only ones who believe that are some of the people who do
it, the RP nazis.

>And, I'm not the only one that thinks this way.

Koster is welcome to his opinion, as irrelevant to this as it is,
since it is referring to hardcore roleplayingish, not what we're
talking about (there's that context thing again, you have trouble with
that don't you?). MMORPG's are RPGs by any definition of the term. If
you don't believe that, then you are going from a narrow definition
that doesn't particularly fit the facts.

Ask Koster if he believes Dungeon Siege or Diablo 2 is a RPG. We're
talking about one of the people who designed UO here. He's going to be
about as RP nazi as they get. He is not a good example.

Notice I don't make any claims as to whether or not his ideals are
better. A system where his idea of roleplaying would be great. But his
idea of roleplaying is *not* the only, nor the best definition.


>Simply clicking the gender button on the character
>creation screen does not mean you are roleplaying.

But playing in game as a female does. Or as a halfling. Or as a
paladin. Or as a follower of Bristlebane.

Any further idiotic "why?" questions without further context will be
treated in the way they deserve. Start listening and stop pretending
to be some omniscient intellectual giant. You aren't.
