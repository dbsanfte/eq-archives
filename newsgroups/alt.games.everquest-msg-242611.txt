This I would have to disagree with.  Situational awareness is completely an
attribute of the player, not of the class.  It might be more obvious when an
enchanter is situationally aware than a warrior, shaman, or any other class
but it is not more likely to happen.  It's also more obvious when an
enchanter is not situationally aware.   (Cue bad enchanter stories.(1))

Perhaps back in the day a non-situationally aware enchanter would give up
the class when they realized how badly they sucked.  But as you've been
saying... this is not back in the day.   First with the outdoor single
pulling groups, then with overpowered pacify, it's quite possible to get
into the 50's or 60's and still have an enchanter who hasn't faced much more
than a double pull.   Leveling up in LDoN does not teach the best skills for
being aware of wandering adds.

(1) I'm sure you know at least a few.   They're those enchanters who are
really good for very little except being buff bitches for raids.  One
enchanter in particular, I lost track of the number of times I saw her call
out that she had just cast "aggro up" on one of the clerics.  And anytime I
was tanking, I had to watch my buffs and be ready to click off the enchanter
aggro reducer spell.    I didn't even bother asking which enchanter had
screwed up when it happened...

And the one time she ended up invited to our exp group still gives me
nightmares.  (2)


(2) "Dammit paladin boy!   When you do group invites, start thinking with
your other head!  Nothing was worth putting up with this."

Really have to agree with this part.  Putting "wmp" in every buff request is
as stupid and unncessary as appending "pst" to everything.  Of course it's
when mana f'ing permits.  When I tell you a buff has faded, it's to let you
know that it's gone.   Not a demand that you instantly drop everything to
fix this horrid situation of me having less than 14 buffs.

Hehe... I begin to wonder if this enchanter knew me.

My characters each had an "enchanter" hotkey.

"Haste! Bitch! NOW!!"
"Haste! Bitch! NOW!!"

No, I'd have to agree with him.  It's poitnless spam.  You have to trust
your enchanter to be able to lock down all of the mobs except the main one.
Mostly because theres not a whole hell of a lot you can do about it.   Crowd
control is the enchanters job.  You have to let him do it.  Heal messages
are similarly useless, unless you think the healer is sleeping instead of
playing.   The only exception is Complete Heal, due to the long cast time.

I don't.  (as I said before, I agree with the part about "I don't need to
announce mezes.  Stop trying to be a hero and the job will get done that
much faster")... just the one particular statement about pulling.

Pulling is much much easier at 65.    In your thirties you can shoot an
arrow at an ancille in Mistmoore and end up aggroing things in LDoN's
Mistmoore, three zones away.  It wasn't until the 50's that aggro radius
reductions from leveling became good enough that controlled pulling was
really possible for me.   Before that it was more "shoot an arrow at one of
them and pray".   At 65 it was more ... "Our enchanter is looking bored.
Maybe if I shoot at all three of them, more than one will come to camp."
