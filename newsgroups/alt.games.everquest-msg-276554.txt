First, let us discuss the Concordance of Research.  It is in this book that 
you combine looted objects that combine to make runes to help you learn the 
research skill.  Unfortuately, this trade skill container does not have the 
capacity to learn recipes.  So, you must load each object separately for 
each rune you wish to make.  The Froglok Eye is one component to make 
Apprentice Rune Azia.  I have gathered many rune components all the way 
through the highest level runes.  But for the most part I skipped  this set 
because the eye drops in Guk and the froglocks have faction I did not want 
to lower.  (Except for the rare eye that someonoe gave me) I went directly 
to the Training Rune set.

Secondly, I will discuss the Book of Dark Bindings (or the named books for 
the other pure casters - each having his own book).  It is in this book that 
you place one rune Azia and one rune Beza of whichever level will give you 
experience.  If you are successful in the combine, you get a .... rune 
Complete.  This Complete rune has no function at all except as you sell it 
to help recover some of the cost of making the rune.  I have not tried to 
make favorite recipes in this Book of Dark Bindings, but it appears you may, 
as you are reporting information consistent with that.  Also in this book, 
and in accord with recipes,  you may combine Words to make real spells. 
This is what research is all about.
