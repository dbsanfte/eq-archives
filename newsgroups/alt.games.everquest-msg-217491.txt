 Hmmm, unless they changed things for Blessing of Temperance it wont stomp
over the Druid line of Hp/AC buffs the give mana. The only ones that do that
are Protection of the Cabbage (59), Protection of the Glades (60),
Protection of the Nine (63), and Blessing of the Nine (65).

Now Virtue on the other hand.... When ever I hear that the groups cleric is
doing a Blessing of Virtue I run screaming in the opposite direction so that
I dont have to recast my PoT9 :)
