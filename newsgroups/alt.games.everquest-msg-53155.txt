Well, the mana difference between clarity and breeze isn't so bad; neither
costs that much and both last a long time. Clarity at 75 mana still costs less
than either Augmentation or Alacrity.

Alacrity gives 40% haste (at best) for 115 mana.  At level 30, I'm not sure I'm
not getting that much speed from it yet. OTOH it lasts only a few minutes. Ten
maybe? I haven't timed it, but it's short; you have to keep reapplying about
every third or fourth kill it seems. Augmentation, on the other hand, lasts 27
minutes. It costs 90 mana and gives 28% haste, 30 agi, 9 ac, and stamina regen
for those peeps swinging wurmys and other heavy weapons. I strongly suspect the
other benefits might well outweigh a 12% or less haste reduction and make it a
better spell; but I wanted to see what other people thought.
