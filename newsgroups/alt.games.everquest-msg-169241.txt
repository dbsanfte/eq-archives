   Hate to have to be the one to break it to you, but you don't decide
who gets to respond to any thread, even one you start, and you don't get
decide what anyone can or cannot post.  I know you didn't phrase it as a
demand, and that's good.  But even so, you are not a teacher handing out
assignments to the group.  Anyone who wants to will respond, like my non
post 50 self, and we say whatever we please.

   Oh, and this thread was doomed to become a flame war the moment you
selected the title.  Just so you know.
