You actually end up under the FoB.  I went LD in FoB once and came back with
sky around and below and all the mobs walking around over my head.  There
were a few mobs with me that I decided to fight whlie waiting for a GM.  Of
course, if I had died, I would not haver been able to recover my corpse
until the GM showed.

I was told that the bug was well known and that they were having trouble
getting it fixed.  Seems that at least one person a day needs rescue from
under the FoB.
