Take a look at my sig below........

I agree with you 100%.

It really comes down to the player. You and I find the time
commitments and the slow progress at higher levels more trouble than
it is worth. Others feel that the game doesn't start to get
interesting until you reach 50+. 

The real "truth" about EQ is that levels and loot are worthless if you
are not having fun when you play. If a player never gets a character
past level 30, he can have as much fun (or more) than a player who has
8 level 60s. 

Levels/Loot != Happiness in EQ
Having fun = Happiness in EQ

The best thing about EQ is that all of us can play it the way that we
enjoy. There is nothing wrong with retiring a high level character and
starting over, if that is how you want to play.

Play the way you want to, and above all have fun!
