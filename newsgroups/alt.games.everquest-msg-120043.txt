No completion, it is made to cause you to pay them $12.95 forevermore.

You only have updated graphics in the form of higher resolution
textures in Everquest, Kunark and velious if you choose to upgrade
the old world ones with luclin.  You only have updated character
models if you install luclin and choose to enable them. You only have
velious textures if you choose to use the old world models and enable
velious textures (they don't work on luclin models)
