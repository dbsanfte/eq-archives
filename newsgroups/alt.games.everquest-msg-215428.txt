    u r l33t. I bow to you.

    Because you lowball in the normal difficulty dungeons to pick up fast
points, perhaps? On Test, Hard dungeons are 150 points. Then you'll want
that cleric, as having a druid doesn't really cut it.

    Agreed. I will res in monk/rogue/warrior/bard, though, or anyone who
isn't bound nearby (most aren't). You'll do more net DPS by ressing them in
than waiting for them to arrive.

    If you're doing normal, agreed, they have enough healing and they offer
damage shields and nukes (resist buffs? rofl). Casters will also prefer Bot9
over Virtue on normal. If you're in hard, though, then unless you bring a
paladin you're giving up a lot of HPs that you can't afford to give up.
You're also losing out on all those extra goodies, as the druid won't have
mana for them. And if you get into a jam, you'll find the druid's "fast
heal" isn't so fast.

> This leaves me totally baffled about what clerics do in LDoN?

    I heal, I buff, I melee with my Withering Staff of Agony, I nuke, I pull
with Pacification and/or MoR, I stun things trying to Gate, I offtank while
cc does its thing. I seem to find ways to stay busy.

    Lucky for them, based on past posts. Snip retarded idea on resses that
would make zerg guilds happy beyond their wildest dreams.

    No, there should be no way to zerg the adventures. I know a LD sucks - I
have my only loss from going LD, and coming back to be tagged with the loss
after my group had already won without me (we were down to 2 items left to
collect when I went LD, normal difficulty).

    Assholes and people with weak connections leaving groups stranded are
not new things to EQ. They will always be liabilities.

    People would still do it. "Wizard, come in and nuke till OOM, then Gate
out and we'll get another. We'll let you roll on the mini boss loot
afterwards if you do it."
