Hey all,

First, forgive the lengthy post.  Second, hoping I can perhaps get
some good feedback.  I recently went through a shift change for my
employer that has put me out of touch with many of the
friends/guildies I usually grouped with.  Furthermore, the only time I
can get on to play is very early in the morning at a time when my
server population is at it's lowest (usually about 25% of normal hours
population).  Those folks usually on at that hour I've found are
usually raiding, camping, terrible to group with, or newbies.  Very
rarely can I find a group even in some of the normally overcrowded
zones.  I'm a 32 Barbarian Warrior still wearing crafted and stuck on
32.  I can take on a single blue at a time with the appropriate
bandaging afterwards, but anything white or higher owns me.  I can
usually find a group in the more common 30ish (after many OOC's and
usually an extended wait time) zones such as OT and FM, but have
become so bored with those zones that I don't even consider them when
looking for somewhere to hunt.  I realize that the warrior is possibly
the worst possible class to solo with as well and have several
alternate's to play when I absolutely can not find a group.  Problem
is I'm finding that the 'no group' thing is becoming the standard and
my alternates are getting a pretty decent workout.  I love my warrior
and don't want to give him up, but at this rate, it'll take me forever
to get to 33 and he'll eventually be surpassed by my alternates.  I
have a fairly steady income with one of my alternates ability to
tailor some of the higher end items so could, in theory, buy some
slightly better equipment albeit slowly (can raise about 1K pp in
three or four hours of auctioning/tailoring/hunting supplies).  So, I
ask for any suggestions anyone has, whether it be suggestions for
equipment or camps/spawns that are above average xp that I could
handle.  Keeping in mind that although the reduction in server
population is a hindrance, it has also been beneficial in that many
normal spawns/camps are free or available after a short wait.  I also
have five or six hours, four days a week, to devote to playing him
during this time frame.

Any help is appreciated, thanks in advance, and sorry again for the
lengthy post.
