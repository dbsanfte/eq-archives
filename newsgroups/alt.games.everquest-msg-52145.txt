Damage is the key factor to a pet weapon.

Delay on a pet is always 30, regardless of weapon (since a long ago patch)

Maximum damage for a pet, though, is equal to whichever is higher, the
pets normal maximum, or twice the listed damage for the weapon.
Your pet will never be disadvantaged by giving him a weapon, therefore,
but can be improved, particularly at lower levels.

Unless small amounts of money are a real difficulty, a rusty two hander
is the way to go for single digit mages and necros.  Rusty halberds are
better, but often hard to find.

As you've observed, the improvement on a pet with a weapon drops
off as you level up; that rusty halberd is only increasing the 16 pet by
a couple points at best, while its quadrupling the damage output of a
first level pet.

Something amusing, though, if your main picks up high damage
but ultra long delay "trash loot", is to give it to your pet instead
of vendorizing it.  Sure, in a way thats 15pp poorly spent... but
then again, if you exercise caution that uber pet will last a looooong
time, essentially you are powerleveling yourself by buffing up the
pet damage output.  How many other people with only one
account can use one character to powerlevel another?

Hmm, also look at procs; your pet will get a proc roll every
time it swings (on its 30 delay cycle, that is to say) as long as
it (not you) is high enough level to "command the weapon"

Velium weapons are popular, if your pet is at least 25 you'll
see it slaming a few bonus 12dd rounds off per combat.  More
useful, IMO, is a pair of Gnoll Hide Lariats, available for little
effort or for about 5pp each retail, they proc stuns.  Excellent
for use on caster mobs, and not at all bad on tank mobs either,
their disadvantage in the hands of PCs, the low damage output,
vanishes in the hands of a pet; it continues to default to its
normal damage!
