As you can tell, int and wis doesn't matter much at all for twinking
purposes. Its all about mana items. and now, since a fw patches ago,
you can't dump 150 mana on items onto a lvl 1 wiz and see his mana bar
go to 20%.  mana items don't even start working until about lvl 4. At
least thats when I noticed it on my wiz twink.
