I quit playing EQ a couple of years ago.  I became intrigued by the
changes recently and started a new account.  I am enjoying it
somewhat.  I would however like to see some higher level stuff without
getting divorced.  ;)  If you have cancelled your account and have a
40+ char on it (I don't care if naked or not) I would love to pick up
where you left off.  I don't want to buy/sell your account just see a
little more of the world.  I have couple of friends that play on Mith
Marr so I would prefer that server.  I know, beggers, choosers.  Drop
me an email if you feel like helping me out.  If it makes you feel
better flame away.  wendyeq@yahoo.com
