I will NEVER explore a new zone again without first reading up on it and
getting a map.

I took my mage who recently reached lvl40 to Sanctus Seru and thought it
would be fun to explore the zone.  The place is huge and empty with very few
NPCs that will say anything but "Greetings, XXXX".  I did find one NPC that
asked me to find someone in Grieg's End.

I took the teleport to the hallway that encircles the zone....what a
mistake!  It goes on forever and nothing of interest there (FYI, Levitation
does not work in this zone).  After that I explore the city level and again
found nothing of interest.  As I made my way down to the lower levels, I
came upon what I thought might be stables and start looking for horses.

What I had mistaken for stables were actually jail cells.  That's when I
ended up in front of a cell with "captured Netherbians".   Well, they
pounced on me and stunned me so I couldn't get a gate off and promptly
killed me (hitting for 159, 135, etc).  The guards just stood there.
Dropped me back down to lvl39 :(

Anyway....be careful down there.
