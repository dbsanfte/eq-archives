he drops blue diamonds but is not a good source .He drops a rare gem about
every 3rd kill . They moved his spawn cycle to 6 minutes from 2 . He has a
ph called a goblin sacrifice .

My chanter and a ranger friend stopped hunting him when they moved the spawn
cycle to 6 minutes . Before that he was an incredible exps source.
