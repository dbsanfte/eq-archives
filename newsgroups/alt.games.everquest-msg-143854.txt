Unfortunately, the web site is not clear on which particular exploit they
were suspended for.  "Z axis" is very vague.

However, judging by this line:

[Tue Aug 27 19:48:00 2002] Blixtev says, 'as you can guess I pulled youi
in here for pulling the 4th to final mob to the 1st mobs position
through use of Z axis exploitation'

My _guess_ is that they used the exploit that lets you exploit the
pathing so that a mob "magically" warps on top of you (without aggroing
anything on is way).  

But that's just a guess.  

I do not know whether this is the particular exploit that is used on the 
Dain, but I have observed it in use in pulling other mobs to skip
content.
