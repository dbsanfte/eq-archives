Baking ain't bad right now.  A stack of Fish Rolls will last you
forever, and mastering baking is dirt cheap, if you know the right
route to it.  Later on, when you have the cash to finance it, you
might want to look into Blacksmithing, and make your own fine plate,
imbued fine plate, and cultural armor.  Also look into fishing, it
helps relieve the tedium of medding.
