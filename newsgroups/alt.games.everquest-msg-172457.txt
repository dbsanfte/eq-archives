After 7 real-life days your corpse rots (disappears). So you have a week
to get back online and recover your corpse. A cleric (level 14+) or
high-level paladin can resurrect you, which will make you reappear back
at your corpse, where you can then loot it and get your stuff back.
However, your corpse can only be resurrected (rezzed) within 3 hours of
*play* time (not real time) of your death.

Also, after level 10, when you die to will lose experience. Higher-level
clerics (and paladins) can cast rezzes which will recover some of your
experience; if you simply loot your corpse, you won't get the exp back.
You *can* loot just some stuff - just make sure to leave something on
the corpse so it doesn't poof, as it will if you loot everything off it.

FYI, here are the percentages for rezzes from clerics with cleric level:

Level %rez
14     0
19    10
24    20
29    35
34    50
39    60
44    75
49    90
56    96

Note that the level is that of the cleric, not of you. The exp restoration
at the low levels isn't the main advantage - the advantage is in saving
you a run to your corpse. But a friendly higher-level cleric may be willing
to help. Just PLEASE don't bug them personally; speaking as a cleric,
I *like* rezzing people, but sometimes I'm busy doing other things. I
really don't want to start going /anon or /role to avoid getting bugged.
If you want a rez, ask using /ooc or /shout and you may get lucky.

If you have Planes of Power, travel between some cities may be done more
quickly using the "books" you'll see near many cities. Unfortunately
High Keep is not one of the cities.

Druids and Wizards are capable of porting other characters. However, the
warnings about asking for rezzes also apply to ports. Providing ports is
a favour, and frequently a charged service; don't just expect to get a
free port.

I don't know the stats of the weapons you mention, but there's 2 main
components to weapon damage: damage and delay. High damage is good,
low delay is good. damage divided by delay gives you an idea of the
relative strength of two weapons. (It's more complicated than that, but
it's a good starting point.)

My guess is that the steel longsword has the same damage but lower delay.

http://eq.crgaming.com/menu/ranger.asp is a good reference; there's a
guide to spells and their locations there.

It appears that to get that spell you'll need to go to Luclin. Going
via the Plane of Knowledge will be quickest, if you have Planes of
Power. Otherwise there's a portal in one of the Karanas (can't remember
exactly where).

If you don't have Luclin... you might be able to get somebody to get it
for you, though I'm not sure whether you could mem it without the
expansion.
