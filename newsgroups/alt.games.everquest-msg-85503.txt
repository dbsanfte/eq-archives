It's just very odd. The combine empire collapsed, but the northern gods
are still active. As shown by the fact that beastlords can follow Mithaniel
Marr (thanks to the guy who posted that, I don't have luclin). So it almost
seems that the northern people spurned their own gods for some reason. And
given that these are Gods, and unarguably still alive, that seems like a
really brave move on behalf of the mortals (I assume) who make up the
tribunal.

True enough I guess, although it's interesting...

Brell Serilis -> Dwarves
Tunare -> Elves
Innoruuk -> Dark Elves
Brell Serilis -> Gnomes
Rallos Zek -> Ogres
Fizzlethorpe -> Halflings
Cazic Thule -> Trolls, Iksar

Which could be taken to mean that the only race that turned away from
its creator is the barbarians. With the rest of humanity that came
after them remaining without a `patron' god. Even though they actually
have clerics.

An interesting side effect is that it is two `classes' of spells that are
not sold by the Halas shaman guild. Spells of vision are sold by the gypsies,
which sort of meets the `mystical' reputation of such people. The other is a
lone barbarian who sits out in Everfrost selling Disease and Poison. He is
actually seperated from his people. Be interesting to know what faction he's
on.

Then again, this is almost certainly simply to make it more difficult to find
these spells. Since Trolls and Ogres have a very similar set up despite being
unarguably evil races.

> Fun discussion line no matter how it turns out ;)

It mostly came from the fact that the tribunal don't even rate a mention in
the `history' in the start of the EQ manual. They certainly don't have a
`plane' or a great involvement in how Halas runs. Heck, the only barbarian
in the manual is a follower of Rallos Zek, an amoral (at best) god. 

The tribunal. Don't know who they are, don't know what they stand for, but
piss em off and they'll send the boys round.
