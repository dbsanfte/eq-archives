rofl you really need a life Backbeat Downbeat. I never took much notice of any
of the EQ boards till recently and your flame is over all of the ones i have
seen.

What difference does it make that the person who replied to you is a druid
ingame? That person is entitled to his opinion and his comment holds more water
because it is not flame. Everything you post on EQ boards is flame.

Maybe you should have a word with your parents and tell them you do not want to
play Everquest any more. That will then give you more free time to play games
that you will enjoy such as errr Sonic Hedgehog, Mario or some other game
suitable for your age.

I would advise you also consider ending your contract with your isp. After all,
these constant complaints and anti-Sony drivel must build up an awful lot of
stress in you. That is very unhealthy and removing the means to post that
drivel (i.e. cancel your internet account) would make your life so much fuller
and complete.

I hope you will follow my sound advice so you can enjoy a much happier
lifestyle and get rid of all of that pent up aggression and frustration.

Enjoy your new life with Sonic the Hedgehog. Good riddance
