Erm, yeah, I mean... 7 days time be it if you make it in game or not. 
You know how your ressurection timer is supposed to count down only
when you're online and not off...  You got the idea.

And when I refer to ungodly amounts of time, I'm thinking of the guys I
see posting on random message boards like "Hi, I just got back from a
business trip that I was on for three months.  I died right before I
went, and I couldn't get my corpse.  I can't seem to find it now, but
is there any possibility that I could get it back?"  =O
