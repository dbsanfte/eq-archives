Never seen him up, and surely you'll admit that this is a fight on par
with most of what you have to kill for the warrior epic. (Do you really
consider the Maestro harder than that? Or the minibosses in Fear? Ok.
Maybe the Spiroc Wing Lord.)

Never seen a swiftblade up for sale on my server. What do you normally
sell them for? And where in CT do they drop? Right now, the best we can
attempt (usually) is a full xp group or two in the maze in CT. Taking
James' advice, we've been trying to get an organized outing for the maze
to get the spider hats for our wizards. If some nice melee weapons were
dropping there, the incentive to get our lazy tanks in with us would go
way up. (Our loot trip yesterday, for example, was wizard - necro -
cleric - bard - druid - and a paladin for our tank. *sigh*. And that was
only in Seb. We were all low to mid fifties except the cleric who was
sixty, and did the pulling.)

> Totally given up on your warrior now, for the wizard?

Well, these are relative terms, of course, that change with the season.
Last year I totally gave up on the wizard (and the monk and the necro)
for the warrior. I haven't stripped him. The only item of his I'm
thinking of selling off is the scale. He's only brought out of
retirement now for raids where he's used for offtanking, ghettomezzing,
etc. when not enough 55+ tanks are going to show up. (And it still
pisses me off.)

But who knows? I keep him intact because the day may come when I want to
tank again. And he'll be ready. But he won't be in line for any epic
mobs. Several of my former "junior" tanks have now passed me and will be
ahead of me in line should be get the planes encounters for the warrior
epic, or god forbid, a green scale.
