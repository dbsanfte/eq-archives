I'm always willing to accept that all of us have different
definitions for the word 'boring'.

I find reading books to be interesting, as long as the storyline or
the material isn't boring. I have met folks over the years who find
reading anything to be boring.

Well, not all of the people who do some form of chat do it on EQ.
Otherwise there would be more servers just to handle the chat load.

Hmm. I'm not sure about that. I've met people who must have ketchup
on any food they eat. They get rather intense if no ketchup is
available.
