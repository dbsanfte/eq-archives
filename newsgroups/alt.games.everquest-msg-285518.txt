This arguement has been done to death, and it doesn't hold water any 
more now that it did the 12 previous times I've heard it.

Patch days are ideal days to play, particularly the first hour or so 
after the patch is complete.

Why?

Because the way EQ is set up, many "named" mobs pop on server reset. 
This means its possible to "cherry pick" those mobs when you may be 
staring down dozens of hours of camping in order to respawn those 
targets, or to wait for them to repop on a 3.5 day timer after some more 
enterprising people have hit them.

Sure, some mobs don't respawn until a day after, or until 3.5 days 
after, a patch... but there are a lot that do.

So, many sensible people want to log in and play on patch days, despite 
the fact that patches often screw up the game.

A bonus; sometimes the game is screwed up just a little, so its still 
very playable, you go in and get your target mob, be he Lord Bergurgle 
or what have you, then they repatch, and you can go get him Again a 
couple hours later.  Two named kills in two hours span, instead of in an 
average of 36 hours of endlessly killing greens in order to possibly 
spawn him a couple times?

Anyway, why I might want to log in on a patch day isn't relevant, the 
fact remains that the information pipeline they set up regarding patches 
isn't working right, and hasn't worked right since their descision many 
years ago to stop telling us how many people were logged on to each 
server.  When we could see that there were only two or three people on a 
server, it was easy to surmise that those people were test personelle 
checking the patch out, and when the numbers started climbing up into 
the tens, hundreds, thousands, that the server was in fact back in business.

Reducing that information to a simple yes/no, while hiding the actual 
head counts, should have been fairly simple to implement, but here we 
are what, 5 years later, and its still not done.

I call that sloppy and careless... and the "will be" tag still showing 
several hours after it should have been changed to "is" or "well no, we 
didn't actually start that yet" or something is merely more evidence of 
that thought process.
