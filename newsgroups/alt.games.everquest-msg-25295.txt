Ok, thanx for the info. Heard about the "teach 1 point higher" before, but only
once, and only as a rumor, so never tried it.

Didnt know about the language codes either, usually just teach 1 language at a

Plan to get all the languages, so just need to find a guy willing to spend some
hours spamming with me.
