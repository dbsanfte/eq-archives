Ok, my main computer crashed. I had EQ installed on my alternate box and it
had worked before. I didn't have PoP installed on that one so I installed
it.  To the incorrect directory. :-(   So I reinstalled to the correct one.
Now I've been crashing to the desktop every two minutes. I also can't see
some visuals (the guards in OT aren't what they should be) even though I
have everything turned on. Help!  Any ideas?
