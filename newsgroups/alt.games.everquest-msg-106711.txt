As someone with both a pretty twinky caster AND a fungi tunic let
me just say that the fungi tunic surpasses anything else ;) It works
for casters too, or at least druids, which a lot of people seem to
be ignoring (shamans too, I think), but my god, Perl soloed her
ranger to level 35 in 2 weeks while I was away for christmas and
loaned it to her.

2 weeks. Melee. 35 levels. Solo. While still playing her main at
raids and so forth.

Having spent too much time enjoying my druid inefficiently and not
enough powernutzoid powerlevelling her I'm not sure if that lets
her "catch up to the casters" , but I'd be pretty damn surprised
if it didn't.
