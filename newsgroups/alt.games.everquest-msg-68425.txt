Windows 98 was not designed to work with more then 256mb of memory a way
around this is to go into system properties in the file system and change
from desktop computer to the Network Option. If the problem still exists
your memory may not be compatible with your current memory modules. (PC100
and PC133) styles are not all totally compatible with one another
