Good suggestions. :)

Here's some info for you.  I don't think I really became a gnome god until
the low 20s (51 now).  Here's some things I've learned.

Mem Blur doesn't.  Well, not always.  In fact, it fails way too often (in my
experience, 1/3 to 1/2 of the time).  Mez has a better and better shot of
mem blurring as you get your new mezzes.  Reoccurring Amnesia (level 44 or
49, I forget) isn't much better than level 12 or 16 Mem Blur.

Enchanters are often bullies...well, ok, "assertive" might be a better word.
When I'm being nice I say stuff like "Pick ONE please!"...and I might spam
that a little to get their attention.  Your macro telling folks what's
memmed is a great idea.

Use Periscope View (F9 once) to look down on the fight with multiple
critters.   It's a hell of a lot easier targeting the one in back than
trying to run around a fat barbarian to position the critter so it's now in
front.

Don't be afraid to jump into the fight to cast AE stun.  At level 20 you get
your 2nd stun spell (research only).  Create a STUN hotbutton.  Let's say
your 2 stuns are the first two spells (1 and 2).  Create  a social that
says:

/cast 1
/cast 2

Use the social instead of the spell icon...that way you'll get *11* spells
on your first palette.  Hit the button once, it does /cast 1 and gives you
an error on the 2nd line (/cast 2).  You immediate hit it again and you get
an error on the first line (has not recovered yet) and it casts the 2nd
stun.

Don't cast ANY AE spells inside Unrest unless you're very familiar with that
area.  For instance, it's PROBABLY safe in the basement/torture chamber area
(haven't tested) but in the big hall you'll get all sorts of stuff coming
after you from above.

AE stuns save a cleric's mana, saves yours (they're cheap), is VERY low
taunt, and gives you time to mez, root, or run.

As to damage dealing, if you're soloing if you mem up your 2 highest nukes
you CAN do a decent amount of damage.  I'm NOT saying that enchanters should
ever start thinking they're wizards but the root/nuke thing works pretty
well while soloing.

Oh, btw, don't worry too much about mezzing yourself.  It'll happen...lots
of times.   Either you'll mez everything along with yourself (which is a
good time to have a seat to med, btw) or one will resist you and hit you.
As you WELL know, mez is broken if a critter (including yourself) are hit.
Just stun & mez the last one.

Mezzing'll get easier when you get your level 20 stun.

Oh, and PLEASE...educate your tanks that THEY ARE NOT TO SAVE THE LIFE OF
THE CLERIC.  That's YOUR job.  THEY ARE NOT TO SAVE *YOUR* LIFE.  That's the
job of the cleric.
