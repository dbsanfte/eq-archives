You most likely will have to build faction, doesn't take too long in the
Warrens.

If you jump down the pit you will die and be in a spot in the hole which
will make it very difficult getting your corpse back don't do it.

Once you have faction a high indiff ask the Skelly guards at the evevator in
paineel for the Key.

You will be able to purchase the key to the Hole at a low dubious or by
using sneak.
apporx price is 100p
