Aye, but mages do get at least fire and magic-based nukes.  Also get DoTs 
and DS and it seems to work pretty well.

Yeah, that may be (do mages get lure-based nukes?), but I can't think of a 
single fight where wizards can hit but mages can't.  A mage certainly 
won't do as much damage as a wizard with <foo>bane, and while it may be 
more efficient in a perfect setup to have mages make lvl56 modrods for the 
<foo>bane wizards, I can't see it working out that well in actual battle.
