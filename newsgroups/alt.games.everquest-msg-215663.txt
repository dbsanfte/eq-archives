Man what the hell do I have to do? I need to get a yellow lizard scale for
each piece of the armor (total of 7). I started out at 1 bub into level 4 I
am now 3.5 bubs into level 5 and I have killed nothing but lizards (ok an
occasional froglok but that's it) and I have got a total of 2 yellow lizard
scale ( I did buy one for a total of 3). I am seriously thinking of saying
to hell with this but I need that armor as I can't afford anything better.
Man this SUCKS.

Rant Over...

PS. If anyone has some yellow lizard scales they want to sell please sent me
a tell, thanks.
