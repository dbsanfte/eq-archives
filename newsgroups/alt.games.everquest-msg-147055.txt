It will make everyone happier on raids if everyone can share in the
experience (talking raids that take a lot of killing of smaller
monsters). Even if its not the full experience of what a normal 6
person group would get, it would be worth it.

Quie a bit of raid resentment comes when one group is getting most or
all of the kills, a very common situation. 'its not about the
experience' might work for the first few raids but the truth is if
you're going to spend a few hours somewhere killing mobs its better to
make as many people happy as possible and giving experience would do
that.
