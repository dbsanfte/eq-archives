I hate being rude to people, but I do agree that you have to find out their
plan first before joining.  It's one thing if you're running past Orc Hill
in the GFay, and some people on the hill throw you an invite.... that one's
fairly obvious.
But other 'drive by' invites have lead to unwanted faction hits and corpse
runs in places I was unfamiliar with.  Not fun.
