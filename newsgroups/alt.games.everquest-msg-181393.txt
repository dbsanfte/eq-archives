find a board somewhere, populate it, and play.

You can get a populated (barebones) NForce board with an XP1500+ and
512M RAM for very little. Onboard 6x AGP GeForce2 w/64mb VRAM (Separate
from system ram, too) handles about every zone quite nicely.

Great game board, and best bang for your buck now that the NForce2 is
out and has been for a bit.
