    Plaguebone thieves in the Combine ruins in Dreadlands. At level 40 my
necromancer can mow them over no problem, and some of them are even cons to
her. By level 44 it's my understanding you can slow them with Shackle of
Spirit and just let the pet beat them to death without Panic the Dead. That
should give you plenty of time to watch for others, which is good as I
imagine the zone is fairly high traffic. They don't assist one another.
