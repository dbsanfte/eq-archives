What are the basic rules for a high level and low level playing
together, ie. powerleveling? Does the lower char have to do 50% of
damage? And what about pets? Specifically, I have a 48 iksar sk and am
thinking of getting a second account and makin a druid for her to
partner with. But the new druid will be 48 levels behind so I'm
wondering if sk can help him out.Or better to have another char at
same level as druid on the other account to play with until both are
into 40's? Can sk pet help out the druid- sic the pet on mob while
kiting- or will lower char not get exp?
Any tips on 2-boxing and powerleveling appreciated.
