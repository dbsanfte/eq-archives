Don't kid yourself, Verant isn't doing this to make it so the poor newbies have
an easier time of it. They are doing it to increase the overall difficulty
further and make it so you have to start yet another twink if you want
something.

They certainly aren't becoming pro newbie, Velious just obliterates that idea.
Where were the newbie zones in Velious? (They don't exist.)

Odds are the additional character advancement methods being introduced with
Luclin will keep alot of people in the end stages of EQ, interested.

My problem is Verant increasingly wants to make the high level game more
difficult. They added the green mob aggro, they added no drop so you couldn't
easily pass stuff off to twinks, soft codes to make items less useful on twinks,
now they're making it so you have to be a certain level just to get the loot.

Where does it end? Isn't the idea behind leveling that you get more power and
gain more abilities? As opposed to nothing ever getting easier? Are they next
going to say you can only get items if you're in a full group?
