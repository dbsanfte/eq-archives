My two cents, I don't own it but  a friend let me try out his tanker for a
couple of hours.

Yes, in a 'somewhat new experience' kind of way.

If you have $50 to blow on it and enjoy new things, sure. I imagine you'll
get your money/entertainment value out of it in a month. After that it's
what... $15 monthly?
> How complex is the game compared to EQ?
Significantly less at the level most people are at the moment... as time
passes I expect the true subtleties and complexities of interaction between
the character types will become more apparent.

Are you a hardcore raider type? No. Soloer? Somewhat likely. Group with
friends type? Possibly. Loot collector? probably not. Alt fanatic?
Perhaps... it has plenty of character slots.

My absolute biggest problem with the game is the 'The City' (from The Tick)
feel to it. You can't zip down the street at super speed without bouncing
into a dozen or more heroes. I mean, here you have a city with a super
powered hero to mundane ratio approaching 1:1. WTH would ANY villian set up
shop here?

But it does look fun. If you don't struggle for cash I think you can buy it
and not want to hurt yourself afterward. Unlike say, watching Star Trek:
Nemesis, where I wanted those 2 hours of my life back (fortunately, someone
loaned me the DVD, so I was only out the time I could have spent more
productively... say, going though my penny jar looking for Canadian
pennies.)
