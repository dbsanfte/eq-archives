KEI would help, but you specifically do *not* get sitting mana regen when
on a horse/lizard if you are attacking, and Yaulp will not cast if you
are mounted. So if you are meleeing it's much better to dismount. You wind
up with better mana regen *and* haste *and* the Yaulp DEX bonus.

Basically, mounted melee combat is a bad idea for a cleric.

Nuking them down isn't very efficient time-wise. The medding time winds
up exceeding the time saved. At least for me, and Monual is probably
better at melee than my cleric (Geona, level 57) is... though he also
likely has much better mana regen than I do too. :-)
