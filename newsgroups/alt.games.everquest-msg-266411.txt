Question: suppose your guild does stick together, and eventually defeats
all of the current high end EQ stuff...then what?  Presumably, there will
be another expansion or two, and there will be even higher end stuff, so
you'll move on to that, right?

Well...how is that logically different from starting over in WoW or EQ2?  A
new high end expansion to EQ means there are zones and mobs that are too
tough for you, so you have to get stronger, and perhaps figure out new
strategy and tactics.  Isn't that exactly the same situation you'd be in
starting in WoW or EQ2?

It seems to me that you are dismissing the idea of playing another game too
easily.
