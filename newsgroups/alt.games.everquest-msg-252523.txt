Can I offer some advice?

Take out the last pause and sit commands. There will be times(many, and 
more the higher you get) when you need to duck out of a cheal and cast 
something else, and you will want your macros available. If you duck out of 
that CH, you will find yourself unable to use your hotkeys until that pause 
has run out. Also, sitting at the end of the cast like that is begging for 
aggro in many dungeons and situations.
