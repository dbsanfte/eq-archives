I think Dark Elves will be dubious to the dwarf vendor, though--I know
I've seen him tell Ogres and Trolls to get lost, so I would imagine
he'd do the same to Dark Elves (he'll buy/sell from Iksars, however).

Also, as other people have already suggested, the mud pit in the
northeast corner of the Overthere is another great area, and there is
an Iksar vendor in that area where you can get food/drink/bandages and
other stuff and will buy from/sell to anyone.
