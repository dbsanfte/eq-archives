I need to dig it out of my archives, but somewhere around here
I've got a press release for a recent study that was done,
the conclusion of which is that incompetent people are not
only incompetent at what they attempt to do, but are also
"meta-incompetent".  That is, they are also unable to
recognize just how incompetent they are -- they typically
tend to wildly overestimate just how well they're doing...

It's probably a vicious circle -- they're too incompetent to
know that they're screwups, and at the same time they're
not going to improve any until they recognize that they
need to improve.

Lord knows such observations explain a lot of behavior that
one encounters online.

Or as a one-liner on the ancient "Red Skelton Show" put it,
"little do you know how little you know".
