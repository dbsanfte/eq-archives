It might be worth adding a warning: because the corpse is always at
your feet, it's easy to loot it by mistake if you're used to clicking
near the middle of the bottom edge of the screen to look a mob.  So
be careful if you do any additional fighting while dragging a corpse.

At least, I'm pretty sure that's what happened to me.  I was in a duo
exploring Kaesora for the first time (it's the current hot zone for
our level), and died while my buddy managed to gate out in the nick
of time.  Since he had to heal/med, I ran back first, found my corpse,
looted all but one item, and then decided to cart the body around
using /corpsedrag in case a cleric happened to turn up in the zone
while we were there.

After a while, my partner showed up and we began grinding through the
dungeon some more.  At some point, I realised that my corpse wasn't
there any more, and /corpse confirmed I no longer had a corpse in zone.
Since the item I'd left on the corpse was something typical of the zone
(e.g. a Words of X or a spider silk or whatever), I figure I must've
looted it by mistake and not even noticed.
