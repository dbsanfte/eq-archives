So here's the blueprint.  Give me a HP buff, a SOW, and a regen.
I park my pet behind the group, run out, nuke something with my
level 1 nuke, run back to group, sic pet on it.  Pet pulls it off
me, group pulls it off pet, meantime I'm running out for
another.  If I get back and the first isn't dead, I run loops
around the group till they grab the add, then run off and get
another.  Fast as I can, pull pull pull.  If there's any trouble,
I stop pulling and burn out a large chunk of mana speedily
killing the large mob, if thats the problem, or DS the MA if
they've got a bunch beating on them at once.

Pull rate is controlled because the group can tag my pulls when
they like, I'm happily kiting the mob around till they do, so
they never get really overwhelmed.  I'm contributing to the
fights pretty much as I always do; I don't normally do a lot of
nuking, saving up mana for the hard kills; I'm doing one nuke per
mob as usual, its just that its a very tiny mob, because since I
never get to sit I don't regen mana very fast.  But is that 200
damage per mob really all that important?  Pet is still in there
swinging on most mobs, so I'm getting most of my normal share of
damage in.

But whats really happening is similar to what happens with any
other character I pull with; I'm supplying about twice as many
mobs per hour as any average puller will do, because I'm not
sticking around to fight, and because I'm not forgiving of healer
mana; if the healers start to complain, I pull smaller mobs for a
while to let them catch up, but I try not to ever actually stop
pulls, we constantly have mobs on deck, full bore slaughter at
maximum capacity of the group.

One thing I was thinking of changing, I could add an AE nuke to
my spell lineup.  This way if the group is overrun by too many
mobs, I could not only DS, but smack all the adds; since I've
pulled them in the first place and since they aren't being hit by
the party (which is concentrating on one target at a time) they
may peel off and come to me, which would mean I could relieve
pressure on the group and kite the mobs around till they are
ready for them, or else they might not peel off, in which case
I'd be doing AE damage to them all, nice efficiency.  (not a PB
AE, I'm not suicidal; just a standard 4 target crowd buster)

I started out using my air pet for this (I use him a lot in
groups, since his low HP doesn't matter much, and his stun proc
acts as a sort of a slow and provides interrupts if we happen to
get casters), but got into trouble; since I'm using the pet to
pull mobs off me, if the group is slow in getting the attention
of the mob, the air pet often died.  Did I mention everything I
was pulling was red to me?  Plus he wasn't really sticking stun
very well anyway.  So I switched to Earth pet; his roots didn't
stick much so that wasn't a problem, and his higher HP total
meant he was a lot better at living thru the "oops" moments.  I
don't have the 29 water or fire pets, water would be better than
earth since I have the Stein that would give him same HP as
earth, but he has better avoidance and a damage proc instead of
the worse than useless (in this situation) root proc.

Well, I've been 30 for several weeks now, soloing occaisionally
during my limited play time, and losing as much exp to deaths as
I was gaining from the soloing.  Grouped for about 4 hours,
pulling like mad, got three levels and a good chunk of the fourth
done.  OT isn't a great exp zone, but the volume and level of the
kills, plus the six man group bonus, seemed to make up for that.
