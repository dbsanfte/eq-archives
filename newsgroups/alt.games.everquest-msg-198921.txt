Please explain.  I would like to know the logic behind your claim that
the mere use of neutral wording in and of itself serves to remove his
comments from their context.  Pretending to not be insulting is not the
same as not being insulting.

Excuse me?  They lumped themselves, I merely noted that fact.  At least
they were honest enough to not be pretending innocence like Clydefrog,
Beebo insulted me directly and Lief agreed with him.  As for hurting my
