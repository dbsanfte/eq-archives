I note you never answer this question.

Only an idiot hs never seen unexpected pathing or AI changes in a patch.

Really.

So you run *precisely* the same routes from A to B on each and every pull? 
Because I can tell you there are many places in Norrath where running a 
little to the left or right can make a huge dogleg in the mobs pathing.

Your guild lets you pull elemental mobs when the cleric is at 20%? Or do 
they enforce some common fucking sense?

You don't know mana pool, though. When I say "20m", you don't know if thats 
2 CHs or barely a cele. These things differ from cleric to cleric.

I guess you've never been trained by some other moron? I suppose, also, 
you've never had an unfortunately timed LD, or Virtue on the MT drop 
midfight? A runner resist snare? Had a POP mob resist slow a time or two, 
thus either causing the cleric to heal more or causing the cleric to heal 
the chanter or shammy?

Only idiots do not leave themselves a reserve of mana for contigencies.

The only way it is "faster", as you claim, to pull at 20m than at 60m or 
some other sane amount is that you can kill an extra few mobs (however many 
you can kill in a chain using the amount of mana between, say, 60 and 20) 
at the front of the grind. While grinding, the mana regen is the same at 
either level, and you run the risk of deaths/wipes, which in the long run 
slow your pull rate down by a lot more than you stand to gain.

Untrue. I can think of many places where 1 level in difference can be the 
difference between pulling a single and puylling, say, 5.

Oh, OK. I assumed that SoW was still outdoors only.

Personal attacks alone? Gee, I thought I was illustrating instances where 
your methods invite ruin.
