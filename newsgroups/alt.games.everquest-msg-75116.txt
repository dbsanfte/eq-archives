Not quite the right place to post but what the eck

got new monitor (well 2nd hand free, new to me)

Can't seem to get enough brightness out of it.

In game with gamma on full its almost playable, so long as i dont enter a
tunnel. bit tricky at night too.

changing gamma through my graphics card out of game in display options seems
to do the trick out of game, but has no effect in-game.

Is my monitor simply knackered or am I simply missing something ?

Cheers.

Kev.
