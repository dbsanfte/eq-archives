Yes, that's true, especially since LDoN enforces a fairly tight range of
levels within groups. Anyone doing LDoN adventures regularly will quickly
start seeing the same players (I've only done a half-dozen myself and
already had several repeat groupmates). So a credible expectation of social
consequences from bad behavior is definitely there.

If the routine use of a "LDON" chat channel becomes widespread on the
servers, one good use of it is for quick and easy spreading of the word that
player Dipstick likes to ninja loot even when told to stop. Serverwide LDoN
ostracizing, in other words (with all the potential for misuse that any such
public shaming mechanism brings with it, of course).
