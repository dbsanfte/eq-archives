ok, some things on shaman combat skills
- your skill only goes up by 4 per level
- whenever you reach your max for the level, switch weapon
- try to keep 2HB maxed, there are a lot of very nice 2HB weapons
around that you can get for very cheap (or pick up as "no drop"
rotting)
- at the end it doesn't matter, at 50 or so you will have your spear,
and find out that mellee damage is neglible due to our low skill cap
compared to mellee classes
