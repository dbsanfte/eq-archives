You know, you are exactly right. the majority of the post were "we can understand
that sometimes...". Of course, they were titled, "Quite LIEING to us Verant." and
"Stop being a LIAR" and "Necessary patch or another lie?" Of course, those titles
lead to a normal rational discussion as to the nature of a scheduled normal patch
that occurred on Monday. And a normal reasonable responce to a question about
standard downage.

Sad part is that anyone that really bother about looking things up and understanding
why something is occurring would reasonably seen that the servers were down for patch
application and understood. Even sadder is the fact that those that get upset about
servers being down on a normal scheduled and posted patch day are really to attached
to a GAME and really need to seek professional help for their addiction. If a person
cannot go one day a week without EQ (not even 1 day, but about 8-10 hours), they have
some serious absesion problems that may require medical treatment.
