Hitpoints are great, but it's hitpoints _and_ the defensive disciplines
that make a difference why warriors are the tank for an end-stage
mob.  For a normal exp grind, a 59 SK is just as good as a main
tank as a 59 WAR.  For one of the 'Durs, the SK will die quickly.
Hps are nice, but watch an enchanter buffed up with some top-o-
the-line buffs and have almost (I said "almost") as many hitpoints
as a rogue...but guess who would last longer under abuse (I said
"under abuse" to mean "No, dammit, I'm not talking about if that
AoE mez sticks").
