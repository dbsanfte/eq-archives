Yep.

Sometimes.  Often enough, at least in the campaigns I played in, we
had all sorts of extraneous goings on "in the night", and smart
casters never went to bed manaless if they could possibly help it.

Semantics.  The error was in the analysis, not the design.  To the
outsider the distinction means little, to the people doing the work
it is often huge.  It is far different from the other examples you
give.  The original design was very obviously not meant for use
during combat (no chat, the only way to "wake you up" in-game is
to let you get hit!).  The no-chat version was, obviously, too awful
for words, so they allowed chat.  This, of course, made it very much
easier to use in combat, so players did.  Once it became the norm to
meditate during combat players began to whine about not being able
to see anything.  You are looking at the ability from the perspective
of how it was used, which is far different from how it was designed.
It's tremendously easy to speak in hindsight about what should have
been obvious.  But somebody once defined genius as the ability to see
the obvious before anybody else... the original EQ design team saw a
lot of things, and got lucky on more than a few things, and changed
the game to suit their players as they went... but they didn't see
how Meditate would work out.  And they spent the next two years
beefing up melees to not be so horribly weak compared to casters,
which comparative weakness was due to the near constant use of the
Meditate skill!
