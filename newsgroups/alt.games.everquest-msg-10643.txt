Found this Info on www.eqmaps.com ...................

Here's the low-down on those new NPCs:

Approx LOC was 1000, -11000

Maligar - Red to lvl 34, blue to level 51 - Erudite Wizard?
Alzekar Kerda - blue to lvl 34 - Human SK?
Thurgen Thunderhead - blue to level 34 - Barbarian Warrior?
Nenika Lightfoot - blue to level 34 - Human SK?

They are all aggressive toward me and my factions are good. They reside on
the north wall of the zone between the treant spawn and the ogres.
