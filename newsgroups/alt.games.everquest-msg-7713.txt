Sort of.

You will need one (1) of the items that you're looking for.

What you do is find something in the visible inventory that you can easily
deplete, either because it's cheap, or because you think there aren't that
many in stock, and buy them all.  This leaves an open spot in the merchant's 
inventory.

Then sell the thing that you're looking for (spider silk, HQ bear pelt,
rune of rupturing, whatever).

If the merchant has none in stock, it will appear in the open slot.  Buy it
back and move on to the next merchant.

But if the merchant has some in stock, the open spot will remain empty,
because the thing you sold was placed with the existing inventory off the
bottom of the list.

Then you have to start depleting the merchant's inventory until the stuff
you're looking for pops up from the bottom.
