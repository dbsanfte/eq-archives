Improved healing is a random 1-20% increase, I think. 

Extended Blessing (if that's the 10% aug from LDoN) will work with
your 'Heal over Time' spells. 

Extended Enhancement and the shawl won't work because the base spell
duration for the heals is too short, they're limited to spells that
have a base duration of over 48(?) seconds.
