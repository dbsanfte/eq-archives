Of course its not hand painted. Hand painted is static. The terrain in
is dynamic to an extent and has the potential to be even more so once
they get the start flaws ironed out.

I like it. It's not the most beautiful but it doesn't distract me and
I have found some moments of "hey look at that".

Yes you do have to and yes there are lots. There is practically no
downtime and I without playing beta or knowing anyone in game had my
first character get to 27 in three half days. 
PVE is not the purpose of the game though.

The engine loads things at different speeds. When you enter a house
the interior furnishings can pop up a few seconds later and rubber
band you back. True.

It's not boring to me and is immerssive so far.

Very little player physics? What you talking about willis?

If someone really thinks they are in one of these games they belong in
a hospital eating green jello.
