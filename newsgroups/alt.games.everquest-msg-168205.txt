    With Blessed Armor of the Risen, Virtue, Talisman of the Brute or Boar
(both cap my STA), and SV/Brell's, I'm just over 5500 HPs. If it's going to
be a short fight I'll go with Focus of the Seventh over BAotR, and then I'm
in the mid-5700's. So far there's only one caster in my guild that's at 6 K
raid buffed, the shaman I'm competing with for most HPs. And I will catch
him. Oh yes, I WILL catch him!!!

    James
