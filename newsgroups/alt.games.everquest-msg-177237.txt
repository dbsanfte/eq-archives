In my humble opinion it seems that the Plane of Knowledge tome-travel 
system is ruining EQ.  It takes away the mystery of the distant cities.  
When you are in Qeynos you never get the feeling that you are far away 
from Freeport or Faydark because they're just a minute away.  Nobody 
even waits for boats anymore!  Remember back when people would make the 
dreaded run from Qeynos to Freeport at level 1 to be with their friends?  
Remember back when the docks were full and it was a thrill if some 
condescending wizard or druid will give you a free teleport?  Norrath is 
losing its fill of vastness with all this easy travel.  Remember back 
when you were a low-level individual and you had to work your way from 
Freeport, through the dreaded haunted Kithikor woods at night then 
through Riverdale and then risk your life with a run through Runnyeye?  
Norrath was BIG back then.  Travel was time-consuming.  It made things 
more realistic.  It added challenge to the game.  Things are getting way 
to easy.  Remember back when the Feerot was soooo far away from the rest 
of civilization?  Not anymore, its just 10sec away from any major city 
in the world.  I am not happy with this tomes AT ALL !

Well, now that they have the tomes installed I guess they might as well 
yank the boats from the game.  I think it was a good thing for people to 
wait for the boats and endure the lengthy boat rides.  It promoted more 
a feeling of "you are there" and made one appreciate the length of the 
journey one was taking.

-- one saddened EQ lover.
