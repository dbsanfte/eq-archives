Chances are there is a jumper on your motherboard that disables
onboard video.  The BIOS probably just reports the status of it.  Get
the manual that came with your machine and find the jumper layout.  If
you don't have the manual, it can probably be found on the 'net.  It
may also be labled as such on the motherboard itself.  I'd recommend
agains changing jumper settings randomly though.  Make sure you have a
good idea what you're changing.
