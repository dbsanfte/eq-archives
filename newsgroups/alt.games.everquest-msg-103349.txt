Personally I think it has more to do with the general disgust felt
towards "assling dr00ds" by many players, a feeling which has grown
over a period of a couple years.  Note that this has nothing to do
with halflings per se, just a very noticeable minority of those who
play them.

Levels one thru nine have become a lame joke.  Would've made more sense
to just start people at L10 (or at least offer the option of skipping
ahead).  If you're gonna turn L1 thru L9 into a no-risk tutorial, why
even bother to require it of anybody?

The problem they've created is that there is very little gear anymore
that it makes sense to hunt for yourself, especially in the old world,
except at very high levels.  If you are strong enough to get gear by
killing the mob(s) (or doing the quest), it is likely that you bought
something better two or three gear upgrades ago.  And that's ignoring
twinking.  It's pretty sad really.
