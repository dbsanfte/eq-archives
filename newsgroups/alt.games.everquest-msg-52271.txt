You and I would be in total agreement if it weren't for the fact that
you're talking about *a* camp *spot* (singular) and the OP was talking
about some jerk holding down three different areas. If you have the guns
to hold down five different spawn points, and nobody else is around to
hunt them, then I say, Fine. Go for it. But if you want to "camp"
something, by definition that means you'd better be there, watching it,
and ready to go when the spawn pops, or I won't respect your claim.  So
long as you're staying there tending it and legitimately camping it, I
won't even ask to share, or when you'll be done, etc. I'll just go on my
way. But if I show up and there's nobody there, invis or otherwise, then
as far as I'm concerned, the spot is open.

Brings back memories of this moron that I ran into many levels ago in
Upper Guk. I showed up there to spend some time farming the heart
spiders for silk for my partner's tailoring efforts. I get there and two
of the rooms have no spiders in them, but two are in full spawn. Nobody
is around. I figure, okie dokie, and start wiping out the spiders. Next
thing, some Iksar monk is up there telling me that he's got all the
spiders in all four rooms camped, but he was just away covering some
other areas he's camping as well. Huh? I figure I'll avoid trouble, and
offer to just stick to the two rooms he didnt' have cleared and he can
have the rest. (plenty of silks for both of us, I figure). So next he
starts doing a (get this) _*/OOC*_ announcement to me, and the rest of
the zone, that all four heart spider rooms, *and* the Frogloc Scrier
room (two levels below) are camped. I just laughed at him. I pointed out
that he was claiming that, including the extra frogs in the scrier's
room, *TWENTY SIX* spawn points in FIVE different rooms on two separate
levels of the dungeon were being camped by one solo farmer? Pardon the
rest of us, but is there anything, perhaps in *Lower* Guk that you
*DON'T* fucking have camped? This is how you define camping??? I don't
fucking think so, pal. He continued to bitch. I invited him to report me
and put him on ignore. Never heard anything else from him or any guide
about it.

Fortunately, I had better experiences there as well. This includes a
time I was camping the spiders alone and two lowbies came in wanting to
hunt. They asked when I would be done. I could tell they would likely
get XP for it, and it turns out that's all they wanted. We worked out a
deal where I just gave them the camp and hung around. They gave me the
silks that dropped, they got the xp and other drops, I protected them
when they got overpulls, and I killed the two bigger spiders that pop
there which they couldn't handle. Everyone was happy.
