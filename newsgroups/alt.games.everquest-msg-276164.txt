HI Pete:

Thanks for the advice and suggestions. But, I will be only copying 
documents, files, pictures, etc, not installed programs. I did consider 
cloning, however, my current setup is a dual boot...C drive is an old 98 SE 
setup and D drive is my currrent Win XP Home setup. So, I figure if I try to 
clone a "D" drive setup to a new "C" drive I would be asking for trouble.
