Hail All..
When I first started playing EQ I was asked to join a new
quild and being new to the game I joined right away..
well now I would like to leave the quild.
I have used the command in the Manual that is supposed to allow me to quit
but it says "I am not an officer"and will not let me.... Does any one know
the new way to quit a quild? I have asked the quild in  different ways to
let me go and get no answer.
thanks
Colla
