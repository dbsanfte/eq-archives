There is one thing I haven't seen mentioned throughout this thread.  You 
also lose everything in the bank.  Platinum pieces will do you no good 
unless it's changed into something useful quickly.

One other thing.  The POK books will transport you to the succor point 
of that zone.  A possible escape route.

Oh, and hide does work for a rogue.  It just doesn't work very well.  A 
level 8 bard attacked my level 6 rogue after I'd finished off a mob with 
3/4 health left.  I ran until I had about 1/4 health when I remembered I 
had hide.  I stopped running and hit the hide key.  On the second try it 
worked and the bard did lose her focus on me.

Unfortunately I kept popping in and out of hide.  At one point I'd taken 
a couple backsteps and was behind the bard watching myself from a camera 
pop in and out of hide.  If I'd had over 20% health at that time I might 
have gotten far enough away to hide behind a tree.  But she finally 
turned around and regained focus.  She was nice enough to return most of 
my stuff, except the plat of course.
