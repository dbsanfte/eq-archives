Heh.  I stated that rogues had an easy epic, and made a slight joke on it.
If you want to go apeshit over it, thats your choice.   Which you apparently
made.

Yep.  Tries to argue that the rogue epic is not easy.    If you haven't
accepted it by now, theres no point in further discussion, and you and your
discussion is     quickly crossing the line from mildly amusing to tedious
repetition.

Aye.   You're the only one that appears to believe the Rogue quest is some
huge difficult thing.    Arguing with you further is pointless, as you appear
to be an idiot.  Idiots deserve ridicule.   I don't see how you're failing to
follow this....

Glad you like it.
