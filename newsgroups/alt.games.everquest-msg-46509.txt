People RARELY used CoH for aggro wipe.  These are such extremely rare
situations, I'd be hard pressed to think up a senerio outside of one
zone in the game where it would even be considered useful.

Keep in mind:  CoH is a 500 mana cast, takes 12 seconds to cast it and
has a 15 second hold time.

Attempting to use this in combat situation would be very unusual to
say the least.  Infact, if you're relying on the aggro wipe component
to win an encounter for your raid, I think it's time to think up
alternatives.
