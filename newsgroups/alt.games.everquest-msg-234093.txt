Of course there is the "I non understands, group again?" or "you
healing need?" and send him an invite. A guy like this wont pass up a
"fur-a-ner" patsy. More buffage and heal. Reel him in.

Throw in a couple "non" or "non understands?" make him think you are
up for another, cast a invis undead on him. Take him to the cellar,
pass a few undead. Promise good xp in broken english. You gotta keep
talking, and sound cluless, it is hard.

It works! I kited a guy around the PoK for free money and oobah
weapons when I was bored once. "I have the centi, you take" "find me
fast group a moving" "no want?"

I would suggest going all the way right and over, but if you know
where the basement pit is even better. Gotta get past a few skellies.

When a burnyai sees him, and stats whapping, then gate. The aggro down
there is pretty good and he will have fun on the CR. Without an invis
undead he will be shouting for help for a while, prolly in the PoK.
The mix of undead and live SK furbies is nasty.

Even if you die, you can always invis undead and recover. No GM would
fault you for not CRing. I know I have been on the groupmates take off
GM-doesn't-care end. If you simply state you were ignorant that
furbies didn't see them, that works too.

Of course your Karma faction takes a big hit...
