The first character I took through 30 did it in about 10-15 hours in
Cazic thule, basically two days one weekend.  My druid I seem to just
putz along with no real motivation to get through 30 like i had with my
rogue, not that there was anything other than just to say I had done so
with the rogue.  I know i should be anxious for my 34 spells, cause the
strategy changes some for druids again with the new spell circle, but
it's not motivating me.  I think cause i am kind of burned out on the
solo thing right now.
