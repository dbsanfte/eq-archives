Ooh that's a tough one....Hmm...
Play without twinking...just can't do it on Bristlebane, when things get
tough I just end up cheating.
Hopefully share a server with ppl that don't name their characters after
Wrestlers or pop stars or sexual acts...Was kind of let down in that
respect.
I guess somewhere there was this vague notion of RP, only the zones I go to
are empty and the I don't see a whole lot of it elsewhere apart from saying
season instead of level...Oh, and sheer greed destroyed that notion, today,
real quick :ï¿½)

Maybe I should become an Evil Ranger, everyone's always making Good Trolls
and D. Elves.

Besides, Rephas sent his Charmed Pet (Me) to attack an innocent
bystander...My shaman. Had it been anyone else in the zone I would have
killed them. That makes Rephas an Evil S.o.B. in my book, Hadden is Rephas'
Ally therefore, by the rules NPC's are governed, Hadden is evil too...There
you are, Justifiable homicide, your 'onor.
