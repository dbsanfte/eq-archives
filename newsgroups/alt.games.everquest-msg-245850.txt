 i saw some loot drop, nothing major

there were two very odd things about this event

first, npcs killing npcs left corpses (normally they poof)

second, i was non-kos to all the npc's - until i sat down ...then they
hunted me

i conned them standing ...indiff....sat, suddenly kos

all mobs were blue to 65 ...some light blue....and meldrak the malevolent
gnome was yellow...he didn't respond to hails

strange event, oh well
