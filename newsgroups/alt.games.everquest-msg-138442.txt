I say cut to the chase and feel that you've accomplished something
now.
That way, you can now feel like you can make a decision about where to
go
next, and review what you've done so far.  If you thought about it
long
enough, you might decide that you're really tired of your class and
want
to try something different... instead of grinding another 30 (or
whatever)
levels with something you feel like you must do rather than enjoy
doing.

I also say this because 60 is only a number, and that even at 60 there
are plenty of things to do ... more AA points, nice equipment, working
on advanced tactics,
doing min/max raids, etc.  60 is not magic.
