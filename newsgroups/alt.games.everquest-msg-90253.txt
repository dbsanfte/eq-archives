No, at any given time you get an addition HP boost of the form
"current level * current_STA * some_multiplier", but it's not calculated
at the moment you level, it's just stacked on top of whatever
your HP would have been without the STA.

So you get a lifelong HP boost from your original starting STA,
plus a temporary HP boost from whatever STA gear you happen to
be wearing at the moment (and the latter goes away if you take
off the STA gear).
