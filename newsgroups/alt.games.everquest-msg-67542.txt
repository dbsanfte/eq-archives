If true, thank the gods. This was a real pain in the arse. If I forgot
to exit completely after logging or linkdeath, I would have to CTRL-ESC

After patching today and logging in, I got a popup message warning me
that my Luclin files were not found in the Everquest directory and
this may cause me problems. Funny, Luclin works fine for me, slow
