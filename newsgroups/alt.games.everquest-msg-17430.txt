There are a couple of things to do.  I too have a problem if my second
computer tries to patch through Windows Internet Connection Sharing
running on the first computer.  I get something from the EQ patch
program mentioning a z_stream error.  My guess is that they are using
zLib for compression, and ICS is causing data corruption (z_stream error
is the error zLib gives for corrupted data)  (I'm guessing they are
using zLib because basically everyone who does not want to spend a lot
of money for absolutely state-of-the-art compression uses zLib, since it
is very good and free :-)).

Here are some ways around the problem.

#1. If you can move your modem or whatever to the second computer
temporarily, do that long enough to let it patch.

#2. If something about your setup makes it impractical to give the
second computer a temporary connection, try some different connection
sharing software on the first computer.

There are commercial Windows connection sharing programs.  Perhaps one
of them has a free demo version you could try?  Another possibility is
to temporarily put Linux on the first computer.  This is not as drastic
as it sounds, because RedHat 7.1 includes an option for a
"partitionless" installation.  If you select a partitionless install,
all you have to have is an existing FAT/FAT32/VFAT filesystem, and RH
7.1 will make a couple of large files in the root of that partition, and
make a virtual disk using one of those (the other is for swap), and
install on that.  It will make you a boot floppy that you then use
whenever you want to boot Linux.  As far as your existing Windows is
concerned, nothing is disturbed on your system...you've just got a
couple of large files in the root.  If you ever want to get rid of
Linux, just delete those two files.  Linux IP masquerading works just
fine with Everquest.

#3. You can do the patch yourself.  Turn off connection sharing and let
the first computer patch.  Then just copy all the files other than any
..opt or .ini files from the Everquest direction on the first computer to
the Everquest directory on the second computer.  Turn sharing back on,
and play on both computers.
