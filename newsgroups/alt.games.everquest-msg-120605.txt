Yeah, Verant should look at that.  The druid's portal rarely has a
wanderer...and most druids that ports there will have SoW to escape.  Poor
wizards have a spot that at least 2 critters roam through (I was hit with 2
yesterday).

I do have to say that except for yesterday I had decent luck at the wizard
portal lately.

BTW, evac spot in SF is the OT zone line...comes in damned handy. :)  Any
time I port anyone there on our way to Howling Stones I tell them "when we
get to SF be ready for a fight.  Get aggro of any critter that comes nearby
and stay close to the wizard...you won't die in those 10.25 seconds it takes
to cast Evac."
