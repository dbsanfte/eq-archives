Hmmm, what level is your enchanter?  I see Dictate used a TON, but
only on unmezzable (56+) mobs.

As a necro your charm spells are generally going to be a grouping
tool.  A necro can do a pretty good job of handling adds in undead
dungeons if they can charm the first add and sic him on the 2nd add,
while the rest of the group takes out the first mob.  If you get a 3rd
add I guess you hope you can root/park him or get him mad at your pet
too.  I rarely see necros use charm soloing, unless it's to break a
tough spawn.  That said, I do know two guild necros who solo Frenzy in
Lower Guk by charming one of the other undead froggies and letting him
clear it out for them.  Once they get it broken then generally spin up
a regular pet though.

Arolpin
hates letting necros do CC, anyone who likes starting a fight 40m and
40h just scares the rest of the group
