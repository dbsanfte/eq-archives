    Yes and no. No, you can't have two identical items up for different
prices. Yes, you could have two items that are identical *except for number
of charges* at different prices. Also, if someone is browsing you and you
attempt to change the price on something, the browser will get a message
that the price has changed and could they please leave and re-click on the
vendor if they want to purchase it. So no sneaking a price change in that
way. If you were devious, you could set yourself up so you could see all
people heading your way, and as soon as someone heads towards you change the
price on your "loss leader" item. But then you have to hope that they have
enough plat on them to pay the inflated price, and that they don't
double-check the price.
