    We don't worry - there's so many damned time sinks that we never want
for things to do. And we haven't even done anything with killing Lord Seru
other than collect a bunch of Serubane components as we find them.

    We were in the first wave of new servers after opening, so we're in the
same boat as you age-wise. Oldest unsplit servers out there.

    Look at the changed ST on Legends - the zone is being converted to an XP
zone by the sounds of it. What you just said is the future.

    Funny you should mention AoW. Last night the other two big guilds got in
a real war trying to get him, this while we're killing AL, HP, and being
given the loot from Blood to let someone else have a shot at Emperor.

    Our guild can kill anything outside of Vex Thal, excluding Seru. Vis
Maior can kill anything we can kill, except Emperor (their last attempt
yesterday got him to 94% and they have a lot of wizards - you do the math).
Wraith can kill anything Vis can kill except Shei (they just got Cursed last
night, using our strategy, after a one hour long fight with him). The Asian
guild, Eternal Holiday, can kill anything of Grieg difficulty or less and
has started trying Creator in Ssra (which also tells us they're farming keys
there). Explicit, the breakoff guild from Vis, has taken on some people and
can get AoW to 30-40%, so it's a matter of time. They can kill anything that
doesn't take numbers, as they're still quite small (40 characters max with
all the bots online). Rel In Por used to be at about the same level as the
Asian guild, but they lost a few members to Explicit so I'm not sure what
they can do any more. A group of guilds known collectively as "The Alliance"
clears NToV, but they almost never raid EXCEPT to do NToV - no Luclin
bosses, but all of Velious (excepting AoW and Tunare). And there's one more
guild just moving into NToV now, but which hasn't to our knowledge done any
Luclin bosses.

    So our situation is similar to yours. Anything that's high-end is split
between us, Vis, and Wraith. Anything of Grieg difficulty or lower will not
be up if we leave it up overnight, as Eternal Holiday will likely kill it
(they're very efficient - we admire how well they do with the numbers and
class makeup they have). Explicit and Rel In Por pick off whatever they can
find up, knowing that if they leave it up they'll lose it overnight. Only
the upper-end mobs used to stay up any length of time, and now that we kill
stuff like AL and HP flawlessly that doesn't stay up long.
