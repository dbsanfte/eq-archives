The "best" is the class that you enjoy playing the most. No one can
decide that for you. You have 8 character slots....Try the
races/classes you are interested in, and see which you like the best.

From a purely game mechanics standpoint....Good Soloing classes (in no
particluar order)
Necro (starting at level 1)
Mage (starting at level 4)
Druid (starting at level 14)
BeastLord (starting at level 9)
Shaman (starting at level 24)

Misty is a great starting zone, and there are some fun new armor
quests for Halfling Druids.

All Magician's are good soloers. Race does not really matter for
Mages, since they rely mostly on thier pets.

Vah Shir (Cat People) can be Shamans, and they are a Good/Nuetral
race. You need to have the Luclin expansion (and a powerful PC) to
play a Vah Shir.

For a new player I would say that Magician is the easiest to learn how
to play with.
