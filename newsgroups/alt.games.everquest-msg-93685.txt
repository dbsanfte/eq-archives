I used to have the same problem with my wizard.  The Mob used to
aggro on me so much it wasn't even funny.  I used to be the puller
for the group by medding.  Never failed, I med, Mobs come a knocking.
 Anyways back to the point at hand.  If it's at all possible take a
step back and see if you are more suited for support or melee in the
group.  Snare is great for slowing the enemy down.  Less hits from
the Mob and when u need to get away, no problem.  When you get far
enought away, it'll stop following you and attack the tank.  My best
advice, pummel the crap out of the Mob and when he aggros you and you
can't handle it, run at least 20 steps back but, never if you have 2
bubbles left, run way before then or the mob will never stop chasing
you.  when the tank finally takes the brunt of the attack again,
stand back and re-apply snare and cast on the Mob.  There might be a
better way to do it but, those are my thoughts.  It may give you an
alternate line of thinking.  Just ask your groups and see what they
think.  The important thing in any group for me is communicating to
see what exactly you have and need.  Enough tanks, np be support =3D).=20
Not enough tanks, pound the crap out of the mob and take the aggro,
that'll teach the damn tank to quit using his taunt skill at lvl 2.
