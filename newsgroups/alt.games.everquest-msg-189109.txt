Mine is fine at 300 - Ive seen friends machines and them playing on them
and the performance is not low enough in comparison to really be
problematic - when I was on a Voodoo3 and 128 RAM I had to keep the clip
plane down and the models off but doing that it functioned fine though 
I preferred Old World, with 384RAM and a geforce 2 it really is fine.

Even went on a 40 person raid ni Swamp of No Hope and Emerald Jungle and
no problems. Coupla second long freezes but friends on ninja machines were
saying the same at the time. Yes I undoubtedly could get X more textures
and N more luclin models if I kicked the machine upspec and Id be very
surprised if I sat for 100 hours and loggged problems that my machine
didnt come out with more but its not enough to describe the game as
problematic, the  game is entirely playable in any area (well except the
bazaar where things can really slow up and so on but everyone says that)
