You don't want to hear my story then.

I went there to camp him, bound myself nearby.  After 30 minutes of camping,
I got bored and left, went out had fun killed things.  Gated back, camped
out.  Logged in next morning before going to work, and there was Dyllin.
Followed him down by the water killed him, got my page.  Elapsed time 5
minutes.  I am probably the worlds worst camper, I just can't bring myself
to sit there bored to death waiting for some stupid mob to pop.  Yes, I
could read a book or something, but I'd rather play.
