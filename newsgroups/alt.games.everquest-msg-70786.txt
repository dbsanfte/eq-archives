Total crap. I'm not talking about p/u groups either. I'm talking about a
46 lvl min guild. The cleric gets the crap gems, valuable as they may
be. Some days they get screwed. Some days they get rich. The other
people generally get the really cool shit that drops that clerics can't
usually use. (And if they have an alt that *could* use it, as pointed
out in another post, NB4G means they don't get a shot if the alt isn't
in that group.) Man, you're a cheap bastard if a cleric walking out on a
rare occasion with one stinking KPP worth of gems pisses you off that
bad after they buffed you and kept your non-healing ass alive in the
middle of seventeen frogs and leezard necros in Seb for the last few
hours.
