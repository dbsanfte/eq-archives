"Oh freddled gruntbuggly,
Thy micturations are to me
As plurdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee
And hooptiously drangle me with crinkly bindwurdles
Or I will rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon
See if I don't."

Just seeing how it compared to Vogon poetry. (Apologies for errors, written
from memory).
