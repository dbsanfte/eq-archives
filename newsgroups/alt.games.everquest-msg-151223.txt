Well... if open your stat window, you can see exactly what it's doing when
you hit it.   At level 30, it is really weak, adding 1 point to every resist
for a few minutes. (hardly earthshattering).   Every two levels or so, the
amount that it does will change, so that by level 51 (52 is the first useful
discipline) it's adding about 10  to all resists.  Not bad, but still
nothing to get excited over.

If you type in /disc again, it gives you a messsage telling how long until
you are able to use your next discipline.

(If you use "/disc" instead of "/disc resistant" to check the time, less
chance of accidently blowing your discipline.  Make a hotkey to send a blank
one)
