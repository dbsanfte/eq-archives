I'm trying to get the last part of the acumen mask quest.  Went to wc and
got chased out by shadowmen green to me.  Went back with sow on and started
with bonds of force.  One shadowman resisted and chased me down and killed
me before I could get off a yonder and a gate.  A green shadowman.  I
eventually found some people to group with.  One of them needed gloves.  We
camped there for 2 hours and neither the patch or gloves dropped.
Eventually disaster struck and our tank went down.  Don't know how because
the hp's seemed to go way too fast.  I tried assist but just pulled one
cleric of many off him and now I'm soloing a cleric who keeps interrupting
me and healing himself.  And the enchanter has his own troubles.  He goes
down and I finally finish the cleric shadowman.  Our buddy who was not
grouped cause he's too high level is trying to take down the rest of them.
I couldn't help because I'm oom so he ended up running for the zone.  Lot's
of excitement but no one got what they came for.  Any advice for me?  I read
on some site that some zone's shadowmen may be more likely to drop what we
need than others.  Is this true, and which zone should I hunt for the patch?
