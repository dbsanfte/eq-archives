Note my use of the words "some" and "many".  I know some women don't
mind being called chicks.  The fact is, some don't like it, and I
don't presume to be able to tell at a glance who does, and who does
not mind.  I could also care less that you're a woman, to be perfectly
frank.  If someone doesn't like being referred to as a chick, do you
think THEY give a "bloody damn" that it's coming from another woman?
Unlikely.   As for the negative connotations *I* add to the word
"chick"...as much as I'd like to think otherwise, I just don't have
that kind of influence over society.  If you'll check around, you'll
find that negative connotations were attached before I ever got around
to replying to your post.  Ciao.
