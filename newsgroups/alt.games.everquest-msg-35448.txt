My main was given a FBR for helping with some nasty skels and some
healing, he is lvl 19 and that robe is very nice, and i was up in
thurgadin with my lvl 10 druid to buy some tizmak armor, well my 76pp
got me the leg piece and that's was it, so after a tip i wen't outside
and auctioned to buy the tunic for all my cash, some 33pp and i was
offered the tunic for free, i felt very good about it and he was lvl
54 so i guess it was just rotting in his bank account, gave me a nice
look and all :)
