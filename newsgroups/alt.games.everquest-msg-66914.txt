Sorry, I use Engorging Roots at 53rd level.  It seems to work the same as
before -- If I root it holds quite a while.  Some things are very root
resistant (such as the Ice Giant Sentinels in WL, Storm Giants -- root?
yeah right...  can't even snare the buggers half the time).

You may have run across a critter or 3 that had their MR increased.  If so,
post what you are trying to root please.
