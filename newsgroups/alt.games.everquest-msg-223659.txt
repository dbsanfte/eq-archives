Maybe its a server thing... I made it to 65 without a guild and
with mediocre gear (TOV + epics... at the time I didnt think it was
mediocre, but POP was out and I had nothing from Ssra, etc) very
fast and even now I dont really have trouble finding groups if I
want to XP... I dont wait around LFG, I try a few times, if nobody
wants me I find somewhere to set up shop solo and start inviting
folks as they LFG and become available... I realise as a rogue you
might not be able to solo so easily, but you can still form your
own groups.

Weird. Still, everyone has different experiences. Might even be a
timezone thing I guess, although as a Euro I'd have thought I'd
find it hard to get random pickups with less folks about than not...

I'd kinda always thought rogues were a 'popular' class too for
invites. I never worried about turning them away, extra ouchies
are nice.
