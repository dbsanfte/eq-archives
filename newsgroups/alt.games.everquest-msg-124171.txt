And your personal bias.  Again, you "skepticism" only seems to work one way.
The fact that there's no proof that there is a god serves as evidence that
there isn't, in your book.  Meanwhile the lack of proof that there isn't is
completely inconsequential.  That's why I scoff at your "skeptics."  They
are only skeptical in the direction that suits their own purpose.  That
isn't science.

Funny thing about pseudo-science.  What do they call it when it becomes
real?  In the early part of the twentieth century, space flight was only for
the sci-fi buffs.  It could safely be considered to be in the relm of
pseudo-science.  Two centuries ago, if I had told you that I put a chunk of
metal in a large pot, I could get out all sorts of other metals (gold being
one of them), you would have said I was talking about that crackpot
"alchemy" thing... today, I refer to it as fission.  Your "skeptics" were
wrong then, and they'll be wrong in the future.
