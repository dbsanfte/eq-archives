 It's nice they keep up with this but I really think sometimes you get a
nasty GM that's just out to get you and messes with your name or anything
else. I had a friend on Fennin Ro server that had all his names with
reference to a Myth God and they are changing all his names cause they said
he can't be camparing himself to a God. In my opinion that's nitpicky and
they need to find real problems to look out for out there. The kicker is all
his characters are 45+ and had them for a long time. Makes you wonder why
now there doing this.
 Take care all and be safe.
