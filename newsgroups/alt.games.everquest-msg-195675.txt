So the second person is good for 2% extra overall experience
The third, fourth and fifth are good for 4% extra each.
The 6th person is good for an extra 6% on top of all that.

So the 6th person does provide a larger bonus than the rest of the group.  Of
course if you don't increase your kill rate to at least keep up with the number
of people in the group you end up getting less exp per hour anyway:


Kill rate doesn't move, bad things happen to your exp rate
1 person killing 1 mob for 100 exp per person
2 people killing 1 mob for 51 exp per person
3 people killing 1 mob for 35 exp per person
4 people killing 1 mob for 27 exp per person
5 people killing 1 mob for 23 exp per person
6 people killing 1 mob for 20 exp per person

If your kills per hour are directly proportional to number of people in group
then
1 person killing 1 mob per hour for 100 exp per person
2 people killing 2 mobs per hour for 102 exp per person
3 people killing 3 mobs per hour for 106 exp per person
4 people killing 4 mobs per hour for 110 exp per person
5 people killing 5 mobs per hour for 114 exp per person
6 people killing 6 mobs per hour for 120 exp per person

I imagine Sony expects the real result to lie somewhere in between these two.
Personally I try to group such that we average more kills per hour than we
would have soloing seperately;

1 person killing 1 mob per hour for 100 exp per person
2 people killing 3 mobs per hour for 153 exp per person
3 people killing 5 mobs per hour for 176 exp per person
4 people killing 7 mobs per hour for 192 exp per person
5 people killing 9 mobs per hour for 201 exp per person
6 people killing 11 mobs per hour for 220 exp per person

Something similar can be accomplished by going after stronger mobs than the
members can take efficiently soloing (higher exp per mob instead of more mobs
per hour)

This means good groups which by supporting each other's strong points multiply
effectiveness instead of merely adding it, or in the case of the Sony theory,
adding less than 100% per person even.  Again the truth often lies somewhere
between my hope and the baseline, depending on the skills and equipment of
group members and the tactics of the group and the class mix and heck, the
sheer number of mobs available where they are working.

And sometimes it exceeds it.  I recall a couple years back sitting at the
entrance to COM soloing my cleric alongside a soloing ranger.  We weren't
either of us doing all that well, about 3 mobs in a half hour.  Then I talked
him into teaming up.  We took out 30 mobs in that same half hour (and both at
less risk of death).  Even without Verant's bonus, that was 5 times the exp for
each of us!

I've seen the same thing in well constructed AE groups, where 6 people could
easily do 10 times the exp per hour each that they could soloing... even after
subtracting out deaths :)
