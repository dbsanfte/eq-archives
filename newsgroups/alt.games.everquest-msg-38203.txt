I ran it through Copelands,and took a 30th level Pally with a base
strenght of 120.  The BABS came out at 387 dmg/minute, while the Blade
of Xalgoz (I assume that's the one you mean) did 376 dmg/minute.  It's a
slight difference, so if the 3 STR and AGI is a factor for you, you're
probably better off with that one. 
  As to cost, I'v never seen a BoX for sale, but the BABS has been going
for as low as 500 plat on Xev since the New Runnyeye farmers have been
flooding the market with them.
