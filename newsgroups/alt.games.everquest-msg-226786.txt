A) You are always going to feel bad when you lose someone, because 
you've taken the responsibility of healing the group, or even the raid, 
onto yourself.  If you didn't have at least a twinge of guilt every 
death you'd make a poor cleric indeed.

B) You will continue to lose people, in fact, you'll lose a Lot more 
people than this, as you continue on.  At higher levels the game gets 
tougher and tougher, mob power goes up much faster than player power, 
and players aren't as disproportionately "twinked" with gear that will 
let a level 20 survive fights designed for level 30s.   As rescue 
workers and hospital workers and chaplains in the real world will tell 
you, your hundredth death is a lot easier to face than your first.

C) The better your rez, the less you'll feel the pain of death.  You 
have to keep in mind that in the Everquest world, death is but a 
measurable inconvenience at worst, and the flip side of the cleric "keep 
  em alive" mentality is the one that says "ooops, lost one, rez em and 
lets keep moving".

D) In some instances, death is inevitable, in this case, you have to 
prioritize and decide Who is going to die.  This sort of Triage is one 
of the biggest drains in real life on medical personelle morale.  As a 
healer in EQ, you need this skill, nasty as it is.  In most groups, 
priority order is Mezzer, Rezzer, MT, Everyone else.  If you've got 
unmezzable mobs in camp, its Rezzer, MT, any Offtanks, Everyone else. 
If Evac has been called then its Evaccer, Corpse summoner, Rezzer, 
everyone else.  SO on and so forth.  Point is, sometimes you can't save 
them all, so you have to decide who you need the most and safe them.

E) Most groups include a backup healer.  While you -feel- the 
responsibility for all group deaths, in reality this responsibility lies 
almost entirely with the backup, NOT with the main healer.  Your job, as 
main healer, is to keep the MT alive, and do so efficiently so as to 
maximize group kill rate.  The backup healer should be the one using his 
relatively inefficient mana to save people in the group who should Not 
have aggro in the first place, or to patch heal the MT if a Cheal is 
running late.  This means he needs to conserve enough mana at all times 
to do this job, and it means he has to be paying attention for those 
times of need, not focus too much on his secondary job of killing mobs. 
  Obviously there are limits as to what the backup healer can do unless 
he's a second cleric... but within those limits (A ranger as backup 
healer is a lot less help than a paladin, and so forth) you should let 
him do all the non MT healing possible; this will conserve your mana for 
your real job, and keep him alert and interested in the healing job, for 
when its needed.

You healed enchanter, MT, before ranger.  Good prioritizing.  You 
managed to land your best heal for the situation once and had a second 
casting when the ranger died.  Death was inevitable.  You rezed him up 
90%, and group continued, he was assuredly well past his starting point 
by the time you left; death wasn't particularly painful.  Your backup 
healer was AFK; I hope he told you before doing so, if he didn't its his 
fault, if he did its the pullers fault for pulling when backup AFK... 
although the fact is none of you expected any trouble.

Oddest of all, though, is the ranger story.  Ranger pulled aggro off the 
MT.. that would be the original mob, not the roamer?  MT at 20% and a 
cheal on the way isn't cause to pull aggro usually, even it it Is a good 
idea its rarely possible due to the "Low HP Aggro" phenomenum.  Pulling 
aggro off the chanter is the other possibility but this is generally a 
bad idea, adds are the enchanter's responsibility and most things people 
try to do to "rescue" them only make matters worse.  No damage root or 
no damage stun or no damage snare or Malaise-x are good ways to help 
out, any sort of damage based response almost never is.  And then the 
ranger didn't respond to your apology; rangers should be used to death 
and understanding of the inability of healers to keep them alive, if 
they aren't they are in the wrong class.  Its likely he wasn't meaning 
to be rude, though, just stoic.
