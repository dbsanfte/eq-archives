	If I didn't mind sticking my guild with the tab when I blow it, I could go

received significant upgrades in the last year can handle bigger mobs than I
can, but they still have a limit.

|Well, "reasonable rate" just changed, didn't it?  

	Yes -- back to what it was on September 3rd.  They just rolled back the
penalty (or at least they say they did; servers aren't back up yet).

|If you want more, you move on -- same as you did from about
|level 3 on up...

	You can't.

	Your argument is only over where the line is drawn, not whether or not the
line exists.  Again: there is an END to experience progression, your ability
to kill mobs is CAPPED.  That means sooner or later, you reach a point where
experience gain is optimised and will never improve.  When you get there, you
will not move on, because there is simply no place to go.

|Some are, some aren't.  Some of the "stupid" choices just got a lot
|better.  Increased STA (more HPs), increased regen (speaks for itself),
|and so on.

	None of these abilities are going to radically improve your ability to
kill mobs.  I've already got 22 points/tick of standing regen with no regen
items; adding another 3-4 points is nice, and I will eventually do it, but it
is not going to make me suddenly able to solo much tougher mobs.  Improving my
equipment (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=211128) would have a
much more significant effect on my ability to perform in experience grinding
than anything I have yet coming in AA, and even then it won't radically
improve my solo capacity except largely in reducing downtime.
 
|Not necessarily, as I've said.  Fighting a blizzard spider now doesn't

	The guy who was fighting blizzard spiders for his AA can't fight anything
bigger.  If he could, he would.  Even the complete sheep who never go
exploring and only follow the herd will follow the herd to the best place they
can hunt without getting slaughtered.

|And the 50s just moving into
|Velks actually find some spiders here and there instead of four 60s
|soling all the spawns.

	And therein lies the crux of the argument.  It's the TCC all over again.
Wahh, level 60 characters are killing my spiders instead of zerging Vyemm, so
let's change the rules to force them to go places they don't want to go and
leave places they don't want to leave.
