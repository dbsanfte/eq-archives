Extended Temp for lowbies is ever better. Sometimes I go to CB and cast 
it on the players there. I guess it is kind of a shame to see them get 
all happy and go have all that fun for a while but oh, well. My cleric 
manages to sleep well at night somehow just the same.

I wish you could have buffs outside of groups in EQ2 myself. In EQ1 with 
the help of friendly shammies, chanters and the occasional beastlord, my 
cleric does pretty good soloing with his handy Hammer of Damnation, etc. 
I couldn't do it nearly as well without the buffs. I don't know what 
it's like to try and solo buffless in EQ2 but I am sure it would be 
easier if you had them. Although from what I have been reading there is 
quite an emphasis on grouping in EQ2, even moreso than in EQ1. So I 
guess this is just part of the overall design of the game.

Not to wander off topic too far but are there any classes in EQ2 that 
are particurlary good at soloing as was the necro in EQ1 for example?

I haven't played a necro in EQ1 but I have a feeling they could fare 
pretty well even without buffs from anyone else.
