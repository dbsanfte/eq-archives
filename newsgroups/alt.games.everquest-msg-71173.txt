>Woot! I helped kill a dragon!

My dragon story last night ended somewhat differently. My guild was
helping another guild with Faydedar. We junk buffed, buffed, got
summoned resist items, nukers stood in a corner, I was told to wait
till Fay was at 60 to nuke, and to assist heal otherwise. Fay is
triggered, I resist a couple roars, get hit by a few others and hence
slowly lose my buffs. However, Fay was being pingponged. I manage to
land a total of two heals, one on myself and one on the main tank, the
rest of my targets are 'too far away' with everyone running around.
Then I start hurting as Fay takes my fire resist, he charges me (wish
I'd had time for a screenshot. Had lots of frame rate issues last
night) and kills me with one hit. By the time I respawned outside
Sebilis orb, everyone was dead.

My guild leader was heard muttering something about some people having
to learn how to raid before we'd help them with Fay again. Personally,
I believe I'll devote some more time towards getting ghast hearts for
my Tunare symbol, in the hopes that it doesn't have a nasty cast time
and can be used to refresh junk buffs on such occasions :)
