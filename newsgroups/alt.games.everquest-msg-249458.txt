Not for me. I liked rogue spear best of the fpses... and preferred 4 vs 
4 over any other format. You can do some really good strategy like that. 
And the game was the mad run-jump-shoot fest that HL and other fpses is.

Hundreds of other players?? sounds good on paper... but the 60+ that I 
saw in tribes 2 didn't excite me... more bodies running around doesn't 
make it better.

But that's just me.
