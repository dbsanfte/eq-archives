There are also a few other names for it.  It is a totallitarian view, and a
guild with this policy seems very demanding of its members.

Don't get me wrong, your guild can have whatever policies it wants, and its
members can adhere to them as much as they want, so have this policy, don't
have this policy, I don't care.  I won't be joining a guild that tries to
enforce this policy, just as I won't join a guild that insists that my loot
belongs to it to do with as the leadership sees fit (I'm not talking about
loot obtained in a guild raid, that IS different, I'm talking about loot
gained in the daily operation of my character). Nor would I join a guild
which requires that I provide my home address, telephone number, or email
address to the leadership.  And here's why:

The basic problem I would have with such policies is that they are not
enrolling the character for membership in the guild, but instead they are
enrolling the player. Outright removing any roleplaying aspect of the game.

I assume, that since your guild has all of your characters enlisted at birth
as endentured servants, then your guild is further going to twink and level
those characters so that they will be able to participate in the raids that
are the reason you're insisting that they be members of your guild.

They might enjoy themselves.

If a player has enough high level characters to have them in several guilds
and able to participate in various raids held by various guilds, don't you
think that maybe (he has way too much time on his hands) s/he can play the
game for the enjoyment of it.

If you're worried about farming of loot, and access to the uber mobs, etc...
The player you're worried about has MULTIPLE raid able characters!
The damage is done.

If s/he's participating in a guild raid for another guild, that guild is
going to have expectations about what happens after the ubermob is dead.  I
doubt very highly that your "unscrupulous" person is going to get to do much
more than get to play an exciting game twice a week, instead of once per
week.  Hell, maybe with 7 supercharacters in 7 superguilds, he'll get to
play exitingly every night... but I doubt it.

That might have something to do with what you claim is a common policy on
your server.  You don't get "cross pollenization" of players relating to
other players in different guild environments.  This, inherently, makes
relations tense.  Add to that that your policies are elitist and exclusive,
and you are creating the tension you complain and worry about.
