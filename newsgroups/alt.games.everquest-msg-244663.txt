This is one reason why I hate the EQ end game.  You see the "good"
stuff you have to been in a top notch guild....but being in a top
notch guild usually means your play time is dictated to you  5-7 days
a week.  I got to the point where I just wouldn't log on cause I knew
when I logged on to play I'd have to raid and not do what I
wanted..cause if you don't raid...then you miss out on your DKP and
thus won't get that loot you want when buy time comes.

One reason I'm done with EQ and waiting for WoW, where you won't be
dependent on 60+ other people to do high end stuff...or so I hear...I
didn't get in the beta...grrrrrrrrr
