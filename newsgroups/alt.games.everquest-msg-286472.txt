Your strategy and technique seems sound.  Just a couple pointers.
first, if you accidentally kill one(just) RC.  its ok.  the event
doesn't just explode.

The event is "won" when 12 rathe councilmen are dead.  they have a 7
minute respawn,  ie  the one who died will respawn in 7 minutes.  If
your CC(on the mezzables) is sound, just press.  You may however find
that things get tense toward the last 1 or 2.  check your DPS, and
make the call to burn or try and manage.. but accidentally killing the
first or second isn't a huge deal.

ALSO

The regular mezable ones don't drop in dps, ever.

Welcome to one of the most reviled events in EQ, and one that can make
even a seasoned team of level 75s cringe in fear.  You won't face
another more gutwrenching event till uqua.
