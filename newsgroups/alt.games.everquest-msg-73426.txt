Hehe, I didn't mean to start a controversy over my comment, I merely wanted
to save you the hassle of formatting and stuff, unless you really knew what
you want and why you want it. Most everything that will run in 98 will run
in me, if you are benchmarking for speed, you may find me a bit more
sluggish, but other than that no major differences. Certainly not enough
difference to strip a hard drive and start from scratch with installing
programs, utilities, etc unless you enjoy that sort of thing.

Others may not agree, so you will have to be the judge after reading what
others have to say also.
