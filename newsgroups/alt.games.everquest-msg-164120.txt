Again, reading shit that isn't posted.  The standard of Usenet is barely
better than Web Board scum these days.

Hmm, well I think my Shaman and Wizard got 10pts of Meditate post 50.
No other increase in *any* skill, physical or mental.

Why 63?

Why not L65

Or L60?

Or L9?

The difference between a well equipped caster and a regular caster is
*already* huge due to the difference in Flowing Though, Regen, HP, AC
and Mana.  Spells are virtually identical to the Skills a warrior or
rogue gets, yet unlike a melee casters don't get their new skills when
they level.
