I tend to think Ben's advice is more geared towards groups, where the MT's
damage is actually a significant factor.  Your advice (as well as Foxeye's)
fits a raid better, where DPS classes will use the best weapons for killing
the quickest, and the MT will try to stay alive as long as possible, with
his damage being a minor factor.
