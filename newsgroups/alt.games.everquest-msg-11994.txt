I could see the flaws and labeled it as flawed. That was a overly simplistic
example plucked from the top of my head to illustrate a concept. There is
very good reason why I am a cannonfodder phone techie and not a high profile
game designer...

I spent a while on UOemulated shards (World of Dreams and Ackadia) where
player policing principals did work though. It took a talented person to
pull it off (Dundee) but it did work nevertheless, albeit on a small scale.

It would be excruciatingly difficult to pull off on a massive scale, but
"impossible" is a very dangerous word to use in IT.
