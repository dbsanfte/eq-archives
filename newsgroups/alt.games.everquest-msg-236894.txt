"Congratulations".

I wouldn't tell them anything, but as for my own interpretation,
which I would keep to myself (since people tend to be awfully
touchy about such things), I would assess whether the pattern
of "prayer results" overall was consistent with chance results,
or whether something more personified seemed to be at work.
So far, from a lifetime of watching prayer "results", my
current conclusion is decidedly the former.

See above, although it would be rather odd of me
to pray if I weren't already convinced that someone
was there to listen.
