Last night, I tried Test for the first time ever.  Rolled a new kitty Bard, named YehYeh
after the father cat on a kid's television cartoon.  Called /Testbuff, cast Selo's RoS and
ran for Shadeweaver's.

In and around Shar Val, everything looked decidedly nicer.  I can't really quantify it,
but it looked more like a hot FPS, say, UT2003 or Q3.  Everything was so nice and smooth.
Frame rates were great, although I wasn't in a populated area so I have no *real*
reference point.

The most amazing thing...when I zoned in to Shadeweaver's, instead of the familiar dark
thicket, I saw a complete zone revamp: rolling green hills, blue sky and fluffy white
clouds.  It looked like a lot like the Star Wars planet Naboo.  The beauty was slightly
marred by an ugly, translucent white trash can floating in the sky, but otherwise,
everything was serene and blissful.

Best regards,

Tim ==
