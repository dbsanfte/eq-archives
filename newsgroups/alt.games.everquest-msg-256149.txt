You forget 2 things.

Bonus Damage: Weapons sometimes have a damage of a particular type
added to them. Such as the Black Acrilia (sp?) weapons. They have a
magic damage bonus. This damage essentially adds directly to the
weapons overall damage for the purposes of damage/delay. However some
creatures are immune to some types of damage and thus the weapon
becomes weaker against those types.

Bane Damage: Some weapons get a bonus to damage (again added to the
damage/delay ratio) against certain kinds of creatures. For example
the Hammer of Wrath has a bane damage against undead, that makes it
quite useful against those creatures.
