If they simply make the loot on a given mob appropriate for the level
players that will gain exp from that mob then they don't need the Warrens
loot rules. i.e. Dont put +10int lore items on a level 12 mob.

Nobody is going to farm, what is to them, a useless item.

Then they don't need the extra code, don't have to worrry about breaking
any quests and will still allow people who may have missed something in
their youth to be able to go back and collect it. This will also accomplish
the goal of eliminating high level players farming low level mobs. This is
win/win for everybody.

The trick would of course then be determining what level equipment a
character should have at any given level. But that's what they pay the game
designers to do.

Of course they've already decided and the issue is moot.
