I don't know why, but that last sentance brought a HUGE grin to my face.

I love foxeye because, yeah, she's one of them wimpy rangers, but I'm not
as wimpy as people expect me to be, and due to my good weapon I can do a
lot more damage than people expect a non-EQ/AM3 ranger to do, so I just
start strutting around like I'm the baddest ass thing there is.  Ok, I
know I'm not, but it's so fun to FEEL that way.  Ever since I got LR5 I've
been known to break out into "Can't touch this! ba da da dah, bah dah!
Can't touch this!"

My friend's think I'm nuts, but that's ok.

Because I feel cool.
