Although I think it's humorous I agree that you were out of line to totally
fuck up the bride & groom's day.

That's right, it wasn't a guild event that you fucked up, it was 2
particular people's...two people whom you're SUPPOSED to like (being in that
guild, 'n' all).  How could you do that to your friends?  How could you do
that to your own GUILD?  You are a traitor.

But yeah, the story was funny.
