(warning: secondhand info and hearsay)

From what I've read on various boards, testing seems to indicate a
percentage increase with 252 as the hard cap

In other words:

100 med +5% mod = 105 med
200 med +5% mod = 210 med
240 med +5% mod = 252 med
250 med +5% mod = 252 med
252 med +5% mod = 252 med

Boon for those people without capped med skills, but doesn't mean you
can heap on a backpack full of +med gear every time you sit down, and
get mana at insane speeds. Kinda sounds like something VI would want to
avoid.


Also means that +dodge will prolly be the new high fashion for endgame
tanks hehe
