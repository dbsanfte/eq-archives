 >You dont need the stone or any quest to enter dungeons.

Okay. From anecdotal information, I had figured out that
the stone wasn't needed to enter the dungeons just wanted
to verify that.

Will suggest that to them. It's strange in that one of the
people will target the Magus, hail them and the Magus will
turn towards them but say nothing. The other will target the
Magus, hail them and the Magus will respond with something
that is totally different than what he responds with when
hailed by someone who he will port. I'll ask ingame for
that person to write down what exactly he responds with but,
IIRC, he offers to sell her something or refers her to
someone else in the camp. She also says she gets a message
about needing to do more adventuring. (I would imagine it's
the same one I got when I hailed or clicked on the Raid
NPC or when I try to talk to the main NPC in a camp again.)

My own totally uninformed WAG is that at least one of them
didn't get *all* of the correct answers to the correct NPCs.
I seem to remember multiple yellow messages that I had com-
pleted another step in the process.

Thanks

Tracey
