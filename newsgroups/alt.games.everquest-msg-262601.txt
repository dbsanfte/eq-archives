Precisely. Kim Jon-Il could be delivering Osama Bin Laden a nuclear 
weapon right as I type this, but hey... there's no oil in North Korea, 
so who cares.

On the other hand, we've turned a country that had no WMDs and no 
connection to terrorism (particularly when compared to nominal US allies 
such as Saudi Arabia) into the ultimate terrorist recruitment and 
training ground. Way to go.

I think you are conflating two separate issues here, whether 
intentionally or unintentionally. If you are talking about the war on 
terror, I don't think you'll find anybody here who thinks terrorism 
should be appeased, ignored, or not fought against. On the other hand, 
we are discussing the invasion of Iraq, which does not have, and never 
has, anything to do at all with the war on terror.
