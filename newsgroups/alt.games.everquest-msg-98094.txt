hehe you aren't doing anything they aren't doing.  Blacksnow is in
business to do what you are doing, selling on line assets to gimps for
cash or trade.  They are just big on calling out lawyers  or at least
making threats to do so.  If they consider you to be a challenger in the
market they will have their attorney send you a cease and desist
request.

Note:  I am just joking, I'm sure they are busy destroying gaming as we
know it and don't have time to mess around with you.  All just a joke.

th
special PS to Ben in case he is thinking of calling me a chicken little
for my feelings on Blacksnow:
Ben you ignorant slut!
