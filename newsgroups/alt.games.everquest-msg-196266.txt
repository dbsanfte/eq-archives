Q1 - Mostly no (People have managed to kill summoned pets
so as to leave a corpse, but it can't be done often or 
regularly.

Q2 - Armor helps.  At 57 I used to duo the level 55 sun
revs in the Grey with my 'bot cleric.  My took fewer 
complete heals to finish if I gave it a complete set of
summoned plate and focus items (I'm a mage)

Q3 - The pet's skill is fixed by its level

Q4 - Buff him!  You not only have pet only buffs, but they
benefit for HP/AC buffs definitely.  OTOH - there has been
some debate on whether agi/str etc buffs do anything for him.
(of course, most folks don't think they do much for PC's, so
this isn't suprising.)  If he has proccing weapons a dex 
buff definitely *seems* to help.

Find a local mage - 39 and up they can summon a backpack
full of phantom plate, 56 and up they can summon a pet only
haste item, 61 and up they might have the spells to summon
Belt of Magi'Kot (+250ac, + a bunch of dex) and proccing
weapons (61 is Blade of Walnan, 62 Fists of Ixiblat, 63
Blade of the Kedge) or best yet a 64 mage can get a Girdle
of Magi'kot (+500hp).

If you're going to be on for a while, these are easily worth
as much to a pet class as KEI is in general to most casters.
