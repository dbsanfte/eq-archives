yeah, I remember back when Verant used to get them on time... grrr
but then again, there are what 43ish servers now.... we care about you, we
want to be able to support all of you and make it easier for you to play!!
*rolls eyes*
They should at least let us patch the damn game, we all KNOW theres going to
be some big files involved, after servers are up I bet its gonns take about
5-10 hours more before you can patch at a decent speed
