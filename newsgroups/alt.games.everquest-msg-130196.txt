I've heard you can zone under the bridge too.  I don't have any evil 
race characters so I haven't had to test it out.  That whole area near 
the zone in is dangerous for evils.  Watch out if you have to take the 
spires in NK...I've seen people getting attacked there but I can't 
assist because I don't want my factions screwed up.  Most people run 
away from fight with the guard there and come back just as the spires 
spell is cast.
