By the definition you're employing, and looking at your example
messages, we *all* qualify as trolls.

Bizbee answers a great many questions with useful information, and
makes a positive contribution to this group, despite the blindness to
that fact evidenced by some. Yes, he can be as abrasive as hell, and
yes he deliberately attacks people he perceives as stupid. So do you.
So do I. So what?

Red Celt, Al/Taco, Morse Code, P&H, and MadBomma, these are the real
trolls, as I see it. They've individually done far more to
intentionally disrupt this group than Bizbee ever has, and
collectively they've contributed far less of value. Their automatic
attacks on anyone who defends Bizbee serve only to underline their
limited faculties and one-dimensional mindset.


No one is asking you to like Bizbee. On the contrary I quite
understand why one wouldn't - I strongly disliked him for a long time
myself, and I still find his reactions rather extreme on occasion. But
in reading his posts for the past year or more I've realized that
we're in agreement on a great many things, even if our approaches
differ.

What I would ask *you* to do, because I think you'll make a valuable
contribution to this group if you can get past your problems with
Bizbee, is to read his messages - not the ones that occur in response
to personal attacks on him by the above listed posse, but the messages
he posts here apart from those. I think your opinion will change. You
still won't like him, perhaps, as he'll still be abrasive and will
still attack what he considers stupid, but I believe you'll come to
recognize and appreciate the same positive qualities that I and others
do.
