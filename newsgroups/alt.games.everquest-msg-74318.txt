Dunno, I just don't see the value in buying houses... then again, I'm
probably one of the few that acutally bought the villa in FF VII, so I may
not have room to talk.

The thing that really worries me is seeing gnomes as real estate agents.
Makes me glad horses are no drop, I really wouldn't want to see a dark elf
"Would you buy a horse from this guy?" or "At Crazy D'Vinn's, or prices are
insane!"

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.

Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
