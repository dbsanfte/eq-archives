I'm having troubles finding a good spot for my lvl 32 high elf cleric
to get in a group.  South Karana is ok at 3 am when there are 10
people in the zone (hopefully a tank is one of them).  Paw is too
deadly/hard to find a group at just the right time.  I hear Highkeep
is too crowded, with lists to get in a group.  I tried Great Divide
and partnered with a warrior and eventually started a group, which
lasted all of 40 minutes.  Tonight, my calls of LFG went unanswered.
There were 3 other clerics around my level in the zone.  

So that leaves The Overthere, which I hear is great experience.  But
I'm afraid to go over there and find 100 people all trying to compete
for a spot in a group.  I do a /who all cleric 30 40 and find at least
5 clerics in that zone.  What are my chances of getting into a group
without waiting a couple hours or until night owl hours? Basically,
about how many groups does that zone support?   I'm on the Bristlebane
server if that helps to predict my chances.

Any other suggestions for zones would be appreciated.  Even a spot to
solo to 34 would be fine.  I just might have to solo those gnolls.
