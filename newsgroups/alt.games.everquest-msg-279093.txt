And why do they turn to the gnolls? From a role-playing perspective, they seem an awful lot like native americans. Maybe 
they feel the humanoids are stealing their land. Maybe they are right.

The gnolls (like orcs) are pretty much mindlessly aggressive, but the centuars don't start off KOS to adventurers, 
indicating there might be room for negotiation.

Just because someone is your enemy today, doesn't mean they have to be always. The english were at war with almost 
everyone at one time or another, but now there's peace with all of the other nations.
