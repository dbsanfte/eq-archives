I have lots of better things to do with my time.  I also have worse things
to do with my time.

But if I have a legitimate complaint about a product, whether it be the
stale donuts I got at the donut shop today or the less than stellar CS from
Verant, why am I not allowed to express my frustration without the
accusation that I don't have anything else to do?

Maybe I don't.
