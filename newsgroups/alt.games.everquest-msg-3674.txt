I have camp the AC camp in OOT many times 4 or 5 rings worth best I have
done is 3 and a half hours got a ring. Worst 22 hours one day no ring 19
hours the next got the ring, I am a sucker for guild members and friends but
I do make them come with me on the camp to keep me company. Being a Shaman I
could care less about it, But the Exp is good and the Loot is decent. Also I
have done the aegis of life quest but that on is easy set time on the spwan
kill PH come back 3 hours later and see what pops. There are many tricks to
it watch TV, read a book, chat, due housework. Always have a timer with you
to let you know when the spawn is due to pop so you can be ready. Long spwan
times are what make most of the good No Drop Items so rare it just a matter
of how badly you want it.
