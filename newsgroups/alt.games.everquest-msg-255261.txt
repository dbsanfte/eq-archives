Info on the epic quest, step by step:
http://www.bjornstar.com/

Note that the info may be a bit out of date... I think, among other 
things, it predates the ability to go to 65.

The right click effect is fairly worthless once you get into the 60s, 
you have better hastes.
Let me see, what am I carrying @55 (consults old notes, since my account 
has been canceled more than a year)
Primary is still, amazingly enough, a stein of moggok
Secondary: Grandmaster's jeweler's eyeglass
ranged: Advanced magic manual iirc. Was my 'tip' for enchanting a 
monsterous amount of platinum... (50pp a stack was my fee.. he said he'd 
pay that per stack if I did at least 25 stacks. So I did. painful, but 
we had the mana flowing... Then afterward he took me with a group from 
his guild and got me the stuff to upgrade my basic manual to 
intermediate and advanced.)

My next plan was to finish up the last 15 points of cooking (yeah, I 
bought the tannan mastery AA) and get a grandmaster chef's spoon to 
replace my stein. Unbuffed that would put my int and cha at roughly 250 
each. Many concider my gear to be very sub par, but I'm far from wealthy 
as well.

Unfortunatly I've been gone too long to give you real good advice on 
what to go after I'm afraid.
