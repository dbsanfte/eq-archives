Bring a Bard, or a high-level enchanter/cleric.
The high-level enchanter/cleric spell "Pacification" can be
used to single pull them, as can the level 8 (!) Bard lull song
(but of course the bard has to be high level to have a good chance
of making it stick on a 57 mob).

Or just pull 2-3 and smack 'em around if you have the slowing/
healing/mezzing capabilities to handle them.


>5) 1 in 100 drops sinew

It's not real common, but I've found them more commonly
than 1 in 100...

Again, pacification/lull can work wonders here.  Usually we just
pacify our way through the mushroom maze and end up having
to fight very few of them.
