Presidents are figureheads, nothing more.  They have no power other than that which
they seize, or the power to veto, which can be overridden.

Your figurehead can be a genius, if he Appears to be a bumbling idiot who gets no
respect from any other political entities or from the populace, then he's useless,
unless of course somehow appearing to be an ass is the plan all along.

Ronald Reagan, as much as he appeared to be a somewhat dim bulb, was widely respected
and made a fine figurehead, further his delivery of his scriptwriters work was
superlative, his "EQ (emotional quotient, not dragging this back on topic)" was high
indeed.  The fact that he appeared to be a bit of a simpleton only made his
threatening posture towards the soviet union more credible.

George W Bush, on the other hand, is an international laughing stock of epic
proportions.  Even at his best, shortly after the 9/11 incedent, his delivery paled
beside that of another conservative I always found distasteful, Rudy.  I believe that
any president delivering anything resembling a strong stance would have been heralded
as a fantastic leader during those trying times, I can't think of anything special
about W, who after all spent most of the day incomunicado, while Rudy, with less at
stake and every reason to lay low, was immediately on the scene and outperforming
every standard, except perhaps the one that says you shouldn't upstage the star of
the show.

If you can demonstrate how W's appearance as an unprincipled foolish boob really
benefits the country in some positive way, I'd be interested in hearing it.

If you want to maintain, on the other hand, that he doesn't seem to be an oaf,
there's just no common ground for discussion.  That would be similar to claiming wild
Bill didn't seem to be a philandering ass, nor the smarmiest politician in the 20th
century.  I'm not arguing what the men were in reality, here, appearances are
everything when what you do has little substance beyond appearances.
