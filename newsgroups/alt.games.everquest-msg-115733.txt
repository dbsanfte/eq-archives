How's this:

- My paladin gives free rezzes and buffs
- My warrior gives free help
- My enchanter gives free buffs/breeze/clarity, including runes.

All of these things take time.  You know what?  It's called being nice.
When you say "donation" that doesn't mean "here's the price tag" -- it'
means "if you want to give me something, I appreciate it!"
