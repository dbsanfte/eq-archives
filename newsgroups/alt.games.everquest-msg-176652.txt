Has anyone tried to MultiQuest the Tear recently and been successful?

Here's the senario, a high level Enchanter in my guild is offering to turn
in the Tear to Lord Rak for me.  My faction to TrueSpirit is 'ally' and he
can buff himself up to 'kindly' using Collabaration. I'm wondering if Rak
will aggro, and if we kill him, will he drop the Scale.

If he doesn't drop the scale it's no big loss, I'll just have to go to POF
and get it myself (with a raid force).
