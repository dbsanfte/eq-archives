Hi ....

Whilst it's great to level, I hate that awful noise. I've searched for a WAV
file so that I can replace it with something a bit less annoying, but I
can't find the appropriate file. Can anyone shed any light on how I might
change the default level-up sound in EQ?

Thanks for your time ....

Stevie.
