Is there a good FAQ for Everquest out there?  I have been hearing about this
game for a while and it looks good but I have a few questions before I shell
out for the monthly fee.

What is needed as far as programs to start?  I see that there are alot of
different games?
Can I play more than one character with one account?
Are there any other games like Everquest out there?

I used to play AD&D years ago and this looks similar.  Is it?

Thanks-looking forward to joining a game soon
