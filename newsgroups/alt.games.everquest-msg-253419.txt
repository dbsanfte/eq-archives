Depends... a High Elf Paladin with a Holier than Thou attitude might be 
quite beleivable. But yeah over all I see what your saying, and it would 
be interesting if EQ doesn't assigned you a class/deity based on your 
play, instead of letting you just pick, and then locking you into it.

I know a few Clerics of Mith Marr that Mith would have dumped ages ago, 
although Innoruk or Cazic Thule might pick them up ;)
