Yep, its a buzzword chicken little's use to rile people up into a
panic when in actuality there's nothing to be afraid of.

In real life slippery slopes *do not exist*. Just because you do one
thing it doesn't automatically follow that you will do the next thing.
I've heard opposition politicians spout horseshit about slippery
slopes so often even using the word disgusts me.

The sky is falling!

Worry about those sort of things when there's actually a reason to
believe they might happen.

I've been called worse.

And you not believing it doesn't make it false, either.

The theory holds. Those deep into twinking aren't the ones
complaining. Or if any are, they better slap themselves silly for
having the self-awareness of a toaster.

They are extensions of exactly the same thing. So, yes it is.

I don't see the slippery slope that you must have mentioned when the
spellbook was first removed for 35+. I don't see the slippery slope
that must have came about when death penalties were cut in half. I
don't see the slippery slope that must have appeared when exp bonuses
were given to dungeons and taken away from hybrids....

Guess the slope isn't that slippery after all!
