It is possible to run thru Kith at night naked with no SOW or other buffs
and live.  I've done it many times.

Trick is to make a hard right coming out of the WC zone (or a hard left
coming out of HHK, or whichever coming out of Rivervale) and get up on
the wall as high as you can, and stay up there as you travel.  There are
two or three places where trees force you off the very highest level, those
are real danger spots and you need your eyes wide open, hug the trees,
but don't go around them at all until you are certain there is nothing in visual

range.

Other than those trees, your path will not take you into visual range
of any mob, stationary or wandering.

EXCEPT that mobs will certainly chase anyone they see who isn't
following that plan, and once their target has died, FD'd, or Zoned,
they are now out of position, not on regular pathing.  This means that
you need to keep your eyes open the whole trip for anything ahead of
you, especially near the three zone areas.

IVU will protect you against most of the run of the mill undead... but
there is at least one which paths up close to the wall, the Risen
Commander, who sees undead, and incedentally runs faster than SOW.

Additionally, the Dread Wolves are -not- undead, just nasty SK mobs
with a harm touch that will fell a level 20 in one shot.  IVU won't do
any good at all against them, of course.

Putting IVU on -and- following the safe path should protect you nine trips
out of ten, you won't stumble across many mobs, and you can hope with
reasonable confidence that the few mobs you do see won't be the few
that do see thru IVU.

People will tell you to go in during the day only, instead... but I've been
killed doing that, as someone occaisionally goes down and finds the
DE mobs in the corner and drags them up to the zone line while
trying to escape.  Zone in to a bunch of 50+ DE who don't like you
when you don't expect it, and you are likely looking for a res pretty
darn quick.
