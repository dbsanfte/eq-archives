HGs in Rathe?  ;)
I can't recall long pulls except on very rare occasions in xp groups
(of course, I never stayed in groups with Rangers who pulled with
Snare).

I really oughta dust Kaev off, fetch his LoY spells, and go get kicked
around some in a couple of tier 1 PoP zones, just to have done it.  But
for some reason it just doesn't hold much appeal.  I have played him
(that is, gone hunting with him) all of twice since making 55 last
November, the only time I've logged him in the last two months was to
deguild him a week or two ago (didn't seem right remaining in a guild
with an inactive character).
