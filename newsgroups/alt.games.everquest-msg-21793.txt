It's not you, I have on more occasions than I choose to count been unable to
find (or even start, for that matter) a group.
Sometimes I'm going "hell, gimme a bad group, least it's a group". But then
one time I was invited into an orc highway group, while in the group got a
tell asking to join another group, and a little while later, heard a shout
for a tank of my level.

Guess casters are starting to realize it's good to have someone in a group
that wants the mobs to hit them :)
