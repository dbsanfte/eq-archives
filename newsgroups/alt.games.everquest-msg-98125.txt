As time passes, the average level of a character increases.  Hence, there
are more chars in the 50-60 range then in the 30-40 range (perhaps even
25-45).  Considering that a lot of high level adventure requires 2-3 groups,
you are seeing 12-40 chars in the same zone for 1 objective.  When you get 3
guilds in the same zone, it gets REAL crowded (120+ in ToV for 2 straight
nights on Terris).  As the number of  high level chars increase, the number
of zones needed to provide for them all increases as well, and since the
Number of high is increasing faster the that of the mid-range, the number of
high end zones must also increase faster to keep up.

With Kunark, it was an even distribution.  Velious was more to the 40+.
Then they added Warrens and Stonebrunt (mid range).  Luclin is pretty even.
Its time for another High End addition, hence the Planes of Power.
