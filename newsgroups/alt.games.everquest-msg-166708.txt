It is condescending and snobbish. 

And even you managed to grasp that, didn't you?

> The inclusion of a

So would misspellings, changing complete
sentences, and replacing random words.

>It goes back to something earlier in the thread - you said smileys are
>unnecessary in the face of superior writing.

I don't think I said that at all, though you might
want to consider that the written word has
survived for thousands of years without any need
for them.

I suggest that you not give emoticons up, at your
present stage of development. 

Those almost featureless caricatures, and parodies
of inane facial expressions, are ideally suited to
your style.

> I would now counter that
>with: some people's writing obviously isn't as superior as they think.

A glance at a few of your posts would convince
even the most hardened sceptic of that particular
fact.

>The alternative is you really mean to be as pompous as you sound.... 

Maybe if someone were to read it aloud to you, it
might help.
