I was reading a discussion forum for where to go in your low 40s. One
guy suggested that at lvl 40 you can group with a lvl 60 who is in a
zone killing things that are green to him (and blue to you)  and you
mop up all the otherwise wasted mana. I assume the lvl 60 would be
killing for faction or plat.

Firstly , is this feasible?


And, for those on Veeshan server, which zones is this practise
commonly used in?

My lvl 39 shammy would love a piece of this action.
