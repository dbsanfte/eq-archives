I thought Tiamat had about 7 heads, one for each evil dragon type.
Red, Green, Black, Blue, White....well maybe 5 hehe i can't remember
the rest :).  My favorite moment was when I proved the old experienced
player Vs. experienced character theory to a friend of mine. We had
argued this point for quite some time, me saying that an experienced
character is pretty much useless against a lower level with a more
experienced player, so we decided to have an arena based duel to
settle the thing.  Each character had 30 days game time to prepare for
the battle.  His character was in the mid 40's or 50's of levels,
where as mine was multi class with the highest level of 21 in
Magic-User.  I gave him first attack which I had thwarted before the
match with a wish spell, and proceeded to do double his hps of damage
in my first round of attacks.  The great part of it was that my
character wasn't even in the arena with him, he was shape changed into
a flea and riding on the head of a spectator in the arena seats.  My
attack was simple, earlier I had my character go to the ocean and find
a blue whale that he polymorphed into a flea,  when my foe entered the
arena my character used the psionic skill of telekinesis to carry the
flea to his head, once there my mage, or his temporally displaced
double I should say, simply dispelled magic and *CRUSH*.  Even though
his character was over double my combined levels in experience, the
character's player had no clue how to think his way through a
situation, or prepare for what he fully expected to be a long and very
difficult fight.  Ahh, those were the days before 2nd edition and 3rd
edition, good old original AD&D.  A basement full of friends, loads of
smokes, a cold coke, and all the rules whoring you could imagine,
hehe.
