You will need to cancel the previous account if you want to make a new one
and that takes some time as you are paying for it in advance per month,
quarter, or year depending what you selected. Remember that your old account
is still being charged to your creditcard if you are not playing, and there
is no need to cancel an active account if you want to play again. Your old
account might still be active for a year if you payed for that long in
advance. Just log on using your old account, delete your leftover chars if
you don't want to use them, and start playing again.
