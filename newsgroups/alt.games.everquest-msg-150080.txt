Well I think I know what I'm doing and I know eq pretty well.  And I
have tried a lot of the suggested areas for post 50 druids.  The best
solo experience so far, with least risk and downtime, is quadding in
CS.  This is true from about 49 all the way through to 60.

I'm not at all sure what the "gimp druid" reference is.  I know people
have called my mage "gimp" for fighting in Velks.  Couldnt figure that
one out either.

I spent the last few days trying a lot of different areas, because I
was getting really bored with othmirs, because half were lite blue at
59, and because the major problem there is contested spawns which I
hate.  I wasted a huge amount of "exp time" with aborted quads in ME
and Grey (both add city), with multiple zoneouts from charm gone wrong
in SG, with long long long boring root/rots in UP.  With LFG in ME and
Velks and CT.  With overpulled and trained FG.  Think I'm missing some
places, but I believe I hit almost all the "where to hunt" areas.  Oh
yes, Chardok, the new darling "in spot"...   70 people in zone.

It was pure relief to find the good old CS beach fully spawned this
morning.  And I made 2 gold into 59 while getting some work done on
the other computer.

BTW, non druid/wizzies are understandably bitter about quadding.  But
these classes were designed for exactly this, and I believe the mobs
themselves were designed for it as well.  If you feel quadders are
stealing your rightful spawns, how about that necro over there, who is
able to pull the entire zone non-stop before the next pop??

Heh, I have a nectro too.  And she is VERY fun to play.
