I'm sorry, but whoever it was, he's wrong.  I'm a level 45 druid,
anon.  I tried "/w all druid 45".  Got 2 druids, neither of them me.
Tried it again with "/w all druid 45 count".....still 2 druids -- only
difference is the names aren't listed.  Took anon off.  Now "/w all
druid 45" gives 3 druids (one of them me, of course), as does "/w all
druid 45 count".

I VERY much doubt that, even with people logging on and off, I'm the
only anon level 45 druid on Tunare :)
