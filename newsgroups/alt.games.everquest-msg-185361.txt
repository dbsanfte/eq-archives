Im surprised that noone say they use the memory blur line. Saves me getting
whacked when mez is broken, and it doesnt screw up agro like root (or
break). An absolute must in pop when you usually hit the mezzed mobs with
tash and slow before they are woken. Boggle can also be used for this, but
since it only decreases you own agro, the mob often goes for the cleric.
Recurring amnesia is best for mezzed mobs.
