Just something to keep in mind, do not retaliate, <especially> if you have
reported them. Murphies law says the one time the GM decides not to ignore
the issue but actually turns up in person (but invisible) to observe what is
happening, the only thing he will see is you mez training him.

Never ever risk even a 0.01% chance of giving a wanker the satisifaction of
you copping the warning they deserved.
