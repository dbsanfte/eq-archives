1) I haven't seen any indication that the ratio of staff to EQ has
significantly increased vs the subscriber base.
2) Again we're looking at the bandwidth ratio to subscriber base. I don't
beleive for a minute that EQ uses much more bandwidth now per subscriber
than it used to. It would have to be 50-100% more bandwidth to explain a 30%
cost increase in the face of decreasing per-MB costs.

I could swallow a 10% price increase to cover inflation ... barely ... but
30%??? For two years EQ was immensely successful and profitable by all
reports... at $9.95... and then suddenly they tell us that they need 30%
more money to 'cover costs'....  yeah... sure. They wanted some cash. Plain
and simple.

I'm not saying its still not a good value at 13.00 bucks... just that I
don't beleive for a second that it was anything more than a cash grab.
