Those things you mention are huge communication problems which later
come back to SEVERELY bite you on the ass. Want help from someone?
Problem: they can't see your /ooc or even /shout. Want a group?
Problem: you are anon so no one can tell what class you are, AND you
can't shout or ooc that you are looking for a group.

"Anyone in the Halas region in the 5th level

See? the fact that you have to even ask to be looked up here because
of course its nearly impossible to communicate in game should show you
that something is wrong. Limiting what people can do is never really
an improvement, changing the way you do things might be but not just
removing the ability.
