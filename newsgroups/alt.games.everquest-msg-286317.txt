	Consumer Reports magazine recently rated computers and their
support.

	If you really want a new machine you might look at Polywell
and Cyberpower.  Both are "off brands" that have developed a good 
reputation.  I hesitate to recommend Gateway although they get good reports.
All the ones I've dealt with had less-than-ordinary generic components
and their techncial support sucks worse than camping Gorangas for lucid
shards.  Dell's OK, still oriented more towards (large) business IMHO but
you can't really go wrong with them.

	HP's also good.  Alienware is too high end for you I think.  I run
EQ on a P4-2.4 with a Nvidia 6600 based card so I'd bet any new system
will work fine for it.
