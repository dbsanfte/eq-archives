Sounds likely to me.  Both of the baby Enchanters I've played had a
far more "exciting" time on their way into the teens than my Druid
did.  Each of the few deaths my Druid has suffered can be directly
attributed to taking large risks just for the heck of it.  There
just isn't any reason to get killed playing a Druid solo.  I haven't
found the patience to play an Enchanter beyond 17 tho, I find it
very difficult to respond to bonehead behavior by groupmates with
the sort of gentle/positive/educational approach that seems to work
best, and when I do manage to do that and the offender responds,
erm, inappropriately shall we say, my reaction is to quickly gate
home and log before I forget that EQ isn't usenet.  I have a lot of
respect for old-school Enchanters who had to endure so much before
most of the player population understood how to work with them, it
must've been incredibly trying.
