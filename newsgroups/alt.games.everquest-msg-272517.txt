It's a "fluff" spell you get on reaching level 20, all classes get some form
of it (I got a nifty hunting hawk which looks nice, but may help me out when
I run for cover apparently...) - the cleric spell makes (as in no control)
other people bow before you, but I think it can only be cast upon people
lower than your level (I think this may have been posted earlier by Annie or
Foxeye?).

I have seen a mage one where a person can turn into a frog, and a
swashbuckler one where I keep on fanning myself as the I think the caster is
wonderful....lol
