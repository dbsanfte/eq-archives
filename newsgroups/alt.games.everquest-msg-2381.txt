Morning Dew can be foraged by anyone with a foraging skill of 100 or greater
(master title occurs at 101, but you can forage the special items starting
at 100). It is found in Greater and Lesser Faydark.  It is also a ground
spawn in Greater Faydark.

Also, Oak Bark can be foraged at skill 100 and greater in Kithicor and
Warslicks Woods.

Oak Bark, Misty Acorns, Permafrost Crystals, Evergreen Leaves, Sarcoscypha
Fungus, Russet Oxide, Iron Oxide, Jack O' Lantern Fungus, Charcoal - when
they are ground spawn show up as some other graphic... not a bag.  Check out
this page: http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_find_dye.htm for some
examples of what they look like.

If you find it in a bag on the ground, most likely it was something someone
foraged or found, and then dropped.

If you want comprehensive lists of foraged stuff, check out the foraging
section at EQ Traders.
