You could also try the test server, running the test server patch seems to
correct alot of problems with the game for some reason.  I got a BSOD the other
day when i clicked the okay button after patching, after rebooting, the patch
server didn't seem to want to connect.  I ran the test patch, clicked cancel to
skip actually logging on to the test server and then ran EQ as normal and
everything worked fine again.
