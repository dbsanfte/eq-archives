I've done the hero brew up to 200, it's being stingy about giving me any 
more skill ups, I have so much alcohol I always force it on my guildies 
every time I see them.  One good thing is I can make qeynos afternoon 
teas pretty consistantly.  I'll never complain about the cost of them again.

Just to clarify, the fletcher and the brewer are 2 different characters 
so I can (theoretically) GM both at the same time.
