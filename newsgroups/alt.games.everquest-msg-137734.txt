While Atone is helpful in long term crowd control in open areas, the
Atone part isn't really needed if you intend to kill the mob.  Atone
isn't mez, all it does is clear the mob's hate list, so that if you have
it positioned far enough off that it doesn't aggro back onto anyone,
it will eventually wander off.

If you root a mob and noone is in melee range and it isn't a caster
(or one of the rare archery mobs) then it just stands there
glaring at whoever is highest on the hate list.

Root parking is an area the cleric probably covers better than
any other class (or at least more often), you get mob to aggro
on you (probably by healing the puller, who hasn't hit the add,
so his position on the hate list isn't high) and then back off,
root the mob, and leave it.  You have the AC and HP to
suck up the damage for long enough to get this to work, the
worst part for you is channeling, the lower your level the
worse your channeling skill is, which means the harder it
is to get off a spell while the mob is whacking on you.

Another cleric mez plan is Stun; you have a series of
stuns, each of which if not resisted buys you 6 seconds
of inactivity from the target.  Once you have 3 stuns (29
I think) you can time this out to "stun lock" a mob in
perpetual inactivity.  Unfortunately this requires that
you do nothing else, so its not a very good CC solution..
oh, and its single target.  While you do get some AOE
stuns, they aren't enough to pull off chain stunning as
a form of crowd control, mobs would be active for
at least 6 seconds every 18.

Another plan is Fear.  This one is incredibly dangerous
in a dungeon or area with lots of social mobs.  On
the other hand, it can be remarkably effective outdoors
with mobs that don't talk to each other much.  Fear an
unsnared mob and it will run off pretty fast.... hopefully
it will run out past its follow distance before fear breaks,
and it won't be able to find the party again.  Then
again, perhaps you use a smaller fear and rely on it to
come back after you have killed the first mob!

The Lull line should be sort of a form of crowd
control, in that like Harmony, it can be used to
make mobs not come along in the first place.
Sadly, it is VERY often resisted, and unlike
Harmony, a resist will inevitably aggro the target.
This means that unless there is a mob you badly
need to single pull, and are happy to zone out
and try again and again till you get a success,
this line is worthless.
