Bizarre.  I don't see how this could have caused a problem
with rezzes, since as I understand it when you die "X" points
of experience are removed from your character and "stored"
on your corpse.

Then when you get an "N" percent rez, it simply hands you back
N percent of X.

Regardless of how much exp it chose to remove from you when
you died at any point, that wouldn't allow you to ever
regain more exp than you lost, and there would be no possible
exploits.
