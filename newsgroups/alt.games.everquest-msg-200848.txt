While I agree with you on this point, I did come close to quitting EQ not 
long ago because the friend that got me hooked had to give it up for a 
while (long story - won't go into it).  While he was gone, I didn't 
really want to play that much.  He got back into it, and, well, I'm still 
playing.

And this is the big point.  I was stuck on having to have my rogue.  I 
had to level fast.  Why?  Because another friend (not the one that got me 
hooked, but the one that was helping me get going good) started dictating 
to me where I needed to hunt, what to hunt, blah blah blah.  Kinda got me 
bummed.

Then, when I got to leveling with Miznit the Wizard, who I started as a 
diversion, and the friend that had to start over, all of a sudden I 
started having fun again!  I was looking forward to leveling, but even 
dying and going backwards didn't bother me more than a few seconds.  A 
few nights ago I realized something....The biggest problem I had playing 
my rogue was just that...I had chosen the rogue because I had felt 
coerced into it.  I had wanted to play a wizard from the start, but felt 
I couldn't 'cause I'd make the guy mad.

Childish, I know, but that's what it was.  I used to monitor my xp quite 
closely...knew about how many mobs to ding as I closed in on the next 
level.

With the wizard, I have actually NOT EVEN NOTICED that I had dinged..not 
once, but two different nights of fighting (over several hours each).  
The first I had been wanting to get 1.5 levels, and got almost 4...only 
noticed tha last ding.  The second event, I was wanting to get the next 
level for my next circle of spells.  When I saw the ding, I noticed that 
I had gotten TWO levels.  

My problem with my rogue was he bored me...wasn't for me.  Changed to 
what I had wanted to play, and  BAM!  Problem solved.



All that to say "Yeah. /Agree"
