Just 2 1 handed weapons. If you want to see it working give him some
different types and watch his type of hits. I seem to remember that the
class has to be ALL or NONE or include Warrior, or something like that, but
I've yet to give him something that it didn't work with. Quite good fun to
give him cheap procing stuff. Gnoll hide lariats, velious weapons, snare
dagger (can't remember the name), mage summoned.

Actually, that makes me think of something else - get a 62 + level mage to
summon you some stuff to give to dogdog. There's a haste mask (mask of Mardu
or something) that give a fair amount of (item) haste that apparently
stacks, a 500 hp belt, procing swords. Suddenly dogdog is not only
outdamaging you, he's a monster!
