...one that I didn't think of was the Swiftblade of Zek.  Very good
ratio for a non-level-restricted weapon and good stats as well.

Once again the Wurmslayer is a good all-around ranger weapon unless
you have lots of money to spend.  He didn't really specify so I don't

SBoZ, on MT, is cheaper these days, for maybe 30k?  Dont remember.
