I'd have to also disagree here.  The vast majority of the times that I get
dispelled I'm the only one getting dispelled by some cleric/wizard trash mob
casting annul magic (several variations, dispelling 1, 2, or 4 buffs).  The
AE mobs are just the ones where I can get info from a large segment of
people all at once.
