There is no item in the game that is needed for you to have fun.

Sure with an epic item you may be a little better off but its not
like its the be all end all.  Most epic pieces can easily be done
on one long weekend day anyway.  The camps that people sit
at for hours on end are usually just for some rare spawn looking
for his rare drop.  Sure they are nice items but for people that
don't have the kind of time or patience to do things like that there
are plenty of more common items that can do the trick.

Eyepatch of Plunder is a good example.  A friend of mine camped
for 2 weeks to get this thing.  Thats crazy.  In 2 weeks I think I went from
level 43 to 53.  Guess what level he still is.  If you want to take that much
time away from having fun for just one item that may give you a little boost
then thats fine.  But dont bitch because you want that item without putting
in the time.

I have a wife and kids too, what do I do?  I dont camp.  I play and have
fun. Grouping with guild mates and getting new songs are much more important
to me than items.  Plus as a bard give me a drum and I can run around naked
and do just as well as I could in full Planar armor and my epic SS.  Sure it might
take me 30 seconds longer to chant something dead with a walrus skin drum but
I can get that walrus skin drum in about 30 minutes.  The epic sword would
take probably a month to get with some serious assistance.
