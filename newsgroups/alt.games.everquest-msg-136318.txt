Walden Galleria in New York (Amherst) recently came up with a rule
that says no one under 17 is permitted in the mall without a parent.
This is an affluent white (predominantly) area in New York. They did
this because of "gang" activity and activities by gangs of young
shoplifters, and other trouble makers is on the rise at the mall.  
But just wait till the newspapers in the area label it racist.
We had the same trouble in Toronto in a major mall until they
literally installed a police station IN the mall!
