so when the game was designed, green bkgd's meant unlimited targets...it was
only after the game was out and this aoe deally was abused that green bkgds
for damage spells was reduced to 4 targets? (so vi just didn't put in
another aoe spell bkgd for 4-target spells?)

i meant the previous one (sorry, all the names are the same, and calling
them by their names only confuses me more)

apparantly so (and yes, the . .. i think it's "lave storm" ..spell was rain,
and horrid)

no no, that's not what i found...i found that against red mobs (Guardian of
Fellia, mature wurm, big giant red wyverns....) my archery dps was unchanged

sure, my dps is stinky...however, against the reds, i hit as often and for
as much damage as when fighting blues

i realized though, when i logged back in, that the arrows i was using while
partnered with the mage were arrows of marr ... 3 damage...as opposed to my
normal 1 or 2 damage arrows....i didn't notice myself hitting for more, but
is it possible that i should have hit for less (like i would have expected,
based on normal melee or magic against higher cons), but that the less
damage was augmented by the better arrows, putting my archery dps back where
it belongs?

the damage of the arrow would not affect the accuracy of archery during the
fight

(ot: is it possible i should become conventional and use proper sentences,
and have a sig, and all that? =P)

or, is archery dependant totally upon the character's gear + exp ( aa, i'm
looking in your direction), and totally unsubjective in relation to the
target?
