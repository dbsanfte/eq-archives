Max range is because of his ae DD+slow, plus good old fashioned agro control
(it hits either if you get too close, or if he turns.. major pain)

Heh yeah, snare, dd, slow.. always good fun.
Ultimately though, hes just a boosted version of the TZ we all know and love
from the RZtW script. So you should have a working strat, and melee who
realise why turning him is a bad idea(tm)..

VZ though, well we personally didn't struggle on him (on something like our
first week in PoTime we had both zeks dead) but 2 guilds here, a guild on
prexus, and countless more that I've read were stuck on VZ for 1-2 months.
It certainly has a lot more thought and strat behind it than "max range,
manage agro" like TZ, CT etc

Actually RZ does have a mana drain =) But its the same wimpy version from
RZtW (and it was wimpy even back then).. so its pretty much a moot point.
Agreed hes harder than Saryn/TT, but I don't think hes ahead of CT/Bert like
the zeks are ahead of Sar/TT.
I can think of 3 guilds who killed CT, Bert and RZ on the first night/try..
but nobody who ever did Inni so fast

I think inny is a much tougher encounter than RZ.. but I guess if either 1
goes south, RZ certainly goes downhill a lot faster.  its very rare we wipe
to RZ (or go past the 2nd MA) but when we do, people die hella fast. Inny is
a little bit slower to obliterate our raid, but everything about the fight
makes it feel much more of a challenge than RZ (well as much of a challenge
as a mob can be after months killing him)
