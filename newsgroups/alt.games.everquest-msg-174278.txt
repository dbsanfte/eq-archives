That's not true I'm afraid.  I haven't actually done exe yet, mind you, 
but I've used cast sight on people going in there, and successfully cast 
cast sight on the prisoner and the executioner, so they can be targeted 
for that, at least.  Prisoner is actually a pretty good angle to watch 
from after you switch to one of the remote camera angles.

Cast sight is a weirdass spell though...
