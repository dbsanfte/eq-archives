I agree, mastering a craft in EQ requires far too _little_ time.  I
think that aspiring smiths should spend a few game-years working the
bellows for a master smith, so that then he would begin to teach them.
With luck those with good aptitude might manage basic mastery (skill
101) on their L1 crafters (no time to adventure, too busy working)
around the time their buddies hit L60 for the third time.  Remember
we're not talking wrought iron railings here, but a combination of
the knowledge to construct many hundreds of highly refined instruments
of war along with the skill to consistently succeed at crafting them.

I'm wondering just what the complainers think master crafters are doing
80 hours a week for years on end in order to become master crafters...
sipping champagne on the veranda?  (well, ok, but brewing is way easy
to master in-game, and almost as cheap as baking).
