If you want to play with real money play poker, or magic the gathering. 
Different games have different rules. There is room for everything, but 
if you want to play a different game, create a new game don't rewrite an 
existing classic while people are playing it.

They want to experiment with in game item sales? Fine, they can do it in 
EQ 2.

Player economy built around in game assets and a medium of exchange, 
mechanims and rules to specifically support player transactions... 
Sounds exactly like monopoly to me. What was the difference again?

And paying real-estate agents to buy and sell monopoloy property for 
you? Is that the next logical step after that? Maybe they can roll the 
dice for you too so you don't even have to show up.
