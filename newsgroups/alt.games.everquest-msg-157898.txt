I was thinking of that myself. From SK, you can try the run to Feerrott,
Misty Thicket, or Qeynos portals. Or run to Nexus spires and wait up to
15 minutes for those to fire. It's pretty much a wash no matter how you
slice it.

And you just know that there are going to be folks whining for a port to
Surefall Glade because PoKing to Qeynos and running across a *whole* newbie
zone just takes too damn long...
