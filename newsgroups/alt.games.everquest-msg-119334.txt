    GM, not the head GM though.

    Aye, I just mention it as a way of saying "I've seen them break rules
before".

    You'd need a high tolerance for crap. I know if I was about to be
fingered for something like that I'd make the player's life hell - stall out
their petitions, a few inopportune worldkicks, some white lies about what
one or two days the head GM would be on....

    I agree, and after reading a later post where he said they pulled her
out of the tree to see what they had left to clear it's the scenario I
believe happened. But I wouldn't just ignore the "spiteful GM" theory out of
hand before knowing what else had happened up there. I've seen the GMs break
more than a few rules in my time - they aren't opposed to doing it. (I just
don't have the screenshots like I do for the duel.)

    She first died back in Velious. With the advances in gear and abilities
in Luclin (and just from gearing up with top-end Velious drops), she's
pretty easy now. Have main tanks plink her with arrows for a good long time
before engaging so when she knockbacks them she summons them right back
during the fight because of how high on the hate list they are. She won't
summon during the arrow step because warriors with bows won't beat her
regen. I forget how many warriors we have tanking her at once, at least two.
Kill her - warriors on one side, all damage dealers on the other side. She's
only tough when you haven't taken the steps required to focus her aggro
correctly through the knockback. I've heard of some guilds having unshrunk
ogres stand behind the main tank so he can't be knocked back, but that's not
an option for us - we have no ogres. They all E-Bay'ed. ;-)
