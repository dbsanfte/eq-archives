I think I'm in  love ;) You're reminding me of my yoof in highpass
when EVERYONE thought the brass halberd was an awesome weapon. Now
nobody wants to know abou tit, its really nice to see someone
actually going up that hard first slog and enjoying it.

If you want to obtain weapons yourself you might want to consider
trying for a blackened alloy bastard sword from runnyeye when you
get a few levels. Otherwise look to buy a runic carver or axe of
the iron back - the axe should be *cheap* (50-80pp or so), the
carver not more than 200pp.
