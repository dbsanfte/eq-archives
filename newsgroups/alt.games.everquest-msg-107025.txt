    I assume it is leather, but what does the tunic off of Rumblecrush look
like? It seemed to have excellent stats for a druid, assuming you could beat
off all the drooling monks that would also want it.

    I have one on my back. It's great to be able to just jump into water and
not worry - I'd always forget to swap my Fishbone Earring back when I was
using that. The resists are very nice, too. My shield is an OotIV right now,
but hopefully soon that'll change to the Rumblecrush shield (which you might
look at too, it's quite nice) or the NToV cleric-specific random rare
shield. I could really use the resists there, and cringe when I swap in the
SBS.

    My neck is an NoS, and I use so much of what that gives me (WIS, STA,
AGI, HPs, MANA, resists) that I can't see many other dissimilar necks
improving on it. The AGI is really a pressing concern - with 77 AGI after
the Lodizal, I don't have room to play around and stay out of the penalty
zone. The NToV shield has 7 AGI on it - it would help a lot.
