I have a hunch that you're camping the entrance to the gnoll caves.  There
are more gnolls that will stay mostly blue to you through level 57 deeper in
the cave.  Follow the entrance corridor to the first chamber and take a
right.  At the next chamber, take a right.  That will lead down a long
corridor with a big rock in it.  As you approach the rock, you will fall
through a trapdoor of sorts into an area with a number of gnolls that spawn
in fixed locations.  These will mostly spawn as warriors who will be dark
blue through 57.  The necromancers (forget their name) and shamans (Oracles)
will be light blue.  Your best bet is to make the run with your Druid using
Improved Superior Camoflauge and Lev first to make sure of the route, then
have him come back and invis the monk.  Be careful of "See Invis" gnolls
getting to the trapdoor area.  The XP is wretched, but it is steady and
safe.  Hopefully someone has a little better idea, maybe a place like Droga
or Nurga.
