Ive seen their levels listed as 16-20. I know at 23 they start turning
green. I expect even the toughest are green at 26. What a useless druid.
I rather like the arena camp, bing a 2 spawn where you can pull singly. 1k
is a nice little camp, but its too far away from any trees to use treeform,
so theres a little more downtime there. You cant cast harmony on the aviaks
from the ground, but if you use levitate and run across to the tower from
the tall cliff, you can land on the tower and cast harmony that way. This
also works for "cove" near jonah.

I suppose when hes 27 or 28 he'll be high enough level for loio, and he can
solo there till level 34 lol.
