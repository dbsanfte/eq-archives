	We got this a looooong time ago, during the Dark Age right after Kunark.

	Rangers were complete punching bags at the time -- Defense capped at 200
(NO increase past 50), same as priest classes, no agro management, very
limited AC upgrades past planar (Tolan's was about it).  For whatever reason,
Verant's designers tried every single thing they could think of to deal with
the huge outcry EXCEPT the one thing that was actually needed: raising Ranger
AC.

	One of the first things they tried was giving Rangers double damage with
Archery against non-rooted stationary targets, so they could (in theory) back
out of fights and still deal damage.  In practice it doesn't work because of
the numerous bugs in the Archery code.

	Then we got increased Parry and Dodge caps, which were meaningless since
those skills don't actually do anything for players.  (They activate less than
five percent of the time.)  Then we got Jolt...at level 55, which a) was at
least five levels later than the majority of Rangers started having problems,
b) was too high a level for Rangers to learn how to use without getting their
Clerics and Enchanters killed, c) originally cost too much mana and took too
much time to cast (on the order of 3 seconds), and d) to this day has resist
problems -- then-spell-guru Geoff Zatkin reportedly said the spell was
supposed to have lifetap resists, but that never came to pass.

	Velious gave Rangers more armor upgrades, Jolt moved to 51, a fire-based
Cinder Jolt at 55 and Trueshot (which has been tweaked several times); shortly
before (or was it shortly after?) Luclin came out, they finally caved and gave
Rangers what we'd asked for for 2.5 years: 20 points of Defense after level
50.
