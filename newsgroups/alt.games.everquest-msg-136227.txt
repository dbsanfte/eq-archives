For the record. I bought mine in Europe, so it's likely a euro edition.
EQ and Kunark, come on a single cd, in a hardcase, with the serial of the
hardcase on a white label
Velious and Luclin come on a whole bunch or separate cd's each in their own
soft plastic cover. One of them has a lable marked Velious with the serial
and one has a luclin lable.

The codes you seek should be clearly visible on white stickers on one of the
cd's from each set. If their not, you might want to check the booklets, it's
been knows to end up there. If you can't find them, go to your store and ask
them to find them for you, comparing your copy with a copy (sealed) they
have. If they are unwilling you have them beat, if they do you get a new set
as you obviously do not have the keys
