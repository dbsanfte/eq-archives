I've decided it's time to get my (rather worthless) site a domain. I've been
checking around and haven't really seen a plan I like so far. I won't be
needing more than 1 or 2 gb a month, or more than 200 mb of actual space.
Cheaper, obviously, is better. Just in case, though, I'd like to be able to
upgrade easily. Any suggestions on where to go for this?
