Nope.

I've heard that most epics are now dwarfed by

Monk epic is still very useful.
Cleric epic is a must have if you are in a raiding guild
and damn nice to have even in small guilds / groups.

Ranger and beastlord epics are still decent also.

Shaman and Druid are so-so.

SK and Paladin are pretty worthless.

Mage is somewhat useful but way too much work to get it.
