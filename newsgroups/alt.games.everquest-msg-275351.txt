Throw on a damage shield, go whack on it while it's whacking on you, it'll 
take damage each time it does plus what hits you're getting in on it. Just 
make sure you have your regen on as well and you should be able to withstand 
the hits with little or not problem at all. This will also aid in getting 
your melee skills up, including the all-important defense, and if you're 
channeling is maxed out, you can still cast spells while being hit with only 
a slight chance of being interrupted.
