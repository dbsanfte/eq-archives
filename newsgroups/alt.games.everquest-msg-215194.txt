Has anyone seen a justification for EQ2 (and SWG) being released in
the US 4 months before a world wide release?

(Sensible answers only please)

Sony were perfectly happy to accept me as a Beta Tester for SWG, then
on release date, "Good news SWG goes gold, except you can't play it
for 4 months.". "Thanks for testing, but now we don't care about you"

It surely isn't for distribution reasons, as Planetside had a near
simultaneous release. As far as I know Sony are not going to have
seperate exclusive servers the way Dark Age of Camelot did.

Come on Sony, surely you can sort out a better release schedule! 

S.
