Innate regen will still be there. Theyre refunding these in case you want to
put them somewhere else. People picked AAs based on how things are now, with
mod rods and Manaburn and whatever. Now that things are being changed,
people are upset that theyre stuck with some AAs. So theyre giving them
back.
