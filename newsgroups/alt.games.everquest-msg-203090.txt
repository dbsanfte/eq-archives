It means I hereby present you with your very own Darwin Award, in hopes that
you will soon earn it.

You still don't get it.   Anyone can play this game.   Playing this game
well requires intelligence and skill.

And right there you contradict yourself.  Allow me to be very clear.  _If
you are sitting on your ass doing nothing on a regular basis, you are doing
something wrong._   You claim that you have all of the same skills that I
have, yet I'm able to find a way to play without excessive downtime, while
you are not.   Free clue, that is not an accident.
