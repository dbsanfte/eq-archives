Hi all....

Ive been out of EQ since hmm, sometime after LDON.

Im sitting here downloading the 10 hour patch, and reading the manual.

Question on servers...
Which of the servers offer PvP?  I think I noticed in another post, there 
are 4 of them.  Differences between them?  I did some pvp way back when, 
briefly.  I like the idea of Good vs Evil.

Classes...I played a Shaman in EQ to the mid 50's.  Also, played a druid as 
well as mage to the 40's.

Opinions on classes that are solo worthy?

Also, any advice for a first time EQ2 player?

Storm
