Actually, upon further consideration I'm going to revise my statement.

At the time none of them were rich.  Well, rich is defined differently
by different people but no one had made millions from EQ yet (dev's I
mean).  So they were hungry for the payout.

Fast forward a few years.  Most of the upper guys made alot of money
on the Verant sale, maybe even millions.  But the core of most of
these guys is gaming.  If they've got enough money to support their
habits I think most will then focus on making great games.

So they didn;t necessarily make a mistake from their vantage point,
but rather made a move towards something they see as a greater prize.
Namely the ability to make a game the way they want, without
"business" intereference (sales, marketing, CEO's, investors, etc).
