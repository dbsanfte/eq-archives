Assuming they made it out alive...

Presumably in such a way that they'd technically still be in the
military whilst they served any prison sentence. Quite likely
a very long sentence if they'd managed to start a war with
a previously neutral country.

Attacking a neutral party on the basis that they *might* possibly
attack you certainly qualifies as a stupid decision. (As well as
being the easiest way to draw that party into the conflict.)

The "I was just following orders" excuse just didn't cut it
at Nuremburg. Though undoubtedly it has been used since and
will be used as an excuse in the future.

At the end of the day a solider is not a machine.
