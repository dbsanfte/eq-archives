stein of moggok if you can get him into oggok
incandescent mask (might need to start a DE for this one) is easy enough to
quest with a 40s main (need a glowing mask from a skeletal monk in guk)
opal encrusted stein
green silken drape (cast mezzes, charms, roots, etc faster), costs about
50pp in bazaar on karana
could camp pyzjin for the GBS.
black alloy medallion is easy to get for someone in their 40s (mana pres 2,
5 INT, nice light source)
coterie general cape has nice INT and mana
loam encrusted cap
baskull earring
serpentine bracers are common enough to be found on vendors on karana, and
even cheaper in the bazaar, has extended affliction 2 = longer mezzes,
charms, roots, etc.

HTH,

Mystarr
