My suggestion is indeed to look at going on some open Plane of Hate
raids.  Might cost you 50pp or so or a certain number of Peridots but
it is well worth it. I have been there on 3 open raids and in that
time have won the roll for the Indo Arms and Legs, both are AC20 with
some stats.  Also won a Blue Diamond as a consolation prize for not
getting any drops on one of them which was promptly sold for 1700p=)

You already have the 2 drops from KC that you stand the best chance of
getting.  At your level Kael is also a good place to try and get some
of the Champion Armor drops from but it can be tough to get a group
together to do the arena where most of them drop.  Look to put
together a group or 2 of guildies or maybe schedule a raid for your
alliance (if your guild is allied with any other guilds) and see what
you can get=)  Some idiot (me) passed on claiming the legs on points
last time I went with my former alliance.  Sigh, misunderstood how the
rolling would be going and who could roll and lost them to a druid who
will simply make money by MQing them.  Sigh, only 34AC plus stats and
easy gems to get=(

Live and Learn,


Todd
