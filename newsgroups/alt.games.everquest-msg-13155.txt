	You seemed to be saying "since players are wrong more often
than Verant is wrong, Verant should be given the benefit of the
doubt."

	I disagree with that.  If Verant is wrong on 55 issues out of
every 100, and the players are wrong on 95 issues out of every 100,
then Verant is still wrong 55% of the time.  Therefore, the smart
money won't use Verant's opinion as a justification for their own.

	Again, that's irrelevant.  Verant has a track record of being
wrong despite having inside access to game data.  The Conquest issue
has just as good a chance of falling into that same category as
anything else.
