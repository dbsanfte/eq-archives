So many people are deathly afraid of dying that they'll happily cripple 
their output to ensure they'll have a chance at escaping death... from 
the clerics who have gate memmed to the shadowknights with multiple FDs 
and harmshield memmed.... (I mean, sure if they're doing some fancy 
trick FD pulling... but for more run of the mill combat insisting on 
tying up three spell slots with spells you'll hopefully never use is 
nuts.

I can't for the life of me figure out -why- people are so paranoid.
