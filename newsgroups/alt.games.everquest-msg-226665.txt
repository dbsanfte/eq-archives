For which class?  In my experience, the items with right-click snare are
only useable by classes that already have snare.

I have a pally alt that I have almost entirely solo'd up to 54.  I, too,
looked for something, anything, that could snare.  The one and only thing I
found was the Anklesmasher:

Of course, this isn't a right-click, this is a proc, which is quite
unreliable.  Still, it works for me mostly.  If I can't get it to proc I
resort to stunning / rooting when the mob gets low.

If you're looking for right-click snare for a class that cannot snare,
you're out of luck except for that potion.
