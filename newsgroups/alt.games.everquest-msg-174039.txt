I was wanting to go to the Bazaar to check it out and see if I can buy
a decent weapon. But i'm wondering if I can even get there ?

I always thought I had the planes of power version as that's what it
says on the patching screen. But now I notice a little "buy now" icon
next to it so I guess not. I got it off a magazine cover disk so it's
probably the first version ever released lol

Anyway I cannot access the plane of knowledge, clicking on the book on
the pedestal does nothing. Then I was reading the area that the bazaar
is in is also in another expansion, so I couldn't even run there. Can
anyone confirm this ?

I've been looking at maps and reading posts for hours, they tell me
there is a portal in the nexus to antonica, but nowhere can I find
where this portal is in antonica. Basically I want know how to do I
get from qeynos to the nexus by running.


So if I need to buy the game to get access to the POP's and bazaar and
whatever else is new, what version of the game do I need to buy ?
Seems like there's 3 different ones.
