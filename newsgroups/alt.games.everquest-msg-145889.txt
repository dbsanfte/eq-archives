Confirmed  a second drop in the pre patch time span, which would be at least
1 an hour.  Further, my saying so in /ooc got several people saying no, not
true, although when called on it they refused to give any details,
nonetheless
this suggests that at least two more have dropped post patch.  If its one per

hour, then thats theoretically one epic every 4 hours a far far cry from the
previous one epic every 5 days or so.
