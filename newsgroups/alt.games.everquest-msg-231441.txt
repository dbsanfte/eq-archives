That's nothing :), one of the companies I work with uses a centralized 
accounting system with the branch offices accessing it via terminal 
services.

At the end of each day, each branch prints out a report locally, then 
re-enters that same data into an excel spreadsheet that is formatted the 
way the accountants like it, then they print that, and fax it to head 
office, and then file it. Meanwhile a couple figures from each of the 
faxxed in reports is manually transferred to another spreadsheet, and 
ultimately back into the accounting system.

/boggle!!!

Now this is all done via terminal services... so the server that 
actually contains the data sits *not 5 feet* from the final recipients 
office. If they would just program the report(s) they ultimately wanted 
they'd save a bundle.
