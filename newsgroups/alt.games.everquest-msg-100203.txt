You have to work quite hard to get level 60 decent plate as a ranger
for your main armour set if you refuse to wear ToV cause its just goddam
ugly ;)

But its fun ;) I like being a shiny ranger and unique. Unfortunately
I'm pretty well known on our server now and my OOC's of "60 warlord
LFG" tend to get responses of "OOOH YOU FILTHY LIAR PUPPY" and "dont
listen to the rangergirl!" now ;)

Still. Its funny to know I go to these places and tank and the "ebay"
pickup groups dont notice any difference, but would *quail* if I'd said
ranger lfg ;)

Soandsos skin blisters and burns

"Hey I thought you were a warrior? Howd you cast that?"
"Luclin item proc."
"oh..."

(When I say ebay, i dont actually mean ebay, just in case chimp-with-uzi
steps in affronted ;) I mean that segment of sheep in the player population
who only follow the perceived wisdom they extract from some 5th hand
mangled quote from a FoH board 2 years ago pre-velious and scream its
gospel and if you disagree you're obviously a n00b despite all evidence
to the contrary)
