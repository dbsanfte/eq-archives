If I offer to sell you a TV, "AS IS", that I claim has had some fire 
damage, and I refuse to offer any gaurantee that it works, or can even 
be made to work, and you agree. I still can't give you a box with some 
ashes in it.

Correct.

ridiculous. Like many things: its wasn't ridiculous *until* you took it 
to an extreme.
