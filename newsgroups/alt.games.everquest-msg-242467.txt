Ooh touchy... the problem, Taras, is that your timezone is set to PST;
at least, according to your headers it is. This is making newsreaders
who use the Date header for threading purposes set your message as if
it really was sent at 9:39 am of April 2nd *PST*. Approximately 18
hours from now. :-)

I am openminded, however... it's *possible* time travel will be
invented sometime in that frame, and Taras will make use of it, and
send a message from the future for us to read... It's possible my next
hand of poker will be pocket aces, too.

...

Alas, they were not. Though two aces in the flop, so it was close....
