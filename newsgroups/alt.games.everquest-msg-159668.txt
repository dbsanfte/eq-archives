Erudite Enchanter is probably the overall best for tradeskills in general,
unless you have some specific cultural tradeskills in mind.  They have the
highest starting Int/Wis of any race, and a starting charisma of 80, pretty
easy to get it high enough for the best prices.  You will need to level the
character fairly high for some of the enchant spells though.  Farming greens
for drops is easy no matter what class, some easier than others.  Farming
blues can be tougher to do solo, I don't honestly know how an enchanter will
fair at higher levels.  In the end, you can probably max out wis or int on
just about any character with enough money and time, but you would need less
to do that with an erudite enchanter.
