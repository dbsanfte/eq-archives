I'd suggest doing this /who all thing a few times spaced out though. For
example, I run in a guild that has about 90 people (peeps, not toons) in it,
but a number of those are fairly inactive. I would say that we have 50-60
active people. It's not uncommon now to do a /who all guild and wind up with
EQ cutting the list short (too many names), but it's also not unusual to see
only 2-4 on with perhaps 2 of these being mains camped out in the bazaar. It
really just depends on what's going on in peoples lives along with other
dynamics (such as, was everyone already on earier in the day for a raid).

We did Kael last Sunday, and even though we have a number of people not at
Kael level, that night we wound up with just myself and one other guildmate
on for a while. Most days at the same time of day you would see more like a
dozen or so on.
