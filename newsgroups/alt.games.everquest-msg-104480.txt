You left out

(3) Free Agent does not have decent (any?) killfiling.

(4) Free Agent sucks at threading.  OE 6 threads remarkably well.

I use both, Free Agent at home, mostly because I don't do much newsgroup
stuff at home, and OE 6 at work.  I have never seen a quite get mangled by
OE 6, so I'm not sure what you are talking about in that regard.  There are
a number of very good free newsreaders, it has been posted about before, but
I find that OE 6, which is free and preinstalled works just fine for me.
YMMV.
