Im guessing that a Troll is a bad thing (not sure what it means),
sorry if it sounded like i came off a bit negative while posting but
hitting a brick wall like this is frustrating, and for me whoes
greatest ambition in EQ is to explore. I don't appreciate being called
an inept player, but i can understand your annoyance with me. im going
to close with a couple of questions

What is a troll (i seem to be one and while in D&D a troll has some
good atributes (regeneration, pieces of the troll that are hacked off
become another troll (assuming its not subjected to fire)?

What does CIHYS mean?

How do you map hotkeys (theres a window (at least when i play eq that
is filled with a bunch of blank squares, i've gathered that
theoretically you can map things to it but after messing with it for
30 mins i gave up (i attempted to follow the manuals instructions and
gave up, as thats 1/4th of  my allocated play time)?

Why do people seem to think (at least to me) that i want to solo (i
think group play would be fun, and think it would be interesting to
try group play i have my doubts of being able to find one)?

Why do ppl refer to killing monsters as mining?

Why are monsters refered to as mobs (if thats what ppl are talking
about)?

How do you go about finding information about quests (according to
page 88 of the  EQ tril. manual "ready-made quests. Many non-player
characters have small quests. The best way to find out what they are
is to hail various NPC's and ask. Non-player characters have certain
keywords marked in square brackets - for example "i need help with my
[problem]". if you respond with a question that includes that keyword
you'll recieve more information" I devoted a good chunk of a 2hr
session to attempting to find a npc like this in an example but didn't
is there any tips to WHERE these fabled NPC's are (it would be
interesting just to see what its like) ??

Whats the proper way to get spells into your spellbook (when i follow
the manual (to the letter) nothing happens (and yes it actually was a
spell and not that note that you start off with), therefor making
classes with a spellbook unappealing)? 

BTW to set the record straigt i play a 5th lvl Human Warrior named
Istarl (hopefully the name isn't hated by you ppl, when i initially
posted the rant i forgot to mention that, again i apologize)
