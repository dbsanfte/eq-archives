some people just need to relax a little and remeber this is just the
internet and EQ is just a game. meant for fun.
specifically im talking about people who bitch and moan about
1. Those who actually use some of there newsreaders features and may want to
post in HTML
2. Same thing as above but with Vcards
3. in eq getting upset about using Plz,u,dorf and short forms like that.
4. people begging for free stuff. if you dont like it ignore and move on.
ive seen people /shout about it at length telling beggers to shut up, go
away blah blah blah. put your time to better use go kill something.
the only things i can think of not worth ignoreing are thinks that hurt you
in some way. like getting trains put on you, someone ripping you off on a
trade or someone breaking the rules because they know they wont get caught

person who killed me while i was fighting a mob
/o haha so what if i exp killed you on team pvp a gm didnt see so they wont
do anything

Me
/o yah gms suck because most of the time dont, but you suck more as a person
for exploiting it

ok im done ranting, rough night at work.
