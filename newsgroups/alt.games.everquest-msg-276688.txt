I can't agree with you there. Everquest is pretty unusual in the low PvP
component. SWG, WOW, anarchy online, Ultima, DAoC... I think all the top
MMOGs except everquest and even then, most people have duelled in EQ and the
PvP servers were not unimportant, or why would they have had several?

In EQ1 competition for camps was pretty intense. If you couldn't progress in
PoP because an uberguild was killing a particular god over and over, you
might be pretty frustrated. If you found out the reason they could do that
was because they inherited wealth, how would you feel?

EQ2 is much less competitive but I still think a guild is going to take the
person with clearly better gear if they have to choose, and guild sizes are
small. That's competition. It should be a fair one with the person earning
their guy, not using  Daddies' American Express (TM).

Depends on the difference the designers built into the game. If the
difference is small, sure, skill would help, although EQ2 so far hasn't been
terribly complicated for the melee classes I've played. If you accept that
designers will reward you with better gear the more you pay, then it must be
very tempting to have it that someone who's paying a lot gets a lot... and
if you have the choice of a tank with 4K but skill, or 12k but he's just a
rich prat, sure, you might go for the 4K guy, but most people won't.
Besides, i recall lots of stories of tanks in EQ1 going to the loo and
leaving the toon to bash while they were afk, with no-one the wiser. How
much skill does that take?

The example given in the original article was that if you payed extra, you
would get a faster car, presumably faster than one you could gain from
skill. If this carries over, then the skilled but poor guy is going to find
they hit a wall, and the rich prat will buy their way past.

Half life has it that everyone has access to the same gear. If you can buy
powered armor, but the other guy can't earn it via skill and can't afford it
because they don't have your income, then will their trickiness with a
pistol really count?

Then it all depends on how much the difference the designers allow ... but i
wasn't using an analogy in the car racing example, that was the one the
company in the original example wanted to implement. Now, if everyone has
vw's, and you have a ferrari, maybe you will still lose the race... but the
handicap the other racers face would be terrible, and that's why in real
life, we have limits on the specs for the cars in races, so it's skill
against skill, and not wealth versus wealth.
