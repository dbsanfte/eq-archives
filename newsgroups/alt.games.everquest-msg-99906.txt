Did I spark this post from another group?  ;-)

Do what I did early on:  head to www.eqatlas.com and checkout the
hunting guide by zone.  Pick a place that you've not been yet and work
your way over and try it out.  

To be honest, I don't recall where any of my chars were at 15 (EK or
NK maybe?), but that guide should give you some ideas.

I'm sure others here will have some good level appropriate ideas.

Speaking of which, as a side note:  My 35 bard wandered into Droga
last night with some guildies.  Good lordie, I wish I would've
stumbled over that dungeon with my cleric.  Ok, except for that part
where I fell in a trap and ended up locked up in a jail cell... that
wasn't so much fun.

My cleric is a big dungeon-hound and was kind of 'lost' after Dalnir
started to green out... should've ran him over to Droga.  Oh well, the
bard had a great time.  At 35 most things on track were blue and even
cons.  Think I'll be parking the bard and waiting for some guildies to
catch up so I can take some groups in there.  Definitely a byog zone.
