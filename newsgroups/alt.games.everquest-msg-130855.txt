Yes, its why many people don't bother. To get ragefire
you must be insanely lucky (and have no one else camping there, or
jump their camp) or you must literally hang around there for up to 3
days. People might stop and get some sleep while a friend helps out,
have a friend who watches the area and will call them to wake them up,
etc. It is very lopsided risk/reward and not a very fun way to play a
game. 

However, it is also doomed. No newer mmorpgs are going to be set up
that way, not even eq2. DAOC and AO started the faster play, more
reward for time, less downtime (virtually none in AO) kind of play
that will continue in SWG and such. Patience does not = difficulty or
skill.
