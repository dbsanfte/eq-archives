Thanks to the KEI fix my Enchanter is now wanted to group with.  For the
most part, about 85% of the time, I've had to solo him up to near lvl 23,
but now people want to group with me to help their mana regen.  But whats
been appalling me is how little people know about the Enchanter.  We were in
Unrest pulling from the mansion, and got a train of 5 of various ghouls and
skeles and a mummy.  Everyone starts yelling run cept for the main tank and
myself.  There were only 4 of us and most just below lvl 20. The other 2
start heading for the zone line.  I had 3 mezzed by the time there were
about half way and the tank had one almost dead, so I didn't mez the other
so he would just pick up that fight.  We yell for them to come back and they
respond, "Are you crazy?" and zone.  They came back into the fight when we
had one monster left, and one mezzed.  The tank killed it then woke up the
other.  One of the 2 realized it was asleep and actually said, "You do
that?"  "Duh! I'm a chanter, crowd control is my job."  My main job isn't to
cast breeze or clarity on you so you can cut down your med time, thats just
a perk of the job.  Now, since the fix, I can't believe the amount of
requests I get for group.  For the most part I
think its for the mana regen spells, but some people are learning the power
of the chanter.

All I have to say to those who are whining about the loss of KEI and other
uber nerfs.... learn to play the game!  Make do with what you have and learn
to do with what you don't.  When you get a good group who knows how to
utilize all the abilities of the members, you can take down more mobs than
you can ever thought was possible, KEI or not.  When you've killed all the
mobs, you med.  Just like before.  Without KEI your more "in tune" with the
spawn rates of the mobs.  I grouped yesterday with 2 or 3 others, and we
were using my breeze.  Sure we had to med more, but when the tank went to go
pull a mob, it was there!!  We didn't have to waste extra time sitting
around because we were ready and the mob haven't spawned yet.  Without KEI,
we had a steady stream of monsters to kill, we never had to run cept once
there at the end when he pulled from upstairs and 8 came with him, and we
played better together as a group.

One last thing... wondered if anyone has heard of tradeskills?  What do you
think you can do while you med?  I've got a solo wizzie to 14 whos tailoring
is low 60s cause while I'm medding, I'm sewing.  Now this doesn't apply to
all tradeskills, but most you can carry what you need with you and while you
med.. work on them.  Learn some time management.
