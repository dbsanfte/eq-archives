    That is sort of my point...in a game with many, many zones you named
three.  There are a few more, but not enough.

I didnt say it was a big deal, but due to the lack of a multi-group
comunication system it makes it less enjoyable and more like work.  A max
group of eight would fix this as would some sorta of multi-group com
channel.

As I stated, there dont have to be Uber loot drops in zones, just a bit more
content added.

Yes, I know.  What I am trying to say, in part anyway, is that the game was
not designed for PvP combat, yet they added a guild war feature.  The game
appears to have been designed (at least at the high end) for multi-guild
coordination and yet no features were added to support this.  All the
progress in this area has been made using player made systems (kudos to
those people who have put that much work in to their guilds/alliances), I am
merely suggesting that the game be made to support this better.

Not worried about what I can -or- cannot obtain, nor what I can or cannot
see/do in the current zones.  I am satisfied with my characters.  I like
being a ghetto cleric.  Yes, I enjoy getting improved equipment but my
motivation for playing the game isnt the never ending search for new [uber]
gear.  I am also not a role player.  There is a BIG difference, in my
opinion, between a good cleric (any class inserted here) and one who is
equipped well.  Unfortunately, there are far too many of the latter.
