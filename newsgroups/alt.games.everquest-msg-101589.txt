The scalp quest in high hold is the best way as a quest. The inert
potion quest that the others mention in erudin, seems to be an
incredibly low plus to freeport miliita faction. It might only be plus
one to all those factions which means that after kiling Lucan for the
soulfire quest it will take you several thousand trips to fix freeport
militia. This would not even really be worth it if you trained the guy
from upstairs so he was right next to the guy you hand the note to
(this is an exploit of the quest and it might be fixed now, but verant
frowns on it in any event)

However, I have a better way. Go to qeynos hills and "camp" hadden.
While camping hadden (really its not even necessary that you camp
hadden, you can just pretend to be camping him to kill two birds with
one stone) kill rephas that enchanter guy. As a 55 rogue he should be
cake since one 668 damage nuke from my druid kills him. Everytime you
kill rephas you lose faction with knights of truth, arcane scientists
and you GAIN faction with opal darkbriar of the sewers and Freeport
miliita. Killing rephas is how my woodelf druid got from apprehensive
to amiable with the militia while knights of truth did not change
since it was already high and arcane scientists just got to dubious.

Arcane scientists is the int casters guild in west freeport and is
easily avoided. It is also one guy way past the jails in high hold
keep in a room by a couple other npcs (For the deepwater paladin
scimitar quest from erudin)

Since killing him lowers north freeport guards, which you already
lowered by killing one some, I'd first kill orcs or whatever to get
them up again. Or alternate doing both of these. In case you Don't
Know, the 3 new orc camps in Nektulous raise the SAME factions as the
often newb crowded ones in the commons. My dark elf has been doing
these 3 orc camps in nek since they put them in and no one else ever
comes along to kill them. It would be killing rephas to raise militia
but it can't really at 39.

He is probably about the best militia raising kill because I think he
spawns maybe every 12 minutes, you can be "camping" hadden at the same
time or just chatting with the person camping hadden while you tell
them you are camping rephas (which always puzzles them) and he is high
enough level that it seems to be a good plus. As I said, my wood elf
druid went from just apprehensive to amiable witht he militia by
killing rephas while it took her from warmly with arcane scientists to
dubious (after a big bunch o' kills)

Another big hint:

Get a wolf form sometimes while doing these things and con the guards.
At one point it brought my dark elf from threaten to dubious, so she
got a ton of orc belts, paid a druid 60 plat to do it once she was in
west freeport and gave them to the capt on the balcony of the militia.
The second trip of doing this she was no longer KOS but dubious, with
about 12 belts each time (FYI: Unfortunately those new orc camps in
nek woods don't drop the deathfist belts, rather just things for dark
elf newb armor =/ )
