Geonids in CC.

After some amusing hijinks with Tea, Lenny, and my friend Rzantha, we 
settled in and farmed geonids for a while and came out with about 60pp 
each in loot.   Then everyone had to log but Tea and I, she was up in 
the city making imbued emeralds and chatting while I tore down geo's 
solo for a few hours.  She logged, I kept at it a while longer till I 
filled all my bags.  Then I handed the camp off to a polite fellow mage 
who'd asked if she could join me, she came in with a full group so no 
idea what kind of cash she made....

I made over 1000pp.

Logged in again this morning, put in a moderately long stretch, running 
to the vendors and bank (its sure nice having both in your zone, killing 
rygorr builds CC Coldain faction now so even without sneak I can buy and 
more importantly sell) a couple times... and came out with another 2000pp.

I also hit 47 and a ways in... and that even though for a good chunk of 
it I was feeding half (40% due to the group effect?) the exp to Teapray, 
and even though I died several times with Tea rez and a couple more with 
no rez at all.

As I was logging out, a red to me chanter came up asking about a few 
silks.  I didn't have any on me, and the people hanging out in the 
entrance of the Geo cave pulling spiders (who'd been quite friendly with 
me) weren't interested in giving her any, but I determined that they 
were only pulling from in as far as the bridge.  So I ate a waterstone, 
swam the corridor, cleared a velium crawler, popped out under the bridge 
and pulled the queen out of her room along with a crawler.  Turns out to 
be closer than I'd ever like to see, I ran completely OOM, the crawler 
died, then the queen killed my pet and came straight for me... and ran 
right over me and kept going down the hall, too low hp to face someone 
my level with no damage at all.  I sat there until I could make another 
pet, then headed up the hallway, unfortunately I did have to take a 
couple of the halfling pair's spider spawn out as they aggroed on me but 
most I avoided tangling with by distance and level and moving fast. 
Caught up with the queen almost at tunnel's end, killed her and got a 
crystalline robe plus... the three silks the chanter needed!

Earlier Aru had logged in an alt she was deleting and shoved 3kpp on me 
saying she's never going to play on FV again... so I'm up to 6Kpp so 
far, and pretty much can get the rest in a few days assuming Geonids is 
ever open again... or maybe I can find someone selling a drum on discount.

Splendid One, 47 Gnomage, Firiona Vie
