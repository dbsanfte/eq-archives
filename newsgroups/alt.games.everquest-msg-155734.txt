Then forget about tailoring or smithing for a start. Actually, forget
about any tradeskills hehe. I know it's not 'cheap', but I'd say it's
certainly faster/easier for a L50+ character to earn 2k, than to earn 5
aa points.

That's the way to do it. 
Cod oil you can either fish for the raw materials for a couple of hours
in Cob Scar, or buy in bazaar (25-50pp each on Zeb)
Velium 20-30pp each, 6 pieces + 2 coldain tempers (26pp) = 2 bits
Wyvern Skins are 17pp from vendors, or 10-20pp from bazaar.

Get all the componants and any higher level tailor will be more than
happy to combine a stack or two and pass on the result. Even at 180ish
skill, I would usually end up 1 hat from a stack of combines.

All I was saying was that it's probably quicker/easier to boost wis with
a few items, than to pour 5 aa points into enhanced stats, if you're on
a budget.
