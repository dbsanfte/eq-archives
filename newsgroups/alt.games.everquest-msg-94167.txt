Much of EQ seems to be taken from or inspired by Daggerfall.   The way
quests are done, NPC-player interaction, factions, skill points, banks, and
even some of the sound effects, are very similar.

Daggerfall was a monumental ground-breaking game for its day.  Land size was
boasted to be approximately the same as Medieval England.  The game begins
with one massive, central quest that is supposed to be your character's main
focus.  But you can blow that main quest off and do whatever you like
without any real harm to your game.

The game itself is one of the buggiest pieces of software I've ever played,
yet was still functional (unlike Red Baron II, which I would classify as
somewhat playable, but not functional.)  The last patch was issued eons ago.
Very old game.  NPC graphics are 2D-ish.

The series of games is called the Elder Scrolls.  First one was Arena, next
was Daggerfall, followed by Red Guard, and I think one other I can't
remember.  But none of them were as grand or free-flowing as Daggerfall.
There's supposed to be a sequel coming out soon... I think it's called
Morrowind (sp?).  That one might be worth watching for.
