Actually, most of the NPCs in EQ are quite obnoxious if you aren't on at
least indifferent faction, and many won't talk nice unless you have
favorable faction.  So you could take your cue from the environment and
make a hotkey:  "I'm sorry, the Council of Mithril Dreams has no reason
to dislike you, but you have yet to prove your trustworthiness to us".
Or if you think that'd be bad press for you guild substitute the name
of the cleric guild in Felwithe for your player guild (can't recall it
off-hand).

BTW, if a certain druid happens upon you in SRo and proceeds to sprinkle
(he'd _like_ to "shower", but at L15 "sprinkle" is about his limit) the
Rainkeeper's blessings upon you and Lenny (as he did in Steamfont) don't
mistake him for a stalker, just think of it as a bit of a.g.e karma.
