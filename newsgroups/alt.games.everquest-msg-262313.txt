  As reported last time, all the elements of Adastraea's epic were in place.
Tuesday I was able to arrange the meeting with Kam, and the epic was
completed.
Hurrah!
  And the positive karma week hadn't started yet...
  Thursday, late night, I remind the guild that I would like to do Faydedar
that
weekend to get Rabotev his epic. Guild leader, a ranger, says "Why don't we
see if
he's up now?" There are only four of us on line at this time: me, him, an SK
afk
in the bazaar, and someone who can two-box a cleric and chanter. But the
guild leader
says this is enoguh for us: we pride ourselves in being an elite, we do more
with less.
  We meet in the Nexus, port to South Ro, start heading north. Oh my, what
do I see
...an Ancient Cyclops. And a sand giant! 25pp and part of the jboots quest
done.
This bodes well.
  In the Oasis, Fayd isn't up. We go to the gnome, TL to TD, succor, SoE,
and make
the loooong run to the lagoon. Fayd isn't up, but I have the froglok essence
on me...
so he gets spawned. Not a dragon per see, it seems, more of a walking fish.
Only
dark blue con, too. Cleric tanks, heals herself, chanter debuffs, nukes, and
chain runes
the cleric, guild leader stands off to one side plunking away with his bow.
I'm not sure
what I should do; at first I think I should be healer for the cleric, but
when it turns out
she can heal herself, I try dotting. I waste some mana figuring out I have
to be in
melee range for things to land. In the end, the same old story: our mana
outlasted the
mob's hit points. Some running around, and it's epic number two for me!
  Guild MOTD is updated: Grats Rabotev on epic! We port to PoK, and I show
off
for everyone, /ooc <link>Nature Walker's Scimitar another epic druid is
forged!
MOTD is then updated again to add that. Then updated again: "another epic
druid is
foraged." Somehow that seems better.

  Rab also managed to get a hedge run done, but no AA without a PoJ trial.
Several
guilds are running through these to get the monk epic 2.0, so I just have to
make myself available.  Last night, I had a chance at another AD raid, but I
passed, suspecting
another failure. Wise choice: they wiped with AD at 6%. In the meantime,
Adas had
been in a Dranik's Scar expedition with the guild, and earned 3 AA's and
would go
on to make most of the way to level 66. Plus a really uber drop: a shield,
not
yet listed in the magelo database, with mana regen +3 - my first mana regen
drop
and now easily the most uber thing I have, including my epic!

  Plans now focus on building up Adas' mana pool. Her epic capped her int,
so I have
been spending AA's on Innate Enlightenment to raise her cap; more GoD and
OoW
drops will bump up mana pool as well, and with some choice LDoNs I can get
equipment with slot 3 augs to take a bunch of mana regen augs I can now
afford.
With Pot9 Adas can already quad treants in PoN; my hope is she will not need
9,
which is hard to come by, and so will open up a large class of dark blue
mobs she
can now just barely solo, or not if she's unlucky. Then AA's will fly by.

----------------------------------------

  Idle thought: if SoE wants to make zones popular, they should do more than
just
make them xp hotspots. They should make them pp hotspots: mobs will drop
hill giant levels of plat. Perhaps it would be best if this effect, like the
xp boost, could
be limited to characters in a limited range of levels. That might get people
to returning
to their lower level alts to farm cash. What do you think?
