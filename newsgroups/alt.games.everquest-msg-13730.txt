Hehe :)

Why on earth did fashion suddenly dictate that while guys can wear
tents, a girl looks best in as small a shirt as possible? And while
girls built like elves and gnomes might be able to squeeze into those
undersized things, some of us are built like barbarians.
I did get a cool shirt from the non-'girl only' shelf there, though.
It basically says I'm the center of the universe.
