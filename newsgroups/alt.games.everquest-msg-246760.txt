The biggest issue I am aware of at 60Hz is flourescent lighting.  You 
will see a flicker then.  70/72Hz will correct that problem.  As far as 
the biology, as with most things, I am sure that it varies from person to 
person to some degree, and 60Hz probably places it where a vast majority 
to do not have an issue with flickering, but, some do.  Don't honestly 
know.
