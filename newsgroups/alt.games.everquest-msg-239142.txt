Sure you found all the entrances? You should be able to enter tier 1 planes
at level 46, no flags.
Heres where they are...
Plane of nightmare... follow the beach with water on your left till you come
to the next building. In the middle of those buildings is a small courtyard
with a wooden thing in the middle. Click on the wooden thing.
Plane of justice... Go up the hill where you zone in. Click on the scales.
Plane of disease go up the hill to where some brown stuff is pouring into a
drain. jump into that.
Plane of innovation... go firther down the beach till you get to a windmill.
Go inside, around the back and click on the cog thats not moving.
