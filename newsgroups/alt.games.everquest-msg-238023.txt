Annie's view points are biased.  She is looking at the situation from a
woman's perspective and is blaming Lonely Guy for everything it seems in her
nitpickings.  She doesn't have a clue of what happened.

Listen up Lonely Guy and for those that want to save your life from the
clutches of EQ:

The woman that Lonely Guy is talking about was probably just about bored and
lonely as Lonely Guy.  She wanted some fun and used Lonely Guy.  Only
difference is that Lonely Guy wanted more but the woman didn't.

The woman made mistakes like Lonely Guy.

Moral of the story:  Don't look for a relationship on EQ.  If you want to do
better, quit EQ.
