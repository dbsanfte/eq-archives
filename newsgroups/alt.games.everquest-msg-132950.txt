Welcome to USENET.  There's this wonderful phenomenon known as 
'thread drift'.  Just in case you were wondering, the subject of the 
discussion is Everquest.  Then we wandered to HIV muppets, because some 
troll crossposted it.  Then we wandered to two-year-olds, even though 
you've shown they're irrelevant to discussions of Sesame Street.  And now 
we're discussing kids who can tell monocots from dicots.  Do try to keep 
up.  Or are you just intimidated because you can't tell a monocot from a 
dicot?  If you are, you're in company again, I can't either.  If I need 
to, I'l just call my exgirlfriend and ask her kid.
