If I recall correctly, Rangers are very close to the Warrior for damage
output (inferior damage table, but near identical hit probability and
spells to add damage), they just don't tank nearly so well due to lower
ac and much lower hp.  Knights are supposedly balanced to have
approximately 75% of a Warrior's damage output, presumably because we
are a much better than a Ranger at tanking.  Knights can't come close to
55+ Warrior for tanking that one nasty mob who's the point of the raid
tho, not uncommon at all to see it announced in guildchat that "the raid
to kill an_epic_mob_00 is not going to happen unless a warrior shows".
And Knights are inferior to the Warrior in taking punishment due to
lower ac/hp, so Warrior is always prefered MT if available.

Knights cannot come close to an equivalently equipped Warrior in damage
output at high levels, not only are they on an inferior damage table
when they hit, but they hit less often as well.  Rangers can use their
spells to get close to the Warrior for damage output.  The one thing
all hybrids can do better than a Warrior is to acquire agro, so Knights
seem to be used often as SA and/or emergency assist for raids.
