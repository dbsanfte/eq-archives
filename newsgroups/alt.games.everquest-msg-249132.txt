Not even remotely. This is the second time you've tried to claim I've
used a fallacy and both times you've used it incorrectly. You might
want to learn how they apply to logic if you're going to continue
doing so, *especially* to me. The evidence to support causality is
very significant. You don't have to accept that that is the reason for
EQ's decline in growth, but to deny that it could be (by claiming the
evidence is fallacious) is either ignorant or dishonest.

Actually, that would be you. I have evidence in front of me - the
playerbase did not grow after a certain point and I think the ease of
the game was a factor in it. Your claim that it might have grown MORE
if the ease had come earlier has no evidence to support it whatsoever,
and in fact has evidence against it in the form of the easier mmorpgs
that came out - none of which was anywhere near as successful as EQ.

Moopy answered that pretty much as well as anyone could have. Once
again, you like many of your ilk confuse "downtime" with "doing
anything but grinding".

EQ had hit a wall well before the new engine. Its subscription rate
has in fact been stagnant for three years now and has been declining
since before GoD was released, according to the best estimates
available.

Again, Moopy answered this perfectly.

You haven't yet shown any ability to understand the difference between
an rpg and an action game, and all your arguments lead towards EQ as
an action game. Until you do, you're going to keep stumbling, and
making absurd statements like the above.
