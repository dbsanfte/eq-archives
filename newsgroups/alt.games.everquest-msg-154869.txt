1. Learn to post
2. What the hell are you saying here?
3. I have a monk, and fully agree with this. I also have a cleric, and I
should
    not be healing the monk (5 levels lower) as much less as I am the
warrior
    on the same mobs. Something was out of whack, they're fixing it.
They're
    changing my cleric, too. Smaller heal should cast faster or use less
mana,
    right? But no. So just suck it up and move on. If you hate it so much,
quit.
