Was it just Antonius Bayle which was having problems yesterday and
this morning.  From about 20:00 GMT until about 05:00 GMT this morning
the server seemed to be wobbly and all sorts of strange things were
happening.

My biggest problem now seems to be lag.  Until the PoP patches I was
running EQ on a very much more than adequate machine being connected
by a single channel ISDN and had no problems.  From last night if I
were in a fight with more than one mob or with more than three in the
group the lag would become unbearable.  It would take six seconds from
pressing my 'Back Stab' macro key before something would happen
(usually nothing as the mob would have chased my colleague off to
somewhere where I wasn't).

On one occasion I crashed out of the zone.  It was odd; one member of
the group tried to zone into a server (Crystal Caverns) which was down
and then the whole group seemed to be effected.  My effects was that
the building in which the zone crystal was just vanished before I went
to desktop.

At one interesting moment I took the telepad to go from Nexus to
Shadowhaven and then the next thing that I knew was that I was down on
the docks at Iceclad where I was bound.  I didn't die or anything just
was sent to the wrong zone which was a major inconvenience.

Above all we all noticed that the number of "<character> saved"
messages were reduced to almost zero.  Most of the time we wouldn't
see one for over half an hour;  which is most disconcerting if one has
just been to the bank or done a trade.  So, then if one went link dead
then one would be rolled back to where one was up to half an hour ago.
Again, an inconvenience if one has just spent 20 minutes on a corpse
run from the Iceclad docks only to go LD just before the guards at the
bridge to Eastern Wastes.


I know that sometimes things aren't working well for Sony/Verant but
the experience yesterday was truly dreadful.  Add to this the
complaints from people that the server sends down twice as much data
since the patch which makes for problems in large group areas and Sony
could have an interesting Customer Relations crisis if they don't pull
their socks up...

Has anyone else, on other servers, noticed poor gameplay conditions
recently?

Regards
  Malc
