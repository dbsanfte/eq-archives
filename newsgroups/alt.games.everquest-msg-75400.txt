Be nice to work there. Only job I know of where ya get paid to answer the
phone and be of know help whatsoever on anything covering any topic of
Everquest.

They should save money by havign a recorded voice that just says

"Thank you for calling Verant, please select from the following options, is
you problem concerning Everquest please press 1 now"

"Everquest help, Thank you for your subscription money as it provides us
with a lot of cheese to go with your whining"
