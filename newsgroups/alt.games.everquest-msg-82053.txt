Hmmm, well this is a "game". If people want to have fun I don't have a
problem with that. Even in Velks I have trouble keeping my mana up,
but then again I buff the crap out of everyone, something I notice
most clerics don't do. So rezzing after berserk is almost a necessity.
And I do it well, almost never lose anyone in the group. You are
right, in velks if someone dies it usually is pulling, falling, or a
little too much aggro bringing the statue up to US from the bottom,
there I agree with you, get as close as possible and cast that long
distance heal. The only time I yell at my pets is when they go off
pulling under half health, I dont care if someone sits in camp at low
health but the pullers should always be healed up first. And am I good
enough? I think so, rarely have a problem getting a group and I've
never been kicked out of a group.
