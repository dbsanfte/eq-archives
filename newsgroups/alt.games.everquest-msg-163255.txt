Giggling manically and surrounded by armed hamsters, ME <Me@not.home>
(if that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

Correct.

Correct.

Incorrect: I am not stating an opinion, I am referring directly to
established netiquette. When I said "what you say doesn't matter" it
was because he felt he had any say in what goes for established
netiquette. He does not.

If you need sources, I will provide them.

My opinion was never stated. Proper netiquette is not opinion, as much
as some people would like to pretend it is. Once it was, but it's
established now, and the mewlings of a few Outlook users incapable of
telling their incoherent mess postings from more experienced posters
doesn't change that.
