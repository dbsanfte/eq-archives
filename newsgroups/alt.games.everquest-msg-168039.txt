That it is.....I did get one drop of a Earth Elemental BTW.....thats also
where I got my Ebon Drake Backbone.....if you can kill them those earth
eles are always worth it. Bitter experience on my gnome cleric.

That corner near the mino caves is the only place they crop up in
Steamfont...they seem to be reasonably frequent spawns during the day, and
the best way I found for anything as constructive genocide in the region
just to increase the number of spawns occuring and so the chance of time
of getting a spawn you want....the probem is you have a lot of wandering
spawns but a lot of mobs on that spawn table....

You could try going to gfay and huting with a tracker there.....those are
low level to andseem to give the same drops. I think your odds are better
