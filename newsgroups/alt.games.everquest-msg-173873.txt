Just as an FYI as it's been mentioned (and a rare delurk for me *hides under
the brief spotlight of anyone reading post*), some of the landscape shots
are of the old engine, and the character shots are the old character models
(being redone of recent months). I *think* there was some concept art of the
new characters somewhere on www.dragonempires.com or www.moonshade.com.

*goes back to lurking and planning how to keep playing EQ and DE when it
comes out short of resorting to 4 hours or so sleep or creating more days
somehow out of spacetime ;)*

Safe hunting,
