Likely because it was one of the boards owned by King Hypocrite Yantis
(Jackass has been hitting up admins for every EQ EZBoard he can find,
trying to convince them to sell to him...with success in some cases,
destroying the community on the board) and he's stomping out any word
from competition with his jack boots....nevermind the fact that he
frequently spams every other EQ board he can find with ads for HIS
site...
