I would hardly call questing a win for EQ over WoW.  In WoW you can
actually go in, talk to the quest giver, and do the quest.  I suspect
that *very* few people in EQ have done any but the most newbie of
quests without getting some kind of walkthru.  I almost never did
quests in EQ.  In WoW, it's the reverse: I'm almost always doing a
quest.

I played EQ for years.  Switched to WoW when it came out, and recently
tried EQ again when the "come back to EQ" free trials came out.  My
personal opinion is that WoW graphics are *far* superior to EQ1.  I've
got a new, top of the line box and the WoW graphics look vivid... the
EQ1 graphics look grainy and misty.  In fact, I'd have to say that I
preferred the EQ1 graphics years ago.  It seems like they've tried to
add more "atmosphere" to the graphics and the result is that I feel
like I'm always moving thru a fog.
