Grouping will give better XP than soloing.  Group quests
will give better rewards then solo quests.   It's a fact of
life in both EQ & EQ2.

It's also not one you HAVE to do, either from a progression
standpoint or equipment standpoint.  Sure, you might WANT
to do it -- but it is NOT a "must do".  You don't have to do
ANYTHING on the newbie island except the quest to leave.
Quests in Qeynos or Freeport (and the newbie zones) will
give better XP and better rewards than staying on the newbie
island if you try that path...
