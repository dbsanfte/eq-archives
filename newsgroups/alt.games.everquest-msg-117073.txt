  I don't know.  I imagine most people don't want to be in a guild that
everybody thinks of as a bunch of untrustworthy assholes.  If I were in a
guild that broke an explicit agreement not to wake the Sleeper, I'd leave
it.

  I dont know what the ultra high end of the game is like, but I would
expect that if a guild totally trashed their reputations, the whole server
community would be set against them and make things more difficult on them.
If there's a community respected calendar system in place, maybe that guild
would be excluded from it.  If somebody finds out that that guild is going
to attempt to raid someplace, maybe some other 1st tier guild will mobilize
to beat them to the punch, just out of spite.

  But whatever, I just can't imagine it's a GOOD thing to have your
reputation trashed, even if you don't NEED your reputation.  I guess maybe
in the most absolute pramatic sense, it may be worth it to stop the flow of
primal weapons into the game to cut off your competition in more challenging
areas, but even if that is the case now, you never know how new content
(like the Planes of Power) may effect things.

  But my point wasn't that it isn't worth it to abide by the agreement... my
point was that the longer the agreement is in place and works, the better
off everyone else is, even if it is eventually broken.
