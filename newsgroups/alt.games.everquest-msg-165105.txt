I have a question for yall, I got and account from a friend, a low lvl pally
who stopped playing. I continued to play his account along with my 2
accounts.  The  pally is now a lvl 52 and I dont see why i need 3 accounts,
so i was gonna transfer him to one of my other 2.  Problem is, it wasnt
originally my account, and i just tranfered it onto my credit card since it
had 6 months on it when i got it.  If i try to do an account tranfer with
him, will VI give me a hard time? Have any of you tranfered characters?
Thanks for your help
Blant
