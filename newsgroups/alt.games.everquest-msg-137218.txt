A-  13, 14, 15, 16 yr olds are "children"...

B-  So you are conceding that it is IMPOSSIBLE that a man in the
homosexual lifestyle could develop sexual feelings towards a boy??

And you call ME a bigot???


>Are you saying that you think gay men are attracted to little boys?

It's possible...  There has been ample evidence that others are...
What makes gay men so special??

It's possible..

Nope..

And you didn't catch the "Big Brother Big Sister" reference in that
article??  It was the headline for pete's sake!!

Jeeezus, are you really this stupid??

Ahhhh I see... When faced with the over-whelming tide of your
inconsistencies, your lies and your BS, you fold and start screaming
and yelling...

Answer the question, BS.... 

Why do mentoring programs have the rule that males will only mentor
men and women will only mentor women..

And why don't those rules apply to those in the homosexual lifestyle??

Ahhhh  I forgot..

You are in a special lifestyle so you get SPECIAL rights...
