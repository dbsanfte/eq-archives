Hey folks,

My lvl 19 ranger just doesn't seem to want to break 20. Not a problem
because I like being a merchant alot and it makes a welcome break from
leveling, which in al honesty is rather boring.

It occured to me that in the good old days, guilds were indeed groups of
craftsmen and merchants. Though in EQ guilds don't tend to have this as
their primary goal.

I would like to be in such a guild though. I've been asking around on my
server Karana, but so far no luck.

Has anyone ever heard of a guild that consists primarily  of merchants? A
guild with no other goal but to supply Norrath with anything and everything?

Would make great role playing
