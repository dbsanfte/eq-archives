You will not evade me, Clif <casmity@alt.net>:

Obviously, 2hb and not 2hs :)

>I'd like to know what the average level for these skills would be at

The only thing that isn't 'average' is your 1hb skill. The great
advantage of 1hb is that it's significantly easier to get a blunt
weapon with stats than it is to get a scimitar with stats.

At 40, many druids never use a weapon, going for a paw or a book
instead. If you happen across a good 1hb with +stats, you might want
to pick it up, dump skill points into 1hb and never go anywhere
without a dex buff, whacking mobs now and then for a skill raise.
Carrying around a runed falchion because of the epic means giving up
so many levels of having something stat enhancing in your main hand
it's not funny.

At 42, I have a velium scimitar, staff of observer and dark ember. I
hang on to the scimitar and staff for fashion/sentimental reasons -
the scimitar isn't exactly uber, and not only does my 1hb have as much
wis as my 2hb, but it hits 13/32 compared to 12/35. I got all my
weapon skills to 125 by occasionally whacking a mob in groups and
asking for dex buffs, then completely quit 1hs and 2hb. My 1hb is now
149, my offense is 191 (lots of it from damage shield being hit) and
defense 181. I raised all my melee skills to 125 in case I one day get
a weapon I'll use rather than my dark ember and want to be able to get
off a hit if needed, and my only real concern now is getting defense
as high as possible.
