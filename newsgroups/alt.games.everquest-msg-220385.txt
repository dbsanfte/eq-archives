Someone else noted Kurns. Sol A is also very high. CC is not bad at
all, but less than the lower-level ones.

Basically, all zones that are "dungeon" type zones and have no light
blue mobs for 60 have a high ZEM. The Planes are also all very high
(not as high as they were before the group bonus change of course),
and tiered in ZEM according to difficulty. The Luclin dungeons tend to
have around the same ZEM as the Kunark and  Velios ones, but I think
AC is kinda low (from memory, here).

Outdoor zones are mostly all low. Cities have been lowered due to
guard-camping.

Probably the best exp progression in the game now is to get yourself a
regular 6-person group and do:

1-5 Newbie areas
5-12 CB/Befallen/Kurns/NBL/PC
13-25 Najena/Sol A
26-40 CC/Dalnir (40? dunno if that's too high)
41-45 ? dunno maybe Sebilis and Gunthak?
46-50 PoJ zone-out
51-54 PoD flies/PoM zone-in/DN spiders/Droga
55-61 PoS/PoV
62-65 BoT/CoD

Add LDON to taste, mix well ;-)
