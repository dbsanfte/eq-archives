I would think the poison used in that attack was not as dangerous as one
that a military would use. There might also be other factors. But then,
my assessments are mostly coming from second hand information. I'm sure
that if I sat down with the data, I'd be horrified and surprised at the
number of people that die from lead poisoning and the lethality of lead
versus something that I would normally perceive as deadly as sarin.

There are those things that manage to defy common logic and actually fly
in the face of it. The evidence I have to back up that statement are the
words of a friend in graduate school studying chemistry and the words of
my brother's instructor. Both individuals put the time for dying at
upwards bounding a minute.

Honestly, I'd be interested in a compiled resource that has the lethality
descriptions of chemical weapons.
