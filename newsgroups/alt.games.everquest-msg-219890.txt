HEY! (sorry, caps) hey! this is a great little story here......i remember
reading it about 2 years ago (if not more)

i've found that the case of someone being "great" by worrying about every
little detail is usually a good way to tell an exceptional player from a
very good player.....but with so much of eq being based around gear, which
in turn is based around the amount of time one can sink into eq, i find that
most people in "uber guilds" are only slightly better  than the average
player (who pays attention), and the rest of their value, as toons, comes
from the sheer number of hours they spend online

but before i approached the 60+ game, i always had this
anal-maximization-of-details motto (as put forth by this story) ringing in
my head

(now i just need to follow the pack, wait for assist, turn off the brain,
and stay plugged in for several weeks to be considered "uber" =P )

so.....funny how perceptions change
