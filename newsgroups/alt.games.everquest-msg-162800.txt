All NPCs can breathe underwater, including pets.

Yes they can. In fact, there are high level summoned items that are pet
only.

Ooh, this one I'm not sure on. But I'd say it wouldnt be worth it if it was
true, especially when you get higher level. And maybe later when pets dual
wield, handing them a shield would negate that. Maybe. Usually pets do more
damage on their own, and handing them weapons only gives them a graphic and
not much else. Unless the weapon has a proc on it, then its sometimes nice
to hand your pet one.
