I lose the channels once in a while after zoning when packet loss is 
high so I'd suggest checking the connection and perhaps setting the 
number in the DataRate.txt file down a bit.  As I understand it 
allowable values are 9.0 or less, and the default is 5.0 normally.  For 
a slow connection that is being shared I tried setting it to 4.0 and it 
seemed to help.  It's supposed to set the rate at which the server sends 
data to the client, but I don't know how low you can set it or exactly 
what the setting means.  Anyone have more information?
