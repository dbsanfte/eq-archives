Dang, how many horses have been killed here now?

The inspection does allow you to see more, in some cases, than you could see
by casually observing someone.  I, personally, think it's rude to inspect
someone without asking, and so I don't.  I also don't say anything to anyone
that inspects me, and I don't get worked up over it.  I have never bothered
to turn inspect messages off because it just doesn't happen enough that I
really give a damn.  In particular, in the case of my barbarian shaman, by
inspecting me, you can see what rings I am wearing under my gauntlets, and
what earrings I have on under my helm.  In the case of casters wearing
robes, you can see what they have on under the robes, bracers, leggings,
etc.
