With Epics you have to do everything, you cant skip bits of hail, chat text.
You stasrt in Erudin library. Hail Stofo Olan on 2nd floor. Go through his

Go to Rilgor Plegnog in Ak'Anon (mines of malfunction) and /say What

Benevolence etc first. And then you have to give him a SMR.

For a walkthru try this link

And the very best of luck to you :o)
