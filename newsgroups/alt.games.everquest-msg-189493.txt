Heard in EC the other day

"Anyone casting C3? I need it to hunt"
/ all dr00d_01
dr00d_01, Druid, 10th level
I offer him Clarity (at 54 I have C2 but it won't stick on anyone that low,
not for another 35 levels) but no, he really "needs" C3 without it he is
unable to hunt, apparently.
Reminded me of the 5th level Warrior I saw begging in the Bazaar because his
equipment was crap, 4 pieces of Crafted, inc BP and Green Jade Broadsword,
he couldn't hunt anything so poorly equipped...
