I was going to ignore this thread ... I really was.  But it's now entered
the 'fun debate stage' ....

It's not my monolith.  It's yours.  I choose not to worship it, but others
may do as they seem fit.

It has nothing to do with your effort, and really it has nothing to with my
time.  It has everything to do with the fact that I have the same right to
an opinion as you do because my dollar is worth as much as yours.

That may well be the crux of the whole issue between us at this point.  You
seem to resent me because I have the same entitlement to an opinion  ... one
that carries as much weight as yours ... even though I play casually and you
play hardcore.  The reason that I have that entitlement is that I pay the
same amount in fees as you do.

And it absolutely crawls up your back that there's nothing in this world you
can do about it.

So, given that the casual gamer (power or not) is a larger percentage of the
population in Norrath than the hardcore gamer, the casual gamer's needs get
attended to.  Majority Rules ... or more appropriately, Minority Abides.

You (or I) can always choose not to abide by electing to play a different
game.  It's not a prison sentence, you know.  If you dislike it so much
because of what it has become, remove yourself from the situation.

It's supposed to be fun.  Sounds like you don't have much fun anymore.

That would be what you seem to be representing ... the hardcore gamer who
can't abide the casual gamer.  Someone who considers the casual gamer as a
bane merely by the fact that they don't spend as much time playing as the
hardcore gamer does, yet still for some odd reason expects, for their
monthly fee, to have as much fun when they play as anyone else.

Ah, but it has been dumbed down, has it not?  Please enlightened me as to
what convieniences you consider 'dumbed down', and which are not?

You didn't address the suggestion of the 'Hardcore Tier'.  Would you be
willing to pay a larger fee to eliminate the necessity of playing around
casual gamers?

As is your statement that there is some kind of battle going on between
casual gamers and hardcore gamers.

Not just mmorpgs, but all games in general.  I agree.
