A) I'm inclined to give Bob a little more credence here because I know 
him of old, and because he's stating his case with less histrionics.

B) No idea how to get to these "beta boards" of which you speak, in fact 
I suspect they might be closed to anyone not in on the beta, which would 
make pointing to them useless.  But if they aren't, I won't know anyone 
on them either, making them a relatively poor source of information.  I 
say this, not because I've looked, but because I've seen randomwebboardx 
too many times in the past to put much faith in what you find in them in 
general.

C) Thanks, though, for bottom posting, I have to give everything you say 
about 4 times as much attention as I was before, because you are clearly 
a fast learner... and you didn't even bother arguing about it as most 
top posters do at first.

D) Bob is talking about what effect Debt has in the long run, in a game 
where he's seen it at work over months of play.  While this may or may 
not correspond to the effect EQ2 debt has, its going to take more than 
looking at low end play over a week or two to find that out... or at 
least I'd think so, I'm not in the beta so I really don't know, of course.
