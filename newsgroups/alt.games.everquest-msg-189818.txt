Equipment doesn't effect the experience awarded - if I've got a character to
twink I give him boatloads of plus hp and mana gear and a damage shield and
let him go to town.  Are you saying that you didn't get a "You receive
experience" message after killing those Greenbloods or that you did get the
message but didn't notice a move on the xp bar?  If you didn't get an
"experience" message, the answer is obvious - those Greenbloods conned
green.  I don't know why they suddenly changed - maybe once you reach a
certain level EQ rounds up your level for the purposes of "conning" if you
are more than 50% of the way to the next level and you reached that 50% mark
recently.

The one thing that's certain is that you need to find a new hunting area.
There are many places to go, but a lot of people hunt the Oasis of Marr at
14.  Lavastorm Mountains and South Ro may also be good experience.  Parts of
Paludral Caverns may be doable, but that zone can be very crowded and noisy
with hissy fits in the ooc channel.
