I tend to agree... Druids are still a plague, and Verant's statistics 
seem to bear this out. Of course, they thin out somewhat at higher 
levels, but if it's anything to go by, I've seen more Druid epics than 
all other epic weapons combined (with the possible exception of 
Ragebringer, which is a very inconspicuous Epic). This could mean that 
the Druid Epic is ridiculously easy to get, but I tend to think it means 
there are still lots of Druids in the high-end game.
