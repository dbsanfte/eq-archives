I guess last time I played EQ, I just shouldn't have logged on at all that
time.  Not only had I lost 2 1/2 bubbles of EXP (over all), but I went
slightly below hitting LV23 (de-leveled).  I was on about a 5 minute corpse
run, and thought I'd just come back on the next day, during my day off.
That next night there was a power outage, preventing me from getting back
online.  The next few nights I just didn't think about it at all.  Finally
this morning I logged back on.  On the player select screen I noticed I
didn't have any armor or weapon.  I first thought it was a graphics glitch
(that happens occasionally).  While waiting for my character to load, I
remembered what had happened, that I had died & was going to come back later
for my corpse, containing a 300pp robe, a stein of moggok, and a few other
items possibly 50pp+ total.  <<By this point, most people reading probably
know the rest of this story.>>  I looked at my spells, they were memmed, so
I was re-assured I'd seen another graphics glitch when logging on.  I
checked my inventory and realized I actually hadn't came back for my corpse
yet.
    As I zoned into Puladale caverns (sp?), I hit my /corpse key...no
corpses.
    I checked my log file.
    I had died 169.5 hours ago.

Anyone know of a good place where a LV22 (almost 23) DE Necro can solo to
regain about 550-600pp loss?  I'm in EC now looking for more bone chips
(they were on the corpse too).
