I got to thinking... here it is the middle of November, my monk is two
gold into 43 and I am wondering. Would it be possible to hit 51 by
December 1st?

What kind of dedication would be needed to complete this task?
Currently I play about 6 hours an evening. Fridays, Saturdays and
Sundays I can probably play most of the time, save about 12 hours of
sleeping time.

If this is possible, could I get some info on where to go to complete
my goal. Should I be solo, duo, Full Group?
