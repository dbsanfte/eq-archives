I soloed my Beastlord a good bit of the time and possibly the reason you
observe most people grouping is because soloers tend to prefer out of the
way camps.  If you can see them then you can take their mobs, so we soloers
are a reclusive bunch most of the time.

I always prefer grouping, but there are times when I can only play for a
short time, or actually just have no idea how long I *want* to play, and the
freedom of logging out is quite convenient.  Also depends on how tolerant a
mood I am in and how willing to roll the dice on just what sort of group
I'll be getting myself into.
