I, like many, experience heavy "lag" in certain zones/areas (e.g. NFP
market). I say "lag" because I'm not convinced it is actually network
lag. What usually happens is this:

When moving through the marketplace, what appears to be MANY dropped
frames, actually seems to be related to my hard drive. Every time the
game stutters, the hard drive is going crazy. If I stop and just turn
45 degrees or so at a time, the hard drive gets hit heavily with each
turn.

System:
PIV 1.8MHz
512MB RDRAM
ABIT TH7-IIR motherboard (with 2-40MB UATA100 drives in raid-0)
LeadTek GeForce3 64MB
Cable modem

I have the system swap file on a seperate drive on it's own channel
and set to a static size of 768MB.

Surely, I have plenty of memory, video and processing power, so why is
it hitting the hard drive so heavily? Can I prevent this somehow? I am
assuming it is hitting the swap file, but, naturally, I would like it
to work more in physical memory than virtual. Any ideas how to correct
this?

Thanks in advance.
