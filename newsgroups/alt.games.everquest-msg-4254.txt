Not that I've noticed.  It just says "This is a drink" on my water flasks.

I'm wondering about the non-alcoholic player-brewed drinks, if they last
longer or have effects.

Plain rations cost me 26cp.  Iron rations cost 157cp.

I'm wondering if they last 6 times as long to make up for the sixfold cost
increase.

Even if they don't, it may be worthwhile for those that don't get back to
town often.
