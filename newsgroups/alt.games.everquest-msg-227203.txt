Its been a long time since I did this, and I can't really remember the 
reasoning or which mob it was.

The idea, though, was that we didn't have enough clerics to do a faster 
CH chain; there's only so much you can say "speed up the casting" when 
you are working with a given number of clerics.  Cast time is fixed at 
10 seconds, plus 2 seconds in between casts, so a one cleric "chain" is 
12 seconds between CHeals, a 2 cleric chain can land one every 6 seconds 
at best, a three cleric chain, one every 4 seconds, so on.  Even that's 
not practical in many cases, because chain casting CHeals as fast as you 
can tends to lead to yanking aggro off the tank, and again this was back 
in the day where you couldn't rely on every 50+ warrior having a BOC 
(and warriors were unquestioned kings of tanking in every situation, few 
thought about how much better knight aggro was and that you might want 
to deliberately use them instead)

It also wasn't that the mob was doing too much damage for a cheal chain 
(would be nonsense to say that a DL chain would heal more) but rather 
that his damage was very chunky; probably a proc of some kind, at any 
rate, two procs in a row and the MA would die, something like that.

Cheals cast in more than twice the time of DL, especially with DL being 
affected by BOF and Spell Haste items (I don't think either existed back 
then).  So if at best your Cheal chain could land one every 4 seconds, 
you could instead land a DL every 2 seconds.  If the mob was hitting 
every 3 seconds, then the 4 second chain would give him frequent 
opportunities to put two rounds between heals, while the DL chain would 
deny that.  If the DLs were sufficient to keep him alive indefinately, 
then they'd be safer under the circumstances.

I'm not saying it was a great plan, mind you, but I do recall it seeming 
to make a certain amount of sense, and I was trying to recall any 
situations where DL really did make sense to cast... it was never a 
favorite of mine.
