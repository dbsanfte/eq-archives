Because, in the real world, those squires would be being assigned
tasks, and would spend painful, long, dull, hours doing practices with
their mentors -- when they weren't polishing armour or grooming the
horse.

In a game, it's like this:

SirLevelsALot:OK, JohnsMule1234, come with me.
JohnsMule1234: /follow SirLevelsALot
JohnsMule1234: Going AFK. On autofollow.

Six hours later....

JohnsMule1234: Back. W00t! Dinged 12 times!

SirLevelsALot: Yeah, these purple-specked gnolls are green to me, I
can kill 'em all day. Thanks to Kaev's brilliant game design ideas,
your character has levelled incredibly thanks to my tutelage! Just
like me being a knight and you being a squire! Great, eh?

JohnsMule1234: Yeah. Hey...I've got like 50 new abilities here...what
do they do? How do I use them? What's this armour I'm wearing? How do
any of these spells work?

SirLevelsALot: Got me. You'd think that after being grouped with me
and gaining so many levels, you'd have a greater knowledge of your
abilities, not none at all. Go figure. Oh well, I'm logging off here.
This region is mostly going to be yellow or orange to you, but, you've
learned so much grouping with me, you'll know exactly how to win all
those tough fights by careful use of your resources and abilities.
Boy, it would just suck if you'd had to grind up those 12 levels on
your own and never learned anything from it, huh?

(SirLevelsALot logs off. The sound of rending flesh and crunching bone
begins to fill the speakers, as JohnsMule1234 flails madly with 'Call
Of Utter Power' and 'Enchantment of Blessed Strength', hoping one of
them will kill the Giant Snorklewhacker currently feasting on his
innards...)

(All of the above translated from 133t for your convenience.)
