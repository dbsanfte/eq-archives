While I feel for Pirg, he did do the quest incorrectly and admitted it
(doing the Woe/Envy and Ghiosk prtions multiple times) which is an exploit
and does break the rules.  He was attempting to max his faction which, while
it did raise faction, raised it to a level out of range for the quest.

: The epic quests do any of them warn you not to do certain parts over
again.
:

Why should they warn you against doing parts multiple times?  It makes no
sense.  The only reasons to reattempt portions of the quests would be to
redo a failed attempt or to exploit the system.  No more, no less.  Can you
think of any other reason?  Even if someone tells you to redo a segment to
increase faction, that is still an exploit.
