Thanks for the advice.  I was glad to know what help and who to ask.  A
necro from my guild summoned the corpse for me for no charge, not even for
the coffin!  As a lowbie with not much to offer my guild other than chat and
the very occasional tradeskill item (I've never even grouped with any of
them...) I was a bit afraid to ask for help, but as soon as I did, there
were 2 or 3 offers of assistance.  So for me, the lesson is it's good to
have friends, and don't be afraid to ask for help!  :)

Thanks again,
Frinka
