	The Arbiters were running in-house HoT raids several days a week.  We
could mobilize to kill most epic-drop mobs in minutes.  We could race to
contested mobs and win.  We had our own days in Hate and Fear on the server
schedule.  People cold-contacted us for membership, seeing how cohesive we
were and how effective we were at accomplishing goals.  We had real-life
meetings on both coasts, one nationwide one in Las Vegas and a second
nationwide on the drawing boards.

	Then PoP hit.  Now we have just enough people to avoid getting
auto-purged.

	How's that, dimwit?
