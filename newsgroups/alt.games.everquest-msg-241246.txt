So do you think that we can make groups larger than the 6-man groups allowed
in EQ? I certainly hope so, this has been an annoyance for many years. In EQ
we cant play together because of the stupid 6 man limit, I can't fit my 7th
friend into our group.... and in a recent interview Brad says "It's about
playing together". Which was something SOE was saying too, however SOE never
really meant it... and forced limitations on us.

But now.. a nerf.. You cannot use group leadership abilities with only 2
people in groups anymore. Hey this is nice of SOE i must say... now we have
a group that is minimum of 3 people but not more than 6. A raid is minimum 2
people and maximum 72 people. Certain zones only allow a number of groups
entering etc. All of these designer ideas are flawed. We just wanna hang
out, slap together a raid with the people who want to come and go kill
sommething. We don't want to have to downlimit or make stupid rules who can
come and who cant based on the # players allowed to enter and play. This is
group/raid limit is just an annoyance which is one of EQ's weakest points,
that i hope Vanguard will make better for the player community.
