Doesn't matter, staying with your old guild long enough to get your epic 
while applying to a new guild is just plain despicable.  I would never want 
a person who behaves in that fashion in a guild I am in.  If his old guild 
is willing to help him get his epic, after knowing he is leaving, that is 
something else, but to not tell them, and try to get their help is just 
wrong.
