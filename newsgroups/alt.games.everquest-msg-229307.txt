As much as SOE steals ideas, I would have assumed that they would have
stolen Diablo 2's "hardcore" mode by now (i.e., make a character, and
if he/she dies, that's it. They're dead, character deleted), but with
a little more leniency like the auto-return to level 1 as a permanent
server. I would certainly play there.
