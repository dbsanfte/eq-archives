Ok, first, the One Ring was a ground spawn near Gollem, second, Bilbo
got it and gave it to Frodo only after he decided to retire the character,
so clearly it -isn't- NO DROP, unless Bilbo is an NPC, in which case
he can't twink Frodo with the Mithril BP.

Completing the quest?  Gandalf gets those items -long- before the Crack
Of Doom quest is complete.  I forget the details, but Gandalf somehow
comes up with those two items after killing the Balrog, I get the impression

he disbanded, ninja looted the robe and staff, then /q out to fake LD.
