/agree

I think the folks decrying the "lists" posted here should go
read it.  You still won't like everything in it, and I do wish
they had at least acknowledged that they still need to fix the
graphics bugs etc., but it does present a much more balanced
summary.  The final paragraph is particularly telling:

    SoE divulged that these types of player summits would
    continue and would also be used for EverQuest2 and their
    other MMO games.  This first EverQuest summit was "top
    heavy" with representatives of top guilds as the current
    Gates expansion was the main bone of contention.  However,
    with their recurring mention that the majority of their
    base of active players being in the level 30 to 50 range,
    we can construe that future summits may well consist of
    more players of that level range.
