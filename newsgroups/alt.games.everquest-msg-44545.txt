I'm just getting back into EQ after a few
months off but the last few Tuesday morning
patches I've noticed many of the servers going
down hours early. I work a semi-graveyard shift
that's over at 3am EST and it used to be when
they said "down at 3am PST"(6am my time you
could set your watch by it. Not whining just
an observation.
