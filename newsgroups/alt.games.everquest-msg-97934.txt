You need to select the "Combat" bank of abilities to see the slam hotkey

Our epic is piercing, so are a lot of other good weapons, ie the REIf which
is 12/19 80 dd proc from memory. Keep 1H blunt up as well if you can, as
there are bound to be a few decent maces along you travels. 2H blunt is nice
for when the damage cap comes off and you can start hitting for 150s.
