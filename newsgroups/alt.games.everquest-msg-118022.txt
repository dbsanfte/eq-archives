Heh, someone in the auction channel thought the same thing.  I'm not looking
for full set of fine plate, but rather, what used to be the top of the line
(for what it was worth) human cultural armor (as opposed to Field Plate, or
Seafarer's Ringmail).  It's a bit better than Lambent.  The BP has an AC of
26, as opposed to the 20 of Lambent.

I know it would be best to go for singing steel, but I don't quite have
enough cash for it, and I don't want to look like a blueberry.  On top of
that, this stuff has better AC.  I'm hoping with the lowered trivials, there
are more smiths that can make it.
