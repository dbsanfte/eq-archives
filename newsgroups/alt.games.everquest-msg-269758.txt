Suppose I buy a used car at the dealer with 4 gallons of gas in it for 
$2000.00. If I want 4 more gallons of gas should I have to pay another 
1500.00?

Perhaps you think we should only get 4 bank slots, with the option of 
paying $6/mo for another 4? Or perhaps our game banks can only hold a 
maxium of 999 coins, with the option of paying another $2/mo for the 
ability to hold 9999. Or perhaps a limit of 2 people on your friends 
list, with the ability to add 5 more for $1/mo. Perhaps characters 
should only be an adventurer OR an artisan... unless you pay another 
$3/mo to make your character able to do both? Perhaps, you should only 
be able to make good OR evil characters without a nominal upcharge of 
$5/mo to double the amount of 'content' you get to see.

I bought everquest the game, and I pay a subscription to access it. 
Period. I shouldn't have to shell out an additional monthly fee for 
every feature in the game i want to use. Trying more than 4 of the 40+ 
options shouldn't require spending a boat load of cash extra. 

HD space is cheap. I don't need unlimited characters. Howabout a maximum 
of 50. Lets go nuts and say that needs 1GB of space. (Which is utterly 
ridiculous... I'd be willing to spend 50c/mo to up the number of slots 
from 4 to 50. And I'd still be paying far more than its worth.
