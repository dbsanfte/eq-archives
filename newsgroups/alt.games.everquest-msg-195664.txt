Um, no.  According to Sony there has always been a group bonus, and said 
bonus was increased as of the patch that occurred after January 14, 2001.

                             Grouping Bonus 

                             We've always been the first to say that 
EverQuest is designed to promote grouping. Those who prefer to solo should 
be able to do so with some restrictions, but probably will not be able to 
go everywhere and do everything like a well-oiled, or like multiple well-
oiled groups. This is a main foundation of EverQuest, and is what drove our 
decision to implement a class-based system where classes have strengths and 
weaknesses that complement each other. 

                             Aside from making it so that the best gear 
requires groups, either to get quest items or get the best gear directly, 
our goal was to make it so that groups could advance faster than a solo 
player. One way we tried to reach this goal was by putting experience 
bonuses in dungeons, so our changes mentioned above should certainly help 
in that area. Another way we tried to reach that goal was by giving a per-
kill experience bonus based on the size of the group. 

                             One thing that has been confirmed by many of 
our high level players, both inside and outside the company, is that the 
"best"  groups can already advance faster in a grouping situation than by 
any one member camping a single spawn. However, it has been pointed out 
that not everyone has the opportunity to get in the "best group". This led 
to many players choosing to "camp the single spawn" because they then do 
not have to worry about someone else getting their character killed. This 
in turn exacerbated the problem, as many players chose to "camp the single 
spawn" from creation to old age, and are just beginning to experience 
grouping and learn group-skills at about the time that dungeons become the 
most unforgiving. The inevitable result is that the level 50 "dungeon 
newbies" contribute to the fact that the group isn't the "best group". 

                             Our goal is to get people grouping earlier, 
and provide them enough of a bonus where they do not feel that they are 
losing ground during the learning process. We feel we can do this by 
doubling the grouping experience bonus and by scaling it up based on the 
size of the group. Currently, the bonus is an additional 2% experience per 
group member, not counting the first one, leading to a maximum bonus of 
10%. Following the next patch, the bonus will be as follows: 
  

                                       2 person group - 2% total bonus. 
                                       3 person group - 6% total bonus. 
                                       4 person group - 10% total bonus. 
                                       5 person group - 14% total bonus. 
                                       6 person group - 20% total bonus. 
  

                                  This bonus is applied to the total 
experience reward for killing a creature prior to distributing it to the 
group.
