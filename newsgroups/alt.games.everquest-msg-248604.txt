Both druid POTC/POT9 and druid Mast of the Hunter will stack, giving you
14+9+8+3 for 34 mana/tic

Set "type" to flowing thought.
Unless youre quadding id consider mana regen more important than wisdom
(mana pool)

Ring of the solstice, FT1 quested but all the bits are
buyable/tradeskillable (about 5k)
Girdle of thundrous spirits, FT2 about 50-60k
Boot of flowing slime, FT3, about 80k
Ornate leather bracelet pattern, makes FT2 bracelet. about 90k
Also you can do the quest for runed prayer shawl (FT3, Extended enchancement
5) but you will need help for some of the pieces (kael, SG)

Guess its just ring of the solstice for now. Keep farming. Or join a rading
guild and theres lots of nodrop FT stuff. HP in ssra drops a really nice FT6
shield.
