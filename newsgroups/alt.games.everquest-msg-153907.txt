Well, at least with the Cleric epic, everyone in your guild will want to
help (or they should).  The Cleric epic is increadibly useful.  Mana-free
res makes recovery after a wipe out sooooooo much faster.

Without the epic at level 56+, it is 600 mana to res someone.  Even with
optimal res order, and a couple Clerics, it takes a long time to get 20 or
30 people resed.  With an epic Cleric, it can be done in 5 minutes.  That
gives you enough time to maybe get people healed and buffed and medded in
time to handle repops and keep the raid going.
