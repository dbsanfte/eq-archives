Nope, KC is right out... I like banking at the outpost.  It's also the 
only spot on the map I can TP myself to, besides my bind point...

}you're a gnome, you're supposed to die anyway, might as well go now.

Yep, that's about what I'm thinking.  Just bring one of the guild clerics 
along for the inevitable rez...  Of course, I'm about 2 hours in Velk's 
away from 51.  I guess my real question is: would a 50/51 enc, a 52 
cleric, and a 51 war be able to have any fun there, and if not, who else 
would we absolutely need to bring?

And which fun should we hit first?

Would my 45 rogue and 45 druid friends be of any use whatsoever, or would 
they just die?

Heh, and speaking of which... What's the most effective way to power these 
kids through the rest of their hell level?  Our LGuk raid was pretty 
effective, but is there anything to top that?
