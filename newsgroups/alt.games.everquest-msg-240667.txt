Its a download only expansion.

If you *must* have a CD it is included with the Evolutions pack. (I
hear that's not readily available outside of NA though.

I'm sure if you wait a bit, they'll rebundle EQ+Kunark through GoD
just before the next expansion comes out. Maybe even in Europe ;)

As far as not buying it through the online store... I wouldn't worry
too much... you're already subscribing to the game. The CDs you have
are useless ;) as the game we're playing isn't quite the same as the
one on the discs... 

The only thing of value is the account key which once tied to your
account renders the CD worthless. If you reinstall EQ you can
redownload it via the patcher, wihtout the CD (your account will still
be keyed).
