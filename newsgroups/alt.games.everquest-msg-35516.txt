STA affects weapon speed...you start swinging slower as your yellow bar goes
down.  I've heard from many places, but never a proven or highly believable
site, that once you STA gets over 100 (or maybe as high as 110) you never
have to worry about the yellow bar again regarding attack speed.

If you hear people asking for "zing," the invigor line is what they're
talking about.
