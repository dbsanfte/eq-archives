I started with root and rot as a young shaman with mammy calves using sicken
and tainted breath and root.
But before that I used "Flash of Light" with good effect on calves. It's a
relatively quick casting first level spell that is easy to cast between
hits.  Cast it and pull back - when it sticks the mob runs around aimlessly
for about 12 seconds.  That gives you time to hit it with another dot or two
before the blindness wears off.

However, since this methods requires a lot of tanking, make sure you are
close to Bandl when you try it. :-)
