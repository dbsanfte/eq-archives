Wow your words cut real deep.

You know, you could have a perfectly valid point if you talk about my
abrasiveness, strong opinions, language, grammar etc. I mean theres a lot of
valid reasons to flame me..

But to bring my usenet "handle" and email address into the argument.. you
could just well be the biggest retard i have ever had the misfortune to
waste my time on in the newsgroup, ever.

You fucking idiot.  Come back when you have a real point to make
