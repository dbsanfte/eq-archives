LOL. I'd bet 90% of the mmorpgs out there right now started out with 
someone like yourself thinking that exact same thing. Then reality set 
in: money, timeline, publisher, deadlines, resources, technology

Hell, I was involved in a team that was doing just that 
(http://www.magicosm.net). We got pretty far along as far as getting a 
foundation done, but various things parts of the list I made above have
