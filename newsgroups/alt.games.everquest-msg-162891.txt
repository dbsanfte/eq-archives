With a shaman, either SK or Monk is probably your best bet. Shammy/monk
is a tried and proven combination.

Enchanter? That's rough for a duo. I'd say Necro, but two boxing those
classes efficiently is going to make you one VERY busy little camper.
Cleric would work for a while, but only to the mid levels IMO. Bard
would also rock, but again, you'd better have as many arms as an
octopus, and the bard really doesn't get much benefit out of the
chanter.
