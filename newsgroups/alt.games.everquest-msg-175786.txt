Washington, most likely place for the rebellion to begin and probably where
the new Federal capitol will be.
California, when this state has succeeded from the union then it will be
over, Texas will join immediately after, then Florida, then the rest of the
country.

I would think that the current president should remain the president

So either there will be a war between Washington and California or they will
be smart and band together without a shot fired and a ripple effect will
occur and instantly transform the world from a bloated and struggling
fascist empire being driven into the ground into the same world we have
always known basically U.S., England and Israel, with France, Canada and
Mexico as allies, at least then there would be some chance of success. I'm
pretty sure the army that is being sent out there now is probably just being
sent out to be slaughtered just like in Vietnam, I doubt anyone running that
army intends to win anything. It would be better to somehow transform the
leadership in our government and then just use the army that is out there
and use it to actually defeat someone we would consider to be a wrongdoer
instead of just marching them out on a desert plain to have them nuked which
would leave America broke, powerless and probably childless too.

Writing is fun, too bad it is considered to be a crime to use words
sometime.
