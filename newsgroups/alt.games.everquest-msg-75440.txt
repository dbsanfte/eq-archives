If the bread is gone, the lizard tail quest is still there. I've only
done it with my troll, so I don't know for your particular starting
faction, but if you can do it with wolf form, that will fix up your ogre
faction to get in and bind.

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=286
is the first quest. If all you want to do is bind there,  you can get in
the zone with that one. Problem is, the quest *lowers* your greenblood
faction which is the SKs there, so you wont' be able to train, etc.
However, that should be fixable by doing the second tail quest:

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=282

That will improve your greenblood faction once you have good bouncer
faction. (Crackneks). The PITA part of this is that the tails don't
stack and you'll have to slaughter a boatload of leezardmen out in
FreeRot to get them. But it could be done.
