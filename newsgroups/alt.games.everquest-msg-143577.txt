Heh, there're so many different opinions about this that I
wonder if any of us have enough info to make sense of it.

What I know for sure, is that when I tested the Cancel Magic spell
(weakest in the dispell line) (in May? can't recall for sure) I
found that it would remove a buff apparently at random, but the
"random" choice seemed to be weighted to the top of the list.
There was no correlation between age or level of buff and the
order in which the buffs were removed.  Also, contrary to what
somebody said elsewhere, you can get a failure with a self-cast
dispell, I did have it fail to remove a buff at least once.  This
leads me to my "check 'em in order until success or out of buffs"
theory.  I've not fought any dragons, so I can't really speak
directly to the "dragons kill buffs in slot order" claim advanced
by Faned and a couple of others.  I did notice when fighting
chromadracs in SF that I seemed to lose my buffs a lot faster with
a 25MR than with an 80MR, but I've never directly tested that.
