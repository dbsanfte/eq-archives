1 : a weak or imaginary opposition (as an argument or adversary) set

State mandated sterilization/abortion is NOT a direct analogy to the
spaying/neutering of pets. There is no "mandate" to spay/neuter pets,
and the act has nothing to do with judging part of the pet population
"unworthy" to breed. Bringing up state mandated abortion/sterilization
of people and tossing in the idea of "deeming" pets/people worthy of
reproducing  fits the definition of strawman. Both points are weak and
imaginary, since neither applies to the spaying/neutering of pets.

Oh yeah "Mr. Reposnsible". Your cat is a male. Unless you keep it
indoors (with no exceptions) for it's entire life (you must like the
smell when he sprays), you have no way of knowing whether or not he
has ever sired a litter of kittens. Not much of a bar to set for
yourself, when your cat isn't the one that gets pregnant.

>Though I am beginning to see your point.  Laziness.  "I can't be bothered to

You really must be trolling, because I can't imagine anyone could be
as small minded as you appear to be on this issue. Laziness has
nothing to do with the decision to spay/neuter. We have two indoor
cats (1 male, 1 female). It isn't laziness that prompted us to
spay/neuter, it's necessity.

At least we can agree on something. :-P

The statistics for starvation and death among stray cats and dogs are
alarming and easy to find if you take the time to look.  While stray
cats do not pose a direct threat to humans, stray/feral dogs are a
very serious threat. The damaging results of overpopulation have
absolutely NOTHING to do with endangering other species (though this
is a serious problem in Australia where rampant feral cat populations
are decimating and endangering native species of rodents).

Give me a break. Tens of thousands of people are bitten every year by
stray dogs. Some (usually small children) are even killed. Strays
aren't rounded up because people don't like to look at them. The
"inconvenient amount" you refer to are a serious threat and health
risk to people.

Main Entry: over�pop�u�la�tion 
Pronunciation: "O-v&r-"p�-py&-'lA-sh&n
Function: noun
Date: 1823: the condition of having a population so dense as to cause
environmental deterioration, an impaired quality of life, or a
population crash 

See above. If you don't think starvation, disease  or semi-wild packs
of dogs roaming the streets isn't "impaired qualilty of life" for the
domesticated species, then I don't know what is. Walk into any SPCA
shelter and you will see the effects of "overpopulation" all around
you.

How about staying on topic. This discussion isn't about people or
issues that generate knee-jerk reactions.

You tell me which is more "humane". Preventing the birth of unwanted
pets through spaying/neutering, or letting them breed and wind up in
shelters where they will evetually be euthanized generally after
contracting a disease from the other animals around them.
