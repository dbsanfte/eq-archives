Does anyone know if the newer Sound Blaster Audigy Sound Cards have
the same problem as the SB Live?

Thanks,

Steve Charles

P.S. Not played much since upgrading to XP as the sound was so poor,
and no music during fighting...never knew if I was fighting or
standing there looking stupid until it was too late.  Worked okay with
the stock XP SB live drivers, but they did not allow use of a 4.1
speaker setup.
