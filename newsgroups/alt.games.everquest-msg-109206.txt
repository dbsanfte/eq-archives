Aye - sorry about that - but a few life experiences have made me pretty hard
skinned and cynical. You get your "half full" people and your "half empty"
people.... then you get people like me that think the glass has been shoved
up our ass and then broken. I tend to hold a pretty low opinion of humanity
as a whole (and don't make special allowances for myself either).

I used to be a blind faithful idealist at one stage in my life too, and just
like smokers - it's always the heaviest smoker that turns into the most
rabid anti smoker the day after they quit... If I have children - I will
teach them to treasure a good life but not expect it.

I find a lot of the mentally ill people I have met to be the nicest people I
have met. I saw a "Looney" walking down the street a few years back,
shouting to himself - happy as a lark. He shouted "Hello" to everyone he
passed and waved with genuine enthusiasm, and everyonepointedly ignored him.
He didn't care, everyone was his best friend and the world was a wonderful
place to him....... Lucky bastard ; )
