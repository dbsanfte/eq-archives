Your NOT stupid!

It looks like IBM may have had some "special" Matrox cards made that
do not conform to the standard physical AGP card specs. Sadly you may
have a "proprietary" Maxtrox card.

I can't really tell from your description, but is it possible to
install the new AGP card in the case? Even if you have to modify the
case, as long as the card fits securely you may be able to use it. If
not......

Are there any PC parts shops in your area?

Here is what I am thinking.....
1. Buy an ATX Case (you can find cheap ones for @$40-60)
(Enlight 7237 is excellent)
2. Buy the cheapest ATX motherboard that supports your CPU and RDRAM
@$50-90. You want a MB based on the Intel i820 chipset, and compatible
with Slot1 PIII processors. (a quick trip to www.preicewatch.com found
Asus P3C http://www.asus.com.tw/mb/slot1/p3c-e/overview.htm)
3. Gut the IBM and put all the parts into the new ATX case (floppy,
CD, HDD, Soundcard, CPU, RAM, new video card)

This will cost you another $150, but it frees you from all the
"propreitary" crap.

Wish I could offer more help, but that's the best I can come up with.
It pains me to see a fellow EQer suffering with hardware problems.

Cheers
