Who said anything about "earning 20k a week"?  For that matter, prior
to your post here who said anything about "earning" any particular
amount per week?


> more than I am. I mostly check my mule, write down prices, then go back to


Writing down prices is too much like work :-p  I have become familiar
with the pricing of a number of items over time, some are steady, some
drift in a particular direction (down usually), some are cyclic (these
provide the best opportunity to make pp via speculation).  What I've
noticed recently is that a number of "steady" prices have been drifting
down and quite a few "cyclic" prices have been reaching new lows with
many more instances of these items up for sale than has been the norm.
Adding to the downward pressure is that buyers appear to have become
suddenly a lot more cautious, bargain hunters are plentiful and eager
twinkers are becoming rarer.

I sure don't see the word "stupid" anywhere in my post, nor anything
from which you could reasonably infer that that was my meaning.  I
simply stated my opinion as to the most likely cause of the changes
I've observed in bazaar pricing over the last few days, starting a
couple days before the patch.  I don't pay attention to Monk armor,
so I couldn't tell you whether there has been any upward trend in
those prices on my server other than the fungi tunic which seems to
have moved up some (closer to 20% than 50% tho).
