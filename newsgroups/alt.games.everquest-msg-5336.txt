I must say I agree also.. I would never go back to HHK though. there
often are not enough spawns to go around.. which is the appeal of the
Lake. I call it OASIS II (OT and DL are III and IV).

If you can put up with the trash talk its a great spot.

Another suggestion might be Unrest. An oldy but a goody. Also the
Aviaks in SK could be good as well, another "standard" transition for
lots of folks.

Field Of Bone also offers many opportunities to those brave enough to
go there at 19, just dont expect to see anything but Iksars.
