    Well, now that it's on Lucy there's no excuse not to look it up! ;-)

    Resistant Discipline: increase all resists by 16 (level 30) to 20 (level
38). Enduranceupkeep (obtained by looking at the Raw Data page): 3.
Duration: 5 minutes.

    The endurance cost is quite low. Focused Will has an upkeep of 1, and my
49 monk's endurance bar doesn't even twitch when he uses that. 20 points is
enough that people will want to use it - people used to swap in near-useless
resist gear just to get 20 points of resists. The duration is long enough
that it should last until you switch to an end-of-fight discipline. And
considering the other disciplines that share the same timer (Fearless and
Focused Will), why not use it?
