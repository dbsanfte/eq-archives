Is second figure on that meter really a measure of lag? I recall it 
being something like how much data per timeframe or something like that. 
So with a lot of people around you, you'd have more network traffic 
causing that figure to rise but as long as the leftmost figure doesnt 
rise it shouldnt matter. At least thats how I think it works :)
