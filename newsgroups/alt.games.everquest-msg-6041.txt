LOL I hate when that happens.
As a newbie I spent from lvl 5-8 hunting in Qeynos Hills.
And Wolves would aggro on me for no good reason.
I would pop them a time or 2 and usually they would die.
One day I was hunting like normal and was looting a giant rat and outta No
where I see the following

A wolf bites you for 5 points of Damage
Holly Windstalker says "Humans like you deserve to die!"
Holly Windstalker begins to cast a spell
Grasping Roots Entangle your feet
Guard Cheslin says "Die Like a Mother less Gnoll!"
Guard Cheslin hits you for 15dmg!
Holly Windstalker hits you for 30dmg!
You say "WTF?"
You have been slain by Holly Windstalker!
Loading Please wait!

That wouldn't have been so bad except from that point on everytime I would
bend over to loot a kill, a wolf would come along and start biting me in the
ass! And this pitiful seen would repeat over and over again.
I have made a vow that as soon as I am high enough I'm going to hunt down
Holly Windstalker mercilessly :-)
I've already killed Cheslin many times
Either way I don't hunt in QH anymore.
