I think the stupidest question I've ever been asked was in GFay.  I was
selling my services as a smith, and auctioning that I'm making FP armour.  I
got two questions in one day:

First nitwit asked me to trade him a FP breastplate in exchange for his
Banded breastplate.

Second nitwit insisted I should sell him a FP breastplate for 1 Plat per AC.
(FYI, FP BP has 19 AC, costs minimum 109 Plat to make.)
