Yes, thats just what I'm describing.  Instead of allowing me to
pick between test and regular EQ, and -then- downloading,
it automatically downloads the latest patches for whichever
server I used last, and then I can either play or go to advanced
options, switch server types, go back to the main patch
window, and download patches a second time.

Further, whenever you switch server types the system seems
to want to do a fresh download of the major files, despite
having done one half an hour earlier (say I am forced to
load test, then switch to regular and check a spawn with
my main, then switch back to test.. which by the way means
four download cycles, although at least the third one,
reloading regular, is brief...)
