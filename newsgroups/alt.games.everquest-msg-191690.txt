As someone else mentioned.... always follow instructions to the
letter. Know who the MA and SA on the raid is (Main assist and
Secondary assist). /assist the MA ONLY when told to do so. Thats so
very important. I dont know how many raids ive gone on where the tanks
all jump the mob at once. VERY bad. The MA will solo the mob to build
a solid aggro. Then he/she will call for melees to assist. Dont do
anything to comprimise the MA's aggro, dont taunt etc. Although if the
MA is good enough, this shouldnt be a concern. Even if you suddenly
get swamped by other bad guys, dont worry about them or attack them
even if you are getting smacked. The enchanter (or bard) will take
care of them. You have to rely on the concept that everyone is doing
thier job. If you do yours, then its easier for others to do thiers.
There are lots of other details, but this one is one of the most
important. It also depends on the encounter you are going on. Inform
the raid leader that you are new to raids, so he/she knows to inform
you of the details of the raid and what to do and what not to do.
Above all, have fun, the whole point of the game :)
