EQ2 and WoW both have a much improved questing system over EQ.  In
fact, I was sort of surprised you bring this up as a plus for WoW,
because it seems like EQ2's questing system is slightly better.  You
have the little helper window that gives you the current quest
information.  And in EQ2 it seems like you automatically get
appropriate credit for quest items as you kill a mob that carries it
is a nice touch... no arguments about who gets to loot.

Yes!  The "storyline" in EQ has always seemed pretty contrived.  Maybe
Warcraft is just as contrived, but having played War2 / War3 I really
enjoy meeting the characters and exploring the story.

I have a 3 year old machine with a video card upgrade and 1 gb of
memory, and it really struggles to run EQ2 in city zones.  WoW runs
perfectly, with almost no lag at all.  The view may not be as
gorgeous, but being able to actually move and see what's going on is a
huge win for WoW.

The questing system in EQ1 was so painful and so obscure that I think
virtually everyone used online walkthrus.  EQ2's quests may seem
tedious but compared to EQ1 they are a huge breakthru.  One of the
main improvements is that if you simply pick up quests you can advance
quess almost by accident, simply by exploring and talking to NPCs.  So
rather than focusing on one quest and getting frustrated, it can be
useful to get a bunch of quests and periodically look thru the quest
journal.
