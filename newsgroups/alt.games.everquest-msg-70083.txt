I went back and made all world zones use the old textures. The new
textures frankly DESTROYED me in old world zones though I do fine in
luclin zones (ironic, eh?) Most of the reason for this is the clipping
does not seem to do anything in old world zones. I have clipping all
the way down and still see clear across freeport or rivervale, seeing
all the new bigger memory hogging textures. Meanwhile, in luclin if I
bring the clipping all the way down in shadowhaven or shar vahl I am
in total darkness and moving very fast.. so I put it out a couple
notches where I can just see the buildings around me.

The problem is that though it acts like it can, going back to old
textures via the install did not work for me. I put in my cd and put
for it to reput in the old textures and it did. The problem is that
when I next got on everquest the patcher wanted to patch ALL of those
textures with the NEW textures from the server and gave me a "download
will be exceeded so can't patch these files" message. 

I had to go back and take my backed up velious DIR i put on 2 cds and
dump it into a new folder for eq, move over all my *.opt , *.ini and
*.txt, uninstall luclin then reinstall luclin in the new dir and this
time NOT select to update old world textures. 

Now I move MUCH better in freep and rivervale and such while they
really did not look that much better before except the ground was more
spotty and buildings more wood grainy.
