I feel your pain - Rem has grouped with many such wizards - in fact, I
think it's the reason *I* play my wizard pretty darn well (modesty -
isn't it grand?).  The only time I overnuke, is when I have to save
the parties collective ass on pull gone somewhat awry - I usually have
full to near full mana, so when I *really* have to do some heavy
bombing, I can root/nuke without fear of running out of mana.
Otherwise, I just watching the melee hack tediously away for a few
minutes, only to stand up, wiggle my fingers and *BAM* - next pull
please, and then quietly sit back down in my corner again.  I don't
think there's a more satisfying feeling in the game.  Early nukers are
really missing out.
