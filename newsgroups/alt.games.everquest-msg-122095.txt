Biz, this is a waste of time no matter who's right. I'm not continuing
to insist I'm right. I'm not going to say you're right either.
Frankly, it's not worth the effort to go digging for research behind
an article I read in a newspaper I can't recall anymore when I can't
even recall WHO did the research. This is Usenet, not a school thesis.
I have better things to do than compose a bibliography for every
little bit of information I come up with.

About CS issues. I have a friend in the guide program. I can't prove
it. Terribly sorry. But I would point out that you gave no more solid
proof on your points in that particular discussion. The best you came
up with was some snide remark about how "my guide" has different
information from "your guide"... In fact, this is the first time
you've pulled this "DT makes shit up and posts it as fact" bullshit
and actually posted links for your side. 

Allow me to point out that this that you jumped onto me about like a
horny dog on the mailman's leg is totally irrelevant to the
conversation at hand. Are you so bored you're LOOKING for excuses to
attack people?

You're acting like a troll, plain and simple. I'm not going to play
your stupid game here.
