The FM wandering giants near LoIO can be stunned, I believe.  I seem to
recall, back before snares and roots stacked, and before I had jboots, my
standard plan when Bonds of Force was resisted was to stun them to get time
to try another BoF.  (If that failed, I'd then root them and run to the
zone).
