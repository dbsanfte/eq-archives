Go to Dragon Necropolis. Without a rogue, it's "an adventure".

City of Mist for Jade reavers, required in the druid/ranger epics. It
*can* be sort of done without a rogue if you use the wizzy

one of the most desirable classes, and aside from insane damage, their
special skills are part of the reason.
