Remove. You may have to go back and reinstall the earlier ones since
the patcher would not let me do it. I went back to a virgin velious
and reinstalled luclin without the new textures.

The problem is that clipping does nothing really in freeport. Move it
in all the way and you see just as far. What that means is that you
are ALWAYS loading those horrible textures and getting horrible frame
rate. I get BETTER frame rates in luclin zones than freepor or
rivervale. After going back to old textures for the old world things
are improved.

Something else, though the options might suggest HIGH, do LOW for
textures. I have textures set to LOW, all models on, dynamic lighting
off and i do fine. I also have texturecache=true.

it does, it saves you a WHOPPING ASS load of memory and less memory
swapping. My system is a tnt 16 meg agp, p2 400 384 meg ram and win
98, vcache limited to 13 meg max to free up as much system memory for
EQ as possible (and since memory file caching won't help EQ type
programs at all but is more the realm of servers with a lot of the
same file requests) With high textures I was using 500 more meg of my
swap file .. thats bad.

Of course out of the gate im likely better off than you because I'm
using windows 98. Xp is using more system mem just being on at its
default install than 98 is (at least 30 more meg as far as I know)

Evidently NOT. The install makes you think there is but there does not
appear to be. However, you can try but it did not work for me. What I
did was go back and deselect the old world new textures, then install
the old textures. What happened was that when i ran everquest.exe the
patcher wanted to repatch ALL of those to new textures.

One thing I found out AFTER that, you can run the everquest deinstall
from control panel programs Everquest shadows of luclin and select to
REMOVE the new textures. If you do that you might be able to then
reput in the OLD ones with the install program, I'm not sure. If it
tries to patch every EQ texture file when you run everquest.exe, you
are having the same prob I was. In that case if like me, you backed up
your entire EQ/kunark/velious dir onto 2 cdroms and just dumped it in
and redid luclin without updating old world textures. If you were not,
you have to reinstall the the whole thing up to luclin again then
luclin.

Is he on 98? Your and my computer are not really that suited to win
xp, which I would not even call an "upgrade" really for gaming yet.
