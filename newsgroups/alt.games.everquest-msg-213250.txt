I've heard a different one... what sounds like a toilet flushing, with 
an unclear sort of echoing voice talking in the background, in Kurns 
tower for example. Sounds like it was done with a cheap tape recorder.

I heard it maybe 10 or so times while I was doing a shm quest in the 
Tower over a week or so, but this was almost a year ago.

I haven't got a clue where it was from, and it was really annoying as it 
was considerably louder than the rest of the sound effects in the zone. 
I figured it for a developer prank, or maybe a place-holder sound that 
got missed and didn't get replaced with the correct one.
