If they are pretty lucky, yes. I expect your figure is above average.

Nope.

Really? I belong to a trade skill guild; we have several alchemists and many
tailors, and none of us manage to SELL any such things regularly. Rarely, more
likely.

Indeed, but unless you have 20k to level up to where you CAN make the high end
jewelry, AND can enchant the metals yourself, don't even bother.

One patch, months ago, changed the recipe for candied spider to produce 8
pieces, not 2. They forgot to change the price, though, so a single combine was
netting you a lot of cash. That lasted all of about 5 days before an
"emergency" patch fixed it. Now, the only fairly low level money maker for
tradeskillers  is patchwork armor. If you hunt bears, wolves and cats yourself,
you can take one ruined skin (free) and one pattern (purchased from a merchant
for about 5 silver) and sell the resulting patchwork armor to a merchant for
about 11sp.Expect that one to be nerfed pretty soon.

Of course not, because the gate potions are NO DROP. You can, though, sell
poison vials to rogues for their poison making skill, or to enchanters making
mana vials for tailors. Or you can spend lots and lots of money to work your
pottery skill to where you can make idols... except that very few people are
willing to buy them for even the cost of components.

We Americans do not have a right to oversee
our leaders, to demand upfront accountability
of their actions and to question their every
decision; this is the moral imperative and
duty of every citizen.
