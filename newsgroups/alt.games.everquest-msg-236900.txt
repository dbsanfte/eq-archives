Actually, with my curiosity piqued, I visited the thread he was
talking about, and found two interesting things...

1. Every top posting noob in the thread was using Outlook Express (as
of when I googled it).
2. Despite being challenged to do so not a single one came up with a
credible reason for top posting, nor a single usenet document
supporting it as a standard.

Guess we can add that newsgroup to the long list of those who prefer
bottomposting, with just a few arrogant topposting kooks trying to
stir the water. :-)
