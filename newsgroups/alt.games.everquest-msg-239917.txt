If you farm all your leather padding, your minimum loss per combine is 
something like 3pp on the most expensive of fine plate combines.  So in 
effect, the leather padding is the expensive part because it's not cost 
controlled by SoE's NPC merchants and there is no compensation for the 
prices charged in the bazaar when selling back to merchants.  Good method 
for farming padding is to AE the greyhoppers in marus seru for LQ pelts, 
then go kill the worms and lesser shades in shadeweaver's thicket for 
shadeling silks.

I personally suggest making embroidery needles to 122, saving all your 
successes, and then making cultural embroidery needles to 132.  You 
should end up netting about 500pp out of it, if you can get the cultural 
components yourself (I like Clockwork Koi, but whatever floats your boat; 
check www.eqtraders.com for a list of 'em, they're all obtainable at 
pretty much any level).  Note that you'll hit 132 well before you run out 
of needles, but get enough of the cultural stuff to make one out of every 
needle you made in the previous step, it's good plat :)  After that I 
went to fine plate, but you might want to do some ornate til 142.  I 
definitely do not recommend doing LDON smithing until after you've done 
all of fine plate at 188, and then only if you can't farm velium to make 
enchanted velium bits (yes, there's zero sellback on the bits, but the 
cost if you farm the velium yourself is less than the minimum loss on 
LDON plate).
