Well, I ran it again last night, and had the same result - the investigator
refuses to follow, and, while I can do the other parts running back and
forth, the guards won't arrest anyone and Donally never spawns. It's worth
noting that, in order to redo it, I had to go all the way back to the
beginning - do the initial piece including the spawn of the guard in NK.

My level is 54 BTW. From what I can see, I don't expect to have much
difficulty solo'ing things until I get to the final piece. Even then I could
probably solo or at least duo that piece, but I think I'm going to see if
the guild wants to make a fun night of doing the war.
