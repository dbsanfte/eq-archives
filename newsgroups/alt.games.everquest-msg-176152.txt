I've found items priced below what an NPC vendor will pay because of
people using just that method.  I load CHR gear, check what the vendor
will give me, then check the prices of player vendors.  Sometimes I go
buy from the players and make a small profit selling to the NPC, find
what the NPC sells it for and then set my price after eliminating my
competition.
