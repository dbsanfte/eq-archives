You're the second person to post this now.

I have never, ever heard that you would get in trouble for using Succor or
Egress to evac  to the other side of SG.  I mean, this is what the damn spell
is designed for.  To take you or your group to a specified point in the zone.
How the hell can they say it's an exploit to cast the spell as it's designed?

Or am I not understanding what you mean by the "self succor" tactic, something
that turns it into an exploit?
