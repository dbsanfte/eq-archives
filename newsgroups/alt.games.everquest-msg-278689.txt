Good point. I overstated "late in the game" quite a bit for EQ2. 

Still, for me at least, its at the beginning, when you first log in that 
I most crave diversity ...  Do I want to make an X or a Y or a Z?? I'll 
roll up one of each and see which feels best... in an archetype system 
this -is- pretty tedious, and utterly pointless, because I won't know 
anything until I get them *all* past the divergence level. :)
