If everyone can travel easily, high-demand camps become that much
more crowded.   How crowded would Rathe Mountains be if it was a
zone off of West Commonlands, for instance?   Zones get used because
they're safe and have reasonable loot or XP.   Getting into LoIO or OT
isn't exactly safe or easy, for instance, yet look how crowded they are.

Which "loss to their usefulness" is that, exactly?   I used to get a port to
NK when I wanted to hunt in SK.  Disband after the port, go get a group,
look for a port out later.  The druid/wizard got nothing except a few PP
for doing the port.   Today, if I want to go to the Hole, I take a porter
with me because I have to have some way to get the melee classes out
of the zone.   That's something that wouldn't be lost by being able to
have everyone form-up at Toxx without having porters jumping all over
picking up people.
