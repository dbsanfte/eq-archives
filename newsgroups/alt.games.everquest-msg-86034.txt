During battle my 11th lvl Bard uses the Chords of Dissonance but there's no way
to see what, if any, damage it does. Admittedly I've only played it in battle
without holding a Stringed Instrument in my hands. Is it worth using during
battle? or should I simply try to maintain Jonathan's Whistling Warsong when
fighting solo?

Thanks in advance. :)
