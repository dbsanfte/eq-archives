The Ballroom, marked #10 on the eqatlas.com map.  There is
a line of three gypsies which spawn in front of the piano
there.  The talons drop from them on occasion.  So
do the Mistmoore Battle Drums and the Lute of the Gypsy
Princess -- these are decent Bard items, save them and
either sell them or give them to a deserve Bard.  The
Gypsy Lute for the Lambent Armor quests also drops from
them, but it's No Drop, and any Bard who wants it will
have to be there with you (or you can pick it up and
complete that Lambent armor quest yourself, then give/sell
the resulting armor piece).

At night, the gypsy spawn positions spawn as werewolves.
I forget whether the talons drop from the gypsies themselves
or the werewolf forms, or both.  But I found several when
I was there gathering Bard items.

Or come to think of it, maybe the Musician is the separate
spawn that spawns on the other side of the "dance floor"
from the Gypsies...  It's been a while.  But I do know for
certain that the talons drop from at least one of the
mobs on the dance floor, so just wipe them all out and
you'll be good.

I don't see why not, I soloed the place as a 54 Paladin easily,
and my Shaman friend can generally solo stuff better than I
can at the same level.  The best place to fight from is the
southwest corner of the ballroom -- up on the "sidewalk",
not down inside the dance floor itself.

The easiest spot to break the room from is the round room
just north of room #11 on the eqatlas map.  Get to there
invisible, then break invis and fight the one spawn that's
there.  Then work your way one mob at a time into room #10,
clearing the "sidewalk" perimeter first before you set up
operations at the SW corner and start pulling from the
dance floor.

Just be aware that if Synthi Davisi spawns, she's an
enchanter, keep your Magic Resistance up.

Also, your invisibility won't work on the undead that
often spawn in the zone -- just about any spawn in
Mistmoore will be either live, or undead, depending on
what time of EQ day it spawns.  So watch your step.
