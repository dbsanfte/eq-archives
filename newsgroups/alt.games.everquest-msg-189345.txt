Eh,  my 61 enc is not affected.  Even if he was 65 it wouldn't affect me
since I hate the bother of charming.

And pet aggro management...'bout time enchanters had to learn it.  I know an
enchanter who had nothing else to do so he chain-nuked critters on a
mini-raid and couldn't understand why he kept getting aggro and why that was
a BAD thing.  Now on his necro he's piling on his dots, getting aggro and
STILL not understanding why this is a bad thing.
