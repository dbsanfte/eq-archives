I sympathise with your situation (I play a druid myself, and though
I prefer to group, depending on when you're on it's not always
possible, etc etc) Yes, I have used KEI, but I'm glad that they've
patched it out of the game for <46 characters, simply because it
was *so* good it totally eclipsed the other possibilities for mana
regen in the game.

The issue isn't KEI vs soloing, it's mana vs soloing, and aside
from the other levels of the clarity line, there are plenty of mana
regen items in the game, 0mana clickies, that can help your
soloing experience. Even just increasing the mana pool can
make the diference.

Of course, the flipside of this is a lot of people expect that
everyone can go out and just shell out thousands of PP on
these items... and that is not how some of us play our game
(I make it a choice not to buy any item I couldn't concievably
get myself, even though I could easily afford it). But its probably
not fair to dismiss people as whiners on this basis.
