Thank you for the post, Dilettante. I have no plans to become rich in EQ.
I've already seen that it IS possible, but the ways of getting there are
very dull. All  I want is enough cash to buy Darklet (my druid) some more
armor. She's in rags now, though thanks to my ex boyfriend, she has a few
nice items, mainly weapons. I don't think I'll have to shell out cash for
another weapon anytime soon, but then, I've been known to be wrong before
;). I have a Glowing Wooden Crook I sometimes use, a FS Scimitar I seldom
use, and a magical club that is absolutely *awesome* (which I use as my
primary weapon these days) though I can't recall the name of it now. Another
player <gave> it to me a few weeks ago. She also has some nice +wis items,
though she'll need more and better, one of these days. Unfortunately, I
don't group, so my casters (mage and enchanter) are gonna have to do it on
their own. I did make some cash killing wisps for lightstones, and I really
need to do that gypsy quest thing for the book -- seems I'll make more going
that route. My casters actually have a few nice pieces for their level
(again, donated by ex boyfriend from some of his guild raids when they got
robes and stuff that no one else wanted or could use). And I'm told that
when they get a bit higher, I won't be doing much in the way of meleeing
anyway (though I would miss that part -- I sometimes tank for my pet), so I
suppose I don't need to upgrade from my Mithril Quill anytime soon. (I
forget what my mage has... a staff, I think... runed totem staff maybe? and
a Dragoon Dirk) I'm actually more worried about being able to afford +items
for them. That stuff ain't cheap by any means. Shit, that reminds me, I
accidentally sold one of my spare rings last night that I was going to give
to enchanter... got 89pp for it, but I'd really rather have the ring. Oh
well.

thanks,
Dark
