Well, again, that's assuming that you take the biblical story completely at
face value.  Let's assume that is true, so, then the argument here would be
that might makes right?  They committed genocide, took over the land, and
therefor it should be theirs for eternity?

Personally, I don't think that going back in history and deciding who owned
the land hundreds or thousands of years ago is a reasonable approach, it's
just that that argument is the one often used for why Israel should exist.
I'm generally much more practical than that, they are there now, and short
of just killing everyone off, they are going to continue to be there, so,
what is the best approach to allow everyone to live there in a reasonably
peaceful manner?  Wish I knew the answer to that one, I could use that Nobel
prize award.
