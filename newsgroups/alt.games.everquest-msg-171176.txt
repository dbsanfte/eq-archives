Since the OP was asking about a Ranger I looked at it from that point of 
view. However based on what you are saying, I can see where it would be a 
problem for a monk. Now I don't know the first thing about monks, but I 
only count 14 possible button skills, and that includes forage, and beg. 
(Gleaming this off of Casters Realm) The forage would only be for the 
Lizzies I suppose. I guess irregardless, if there are more than that, and 
monks regularly use them, there could be a good point for having another 
skill bank just in case.
