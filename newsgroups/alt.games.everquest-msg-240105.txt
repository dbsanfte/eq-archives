Just out of curiousity, did you happen to be near a wayfarers camp
around the time when they start talking about a fireworks display?

I was showing some guy the nagafens effect on my fireworks staff,
right after the npcs there also mentioned a fireworks display. Then
there was some text about a ground explosion. My staff went off then
THEIR fireworks display really went off with big explosions and four
weird dragon head looking things. 

The guy went "WHOAH I HAVE TO GET THAT." So I waited until the display
was done and then explained that most of that was theirs, then fired
mine off again. he still seemed somewhat impressed and said he was
going to do the quest, though.
