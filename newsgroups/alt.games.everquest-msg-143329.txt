Perhaps it's a bit buggy then,(most likely) or perhaps you need to reapply
the instaclick before the fight.  (Not sure if this is true or not, but I
keep reapplying it while buffing.  Nothing worse than finding out your 20
minutes on the buff ran out 1 second before MGB Aegolism hit you.)  but I
have fought a *lot* of dragons, and they have almost always taken the buffs
in order.  (once or twice I can remeber a skip, but very very rarely, and
that might have been an effect of AE bard song flopping thorugh the buff
slots.)

I use my instaclick ring constantly right after the dispell, and only when
I'm lagged do I lose a second buff.   Which is pretty much always one of the
2 crap buffs I use in the slot immediately under the ring instaclick.

Telk in ToV does this, Klandicar, Sontalak (not with him facing you of
course) Talendor and Faydear.  Most of the rest of the West Wastes dragons
too.

The spell dispells also usually hit me in the same order, but since they can
cancel multiple buffs at once, I usually lose the first three or so..   It
might jump more as well, as I can remember a great deal more skips with the
spell hitting me.  *shrug*


(On your ToV trip, it's unlikely that you fought a dispeller.  The normal
mobs don't except by cast, just some of the named.)
