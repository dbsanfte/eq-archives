OK, BTW as I noted in one there is one section I think I didnt get across
clearly which I think may have been a source of confusion on where I was
coming from....

Yes, my argument isnt that - I am aware of that, and its probably why I
will never spend very much time playing at that level. My comments were
very much not that this is the setup, but that the solution SOE use to
Martin's problem is, to my mind, not a good solution. I dont like the fact
that if they dont want looting at that level they havent done something
about it properly instead of using GMs and a PNP to sort the
problem...because as Martin has painfully found out it doesnt work
reliably.

Yes there is an element of me not liking the fact the roleplaying idea is
lost but then I was trying to temper that out by looking at solutions

Yes, agreed, very much so - and GM ie human interference in game/in
character (however you wish to phrase it) is not what I consider a good
way...thats what I meant by GMs shouldnt be involved....not that the rules
are setup and thats the response to expect - but that the current system
aint good enough.

GM inteference and changes like this also run the risk IMO/E of putting
off people of lower level and producing more elitism resentment than a
code change that simply happens with no human agency.

Hence, I think they should not be having GMs in there in game, but
actually fixing the problem - the player community can do a LOT to make
sure this guy messing with the high level game gets his comeuppnace as
well...as people say there arent that many people there.
