I didn't have the advantage of there being higher level players around
when I started my first character on day one, so consider yourself
lucky :)

I do vividly remember the first experiences of EQ though, wandering
around totally lost in Butcherblock, and to this day I envy true
newbies for that phase of discovery.

The first time I got well and truly lost and somehow stumbled into the
passage to Dagnor's Cauldron with my below-10 Dwarven warrior was,
well, terrifying and thrilling. Knowing I might lose everything I'd
collected because I had no idea where I was, and having no idea how to
get back to familiar territory was a *lot* of fun, and very exciting.

>As for the rest of the changes, I kinda like the no book thing

I do too. I've always considered the staring-at-spellbook thing rather
pointless. I do understand the RP feeling some folks have about it,
but never felt that way myself.
