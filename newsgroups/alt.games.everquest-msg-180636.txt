Please define "test enough".  Or don't bother, since it seems likely
that truth value of your sweeping generalization approximates nil.

Fascinating.  Now you expect us to accept that a casual review of
bitch threads gives an accurate picture of SOE's overall response
to /bug reports on Test?

While it's no doubt possible to argue that changes to the spell
database constitute "code", it's certain to be a losing argument.

Oh, excellent!  Yet another unwarranted assumption bordering on
willful ignorance.

There are plenty of opportunities for constructive criticism of
specific flaws in EQ and/or policies of SOE.  But to do that you'd
have to expend actual thought, and it is not at all clear that you
are capable of that.  Vague and unsupportable charges of general
incompetence are just so much easier to vomit forth, eh?
