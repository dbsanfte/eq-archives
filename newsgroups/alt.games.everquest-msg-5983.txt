Last night sucked for me, I had just dinged 24 the night before and got all
my spells.  Was hitting on the no good poaching Millers in QH, when resist
after resist I had to run to Surefall zone.  Enough of that! let me go
exploring, hey I never tried to improve gnome faction to get my
Bootstrutters pack!  Head over to Steamfont via Butcherblock ring, Doh!!
forgot I have new Steamfont spell, too late!  head down to the Mines of
Malfunction, and start clearing out trash looking for Red V to spawn. Ignite
on a gnome skeleton and whammy 3 gnomes come out of no where and owned my
ass for 350 a hit!  Now I'm back at lvl 23 and leaving the gnomes alone!
I'll take on something easier like Broon the cyclops, gnomes are too tough
for me!
