"Ding" is fine, at least in many zones.  There are places where people
tend to go and stay for 2 or 3 or more levels.  After a while, they
become familiar, you joke with then on OOC between spawns, etc..  They
probably DO care that you leveled.

8a) Don't leave out words.  *It* looks stupid. :-)

I too dislike "plz" and "thx" and "U", however, I think this is a
losing battle, because of wireless text messaging.  That is starting
to catch on in the US, and is wildly popular in Europe (and, I think,
Japan).  When trying to get a message down to 120 (or whatever the
limit is) characters, abbreviations like those are very helpful.
