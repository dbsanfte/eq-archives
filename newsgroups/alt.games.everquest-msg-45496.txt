Lots of fun :o
I created an Ogre warrior
and with 4 other Ogre Warriors we crossed Norrath all the way to Freeport
(Sro and Oasis at lvl 1 are not fun =)
Every zone we crossed we shouted various Ogre warnings to da hoomans !
Hehe, The Human newbs in WP were sure suprised to see 5 naked Ogre Warriors
running around =)
