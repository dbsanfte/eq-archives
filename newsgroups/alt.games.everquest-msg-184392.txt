Just hit level 19 with my druid and got the spell cancel magic.

Have been trying out on myself and it doesn't seem to do much. I get
all buffed up and cast cancel magic and none of my buffs leave me. I
cast snare on myself and it -does- seem to remove that. However it
doesn't seem to remove root.

I was planning on doing the hermit in SK for the next few levels but
his attack is to root you and I was hoping that CM would remove it but
it doesn't seem to.


My first couple of attempts on him have had mixed success. First time
I charmed an elephant and sent it in. Somehow it managed to get inside
the house with him and started belting him. I snared him, DOT, and a
couple of DD's. By the time the elephant died I had run a fair way off
and rooted him and DD'd him to death. Seemed to work fairly well.

Tried the same thing next time but with charm you never know when it's
going to run out. Problem is this time I buffed the elephant right up
hoping it would take him right down. I sent it in and 5 seconds later
the charm has broke so now I got a buffed elephant and a yellow hermit
after me. Luckily the hermit didn't seem to root me and I managed to
get away.

I thought I was in the clear, I couldn't see either the hermit or the
elephant. Next thing the hermit just -appeared- in front of me. Is
this some kind of bug ? He was nowhere to be seen and then I get the
message " a hermit has hit you for 35 points damage" and he appeared
as if by magic wailing on me. I ran off again, got far enough away and
rooted him. Ok I thought, he's down to 1/3 health, I got half my mana
left so i'll DOT him and meditate. Finally he rooted me but I wasn't
worried as he was rooted too and I had plenty of mana.

So I sat down and meditated while DOT done it's thing and was thinking
to myself "this isn't going to be too hard" My confidence was short
lived though as the next thing I knew I was hearing the "bad" damage
sound and get the message "an elephant has hit you for 44 points
damage" or something like that. Uh oh this could be bad I thought. I
was rooted and facing the wrong way so all I could do was stand there
like vegetable while the elephant wailed on me. The gods must have
favored me though... as I sat there helpless the root icon started to
flash. It seemed an eternity that that icon flashed as I watched my
health slowly sap away. Eventually it disappeared and I was free at
last ! I ran off as fast I could.

Unfortunately I ran into an interrogator. I conned it and he was red &
indifferent. No threat from him I thought. I stopped and tried to
snare the elephant but unfortunately I forgot to switch targets and I
ended up trying to snare the interrogator. He resisted of course so
now I had him after me as well :)

He managed to get a hit on me for 65 damage so I knew I was toast if
he hit me anymore. I lost my heading in all the confusion and ran
right back into the hermit. He was still rooted so I quickly turned
and headed the other way. Three seconds later I get the message my
root had worn off :)

So I just kept running. And running. I would turn every now and then
to see how far they were away. After a few minutes of not knowing
where I was going or what I might run into I turned to see they were
miles off. I stopped and cast gate. It took forever to cast as I
watched my three assailants close on me. Finally it finished when they
were about ten feet from me.

Back at my bind point with about 1/8th of my health and no mana :)

I am really enjoying this game :)
