These changes are going on with Sullon as well, as I understand it.
Right? From what I can tell, none of them address the largest problem
with SZ... I doubt anyone finds it fun to run out with their level 10
warrior and get vaporized by some level 60 wizard "because he can".

Put in the level restriction, even if it is broader than on normal PvP
servers. Totally open range is absurd. This, to me, is an issue of
realism vs. fun. Sure, it may be fun for the bored level 60, but it
sure as hell isn't for the level 10.

Also, reinstate the rules against zone/portal/bind camping. There is
no realism at work here. It's purely use of game mechanics against
other players.
