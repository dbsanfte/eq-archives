OR you could only play the lowbie character when you know the other guy
is going to be on, so you don't get out of step. I maintain two
character for just that reason; one to play with the wife, one to play
with another friend who doesn't get to play very often. My wife does
the same. Then we use any downtime the other has to catch up on
tradeskills on those characters. Works extraordinarily well.
