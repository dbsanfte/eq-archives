Before I get EQ2 I'd like some knowledgeable opinions as to whether
or not it will run well enough on my system. I don't trust the
minimum/recommended hardware specs provided by game publishers.

Intel D875PBZ motherboard, P4(R) 2.4GHz, 512MB PC3200 DDR ram, ATi
Radeon 9800 Pro 128MB, 16x DVD rom, high speed (cable) internet
connection

How about it guys? Should it handle EQ2 well enough, or will it
barely choke and chug along even at the lowest detail settings?

Thanks,
