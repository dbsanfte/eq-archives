Hotkeys and other client layouts have nothing to do with the
"<soandso> saved" messages. The saved messages are your character
information has been saved SERVER SIDE. Hotkeys and such are saved
client side (or are supposed to be) when you set them up... Most
likely, though I'm not sure I've never asked or been told on the
matter so I'm giving it my best shot, the client side info is written
to the appropriate ini files when you zone, log, or respawn after
death. Possible there's something with your PC that's keeping it from
writing to these files?
