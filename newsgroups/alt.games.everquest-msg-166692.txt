Another way of agro management i have found is root! (assumeing you are 
fighting something that can be rooted) Get it back to camp and get it 
rooted it will attack the closest person to it (most of the time) and 
also great if someone gets agro that shouldn't (such as a cleric or that 
over nukeing wizzy)
