Bah...did my first Hate raid 4 bubbles into 46, when the
highest level folks were all level 50.  Died a couple of times
(which is downright scary at 46 :-)  ), but generally had
a good time.

These day, porting up at 46-47 is _almost_ safe...certainly
as safe as zoning in to Howling Stones or Old Sebilis.  Unless
your entire raid is all level 47, AND it's their first trip to a
Plane at all.  My alt rogue has hit Hate twice and Fear once
in level 47-ding 48, and was far and away completely safe
surrounded by a bunch of 53+ folks who were all raid-skilled
and disciplined.  I don't think she took a single point of
damage the entire Fear raid, and was almost unnoticed on
the Hate raids, aside from being in the KS group all 3 raids.

Camping the Planes for exp can be fun...
:-)
