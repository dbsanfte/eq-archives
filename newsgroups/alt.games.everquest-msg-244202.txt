Happened today in SOL B

After dinging my monk to 43 I decided to go to this zone for some good EXP.
Get a dark Blue Kobald when i first zone in and drop him without any
problems, then I grab another and when he gets to 20% he takes off running.
No big deal I thought.  Unfortunately the beast runs right into the room
with a Fabled Kobald Noble, I get Charmed and then run back to entrance.
Two other players get killed because of this and I end up in tells with some
pretty pissed off people.  Once charm broke and the mezz that was on me I
was able to do a quick FD with 12% life left, right at the feet of the
Fabled Noble.  Once health back up I do a quick stand, move and FD, I was
actually mezzed by the time FD kicked in so I am FD and mezzed.  Took a few
minutes but I finally made it outside of the Fable's agro range.

One of the two that got killed because of this understood after I explained
that I was charmed and did not knowingly train him.  The other person
logged.

SONY, you have screwed my reputation up with two players now because of your
warped sense of hummor about putting epic like encounters almost at the
front doors of many of these mid level zones.
