PoK, PoTranq (ok, we won't count those two).

PoN, PoD, PoV, PoS, Tactics, Torment, BoT, PoI, all open or possible with
one group to open.

Versus, Sol Ro, PoF, PoE, PoW, PoA, and PoEb and PoTime (both total raid
zones, so you're not missing anything you'd wanna do anyway).

So actually, "half the zones in PoP" are quite available.  =)
