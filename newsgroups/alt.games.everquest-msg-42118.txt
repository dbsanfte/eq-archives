LOL, really sure, yes. The thing is, I'm pretty sure that when I had
only the chipped peridot in a bag, it did, in fact, increase my AC and
SvCold. Adding a couple more (not peridot) chipped gems after the
recent patch seemed to turn them all off. I don't know if 1) I was
wrong about the initial effect 2) having more than one chipped gem
negates having any at all (even putting all but one of them in the
bank had no effect one way or the other) or 3) the latest patch
somehow broke the things.
