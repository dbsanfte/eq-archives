No, the addition of a geerlok will not mean that you won't get skill 
ups. As you noticed, you didn't get the 'no longer advance' message.
It's just that, once over that 200 mark, the skill ups are few and
far between (says the woman at 226 in fletching and getting 2 or 3
skill ups per 100 combines, if she's lucky.)
