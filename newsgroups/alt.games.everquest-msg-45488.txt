Mandrake 8, and to my eternal embarrassment, I totally let it set itself 
up. :) I've done it the hard way a few times, with freeBSD and Red Hat 4, 
but as I get older, I find that I'm more and more willing to let the OS do 
the work. 

Then again, the problem may not be with EQ. After a reboot, it looks like 
the connection sharing has fritzed. The machines can ping each other, and I 
can see apache in the Linux box, but I have no more access to the web from 
the Windows box. Man, I really do hate computers some times.
