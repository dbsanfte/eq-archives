One more tiny thing:

People didn't leave EQ because it was hard.  They left because it was
old and new games with big potential were coming out and (from what
I've read) GoD sucked complete ass.

People don't avoid EQ because it's hard.  They avoid it because it's
old and inaccessible.  I returned after being gone since Luclin and I
feel completely locked out of the game.  The complete derth of low
level people (low level as in <30, not <70) is killer.  It means the
only way to start playing is to buy some plat, buy some skinspikes,
beg for a temp and go solo for 3 months.  Which is mindnumbingly
boring and not at all in the spirit of EQ.  There are no groups at any
level I've been at since returning unless you know people already.
Not because you're too lazy to form a group, because there's literally
NO-ONE within 10 levels of you that isn't in trader mode in the
bazaar.

The only thing keeping me mildly interested is the fact that I know
one person who plays, so I have someone to play with.  I really miss
the fun I had in this game in the past, and I'm sure I could have that
fun again if I bought a level 75 character.  But that's not something
I want to do.

It's not "difficulty." It's barrier to entry.   If it was difficulty,
people wouldn't play the hundreds of console games that require more
"skill" than MMOs.
