The point remains the same except for making the process a
bit longer.

Completely naked, I'd still as a half-elf rogue get a bind
in Oggok.  I can sneak/hide to bank and sell there in my
un-illusioned form anyways.

My H2H skill is maxxed.  I think I could start killing some
waaaaaay green skeletons or lizards in the swamp for
a rusty weapon (1hb, 1hs, pierce...doesn't matter).  Save
some money for a pair of daggers or even two rapiers.

Move in to Cazic Thule.  Farm defenders+ for coin and
fine steel.  Increase money, find 2 FS rapiers (many times
dropped off of Sentinals).  Keep at it until I have money
I need to buy banded or whatnot, or until I can get some
of my Ravenscale to drop.  RS would suck at level 60, but
still better by a long shot than banded.

The only thing the no-drop  stuff I have would save me is
time.  I can bare-handed kill stuff 30 levels below me
with no sweat...I just miss the backstabs.

Wonder what Duelist would look like hand-to-hand?
;-)
