The only person I found even vaguely challenging post L20 was the
Telvani in the corpus tower and Vivec himself. Both of these are
integral to the plot however, so you're not supposed to kill them. Hell,
even Dagoth was a pushover. Ascended Sleepers, Golden Saints and 6th
House higherups were all 2-3shot kills.

Finshed this game - going back to get a full set of Daedric (just
because) then it's on to NWN between EQ sessions.

But I agree with the OP. At earlier levels, it's an awesome game, and
it's worth getting just for that.
