Being only a lvl25 mage, i ask myself questions of these types. How should 
work my pet? Does the group want me to malise? While you can take all the 
advice that you gather, I think you should also try to experiment and try 
to figure out on your own whats your role. Being able to bash is awsome, 
and being able to heal and semi-tank is also VERY valuable. I think all 
classes are equal. Some better in other areas then others, and thats what 
makes some classes seem worse. Hell in some groups I will pull and tank, 
i've been told i am great puller, almost never getting to many pulls. Sorry 
I cant give any insight as to what you should be focusing on now, but just 
really go with what you think is best, and use your common sense, if the 
second mob breaks free and goes after a caster, then yeah help protect that 
caster all you can, try to root it and save the caster. If a caster mob 
starts to cast then try to stun it. Just try to use common sense and you'll 
be a great addition to any group.
