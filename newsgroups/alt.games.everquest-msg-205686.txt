AFAIK, the only things that affect misses are weapon and offense skills, and
level relative to the mob.  So once you've capped your skills, there's
basically nothing you can do.  As a shaman, you have lower caps on weapon
and offense skills than melee characters (warrior, rogue, hybrids etc.) so
you'll miss a lot more than they will.  As a hybrid against low dark blues,
I typically miss 40 to 45% of the time at level 60.
