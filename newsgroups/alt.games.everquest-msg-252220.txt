> Well, they don't have a clue now, either.

You don't think Microsoft has a clue? Well then define what it means to have
a clue because I'm at a loss to understand what you mean unless what you're
really saying is that you don't like them or don't like the things that they
do. That's different. But clued in they are. They're using some of the same
tactics to gain dominance of the game business as they did in the
productivity software business. They let others pioneer the way and then
when they smell the money they come in through an acquisition and use their
channel presence and marketing war chest to gain share from everyone else.
They don't always succeed, but then the most successful venture capital
players don't always succeed either, they expect 4 out of 5 ventures to
fail. It only takes a few big hits to make all the rest of the investments
pay off. For every Asheron's Call or FASA that didn't really pay off,
there's an Age of Empires that did. New investments currently underway are
pretty interesting, including Vanguard, Brad McQuaid's new effort (McQuaid
was one of the principal designers of EverQuest) and of course XBox. Going
from "Flight Simulator" and "Fury" to the next generation MMORPG from the
creator of EverQuest and re-defining console gaming looks like pretty good
progress to me.

Yeah it didn't stay high margin very long, did it. In the beginning when you
could get away with a floppy disk in a baggy and a photocopied manual (e.g.,
the first Broderbund game I ever bought), and retailers were begging for
product, that was high margin. But it didn't take long for the COGS to jump
up pretty high. I wonder how many people reading this remember games like
Wing Commander III, The Incredible Machine, Stonekeep, Day of the Tentacle,
and other games like that and the packaging they came in. LOL it got so bad
that the entire industry had to move to standard sized boxes. And then
there's the whole issue now of having to pay retailers for shelf space, and
that's on top of distribution cuts. And all for the tiny little pittance
that publishers get for a one-shot sale with no future revenue potential.
Brutal business.

When did they ever release anything that was truly innovative and since when
has that been a core part of their success?

Yep. I think I lost interest in the adventure thing before most others, I
remember dropping out of it well before Time Zone and the Quest series
started happening. I was convinced that whole segment was dead once
Phantasmagoria came out. And look what they did to Gabriel Knight. There
were some other nice adventures still tryng to keep the old model alive,
like Monkey Island, Full Throttle, Sam & Max.

Yeah, the death march at the end of these cycles is ugly, with a lot of good
and otherwise smart people stuck in what amounts to an infinite hope loop.
