As far as I know you basically get 1 faction hit per frog, live or
dead.  I was KOS to live frogs from hunting upper guk, then did a LOT
of dead side hunting to be non-KOS, then went back from hunting live
side.  I generally wouldn't worry about it, since at your level
they're not gonna be able to do much to you, and you should be able to
run to the dry zone-in without any trouble.  That has the additional
advantage of putting you right at the dead-side, with only a couple
live froggies to deal with, and they're almost alwasy dead anyway.
(Of course I was always amazed at how many people preferred to swim
into lower guk, different strokes I guess.)
