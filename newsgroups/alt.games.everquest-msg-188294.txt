"Windows 95 Can Access Up to Two GB of RAM
The information in this article applies to:
Microsoft Windows 95

This article was previously published under Q181594 
SYMPTOMS

If you install more than two gigabytes (GB) of memory (RAM) in your
computer, you may be able to use only two GB of RAM in Windows 95. 
CAUSE

Although Windows 95 has the ability to address up to four GB of
virtual memory, it can access and use only two GB or less of physical
RAM. 

Last Reviewed: 12/17/2000 
Keywords: kbenv kbprb KB181594 "



Shared video memory seems to be the cause of any 1 gig limit:

"PRB: Blue Screen Appears When You Start Computer with 1 GB or More of
RAM
The information in this article applies to:
Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition
Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition
Microsoft Windows 98

This article was previously published under Q311871 
SYMPTOMS

If your computer has 1 gigabyte (GB) or more of random access memory
(RAM) with shared video memory, the computer may boot to a blue screen
error when you try to start Windows Millennium Edition (Me) or Windows
98. "


NT/2K/XP are unaffected.


Nt 4 had a 4 gig limit, which was upped in service pack 2 and later:

http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;160392

"...SYMPTOMS
Systems with 4 GB or more of RAM will fail to boot. The system fails
with a stop message 0x0000003f NO_MORE_SYSTEM_PTES. 
WORKAROUND
This has been fixed in Ntoskrnl.exe in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2
and later."
