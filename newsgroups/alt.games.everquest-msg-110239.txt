I agree with you there. I just find it really amusing that people take the
time to complain / flame about html posts of 1-2k in size. 10k+, ok, I can
understand that, esp. if you're on dial-up. But most people never even point
out to the person how to change it - they just haul out their
Usenet-approved flamethrower.....
