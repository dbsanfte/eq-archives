Keep in mind that not all "casters" are created equal. As a chanter,
you'll be one of the more fragile of the bunch, and yes, you'll give up
melee almost entirely fairly early on. Clerics are a plate class, and
with decent armor and bashing weapons, they can carry on a good deal
longer. Shamans are even more robust, in my experience, and they solo
fairly well, so I know some in their mid fifties that are still doing
some melee from time to time.

But for you chanters? Put your weapons away and get used to everyone
else taking care of your butt. he he he.
