For those who attempted to help me with my crashing a few days ago, I think
you.
I appear to have solved it.
Just to refresh,
I have an AMD Athlon 1700+ XP
Gigabyte GA-7DXR M/board
512MB DDR
Geforce 2 GTS Ti

Originally running windows XP I have been getting crashing since Verant
updated to the DX8.1 ver of the client/graphics engine.
Not since the install of luclin which came a week after.
I tried all the "endless loop" suggestions, modifying my CAS latency etc.
I even reverted back to windows 98 (2nd ED)
None of which solved my problem, or even seemed to have any effect at all.
Tonight I changed my drivers back to some I have kept from early march.
(0650 version I think)
Although they didn't have the Titantiums back then, so I told it to load the
standard GTS drivers.
Previously this evening the game has run for no more than 50min, and more
often only as long as 10.

Since loading the old drivers it has run for more than 2 hours.

Once again, thanks for trying and if you are having this same prob, maybe
try this.
