From a pure logic point of view, monks are a class which gets damage
migation based upon their ability to avoid or "roll with" a punch.  Give
me a quarterstaff against a reasonably trained martial artist and I
may never inflict severe damage.   That same situation where the
martial artist is weighed down with a 90# bag is going to be a different
situation even if he can reasonably carry 100#.
