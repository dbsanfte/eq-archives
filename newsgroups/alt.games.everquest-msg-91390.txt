    I kinda have to agree with Pete here.  The
most fun I've had in EQ is when I've felt a "real"
sense of danger (to my character.  I still know 
that I'm playing a game). 
    One of the more intense experiences I remember
is running to Loio from FV on a CR, level 15 with
my gnome wizard.  No invis, no SoW, and no lev,
and everything deep, deep red and hungry for my
blood.  Yes, I knew that the spiders have a low
agro range, but there were a lot of them, they
were much bigger than me, and it seems that a 
few were falling from the sky randomly (I might
guess this was a graphics glitch).
   In real life, my heart was beating faster.
And it was fun.

            she makes that run.
