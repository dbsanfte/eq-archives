If your at all worried about allergic reactions you could possibly cut down 
the likelyhood of that by getting a frozen dinner with some sort of a berry 
dish in it ( Cobblers seem to be popular ), since Peppers are a member of 
the berry family. That way its out in public view that there are at least 
the berrries in seen on the menu.

As to asthma, Meh, if they are any sort of asthmatic that the shortness of 
breath would be a problem for then they almost CERTIANLY will have an 
inhaler of Albuteraol on them. I know I dont leave home without mine.

Good luck on your campaign :)
