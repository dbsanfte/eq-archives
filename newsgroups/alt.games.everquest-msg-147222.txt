Warfare from horseback... it's a funny old game...

Just ask the Turks, who generally rode mares because they were easier to
control... when they faced Christians who rode stallions because they're
stronger

Quite a few of the mares were 'in season'... and the stallions could smell
it... there were a LOT of very worried Turks! :oD
