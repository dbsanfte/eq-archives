I have to admit, this sounded fun at first; but after a brief, bored run on
test taking my newbie necro to lvl 3. . . .   BLEH! Leveling is far from
impossible, but I suspect having a good knowledge of the game made the
difference. For a real newbie who doesn't know their way around and hasn't
figured out /loc yet, it would be extremely frustrating. There are entirely
too many bored juveniles ganking newbies/lowbies when they respawn to even
make it worth the effort to play. Maybe it'll be better when the novelty wears
off.  Wonder when the *real* servers are going to come up? /sighs heavily
