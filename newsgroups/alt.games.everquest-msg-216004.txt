Ah, I did encounter him once then, as I recall the CR was amusing and involved a couple
deaths to get the body out of the way.  But if thats the guy we are talking about here
then why would he occaisionally wipe Aruvgan's group?  I thought maybe there was some
other high level iksar monk out there that did wander, although I've never seen or heard
of him.  Perhaps on Aru's server bards like to pull him to the other side of KC and let
him roam back so they can listen to the screams?  Wearing that DE mask can do evil
things to a bard sometimes...
