It takes that much time to reach 20th if you already know the game, 
where to get your spells, how to set up hotkeys, and know which zones to 
go to. He could easily get his "Evil Erudite Cleric" up to 5th level in 
the newbie yard, and then spend a week trying to get to twenty in the 
warrens by himself...

Or he could go to the plane of knowledge and hook up with a bandit group 
in PC, and level like crazy.

Sad thing is, he'll be a much better player if he manages to solo up in 
the warrens, despite everyone's advice on how and where to crank out 20 
levels in <10 hours he won't learn a thing doing it.
