Because by CoH's definitions that's NOT kill stealing.

If you haven't damaged it, it's not YOURS.  Even if you have, it's not
really.

Get it yet, Kill Stealing as you think of it DOES NOT EXIST.

Cute reading.

When idiots like this start in there's almost always broadcasts about
it.
So when I Petition Bobo, i'm not saying "Bobo kill stole my boss", I'm
saying "Bobo is going around sniping the bosses from everyone's kills"

GM shows up, GM observes Bobo, GM tells Bobo "stop or else".
Bobo stops or Bobo gets his account suspended.

You're the one calling it a loophole not me.

Newsflash: The term "Kill stealing" predates EQ by well over a decade.

You have heard of MUDs right?

Whatever.   From the sounds of it you have people "claiming" entire
areas as their exclusive zone to farm.

No it's not - because there is no loot there's no looting rights and the
influence and exp payments go to everyone who did _any_ damage not just
the one who landed the final blow or the one who did the most damage.

Hell i've been killed fighting something and then, still in the
hospital, received influence, exp and an insp and/or enhancement when
someone else killed the critter that killed me.

I might not even be in the same ZONE when that's happened, since
hospital don't exist in all zones.

They've made it pretty clear that any behavior that infringes on another
players enjoyment of the game is harassment.

Actually, from my personal experience, that has covered ALL of the time.
Not once have I ever had someone "kill steal" me twice.

Wrong, because people broadcast when someone "helps" them like this so
when other people get "helped" the petition the "helper" as someone who
is systematically "helping" players.

No you can't.  By the rules you cannot "own" a mob in COH.

Players can consider it theirs all they like, but that's a convention,
not the rules.

The only mobs that are "yours" are the ones in your door missions, the
door missions no one else can enter unless you invite them to team with
you.

You cannot claim ANY mob in CoH.  

Don't you get that yet, there is NO OWNERSHIP.

People may consider the orcs "yours" as a courtesy, but you can't CLAIM
ownership of them in CoH.

Obviously this is not true since you're applying your EQ based rules to
a game that does not support them.

You still don't get it.  There is no ownership.

Anything on the street is open season except by courtesy.

As explained above unless they're exceedingly careful about it, they are
going to get petitioned for general harassment of multiple players.

It's happened.
