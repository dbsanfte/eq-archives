I'd think if you had a hardware failure it'd show up other places.

You could try running the installer under XP's win98 compatibility mode, but
don't know if that would help. Your other possibly painful option is to try
reinstalling XP. If you put the disk in and select Install rather than
Upgrade you should get the option to do a system repair. Again, no idea if
this would help or not, but it's something to try.
