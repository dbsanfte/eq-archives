The best place to start would be right there in Field of Bone.
There is a human bandit camp there, in the northwest part of the
zone if memory serves. Killing these should raise faction with 
Qeynos and Highpass guards.

Well, the other shaman guilds on Norrath, outside Kunark, are in 
Halas, Oggok, and Grobb -- three cities where faction building is 
extremely difficult if not impossible in some cases.

If you have the SoL expansion, Shar Vahl and Shadowhaven are much
more viable options, probably requiring little or no faction work.
I am not sure about Iksar acceptance in those cities, but they
seem to tolerate most everyone.
