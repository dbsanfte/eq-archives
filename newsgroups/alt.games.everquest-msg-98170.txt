Ummm, they've had those since release.  They're called dungeons.  Nobody used 
them, so now Verant is trying to make them more attractive.  Why don't you go 
explore all the zones appropriate to your level, then come back and continue 
bitching.  If you don't know which zones are appropriate, this link should help:

As to having equipment drop only for people of the appropriate level, it's 
called Trival Loot Code, Verant tried it.  The vast majority of the playerbase 
hated it.
