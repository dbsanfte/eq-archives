Ok, so I've finally gotten to 51, actually about 20% into it now.  I
understand the progression of how aa points are spent, but have some
questions on earning them.  

Does the AA XP bar move the same as your regular XP bar?  Meaning,
would a mob that gives 1% regular experience give 1% AA experience if
I set it to 100% AA or is it faster/slower than normal experience?

Secondly, any recommndations on when to start going for AA, what
abilities to get, what % to AA, etc... would be appreciated.

I am a Barb Shaman, er Mystic, yeah, that's the ticket.

Thanks to all in advance.
