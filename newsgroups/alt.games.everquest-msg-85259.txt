I'd like to be able to stop people inspecting you

j/k

Although ideas come to me when playing they can't be that important because
I can think of them now.

If you can have more spell gems then I'd like to be able to do equivalent
damage to an NPC my level.

Seriously, other than getting that Bazaar implemented, getting rid of the
dot/lifetap exp loss in duals bug I'd like a more advance chat option (yes,
like mythic have done) with chat groups for friends (rumours that this was
going to be implemented long before DAoC but it never happened to my
knowledge) and guild chat between allied guilds.
