I'll admit to never having been there, but even if the shaman is
starting off by casting Togor's Insects (which is less slow than
Turgur's), expecting to have it resisted, and then immediately casts
Turgur's, it's going to take at least 5.25 seconds until the second
slow lands, which is pretty close to the recycle time on taunt (8
seconds IIRC), and in the more likely (I assume) event of the shaman
using Turgur's both times, it'll be 9 seconds, which is enough for
taunt to recycle. Forlorn Deeds is slightly faster, but still takes
8.25 seconds to recast.

All recast times from Lucy. Anyone who actually plays a 51+ shaman
please correct me if I'm wrong about the non-use of Togor's, my shaman
is only level 43.
