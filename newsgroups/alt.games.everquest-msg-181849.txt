SKs are very solo-able. I had a friend that used to solo all the time 
with a DE SK in Plane of Growth and this was before Luclin and AA and 
level 65. He was able to solo just about all the way from 1 to 60 
although he did group when he felt like it.

Monks, I don't know. I played one up to the 30s, but it is a bitch to 
solo effectively with one and you will definitely have to spend a bunch 
on bandages to even have a shot.
