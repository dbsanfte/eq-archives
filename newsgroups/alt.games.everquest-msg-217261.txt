The female NPC Iksar model is a bug that's been in since SoL went
live, as far as I know. It's been reported repeatedly and SOE isn't
even acknowledging it. *shrug* Anyway, aside from some of the
animations, the new Iksar look much better, IMO. The only Luclin
models I don't care too much for are the Erudites, and that's mainly
just for the peanut heads of doom look. ><

My only real complaint are the hair styles. Each race/gender seems to
have only 1 of 3 or 4 that looks good. And each race has at least one
that looks completely ridiculous. :p
