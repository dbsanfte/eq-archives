No, you would not call Sony.  Sony does not support transferring accounts.
As far as Sony is concerned, you are and will forever be the owner of the
account.

The best you can do is simply tell your friend the account name and
password.  Sony has no way (unless you tell them) of knowing that it is not
you playing.  You and the friend can also change the billing information so
that it is him paying.  I don't know if changing credit cards like that will
alert Sony and risk having them cancel the account, so to be safe, your
friend should use a game card to pay.

You should also warn your friend that because Sony doesn't consider accounts
transferable, *you* will always be able to go through the "I forgot my
account name/password" process and get it reset, so if you two ever stop
being friends, and have a nasty de-friending (uhm...what is the word for
friends that corresponds to "break up" for lovers?), you can screw him.  I'm
*NOT* saying you would ever do that, but the honorable thing to do is warn
your friend that the mechanism is there.  He needs to know exactly what he
is buying.
