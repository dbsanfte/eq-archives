The ASUS A7V333 is a very nice and quick motherboard to build a system
around. I just finished putting together a system for my father based on it,
though the sweet spot here for CPU's was Athlon 1800. Added to that was
512mb of good quality PC2100 memory and my old Geforce2 MX 32mb graphics
card.

To give an indication of performance, when playing a 600mb odd LoTR divx
through media player, he could cut to scenes halfway through with the slider
bar without it missing a single frame. My own Athlon 1.2GHz with 768mb of
PC133 chokes for a few seconds before starting to play from the new
location.

EQ still plays better on my machine though, soley due to a Geforce3 Ti 64mb
graphics card I strongly suspect. Now - my Geforce 3 in his
system...*drools*
