Sounds familiar...  at 14 my Surefall born Half elf ranger was having probs
gaining exp in Blackburrow, and WK was just tooo slow.  A friend told me to
goto Oasis, which I did... it was great, but...  It's a pain in the Ass
training at the ranger guild in Kithicor, too damn easy to die in that
forest when your an unsowed newbie as I was lol.  As your post specifically
asks for a place to hunt close to a Ranger guild, the best place I can think
of is North Karana. Ten mins run back to Surefall for training and new
spells etc.  You can be bound in the Gypsy camp right in the NK zone, so no
lengthy corpse runs, the griffons etc in NK after a little practice get easy
to avoid, and the Highland lions and Beetles there can bring in some lovely
exp, lot of wisps around too, to bring home some PP.  Also to note is the
griff boss Grimfeather is in that zone, so you can almost guarantee someone
will take him down at some point, and leave the Ranger Quest item Rune of
Ivy, for someone to loot on his corpse. (used in Ivy etched sleeves quest,
if I remember rightly).  Also, quick zone into WK and with a little help, or
again some kind soul shouting its rotting on his corpse, there is the Ghoul
messenger, which drops a map that can be traded in for the Short sword of
Morrin, a ranger only Magic weapon with stats, good item for a new player.
Once you get a few lvls in NK, you can still stay fairly close to your
Surefall base and hunt in East Karana, the excellent High pass and South
Karana at the aviaks.  I have followed this route with alts, ie my Half Elf
bard and Druid, worked really well for me.
