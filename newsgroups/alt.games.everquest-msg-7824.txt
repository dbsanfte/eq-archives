Well, after 32 levels of mediocre loot I finally lucked out! Prior to today
I've never even got to lose the roll on a forest loop. My guildies are
getting them right and left in WW -- none for me!  Hours in FM -- none for
me!

Tonight I dinged 32 and headed to Kurn's to work on my last skeleton finger.
Was probably there for about an hour killing boring green skellies. Another
monk comes by also looking for fingers and I agree to share, and he agrees
to let me have the 4" one if it drops. A third guy shows up a while later, I
guess wanting to camp the Jester. I don't really care either way since I
don't expect the Jester to show. A friend of mine camped for 14 hours
straight without seeing the bum. Guildmates have got him a few times - but
no club.

Anyhow, I'm going back and forth in the stable area killing skeletons. I
turn around and see a skeleton pop right on top of me.. and then realize it
says UNDEAD JESTER above it. Then I realize it's holding a club!  So, I
quickly kill it and loot the famed Iksar Beserker Club!!

WOO HOO!!

So, my net worth has gone up considerably. Not sure how much I'll get for
it, but a guildie said a price of 4K would get me a quick sale. I may go to
EC and try for more.

Wow.. I feel like I won the lottery! :-)

Big question.. should I spend it on gear for my monk and other chars.. or
put it towards a tinkerer's bag? Long term the tink bag will enable me to
make more money.. but I don't know how hard it would be for me to get one.
And, it seems nutty to spend so much $$ on one item! :-)

Anita

PS - EQ just sucks you in. It's silly that I'm this happy about getting a
silly club which I'll be able to sell for too much silly plat and buy more
silly stuff in game. :-)
