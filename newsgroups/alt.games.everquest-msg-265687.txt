That is also a content problem, if everyone thinks they need *one*
thing, and that *one* thing is only available in *one* place.

Or at least similar gear.

That is still insufficient content. In any event, "easier" can have
several definitions including fastest to get to, easiest to kill,
fastest spawning. And that also assumes similar gear can't just drop
from *regular* mobs a la D2 (and possibly WoW, though that isn't
clear).

Anyways if the harder mobs also have better rewards in another way,
then people are alternatively rewarded for going to those instead.

If you can control who is allowed to interact with you (directly *or*
indirectly), then immersiveness is no longer even a factor, it is
completely gone. You've gone into your pocket universe. The problem is
the way dungeons are set up in non-instances right now, with their
static spawns and set camping etc. Dungeons don't have to be set up
that way. If they were set up in a way to reward moving, you get none
of the supposed non-immersiveness some of the instancing proponents
here are suggesting. And there is *nothing* wrong with running into
another friendly (ie, non-mob) group in the dungeon. 

Now I will give you an example of instancing that actually works.
Dungeons? No. Cities? No. The best place for instancing is to simulate
large scale areas of countryside where you *wouldn't* expect to run
into people at all. In the perfect mmorpg (mine), instances would be
used to simulate medium distance worldy travel. Say, for example,
Ocean of Tears. Several birds killed with one stone. You make travel
meaningful, maintaining worldyness. You make travel interesting,
eliminating the tedium. And you give people a place where they can be
by themselves if they so desire, a place that it makes worldy *sense*
that they are by themseves. No pocket dimensions. No
non-interactivity. You can even have non-instanced zones only
connected through instances (the example I am thinking here is an
instanced stretch of desert like NRo and SRo (but bigger with more
interesting things of course, also they are separate instances) but
Oasis is not. So all the travellers through the desert will eventually
meet up in the Oasis, where you would expect them to.

THAT is the worldy view of instancing that makes sense. Not instanced
pocket dungeons no different than Diablo games with a graphical chat
lobby. *Integrated* instancing.
