My memory is simply "thank you for your support" delivered in a slightly 
odd cadence.  My teatotalling relatives up on the mountaintop in West VA 
really loved those commercials for some reason, I can still hear them 
saying that, in their WV accent but the B&J cadence.

They may well have had it wrong though, I heard them do it more than I 
heard the original commercials.

My wife and I have a rather odd habit of using quotes from movies, 
commercials, TV shows as shorthand to each other, I know I've said it 
that way a hundred times... which also doesn't guarantee I have it right.
