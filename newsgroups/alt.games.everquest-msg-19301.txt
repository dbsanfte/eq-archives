That was very brave and noble of you and all, but the rogue really
dropped the ball.  By level 3 a rogue is capable of a level of invisibility
everyone else in Norrath can only dream of.  By clicking Hide and
then adding Sneak, assuming both succede (and he gets confirmation
messages, unlike other hide/sneak capable characters) he becomes
utterly invisible to both living and undead mobs all over, with the
rare exception of certain mobs endowed with the ability to see
invisible.  Since he can drag a body without breaking sneak/hide,
the rogue could have recovered his body with absolutely no
risk to anyone.  Yes, his movement rate slows to a crawl, but
its a great tradeoff for utter safety, unless he has to do some
swimming.  Unlike caster invisibility (which would be perfectly
adequate for BB, as there isn't a mix of live and dead enemies)
"hide&sneak" doesn't fade out unpredictably, either.  I made
a level 1 halfling rogue and ran him out into TD to pull my
then 35th level cleric's body off an island filled with some very
angry level 45+ Raptors. No worries.
