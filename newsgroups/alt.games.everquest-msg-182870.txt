This is the norm in online games. Consider that they want you to keep
playing an paying your $ to them. If you want a more realistic game, try
diablo 2 hardcore or neverwinter nights with hard core rules. I wouldnt even
consider playing EQ hardcore. It would just be a matter of time till I went
linkdead and my character suicided itself in the 30 seconds.
