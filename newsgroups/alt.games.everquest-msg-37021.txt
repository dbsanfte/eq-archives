I had a piece of software a few months ago called EQ Server Status Checker
(or something along those lines) but when i gave up EQ I deleted the
software and I now want it back since I restarted EQ and I can't find the
damned software anywhere hehe

I got the link from Everlore but as usual I can't find the friggin article
in their millions of news posts :(

Can anyone help me out please?

As far as I'm aware there's at least 2 different checkers, one called ESC
(Everquest Server Checker) and then the 1 I'm looking for which lists which
servers are up, down, locked etc and even shows how many people are playing
at that time.

Thanks in advance all
