It is demographics, therefore get out and explore =).  I was in the same
boat as you all the way until level 30.  Then I had started realizing there
are ALOT of opportunities out there for lvl 1 all the way through 34.
Always wondering what I could do to make the pp that I see other levels
around me have, I finally bit the bullet and got out there and explored.  A
really nice spot that I had found was Lower Guk in Innothulle Swamp (or
Swamp of No Hope) by Oggok and Grobb.  Going down into the lower levels I
found out that there was an experience bonus in the Lower Guk part.  Aside
from that, you can easily make around 400pp - 600pp per night there.  Kill
Kill Kill Undead frogs and Heart Spiders.  They usually drop 2pp - 6pp per
corpse and the fine steel weapons sell for around 4pp - 9pp per weapon.
Another great thing, most of the MoBs drop low weight stackable items and
gems such as Ivory, Runes, Emeralds (or Jades).  Since they are low weight
(0.01 stones)  and sell from around 12pp for Ivory to 2pp - 3pp for a Rune.
(Words are worthless).  Destroy all the copper and silver, it only weights
you down.  After everything was sold and all monies converted to Platinum, I
 came out with a grand total of approximatly 847pp and 4 levels to boot in
one night.

Just get out there and search around =).  Track bears exclusively.  That's
great for levels 3 - 15 and almost into the 20s.  Doing this with my
Necromancer I went from level 5 to level 8 in one night and had made around
150pp.  HQ Bear Skins sell for 20pp - 40pp (when I did it).  Tailored the
others or sold them at my discretion.  Go on to sell at peak hours when it
is the most populated (depending upon the server) and sell sell sell.

The opportunities are not limited as far as I can see.  I have been to the
moon a couple of times but, prefer to remain on Norrath.  I'll save that
until level 40.  There are still alot of places to explore and alot of
opportunities in the game for me and there should be for you.  Mistmoore,
Unrest, Oasis, Cazic-Thulle, OverThere, Timorous Deep, Ocean of Tears, The
Hole. All hold alot of items, money and experience.  Just keep it up =).
