I can relate to this quest item.  I needed them for my Monk newbie armor
too.  The only place I found them was in N. Ro in the grass between the
desert and Freeport.  If I was hunting the ONE that would spawn it always
dropped ________ coyote pelt.  Finally I was just sitting close to the
Adventure's camp and a stupid coyote attacked me.  Then it would drop a
Coyote Pelt.  I tried hunting again and same results.  Sit back down and
bang attacked again.  That is how I got my 2 pelts.  Let them come to me.

I think I might have another one in my bank if you are on The Nameless
server.

Ben
