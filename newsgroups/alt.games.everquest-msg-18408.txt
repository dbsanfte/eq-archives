True, but since I myself have printed out almost every map
in eqatlas.com and put them in a binder, I can attest that
it's a long, tedious process that eats up a lot of paper
and expensive ink cartridges.  Plus of course it requires
a printer (a color printer to get best results), something
that not everyone has.

Rather than practically force every one of the 300,000+
Everquest subscribers to do this, wouldn't it make more
sense to have something in the game provide a little
navigational assistance so people don't have to slave
for many hours over a hot printer instead of actually
playing the game?
