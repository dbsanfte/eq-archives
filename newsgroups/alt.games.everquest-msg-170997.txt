My system has encountered a problem with running EQ lately.  I don't know
whether to blame a patch or not, but either way here's my problem.  I'll
sometimes zone into an area that I've never had problems in and it's worse
than the lag in the bazaar.  It doesn't happen to any particular zone, as
it's been happening anywhere, anytime.  Sometimes I'll be in a zone for
quite sometime and it just rears it's ugly head.  For example, I was in DL
soloing without a hitch.  I decided to go to FV and sell and once I hit the
area around where Veltar is, my system started bucking horribly with video
lag.  Some green trash drachnids started wailing on me, yet I couldn't even
come close to losing them even with level 52 selos.  The lag was too rotten
with the screen refreshing itself every 5 seconds or so.  It was awful.  I
thought I was going to die, but it actually got a tad better and I was able
to escape, though it was *very* close.  This started happening about 2 weeks
ago I figure.
It might not be just EQ.  I was playing NHL2002 on my system against my
brother on one of my other systems.  About 3 games into it, both systems
simply froze for about 30 seconds.  They froze at the same time and
corrected at the same time.  I can't rationalize my system's potential video
problems affecting another comp in that way, but computers kind of suck in
strange, mysterious ways.  This is the *only* time I've had a problem
outside of EQ.
Anyway, here are my system specs if anyone cares to toss a suggestion or two
my way.
AMD2100+
AsusA7V8X
64MB ddr GeForce2 GTS
Diamond Moster Sound II
1GB ddr ram (2700 I believe)
2 GB swap file, much hdd free
cable modem

All drivers are current.  I've set video to default as well as several other
settings.  I've tried disabling sound, yada-yada-yada....you get the
picture.  I'm pretty sure it's video-related, but you never know.

TIA for any advice,
SEAN...
