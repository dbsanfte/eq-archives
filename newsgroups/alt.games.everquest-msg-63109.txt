Ed--

You're a crybaby, logically inept, and have only given me more reasons
to presume your incompetence not only as a professional software
developer, but in basic cognitive skills with your continuing assault
on the rudiments of logic.

Let me assure you that I do not say anything here that I would not say
if you were close enough to punch me in the nose. The primary
difference is that, in RL, I would have flipped the bozo bit on you a
long time ago and the conversation never would have gotten this far.

Grow some skin, boy. If you couldn't take the mild criticism in my
original post, how are you going to survive when people are mean to
you?
