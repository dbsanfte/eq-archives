Does anyone know if you need the full version of Trillian in order to
use TEQIM because I downloaded and tried to install it, but was unable
to find where you install the *.dll as a plugin? This is what leads me
to believe that it is the case. I guess on the other hand its only $25
and I been meaning to buy it for a while now. Until then I think I'm
going to stick with using ole crash, bug prone EQIM.
