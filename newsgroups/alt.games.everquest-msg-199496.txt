He does make a point tho, just not the one he intended.  An INT caster
who groups at the Orc highway at 14 will quickly learn that over-nuking
and nuking untanked adds are both effective suicide methods.  Or, if
they're like Mr. Prue here they'll learn that they're not capable of
playing a caster without a crutch.  Either way it's an educational
experience for them and their group-mates.
