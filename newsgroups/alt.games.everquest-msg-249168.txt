Bullshit as we will soon see.

This is not a quote. This is either your poor understanding or
paraphrasing of what I said. To restore the context you have omitted,
either to obscure what was said or to build a strawman...

The first part is factual. The second part is a *possible* conclusion
as evidenced by my use of "might mean". For this to have been a
fallacy, I would have had to use it as a definate which 'proved' my
argument. I didn't do so, therefore your accusation is simply
incorrect. I used it as a possible piece of evidence, to be accepted
or rejected on its own merits.

Your poor understanding of logic and arguments is noted.

You are demonstrating a classic example of what happens when someone
who really doesn't understand logic or fallacies tries to throw out
latin like they do. I didn't omit any of those. It is up to you to
demonstrate their effect if you want them to support your argument.
Nice try at trying to shift the burden of proof, though.

Wrong again. Other than the wording you used, which is not what I
said, you are simply wrong in saying there's no real evidence either
way. I've given evidence my way - it is the only EQ related evidence
in existance. There is no evidence YOUR way. I'm sorry, but your
reasoning here is as flawed as your understanding of fallacies.

You still don't have any idea what people who understand what an rpg
is are talking about.
