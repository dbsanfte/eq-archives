Ah, caster's realm provides inaccurate data? Didn't know that, I referred to 
it quite a bit as a source for basic information on the various class spell 
lists. Never encountered any inaccuracies that I'm aware of, but then I 
didn't use them for anything more than 10,000 foot view lists of the spells. 
For anything specific there was always Lucy (which I wouldn't refer a new 
user to).
