Actually, loot always goes in the following order:

On your character, if you can use it and the slot is open;

Into a stack of like items, assuming it's stackable and you already
had one (or more) in inventory in a non-filled stack;

Into any non-filled inventory slot (items fill open inventory slots
before containers); and

Into the first inventory slot (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) that
is large enough to hold the item.

The "random" placement is a function of the size of the loot and
the bag (container) placement in your inventory.  My main's
inventory is filled, for instance, in this order:

Bootstrutters Framed Backpack (10% wt reduction, large items);
Large Soiled Bag (100% wt reduction, small items);
Rallic Pack (85% wt reduction, giant items);
Bag of Sewn Evil Eye (70% wt reduction, large items);
Light Burlap Sack (65% wt reduction, large items);
Lionhide Backpack (35% wt reduction, large items);
Archeologist Pack (25% wt reduction, large items); and
JBoots -or- Herbalist Pack (25% wt reduction, large items.)

The Bootstrutters Framed Backpack holds food, potions,
reagents, etc and is always full.  Words, gems, etc get put
in the large soiled bag and the bigger items (weapons, etc)
get put in the Rallic Pack.  Since I normally master loot (cleric,
almost always in guild groups) I periodically check the items and
move light items from the first items into the containers with lesser
weight reduction.  I've actually filled up my inventory a couple of
times that way without becoming encumbered...

At some point I guess I'll have to break down and buy a Bag of the
Tinkerers (100% wt reduction, giant items) and retire one of the
lesser bags to an alt.
