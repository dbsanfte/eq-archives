You can't get a health report from a charmed mob and as for the other
commands, they really don't come into play for solo charming.  Send in
the pet and if its still alive and charmed at end of fight park it to
prepare for killing it is all I've really had a use for.

Again probably more useful in a grouping situation than solo.  I tend to
try for the toughest pet I can charm so that hopefully its alive at the
end of the fight with low hp and ripe for me to camo and dd in one shot
for the bonus exp.
