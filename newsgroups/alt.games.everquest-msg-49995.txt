Well, I finally found a reason to visit Ak'anon with someone other than an
exploratory mule.  Seems I need a dose of the Regurgatonic to feed to a
certain critter who lives not too far from Qeynos.....

Problem is, my character is a Qeynosian human, and most of the Gnomes con
apprehensive to me.  Ergo, no Regurgatonic....at least not yet.

My question is this... what's would be the best quest to quickly gain
faction with the Gemchoppers in Ak'anon, so I can get my Regurgatonic?

I'm hoping gaining faction in Ak'anon isn't as big a pain as trying to gain
faction in Erudin.....
