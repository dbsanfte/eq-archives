 Ah ok. I'm not sure Gate would be considered a 'same-zone evac-type
spell' so it doesn't sound like that should cause you to reload. Going
by the wording they used it sounds like it only applies to Succor or
Egress. I was recently Succored across Sirens Grotto post-patch (over
the weekend) and it did cause a reload.

 As far as #2 goes, since you didn't have a key you don't move so there
is no requirement for your current zone to reload.
