This "just the mechanics" talk makes all my PC games sound so sterile, like
some indistinguishable console titles with throwaway jewel case inserts and
whose only expressions are flashing electrons. PC Games are more than a
bunch of bits on a screen, they're part of a multimedia entertainment
package that have historically included a rich variety of components,
including the interactive piece and the presentation components (boxes,
artwork, soundtrack CDs, manuals, action figures, and so on). That's why
we've had these neat boxes over the years, and that's why Gone Gold has a
lift test. Business realities being what they are, this element of the
presentation has now faded into utilitarianism, and a good manual is one of
the last remnants of this thinking, where you can still get a good backstory
and extra entertainment for your game dollar. Like a DVD that includes extra
supplemental material unnecessary to anyone from a "mechanics" standpoint,
the extra entertainment derived from these other components isn't just for
the hardcore, it's just as entertaining for the casual user (whether they
carry it around or not). I submit that it is you guys who want "just the
mechanics", and are willing to print PDF files when necessary, who are the
hardcore. The rest of the gaming public still enjoys a good read and a good
manual can certainly be part of that experience. Publishers, of course, will
play up your preference and call it market demand, so I have no illusions
about the direction the industry is now taking ...
