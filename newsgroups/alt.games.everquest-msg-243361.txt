Yes.  But I think you're missing the point here.

I have no problem with another "legit" player killing a mob and thus
denying me the opportunity to kill that same mob.  I DO have a problem
with a plat seller doing the same thing.

Yes, I know the outcome is the same in both cases.  It's the *intent*
that matters.
