*grin* I felt a little bad for him, since it took longer than
expected, but hey, he still got exp for the pixies and quite a bit of
free PL in addition to the sword and bag :)

Last night I finally made my eggnog, listened to complaints about
missing the dwarven Santa in GFay, watched the snow, set my druid's
hair and eyes, tried out the newfangled socials (they were right about
/dance having to be seen to be believed!), and then helped with CR for
a level 56 guild cleric who'd been bound and camped at fire giants
after a Naggy raid... Fortunately, he managed to run into Naggy and
get banished after 3 deaths, so when our 2 bard, ench, sk, druid,
cleric group didn't manage to clear all the FGs, we rezzed the three
extra casualties and summoned the three clerical corpses. 
The SK wondered if I had ulterior motives in handing him spiked eggnog
(I warned him not to drink it right away, but did he listen?)
