Sorry if this has been posted already... I've been away for a week (at 
E3, in fact, but unfortunately I didn't get to see EQII, as SOE is 
always an invitation-only stand :( ) and a mountain of work prevents me 
from going through last week's posts.

Anyway, Robert X. Cringely has a couple of columns on the sale of 
virtual goods. He's as sharp as always on the reasons why Sony will not 
actually take action, but unfortunately, he doesn't play EQ and his 
proposed solution to online scamming is unworkable for reasons obvious 
to anybody who has.

Here's the link to the most recent column:
