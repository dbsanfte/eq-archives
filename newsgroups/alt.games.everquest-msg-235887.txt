What have you done for newbies
 lately?

I grouped my Shaman with a Necro in OT near the POK stone.  I was level 20
and he was level 16.  He summoned he pet and I buffed it.  Then I started
pulling stuff to his pet and then letting his pet tank.  Funny thing was his
pet was kept getting the crap beat out of it and soon was destroyed.  I did
not think much of it and he summoned another.  Same thing happened again.
When I questioned him about his pets he said that he still only had the
level 8 pet because he did not know where he could get the upgraded one for
his level.  WTF?  He had to quit for the afternoon and I told him I would
group with him that evening if he went and got his upgraded pet spell.
Before we departed I asked him about if he was using Fear.  He did not know
what the heck I was talking about.  I explained to him that he needed to get
his upgraded pet and his fear spell so that he could fear kite stuff.  After
explaining this he was left with the impression that I was the Yoda of EQ.
Bah, I am nowhere near that but it was still very cool to have someone
listen as tentatively as he did and sure enough, that evening when I came
back online we grouped in OT and had a blast.  A 16th level Bard joined us
whose main is a cleric on another server.  She said she got tired of sitting
on her butt all the time so she came to stromm and made a bard.  Between us
three we pulled and killed non stop for over three hours.  I say none stop
but there were a few one minute pauses just so I could medd enough for a DOT
or a heal.  One time necro almost died and would have if not for a Root I
cast.  But a very enjoyable evening that I know the newbie enjoyed.  All of
us dinged during that time.  In fact the last 15 minutes I tanked because I
was totally out of mana and we needed to ding the necro.

Same day as all of that I took a 22 necro guildie on a journey through
Warsliks Woods to the Forest Giant fort.  He had never been there before.
He thought is was the funniest thing seeing a gnome necro and a froggie
shaman killing big tall forest giants.

I have my own beliefs about the new server.  It is by no means a newbie.  It
is a place where UBERs can compete with one another to see who is SUPER UBER
UBER UBER UBER.
