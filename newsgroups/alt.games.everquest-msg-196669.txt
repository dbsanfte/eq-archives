You still can't get it through your thick skull that I started by
asking WHY bards had to twist songs "the hard way".  A legitimate
curiosity.  A legitate question.  Your response was abusive.  And
thus, another argument is born.

You'll notice there are other responses in this thread that disagree
with me, but do it without being abusive or insulting.  I can only
chaulk up your predictable abusiveness to immaturity.

Re-read my original question.  I asked WHY bards had to twist "the
hard way", I didn't say it was stupid.

Of course, your abusive response elicited a response in me I'm not
proud of.  I shouldn't have claimed it was stupid.  Instead of
taking your trollish bait, I should have ignored you, and asked
my question again if nobody else answered (thankfully, Sean did,
and he provided some interesting insight without being abusive).

That being said, please, kaev, do me, yourself, and everyone else
in a.g.e a favor: if you see me post, don't respond to it, ever.
You just can't seem to do it without being abusive, and it ends
up being a flamefest.  In fact, automate the process, so you're
not even tempted.  Plonk me.  Please.  It'll help you resist the
knee-jerk reaction to respond with insults.
