In addition to the skill caps that Archerbear listed for you, it appears that
bards are on a different defensive table from the other "plate" classes, the
same complaint clerics have; our "plate" is about the same mitigation as
ranger's chain, if not monk's leathers.

Bards melee output is also sadly lacking; yes they can dual weild, but they
can't double attack, and they can't use two handers.  They also get damage
bonus for their primary hand weapon, which of course clerics don't.  This
means they do outdamage cleric's in melee by a bit, but warriors paladins and
shadowknights put them to shame, and you don't really think of those as damage
classes.  When clerics get their 56+ summoned hammers you may well find the
cleric outdamaging the bard, because that series of weapons is specifically
designed to make up for lack of double attack/dual weild.

So you have a class that does crappy damage and gets hit hard and often while
having a low HP total... bard as sole melee in a melee/healer team is one
expensive way to kill things; at least while the ranger is taking a severe
beating he's handing a severe beating back, so the mob dies faster than he
would with a warrior as sole melee.

Bard slow is fairly reliable, if you know slow is important then when you get
interrupted you drop some -other- song in the twist and repeat the slow, thats
all.  Trouble with it is its a pretty crappy one till you are quite high
level, its generally the "well its better than no slow at all" class of slow.
It doesn't seem to slow enough to make up for the other bard melee problems.

One nice thing about bard as sole melee is that he'll actually have a decent
haste; bard haste is pretty crappy for his group, but he also has a self only
line that's in there with shaman/chanter hastes, a much better boost than his
group one.  This won't make up for his lack of double attack though
