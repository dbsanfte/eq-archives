Hehe or if you want to keep dry, you can go into the double building near
the
bank and take the tunnel to the same spot. That is the way I go also. The
stream
is getting to be more dangerous every day. I ran into an Iksar Necro and his
pet
standing in the stream. Some other players have told me he is over 40th lvl.
He
has a poison spell that killed me 5 minutes AFTER I zoned into ill omen. I
didnt
even see him when it hit me, and had 40 + lvl SOW on. Ran right past him and
he nailed me. (checked my rear-view mirror F9 and saw what it was chasing me
before I zoned.
