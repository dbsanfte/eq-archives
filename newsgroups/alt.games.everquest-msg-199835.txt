That would mean going back to Innoruuk. It has some great people, but
it is old, has never split, and the mudflation level is insane. There
are no true newbies or lowbies on Inny. You see more super-twinks and
alts being PL'd than normal exp groups.
 

I might start a new Enchanter on another server though. How is Stromm?
