I -said- begrudgingly.  And Cheal is a fairly efficient way to get the 
necros' hp back to full.

Are you sure?  So far I haven't encountered the "tough choice" situation 
of which useful buffs to eliminate, other than having to pester a cleric 
for a virtue because I'd rather have the extra slot than have Bo9 plus 
Kazad.

Graphic?  Damn you SOE, I said no more helm graphics until you get 
someone who can draw a decent helm!

However, I'm just saying berserker weapon skills (all three of them) cap 
out lower than 250.  Does failure to move at least 2hs up to 250 mean 
that they dont think we are a DPS class?  If we aren't, then what the 
hell are we... which is the question I've been askin since before making 
a zerker of my own.

Well they already have "soulbound on pickup", which is simply no drop.

I don't see the point of "soulbound on equip" even if WOW does have it, 
I mean, it doesn't make me say "oh, well I'll stick with EQ then, I was 
going to switch because WOW has soulbound on equip..."

We can only hope!

Maybe they forgot to put only 65-70 content in, and included stuff for 
the majority of players, instead (you know, that 30-50 crowd which even 
my alts are too high to be part of, but still...)
