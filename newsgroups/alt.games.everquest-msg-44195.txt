Thanks for all the advice guys!.I did play the tutorial but the memory is
not what
it used to be,all that contaminated beef ;o)  .
I'm not sure whether to pursue my Warrior Character(lev4).Or carry on with
my
Paladin(lev3).I like the idea of having a few spells.The Paladin does seem
to level slower
than the Warrior.Well,I go under the name of Doiel and I'm around
Freeport,so
if you see me,and you have some spare armour or a nice sword that would come
in
handy.See you around maybe.
