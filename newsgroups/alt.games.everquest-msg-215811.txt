First, make a new character.  If you need advice then a wizard isn't the
right class; its the one thats most reliant on either twinking or outside
help; you'll have to group up thru all of your 20s just because you take
hits like any other "int caster" but have no SOW, no snare, no pet to
hold off the mobs.  Once you get snare you can solo if you like, but even
then tough without a SOW or JBoots or something.  If none of what I'm
saying was patently obvious when you selected wizard, then you probably
need to rethink the descision.

Froglok, too, is a choice I'd think long and hard over; they don't seem
to have any advantage at all over all the other wizard races, while most
races feature one thing or another that makes them shine (or at least
glimmer); better stats, hide ability, advantageous starting quests,
something.  Perhaps thats less true of wizards specifically, but in
general the only good thing about frogloks that I've been able to find is
that they do a backflip when casting a spell.  I imagine that gets tired
after 4 or 5 levels though, leaving you wondering why you went frog for
the next 61 levels and beyond (life begins at 65 some say, and I know
plenty of people who've spent more time at that level than in their whole
1 to 65 run up the leveling ramp)

Waiting for EQ2 also strikes me as odd.  I personally have yet to see
anything exciting about the game, and I have lots of time invested in
learning the ins and outs of EQ1; not only would I be giving up
experienced characters (not really  hardship, I like starting new ones)
and loot (thats tougher, but I'm doing it on my current character, who's
on a different server than my others) but I'd be giving up personal
experience, and my friends who decided to stay with EQ1.

But trust me on the sunscreen.
