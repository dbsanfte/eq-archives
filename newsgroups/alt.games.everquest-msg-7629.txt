Stan...my apologies to being so gruff about this subject. I had to deal with
Avengers little lies for close to two months on this subject and of course
seeing from his replies to you, he's lying again. I posted about 40 sources
to prove he was full of shit and he couldn't post one to back up his claims.
Your info comes pretty close to support what you think and I can totally
understand your state of mind, but you have to trust me on this. It wasn't
the norm for American pilots to take any type of drugs during WWII and they
sure as hell weren't prescribed to them.

The original debate began when Avenger claimed that they were all junkies
addicted to speed and when I went to research it, I fully expected to find
that there was a good percentage that were...just not as many as he claimed.
What I found instead was misinformation regarding this matter. I could find
no references to American pilots using the drug and until your link today
from Mr. Atkins I had never even seen it referenced. I've had the privelage
to discuss it in a NG with a couple of WWII veteran pilots who explained to
me that it was not only false but it was unheard of for American Pilots.
