    That works even worse than what they proposed, as it depends strongly on
order. Let's use his example, two cheap sellables (Goblin Bones), and a
magic item. If I say "roll the Goblin Bones first", how many people will
start to complain? They don't want to win the bones and be shut out of the
magic item roll, but they also don't want to pass on the bones, lose the
magic item roll, and get nothing. In this case, it's easy to decide rolling
order. But get a few magic items, and order becomes much more difficult to
do "fairly" based on how much different party members value different items.
That's why I always insist on a "winner choice" system, because it
eliminates the BS.
