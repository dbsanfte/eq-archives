My fellow necro, you need to Educate your guild. Explain to them exactly 
what the cost was for that gem, and demand volunteers the next time you 
need to use your gems. Surely if everyone in your guild gave you a gem- 
just one- it wouldn't cost them very much, and it would greatly enhance 
your strength as a guild.
