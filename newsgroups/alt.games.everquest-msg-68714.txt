First, you are incorrect to imply that the melee your same level would live
through something like that, as well. Second, you still have some ability to
snare-root and move off to bind. At most the melee's only option is to run
for hit and hope that a mob that can run faster them him gets hung on some
pathing issue.
Third, the arguement about casters being more powerful in general then melee
classes with the exception to end-game encounters is true. You will never see
a melee quad-kiting blues. You will never see 6 melees in a group dropping
35+ mobs at one time.
