    Ben has given a response to this. He's pointed out that the spellbook
used to last until level 50 (pre-Kunark), and that nobody complained when
that was reduced to level 35. Back when you could only be level 50 it wasn't
a "rite of passage", it was just a pain. Now Verant has decided there's no
reason for it to just be a pain until 35, either.

    At one point in an earlier post you stated that you didn't like how the
game "just changed" when you hit level 11. But apparently you have no
problem with the game "just changing" when a caster hits level 35, if you
believe that having the book makes things much harder. /target Jakugg,
/poke. :-)

    It's an artificial accomplishment. It's not a bonus, it's the removal of
a penalty. Punish them less and all that. Yes, I will concede now that other
benefits could be looked at as "penalties" when they aren't in effect, but
really - not being able to see the game?!?

    I don't know that you want to hear this, but from the changes on Test
that, too, will change. Nek Forest is changed to be a 1-20 zone, with the
spawns being more "packed together" so that people don't have to cross half
the zone from Neriak zone to find mobs that are above level 2. That means
people will be learning in the newbie zones. That also means that zones like
Lavastorm and Najena can be upgraded to meet the needs of players who will
be level 20 when they leave Nek Forest. That also means more new content,
like quests and tradeskill items, are being put in for low levels. This is
REALLY win-win here.

    Is it because it's hard, or is it because they work a long time in a
hell level for no gain? Were I a Verant employee, I'd say something along
the lines of: "The time vs. reward for hell levels was out of balance with
the time vs. reward of the levels immediately following hell levels. We have
rebalanced the time required accordingly." And you've heard my argument
about how now casters will require more XP to advance through the levels
just before new spells, making them weaker in the greater scheme of things.
My necromancer just got 29, and 28 was a pain. When only two levels of pet
that you can summon are blue, and you need to kill blues to advance, and
your DoTs date back to levels 12 and 16... I nuked a lot. :-)

    The degree of darkness in the game HAS been lessened, as a matter of
fact, since release. You remember the patch a few months ago, just before
SoL IIRC, that changed gamma settings, right? My Erudite necro can now see
in places like Tox at night without Deadeye - she saw almost nothing before
that. The standard seems pretty simple: is a gameplay "feature" so obnoxious
that rational gamers would stop playing because of it? Given the number of
people that have posted about "never, ever playing a nightblind race again"
I'd say changing it so a nightblind character wasn't as, well, nightblind
was a good thing. Especially since the time these characters are MOST LIKELY
to be without a light source is on CR.

    So where's the item I can hold that gets rid of the spellbook pre-35? I
hate being "bookblind". :-)

    He wouldn't be the only one. How many humans do YOU see running around
that aren't older characters? Barbarians that aren't twink rogues? Erudites?
Compare that with elves.

    So do you think that those three changes will allow dumber people to be
successful at a game that can already be mastered by people 14 years old?
The buddy that got me into EQ once had an eight year old come into his comic
shop, and when he saw my buddy playing EQ said "I play that game! My
character can fly!" He'd levelled his druid up to the point where he got
Levitate. An interesting post on a messageboard for one of my server's
top-tier guilds was from someone with a 51 cleric and a 57 shaman who wanted
to join them. He could be on a lot, except when he had his grade 9 varsity
football practices or games. This is the SAME cleric I once saw /auctioning
for a husband in EC, saying he was "polite and quiet". The bar's already on
the floor, you'd need to dig a basement for it to go any lower.

    I don't think we're seeing a trend so much as a major, final
"rebalancing". That's what the whole class balancing process was supposed to
be in the first place: one big "there you go, now you're balanced, STFU
about your class!" The changes to the lower level game seem, to me, to be
based around three things: accomodating changes to the upper-end game
without restricting the low-end game, lessons learned from DAoC, and adding
content for new players where before there wasn't much. I can see why
someone would worry about it being a trend, but I wouldn't complain until
the trend becomes reality. Why waste time complaining about what might
happen when there's still stuff to be fixed that is whineworthy? :-)

    It could very well be that the new Live team consists of the people who
never wanted the book in the first place, and who were forced to compromise
with the hard-core Visionists that didn't want it gone or even wanted it to
be more restrictive (remember the "no tells" quote, too?) I'm sure the Live
team is partially listening to player input here, but I think at the root of
it has to be some belief by the people in charge that the book is stupid. If
they didn't think that, if they thought it served a purpose, I doubt they'd
change it. There's so many complaints out there that I'm sure they could
find ones that they agreed needed to be dealt with that they could do first
before the book.

    Good luck, Jakugg. 59 is the hell to end all hells. Just ask the people
in my guild who keep falling back into it (they get greedy for the AA points
and don't pad 60 enough). Last night was REALLY bad for that - after the LD
issue that knocked four servers, including mine, offline just as we were
pulling Entariz and another WW dragon, we came back and ressed. But none of
my resses, or the click stick resses the other two clerics gave, gave back
any XP. Um, whoops.
