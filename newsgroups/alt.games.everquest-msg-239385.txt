Assuming that you're talking about the druid epic, it can be easily
duo'd these days. We did everything but Feydedar with no more than 3
people right after PoP came out, 65SK, 63 shaman and 60 druid (added a
rogue to get to the Jade Reavers) and the fights were pretty trivial.
Would've loved to try to duo Fey but it wasn't worth potentially
screwing up a friend's epic so we brought a full group.
