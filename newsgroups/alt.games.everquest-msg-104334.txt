LOL... every major company that cares about the popularity of their 
product among consumers employs Psychologists.  It's called market 
research.

Every time I walk in to Best Buy I have a near uncontrollable urge to 
buy... heh, stuff, and a lot of it.  I've talked to a lot of people who 
get those same feelings.  There's no arguing with the effectiveness of 
consumer psychology.

Addiction, especially mental addiction, is a weak person's excuse.
