Long time lurker here. I think SOE put KEI in the game to speed up
game play in the hopes of moving folks up in level faster to populate
the newer zones or the higher level underpopulated ones. I love KEI
myself since it allows me to do more in a shorter amount of time and
since I don't play much, I can still gain nice amounts of XP. I also
find myself taking a few more chances with a larger mana pool at my
finger tips.

I don't have to have KEI and often I don't have it if money is short
but usually I need to relocate to a less difficult area to hunt.

KEI is a real plus but its just a plus, not necessary to game play.
