I understand that the delay of a weapon is the time it takes in seconds to
swing again, ie 31 delay mean 3.1 second delay time. But what I would love
to find out from you all is the equation that EQ uses to determine how much
damage is caused by a weapon.

Example, I love using my Dwarven Sap. It's a 8 22 weapon (if I remember
correctly) and I consistently do 15-25 pts damage with it in my primary
hand. Skill in 1hb is around 180 at this time...  How is my damage
calculated by the computer? Just curious, thanks..

Part II

I have also noticed recently that when I get a crit or a crip type blow that
the actual damage I do is about 4 points higher than the original value in
the (  )  that the computer told me I struck for. Anyone know why this is?

Thanks!
