I understand the extended warranties are bunk - what really gets me is
how deceptive the salespeople are willing to be to sell them. They
won't get me but I bet they get a lot of little old ladies and the
like. It makes for a bad neighborhood.

Don't get me wrong, I've run into a lot of nice, honest people at Best
Buy - I just don't get the feeling that management really rewards them
as much as the fuckwads.

www.bestbuysux.com reflects my personal experience as a customer
there.
