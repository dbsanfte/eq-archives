The latter part of this statement is one I want to take issue with. 
My disclaimer here is that I don't play a melee, so I am not confident
that I am correct.

It was my understanding that the amount of melee "hate" you generate
is only related to the amount of damage you do.  The more damage you
inflict, the more hate you generate.  Hate decays over time, but over
the course of a battle with multiple ticks, it's my belief that 2
weapons with identical DPS would generate the same amount of hate. 
Please disregard weapon procs for the purpose of this discussion.

However, according to what you just said, I am wrong.  You are saying
that of the 2 weapons with the same DPS, the one that hits faster will
cause more hate.  Over the course of a single tick, I would agree -
but over the course of 10+ ticks, I would think the two weapons would
generate the same hate.  Could it be that the act of engaging in a
round of melee generates hate, in addition to what is generated by the
amount of damage inflicted?

Could someone please clarify?  I would like to see some good arguments
as to *why*, and not necessarily conjecture.  I think this is a pretty
important issue, particularly for monks.  I see a lot of monks switch
to 2hb to generate less hate, so either the 2hb has less DPS than what
a monk typically uses, or I'm just flat out wrong.

And again, please disregard weapon procs, which changes the whole
aggro management game.
