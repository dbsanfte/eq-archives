CiH? hmmmm who is that? CiH...ah yes once long ago i knew a guild called
that on my server. i even know some poeple that have been  members there
that i called friends. i got so fed up by their
tactics/deeds/behaviour/rumored zone crashing and gm connections (i really
dont want to list all i have wittnessed and got told by reliable RL sources.
the list would be REALLY long) that i did the only thing i could do. i began
to ignore them. they are not there, invisible, thin air.
(sorry for some members that i called friends. but people joining a
community and benefiting from it, have to accept the fact that the
reputation of that community reflects on every single member. they see and
hear what happens but choose to stay and thus verify and accept that
behaviour thus stand for it).

this solution came to my mind when i had to read on the flame boards, how an
officer of that no longer for me existing guild announced:

the time of our members is more valuable as the time of all others;

connected with repeated posts from different members of that guild stating:

all but us are n00bz cus we gankin da uba phat lewtz mobz and u r not and we
bet u in a duel cus we roxxor!
(6 year old mentality which is only expected from a grown up if he has the
IQ of a doorknob. sadly its combined with the social abilities of a skunk
:p);

believe me, my life on drinal is much better now )))))

well i have to endure trains out of nowhere from time to time when a non
existing member of a non existing guild has non existing fun training the
hell out of camping peeps. e.g. with 10 hobgobbos while going from pon zone
in to the hedge without warning. (some poeple dont learn and ask in /ooc
please stop that training or at least warn please. answer: no we wont u
frikkin noob. if u cant handle the zone leave it)
