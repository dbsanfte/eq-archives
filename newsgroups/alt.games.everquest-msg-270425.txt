Well, that was beyond their control. But I can think of several times
during beta, especially open, where the servers were pretty much
unavailable for an entire day or more at a time. There were times even
during closed beta where they were crashing regularly and lagged to
hell when they were up. Yes, it was beta and all, but it just goes to
show that they're not perfect, either.
