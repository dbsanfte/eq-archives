Clan X may be a very good guild, and they may have a good grasp on what
makes guilds what they are... but for me, I'm playing a game.  I don't take
it quite that seriously.  If I have to start spending time I could be using
to fight monsters and roleplay in the world of Norrath attending meetings
about how we can make our guild the "ideal" guild, then it's not ideal
anymore.  I don't want this game to be a science, or a successful
"business", or a popularity contest.  I want it to be a world I can go to
have fun when I'm tired of doing useful things.  So... have fun with your
charts and graphs and powerpoint presentations but I'll pass, thank you very
much.
