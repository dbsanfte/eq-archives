By tipping even where you don't expect to come back to, and generally 
expecting for people to tip at the restaurants you do eat at regularly 
even if *they* aren't planning to come back, you keep the waiters happy 
and the service smooth at both places. This form of "selfish altruism" 
has evolutive advantages. Put in the most crude terms possible, if you 
make the world a better place, those who carry your genetic material 
will benefit.

Of course, if you are a total, utter selfish bastard, those who carry 
your genetic material will benefit too, but a society constituted 
entirely of bastards wouldn't last long, while a society constituted 
largely of altruistic individuals can support a *small* number of 
bastards. In fact, experiments with chimps have shown that the drive to 
punish cheats and free-loaders is biological as well, as they cannot be 
allowed to be *too* successful, or society would collapse.

So, yeah, on the whole I would agree that tipping is, fundamentally, a 
moral issue. See the opening sequence of "Reservoir Dogs" for further 
elaboration.
