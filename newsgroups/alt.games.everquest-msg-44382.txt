It has been only last in month I have got from 28 upto 40, did this from 28
to 31 in LoIo  (no exp bonus anymore, according to verants site)  I was just
sitting by the shore line rooting and dotting anything that past me, never
had to run, or died etc and exp was flying : )    At 31 I went to the FM
ledge at over there, solo all the way.. apart from a bit of grouping in
lvl35, I thought It might speed it up, but not really...  Took this exact
same route with my Ranger a few months ago....damn easy, not as fast as
going to High pass... but pretty good all the same.
