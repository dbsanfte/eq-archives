Best Buy in Chicago let me exchange a copy of PoP for a different one on 
the grounds that it had already had the seal broken on it.  They took my 
word for it, since I could easily have broken the seal myself.  I was 
rather pleased they did that.

I do wish I'd thought to copy down the serial number myself before I 
returned it... Oh well. :)
