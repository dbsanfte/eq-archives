It's still under NDA so anyone in Beta 4 couldn't tell you whether
that's horseshit or not without breaking the aforementioned NDA.

It'll no doubt have problems at launch as every MMO has since UO.
Compared to the problems EQ/ EQ2/SWG/AO/WoW had on day one (and which
Blizzard will have all over again  with their first expansion)
anything remotely playable and stable will be a huge success in
comparison.
