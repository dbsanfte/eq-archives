I play on an IBM Thinkpad T20. P-III 700, 256MB RAM, DVD drive. It has an S3
Savage/IX video chip with 8MB RAM and CrystalFusion sound. I get decent
frame rates (a little discoloration of distant landscapes makes the ground
look like it snowed until you get closer to it) and choppy music. But it's
very playable.
