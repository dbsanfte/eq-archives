Online transactions with a credit card are signifiacantly safer than any
other type of credit card transaction. Chances are that if you are like most
you will use your credit card at least several times a week , and each of
those times the full information to use your card will be available to
whomever you used your card with. For online transactions there is usually
no chance for a dishonest person to see the numbers , it is mostly handled
electronically.

What you should do is contact your credit card company and in writing put
all bogus charges in dispute. You can also fill out an identity theft report
with your local police . You should pull a copy of all 3 of your credit
reports to make sure no other shenanigans are going on .

To put things in perspective realize that over 90% of the people who die in
america from car crashes had eaten french fries in the last week . Using
your reasoning you could reduce your risk substantially if you forever more
swore off eating french fries.
