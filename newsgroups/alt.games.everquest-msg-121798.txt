Gotta consider how many on the server, how many of them happen to see
it, and how many of them happen to pay enough attention to it to say
"Hey, I know who that is...".

40k people even KNOWING a name out of 400k is enough to consider it
"obscure"... and having heard of a person doesn't really mean they
know who the person is, either.
