The cost of making it was what I was referring to, didn't mean to infer 
that I thought shamans (shamen/shaman/shamii) were charging too much - I 
actually looked into the cost of some components when I was levelling a 
shaman ages ago (she got to level 19 and was abandoned, so... no ;p), so 
I know how insanely pricey ingredients can be.  10pp per shrink is much 
too costly for me to afford just for frivolity's sake, considering that 
I've started using sow potions quite regularly on two characters (and 
thank god for generous guild shamans on *that*).  I just don't 
understand why they made such a fairly low-use spell (I mean, besides 
making it easier for ogres to fight in dungeons without arousing the 
hatred of *every* other player in there) so expensive to bottle.  To me, 
it'd make more sense for sow to be more expensive.

Ah well, one day, when I'm rich as Ben and have money to throw around on 
horses and bra--errr girdles, I'll drown myself in shrink potions.
