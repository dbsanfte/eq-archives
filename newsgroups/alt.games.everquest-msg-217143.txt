It depends.  In this case, I'd say Cleric makes the decision.

In general, there are a couple of factors.  Let's consider the general case
here, rather than just LDoN.

1. The Cleric is the one who knows (or should know) whether they have enough
mana to keep everyone alive for the fight.

2. However, there may be other factors, such as ease of recovery.  For
example, in many places, recovery will be faster if you have everyone dead
at the place you want to be, rather than half the party dead there, and half
the party alive at the zone in.  In fact, recovery from everyone dead deep
in might be faster than recovery from the whole party alive at the zone in.
(LDoN's lack of repops make it hard for this to happen there, though).

What I do as a Wizard is *ask* at the start of a raid who calls evac.
Generally, it is the raid leader.  If a Cleric sees that they don't have
enough to keep everyone alive, they tell the raid leader, and he makes
a decision.  Sometimes the raid leader will name the Cleric or the Enchanter
and say that they too can call evac.

In your situation, where you don't have the recovery issues, it is basically
going to come down to whether or not the Cleric has enough mana to let the
group finish the fight, so might as well just go directly off the Cleric's
call, rather than going through the group leader.
