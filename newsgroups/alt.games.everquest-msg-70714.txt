AHHH Evil person, top replying! Your quoting of my message has been banished
to the depths of hell from whence it came!

Yes they could probably patch different servers at different times but its
probably not all that desirable. To give an example of why not, lets
consider the stupid amounts of XP that AoE groups were getting in (a zone
whos name ive forgotten) just after SoL was released.
Can you imagine if they patched that zone on all but a few servers. The
people that live on the servers that got patched would be crying foul until
they were blue in the face.
The people that were on servers that didnt get patched would simply point
their fingers at the others and laugh while they continued to rake in stupid
amounts of XP.

Having said that, you could also argue about only patching 'bugs' and not
content/design issues but then you open up a whole other can of worms
drawing the line between whats a 'bug' and whats a content/design issue.

All in all yes I would like to see staggered patches on the servers but I
can appreciate why it isnt so. Man what a nightmare it would be to manage
that!
