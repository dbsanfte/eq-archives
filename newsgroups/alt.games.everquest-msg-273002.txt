If they did do so, they did so illegaly.  They probably were rarely, if 
ever, prosecuted for it, but, it was still illegal.

The civil rights laws were passed in attempt to make treatment of people 
equal under the law regardless of various differences.  They were not 
passed to keep people from being jailed for no reason at all.

time for doing so.

Yes, it did indeed happen, and even at the time it happened, it was
