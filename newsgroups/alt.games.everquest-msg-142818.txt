A significant fraction of our population already does the absolute bare
minimum for survival. We call these people the poor. Is it any wonder that
people are so easy to discourage? It is a 1000 times easier to curtail an
achiever than it is to force a non achiever to become one. If all you care
about is equality of results you go the path of least resistance. We where
never intended to have equality of results , we where intended to have
equality of oppurtunity as far as was practible.

Every time you try and slice the pie more evenly you instead just shrink the
pie.
