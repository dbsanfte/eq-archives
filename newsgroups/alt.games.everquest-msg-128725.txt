Ok, luclin lags me a bit, but I want to explore it anyway.  Couple things
I'm looking for:  One, where should I hunt to solo, and where should I hunt
to group?

I'm a 53 Shaman, non-epic (hopefully in the next couple weeks, only the hole
and last part of CoM to do).

Next, where are the zones?  Aside from the map that came with Luclin, can
someone throw in a link to a map of luclin?  not individual zones, but how
each zone connects to each other?  Or something to that effect.  I have no
idea which zones are adjacent to what.  Thank ya.

PS - I'm so broke right now that I just bought my JBB, but insanely happy
about it, so if there are different spots for loot then there are for exp,
throw those in too if you want =0P.


PPS - also have a 47 chanter if there are suggestions for him.. he is on a
non- luclin account.. wish I could just pay 5 bucks for a key, but if there
are places in Luclin that chanters just rule, i may think about spending the
extra money.
