I was down in chardok turning in salt and skin for faction and 
got offered 1k pp to drag someone out from the little rat guy 
down by the treasury area. Actually did it for free, I was 
already there and it took me all of 3 minutes to wander down and 
drag him back out. Took some funny looks from people [went past 2 
groups in fighting mobs] to see me wandering past dragging a body 
and not being invisible=)
