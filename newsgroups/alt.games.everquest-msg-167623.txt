But there are a *lot* of items to help w/ Strength.  Stamina, otoh, is much
more difficult to raise effectively (i.e. with other useful stats included)
through gear.  Personally, I would do 25 into STA and 5 into STR.  There's
enough light gear out there for gnome rogues and weight reducing bags are
also available.  Unless we're talking a really greedy Gnome Rogue (I know,
the concept is a bit redundant).
