As has been said before: the all-inclusive version of EQ Gold is not
available locally in Australia (which is where Grant is). He could order
it internationally from the USA, but it's not available for local
purchase here.

There is an "old" EQ Gold which includes everything until Luclin, which
will get him most of the way, and which *is* available in Australia.
But he would still need to buy two packages rather than one.
