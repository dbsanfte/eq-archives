Funny, I'd expect exactly the inverse.  More detailed character models => 
more cool-looking gear that gets my attention that I'd like to know what 
is without having to interrupt what the wearer is doing...

I generally choose to ask before inspecting, or even just to ask, 'Wow, 
what're those cool-looking pants?'  It tends to provide an opportunity for 
<gasp> role-playing.  

The comparison was made between inspecting someone and looking at someone 
when you pass them on the street... Inspecting is more like checking out 
the tag on the dress to see if it's really a Donna Karan.
