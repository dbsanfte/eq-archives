Hi all - I just made level 18 tonight with my Ranger and am looking
for 1HS suggestions to practice dual wield. (Been using a Nathsar
Greatsword I picked up from a desperate seller in EC for 200pp so my
2HS is maxed) I'll be camping for a Polished Granite Tomahawk with
some friends this week but if we don't get one I'll probably buy one.
I was wondering if anybody has a relatively inexpensive suggestion for
the other hand? I'll have about 400pp to spend total after I sell off
some stuff I have in the bank.

thanks,

Scott
