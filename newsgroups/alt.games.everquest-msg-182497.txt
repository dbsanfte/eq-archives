The others are social with their kind. They'll join if you're already
fighting one.

For comparison, at that level, in a group, in HK basement WR and RR
and the gobbies in between, you are getting experience far faster, on
the pace of several levels a fairly casual night. It isn't even close.
All the dungeons for those levels beat MS for experience - MM, HK, CC,
echo, and so do several kunark outdoor zones (the easy cycle).

On the other hand, MS is easy and has nearby zones.
