However, I gave up on custom UIs because as soon as I would get one set up
the way I liked it, SoE would break it with the next patch. So I would have
to wait for the creator to fix it, set it up the way that I wanted again,
rinse, repeat.

Custom UIs are fun to play with, but can become a PITA.

YMMV,
