I have no problems at all on dialup, and i'm MT most of the time.

Of course.. i normally play with most graphics intensive stuff turned
off. Spell effects for one, roughly half my models are old school, and
the fancy graphics stuff.. mip mapping and all that crud i jettisoned.

General play window is 1280X1024X32 bit on a 19" screen.
