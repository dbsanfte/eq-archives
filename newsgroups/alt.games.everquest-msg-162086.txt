Like, wow.  Our guild got a few of its members flagged for Halls of Honor.
Like, OMG.

The mobs have low AC, low HP, low resists, don't flurry, don't rampage,
don't have any AE's, and give fantastic XP.  We went to a part of the zone
that was basically two rooms side-by-side with four level 63-65 mobs each,
which would on rare occasion drop the parchments that get you high-level
spells.  I made a yellow of regular XP and a yellow of AAXP in two hours,
and at no time was my party ever in danger.  There are the wimpiest 60+ mobs
you've ever seen.

By the end we'd gotten into such a killing rhythm that we cleared out both
rooms well before the respawn and started pulling from the entrance area,
which was jam-packed full of mobs.  I got an AA ding (only six more to MGB,
yeah I've been slacking) and a groupmate dinged 64.

I now plan to live in HoH.  Whenever there isn't a raid, I'll be parked in
there racking up the XP.  This is by far the easiest XP I've seen for 60+
folks.

Of course, now that I've said this Sony will read this post and mega-nerf
the zone.  Bad Monual, can't keep yer trap shut.  =)

But if you're looking for great 60+ XP, get yourself flagged for HoH.  It's
like Velk's without the morons.  =)
