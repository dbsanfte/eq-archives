/shrug

Don't know about "easily"... I've read the arguments about average 
salinity of Arctic waters and blah-de-blah, but there isn't much fossil 
evidence of previous temperature fluctuations actually having shut down 
the Gulf Stream in the past (I do try to keep up with developments, at 
least as far as New Scientist allows).

That doesn't mean that I oppose efforts to stem climate change... it's 
just that the idea doesn't exactly fill me with existential dread either.
