Heh well from one who is a Velious newbie (veteran Ry'Gorr'er, though)
another quirk of Velious factions you'll need to know about is grouping.  If
you're in a group and someone in your group takes a faction hit you do too.
Example:
    If you're not wanting to be kos to dwarves but someone in your group
holds the opposite goal and kills a dwarf, guess what?  You take a dwarf
faction hit too.
