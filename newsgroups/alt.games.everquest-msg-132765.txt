    You know the ones I'm speaking of.  It seems that some idiot troll has lumped us
together with alt.dss.hack, misc.writing, alt.tv.er, and others.  We're part of the
"gang" now, and I have no doubts that we can look forward to being hit with several
more xposted, off-topic, controversial long threads.  I have to admit, I'm guilty of
responding to these things a couple of times, and I feel guilty about it because I
contributed to the  warm fuzzy feeling that the troll feels when his creation sprints
through the various newsgroups, adding to useless noise/quality information ratio. 
Now, I know that a.g.e has it's own fair share of totally off-topic threads, and I'm
fine with that.  At least it's our own self generated noise.  I personally am getting
very tired of seeing long, inflammatory threads going on and on why we should be
afraid if blacks have civil rights or outraged that a muppet caught HIV.
   So, I needed to vent, and I didn't want to do it in the very forum I am
criticizing.  I have to admit, I'm fighting a very powerful urge to find out which
newsgroup the troller comes from, and then xpost with us such topics as "Which is the
Best Race/Class to play"?  or "Is it ok to "inspect" people without asking?".

Annie <--- hoping to proof herself better than that.
