 I'm sure this has been asked before but a friend of mine has had nothing
but problems sense installing SOL. He get's booted to desktop sometimes
every ten min's or so and sometimes he won't for a long time. He's tried
everything we can think of. Tried cutting graphics back and tweaking
everything he can, tried even working on his computer thinking it was
something with it but still nothing. I know he's not the only one this
happens to but he's ready to quit the game over it. Would love to have any
help on this.
