Uh, Harmony got the Rodney King treatment.  We shared the pain with Druids.

Bzzt.. Beastlords.  Ferocity completely owns SoP if you're maxing ATK and
while Spirtual Vigour offers less ATK than SoT you get 100 more HPs to
compensate.  I doubt any of them would stack properly with each other. 

>They are better outdoor pullers than any other class

I'm sure you could put forward a decent case for Bards; can track, can move
faster than any other class in the game, have more HPs and AC to take a
pounding, can cast stuff on the run etc

>They have the best invuln disc (better than monks, warriors, rogues etc
>anyway.. I dunno about versus DA)

Remember the downsides of Weaponshield, it has:

(1) a crappy re-use time which it shares with Trueshot
(2) it's 100% parry so only for melee damage only from the frontal arc

SKs get Harmshield which is invulnerability in the -true- sense of the word
even though I never seem to meet a SK that can use it worth a damn.

>They have the joint best (debatable) spell in the game : ensnare
>(ok very debatable now) They have the best slow of melees

Beastlords are melee and they have better slows in every respect both
castable (65%!) and on their Epics.

If they fix the HUGE projectile engine LoS issues then they could easily
cut back on the damage formulae for AM3 without any loss of utility.  I
very much doubt it will happen though.
