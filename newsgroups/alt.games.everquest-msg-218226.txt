Generally, most people don't care.  The monk is there to deal damage, not 
take damage.  The main tank is there to take damage, and keep others from 
taking damage.  If this warrior or paladin is not the main tank, then, he 
should be behind the mob, and dealing as much damage as he can, but, it 
won't be as much as a real DPS class.
