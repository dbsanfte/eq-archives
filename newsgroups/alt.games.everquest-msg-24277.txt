What would be really funny is if a Warrens-rules, low-level zoned dropped
uber-items, or at least items that would appeal mostly to high-level
players but have little utility to lowbies.

For example, imagine an Sv Fire+20 item that dropped only for lowbies.

You'd have high-level players lined up around the block to buy the item
from lowbies for prices that would quadruple the lowbie's total net worth.
