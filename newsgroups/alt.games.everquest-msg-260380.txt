70% slow is such an effective tool that all new encounters had to be
designed with it in mind.

Should this new mob have insane DPS which drops to a reasonable level when
70% slow lands, or should it start at a more moderate level?

If the devs choose the former, a group without 70% slow will get squashed.
If they choose the latter, a group with 70% slow will have a cakewalk.

Basically, it's one step towards turning EQ into the land of haves vs.
have-nots.  If your group is a "have", then you'll be able to beat
encounters, make phat lewt, and become ever more uber.

If your group is a "have-not", you're fucked.

(Granted, I've overstated the case a little.  This pretty much only
applies to high-end content.  But the concept is still there.)
