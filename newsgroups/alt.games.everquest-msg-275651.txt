Neither one of you obviously has a lot of experience with Wake the Dead.
:)  Yes, WTD pets will create pets, however the duration of WTD makes
it fairly limited. The buffing is nice, although it can be annoying
watching your WTD pet go on a self-buffing spree only to poof. WTD pets
are damaged capped in melee, unfortunately, since in PoP beta it was
decided that the pets were a wee overpowered otherwise. Tell your
friend to try WTD on some dead wizards too, if you do any LDoNs still
for example.
