The Mage has undergone some good changes during the last year.  Playing a
Mage you will be able to summon focus items for all of the casters in your
group.  Your pet will kick butt when you give it your focus items as well.
And pets, like NPCs, can have two focus items that are the same.  So if you
summon the ring focus item you can give two to your pet.  An untwinked Mage,
fully outfited with all of his nifty summoned focus items on himself and his
pet can take out reds all day.  Not too red.  Reds that are just above
yellows.
