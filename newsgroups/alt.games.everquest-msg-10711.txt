E. K. is an excellent place to level but if you are worried about add ons
while you solo, you might want to join an orc or gnoll group in Highpass.
There are two main reasons for doing this besides all the obvious safety of
a group reasons. First, there are guards very close to you in all sections
of the zone if your party gets hammered. They won't insta kill mobs but they
can take them down in a matter of 15 seconds or less. Second, you have a
chance of winning a roll for a named Orc or named Gnoll and the loot they
drop. Do a little research on the net for all the great loot that is dropped
here and you can see why I take all my fledgling characters from 15 to 20
and play them in this zone. Melee characters love the Polished Granite
Tomahawk and all characters love the Shralok pack. Both are now lore items
but there are other great items that drop once you have these. Always try to
keep in a full group at all times when camping orcs and always have at least
three players when camping the gnolls. The orcs spawn too rapidly to have
four or less players there. Your down time medding and healing will never
stay with the spawns unless you have two of the players with the ability to
heal quickly and efficiently.
