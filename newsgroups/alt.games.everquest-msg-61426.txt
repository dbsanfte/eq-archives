I am almost certain, from personal experience, that they round down.

When I as level 29, I was able to group with a level 43 warrior for some
PLing through a slump there.  A 44 cleric was helping, but as soon as he
grouped, I stopped getting xp, so he stayed out of the group.  I could be
wrong about the cleric's level though.
