Its laughable how each expansion, they have attempted to nerf teleport in
some way. First with kunark, we only got 1 port stuck way down the sw corner
of the continent. Wasnt until recently that it was unnerfed so we could evac
direct to EJ or skyfire.

Then come velious, and ports wouldnt work there (save for IC) until you had
gone there on foot anyway and got the item. Now we have Luclin, with
probably no direct ports at all. Gives one the impression that verant regret
giving port spells in the first place, and are tyring to backstep.
