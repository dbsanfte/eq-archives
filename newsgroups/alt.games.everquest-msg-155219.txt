I was ready to abuse you for diplaying what I *thought* was a view that
Western lives were more important than Balinese, but you pointed out that
was not the case. Then I did abuse abuse your for inferring that I thought a
Balinese life was worth more than an Australian when I was only saying I
care more for the Balinese.

Stop bending the words. Consider yourself told, yet again.... fuckwit.

And it's true - I care more for the plight of the Balinese affected than
that of the Australians. I have been there multiple times, I have seen the
drunken yobo tourists that frequent Kuta, throwing up all over the streets
and trying to pick fights with Balinese half their size...

No - I never said that. Are you now inferring that is what I mean when I say
something else? If so, consider yourself told a third time... shithead.

Yes - that is strange actually. It would be just as strange for Indonesian
TV to not ackowledge western casualties too. So - what was your attempted
point again fucktard?

Having a bad day?
