Yup, it does. And as others mentioned, large does indeed drop in Najena
off the Ogre Captain. However...

/agree about the crafted. There is absolutely nothing wrong with
remaining in banded or blackened alloy until you get full crafted. If
you see someone auctioning bronze and you can afford it, well then go
for it if you want. But I wouldn't go out of my way to get it. Crafted
armor is the cheapest of the class quest armors, save up and you'll
eventually get it all.
