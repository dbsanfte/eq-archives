My portrait commission of foxeye is finally done, and I wanted to share it
with ya'll. ^_^  I'm trying to minimize it's exposure, since I'm scared of
people who don't respect copyright (and the money I paid for this), and
who will steal foxeye for their own sigs, but a.g.e is a (for better or
worse) smallish community, compared to what else is out there.
