Coconuts make a wonderful fun present (too bad they're inedible).
I've also once given wild cabbage (which *is* edible) to a troll
warrior with flatulence problems.
As for sop bark, I believe it only exists to annoy tailors, much like
the foraged drachling silk in Dreadlands (yes, I know it's for an
iksar quest. It still annoys the hell out of me)
