Three out of four ain't bad.

The fourth number is not "packet size", it's the average bytes/second
data rate (which gives no indication of the number or size of
packets actually used).

And a minor nit -- the first number isn't just a measurement of
how long it takes data to go from your computer to Verant's, it's
a measure of how long it takes to make the *round trip*.  This
is more useful, since traffic one-way (either way) may be good,
but crappy going the other direction.  Round trip times give a
better overall view of the connection, plus is the most direct
measurement of how good (or poor) your actual game response
time will be.  This is because in order to see a response to
your action, your computer must send the "here's the key I
pressed" information to the server, and then the server has
to send back the "ok, here's the result of that action"
data back to your computer before you actually see a result.
