ok its all good and well being able to see how much you were healed for
(though buggy in that it's not showing every time) but WTF are they
displaying MoK heals for?

as a 60 monk I get big fight spam anyway (with other hits off, my misses
off) without the need to see "you were healed for 3" after every single
hit!!!
