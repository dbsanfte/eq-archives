The same day I installed Velious, I created a new Halfling Rogue then, with
no help from anyone (no Invis, no SoW, nada), Hide / Sneaked all the way
from Rivervale to Thurgadin.  It was a SLOW trip, but entirely simple.  When
I got to Thurgadin I had about 1 yellow bubble of XPs (the XPs I got from
handing in my note before I left).  I got killed once as I entered W
Commons, because I hit the wrong button while right in front of an orc
centurion.

I also made 30 Plat on the run (and could have made a lot more) by looting
corpses and carrying trade goods.

PS:  With a swim skill of 5 and Hide / Sneak running, it takes bloody near
forever to cross the waterways in Iceclad.
