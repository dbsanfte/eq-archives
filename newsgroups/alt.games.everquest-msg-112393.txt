If you have rogues, let them get behind and keep the rangers, monks,
SKs, etcetera in front of the mob.  The mob will occassionally turn
from the MA.  If the mob "turns" to the ranger beside the MA, the
rogue can still backstab.  If the mob turns to the SK beside the
rogue, the rogue cannot backstab.
