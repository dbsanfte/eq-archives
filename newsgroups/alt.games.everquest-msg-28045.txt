I dunno, that name could last a while.  It's altered enough that most people
won't get it unless it's explained to them or they stop and sound it out a
few times.  Also, I don't know everyone's petitioning standards, but I
personally report names only if they are offensive or just plain ludicrous
for a fantasy world (Humpalot or Busta Capp, for example).  If I see a name
that's a distorted real world word or phrase that fits the character and the
game world, I don't report it, I applaud the player for a job well done.
