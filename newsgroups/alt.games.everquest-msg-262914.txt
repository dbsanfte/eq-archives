    The enchanter should have tash and root - and that's all he needs.

    The cleric can't have more than 36 points of self-generated mana regen, 
and most will have substantially less (not counting a horse). If the cleric 
is going OOM, it's not because of their mana regen rate.

    If you cannot be CH'ed, the group cannot succeed no matter what else 
they have. If you cannot tank the nameds, the group cannot succeed at the 
one thing you go to WoS to do - get the named loot. You are the baseline. If 
the cleric has a small pool and weak mana regen, you can pull slower. If the 
DPS isn't all it should be, you can pull slower. If the tank is made of wet 
cardboard, you all die and go on a corpse run. I don't think they should be 
as crass as they are about asking, but if they think they'll be at the edge 
of what they can do safely, I can understand why they do it.

    And to answer the original question in the thread, 10400 HPs / 2080 AC 
with proper buffs/leadership AA's/no tribute. I, the cleric, have the same 
HPs/AC roughly as Furor did when FoH beat Rallos Zek in Tactics. Gotta love 
mudflation!
