In my opinion it wasn't cheating. It was a form of twinking, but
there's never been any indication that such things bother Verant, at
least not enough for them to take action against it (preventative or
punitive).

The important part of your message, though, is first two sentences I
quoted above - how *you* felt. Only you can decide how to react to
your own feelings, of course, but if it feels wrong to you, then I'd
recommend you not do it any more.
