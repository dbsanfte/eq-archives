Go ahead and judge without knowing what it's like.  I don't mind.  If 
you come in to where I work and treat me like a human being, I'll do the 
same for you.  If you don't, I'll make sure your service is slow, your 
food is cold, and hope you'll never come back.  PS - never touched one 
customer's food, EVER.  It does, however, help immensely to fantacize 
about it.  And hearing the stories I've heard, there are several times 
where I don't blame other servers for doing what they've done.
