Yes, the designers of Paineel decided that they didn't want any outsiders in
there, even less than in the Iksar place (Cabalis I think).
    I've killed 200+ kobolds & had almost immediately went from
threateningly to dubious, and after 200+ kills am still there.  I gave up on
Paineel (the "pain" part of it is right).  I got faction in shadowhaven
(Luclin zone, east of Nexus, the port in zone) up to amiable in many places.
I bound at soul binder there, and gate back to sell/bank.  I've sense then
given up on this insanely hard city to get into, and am using this alternate
method if I ever return for any reason.
    The guards are not stationary, but they have VERY small agro radius, but
if threateningly, you'd better RUN directly between them (I mean almost
exactly in the middle) or they will move closer to kill you.
    When you zone in from tox forest, the Paineel newbie area is on your
left (as you saw).  If you go to the drop off, and follow the path to the
right, it dead ends.  Click the rock there and you'll see that you need a
key.  The opening is that section dug out of the cliff behind it.  It rises
up out of the floor (the ground lifts up, exposing an elevator like shaft,
which you go down into, to get to the city).  I've not been down there, but
saw a newbie open it up so that's how I've seen the door.  I'm not too
anxious to get to amiable until I'm high enough LV to have my pet (I'm a
necro, Dark Elf) go through the warrens, wiping out the kobolds to get me
faction QUICKLY!
    Personally I think this whole "you've got to be amiable to even get into
the city" is one of the WORST (if not the worst) faction issue that some
drunk, drugged, insane, insanely stupid, beat on the head a million too many
times, inbred for 10+ generations, psychopathic programmer designed.
    I challenge someone else to mention a worse faction situation...and I
hope to God you don't succeed either, otherwise it's just a warning of where
to stay away from.
