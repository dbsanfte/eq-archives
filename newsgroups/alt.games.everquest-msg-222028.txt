The charm spell does not have a list of mobs that are uncharmable, rather, 
some mobs are marked as immune to charm, same as ones that are immune to 
movement speed changes, or immune to combat speed changes.  The charm spell
(s) do have level limits, which differ for the different spells.  I believe 
it is level 64 maximum for Command of Druzzil.
