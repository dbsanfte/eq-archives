I've heard that you can drop down and die from 10,000 points damage?
I'd like to do this.
Not to my main character of corse. Is there an easy access to the jump point
for a newbie?  If so how do I get there and what race/class is needed to
start in best (probably closest) area to the drop point?
I've enjoyed jumping off high areas with other characters before (taking
screen shots of myself falling).  Although I had a little problem with my
Halfling Druid.
Go to tall tower on hill in Misty Thicket.
Sit on top wall in corner at highest point from ground.
Buff myself with Skin Like Wood.
Jump and take damage for 3 points more than my total HP (was knocked
unconcious, but not first time, had another character about a year ago fall
for total HP+7).
Recover and go back up to sit and heal.
Accedently fell off > SPLAT! LOADING PLEASE WAIT...
Went back to sit spot and started to memorize spells.
Got up forgetting that I was about as close as you can get to the edge and
fell to my death (wasn't buffed yet).
Went back and was memorizing spells again.
Was attacked which causes you to stand and step forward, in my case off the
edge of the tower, falling for 264 HP damage (I had 45 HP total).
Returned again and was going to memorize spells, forgot I had RUN on and
went too far, splat again.
Getting tired of accedental deaths from falling, I go back up, run and jump
as far out as I can and fell for near 300 HP damage (no armor, no buffs, far
fall for halfling with NO AC).
Went back and I'm pretty sure I fell again and died.
This time, having enough pain, I took a screenshot of myself standing in the
middle of my pile of corpses at the base of the tower.
Seeing how much fun this was, I wish my Ogre had BIND AFFINITY and wasn't
KOS to most places.
