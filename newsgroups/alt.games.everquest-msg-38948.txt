Not that I agree with him, but he chose 9 for those two classes (and would
have for SK's too, if he had remembered) because 9 is the first level where
hybrids gain any spells at all.   Up until then they play exactly the same as
a warrior / rogue / etc.

Most classes don't gain any real levels of differentiation until the early to
mid teens.   Hell, a level 7 cleric is much more likely to be up on the front
lines using melee than casting any kind of healing spell.  Since he can't
meditate until level 8, anything he does cast is going to be all of his
spellcasting activity for the next 15 - 20 minutes.
