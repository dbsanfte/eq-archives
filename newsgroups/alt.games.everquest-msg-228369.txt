Shrug. Dying and walking back sucked. The spellbook sucked. The
boats sucked. But the feeling of acomplishment didn't, and I am
not sure the one can be had without the other. Those long boring
events fostered conversation and camaraderie. Those hideous death
penalties gave a real tension and fear of death. That stupid
stupid spellbook made level 35 WOOHOOO!!! 

And so on. A diet of sugar gets boring after a while. But then
I disliked POP and loathed LDON so ;) I may not be the average
punter. My favourite expansion was Velious, and THAT was
factionquest ;) I thought Velious was moving in the right
direction actually... 

I do know what you mean. The first time you ride the boats its
awe inspiring. the 50th time its just annoying - you want to be
there. But I liked the portal 'teeth' in Velious that meant
you could port somewhere after you'd hoofed it there once, that
sort of thing. And I do remember when EQ was smaller, pre
kunark, the boats were pretty busy - there'd be big conversations
and chatter crossing the Ocean of Tears, you'd get to know people
make groups on the boats to hunt the mysterious Unrest with
and such.

I liked it ;)
