Gore is a monster compared to Sev and Tal.

Well your level 54.. and that matters more than your resists by a long way.
If its of any comfort though, Gores AE ripped me apart at level 60 too

I bought this up a long time ago, and Arolpin shot it down

When your not nuking, get the hell out of AE range.  Depending where your
fighting, if you can position the mob on a wall, then use a corner etc to
hide from the AE.

How close were you guys getting?  Gore cheals, which can really mess a raid
up.  Some methods for stopping the cheal...

While the raid buffs and prepared, have a bard kiting Gore around.  Not only
will this prevent gore accidently agroing, but she will be casting on the
bard (who can stay out of melee range) and slowly but surely her mana gets
lower.

Theft of thought.. a chanter spell (lvl 51?) that tseals mana from a mob...
get a couple of chanters to cast this (it has a long recast)

When she gets low, try and coordinate your nuking somewhat... or just all
out burn her so she can't cheal anyway.

Also, Gore has an AE slow which really kills melee dps.  Have your MA not
only build up agro, but to call out AE's.  When he calls all in (as soon as
he has enough agro, and as soon as the ae fired), have all melee run in and
immediatle go offensive discs.

Casters rule a Gore fight...  kill her befoe the AE kills your raid
