Large scale battles is the only time when things get remotely
interesting.  For single group hunts, there's damn little you need to
know. 

How long does it take people to learn to assist one person?  How long
does it take people to learn not to wake mezzed mobs?  These things
aren't exactly brain surgery.  If you can't understand these simple
things within 15 minutes of being told, stop playing and find
something less challenging like tic-tac-toe.

It's only when you start worrying about mob positioning, AoEs, aggro
control, heal chains, that you start dealing with some of the more
"advanced" concepts.  Even these are fairly straight forward once
people pay attention.
