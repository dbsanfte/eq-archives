Are you sure you're indifferent to Bixies?

This can happen if you're KoS to a mob, and standing near it
while someone else fights it.  What happens is that the mob
aggros on you (the same it would if it were unengaged and
you were standing near it, and it decided to attack you),
but because it's already engaged, you don't notice your
addition to its "hate list".

Then when it dies, everyone on its hate list (including you)
gets a faction hit.

But this shouldn't happen if you're truly not KoS to the Bixies.
Nor is Selos an area-effect song which should have touched
either the Bixie, *or* the person it was fighting.

Are you sure you didn't play any other songs for a moment?
