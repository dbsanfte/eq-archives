I always thought that was how Bards "spoke" in game:
a_bard_01 tells you, "Hi"
a_bard_01 tells you, "!"
a_bard_01 tells you, "glad"
a_bard_01 tells you, "to"
a_bard_01 tells you, "hear"
a_bard_01 tells you, "th"
a_bard_01 tells you, "at"
a_bard_01 tells you, ":)"
a_bard_01 tells you, "gr"
a_bard_01 tells you, "atz"
a_bard_01 tells you, "on y"
a_bard_01 tells you, "ou"
a_bard_01 tells you, "r e"
a_bard_01 tells you, "pic"
a_bard_01 tells you, "cya"
a_bard_01 tells you, "l"
a_bard_01 tells you, "ate"
a_bard_01 tells you, "r bro"
