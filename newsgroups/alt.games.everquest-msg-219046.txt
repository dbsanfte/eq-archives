No, Darkspanky, it was always about how odd it was, that you failed
so often on something you couldn't improve at anymore.  It was a
comment that that situation is weird, stupid, goofy.  I never sat
around whining "I should succeed more!!!", as your post suggests.

......and you found a girlfriend.  Will wonders never cease.  Don't
ever let her read your posts on a.g.e, or she'll leave you.
