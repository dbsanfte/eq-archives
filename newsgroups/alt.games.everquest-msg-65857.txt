I miss being able to do it that way. My last two commercial products
each topped out at 200+ pages of design documentation before the first
line of code was written. I have yet to be able to finish either, (one
in progress, one destroyed with most of its source on 9/11)  so I
don't know how much time we're ultimately saving.

I'm still a big fan of the iterative waterfall method of software
development. Even if the user does know exactly what he wants in the
planning phase, it's rarely what he wants by the time you're done.
