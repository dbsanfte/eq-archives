Heh, they did that in PoP.  That's why knights are popular there.  You
see, the Cleric doesn't go oom healing a knight, and the Wizard doesn't
have to sit around at FM waiting for it to be safe to nuke the mob.
The whole setup screws the Warriors (Warriors with excellent gear can
handle it though, so it's not totally broken).  What they really need
to do is make it so Warriors have something unique and special to offer
the XP group, ideally it should have limited raid usefulness to help
address Furor's "complaint" that his PoTime geared knights are better
tanks for most raid encounters than his Warriors (note the possessive
language is _his_, I'm just the not so neutral reporter).

For instance, Warriors ought to have a way to at least briefly save the
robes and healers that works differently from the knights' raw hate
tactic and is better than said tactic somewhere between half and all of
the time, depending on how frequently it can be used.  Yes, this might
involve changing some mobs, or perhaps adding a bit of randomness to
mob agro in the form of a small chance that the mob arbitrarily adds a
big amount of hate to an action it doesn't like by somebody on its hate
list that is not currently in melee (heh, maybe go for a Ranger once in
a while that way as well). In fact, this last, assuming that the Warrior
agro control ability worked to counter it, would be excellent, giving a
situation where the Warrior can handle something the knight might not be
able to.  it's have a nice side effect of allowing Wariors and knights
to better complement each other, making multi-tank groups a bit more
attractive.

If Wariors were given better agro control via increased hate
generation, yes it would make the classes more similar.  And
this would not necessarily be a great deal for Wariors.  Sadly,
that appears to be SOE's approach, they're mucking about with
increasing the +hate from Warrior-only augments.

Agreed.
