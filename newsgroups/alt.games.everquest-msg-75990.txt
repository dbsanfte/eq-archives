Wow, took you a few weeks for that flame. I was wondering when I was next to
be put in my place. I managed to send in rather a few posts before this
flame. I finally feel accepted now.

Right, I'm of to sleep. I have an early day tommorow. I'm meeting a few
clients. They want some database work done. Funny too, since I sell and
operate the things. One wonders why, since it's common knowledge that I know
shit about databases.

Oh and Sanjian, friend, ask Verant why they don't want to add extra bank
space or spell slots. Common, ask them. Oh it's perfectly ok to do so,
afterall once you've been proven wrong you can always not mention it to us.
No harm done, we won't think any less of you.
