When you put 1 point in it starts at your current level, i.e. 16. I
believe this is already over the skill cap for your level and so you
won't actually be able to spend any more training points on it, or gain
anything from practice research, for a couple of levels (I can't
remember the exact level cap formula offhand). When you can dump more
points in it, it is far easier to put your 5 practice points into that
each level than it is to find all the silly drops for the concordance
quest (and waste a bank slot with the concordance).
