This may be common knowledge to most people, but although I have found many
good websites explaining about the different tradeskills, what I havent seen
is which stat relates to which tradeskill, ie smithing is done from strength
but fletching from wisdom?

If anybody could enlighten me as to which is used for what, or point me to a
website with such information I would be grateful.
