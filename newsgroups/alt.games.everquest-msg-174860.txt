Sanj was speaking of Paladins, Paladins don't get Kick, so in this
case your reach exceeded your grasp.

Ghetto bash is way too clumsy and inefficient when you're using a
2-hander, you lose too many attacks.  Only case I've seen ghetto
bash work out reasonably well is with a dual-wielding Warrior of
one of the non-Slamming races, and even then it's too much like
playing a Bard.  I mean, if you're gonna take the trouble to do
frequent on-the-fly gear swapping, why not just make a Bard and
get rewarded for your efforts by being the most powerful class in
the game instead of being a helpless melee?
