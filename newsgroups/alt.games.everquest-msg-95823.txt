I will try putting it on the 2nd controller by itself to test that, but as
far as the failure mode, the drive spins, lights flash etc, then all
activity stops.  When clicking the drive letter it just says unable to read.
Both audio and data do this.  One of my kids games will work, eventually
crash (children's software is buggy TRASH usually) and it won't read the CD
ever again.
Also, I forgot to mention, if there is a CD in the drive the computer won't
boot up at all once it looks for bootable CD's.

Thanks for the reply,
SEAN...
