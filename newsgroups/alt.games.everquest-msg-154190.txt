LOL....since KEI has come out, and that ive gone full circle through
all of my characters (i have 2 accounts with one of each class) I
ended up playing my enchanter again and finding it impossible to get a
group. This is at 27th level as well. So im doing the best I can
soloing in LOIO in the morning and I see a shout from someone asking
why a 51st was in the zone. Then i see an ooc from a 25th beastlord
(who didnt reply when i asked him if he wanted to group) saying that
the 51st cleric was there on a Pleveling session for him. A short
while later i get a tell from the cleric asking for a breeze.
LOL....since KEI made a death knell for low level enchanters its kind
of ironic a 50+ level player is asking me for a breeze after they dont
want me intruding on their little lap dance in the corner.
Hehehe.....i was happy to not reply.
