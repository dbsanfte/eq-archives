  MMORPGs did not begin with Everquest, or
even Ultima Online for that matter (well, the
Massively part maybe, they certainly took the
number of players to greater heights than I ever
envisioned.)  My online multiplayer rpg gaming
experience goes back to 1988 on Compuserve.
(Raise your hand if you're a true trailblazer that
even knows what the heck things like CI$ and
GEnie even were).
