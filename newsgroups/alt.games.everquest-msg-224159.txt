A better way is

/g message
/cast 1
/cast 1
/cast 1
/cast 1

each line is .25 seconds, so you have plenty of time for the
server/client to sync up if you were moving, it takes care of
all but the worst fizzle streaks.

here's one for a mage -

/rt
/ttell Incoming rod, Catch!
/cast 7
/cast 7
/cast 7

the result is that the last person to tell me gets a mod-rod and a message.

Of course, if I still have my pet summoning spells up, I get a muzzle of
mardu on my cursor.

Typical conversation -
"May I have a rod please?"
"Incoming rod, Catch!"
"I didn't get one"
"You sure?  Check your bags for one you might have already."

/em notices the muzzle of mardu on his cursor

"NM - just sec"
"Incoming rod, Catch!"
"Nice throw!"  

I may not have it verbatim, but this happened last night.
