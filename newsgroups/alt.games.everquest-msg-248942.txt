For a long time, on Yahoo Messenger, MSN, AIM, etc 'gtg' to myself and those I
chatted with meant 'Got to go'.  As in, "Hey, I gtg bbl kk?"  (LOL)

Only when I started playing EQ did I realize that people were using it as "good
to go" and several times I was caught saying "Aw, okies, we'll cya later" to
which the person would reply "/boggle".
