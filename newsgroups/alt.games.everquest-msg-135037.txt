Let me preface this with the disclaimer, it is third hand information.

A friend of mine, told me that a friend of hers recently had his account
banned because his son was using EQW.  Supposedly, friends of his son, knew
he was using EQW, got a GM, and the accounts were banned.  I asked several
times, are you sure it was EQW, not ShowEQ?  She says that she asked him
that question too, verifying it was EQW.  I still have a hard time accepting
this as factual, but, just thought I'd pass it on.  I tend to believe that
EQW had nothing to do with the banning, that either he was running some
other program, or that there was some other issue involved.
