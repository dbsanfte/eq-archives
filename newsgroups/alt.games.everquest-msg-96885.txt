You were lucky

In my day, we used to DREAM of dual weilding Yaks!
Anyone with a gypsy bought Combine weapon was 'uber twinked'
Oracle Robe was 'must have' for any caster over 30
We'd dream at night of being able to afford those la-de-dah "Well Balanced"
weapons Shady sells!
Kids today... they don't know they're bloddy well BORN! :o)
