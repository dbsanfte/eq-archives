Well, let's bring it on topic: I think a gmail address would be good to use
on beta signups.  Right now, whenever I read here that someone has received
an EQ2 beta invite, and I notice that I haven't received one, I have to go
and check my spam traps to see if it got caught.

If I had used a gmail address, I'd be able to basically do a Google search
on that account's mail to look for it, which would be a lot easier than
going through a bunch of spam.

I do agree that it is time for people to stop posting gmail invites, though.
I think *everyone* who has a gmail account gets 6 invites to give out, and
some people get a lot more (I have no idea how they decide who gets more).
I had 6 invites to give out as soon as I got invited.  I gave out 3, and
Google gave me 3 more to bring me back to 6.  I believe they are very near
the end of their beta, and are now in the "we want this to spread as widely
as possible" phase.  That means that getting a gmail invite is no longer
hard, so having invites to give is no longer special.

For those with invites just sitting around, instead of posting them to
newsgroups, check out

    http://www.gmail4troops.com/

That's a group that collects gmail invites and gives them to troops abroad.
Gmail is much better for troops than most other free webmail services,
because the 1 gig mailboxes are big enough for their families to mail movies
and lots of photos of home, and the interface is nicer and much faster.
