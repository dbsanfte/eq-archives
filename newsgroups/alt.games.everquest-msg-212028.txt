I didn't mean to suggest they were, I was copying down the text I printed
out just as it came.  Says 0.85 so I typed 0.85.  Yes indeed, this is
commonly listed as 85, and the default is 75.  Why on earth this particular
list puts a decimal place in I have no idea.  But the unique styling ought
to make it easily traced.

Thats a pity, list shows Warrens as 150 (well ok, it shows 1.50, I'm trying
to cooperate though).  Still, a heck of a lot better than the 85 of POP
zones, why is the Hole deserted in favor of POJ for the low 50 crowd?
