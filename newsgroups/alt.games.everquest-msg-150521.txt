equippable?

Yeah, but it's like depending on Instill Doubt to fear kite.

It won't work when you need it.  Back when I was weilding
dual bloodpoints, it seemed like I'd get 90 hps ever time I was
34 hps down, and none when I was down to 200 total
hps left.

Also, the Black Acrylia Rapier (and some other BA weapons
that are rogue-equippable) have a 45 pt. lifetap, too.
