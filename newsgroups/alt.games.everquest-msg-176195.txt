Bards are nice as they get dual wield and double attack as well, in
addition they too can fear kit, snare, heal their wounds fast, at 20
they're faster than most things in game, can slow, haste, mez, charm,
kite 15+ mobs at once etc. etc.

I tried a warrior for a bit, but just found them a bit bland for my
liking.  To each his own though, I'm sure some have an absolute hoot
with their tank.
