Actually I don't remember seeing any of the pro DAoC posts using d00d speak,
most probably see themselves as educating us to the fact there is something
better out there but the truth is, most of us know all about DAoC having
given it at least a 1 month trial. I was just using the d00d to emphasise
how these posts are now seen here.

I think Verant can learn loads from what has been done with DAoC and maybe
implement some of it in SWG, but my opinion hasn't changed to which game is
more enjoyable.
As for verants customer service, had one dealing with them, it wasn't
particularly pleasant but the issue was eventually solved, although my
complaint was something that effected everyone in Europe so I doubt it was
my email alone that did it I am happy with the change and also aware that it
cost Verant.
