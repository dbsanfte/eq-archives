I've noticed that after fiddling with my assorted character with
Luclin graphics (can do one or two at a time in addition to the
kitties) and then go to old models and velious graphics, the velious
graphic pieces are bugged. They show with non-velious graphics, and
the graphic remains even when I remove the piece of armor. Taking off
the offending piece of armor and zoning removed the bug - my unarmored
body parts didn't show a graphic, and I got the velious look when I
put my armor back on.
