Are you using Texture Caching?  I began having this same problem
after the Feb 13th patch - (P4, 512MB, WinME, SB Live, GeForce 2).
After several hours of playing, I would go into a zone (seemed to
make no difference whether or not I had previously visited that
zone) and find video frames-per-second dropping to an unplayable level
making movement pure torture, especially turning.  Camping, quitting,
and restarting EQ always fixed things, but the same problem would begin
again several hours later.  As per your observation, this occurred in
many different zones, and zone population seemed to make no difference.

I cured all this by turning off Texture Caching and deleting the .txc
files from the EQ directory.  Hasn't happened since.  (knock-on-wood)
Good luck!
