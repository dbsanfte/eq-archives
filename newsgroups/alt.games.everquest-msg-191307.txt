I would like to get a good supply of poison ingredients. I have a
"friend" who wants to know. ;-)

I am doing some xping in Nagafen's lair and stocking on Henbane, and
soot hemlock. That is a little expensive for making that special blade
lubricant.

Anyone got any tips on where to hunt to get exp and some ingredients?

I keep making trips to Najena for whores bane from teh mages and
ogres, but I run it out too fast! BEsides, Whores bane makes me
sneeze.
