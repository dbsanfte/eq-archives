I'd think "Decrease Stamina Loss by 3" might be a bigger deal even than 
12AC.  VoG also lasts almost half again as long.  I'm not sure about 
weighting of +ATK... It would sort of make sense if this went along the 
same lines as AC that we were just discussing, ie, for each mob there's a 
limited range where changes in ATK make a significant difference.  I'd 
expect that most non-melees are below that range, so one could make the 
same argument as one uses for not bothering with AC on casters, ie, 
that you'd never make enough of a difference to get up to that range and 
make it worthwhile.  I don't have any real evidence to back that up 
though.  Does anyone else?

Pesonally, the instant I see a cleric stand up and whack something, they 
get whatever haste I'm giving out, without asking.  Unless I'm really low 
on mana, but I don't usually see clerics meleeing when that's the case. :)
