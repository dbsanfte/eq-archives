First of all, just what were you doing that netted you 100pp per night,
LOL?  And did everyone in the group make that much? ;)

Seriously, though, I spent a year on my first character and she hit a peak
of 22 or so.  Then I made a Warrior mule and realized it was my niche; she
hit 50 in 8 months or so.  Since then I've gotten 2 others past 30, and I'm
enjoying them both.

There's a psychological barrier to hitting 30, to be honest.  It seems very
far off, very high, to some people.  And there can also be a more practical
barrier--meaning some people just don't have the time to devote to dungeon
groups, which is where most people (at least pre-Kunark) have gone from
20-30.  I've found 20-30 to be a not-so-fun-or-easy stretch, too, with 30-50
being much more enjoyable.  They may get around 24 or 25 and hear about
"hell levels" starting at 30, and just peter out. (30 is a laughable hell
level, 40 is the only one that gave me any problems up until 51.)

So, in other words, some folks just play different ways.  That's about the
most I can figure.  More power to 'em as long as they don't ruin someone
else's night. :)
