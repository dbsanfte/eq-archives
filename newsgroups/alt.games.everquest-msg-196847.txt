I'll definately agree with you on Halas. I guess I'm partial to it because
it was the first place I ever saw in Everquest and I spent a lot of time
there.

I haven't really spent much time in Shar Vahl. I made a short visit there
while heading to Paludal Caverns once or twice. I got a little lost and
confused in there but I'm sure it would get a little easier to navigate once
you've been running around there for a while. Maybe I'll start a kitty next
time I make a new character? I had also contemplated a dwarf. Kaladim didn't
seem so bad.
