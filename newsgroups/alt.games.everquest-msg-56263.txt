Only tangential to the topic, buy you've hit on one of my favorite pet
peeves. Did you ever consider the fact that it's probably a shorter run
up the wall to the WC zone, or even to Nek Forest for that matter, than
to run dragging a full spawn of orcs to the tunnel where you will
endanger the lives of any lowbies there, and annoy the ubers who you are
now enlisting as your personal newbie guards when your group fucks up?
