Im currently a level 32 wizard and although i can use the alternative 
advancement for many levels yet i was reading something which suggests i 
should start planning for it.
I was reading that i should be setting aside some points everytime i 
level that i can spend later in the aa pool.
What level 32 be a good time to start leaving putting 1 train point 
every time i level for this?
If its too early now when would be a good time to start this.
Also what are the recommended aa for a wizard, other than the obvious 
mana burn.

thanks
