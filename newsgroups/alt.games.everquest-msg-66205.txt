no, but on my server (Firiona vie) which is the LEAST populated and average
approx 1 player per zone, they apparently don't have much to do. the 3 times
i've petitioned ive gotten a response about 3 seconds later. after sol one
even ported to my location for no reason other than to show me what the
different robes looked like.

don't expect me to feel bad, it is a game and they're not all overworked.
don't dilude yourself
