Did you pick up an Enshrouded Veil yet?

Nice stats for  a cleric face item, and summoning efficiency III...well
its not very important to most pet classes, but we summon a pet every
fight, it adds up!  And Summon efficiency is 25% savings, too, not a wimpy
10%.  180 mana for your maxwell's silver hammer?  Gotta love it!  But then
I'm remembering when he cost 600 mana to get up and running...

Anyway, they seem to run around 1Kpp on Morell Thule in the bazaar, which
is astonishing considering the price of almost every other level III focus
item.
