Character born on August 5th 2002
Total Played Time 61 days

Oh yeh, and let's not forget the 55th warrior, 52nd mage, 51st necro, 
all of whom have taken up a lot of my time (the warrior especially, 
since he was my first character, and I knew nothing about what I should 
have been doing).

My 65th wizard stalled and took a long time to get to 65 for two reasons,

1. he's a master tinker (skill 250), and that took a LOT of real time to 
achieve, hunting, farming, combining, selling, running around, and 
sitting in one place.  I would estimate about 5-10 days of played time 
alone doing this.

2. I made the mistake of doing AA when I hit 51, and got run3, and then 
a couple of points in regen before I realised what a big mistake it was 
and went back to levelling.  He's got 29 points of AA now, most of that 
earned between 62 and 65 doing 50/50 aa/xp.

Still, he's got Improved Familiar (pinged that about 20 minutes after 
dinging 65, which was nice), which is another 6 mana/tick and 200 in the 
mana pool, so that's pleasing.
