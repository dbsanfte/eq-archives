They never did it. They were going to do it, then decided not to
(Probably due to player outcry.) The time period was one month until
deletion was possible, I think. What probably happened was they knew
they'd have a customer service nightmare, possibly because they
checked some characters, when someone who did not play for a month and
never head about it lost a fungi tunic or something on a deleted level
1 character. Some players mentioned how it could happen, they probably
figured it would as well. In the end they decided the small amount of
space they'd save would not be worth the CS problems.

If I remember right they said they made some wiser choice, like
increasing character server capacity or something.
