}Id expect any chanter with a clue would have at least 1 AE stun and 1 single

}mez, stun, mez..  mob gating?  use that same stun spell

Well, you'd be wrong.  AE stun, yes, but chanters don't get a single target 
stun that doesn't completely suck until level 55.  Even then, most times I'd 
choose two AE stuns, assuming I have the slots.  In general, I have one, but 
not always.

The theme I am noticing is that you all think chanters get bonus spell 
slots.  You expect me to have two stuns, it's a given I have to have mez and 
tash, someone else thinks I should be memblurring, and of course the tanks 
want their haste NOW and god forbid the casters should have to ask twice for 
a mana regen.  If there's no shaman I'm also supposed to be slowing and 
crippling, apparently...  At least none of you are insisting I nuke if I 
have extra mana today. :)

In general, the lineup is either mez, ae mez, stun or mez, glamour/rapture, 
stun, followed by two swap slots for buffs, nukes, and whatall, followed by 
slow, root, tash.  Sometimes a shammy shows up and slow gets dropped which 
gives me sooo much extra freedom.  I might throw in that second stun. 
Usually, one stun is enough, though.

Why you sometimes have to wait for a buff:  I'm sorry, clarity, gift of 
insight, brilliance, haste, intellectual superiority, and resist magic are 
not all memmed right now.  I have a different one up.  As soon as the tank 
gets aggro enough on that critter I just tashed and slowed for me to sit 
down and switch them, I will.  In the meantime, hold your horses, 14.6 
seconds sans clarity/haste/whatever is -not- a crisis.  Oh wait, you want me 
to clarity you, or mezz the 4 adds the tank just pulled?  You're right.  
Here's your cla-- Loading, Please Wait.

}> and as a bonus, hybrids don't interrupt their melee output as much
}> as clerics do, so it takes less DPS away for them to stun.
}huh?  the chanter is doing no dps.. the cleric is doing none to minimal
}dps.. i know which classes id rather have cast stun to not decrease dps

Stun generally increases aggro considerably though.  In general, if I can 
not cast it, I consider that a very good thing.  Unless we're AoE grouping 
or something.
