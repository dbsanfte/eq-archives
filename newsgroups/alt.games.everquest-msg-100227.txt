Good question.  It is almost depressing to me that I woulld have to go
and start questing for exp again.  It took me forever to get to 60 and
when I did it was like a warm spring day (no pollen).  There was
nothing better.  Nothing but wandering around getting epic crap (still
do not have it) helping guildies on and on.

Then they brought in the AA.  I could handle that because you knew you
could never be higher than 60.
