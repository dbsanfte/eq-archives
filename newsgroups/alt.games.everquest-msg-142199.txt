I suspect our copyright system (excepting possibly any recent changes
driven by the RIAA) is actually fine. The problem *is* the RIAA. It's
not uncommon that some people to not think critically (not meaning
you, kaev) and demonize one group (artists) based on another (RIAA).

Just about any good thing can be fucked up by a bastard who has money
and is greedy for more.
