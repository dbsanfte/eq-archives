Not even close, although most of the exceptions I can think of are in PoP.
Hobgoblins in PoN are the first that come to mind, being an unstunnable 
mob that is frequently mezzable (if you use a high enough mez.  GoK works 
about 50%, rapture on most of them, haven't seen apathy fail yet.)

There are at least 3 kinds of stun:

1) the kind that has a duration, and isn't breakable, like the chanter 
color line.  Usually, if your chanter screams that he can't stun mob X, 
this is what he just tried.  I think a couple of the higher-level paladin 
stuns may be of this sort.

2) the kind that has a duration, but -is- breakable by people hitting or 
nuking the mob.  Whirl til You Hurl, Dizzying Draught.  Enchanters never 
bother to cast these, a lot of them never even buy the spell, so there's 
very little data on them.  I've never found a particularly good use for 
them, but admittedly, I didn't try very hard. :) Largarnn's Lamentation 
has been handy on occasion though, I think it fits in here.

3) Instantaneous stuns - they basically are good for interrupting mob 
casting and/or building aggro.  For the second purpose, it hardly matters 
whether the mob is unstunnable or not. :) The stun component of enchanter 
nukes fits in this category.

Then there's at least 3 kinds of mezzes, but I'll save that for another 
post.  There's only one kind until you get to about level 53 anyway. :) 
You can usually tell the lines apart by the resist adjustment on 
lucy.fnord.net though.

There's a lot of confusion on this issue.  There are quite a few mobs that 
are very high magic resistance, but aren't flagged against stuns or mezzes 
(or slows), and people tend to declare these mobs unstunnable / unmezzable 
/ unslowable despite the fact that if they went off and gained 10 levels 
and came back, they'd suddenly find their stuns and mezzes sticking.  
There are definitely mobs that are mezzable with one type of mezz but not 
another, distinguished by the 'this critter can't be mezzed (with that 
spell)' message.  Then what usually happens is that the chanter only 
bothered to mem one type of mezz, so he screams "argh! I can't mezz that! 
everyone switch to that I'll mezz the other!"  And everyone thereafter 
tells their friends that xxx is unmezzable.  Despite the fact you just 
need to use Glamour of Kintaz or Rapture instead of Dazzle.  Many of these 
mobs the issue is that they are higher than the level cap for the 
particular mezz, so it isn't even a flag setting on the type of mob.  But 
there are mobs where dazzle line is flagged 'not work' and the other lines 
are ok, or two lines don't work but the third will.

Then there's the outright unmezzable no matter what mobs.  They suck.  
Damn you, archaic contraptions in PoI. :)

Anyway, the situation is the same for stuns.  I've seen many a mob that I 
couldn't stun at all, and got a 'can't be stunned' message, but the pally 
next to me had no problem and wondered what I was whining about.  Think I 
saw this a few times in PoD courtyards.

And usually unrootable and unsnareable go together, but again, not 
-always-. :)

I'd really love to see a database, or an add-on to eqbeastiary, where they 
listed the actual detected flags.

But getting back to the original point:  Yes, most giants and giant-class 
mobs (like dragons) can't be mezzed or stunned come hell or high water.  
Burning woods may be an exception... I seem to recall FM giants being 
stunnable but very resistantly with color line, and not stunnable by the 
chanter nuke line, and definitely unmezzable.  But it's been a long time 
so I won't swear to it. :)
