Almost, but not quite.

It is a little better. At least we now know it
doesn't mean "kill all unbelievers", as some
people would have you believe.

You have still omitted to mention that this verse
is in relation to pagans who had broken a peace
treaty.

The Koran expressly forbids the use of violence,
except in self defence, and this verse is
recommending the use of self-defence, something I
would have thought most people would find
admirable.

Do you not find it admirable?

In that way, it is much less hypocritical than
those who purportedly follow the teachings of
Christ, and who should really be turning the other
cheek, even when confronted by weapons of mass
destruction.
