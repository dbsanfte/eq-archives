Ok...... swinging wildly away from the current topic, this brings up
something I've been meaning to ask. There's an example of one of the two
forms of a term that I keep seeing recently. And in this case it came
from Orlun, but I've seen it from others in game.
Either........
Argro
or 
Argo

.... as in, "Don't run too close to the mob, or he'll argo on you." or,
"We can't tank him. Maybe we should try argro kiting him."

Now obviously the word is aggro. And of course, anyone typing fast might
pop in an occasional typo, but some folks, friends of mine included, use
it consistently enough that it's got to be intentional.

Is this some new "EQ-Speak" that's come into the lexicon? I mean, lot's
of people couldn't spell rogue, and kept writing "rouge" instead to the
point where it's now used intentionally, even if only as a joke, when
speaking of rogues in a less than flattering light. 

There are other examples. But anyway, how is it in your server, guild,
group, etc. Are people all over realy saying "argo" or "argro" now when
they mean aggro?
