I've been adventuring with my 53 cleric on Tarew Marr for nearly a
year now, and I've noticed a change in the way people treat me in the
last few weeks.

I've only recently started grouping in the planes, and I find it both
enjoyable and a total nightmare on a modem -- zoning is insanely long.
I miss my DSL, let's just say that. But that's besides the point.

All my cleric's life, people have -always- donated for the symbols
when they ask for them. I'm not the type of cleric to cast a symbol
then demand reimbursal when they didn't ask for the symbol in the
first place. I would simply state that if they would like a symbol,
they would have to provide the peridot or 12 platinum pieces to cover
the cost.

But in the entire time I've been grouping in the planes, I have
received, at the most, two donations. This out of a high number of
groups, where the symbol was requested of me, and I informed them that
a donation would be required to cover the costs. They would say "ok",
I buff, but then they proceed to go about their business with no
reimbursal of any kind.

Is this a new trend, something that's regular of planes groups?
Because I simply cannot afford this. My corpse recently decayed while
I was moving across the country, and I didn't have a chance to
retrieve it, so I'm still completely on a GM legup kit, which is
mostly crap. I'm desperately trying to start rebuilding, but I find it
impossible when people refuse to donate, especially after they've
agreed to.

Am I just unlucky and finding all the assholes?
