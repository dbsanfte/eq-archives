Our guild is barely at a level to get epics for our folks. We have 13 so
far. Of that batch, six are druids, 3 are rogues. Take that as a
baseline. You can do the entire druid epic with three groups of people
(less than two if you're fairly high level with passable gear) in a
couple days. The rogue epic is nothing until you get to the General, and
if you get organized, that's doable by fairly low level guilds.
(Clarification: By "low level" I don't mean newbie guilds who's highest
levels are in the forties. I mean guilds that are decidedly non uber and
don't have a ton of 60+ with a bazillion AA and VT loot.)

Hardest? Warrior, Mage, and Necro are annoying as all hell and require
either extreme timing and luck or huge arse forces.
