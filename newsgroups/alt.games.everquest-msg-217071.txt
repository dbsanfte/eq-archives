One question - when did you originally go KOS?

They did cap how far down you could go a while ago - but they didn't reset
anyone below that cap.  So while the max KOS is neg3000, if you went KOS
before the cap and were down to neg7000, you have to work your way back up.
The max KOS cap just means you can't go lower than neg3000 if you start
going KOS now, and presumably if you're already below neg3000 you might not
be able to get any worse (though I wouldn't swear to it, depends on how it
was coded).

So if you're like me and did ten levels in Chardok before the max-negative
cap was put in, you've got one deeeep hole to dig yourself up.
