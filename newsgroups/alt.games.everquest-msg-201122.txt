I don't know about overpowered, I actually think they're pretty well
balanced at the moment.  Both Clerics and Druids have thier advantages,
(Evacs / better nukes vs Resurrections) which neither overlap nor have one
that is clearly superior to the other.


 In the low 40's healing downtime will become larger with any single healer
group.

KEI will stick to a level 45.  As in it can be targeted at them, and you
will not recieve the "buff is too powerful" response. A level or two lower
even, I think.

We did our 50's while Velious was out.  I was the first to 60, and that
happened about the first month of Luclin.  Our regular group was a Warrior,
Rogue, Enchanter, Druid.   Sometimes we were joined by another class or
two...  the occasional addition of a shaman, paladin, second rogue or
cleric. With only the Kunark spells, our druid was able to play main healer
for the entire time.   With clarity and then C2, we were able to continually
pull with little to no downtime pretty much everywhere.   Even at level 60
though, pretty much all of her mana had to go towards healing.

After the Incomplete Heals were added, not only was she able to play main
healer, but she also had mana left over to help nuke and DoT, even before
our enchanter got KEI.

With KEI now, she is every bit as good a healer as any cleric. Around the
second month of PoP we decided to prove it.  Four of us, Warrior, Paladin,
Druid and Enchanter-bot killed the Zelthniak in Umbral Plains.   The fight
took over 45 minutes, but she kept us all healed and going for the entire
time. (Even considering the Paladin died on the pull and had to run back
from Shadowhaven, loot his corpse, and then join the fight with the mob only
down to 80. ; )  )  Hell, theres not even many clerics I would attempt that
fight with.  Especially not then.
