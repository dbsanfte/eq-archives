I can't think of any I'd want to use all the time, but
once, when I died a long, slow death as main tank and never
once received a heal or even a message from the cleric,
despite several /gsays of "NEED HEAL!!", I sent the following 
as soon as I respawned at my bind point:

   /g  I'm sorry.  My fault.  I thought we had a healer.

It turned out my sarcasm wasn't too far misplaced -- we
later discovered that he was playing his twink on a second
computer and wasn't giving us his full attention.
