Being the owner of 3 dogs (2 female, one male), and two cats (1 male, 1 
female), something had to be done to prevent offspring.  In particular, 
one of the female dogs is the mother of the male dog, so, aside from just 
plain not wanting more puppies, it was quite desirable to not allow them 
in particular to breed.  I suppose we could have tried locking them up in 
seperate rooms during those times when it became necessary.

Breeding considerations aside, dogs tend to live longer if neutered.

Cats, particular if they are not indoor only cats, it is totally 
irresponsible not to neuter, as you have zero control over their breeding 
habits when they are not in the house.  Our cats are both in door cats, 
so that was not a consideration.  The cats we got from the local pound, 
and, you cannot get a cat that has not been neutered from them, so, you 
don't have any choice in that matter.
