I think the idea is that you form a group with other people of your race 
but other classes, who need other drops off the same mobs as you. 
Groups kill mobs faster for less exp per mob, which would mean the drop 
rate would be a lot higher per level, if you follow me.  And since you'd 
not be having to split the drops you need with anyone (nobody else in 
your group wants that drop), you'd be getting the drops 6 times as fast.

That quest has been in the game since before the first expansion, and 
every expansion has improved what people can get at any level of cash or 
effort, its not surprising that what was once a rare and desireable item 
is now a joke.

Many of us have observed that it would be nice if new expansions gave us 
ways to use the items gained in older expansions (or the original game) 
to make better gear... but so far the powers that be haven't adopted 
that scheme, with the exception of allowing us to turn in old style 
Planar armor for gems worth a few hundred pp.

The languages are fun from a roleplaying perspective, you don't -have- 
to not use them.  But since few do use them, you'll get a lot of funny 
looks.  You could try the Firiona Vie server, where there IS no common 
language... but even there, there's a defacto common, which oddly enough 
isn't Human as you might expect, but rather Elvish.  Learn that and you 
can talk to 95% of the people out there.  But at least other languages 
do see use there, and with the general understanding that even if you 
don't enjoy such things you -did- sign up for a "roleplaying prefered" 
server means you won't get nearly as much guff for doing so.

Yes, they fixed the practice runes so they work (at one point you 
literally couldn't get the drops for some parts) but not ever so that 
they are an economical use of time and effort.  Pity, but there you have it.

Hang out in SHar Val if you like chatty NPCs!

They say at least 50% of the quests in the game have never been found, 
so chatting with NPC's is not necessarily a bad idea; you might be the 
first to mention a trigger phrase just the right way, and puzzle out one 
of the hundreds of things that hundreds of thousands of others have missed.

Trick here is to move in till you have one targetted, then back way out 
away from them, decloak and see what you see.  "Con" isn't affected by 
range, if they like you, they do, if they don't, they don't.
