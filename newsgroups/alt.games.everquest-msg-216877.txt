That particular monk did just fine. And took much, much less damage
than she did when he was hit, he even tanked a couple while the SK was
afk. And, you know the whole harmony resist thing?

She didn't have or use canni5, she was regularly wincing and slowly
losing health. She did just that during that fight - one of the giants
gave her a few love taps and she didn't go below 40% health. We're not
talking a huge plummet here.

Wanderer's sylvan tunic casts Blessing of Replenishment, and she
already had it on her when she decided to recast it, while still
recuperating from a rez.

I heal pickup groups of varying consistency all the time. Her last
death was to a giant that hit me first and apparently fell in love
with her. She never cast slow, and my attention was on the tank, whom
I thought had pulled it off me. 8 seconds and a sandstorm later, she
was dead.

Clueless, no, but selfrighteously annoying enough that puller, healer
and tank all left the group at the same time.
