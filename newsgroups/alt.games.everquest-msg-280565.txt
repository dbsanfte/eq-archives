I actually think that would require more effort from my primary account. I 
would either have to actually type out a brief /tell, or sacrifice a hotkey 
for each seperate command. With the n52, all necessary macros can reside on 
the second account, and with 10 pages of hotkeys immediately accessible in 
that manner, I'll run out of button possibilities on the n52 before I run 
short of functional hotkeys.

I'm pleasantly surprised at just how well the n52 works for me.
