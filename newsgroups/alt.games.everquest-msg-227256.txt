Except I gave specific numbers here.  On a mob that was doing 55 DPS on
average, I was taking, at worst, 10dps less.  10 is NOT just 1% less
damage...it is 18% less.

How can I be overestimating when I give exact figures? O.o

That was the ENTIRE POINT of my post, that I actually had figures that
showed that it was actually helping.  That I wasn't just saying "oooohhh,
10ac and 3% looks pretty, it must be nice".

Now whether 18% less damage is actually useful in different situations,
that's the other argument.
