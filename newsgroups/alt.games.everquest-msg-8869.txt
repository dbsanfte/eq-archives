True, don't knock amd. I got an AMD Thunderbird 950 for 200, and a board
that can hold 2 gigs of mem for about 140. And I got a sweet deal on two 512
chips for 500.

I have had no problems with my amd processor. My laptops P3 650 ran faster
than the P3 800 I had in my computer.

Would have kept it if there was a druid around to cast wake of karana to
stop that thunderbolt hehe.
