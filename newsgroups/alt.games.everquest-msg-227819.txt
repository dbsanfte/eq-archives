Moo3 has already gone down in PC gaming history as one of the biggest
disappointments, ever. There haven't been many games that I looked forward
to more than this one, yet it's one of very, very few new titles that gets
bashed that I didn't even try out, it was bashed so bad. There were so many
better titles that came out at the same time (e.g., Galactic Civilizations)
that I didn't even miss it.
