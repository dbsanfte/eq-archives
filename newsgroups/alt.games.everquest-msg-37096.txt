Wrong, VI has already stated that they put the option to turn off the
inspection message in so people that are bothered by the message can turn it
off. This has been put to the test once already that I know of, where
someone kept inspecting another person, they reported it and the GM told
them to simply turn off the inspect message.
You see they have better things to do than to follow up on all the people
complaining about someone inspecting them.
