Zero chance of that being an exploit, as far as I can see. (Of course, the ways
of VI are mysterious and not known to man, so you're never 100% certain when the
"sploit" word is invoked.)  But in your case, you weren't exploiting pathing to
gain an unfair advantage, you were legitimately meleeing the mob down to the
point where it wanted to run, and not chasing him to avoid aggroing adds.  Also,
for an "exploit" to be something the GMs would care about, you would generally
have to be gaining something. True, you were gaining skill in weapons forms, but
you certainly weren't making any money, or even getting any xp until you
finished killing the gnoll. (Which you did legitimately.)  Raising a skill by
practicing it can't be an exploit, as I see it. (See Verant disclaimer above,
though.) Otherwise, if you jumped in a lake and swam for three hours to raise
your swimming skill without actually swimming *TO* somewhere, that would be a
'sploit also.
