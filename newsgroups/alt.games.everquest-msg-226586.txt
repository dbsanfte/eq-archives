My name is Rachel Ross and I am a tech reporter with the Toronto Star
newspaper. I'm writing an article about how people can "get a life"
online. I'm looking for one or two Canadian everquest fans to
interview about their experiences for the article.
Has the Internet (and Everquest specifically) brought new friends and
interests to your life? Do you balk at the idea that it is merely
distracting you from the real world?
If you are interested in being a part of the article, drop me an email
at rross AT thestar DOT com.
