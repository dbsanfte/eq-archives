	Actually, what I had in mind was making the entry to their
part of the adventure easy if you pay attention (I always hated
the "death due to invis dropping" crap because no matter how careful
you were there was no way to control it.)  Maybe a tricky path like
some of the paths in the DoN instances, lots of hidden pits and the
like, but essentially I'd like it to be easy to get to the "fun"
part where you get to kill monsters :-)

	One reason for my thinking is that I'm trying to make it
easy for real new players (as opposed to alts of skilled players)
to accomplish something.  I want to avoid a situation like the GoD
release, where groups would wipe twice just trying to run to the
zone they needed.
