    I LOVE Kaesora. I dragged two groups down there to do XP/drops at
different times, and they loved it too. Very fast paced, it almost forces
you to dungeon-crawl, and everyone comes out with at least a Pack and a
Tombcarver. I soloed all of level 44 in the Frenzied Spider room (first one
you come to if you drop down the right way) - picked up a Cryptrobber's
Knife for both my rogue friend and my rogue during that time, and some
Truesilver Sleeves (very underrated armour set, Truesilver).

    If faction is an issue, take the party to Church or Library. Once past
the spiders, there's no more mobs to give those hits. And it's not like
those two places are the weak parts of the dungeon.
