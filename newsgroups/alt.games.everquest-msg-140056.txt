Maybe they have changed it.  I only did this part of the Shawl quests about
a month ago.

One thing to note: The Death Squad giants were running slower than "normal"
giants - I aggroed the two giants who stand outside the courtyard when running
like a girl into Kael.  When I zoned in, the Death Squad were on the far side
of the courtyard, but the normal giants were half way across it.
