My personal demon occurs when playing caster or hybrid in combat, and you
just gotta cast that Heal/Frenzy/Whatever on yourself...

The easy way to do it is Tab, Alt-1, Tab. The wrong way involves holding
down the Alt key a little too long, giving you Tab, Alt-1, Alt-Tab --
dropping you immediately to the Windows desktop. While you're still meleeing
something dangerous. Sure, you can regain control of your char after you've
rebooted, and reconnected, and waited for the server to time out your
character, and relogged... What could possibly go wrong in all that time?

Verant has said they won't support Alt-Tabbing out of EQ. I just wish
they'd allow disabling it altogether...
