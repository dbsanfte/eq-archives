This is borderline cheating. Rather like saving and reloading diablo 2 
20 times when opening a treasure chest... to make sure you get a 'good 
drop'...

I agree there is a problem. I totally agree. But I don't think the 
menthod you describe is legitmate. Of course, I dont expect SOE to have 
   upped the drop rate at the same time they prevented us from 'upping' 
it on our own... but that's the solution we should be pushing for... not 
railing against this 'exploit-lock-down'.
