Or, spun the other way, they listened to thier customers and realized that
what they had been doing didn't make any sense at all.   Someone pointed out
that thier right hand didn't seem to know what the left was doing, and they
corrected that.

SOE stated publicly that they wanted rangers to be using dual 1 hand
slashers, and that they did not intend to return to a situation where bow
damage was superior to melee damage for rangers, because it was too hard for
them to balance the aggro on that much damage done at range.  Then, they add
the ultimate ranger weapon for this expansion.... and it's a bow.   Which
they just finished saying they didn't want rangers to use.

/boggle.

If rangers are supposed to be using two one hand slashers, then thier
ultimate weapons really should be one hand slashers.
