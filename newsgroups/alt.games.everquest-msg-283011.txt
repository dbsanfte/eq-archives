SK would be my choice if I decided to go with a tank class. My only concern 
there would be that with a tank class, I'm basically giving up a couple of 
the things mage pets offer - tanking and the nice DS of the fire pet. The 
pets would strictly be there for DPS at that point, which may not 
necessarily be a bad thing.

Speaking of tanking, just how effective can I expect the mage pet to be in 
this regard? Can they really manage it well enough to forego a tank class 
under the right circumstances?
