So, there I was, enjoying a beautiful stroll by the Sarnak Fortress, when
this Sarnak Recruit comes up and taps me on the shoulder.  I turned around
to ask him what he wants...maybe he thought I was lost and needed directions
or something.  I kindly said "Good day sir, may I help you?", and the
mannerless brute had the audacity to slap me.  Well, I was shocked, and took
a step back as if to say "I beg your pardon...", and this Goblin Warlord ran
up and struck out at the Sarnak Recruit.  I guess he witnessed the
altercation, and was as appalled at the recruit's actions as I was.

I sat down to re-lace my boots, and upon standing back up, the sarnak had
been knocked unconscious by the Warlord.  I walked over to express my
gratitude, and my new found friend turned on me !  I guess he was angry
because the recruit must have been newly stationed there and only had a few
copper on his person, and therefore decided that he wanted my Platinum Tiara
and Jaded Electrum Bracers.

Well, I had to work hard and scrimp and save for those (not to mention
living off of summoned bread and water, and foraged roots and such), so I
wasn't about to just give them up...especially to a filthy little Goblin.  I
called upon the powers of Tunare, and quickly dispatched the vile little
beast...shame he had such poor manners, all I wanted to do was thank him.

Oh well, I guess they will never learn...
