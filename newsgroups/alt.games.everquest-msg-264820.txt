<snip dismissive view of HO contribution to combat>

Ok, an update. As a Shaman, my role in combat has been primarily as a 
Buffer/Slower/Healer and usually with another healer in the group (two 
healers seems pretty common). Although I can solo pretty reliably at every 
location that I've hunted, I prefer grouping, and by a large measure.

Today, for kicks, I rolled a Fighter and went back to the Isle of Refuge to 
have a go at soloing my way through all the quests on the Isle (with the 
exception of the final encounter with the Orc boss,  which may require a 
group). I decided to take every opportunity to initiate a starter chain and 
then execute against the resulting HO. Wow, what a difference it makes using 
HO's in solo melee combat! The "beneficial effects" of my Priest HOs have 
seemed mostly obscured or irrelevant during grouping and they are much 
trickier to pull off in a group since you have to depend on others to not 
break the starter chain and then to follow up on the resulting HO. Here, 
however, I was able to control my destiny completely and I found the HO 
invaluable as a tool in battle. I found myself waiting for recast timers on 
certain combat arts so that I could execute the right sequences reliably. 
The result was some very nice bit of divine DD that topped off battles with 
a big Kaboom. Very fun.

Useful and fun as they are, the complaint remains that they are somewhat 
non-sensical and counter intuitive. My starting chain against the gobbo 
protectors on the Isle was a Kick, followed by a Wild Swing. Ok, fine. But 
then this brought up an HO wheel that could only be completed with a Taunt. 
Here I am fighting solo and I've initiated combat and gained massive aggro, 
and I have to follow this up by using Power to cast a Taunt? Oh well, the 
cost/benefit ratio is still very favorable, if somewhat wacky.

HO's are a strange little tool. For soloing melee they're fun and highly 
useful. Whether they wind up making a significant contribution in the group 
setting remains to be seen.
