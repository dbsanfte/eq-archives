Sorry, I didn't see that part of the question the first time around.

Your main hand should always be piercing, as you cannot backstab with
anything else.

For your off hand, I would *strongly* recommend that you train up both 1
hand slash and 1 hand blunt until they are both 200+ in skill.   For the
majority of your career, a second piercer will likely be a good choice, but
in the later game there is a definite lull of good Rogue usable piercers
around NToV / Luclin level. (1)  At the same time there are very good
multi-class offhands in both slashing and bashing.   You do not want to get
locked out of a very good weapon, because you restricted yourself to
piercing only for both hands.  Skill increases for your off hand happen, but
they're not frequent... I would hate to get a very good weapon at level 65,
then have to train up that skill from zero.   Other than that, pick your off
hand weapon based on the best ratio available, without reguard to damage
type.


(1) - The reason for this lull is that back in the day, Sony said they would
never release a rogue usable piercing weapon that was over 15 damage, since
the backstab damage from it would be too high, into the obscene damage
catagory.  They held to this limitation far longer than they do for most
others, (Only the amount of time that they held to the 41% max item haste is
comparable.) ... they broke it a tiny bit in Luclin by putting a 16 damage
piercer (I think) on one of the Ssra bosses, but it wasn't until Elemental
level PoP that they shattered it completely, with 16 and 17 damage piercers
becoming common.  And plane of time yields 20+ damage piercers, as it
should, to allow rogues to continue to compete with monks and rangers at
that level of gear.

But there is still a long period where 15 damage low 20's delay is the best
you can do for your piercer.
