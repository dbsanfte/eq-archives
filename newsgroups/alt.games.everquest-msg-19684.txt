It means that your name won't be changed if you are moving the
character to a different account on the server it is already on.
There is no risk of a name conflict in that case, so no possible need
to add an "x".

When you move your character to a *different* server, someone there
might already have the same name as your character, so your name gets
changed.

They have since said on the official message boards that you can
petition to have your name changed if you don't like the name with the
"x", so at least you can get some control over the new name.
