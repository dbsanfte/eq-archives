You'll lose a bit more wis, but little to no mana depending on other
upgrades (whether or not you're over 200 wis) and gain ac/saves with a
Diamond Wedding Band (1k on Tarew Marr)

The 40 hp on dusty soriz boots offsets ac loss a bit though.

Mana free is mana free....  I have 4 sec clicky level 5 root, and it's
surprisingly useful, granted, not so much for crowd control capacity though.

Brellium and Underfoot (and Mischevious) are the expensive kind that eat
BDs, Brellium is non imbued, Underfoot is Brell Imbued (adds 5 wisdom),
Enchanted/Imbued Dwarven Plate is the old cultural, enchanted is non-diety
restricted, Imbued is... Imbued, it definitely takes Brell and Bristlebane
imbues, not sure about anything else.
