From the shadows, the mysterious 42 <user@example.net> (if that IS his

Incorrect.

>ridiculous.

Yeah, why have any differential between players at all? Best if we
just dumb it down far enough that the 50 IQ halfwits don't NEED to
think anymore. After all, making them think discriminates against
stupid people, and we can't have that!


> Some things *should* be obvious. The ability to discern

>of those things.

And most players worth grouping with can do so without having to have
it handed to them.

Unfortunately theres those who can't, and of course they must whine
for these changes. Much better not having to think, much better when
they can just sit there and hit their attack hotkey, assuming it
hasn't been shorted out from the drool...

It's not hard to see where things will go if people like you get their
way. How about so you get a popup confirmation window if you
accidently do attack a mezzed mob? After all, you shouldn't have to
think about that either, right?

Why must you make these silly non sequiturs? Your argument have no
basis on its own merit?

No non sequitur for this?

Your inexperience with gaming outside EQ is irrelevent. Knowing what's
going on when you're grouping in EQ is part of what made it great, the
grouping "skill" so to speak. Situational awareness. Today's
generation, of which we must now assume you are the standard bearer,
doesn't want to be pushed that hard. Problems competing, perhaps?

I know people who understand arguments to the extent they can avoid
very poor comparisons, but you are not one of them. A better chess
comparison would be players being allowed to take computer chess
programs with them into tournaments so they don't make bad moves.
After all, it's not fair to those who aren't as good at chess, right?
The playing field should be level....
