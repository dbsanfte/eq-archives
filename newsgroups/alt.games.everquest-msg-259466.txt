Considering how they've been wrong about their own game mechanics
before, I was halfway persuaded you were right already :-P

If they'd gone back to the old 75% rule, then 48 would have been 
DB.  Instead they just made 15 levels the range from 60 to 65.

I wonder if it will stay that way in OoW, so 55 will be the new
LB/DB line?
