Was that a troll shaman with most of his starting points put into Stamina?
Or was it a nice sensible Vah Shir with his bonus points plugged into
Wisdom?  I deliberately build Paak to stand up to a beating, like taking an
Ogre warrior with all his bonus in stamina as opposed to a wood elf warrior
with all his points in strength.

My running point here is that shaman probably generally (and one designed
with HP and regen as prime factors even more so) make worse sponges than the
"tank" classes, but not as bad as the "DPS melee" classes.  And this might
change at higher levels as their dodge, parry, and Riposte skills improve
(assuming they do tank enough to keep those skills up) but up thru the low
20s I don't think those skills offset natural advantages enough to overcome
this hierarchy.

Its an interesting thought, one thats hard to prove one way or the other.
I've tried in this thread and elsewhere to detail reasons why I suspect your
guess is wrong: all things being equal the shaman will have more HP and will
have more HP regen, and won't negatively effect damage output nearly as much
by being in front of the mob.

OK, so you grant me that Tanks make better sponges than rangers do.  Is it
impossible to imagine that possibly shaman -also- make better sponges, absent
a Tank?

At any rate you miss my point here; for 65 levels, shaman sponge while
soloing, and "tank mez" adds while grouping.  Rangers avoid those jobs
whenever possible, their class isn't generally well designed to take a
beating.  Some well equippped rangers, particularly in the high 50s, will
dispute this, but I think if you question them more closely, you'll see that
they mean old world mobs while wearing gear they got on high level raids;
they are in a sense as twinked out as I am, and facing the equivalent of low
blues, not POP slice and dice machines.

Aha, terminology slippage again.

Tank not= sponge.

Sponge means absorb damage

Tank means absorb and dish out damage

DPS class means dish out damage.

Warrior, Paladin, and SK; tanks

Shaman (at least in this instance) Sponge

Rogue, Ranger, Monk; Melee DPS

When you use "tank" and "sponge" interchangably, you get funny arguements.

Rangers generally make great DPS and terrible Sponges.  My shaman makes a
great Sponge but a lousy DPS engine.  Neither of us are a Tank.  Together, we
can make a killing machine.

Perhaps an untwinked shaman would not make as good a sponge as an untwinked
ranger.  But thats a radically different question than whether rangers make
better tanks.

What interests me is, assuming both can soak up damage at about the same
rate, who has more HP, and what are the side effects of having them play MA?

I think the answer is "the shaman has more HP and has regen to offset some of
the losses" and "the shaman can't channel heals or DOTs as easily while being
beat on, versus the ranger losing melee DPS to dodge, parry, riposte, and
stun"

Since  I further postulated that the ranger could easily take aggro whenever
the shaman has to get a spell off, then I can't think of anything to
reccomend the ranger MA full time, given a rough equivalence in damage
mitigation.

To counter this arguement, you'd have to show that rangers actually take
substantially less damage per second from the mobs than the shaman does.
