Of course not.  You have nothing to offer them and you aren't high
enough level to have phat lewt to give them.

My main is a 45 druid.  He is typically anon (well, roleplay).  I
don't *like* being anon, I would prefer it if my friends could tell
where I am, so every now and then I experiment with taking it off.
Within 5 minutes the tells will start coming:  "Can you tp me plz?"
"Can you come pl me plz?"  "Can you keep me buffed and heal me while I
make level xx plz?"  The majority of the time there is no mention of
money whatsoever.

What the people who don't see what the big deal is don't seem to
understand is that it isn't just *you*.  Say I tp you and then go back
to my business.  Within 5 minutes, ANOTHER guy will want a tp.  And 5
minutes after him, another.  And so on.  If I were to tp everyone who
asks me for one, I literally would be left with no time to play the
game for myself.  Sorry, I don't play EQ to spend my *entire* time
online helping others and getting no experience for myself.  You
wouldn't either.

I will help people out sometimes.  Usually, it's the ones who ask
politely and seem to have a real need.  You don't NEED a tp from BBM
to WC (unless for some reason you can't take the boat).  You don't
NEED a SoW for corpse retrieval.  They're conveniences for you.  Too
often, the people who want these conveniences don't mind at all
inconveniencing the person handing them out.

I also have a warrior, and he never asks for anything, other than a
bind near where he's fighting.  When I do ask for binds, I'm always
careful to include how much I'm paying in my request.  As an aside, my
druid will almost always bind anyone asking for it, free of charge.
Binds are important.

> i believe the whole "Can i have SoW please?"  "yea sure type /d so i can
>wipe you out" is way over the top.

I haven't seen a thread like that.  I have absolutely no problem with
people asking for SoW if they're standing right in front of me (and
I'm not in the middle of a fight), and I don't expect any payment for
it.  SoW at this point is very, very cheap, I don't even see any
movement on the mana bar when I cast it.  Don't expect me to run all
the way across the zone to SoW you though.

It's the *time-consuming* requests you want to be careful of.  Don't
ask me to come pl you; don't (I really hate this one) drag 3 or 4 mobs
you can't handle right up in front of me and start fighting them,
expecting me to keep you healed and buffed and save your sorry butt.

I guess all I'm saying is try to envision the impact of your request
on the person granting it.  If it results in a fair amount of time
when *he* won't be able to do what he wants, then you need to at least
offer payment and accept a refusal graciously.
