I was factioning in Nurga on a 65 paladin and noticed I was 
actually racking up some decent aa xp on the light blue 
stuff...so I got aaxp and faction for the chardok quests which 
made me happy, and I got drops from the named that popped that I 
used as tribute fodder. I had fun. there were a couple of groups 
in there at different times that were upper 40s groups and they 
got brells popped on them, so they were happy, and when i boxed 
in my 56 cleric for the faction, they also got temped. In 
exchange I got a few stacks of death salts and goblin skin, ir 
healing support for going after a few named that might have 
crippled them. Ah, also I popped off a few rezzes over the weeks 
I spent there=)

I know if I am in a lower level zone for something I try to make 
sure that the people who can get the exp there because they are 
the right level get first crack at things. I am patient, I can 
wait for another spawn, and if I get a drop that is part of a 
quest, I try to see if someone needs to loot it, especially if it 
is a no drop I cant otherwise use and would rot. I was really 
pissed off at the person who wanted 5k pp to let me loot a 
pearlescent shaard for my cleric epic. That asshat got put on my 
ignore list immediately! A cleric epic can do nothing but help 
others, it isnt a self buff, it isnt anything other than a basic 
rez to get groups and people back in zone and ready to loot fast.
