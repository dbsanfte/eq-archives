I think he's a bit confused and you got the wrong impression of what he was
asking.
He wants a "new" Free Move to Euro servers, not back to a US one, thinking
that he won't be paying VAT on the subscribtion because it will already be
figured into cost. I don't think this would be the case as surely all
subscribtions are paid to SOE in the US and therefore subject to VAT. If a
UK based company was handling subscribtions I would assume they would
already be paying more due to VAT already being added.

Well, at least in the NG someone will take notice of your complaints...In
either case nothing will be done about it but it's nice to be heard :ï¿½)

Hopefully soon some of these ppl will realise it is not down to SOE to do
anything about this.
