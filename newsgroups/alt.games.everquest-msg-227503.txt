For most classes, it isn't a race.  But for the Tanks, it is.  What you 
are missing is the tank perspective; each target needs one person to 
stand in front of it, keep aggro, and take the beating.  Who gets that 
job?  The one with the best tools to handle it.  This is where knights 
have bumped ahead of warriors and why there's so much gnashing of teeth 
over the issue; but class differences aside, its also a question of 
gear.  If you have two warriors, but one has better hate producing 
weapons, better AC, higher HP total, better resists... well, in short if 
one is significantly better geared, then he gets to do most of the tanking.

I'm sure you've seen this in groups, when there are two tanks, the 
question "whats your AC and HP" gets asked, and generally that settles 
things.  A less well equipped tank can always look for groups where he's 
the only tank, though, so its not as bad as it could be.  But in a raid 
situation, where your guild typically fields half a dozen tanks, he's 
always in competition.  If he's less well geared, then the only reason 
he ever gets the MT job is out of pity, and never on the really hard 
"we've never killed this before" targets that really light up a tank's life.

If you aren't MT, then you are second string, a benchwarmer who only 
really steps up to the plate when the MT dies... and then there's still 
a hierarchy, ST, TT, QT... how far down the list are you?  And since you 
aren't as well geared as those ahead of you, and the healers aren't as 
prepared to heal you as they were for the first couple, your only hope 
of living is that perhaps the situation has changed; the mobs is now 
slowed or crippled or the adds are dealt with or something.

FOr support classes, this isn't nearly as big a deal.  My cleric was 
mildly envious of those wearing 15FT and a full set of focus gear, but 
only mildly, his CHeals and fast heals did much the same job, much the 
same way, and he didn't have to compete in groups for who would heal, 
and in raids clerics stack well regardless of gear.

My mage is generally in the same boat; he does damage, lots of it, plus 
provides off tanking as needed.  I do recall a group where one of the 
tanks had a weapon that procced (frequently, presumably she also had 
255dex worth of gear to power it) a 420 dd or something like that when 
my best nuke was around 260, I felt pretty silly working that hard for 
less effect than she was getting because she had a weapon worth 100K or 
so... but it didn't affect my ability to do my own job.

For most, not much, other than the creeping sense of relative 
uselessness that someone proccing away at 420 a pop might cause... but 
for warriors, paladins, and Shadowknights, someone buying their way to 
near top end gear with RL cash means buying the ability to actually get 
the job their class is designed for.

Oh, and not only to get the job, but top end buyable gear will result in 
top end drop only gear; if you are the best tank your guild has, in any 
system that's award driven, you are going to get all the gear that 
upgrades you.  It doesn't make sense to give the tank with 1200AC and 
4500hp an item that will make him a better tank when you have another 
tank with 1500AC and 8000hp who is going to be the one doing the job. 
Tank B gets the high aggro weapons because you -want- him to take aggro, 
not Tank A.  Tank B gets the stuff that raises his AC because he's the 
one who's going to have aggro anyway, not tank A.  Same with the HP, the 
attack boost, so on and so forth.  The guild will benefit more from 
gearing up their "real" tank than from sharing the gear out among the 
second stringers.  Many guilds don't operate this way, but some do, and 
all the Johnny Cash warrior has to do is find the ones that do.
