Looking at this last sentence, it is saying that you should get good
enouggh regeneration if you drink of a level lower than you level as
long as it is close - if you are much higher than it then you should
use the next level higher than your level.  This would imply that the
30 or the 40 drink is good for a level 31 character.

The level 30 drink is best for people at level 30 or less and the level
40 is best for people at level 40 or less.  As you are greater than 30
but less than 40 I would say that the level 40 drink is an improvement
over the level 30 drink.

This, and the rest of the excerpt, say to me that the level 40 drink
will give you more regen than the level 30 drink but that the amount of
increase may not be enough to warrant the greater price.
