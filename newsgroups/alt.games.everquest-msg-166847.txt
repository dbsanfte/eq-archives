Dunno where you have that from, but I have _NO_ problems with quadding
at lvl 31. I had _ONE_ resist on "Snare" in 2 levels and that was on a
single target, so I could root and resnare. If you have SoW you can
easily run away and retry when snare resists. I have good gear for a lvl
31 Wizard and I can do around 2-3 Quads per manabar on Rockhoppers
(Luclin Mobs have more HP than oldworld mobs).
  The SoTF quest you are right... took me 4 days with my Highlvl
beastlord to get all components. But it is possible to solo without.

If Mana is that Problem, you can still single kite. Pull single with
snare, resnare if resisted and than use your singletarget nukes.

I must say... Wizards are easy to lvl from 24 since Luclin came out.
Esp. with the Bazaar, every Wizard should have enough Mana/Int Gear to
do 1 Quad at lvl 30. With 34 things changes, when the first AE comes
with a good ratio.
