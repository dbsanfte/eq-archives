I will give you my opinions of how Final Fantasy would meet your 
requirements. Since EQ and FF are the MMOG's I've put a major time 
investment in, (I puttered around in SWG, but I can't recommend it to 
anyone... just too messed up).

Final Fantasy Soloablity: 1, maybe 2 out of 5. A few classes are 
'reasonable' soloers, mainly Beastlord (an advanced job) and Red Mage (A 
kinda do it all that can tank, do damage, heal)

Final Fantasy sometimes falls flat on quests, sometimes scores big. Even 
though you are doing the same thing everyone else is, the cutscenes 
often give you a 'You are special for doing this' feel. The mission 
system leads you through the game's storyline, while the other quests 
either help it along or explain backstory. Most quest rewards, while not 
phenomenal, are worth doing the quest for.
3.5 out of 5 (I've never seen a 5 out of 5)

Unfortunatly, I have a fairly balanced 'static party', consisting of a 
tank, healer, buffer/debuffer, and 3 damage dealers, so we don't try 
much in the way of radical tactics. Most pickup groups are concerned 
with min/maxing so much (to the point that they want to wait for a pally 
tank instead of getting the war, even though the war is 95% as good) 
that they don't bend much on tactics either.

However, I will say our group, by playing smart and being flexible has 
done things that I can easily find 20 people to tell me are impossible.
(Example mission 3 dragon. We've (my party) have killed it repeatedly 
with 4-6 people (for various friends, aquaintinces, and people begging 
in the square), and only once with a black mage to 'sleep' one of the 
two mobs. Yet I get told everytime I try to help someone with it that 
'it can't be done without a blackmage', I had a 74th level character 
tell me he's done it  many dozens of times, and every time they had no 
blm they wiped. )

Most monsters have strengths and weaknesses based on their base types 
(boss mobs are an exception). Few will change as you go through the 
levels. Skeletons are resistant to dark spells, and weak against light 
spells, and this has applied since the level 3 skellies that come out at 
night in the newbie zone to the level 45 skellies we are fighting in the 
Necropolis.
I can't confirm that this doesn't change later, I'm only half way 
through the levels (and about 1/4 through the xp I need to earn.)
I could however see where the monster fighting aspect of the game could 
get old quickly in FF.

UO - Had to be mentioned. Wouldn't play it on a bet.
DAoC - claimed by many to be 'EQ done right'.
FFXI - Definatly not for everyone. No free trial either (aside from the 
month you get for buying the basic box, which comes with the first 
expansion).
Ashron's Call (I'd stay far far away from AC2 though... worse than SWG)
Anarchy Online... in fact.. sec
http://community.anarchy-online.com/content/news/articles/8387L
They are giving you a free year to try it out (the basic game, no 
expansions)
I enjoyed the betatest for Jumpgate: TRI a couple of years ago, but it's 
a tiny game from what numbers I've heard (less than 10000) and is not 
exactly a traditional game. It did not however grab me enough to pay for 
it. Free trial iirc.

P.S. If you want to be not entirely lost and having to find yourself in 
FF if you start playing, let me know before hand and I'll pick up a 
worldpass for Odin for you, and I can answer questions on the sometimes 
slightly odd way they do things.
