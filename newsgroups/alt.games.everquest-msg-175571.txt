Just be very careful to keep him stunned because he can cast an AoE. If
he does, he'll aggro the warders on the other side of the big door. They
need to be mezzed, ST'd, rooted, or whatever, otherwise you risk them
KSing the PP on you and this is A Bad Thing (tm).  Of course, then
anyone on the warder's hate list has to zone right after the fight, but
that's not a biggie.
