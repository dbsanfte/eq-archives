Well level 40 should do. Most of my guild is under 60, so a 40th level
warrior can group with them. From there I should be able to level up
quickly enough to start closing in on them. With a 55th level Shammy
PLing him, I should be able to make it soon. Of course, I'm looking to
make mid 50's after not too long.

>Maybe its easier to recruit a warrior.

We've tried. Not too many warriors running around. I have only grouped
with 2 in the last 55 levels. =( A troll and a DE. One was really
good, but was snatched up before we could get our guild going and the
other sucked. Actually our guild leader actually said he's considering
stopping trying to recruit warriors and get another cleric, and he
would start a warrior instead. He already has a Monk alt though, and
on FV you have to have an account for each alt. I have been thinking
about getting a warrior or Pally or SK alt to 2box with. So it made
sense for me to do so. This will make "soloing" a lot easier.
