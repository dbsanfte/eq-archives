I joined the Illuminati, myself. I guess that keeping the status quo 
seemed like the least bad option to me. I haven't even bothered playing 
the scenario that leads to a new Dark Age, that one is just flat out

I'm playing it again now, to see how the plot develops if you keep Paul 
alive. I'm sure there must be a plot branch somewhere involving Sandra 
Renton, but I'm not sure how to trigger it.
