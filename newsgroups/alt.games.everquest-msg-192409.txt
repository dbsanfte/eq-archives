 I didn't get to pull a whole lot the past few days but I could have
sworn spells were not breaking feign as well. I suppose it's possible
the casters I was pulling were casting short range spells.

 Really I could go both ways on whether it should be a 100% mem-blur or
not. There's advantages to each in certain areas.

the RZ issue was very common though.
