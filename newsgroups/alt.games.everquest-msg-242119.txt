   Thank you, Andrew.  I have already written this section.  I will post what I
wrote, and see if anyone weighs in on which they feel is a better fit with the
FAQ.

Mine:

6.7   Q:  I've joined too many channels and now the text is flying by too fast! 
What to do??/How do I open multiple chat windows?

A: Right click on the black bar of your main main chat window where it says
"Main Chat".  The second option down on the list is "New chat window.  Left
click on that to bring up your new chat window.  Your new chat window will
appear over the top of the main chat window, and can be drug to another location
and re-sized if you wish.  If you wish to change the transparency level of your
new window, open up the menu for the new window by right clicking on its title
bar, then hover the cursor above the first option, "Window"  This will show
another drop down menu.  Hover the cursor over "Alpha", then select faded level
by left clicking.  You will get a box to enter a value of 0 to 100.  0 will make
the box, but not the text, completely transparent, 100 will make the box and
completely opaque, and 50 will make it semi-transparent.  In the same menu, you
will see a filters option.  By selecting this, you can choose what sort of text,
including chat channels, you want to go into your new window.
