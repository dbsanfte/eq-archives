The bet on the street is that the GeForceFX won't be dropping anytime soon
because they have so much extra hardware (the stupid thing takes up 2 slots,
because of it's cooler, uses DDR-II ram, the board layout is expensive,
etc).

http://www.tomshardware.com/graphic/20030127/index.html

list is $399.
The only advantage you have is that card makers are competing not only
against the 9700pro, but each other. So it may drop. It couldn't hurt to
wait a few weeks.
