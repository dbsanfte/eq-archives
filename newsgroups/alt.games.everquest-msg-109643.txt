But some people ARE more important than others.  The President of the
United States is damned sure more important than I am, and he should
think exactly that.  

To pull another contrived situation out of thin air, given a situation
where the President is forced to decide if he can save his self from
whatever, or save me, he damned well better understand that his life
is more important than mine.

So evil has nothing to do with intent?

Please.  To use the word 'evil' to describe something like that is
like using the word 'love' to describe my feelings for Taco Bell's new
7 layer nachos.  Just using it there diminishes the meaning of the
word to the point of making it trivial.

Evil is a something that, to my mind, is Big.  Evil requires intent
and understanding.  Being petty doesn't cut it in the Evil game.
