Follow your own argument here .. no new engine just a port to DX9.

No, as is typical with multi-nationals they want the best of both world
which is why they touted the game passes which give access to all games.

Far to simplistic

No, the interesting thing about EQ1 is that the guild system built it
and the guild system is killing it .. that is the conundrum.

Not a whole lot of players have spent any time in GoD because it is
some complex and remains to be so even after the patch .. spurious
comment.

Well it had to be done but not necessarily with EQ1.  What is is
showing is the MMORFG players are slower to embrace technology change
than their other gaming fellows.

What communication?  They are talking to uber-guild players .. what
type of communication is that when the mnajority of the player base is
not there?

Ah a failure of the Test server ... could not disagree there .. devs
with heads up their own backsides ... now that is the problem with this
game techs dictating content to a player base.

Now you are getting close.
