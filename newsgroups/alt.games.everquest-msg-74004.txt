AC determines how likely the hit is to get through and hurt you. Every
bit counts, but 65pp for a 4ac boost is too much.

Keep your money for banded. Runs about 1-2pp per AC on most servers.

However, at level 11 chainmail and leather is doing pretty well. What
you want to do right now is go to the Warrens. You'll accomplish three
things there:

1) You'll get lots of experience (BIG exp bonus there) and earn
faction with both Paineel and Erudin.

2) You'll acquire kobold molars. Turn these in to the paladin's guild
in Erudin (the Deepwater Knights). You'll not only get great
experience and more faction, you'll get a random piece of ringmail
about every fourth molar. Your mileage may vary, but I never got a
duplicate for a piece that I was already wearing so I ended up with
almost a full suit of ringmail from kobold molars.
If you're already wearing something better then the ringmail sells for
a good price.

3) You'll earn great money. Keep EVERYTHING and sell it. It adds up
fast, especially as you level up and move deeper in. I've literally
waddled out of the Warrens with 30-40pp worth of loot at one time or
another.

Good luck!
