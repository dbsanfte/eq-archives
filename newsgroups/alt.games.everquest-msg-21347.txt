I've put one guy on my list.  I was playing my alt character, a 6th level
Ranger, when this punk comes up and inspects my character without asking,
and screams "cheater."  I ask why, he says because I twinked.  The answer is
no, that one fine day a 45th level Bard came to the Qeynos gate and said,
"hi cute Ranger."  She asked if I had been playing long and said awhile, but
that this was my alt character.  She said bring me the other, so I got out
Faazdaan.  She said bring back the Ranger, whose name is Waveryn, and then
gave him about five major items for his personal protection.  The bard's
name was something like Mehry Melodies.  Anyway, this 12th level druid
starts screaming about me being a cheater, which isn't true.  Finally I just
used the ignore switch.  I was in the right place at the right time.  This
is a magic land, right?

Waveryn
