Actually I got the impression that it was more of a joke.  Kind of a "nobody
could be stupid enough to believe this" thing...  and then he posts the names
of the idiots who actually sent him e-mail.

"Satisfied Viewers Gordog, Seridion, Celistia, Sajicelessii, Laerisos, and
Eladron. Your name could be here just e-mail me!"

Even the name of the post implies that it is a joke.   "Laugh at this one."
