I ran TOTI then my free month on a bargain bin copy of EQ2 but I got 
terrible frame rates and it was nearly unplayable. Think I only survived 
because I played a conjurer and my pet did most of the fighting.

I don't mind playing at 1024*768 and Very High Performance if only I get a 
frame rate where I can actually control what I am doing.

I have a Dell as follows
2.8GHz P4 with HT
1GB RAM
Intel 910GL SMA Graphics.

The obvious culprit is the graphics, but I can't afford to spend very much. 
If I get say a 7300GS with 128 or 256MB of onboard memory will that make 
enough difference? .Or what specs would I need to just about get by?

[I live in the UK - in case you want to recommend your favourite cheap 
hardware store :-)]
