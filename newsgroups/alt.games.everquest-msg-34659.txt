But there are names that if the person is affable enough can be
overlooked.  Stormmaster, Thundor,  Enchantor, Dear, Aristotle, or
Autumn . All examples from my server, who I know to be competent players
and decent Persons.  names that get the Moron treatment  Stryddderrr, 
Gaaanadaallllf,  Redhededbiotch, etc.
