INT casters can only use a weapon in their primary hand. And unfortunately,
this particular tome can only be equipped in that hand. I ran into the same

You'll have to forego your melee attack while equipping the tome. Which is
ok, but at level 6 make sure you're taking time to develop your piercing and
1H Blunt as well.
