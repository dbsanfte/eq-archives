Actually, so far, the only posts I have seen in this thread are bizbees, and
yours.  The others so far have been, thankfully, based on past posts, KFed.
And, no, I did not KF them because they dared to attack Bizbee, I do not
have you KFed.  I KFed them because they are idiot trolls with nothing to
contribute to the newsgroup.
