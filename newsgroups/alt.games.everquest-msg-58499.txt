I stand corrected. He did say "hp buffs" specifically, which I missed.
We don't waste reagents on low threat mobs, so we only use one of the
specific hp buffs. The other one is non-hp giving, but it's still a nice
buff. (resolution and armor in this case). And you can stack resolution
with armor and symbol. We do it in tougher fights, and then, yes, my HP
is closer to the 3K mark.
