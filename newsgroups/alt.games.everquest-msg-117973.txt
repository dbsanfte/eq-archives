As others have said there is a symbol on the wall you can click
on to teleport you out. The nice thing is it teleports you to just
outside the bank. Great short cut when coming in from TS.

The symbol is below the water line on the outside wall just to the
east of the TS zone.

As far as there being anything in the moat I saw 1 minnow in there
once. I tracked it, killed it and it just disappeared. No body, no message
of death at all. It would be a great place for a Sea Monster of some sort
though. =)
