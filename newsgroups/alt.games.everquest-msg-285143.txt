Hi All

Saw this today:

"In our continued efforts to combat cheating in World of Warcraft,
more than 76,000 accounts were closed and 11 million gold was removed
from the game economies in Europe, Korea, and the US in the month of
September. The closed accounts were associated with activities that
violate World of Warcraft's Terms of Use, such as using third-party
programs that allow cheating, and farming gold and items. These types
of activities can severely impact the economy of a realm and the
overall game enjoyment for all players."

Sheesh - 76,000 accounts shut down for cheating!  I don't know what
the subscription fee is per month, but that's got to be a lot of
money!

I just wish Sony would do something similar, but they won't.
