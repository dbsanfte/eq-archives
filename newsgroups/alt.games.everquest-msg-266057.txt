Your case has never been proved, you just keep asserting that it has.

No definitions or rules other than the ones Cryptic sets are valid. 

Your expectations are irrelevant, this isn't EQ and it doesn't have the
rules and conventions EQ has.

Your case has been "proved" only if you consider someone trying to play
Chess using the rules for checkers or Go valid.

You having a character with a french name may "annoy" people too, but
they can't make a valid complaint because french names aren't against
the rules.

If it annoys _YOU_, then it's _YOUR_ problem.  If it's against the rules
of the game, then it's the Dev's/GM's/CS's problem

No, they think harassment is a problem.

As i've said before, and you conveniently always snip out, following
someone around and HEALING them, or BUFFING them, or other things that
are WHOLLY BENEFICIAL to the recipient is harassment if the recipient
DOES NOT WANT IT and has stated he does not want it.

But then you've already stated that you would prefer it if random people
couldn't help you at all.

Too bad that's totally against the theme and mechanics of the game.

You're insisting that the devs, GMs and customer support deal with you
"concerns" about things that aren't against the rules.
You are one of a tiny minority

You aren't the playerbase, but you're insisting that YOUR definition is
the only correct one.

There is ample evidence that a tiny minority of the playerbase's usage
of the word exceeds the dev's definition of it.

As stated before, Forum posts about kill stealing are a tiny minority.
Complaints over broadcast and request channels are a tiny minority.

If the playerbase followed YOUR definition, Forum posts and chat
complaints about kill stealing would be at epidemic proportions.

But they aren't, nor have they ever been.

I don't have to put words in your mouth, you've posted your opinions and
your utter contempt for what the rules and conventions of this game are.


I quote you from one of your past replies:

"Remember that I don't care how 'CoH defines' it I'm really only
concerned about how I define it, and since my definition is consistent
with 'player convention' I'm not being unreasonable defining it that
way."


You don't care how it's defined in CoH you're only concerned with how
you define it.  And you assert, without any kind of proof, that your
definition is the one the playerbase holds.

You make it clear in another post that you want the GMs to treat
complaints about things that aren't against the rules with questions,
logging of your complaint, and statistical tracking of those complaints
vs other characters.

You want customer support to address the concerns of, and provide
support for, people who are no longer customers.

In short you have a set of totally unreasonable desires that if followed
would result in either 
1) a huge shortfall of GMs and customer support being available for
VALID complaints and bug problems, or 
2) a large increase in staffing to be paid for by increased monthly
fees.

I think I probably speak for the majority of CoH players when I say
"Fuck you and your unreasonable expectations.  I'm not willing to pay
extra so you and your ilk can get special treatment."

If you don't like the rules of CoH and how things are done in CoH,
LEAVE.
