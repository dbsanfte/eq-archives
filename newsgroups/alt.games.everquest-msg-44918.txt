I was under the impression that the off hand attack was totally separate
from the primary, and the only thing making it hit less often was the fact
it had to make two successful skill checks rather than one? Primary hand
makes skill check against weapon type only (1HB/2HB/1HS/2HS/Piercing/HtH),
while off hand first makes a check against Dual Wield skill, and then if
successful against weapon type skill. The Dual Wield skill check is not
linked to a successful primary hand attack first, but rather to the weapon
delay timer like the primary hand.

I may be wrong, but this is my understanding of the situation.
