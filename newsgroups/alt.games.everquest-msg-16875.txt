It makes me more comfortable to realize that I'm not being thin
skinned over how things went.  I do understand when it is time to "get
the hell out of Dodge" that casters would gate if able, rather than
run across a hostile zone.  During the fight was purely pitiful.  It
was a full group, one warrior died... the rest of us made it out
alive.  What made me so damn mad was that the warrior died trying to
get the giant off her sorry behind, and she gated out.
