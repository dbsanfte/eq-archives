We spent two hours there last night killing in South and East without seeing
one drop.    It was the Paladin's second trip there yesterday as well... so
probably more like 5+ hours for him.  Not one drop in that time.   Probably
just bad luck, as our rogue friend thought they were common when he went in
the first few days they were added...but still.

Part of Meemer's problem was that he didn't have a master key, and had to
camp the bosses of north and west before he could even get to the area where
they dropped.   That probably ate a few hours.
