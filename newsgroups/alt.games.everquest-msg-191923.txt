Hmmm, that wasn't my intent. My intention wasn't to "jab" at your
point. I merely used it as a platform to offer my view on the reasons
behind the desire to break the rules. I simply see it a different way.
I don't think it is arrogance, as much as it is laziness and "popular"
to buck the system (or rather any system) among the immature masses.

Fundamentally we both agree, so no real need to belabor the point.
