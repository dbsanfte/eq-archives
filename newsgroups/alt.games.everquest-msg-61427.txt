<snip buy-low-sell-high advice>

The other day I won a FBSS after my 4th or 5th Frenzied camp with
my alt rogue.  Coming through EC  (which wasn't busy in the morning),
I saw a level 10 warrior auctioning that he was buying one for 8K pp,
and knowing that the "normal" price on my server is around 6Kpp,
I sold it to him.  Bought a pair of Silver Chitin Handwraps, that I planned
on using. Logged off in EC.

Came back on to somebody offering 9K for the Handwraps, so I sold
'em.  Along comes a guy selling a Serpent's Tooth (13/27  piercer that
is rogue usable), willing to talk trades but wants plat.  I pay him 8Kpp
for the Tooth, sell the tooth to another rogue for 14Kpp ("Hey, it's
better backstabs than that Jagged Ice Shard and it's from the Hole,
so it's really rare") and the trade of his JIS.  Take the plat and
buy a set of Silver Chitin Handwraps, and a Sebilite scale BP and
legs and have some left over.

Spent all of about 3 hours in /auction and significantly upgraded
my damage abilities and my armor.  Got in trouble with the wife for
staying up late, but I'll be happy when I hit Hate Saturday I just
know it :-).
