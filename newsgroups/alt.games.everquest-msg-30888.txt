Aside from all the other, obviously incorrect blather here.  WK is the
closest port spot, not NK, just takes a wizzie to get there.  I didn't see
where he requested a druid as opposed to a wizzie port.  Others have already
corrected the other mistakes in your post.  But, what the heck.  I have a le
vel 22 warrior, and I still solo with him when I feel like it.  I expect I
can continue doing so for a few more levels.  Most of the time I group with
him.  Everfrost has a wide variety of levels of mobs depending on where in
Everfrost you hunt.  You can even find mobs to hunt at level 11 that will
give xp in the strictly newbie part of everfrost.

Oh, I get it, you meant that you are idiot number 3.  Sorry, I misunderstood
your post at first there.
