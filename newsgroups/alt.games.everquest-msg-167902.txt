Try out this one....

Magician,Magician, Magician, Magician.

:) myself and 20 other mages, along with 2enchanters  and 1 cleric  for when
things went wrong to rezz during battle, and a monk to pull. raided SEVERAL
places. Kael, Plane of sky, etc...

an all mage group is very powerful
also, you can drop 1 of the mages out for a druid, they nuke pretty good
too,  and also cant port, heal, regen, and buff nicely.
