*wonder who Drumman is*

I always called them shadr00ds myself, but I'll remember drumman from now
on. :D

Damn right (GEBS on a shaman makes Baby Cazic Thule cry...sorry James, had
to steal that one)...and another note for the OP...once a (good) shaman
has Canni, they don't med.  Ever.  They dance, but they don't med.  Once
you have canni, ask a knowledgeable shaman to teach you to dance, because
I know that for a shaman with their med skill capped and without
torpor/quiescence it is something like an extra 20 mana/tic.

<---- doesn't play a shaman, just has to live with one
