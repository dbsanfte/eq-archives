I like this quest. It's  for "experience twinking" and the loot ain't that bad.
The one bottleneck seems to be the giant wasp wings; my newbies can find half
the components themselves off of spiderlings and fire beetles, and the rest is
easily available off of merchants.

I like the bracer of beetlekind mainly (at my level) for the strength boost. It
is difficult enough being a halfling smith :-) My halfling rogue loves his
silver bracelet and has been holding on to 2 bottles of spider venom, just
waiting for an opportunity to use it.
