As a few people have posted here...  Your observations need a little more
information to give you a much better picture before reasoning anything.

Sometime, try and find a recent map of the Internet nodes.  Being as I
connect in California...  Here is a traceroute to portvista.com:

The first 4 hops negated because they pertain to my lan and you guys don't
need to know where exactly I am.  Suffice it to say...  Portvista's ISP is
based near Georgia...  as the attga.ip.att.net suggests.  Notice that there
is about at least 7 hops before Portvista reaches California.  That means 5
to 6 possible places for the net to screw you over, that your ISP or Verant
has no control over.  At least 3 of those places, it can affect more than
just your ISP to screw over quite a few dozen people, for instance...
dlstx.ip.att.net...  That would be Texas.  If a large percentage of South
East America goes through this texas router...  Well, a large percent of EQ
players will suffer some net burpage there too.

Now mind you... I've been around before Quake made internet gaming REALLY
popular.  Before that, MUDs and such were a big thing, text based
everything.  And this problem has existed then, and still exists now.  So
the notion of Verant milking people with LD is like saying the your parents
are milking you of your own money when you were a kid with a job.

Take the time to learn a little more about the internet sometime.  Just
cause you have a connection to a server, doesn't mean it is 100% foolproof
all the way down.  And btw, a Quake/CS/FPS type game server...  Is not
always hosting 30+ other servers that house over 2k people banging on the
connection at the same time...  So just cause Quake works fine, doesn't
mean that server is trying to deal with over 8k people at the same time.
Just food for thought.
