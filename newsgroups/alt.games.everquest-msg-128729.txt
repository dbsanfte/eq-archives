what about the isreali occupation and oppression that has driven the
palestinians to suicide bombings?  Suicide bombings are wrong anyway you
look at it, but you have to see the motives behind them.  Suicide bombing
this, suicide bombing that... what about the thousand+ palestinians that
have died becuase of isreali oppresssion?!  As horrible as it sounds, Isreal
has commited the bigger crime, and we're pointing fingers at the
Palestinians.  Quit watching one media source!

i don't give a shit what happened before.. that is IRRELEVENT at this
point.. what is relevant is how people are being treated NOW.

inform yourself!
