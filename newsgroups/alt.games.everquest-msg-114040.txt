Here is a word to add to your vocabulary..."DENIAL"

That is the state you are currently living in. 

If you have a chronic LD problem, then there is something wrong with
your PC or your ISP. 

End of story

Quit EQ if you like, but don't lay the blame are Verant's feet. Out of
400K+ subscribers, and all of the people who post to this group, you
are one of only a handful who complain of a chronic LD problem. Think
about it.
