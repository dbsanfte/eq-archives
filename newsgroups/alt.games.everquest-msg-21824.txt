I had a hard time getting rid of my Iksar Beserker Club. Two other people
were selling them in EC at the same time I got mine. I started out at 4Kpp,
and wound up selling it for 2Kpp in cash, a springwood club (that my druid
uses) and a cleric tunic. At least I got some cash for it!

I don't recommend the camp as a way to get rich, for sure!
