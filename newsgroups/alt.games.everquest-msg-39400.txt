Minor illusion resets you to indifferent faction with everything, period.

The tradeoff is that you can't move.  You can buy from merchants, which
raises the amusing image of a merchant selling stuff to a tree stump.  I
don't think you can talk to NPCs, but I may be wrong.

The other illusions just reset your base race faction to that of the
illusion that you've assumed.  Any faction adjustments you've made, plus
your religion, still apply.
