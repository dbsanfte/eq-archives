Don't need to and never try to.  Hopefully you feel better after that tho.  I
don't care how I compare to anyone.  I play the game (when the lack of recent
lockups allow it) as I like and enjoy it, and don't ruin the game for others in
my play styles.  When I asked him that I started off as kind of a <nudge, wink>
type comment.  Are you in that guild and took offense?  All he replied with was
something to the effect of "Bah, lol.  No but I will be after my cleric rezzes
me.  :)"  Then traded a few buffs, as I was on my enchanter at the time.  He
obviously took no offense.

I asked a halfling once what he was doing in Elven Society.  He took it with the
same light hearted joking around.  Which is exactly how I meant it.  Not
everyone is out to get you or put you down.
