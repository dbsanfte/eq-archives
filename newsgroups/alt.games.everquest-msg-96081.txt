Message board: YES YES YES  And, despite the downsides, EZboard is the best
out there because "everyone" (in quotes so hopefully no one will take me
LITERALLY) uses it.

Website: not a priority if your board is set up well

Roster: YES, a guild leader had better have a roster.  Sharing it with
members isn't required but a good idea.  In my guild we have a member roster
forum where every member is a moderator so can edit it to add their
pertinent info there.   BUT, I also have a much more complete roster in
Excel that only the officers have access to.

Email addresses: not at all required, except the guild leader...he/she has
GOT to know how to contact people who don't play all the time and don't
visit the message board as often as they NEED to (a few times a week minimum
for a strong guild).

Bank: not required.  After 9 months we finally created a few guild mules but
they aren't seeing a lot of use.  Based on our last guild, anything donated
designed for someone under level 30 is immediately sold to a vendor or
EC...we don't need true newbie crap cluttering the limited space.

Activity planner:  required if the purpose of your guild is to raid
regularly...you need a strong personality to set stuff up.  For fun stuff
it's not REQUIRED but still a good idea.

"Policies" (Guild Charter): Absolutely needed.

Calendar: not needed if you use EZBoard.  A raid board is enough if you
"Sticky" planned activities.
