Your other points are well-noted, but just to play Devil's Advocate a bit,
I'll object to the 'too powerful' part.  How do you know how powerful a
newbie dragon is?  Maybe all the dragons you've seen in game are high level!
Maybe a level 1 dragon really IS as weak as other race newbies, so they hide
in their newbie gardens until they're strong enough to face down those pesky
player characters...

I remember in an old D&D campaign, I modified a bunch of the rules for
dragons.  Two things in particular are relevant here:  First, players
could choose to "attack to subdue", which did non-lethal damage.  If
they did enough subdual damage, the dragon would surrender.  Second,
instead of limiting dragons to using their breath weapons three times
per day, I let them use it as often as made sense, but the damage (or
maybe only part of it, I forget) counted toward the subdual total.  One
effect of these two rules was that a "baby" dragon's breath weapon,
though fairly weak, was potent enough that there was a chance the baby
would subdue itself.  Sort of as if it let loose a blast of flame and
then went wide-eyed and cowered back going, "Did *I* do that??"
