So, nerf monks because warriors AC over 1250 is ineffective?   K, that makes
sense

I think i put an extra 0 in there by mistake.  The difference between
similar geared monks and warriors in my guild is about 300ac

Anyway, extremely high end luclin is where it gets hazy, if theres a problem
its there, and I doubt its even 1% of the game at that level

Lets look at velious quest armour

Monk gloves +10 AC
Arm Wraps  +7 AC
Chest Wraps  +16 AC
Headband  +6 AC
Pants  +6 AC
Slippers  +7 AC
Wrist Wraps  +6 AC

Warrior Boots  +32 AC
Bracer  +25 AC
Breastplate  +59 AC
Crown  +30 AC
Gauntlets  +30 AC
Greaves  +45 AC
Vambraces  +33 AC

Monks gained AC : 58
Warriors gained AC:  254

That is an INSANE difference.  That, after getting fucked over with planed
armour, compare our non-planes crescent armour to cobalt

THAT is the reason monks got dibs on things such as ancient wyvern-hide BP's
(40 ac) over other classes
