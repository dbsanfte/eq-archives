Most of your points are fair as alternative points of view. However, I 
will make this point. While we're sitting here comparing EQ to CoH, we 
have to remember that EQ is 5 years old. It has been around for 5 yeas 
and 7 (almost 8) expansions. It still has a large (if not the largest) 
player base of all MMORPGs. The question is, will CoH gain and /keep/ 
much of a following in the next 12, 24, 48 months? In my opinion, it is 
doubtful. There just isn't anything worth staying for. In your typical 
MMORPG, you usually have a *reason* to hang around whether it is loot or 
crafting or whatever. In CoH, what "new content" can they add? New mobs. 
That's it. Their no loot system, no crafting system, has bound them into 
a position where they are severly limited in what "new" stuff they can 
offer. Any new quests will simply be new wording for the same thing (go 
kill this). They really can't add anything different.

I did enjoy the combat, that's for sure. They *totally* got the combat 
aspect of that game right. In my mind, the "perfect" MMORPG would be a 
mix of a few that we've already seen. Take CoH's combat, Asheron's 
Call's loot system and healing/potions, EQ's depth/content and the 
visuals of SWG, you'd have one heck of a fun system.
