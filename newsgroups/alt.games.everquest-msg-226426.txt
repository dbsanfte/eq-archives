One thing that I've noticed is, you'll often get a hasted Boss mob.
Either if you're an enchanter/shaman or if there's one close by in the
room. Having one or two casters doing Annul on incoming makes those
bosses a lot easier, otherwise it's too easy for a tank to get eaten
before slow even lands. 

There also seems to be a huge difference in diffulty with assassinates
depending on the theme. I tend to think Ruj is among the easiest
because the dungeons branch more. You never have to clear the entire
dungeon to get to the boss. 

Mir is the hardest for me, Most of the dungeons are long/linear and
you might well have to clear all of it just to get to the boss. I
actually lost one of those about a week ago and it wasn't the groups
fault. We had one evac that might have cost us 5 minutes but even w/o
that we wouldn't have made it. It was a linear dungeon with the boss
at the very end. Corridors to narrow to pacify much so you had to kill
em all to get there and there was just no way. Bummed me out at the
time since it was the first adventure I'd lost since the first week
LDoN went live (then lost a buggy collect yesterday <sigh>). 

Overall though, given a good group with pacify or a FD puller, I still
like assassinates. They tend to be more exciting (albeit harder) and I
like having a goal other than just slaughtering stuff. I'd say that
with a non-uber group, it tends to take us about 40 minutes to spawn
the boss so we'll usually finish in about an hour. . Occasionally
we'll get one that's just a lot harder and comes down to the last
minute but those are the ones that you end up remembering, not some BS
slaughter mission that you finished in 45 minutes.
