Aye, these were the only numbers I could find on short notice that covered 
the entire population.  There wre numbers listd for new women-only  cases 
that did include an 'Other (mostly blood transfusions)' category, which 
amounted to... 1%.  I think the numbers have been rounded so they'd make a 
spiffy pie chart. :)

I should also just mention that there wasn't a date on the data.  It 
could -easily- be one or two years old.  The CDC is usually pretty good at 
keeping this stuff up to date, though.
