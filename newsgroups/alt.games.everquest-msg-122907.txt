You can call anyone an idiot that you like.  It's just humorously ironic
when you're trying to blame showeq for people showing up *before* Ragefire
pops.  Simple logic *should* tell any non-idiot that that's just not a
likely culprit.  I'm no expert on packet sniffing, but I grasp the *simple*
concept that there has to first *be* a packet before you can sniff it.

Those two statements cannot coexist in the same sentence.  Either he *does*
have a set spawn time, or he doesn't.  He can't "not have a set respawn
time" that is "x hrs. plus/minus 12 hrs."  That, in fact, *is* a set spawn
time.  And if you don't think people have the ability to figure out "x" then
you haven't spent much time hunting Lodizal.  In EQ, there is no such thing
as "random".

Timing the spawn, theoretically, *always* gives *exact* information on when
a mob will pop.  In *fact* the *only* variation in spawn times is for the
very *first* spawn after a server reset, and every mob in the game that I'm
aware of continues on a *set* respawn timer after that first pop.

Sure sounds like Ragefire follows in kind.  Or perhaps you'd like to stick
to the theory that for some reason Verant sends the spawn time info for
Ragefire to everyones' EQ clients, in all zones, a few minutes before he
spawns.  That's how it'd have to be for you to blame showeq rather than just
accepting that *every* mob in EQ has a respawn time and that *somebody* has
probably figured it out by now for any particular mob, even if you haven't.

Blame showeq for that guy that got to the ancient cyclops before you. 
You've got a chance of being right and nobody will be laughing at you.
