That's true, however, geographical coordinates have the opposite convention:
north/south first.

This and other responses are excellent advice.  I hotkeyed "/loc" to 4 when I
started playing.   I also reset my movement keys to w for straight, q for left,
and e for right.  When I run, I now automatically hit the 4 key with my index
finger from time to time.  You will learn to adjust your path almost
automatically to the shortest route.  It also gives you a loc if you get
attacked and die, or at least an approximate loc (since you can scroll up to
find what direction you were going).
