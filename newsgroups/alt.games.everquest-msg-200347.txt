And if you weren't a blind-assed bottom-reader, you would've seen my message
FIRST since it's at the TOP of the post.  Why get insulting over something
as insignificant as where in a post I choose to write my message?  As it

following the thread they don't have to scroll down through everything
they've already read.  Sheesh!
