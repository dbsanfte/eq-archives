To answer everyone's question, it's just easier to destroy your
Paineel key, especially when hunting in the Hole when you may need to
visit the bank or a merchant once in a while.  If you forget your key
in the bank, which you *will* do, you will not be able to get in to
Paineel without going to PoK first to get the key.  Remember that the
key is handed out free by the guards.
