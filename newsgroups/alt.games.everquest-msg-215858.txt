    There's one level 65 cleric in my guild who just cannot travel anywhere
without being killed by something along the way. Back when we did Vex Thal
he actually got the only CLR/PAL invisibility mask that we ever got, just so
he could invis himself and possibly survive a run to VT, or Ssra, or to the
bank in Tranquility. It seems to have helped - he now dies much closer to
the target zone than he did before!
