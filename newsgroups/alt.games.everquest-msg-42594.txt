Hi,

I just got an email from the Station, saying that apparently one of their
billing periods was skipped.  The text follows:

---

Dear EverQuest Subscriber,

During the course of our latest internal audits of subscriber accounts,
it came to our attention that a malfunction occurred in our billing
process. This malfunction caused your account not to be billed for one of
your past subscription periods. To correct the error, Sony Online
Entertainment will bill the missed subscription amount to your account
prior to your normal billing anniversary date. Your account will be
billed within the next few weeks, bringing it up to date.

We would like to assure you that this error in our billing system has
been corrected, and hope this prior notice of an account action will
allow you to ensure you have proper funds available in your account to
prevent any overdraft charges.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

Did anyone else receive such a letter?  I had not noticed any differences
in my Aunt's checking account balance.  (I pay using her visa debit card)

The email came from "The Station@sony.com" <accounts@station.sony.com>

It was titled "Important Message Regarding Your EverQuest Account"

Did anyone else here get one?  I had not noticed any missed billing.

Just Wondering.

Many Thanks,

 - Mike Dorr
