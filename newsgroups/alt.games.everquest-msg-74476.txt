> Hang onto it.  You have to buy spells in a couple levels.

  Spells for rangers are pretty cheap, since usually you learn the
same spells as a druid, but later.  Druid spells don't really start
getting expensive until 14+.  I doubt all of his level 9 spells
together will cost much more than a single platinum, if that.

  Still, holding on to the money isn't an entirely poor idea.  If you
can find a minotaur battle axe or (preferably) a dwarven axe for 10pp
or less, that might be a good investment.  For armor, I'd just wear
the cloth stuff dropped by orcs for now, or if you want something
better, invest in a sewing kit and  make yourself some patchwork.  You
can improve your tailoring ability by combining two spider silks to
create a silk thread, then make patchwork armor by combining ruined
wolf pelts with a pattern.  Patchwork isn't that difficult to make.
