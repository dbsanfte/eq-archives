Ahh, I kinda gathered from your other post that mana was no object, this
kinda proves it.  A cleric with 255 wisdom WITHOUT his epic (guessing with a
60 enc always on your heals every 2.5 hours).  Very nice.  Rare, except in
uberguild/raid guilds.

Most of the clerics who I still see carrying around the epic is doing it
either for the stats, or because they aren't fooling themselves into
thinking that even with the summoned weapon clerics still can only fight
their way out of a paper bag, compared to ANY melee class. :p

But yes, pretend-melee IS fun.  You're MUCH more uber than my piddly
enchanter with his 11/16 (after SoS) weapon.  And your 1hb skill and
Offensive (IIRC) is like 40-50 more than mine. LOL
