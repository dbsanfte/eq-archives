   Anyone else think its funny that he's defending against the
allegation that he's only been in this newsgroup for a couple of weeks,
not that he's a bozo and an arrogant little fuckwit, or being a complete
waste of air and bandwidth?

   I will admit it, I've been feeling a bit cranky these last couple of
days. I would have been willing to admit that I might have reacted a bit
harshly to a bit of missed humor that didn't come across or something. 
I'm feeling better about it now, though.

Thanks Sean.
