Have you had the problem since?  If not the following may apply...

I once had an issue where I was going LD 3 or 4 times in a 4 hour
period, drove me crazy.  I removed the eqmain, all eqoptions, and
something else now that escapes me.  After that it worked fine.  A
friend of mine thinks I may have corrpted the files and that's what
was causing the LD's.  Dunno, but hasn't happened since then.

And btw, my computer is an AMD 400MHz, so don't believe anyone who
says it's too slow.  As you've found, it will work fine with all
models turned off.  Of course, I've never even tried to go to the
bazaar.....
