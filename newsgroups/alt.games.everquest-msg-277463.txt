Yippee!  This is a good thing, especially since I'm on a server that has a player-policed
rotation system.

Um, wait, I'm not in a Time guild.  Can we have an instanced Fippy encounter instead?

Alas, TP - I never knew ye.

I bet that, in addition to voting for either current server name, we'll have the
opportunity to vote for a third, brand-new server name.

I vote for Boomba the Big.

If they do 1/2 as good a job on other old-world zones as they did with Lavastorm, I'll be
super-de-dooper impressed.  I might get excited over a re-do of Oasis of Marr - the varied
landscape would look great with modern textures.

For icing on the cake, toss a nasty 75+ MOB into the Spectre tower and have at thee!

Aha!  And hope this statement proves true.  It carries some weight, considering the
source.
