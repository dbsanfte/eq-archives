I was hunting the Skulking Brutes in the tunnels which lead up to Dalnirs
Crypt  in Warsliks Woods. The skulking brutes dont really drop much, 1 or
2pp, and occasionally words or a small gem. Another drop is a highquality
brute hide. I dismissed them as worthless, besides I was near encumbered and
they are 5 each. Well, I took one with me, just to see what I got from a
merchant, came out to be some gold, maybe a plat, but not much. Then I did a
price check. The first response was "merchant material", but then another
siad that they go for up to 35pp to tailors! Is this true, can I get 35pp
for one of these, and what item are they used in to make? Thank you very
much in advance.
