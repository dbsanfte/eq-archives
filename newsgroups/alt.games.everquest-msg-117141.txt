I can't actually think of ANY piercers that are a light source, but
a split-paw hide mask works, and at 30, you can easily sneak
down to the assassin room in Guk to loot a no-drop dark elf
mask.

DE form may not be appreciated everywhere, but when out hunting
it DOES give you Ultravision until you can get level 45 and maybe
pick up a Mrylokar helm for right-click UV.
