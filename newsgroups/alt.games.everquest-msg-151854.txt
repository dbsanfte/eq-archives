Mt. Death Mineral Salts and Green Goblin Skins are reported to be worth +3
faction per turnin. You turn in one skin or two salts. Salts are also used for
something else (armor?) so you might have some trouble finding them on
merchants.

Skins also drop (rarely) in the goblin tunnels in LOIO. You're better off
farming Droga just because there are more mobs there.
