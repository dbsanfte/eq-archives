}Having the same issue, was just about to post about it, but geuss Annie beat

}I do know of one workaround, and thats to make a shortcut to EQgame.exe and
}add the word patchme without qoutes under the Target field in the shortcut
}properties.  Not sure how sony would stand on bypassing it though ;-)

I wouldn't worry too much about how they stand on it.  They'd probably 
have to ban 1/4 or more of the playerbase for using it if they had a 
problem with it, so... they aren't very likely to. :)

If you're using patchme to not run the patcher when there's no update 
available, I'd feel sure there's no problem.  If you're using it to do 
something trickier, like avoid updating an altered file, you may be on 
shakier ground.  But still not generally very shaky. :)

I've always thought it was hilarious though, that you have to ask the 
program to 'patchme' in order to -not- be patched. :)
