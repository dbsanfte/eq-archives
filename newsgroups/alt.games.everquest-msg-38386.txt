Hmm...Like I said...dyslectic..apparently getting worse (sig/signs) I
was close. Thanks for the reminder.

I go back a ways, Like in pre usenet,  Bulletin Board days.  There
were two schools of thought then, some liked the top, some liked
under,and some would chop up the original and provide their input

I guess the beat goes on, since I see all three from time to time

Me I am a go with the flow type. For whatever that is worth.
