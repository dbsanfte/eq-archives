The difference being that in a D&D game, its expected that the DM tailer 
the adventure to the party, it would be downright obtuse to tailer 
encounters specifically to ensure that the party couldn't take them. 
Plus if you had to have an encounter that required a Bard in D&D and 
nobody was running a Bard, you either provide them with one somehow, or 
let them dodge the encounter somehow.

In EQ however, there are many encounters, and many parties. And no one 
to tailer them on the fly. So if some of the encounters need groups with 
specific abilities... groups that can take them can take them, and 
groups that can't go around.
