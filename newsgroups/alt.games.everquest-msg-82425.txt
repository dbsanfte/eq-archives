Not at all, Dark and I never inferred from your posting that you're
racist or subscribe to racist beliefs.  

As an American, you can go anywhere in the US and speak English.   You
can go to a number of foreign countries and people will speak English
with you.  There's a uniquely american mind set that everyone speaks
English.   That's not racist, it's just how you've always lived and
the idea that you could be in a polyglot area is kind of a challenge.

Most people in the ng do post in english; there are many more who
don't post because they're not comfortable writing in English.
Americans are, unfortunately, rather rude to non-native English
speakers.

Everquest isn't a uniquely American phenomenon anymore, and I think
we're better for it.  You may have observed there are servers that
seem to have a large population of french, german, chinese, japanese
and korean players.  Basically, any country that allows free access to
the internet with a sufficiently developed economy will have a large
body of players.

You may not encounter them in game because they often join guilds that
cater to their language preference or nationality.  They usually play
in guildchat instead of in the open.  

The newsgroup is called alt.games.everquest; that doesn't mean it's
english only or english preferred.  It's Everquest preferred and that
really should be the only standard.

If you see someone post in a foreign language, just copy the post over
to babelfish or some other translation site (they're mostly
half-witted, sorry to say).  Compose your response in the english
window and translate it over to whatever language is needed, and then
post that in a follow up.

It's a pretty gracious way of making sure everyone's welcome.
