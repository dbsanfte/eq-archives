Says who?

Seriously, you don't KNOW that. You beleive it, which is fine. But 
"Baptists" beleive you will. There's no way to justify one set of 
beleifs is more "right". For all we know we all got it wrong and "God" 
just has a big hate-on for processed cheese....

For what its worth, I figure the OP will burn in hell if it exists. Not 
because its a game, but because he doesn't think for himself, and lets 
"fear of God" determine his actions. I don't think any "God" worthy of 
the name would have a lot of interest in hanging around with fearful 
sycophant idiots.
