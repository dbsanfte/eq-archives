Today, 8 people over 20.  26 mage.  1 20 mage.  3 20 SK.  21 Enchanter, 
20 Shaman

Tell me your story again about how its going to be all mages and wizards?

Or the one about how melee classes are out of the running?  Nearly half 
the field were melee, and not high damage melee either... unless you 
count HT, which I suppose you might, if they can keep PvP to one per 
hour.  The chanter though... can a chanter charm yet by 21?  How did he 
make it to 21 in the first place?  Definately not a traditional burst 
damage class.  Shaman either, they don't have pet till 34, and while 
they can DOT nicely, aren't traditional high damage DOTers.

Honestly, I don't know a lot about PvP, and I can't seem to get a 
character to level 6 without dying anyway, so I can't really experiment 
much.  So I don't know one way or the other.

Splendid One, 58 Gnomage, Firiona Vie
