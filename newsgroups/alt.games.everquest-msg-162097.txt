Rangers were alarmed to hear that Hartsman was not a big fan of archery in
its present incarnation:

Last note, Scott made many indications he isn't happy with archery as it is
currently. He has major beef with endless quiver (a warrior from FoH asked
if warriors would ever get an endless quiver AA or something similar and he
said nooooo waaaay). He said archery was not meant to be the primary ability
of a ranger. He also said that while it is "broken" it isn't outrageously
so. By broken I don't think he just meant the whacky amounts of damage
rangers can do now. I believe he was also talking about the line-of-sight
issues. What it all boils down to though, is I doubt archery will remain as
it is now down the road (probably for both good and bad, heh).

Given recent nerfs to other classes, rangers are a bit jumpy. Yes, archery
may be a little too good right now, but the skill is situational enough that
it doesn't destroy the game. While there's certainly no need for a ranged
autoattack function like many rangers want, neither is there a compelling
need to cripple archery as a whole. Hopefully our little woodland friends
manage to avoid the nerfbat and steer clear of this stormy weather.
