Um.... If I remember correctly... (and im sure if I dont some kind
jackass will put me in my place 8 )  )

the Pres or some such of SOE, had a son that was missing in the
Towers.  Not sure if the individual ever was found alive/dead.. but I
think there was a message of the day when all this happend a year ago.


and IM GLAD, I didnt see another memorial....  did you not get
enough..

if not, record some of the over played videos... and PLAY EM OVER AND
OVER... till you cry and feel better.
