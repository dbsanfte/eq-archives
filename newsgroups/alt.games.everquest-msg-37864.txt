That is one of the reasons why I specified<I think> someone low on life.

I have found, at least at lower levels, it isn't a good idea to leave
someone alive and yelling for help.

Given the choice between a couple of DD spells that will drop someone
quickly vs take a chance of them yelling and a 3rd party thinking "Two guys
out of mana from fighting each other over here. Maybe I can kill them both"
just doesn't appeal to me.

People screaming has a tendancy to draw a crowd. I think it is much better
to have someone at their spawn point ASAP.
