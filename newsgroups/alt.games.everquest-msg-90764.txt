Hey, if it's *not* just a message, think of the boon to newbies! After
you kill a few dozen, you become non-KOS to orcs and from there on out
you can stroll around without them jumping you while you sit to
med/heal. Plus, single pulling will be a breeze.

Maybe it's "working as intended". Now the orcs are a fixable faction and
they'll be giving out quests.
