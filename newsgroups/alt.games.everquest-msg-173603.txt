While it is quite inconsiderate to train the GY without at least announcing
it, it is also pretty stupid to rez and loot in the graveyard if there is a
better option, such as PoN.  Drag the corpse up the hill away from the GY,
then rez and loot.  In the case of PoI, well, you just have to take your
chances.  I recommend doing the rez right at the zoneout, so you can just
click to zone, hopefully before dying.
