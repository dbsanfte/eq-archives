Wrong. He does not have a chance because it is camped. That is the reason. Not
because it is camped by a level 60th character. A twinked level 30th character
that has it camped will still cause your non-twinked level 30th character not to
have a chance. But since the value of the item is now 10kpp and not 400pp, it is
more likely that that level 30th twink will be there with his guild friends 24/7
then that 1 level 60th character.

The item is Lore, remember. So once the 60th has it he is gone. With the other
situations, onces a level 30th twink has it, it is given to a guild member on
the spot and the level 30th twink continues to camp the item. Your chances of
camping it will be much less. Sure you can call to play the PnP rules on the
30th level twink, but you can call those same rules on the 60th level player. So
why dont you?
