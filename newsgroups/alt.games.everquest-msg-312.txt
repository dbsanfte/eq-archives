The latency problem with satellite systems is from the delay caused by your
packets having to make a nearly 50,000 mile round-trip to geosyncronous
orbit and back which, even with your data travelling at the speed of light,
adds about 250 ms to your pings on top of the regular delays.  In a two-way
satellite system, your packets will have to make that trip both coming and
going, giving you an absolute minimum ping to your own ISP of 500 ms.
Reallistically, you'd be doing good to ping 700 ms to the EQ servers.
