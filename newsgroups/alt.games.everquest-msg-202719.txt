First, let me get on the band-wagon and say that I would have prefered 
SoE *NOT* 'fix" KEI, but what is done is done.

Now, for the REAL reason beind this post...can you be certain that they 
"let" the "problem" persist, or did they have bigger, more important fish 
to fry, and decided to let this one go for a while while they 
concentrated on the Big Picture?

From what I understand (and I may be driving on a dirt road that has 
since been paved), there are some (several?) quests, etc that have been 
broken almost since time began in Norrath.  THAT is somethig that I would 
point to as Sony's fault for not fixing.  But KEI?  Is it possible that 
the actual fly in the ointment for these types of spell was a little 
harder to find and fix, without severly breaking something else?  (I said 
severely, as all patches seem to break SOMETHING!)

All I am saying, is put the damnthing behind you.  Don't like the changes 
to fix KEI?  Quit playing or change class you play.  Glad that it 
happened?  Fine...you win.  Now EVERYONE shut up about it.  I have yet to 
see anyone that seems to actually read the argument one either side and 
respond to his/her post.  Both the pro-KEI and the anti-KEI people seem 
to me to have their position, and damned if anything can penetrate their 
opinion.

I've gron sick of KEI, not because of what it does or doesn't do to/for 
the game, but because of the fucking whining on BOTH sides of the issue.  
Did I like using KEI on a too-low level wizard?  Yeah, but I can play 
without it...just ain't gonna level as fast.

And, finally, to address the addicts...When I lost KEI, I dealt with it.  
I *WILL* be glad that people I group with now won't have to leave at the 
worst times to get KEI (although I'm sure they will have to leave for 
something else, equally unimportant).

Conclusion?  Let's move along, shall we?  The KEI thing is fucking over.  
Drop the 200-post threads debating it's merits and need for lower levels 
to have it.
