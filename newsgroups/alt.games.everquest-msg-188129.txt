I'm thinking of rollling up a tank so I'm also thinking of getting him into
Smithing.

He will be an Ogre. Once he gets to the high levels will he be able to make
any really, really nice armor that an elf cleric could wear or is most of
the good stuff cultural?

I saw ranger friend wearing a BP named something like Field Armor BP that
looked really nice - good AC and WIS. It would be nice if my Ogre could make
one of those for my elf.
