Correct relationships.
Yes, there is an 8 hour difference between West Coast USA & London/UK if
they are both in daylight saving. But the rest of the world may not know
that both are in daylight saving time.

So, since I've started playing, all patches have started an hour earlier
that the publicised GMT time.

Not taking the time to make sure that you are giving a correct world
time is a clear indication that SOE has a bad attitude to their
customers.

It is just one of a number of things that clearly shows SOE has a "FY"
attitude to customers. Obviously they need competition.
