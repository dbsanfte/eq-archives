    Strongly agreed. As I said, "coolest concepts".

    Ragebringer's storyline actually has two forks in it, too, which weren't
discovered until well after the epic was solved. But again, look at
implementation: Ragebringer is almost a requirement for rogues, and it's so
overpowered for an epic that there's few items in the game that can replace
it (compare with other melee class epics). The forks in the quest would
never be pursued by any sane rogue before doing their RB, but afterwards can
be farmed nicely (much to Kendrick's horror). It looks good on paper, but is
flawed in practice.

    And hearing Kendrick's zipper story really soured me on him. Ouch,
indeed.
