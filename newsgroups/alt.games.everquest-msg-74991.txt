Well,
	I was playing Fulcon my 18 Druid Wood Elf....  and was hunting
in the Shadeweavers Thicket and decided on a change of view... so
headed over to hollowshade moore.    
	I met several Beastlords and a nice rogue all Cats mind you..
oh and Goldust a young enchanter...  I am the oldest in the group and
we are pulling right out front of the little fort... needless to say
most of the pulls were green and no exp.
	I had goofed around by the entrance to Pauld Caverns and had
fun with the grimlings... so I suggested it to the group...  It
appears that they were nervious about the area because they had tried
it before.  
	Well,  I was the puller.. So I did a little run to pull a
Grimling Herder to give them the taste of killing something that was
yellow to me... and red to them...  
	We dropped this guy rather quickly, and there were cheers
among the group.   So I suggest we take a look, because it was a long
way to pull...  They were rather motivated now and agreed.
	After follwing the zone wall to the body of water... we set up
our camp near the penesula near the zone wall (also near the PC zone).
	We sat there killing the herders and the cows (they do weak
poison) with a few close calls, and only one death in the group.
Everyone seemed to be havng a blast.  Id like to attribute that to the
fact of hunting in a new area and learning the ways the beasts work.
	
	In another thread someone mentioned their first time to
Crushbone and the chills they got fighting for their lives and how
much fun it was....   Well this night brought it back for me... Great
crew of players, in new and unfamiliar territories.... WHOOT!!!  what
fun.



This ol'boy is just loving Luclin... especialy in the younger
characters.
