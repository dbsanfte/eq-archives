Well with a healthy buffer I'm on 100% AA now and looking for
places to spend it.

Sadly, as a cleric, there's not a whole heck of a lot that looks
really fun or important.

I decided on this little gem, and I've been having a great deal
of fun with it so far.

Here's how it works.  You get a hotkey for it which you plunk
into a hotkey bar.  Click this button and you get the effect, and
the button stays "down" for three minutes until its ready to go
again.

The effect takes about a second (you get the countdown bar like
casting spells or clicking items that arent insta click) to go
off, then boom, goes off.

What happens, as I understand it, is that everyone ends up with
the same amount of damage.  Heavily damaged people get a "heal"
and lightly damaged people get "nuked" till all are even.  Thats
just how it looks in the group box, too, BOOM everyone gets
smacked... except for the ones that were already hurting, they
are healed up fast and hard.

At level one, 20% is added to the overall damage before its
redistributed.  At level two, only 10%, and at level 3, no damage
is added, I think.

So, why is this a good idea?  Well, firstly, its fast... faster
than SR even, and no worry about refresh time on your spell icons
if you just cast something.

Second, its mana free, makes a good last ditch heal if thats what
you need, or a good post res fix if you are looking at downtime
anyway.

Third, and most interesting, it maximizes the effect of group
heals.  Group heals are among the most efficient HP per mana
spells in the game... except that you normally don't get all 6
people healed, because some of your group is undamaged.  With
Arbitration, though, everyone is hurt, in fact everyone is hurt
the same amount!

Why is that interesting?  Well for one thing, I'm frequently
using group heals because several group members are hurt and its
going to take a lot of time to heal one after the next, and a lot
of wasted mana since they won't necessarily use the full value of
those heals.  Arb makes my group heals more effective.

For another, I have Thurg quest legs, which give me a no mana 105
point group heal... 630 HP per 12 seconds, or aroudn 3000 hp a
minute free, with a horse, absolutely free as I'm medding while I
click.  Same effect on Skyshrine quest, Kael quest, and POG drop
cleric legs, so this should be handy over quite a range of levels
and equipment loadouts.

For a third, other classes have group heals.  Paladins have very
effective group heals, Wave of Prexus heals 660 points per
person, and I"ve seen pallies cast this a lot.  The necromancer I
was grouped with had a lifetap that nukes the mob for 1000 points
and gives each person in the part 800.  Arbitration makes these
spells far more effective than when only two or three people in
the group are hurt (and those two are so heavily injured that 800
points means little)

I didn't get to play with this angle, but Regeneration spells
should also multiply in effectiveness with this AA; instead of
just the MA getting the effect most of the day, now everyone is
regenning the damage the MA took; multiply the regen effect by 6.

Currently I only have Arb at level one, which means the
multiplied effectiveness of GHeals and regen is offset by the
added 20% damage.  Based on how well its working now, I plan to
go to two and then to three before looking around for my next bit
of fun... although half the effect of DA comes from its "Ack!"
effect; very short activation time to do a massive heal to anyone
(or two) who are getting beat to death faster than I can hope to
emergency heal them.
