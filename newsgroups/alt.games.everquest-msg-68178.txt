Actually, the memory on the link he gave was PC2100 memory, which is
why it is $55.  The stuff that was $38 a month ago was PC133 memory,
which is still $38 from Crucial ($34 if ordered via the web).

However, there is another problem...most motherboards that take PC2100
RAM seem to only have two slots, so if you want to get past 512 MB,
you need to use sticks with more than 256 MB.  From Crucial, a 512 MB
stick is quite a bit more than twice the cost of a 256 MB stick.
