Could. Windblades are no longer the 'welcome to POP' prize they were,
unfortunately.

Out of interest though, assuming that those figures were correct,
why would a ranger do more damage than a knight, both equipped with a 
windblade? Are there different skill caps?

If the answer is they would do similar damage, why does the paladin
fare badly from a deal that lets him do the same, or similar, damage
to a class that gave up defensive ability to deal more damage, while
keeping his defensive and healing skills?
