I think it's foolish to believe the two can be separated.  IMO
it's fairly obvious that providing these new summoned items
(have to see a mage every play session or go without) is, in
fact, going to be a large part of the "solution" for mages.

The developers tend to ignore the player "service economy."
Ports, for instance, should get wizards and druids into groups.
Well, that doesn't happen when it's fairly easy to get a port
without getting the porter.   I've no idea how many mages
will sell the items (or just provide them for free) but I do
believe that, if it becomes common, the intent of the
developers to provide a motive for groups to include mages
(something lacking in high-end groups, to say the least) is
going to be subverted.

And, yes, I believe a market will develop very quickly.  Maybe
not for the average XP group, but I'm pretty sure that the solo
classes are going to be very desirable of items that can
increase their damage potential AND reduce their mana usage.
From what (little) I've seen of the item descriptions, they'll both
increase DD spell  and DoT damage as well as increase the
longevity of spells cast like snare and/or root.  Add in the ability
to reduce mana outlay by 10% per quad (or single kill) and you
get a very nice bonus for druids, wizards, and necros who solo.
And I'm pretty sure they'll be more than happy to pay for that
increased leveling efficiency.

(Pure aside:  If people want to talk about "dumbing" down the
game or making the game easier, these items are the perfect
example.  A 10% increase in DD damage is going to be a huge
bonus for someone just learning to quad, for instance.  And,
at least in the case of the solo classes, that's going to apply
directly to the length of time needed to level.)
