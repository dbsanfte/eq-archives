Hate to tell you this, but as a cleric, your melee damage will always
suck, and it'll only get worse the higher level you get.

As for a cheap weapon that will help the damage output, I think one
that would work might be called a disease encrusted hammer, (blanking
on the name) if I remember the stats it's 10/21 with a 2 disease
damage, which works well against most mobs, making it 12/21.  Don't
forget you have a bash skill now, which is helpful and can't be used
when you're using a two hander.

For two handers, I don't know how much a rod of lamentation is going
for these days, but it might be around 2k, and it's a nice weapon.
