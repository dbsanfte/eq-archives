I'm still working the nightly skeleton spawn but tonight was strange.

I've had it cast spells on be me before where I lose control and just
go running off. But this time I was under some sort of control spell,
but I still seemed to function normally, only I wasn't doing anything.

I thought I was dead for sure, I was down about %50 and running right
into the main area of undead .. but then I stopped ... cast a heal,
then cast some offensive spells on the commander and killed it. 10
seconds later whatever spell it was wore off and I was ok.

What sort of spell was it that I functioned probably better than I
would have had I actually been in control ? lol

The whole time I was staring at a hillside so couldn't see anything.
Neither could I find it's body anywhere. I got the kill and experience
gained message but it's body was nowhere. 

It also seemed like I was lagging cause when I first starting running
off I ran for like 4 seconds, then rubber-banded back to where I
started, it done that 3 times in a row. But the lagometer was reading
normal the whole time.
