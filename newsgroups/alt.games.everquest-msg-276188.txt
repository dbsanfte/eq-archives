EQ1 was a learning process (ie no one really had a clue what was going
on) for the industry as much as it was for the playerbase. Things have
changed since then; the industry believes it understands MMOGs better
now; and one of the 'articles of faith' now is "You will have
expansions, so plan for them." So in theory EQ2's development should
follow a smoother and more coherent plan. In theory.

I think I read somewhere that EQ2's core engine was designed from
scratch to support levels up to 200, so who knows what it will look
like in a few years.

Remember, they want you to keep p(l)aying - they will provide you with
stuff to do :) Population pressure in high level areas (this was before
the concept of instancing) was one of the major drivers for EQ1's first
expansion.

Max level now is actually 70, but the principle is the same. There are
a substantial number of people at level 70, but I would say the
majority of *characters* are below 70. A long time ago (first half of
2002 I think - after Luclin, before PoP, so when the max level was 60),
someone at Sony mentioned in passing 'Over half of all accounts have a
character over 50', and of course almost without exception a given
character levels *up*, but like you most people like creating new
characters, and we all start at level 1.

Well, that's pretty much all the 'content' there is :) Oh, and new mobs
:) EQ2 has an obvious 'in story' way to add new content - oh look,
there's a new island the mariners have found that they were too scared
to visit before there were level 60 players to protect them... Oh look
there's been an earthquake and a new island has risen from beneath the
waves... Oh look the mariners have developed better boats that can
travel further - and they've found a new island... You get the idea.
EQ1 had to invent whole new continents.

> Has EQ1 changed much from it's initial release?

That's far too broad a question for me to even consider answering,
except to say: Yes *and* no.
