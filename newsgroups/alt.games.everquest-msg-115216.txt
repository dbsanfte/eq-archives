Neither yourself nor myself can say whether it was a minor or major
inconvenience.  What I can assess is that it was poor raid etiquette.
Anyone who cant attend a multi-group raid and not sacrifice a little of
their convenience has no business being on a raid.  I am sorry if the raid
leader made an assumption about something that is standard on raids.  The
poster obviously has not been on many raids to realize the wrap up role that
druids and wizards play.  Its part of their job on a raid, like it or not,
argue against it all you want but its a fact of the way raids operate.
