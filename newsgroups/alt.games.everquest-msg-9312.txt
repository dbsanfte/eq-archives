well, First of all, the Shadowknight is a hybrid class, not a melee,
Second, there is only one warrior class

Melee

Rogue/rouge
monk/monkey
Warrior/Dumb Tank

Hybrid
Ranger/manasink
ShadowKnight/Taunt machine
Paladin/I wanna be a cleric

Priest
Druid/Dr00d
Shaman
Cleric

Caster
Enchanter/Manaboy
Wizard/Boomer
Necro/Solomaster
Mage/Petmaster

Bard/I can do everything(badly)

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
