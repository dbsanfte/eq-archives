I'm in the process of growing a cleric now (34 so far) and have to
agree with you this last paragraph.  It seems the key is my pets
(errr... tanks that I group with) work the heck out of their taunts.
I can pretty much do what ever I want as far as casting goes and
*very* rarely do I draw aggro to myself.  And when I seldom do, they
taunt that bugger right the heck off of me.

Then again, I'm also not shy about a quick stun/root/wrath combo
either if the situation calls for it.
