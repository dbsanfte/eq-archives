Congrats!!  That's awesome, boy I can't wait for mine, but it's nice to hear
that it's still being done.  Ronny Cook replied to my reply (hehe), and he
said he had some ideas about doing the hole and getting people there.
Here's a thought:  send a mage down and have the mage call of hero.  From
what I've read, towards the bottom, where you need to do the slaughter,
there is a spot that call of hero would work in (no adds or such).  Oh, to
have a large guild.
