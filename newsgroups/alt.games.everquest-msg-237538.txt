Down here they run ads all the time they will pay you for your plasma.. its
not like you're saying "Well.. ill give you my plasma... but im going to
need ..." they are saying "let us show our apreciation for you taking your
time to come down here and spending your gas to get here just so you can
give us plasma by giving you X amount of dollars"

There are two sides to every arguement guy.  If you feel you need to make
some sort of "moral" contribution, then turn down the offering of 30 dollars
and be proud of yourself. as for the rest of us... show me the money.
