It gets worse. I had my iksar monk grouped with my halfling druid, both
52, in Jagged Pine killing bandits. The druid was set to ding while the
monk was at about 75%. Setting the druid to 100% aa, the druid had 85%
of the first aa and the monk still hadn't dinged. That's when I decided
to keep the monk 52 for guild vox runs. :)
