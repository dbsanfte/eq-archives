    He did dwarves for the first few levels, then moved on to brownies. He
wasn't the only person using the brownies, and that's what really got them
nerfed. They had their spawn time reduced, and the bodyguard/accountant
spawns in High Keep got their spawn times inflated (and were eventually
removed from the game entirely). The race to 60 also got a few ugly safe
spots in Sebilis fixed.
