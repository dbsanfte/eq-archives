Agi does mater.  As a Warrior, I am always told by others who do not paly
warriors that I need more STA gear.  I should get my STA to its max.  I do
believe that STA is important but also I feel that AGI is not to be ignored.
As a warrior, my Sta right now is 167 unbuffed and AGI is 143 unbuffed.
When I get an AGI buff I do notice that my Health bar does not go down as
fast during fights.  Since Rangers are not made to be tanks I do not know
how AGI effects them.

For example, last weekend I was in tanking for a group in KC.  My warrior is
level 52 and can tank KC very well.  A guildmate of mine, a 55 monk, was in
our group and a shaman from our guild.  I had an AGI buff which made my AGI
around 200.  During a fight with a Skeleton Guardian I had been buffed with
a Speed spell and the skeleton was slowed.  The monk and myself were tag
teaming the skeleton.  During the fight, the Cleric of the group was
commenting about how amazed she was because we were simply not getting hit.
Jokingly we responded that if she wanted us to get hit we could sit down for
a second.

At level 50, 20 points of STA gives you 100 points of health.  If my max HPs
unbuffed are already 2800 what diference will an additonal 100 points make?
If increasing my AGI by 20 points helps me get hit 5-7 less times during a
fight with these higher level mobs then I think the AGI is worth more than
the STA.
