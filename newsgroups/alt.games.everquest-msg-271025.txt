Right. I could choose to fall behind and not play with them undermining 
the entire reason I bought the game.

I chose to quit instead.

Not sure how that is relevant. There are innumerable cases where friends 
disagree on things. However, I actually like EQ, when I dont have my 
nose to the grind. And my friends liked the game too... and they didn't 
enjoy grinding but they were following the crowd, and were tempted by 
the lure of easy fast xp... if SOE had rewarded them to quest and hunt 
in dungeons and didn't reward them so well for sitting in easy static 
camps they would have quested and hunted in dungeons and they would have 
been happier for it. And the game would be better for it.
