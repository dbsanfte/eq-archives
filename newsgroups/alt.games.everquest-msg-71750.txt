Hail, all!

Would anyone know how to modify the text colour announcing that a mob starts
casting a spell, please?

At the moment, the text is an very-hard-to-read dark blue and I'd like to
lighten the shade to make it easier to read. I usually keep mashing my
'Bash' key but against caster mobs, I find it hard to time just right.

TIA,

OgreLowbie
