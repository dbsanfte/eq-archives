Theres a lot of backward thinkging people that can't see the forest is 
actually inside a video game, part of a fantasy world, where it 
shouldn't matter whether MacDonald's or the NBA writes your paychecks 
because their influence isn't felt.

Now if this was a 'The Matrix' spin-off, I'd endorse this maybe. It 
would fit with the game. But this is EQ, a D&D inspired fantasy...it 
fits like a the proverbial square peg in the round hole.

No.

Keeping all that in mind.
