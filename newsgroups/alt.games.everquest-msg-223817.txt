I agree. Even with every bone being advertised if not wanted (On 
Bristlebane at least) The sternum was a pain but that was only the 
introduction to the pain of........

The final task

As a Dark Elf SK  the task is your weapon and shield.

They need petrified bones. They drop off only 2 uncommon Skeletons in 
Nektulos Forest. Even with 'Sense Undead' and a rough idea of where to 
find them. It was a pain.

The final score from my log was 82 Decaying Councilmen and 50 Decaying 
Initiates. This does not include those killed by my Pet. Who on average 
killed as many as I did.
So that was over 250 kills to get 5 bones.

 From my log, at first I averaged 18 kills (36 including my Pet), plus 
assorted undead and Halflings while waiting for respawn, in an evening 
play (approx. 2 hours)  This lasted 5 days.

I gave up and went to explorer and hunt elsewhere after I got the sword 
at level 15.

After that I killed an average of 6 every time I visited Neriak. that 
was spread over 1 year of real time.

I went from 12 to 24 before I finally finished it out of sheer habit.

The Sword was only so-so at level 15 when I got it.
the Shield / Cloak was worse than items I had already looted elsewhere 
by the time I got it at level 24.

They now rot in my bank account until I need the space for something 
else.
