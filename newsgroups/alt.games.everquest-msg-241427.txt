At one time, I believe it was true, but now the same restrictions, afaik,
are on FV as on other servers; ie, KEI, Virtue, others you must be level 45+
(or 46+) to have cast on you, but I was getting hit with chloroplast by a
mid-40's shaman at level 15. It's still stated in the rules for FV, I
believe, but was nerfed at some point. It'd be great if the level-limitation
for spells and the alignment limitation for grouping were to be brought
back. :)
