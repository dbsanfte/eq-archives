This subject line brought to you by the Department of Redundancies
Department! ;) Yeah, I know it's a typo, and the second caused

[Snip Jason's train]

Well, once me and some friends were doing Frenzy in LGuk, not too long
ago, in fact. We had a paladin doing his best impersonation of a bard,
pulling more than half a dozen at a time, and an enchanter screaming at
him, working her buns off keeping all of those frog ghouls mezzed. One
time, the mage sent his pet into the train from the wrong angle, and it
pathed the wrong way... So it gallantly fought about a half-dozen adds
out of our sight.

Me being the cleric, I called for us to get out of Dodge, but for some
reason the pally and the mage didn't start running, so me and the
enchanter tried to contain the hordes. Then we found out why they weren't
responding, as the Dynamic Duo went LD (they were playing from the same
location). At this time, we had about a dozen froggies on us, and a long
haul to the zone line. With two weak classes. Oh joy...

So I start hightailing it thru the maze, the enchanter close behind, and
we keep picking up adds... And I get lost, as I always do in dungeons...
I ran around about 75% of Dead Side, and died in the Exe room, surrounded
by froggies. Curse my poor sense of direction... No hard numbers, but
between Frenzy and Exe are a lot of (uncamped at the time) ghouls...

I didn't really witness this, as the group wizzie was on top of things
and evac'd at the right time, however, one CoM raid went kerflooey
way up on those transparent walkways, and resulted in what was, from
what I heard, a sight to behold. Gotta love 3D dungeons for impressive
trains...

[Snip the rest, as I can't remember any impressive tales]
