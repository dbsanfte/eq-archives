Hey usernet, I love to make simple things complex. :(

xfer=transfer

I played EQ a while ago and I'm thinking of going back to maybe raid.
I haven't gone too long, just got most of my t5 SoD stuff and had to
jet due to RL stuff. Highest things I've raided was t1 SoD stuff and
Krond in MMM.

Problem is if I were to stay on my current server I'd have to leave
every few months due to RL schedule conflicts with group/raid
schedule.  I won't be able to raid ever, obviously. What raiding guild
wants someone who is gone most of the year?

To play year-round I'd need a server with a population/raid time
that's best at late night pdt 7pm-1am or so.

Sure, I could run on each server and check the boards ask in gen chat,
but I'll get 'wise' responses or none at all.

So, I was thinking of reactivating my ancient box account and hanging
out on servers I've seen compatible guilds running on, and get a feel
for it (the server).

When I first played on my current server it worked, now it doesn't. I
love the 'chill' atmosphere of the server and the super nice friends I
have... However, so many have retired and ones that remain I rarely
saw about IIRC.

My other concern is should I grind anything on my 'main' account
before xfering or should I just go? It'd be a nice cushion to have
another few hundred AA or so and perhaps finish my mpg trials.

Recap:

1. I'm thinking about xfering, is my server-check idea a good plan?
2. Should I vanity grind before xfering or just xfer? (Hey, ever bit
helps right?)
3. How are server xfers seen by guilds? Anything I can do (that isn't
necessarily obvious) to make an xfer easier and not look as 'ugly'?
