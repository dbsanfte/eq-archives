Nah, the company doesn't appear any worse now than before.  I mean, I do
like Brad and wish him well and think he did a great job, but Verant's
attitude hasn't seemed to openly change (to the public anyway).

Customer service has always sucked.  Verant has always sunk their money into
coders and added customer service as a last minute not-very-important thing.
They've never had enough people to help...never enough people manning phones
and email...never enough GMs.

Real coders don't do dox.  They don't offer support, either.  That's always
been prevalent.

Thank god Verant has made an excellent game that doesn't REQUIRE much
support, but it'd be damned nice to have some when it IS needed.
