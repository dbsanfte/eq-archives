According to the latest info from Verant, only one stat matters for a
tradeskill.  For smithing it is the highest of WIS/INT/STR.  For Baking I
believe it is the highest of WIS/INT.  AFAIK, the higher the stat is the
better.  I know this is different from other things they have said in the
past, this is, to the best of my knowledge, the latest thing said by Verant
regarding tradeskills.
