	I spent a lot of time there recently with my leezard Necro, so he'd be
non-KOS in Paineel and poised to enter Stonebrunt when it launches.  (He
soloed from 13 to 15 there, and to 17 now in Kerra.)

	Near as I can tell, the Warrens is designed to require balanced groups
operating under full raid protocols -- assisting a main tank, mezzing or
rooting adds, dedicated healer, someone on slows (all the dogs have
accelerated attack rates), another on snares, etc.  The dogs are packed too
closely together for anyone who gets EP here to pull singles, they all run far
too fast and have large call-for-help ranges.  (Where a newbie group is
supposed to get the mana for all this, I don't know; they won't even have
Breeze.  Snares will particularly hurt as the only spells local groups will
have for that are NEC darkness line spells, and the mana cost on those is
brutal compared to Snare.  Of course, sitting down to med causes every dog
within hundreds of feet to agro on you, too.)

	Needless to say this is idiotic.  Newbies don't know raid protocols and
they won't learn it here; the zone is too difficult for them.  They'll just go
play somewhere else.  Experienced players running secondaries aren't going to
go someplace where they'll have to do this kind of work; they'll get on their
primaries instead and go raid Kael or Velk's or whatever's open.

	It was not surprising, then, that 80% of the time I was the only one EPing
in the zone.  There were, of course, high-level players trashing the place for
faction.  I have some lovely screenshots of the place with halls full of dead
dogs, as well as a great shot of one of the perpetrators (a high-50s Warrior
in Kael armor).  There's also the L34 Druid who showed up periodically to pull
the Muglwump to the zone line so he could solo it.  And the time a post-50
Paladin buffed me up so I could kill the Foodmaster/Smithy for him, 'coz he
wanted Ye Auld Ball Peen Hammer.  (Seems that buffs don't set off the TCC if
cast before the fight.)  I have no idea why he wanted it; I wouldn't put one
on a twink myself.

	The final, most serious indictment against the Trivial Combat Code: it
simply does not work.  There will always be a reason for high-level characters
to trash lower-level zones.
