Hmm, only just now saw that I'm using two IH 1 items.  In one
more level this will be come utterly useless as I'll move to a
heal over level 20 ( the one I use now is level 19 so IH 1 still
working at 28) and even before that, only one was working.  In
point of fact, the helm was the one that alway fired.  This means
that items are checked by location, or some other scheme, but not
alphabetically (reverse alphabetically?) as I never ever saw the
medicine totem fire off.

Spell Haste I should continue to be useful indefinately, since
certain low level spells remain staples (root most noticably) but
I'd benefit from SH II quite  a lot, I think, as those are slower
spells in general anyway, so harder to channel, and SH II would
still work on all the level I spells.

Other holes: the two Giant Scalemail pieces seem weak, I bet I
can upgrade those slots without spending too much cash.

The vast majority of these items were purchased or selected from
gear I had with HP as the first priority, and thus far I've been
quite happy with that descision.  I rarely go anywhere near the
bottom of my mana pool, so depth of mana pool hasn't been an
issue so far.  Stats, saves, and even AC in general don't seem to
do a whole lot for a character, so I've ignored those as well,
although I think I have a fair amount of AC for my level just as
a side effect of getting good HP gear.

I should probably look into even more focus gear to extend my
mana pool still further, adding affliction efficiency for
example.

I also looked into upgrading my weapon: to get a marginally
better ratio 1hb looks like it would run me several thousand pp,
I'd pay that for a MUCH better weapon, but one thats just a
little better?  Hard to blow 2Kpp to move from 9/22 to 10/22,
particularly when I suspect less and less of my damage output
will come from melee as I level up.

I have an extended range II item I don't seem to ever equip,
forgot to find it and write it down.  A ring if I recall
correctly, and that meant dropping 65 or 75 HP!  If I can wear a
sebelite scale Bracer I should run and get one of those for
myself, although that will be a pain since they are no drop.
