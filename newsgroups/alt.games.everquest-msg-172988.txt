I'm going to play devil's advocate here, as the guy does make some good
points.

The opening credits of a movie take a few minutes. This guy spent a decent
amount of time (20 hours?) on it.

If a came can't captivate you in twenty hours, it *is* flawed. Modern EQ
is designed around high levels and twinkers. To some extent it's designed
around "secret knowledge" - stuff people are just expected to know. We're
all far too used to just knowing this stuff.

I mean, look at the spell lists. There's almost no hints in-game as to what
the different spells do. Some of them are painfully obscure. If you lack
that knowledge base the game is much harder. Admittedly the lists were
*created* by somebody, but some people enjoy that form of exploration and
others do not.

Look, I enjoy Everquest, but the guy has a point.

Actually play starts changing around level 5 in my experience; at around
that point simply attacking until something dies ceases being a viable
strategy for some classes. Class distinctions become genuinely important
in around the teens.

In any case, that leaves the point that the bottom end game has problems,
and that life for the *inexperienced* newbie is difficult. Regardless of
how we may dismiss levels 1 to 10 as a cakewalk.

Pretty much agree with you here, basically... if you're not interacting
with other players, you might as well be playing a single-player RPG.
(not, in itself, a bad thing.)

At the low levels, especially if he doesn't have PoP, there's relatively
little accessible content, and much of what there is is similar from zone
to zone. You can only spend so much time killing bats and beetles before
you wonder why you're bothering. And "experience grinding" is not so
described because it's fun to do.

What level would you say the "interesting parts" begin? How long would
it take a complete newbie to reach them? And how reasonable is it to
expect a new player to wait that long for a payoff? If it's no fun, it's
work. Asking people to pay to work in their leisure time is silly.

Other games deal well with similar situations much more smoothly. The EQ
graphics engine is a resource hog; I can be staring at a *wall* and get lag.
My system is no powerhouse by modern standards, but EQ is not a particularly
modern game and its graphics are nothing terribly special. Its graphics
engine is *very* poorly optimised.

If I can play Morrowind with minimal lag, I should be able to visit
Dawnshroud Peaks and not worry about my frame rate dropping to the seconds-
per-frame range.

20-25 hours per week is three hours a day. When three hours a day is
regarded as "casual" play... waiter, may I have the reality check?

I play about the same amount, by the way.

The bottom line is that he's played the game for a large chunk of time -
enough time to *finish* some shorter RPGs - and has not enjoyed the
experience sufficiently for it to be worthwhile continuing.

I agree that the game is worthwhile in the long run, but let's not pretend
that it is without it's problems.
