(...and before anyone posts a 'TAKE THAT, DROODS!' post, I would like to
remind you Harmony is also an effective grouping tool. I have used it in
both group and solo encounters)

Apparently, Harmony no longer works on mobs higher than 40 (ish -- exact
level yet to be determined). I can understand Harmony not working in the new
Planes, but the 'old worlds' nerf just boggles me.

Some mobs include in the test include

Suits in Wakening Land - Cannot be harmonied
Mature Rockhopper in Mons Letalis - Cannot be harmonied
Wyverns in Cobalt Scar - Cannot be harmonied
Othmir Warriors in Cobalt Scar - Cannot be harmonied
Othmir Chief (as reported) in Cobalt Scar - Cannot be harmonied
Yvolcarn  in Cobalt Scar - Cannot be harmonied
Frost Giant Elites in Great Divide - Cannot be harmonied
Frost Giant Scouts in Great Divide - *Can* be harmonied

I know the server just went down, but I really doubt it was to fix it.
