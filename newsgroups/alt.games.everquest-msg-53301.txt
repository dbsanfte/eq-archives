Last night in Kelethin some bozo was spamming for plat, etc. for half an hour. 
Ignoring people who told him to shut up.  I was bored.   I asked where he
was... at the bank naturally.
So I run up to the bank.  And begged him to death.  He finally left the bank. 
(Trying to escape me I think).  He tried to escape to the orc lift - he was
STILL /shouting for stuff....  I followed him ... begging all the way - not in
shout of course just talking.  People were cracking up.  He finally logged off
:)  
Yall can thank me later...
