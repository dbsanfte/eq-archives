An expenditure tax eventually results in an asset tax though it make take
generations to happen. I do not favor real front end asset taxes since they
tend to be extremely intrusive. I certainly do not favor income taxes since
they discourage working.

The spending tax outlined at fairtax would work well though grandfathering
in iras , roths and suchnot would be cumbersome. It works at a much lower
tax rate precisely because it does recapture some old money assets that get
spent by younger generations. It can also bypass most of the class envy
since it taxes noone up tp the poverty level.
