Beastlord have a rather limited choice of weapon types,

1) Martial - Hand to hand weapons, Ulaks and the like, you can puck up a
good h2h weapon starting from a little as a few PP (Look out for the
stupidly cheap Polished steel ulaks, great item, piles of stats and under
10pp), but the higher end stuff is stupidly over priced.

2) 1 hand piercing -  Stabbing sticks, Daggers and knives, you can get some
really nice 1hp weapons very cheaply, they also tend to be very fast I would
recommend getting a bloodclaw when you get a chance procs at 17, and goes
for around 40pp.

3) 1 Hand blunt - Bashing sticks, clubs staffs and the like, These can be a
mix of High damage and high speed, but procc'ing examples tend to fetch a
much higher price.

4) 2 hand Blunt - Bigger bashing sticks, Very hard hitting weapons, this
skill if often neglected due to a beastlords lack of double attack, but
comes in handy against those higher level mobs with annoying damage shields,
look out for a cheap frost giant femur, good dmg/delay procs Yaulp II at
only level 1 (possible bug ?) and goes for around 30 pp

As to what weapon type to use ?
At the pre 30 levels you will level up rather alot faster than your skills
so pick one type to keep maxed but dally in at least 1 other (I've maxed
H2H, almost maxed 1hp and i'm ok with 2hb) but bear in mind your epic is H2H
so dont let that skill slip.

Once you hit 17 you get Duel weild so it becomes easier to max out skill
(put 2 of the same type in each hand) or practice another without losing too
much damage.

Enjoy your beastlord they as awesome fun !
