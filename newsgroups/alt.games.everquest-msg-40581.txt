hehe. I dont know why but this kind of 'd00d speak' annoys me no end, I admit I
was guilty of it a little when I first used the internet, then thank god i
found usenet and realised it wasnt kewl it was just shit. It's so awful in AOL
chat rooms, I rapidly lose my faith in humanity when 'peeps' abbreviate every
known word with multi coloured nausea inducing jumpy fonts. my personal
favourite is: 'Yeppers'
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
I really believe these people should have enormous amounts of pain inflicted
upon them.
btw somethingawful.com has a hilarious guide to ICQ and AIM messaging that rips
the piss in a way only that site can, I loved it.
