It sounds just like what i went through when i moved and it actually turned
out to be my wiring for my cable. I figured it was my setup as well since i
could always get back on right away but it turned out to be corroded cable
wires they had to replace outside my house for me to maintain a stable
connection. Or it could be a router issue but to me it does sound like it's
your isp or wiring, tellyour isp you keep getting brief disconnects and they
can probably sort it out for you. My cable modem's lights go red when I lose
connect and they never did when i had the wiring issue so I was really
boggled by it till they dug up my yard and replaced the wires and it all
worked fine again.
