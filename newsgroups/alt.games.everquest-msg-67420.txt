He is around 38, but he's a major undercon.  Until the 2H
weapon upgrades, he could seriously kick my Paladin's butt 
at level 53.

I've never seen more than one Cenobite up at one time (darn it), but
there are often Justicars in the room.  But it's easy to pull the
AoF back down the tunnel away from them if you don't pull them
accidentally.  Get the highest level person in your group to
do the pulling, and if the Justicars are green to him, they
won't come.


>3) Harmtouches for about 380

Yup.


>4) Has a lizzie PH

Yup -- either a Justicar or a Champion.


>5) Drops either the claws ( which you will see ) or the BP

Right.

This group might be a bit underpowered, so be careful.

Tips:  The AoF has a huge aggro radius, you can "pull" him by
simply standing way outside his room in the hallway, no need to
run into the room itself and aggro his friends.  So if he's
up, have everyone else stand way back while the highest level
person in your group walks slowly towards the chamber.  Then
he runs back to the group when the Harmtouch hits, signalling
that the AoF has aggroed.

If he has the claws, he hits a lot harder and faster than
if he has the BP.

You can tell if he's already up by getting about halfway to
the room and having the Cleric use Sense Undead.  If he's up,
the Cleric will sense his skeleton pet.  If no Crusaders or
Ritualist are up (they also have skeleton pets, which can
interfere with the check if they happen to be closer to
the Cleric than the AoF), you can even
do an AoF check from the zone-in point the same way.

The AoF chamber has two "layers", the ground level and the
upper "water" level.  You can move between them by swimming
up or down through the big green ball that the AoF lives
in (after the AoF is dead, of course).  To get to the lower
level directly, you have to go through the gator pools, which
is a big fight in itself.  It's much easier to approach the
AoF room from the upper level.  From the courtyard, go into the
door you'd normally use to reach the Throne Room, then take a
left at the "T" instead of a right -- follow that hallway,
which will be sparsely populated by a wandering lizard or
two, and the door at the very end of the loooong twisting
hallway will open into the upper layer of the AoF room.
There will be three random lizards swimming in the shallow
water there, they're easy to pull singly.  If their friends
heal them, just pull farther back into the hallway.

Subsequently pulling the stuff from the "floor" is a bit
tricker, since they'll be in air and you'll be in water
if you're swimming/wading around in the upper level.  And
as you may know, you can't cast across air/water
boundaries.  But there's a little trick you can use --
stand in the very edge of the doorway, and you'll be in
air.  Now you can target something down on the AoF room
floor and cast at it to get it to come running at you.
Sometimes the open door itself will block your view, but
if you stand close enough to the edge of the end of
door frame (i.e., just about to fall off the edge
and into the water), you can let the door close on
you and you'll still be "inside" the room, balancing
on the lip of the doorframe.  From there you can cast
on the floor spawns and pull them.  Or just get a
Levitate if someone in your group can cast it and
cast from above the water itself.

Pulling/fighting from the top level also gives you
more of a chance to survive if you have to run --
it's a lot closer to the courtyard, and the run
back won't be through 3,583 other mobs, like the
lower route back through the gator pools would be.
A corpse recovery from the upper level is a snap
as well, for the same reasons.

If the Cenobite is up, one of its drops is the
Lizard Blood Potion, which I just love.  It's
an INSTANT-cast potion which gates you to the wizard 
pyramid in the Cazic-Thule maze.  This makes it a great
"escape hatch" for any emergency you may someday
find yourself in.  No matter how messy your situation,
no matter how many mobs are beating on you, click
it and you're *GONE*.  I always carry one with me,
just in case.  It has only one charge though,
so use it wisely.  Also be aware that it'll drop
you among a bunch of wandering lizards, so don't
use it if you can't solo the maze trash.  It's
quite handy at higher levels, though.

Have fun, the AoF is a great idea for a challenging
mid-level raid.
