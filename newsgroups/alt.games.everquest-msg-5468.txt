??

Enchanter, powerleveled by druid to 29th ..all spell disciplines maxed, all
melee skills maxed, on the way to 34th on her own and doing just fine in
groups or solo..

Rogue ..same as above, powerleveled to 30th ..doin just fine at 39th now
(backstab maxed easily by askin groups hunting reds to practice on)

I have done it with other characters also.. cleric, necro, druid (weird to
powerlevel a druid with a druid) ..I do it by using two accounts, two
computers, two phone lines ..is no big deal and a good way to spend time
when no friends are on or can't sleep late at nite.

I get the impression you have not done any powerleveling of anyone.. as the
one being helped still has to fight and kill the mobs.. and skills go up if
anything faster if you are fighting yellows and reds.
Any caster with a pet class can max any spell discipline in half an hour or
less by casting on their pet.

My wizard has not been powerleveled at all ..I rarely play him and he's
still up to 22nd ..so far he levels very fast on his own in any group.. I
get a huge kick out of assisting the puller and blasting an overpull to
death at the pullers feet. Rest of the time he either meds or when FM uses
one nuke when the mob is over half dead. (typical smart wizard stuff.. I
dont pull mobs onto the dress wearin panzy wizard :)
