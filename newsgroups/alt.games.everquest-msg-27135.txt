All melee/hybrid classes get damage bonuses to their primary hand (or
two-handed) weapon starting in the late 20's.  The damage bonuses for
two-handed weapons are larger than those for one-handed weapons.  The
slower the weapon, the larger the bonus.  Maybe this is what your groupmate
meant?

However, if your groupmate was claiming there was a paladin-specific
bonus - that a paladin would do 1.5x the amount of damage of a same-level
warrior with the same weapon... he's smoking some really strong crack.
