Well, it did have the original dungeon xp modifier, and now it has the
underused dungeon bonus.  I also find that mobs of level <foo> in
Kedge are easier to kill than the same level mob in other dungeons.

Yep, but other than treehouse in SK and some dungeons with buggy
aggro, when else did you really have to deal with Z axis in the old
world?

I have never seen KK populated, at least not on Innoruuk.  I have
friends who made 50 pre-Kunark who spent a lot of time there, and even
then it was generally 1 or 2 groups at peak times.  I tried soloing
there at about 30, had a hard time breaking the ent spawn, but was
able to do so to a certain extent.  The only folks I ever saw in there
besides myself were guilds powerleveling twinks.

The thing about Kedge is that all the normal dungeon rules you've
learned at that point don't help a damn bit when the cleric loses EB
and the whole party dies.  Now you have to get an EB caster with fish
scales to even allow you to attempt to recover your corpse, and if you
are anywhere other than right at the zone, it can take a lot of work
to get your corpse, drag it to zone, and loot it before EB wears off.
Oh, and there are those nice mobs in there that love to cast dispell,
no EB for you.
If you are able to get a fishbone earring/singing steel gloves/nifty
fishing pole/other EB item, it's the best zone in the game for
35-45ish groups.  Hell, even a mage who doesn't mind making a few
waterstones for the group will work.  The drops aren't nearly as good
as they were pre-Kunark, but there are still some nifty items there,
and the xp just rolls in.  Of course until it really greened out for
me I would NEVER say it was anything other than a deathtrap; keep the
riff-raff out.  Probably the nicest thing about Kedge is that you
NEVER had to deal with dOOdz spamming OOC and shout with their asinine
comments.  Plus, Phinny is a truly awesome looking creature, who
*still* gives one of the toughest 1-2 group fights in the game.
Trying to get him without an enchanter is as hard as any fight I've
had with a single group.
