Well that's a great question and I really wish I could answer it.  I am 
playing a bard, just dinged 16, and am duel wielding myself.  I wanted to DW 
a short type staff along with a dagger or something when I realized I do not 
even have staff or Bo in my skill profile.  So thinking maybe I needed to 
start off using one I created a second character with the intention of 
starting off using a staff or Bo.  Problem was right after completing the 
tutorial I went to the noob island merchant and found I did not even qualify 
for the lowliest staff.  Now with today's patch they have started advancing 
different skills during and after battle (until today you were just advanced 
in many skills at "mini-dings" and when acquiring a new level.  I have even 
had someone tell me that if staff / bo is not in my skill set then my class 
is not eligible, but according to the EQII site scouts are.  So at this 
point I'm trying to figure it out myself.
