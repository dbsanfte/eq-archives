Yes, that is the way it works.

I have never tried pet pulling in a hard, mostly because I haven't done that
many hards.  I think the key would be buffing the pets hp as much as you
could and give him spirit of shrew.  Considereing in LDoN I am using the
level 49 pet with 2300 hit points, even then he might not make it back to
the group, but if you were willing to sacrifice a pet every time you needed
to pet pull, you could probably use him as a way to split groups of mobs by
getting the closest one to run far enough away from the rest that you could
aggro it without the others.

Again, I am interested in hearing about other people's uses of this ability.
