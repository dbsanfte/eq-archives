I have a Voodoo 3 and recently downloaded a utility for overclocking it. I was
wondering whether doing this would have a significant effect on my EQ life,
improving on the choppiness of certain zones and so on?.
My entire system, except maybe the CPU needs an overhaul really but im keen on
the idea of tweaking and tuning to get the best out of what i have before I
move on.
Also, does anybody know a safe level to push this card to? I began by whacking
it up to 266 mhz and it threw a fit. A friend far more knowledgeable about such
things than myself laughed and said unless I had some liquid nitrogen to cool
the thing it would never run at that speed and suggested around 180. Im
hesitant about pushing it again now though because fixing my computer when the
display has gone AWOL took some very lateral thinking indeed ;)

cheers for any help.
