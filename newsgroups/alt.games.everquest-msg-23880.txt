Exactly.. just because the regular news doesn't have enough balls to
report this kind of stuff, doesn't mean it doesn't go on. Personally,
I think Hal Turner is doing the right thing by announcing these
stories, not caring who he offends. News is news, no matter if a
minority OR a white person commits it, and thus should be reported, no
cover-up just cause you're a minority.
