While wandering the sewers under the city of Qeynos, I found something I
hadn't noticed before.

In the room where the 'sewer sentinals' are (Qeynos good guards) is a fire
pot of Erudite style and design.  When I click on it, it gives the message,
"It's locked, and you're not holding the key."

Does anyone know what this opens up or where it leads to?

I was thinking of bringing my rogue down there to practice his Pick Locks
for a bit, but didn't want to find myself attacked by the guards in the room
for trying, nor would I like to find myself transported to someplace like
Paineel or Ogguk.
