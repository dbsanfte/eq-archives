Thanks for posting that, it was a great story.

And I know what you mean about the saver part...I'm a pack rat myself but
finally had to let go of some of my old boxes and software a number of
months ago since it was getting to be too much.  It was painful in certain
respects thinking about the memories associated with some of the games and
remembering that my parents bought me some of them.  I'm just in the process
now of getting rid of some more older software, which also has not been easy
from a personal standpoint.  Ah well, I too had lots of fun and memories
with certain games.
