*sigh*
Alright, I may have picked a bad example, but my point is still valid.
If None's post was in jest, I apologize, but it didn't come across that
way.  With all the tripe going on about 'selling my time' and other
BS, I may be a bit too quick on the trigger.   People who argue the
exact letter of the law to circumvent or trivialize the intent of the law
irritate me.  (Yes, I know. It's not a law it's a EULA).  It's the same
juvenile tripe I hear from teenagers (read 'children') who can't get their
way.

Yes, None, you are correct.  Verant put the action channel
and the trade window in the game as a big plot to ban people
stupid enough to use them.  As a matter of fact, the whole coin
system (platinum, gold, silver, copper) is just a big trap.  It fact the
whole EQ server based economy is one big entrapment scheme.
