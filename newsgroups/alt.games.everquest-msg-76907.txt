I had this same problem as well.  Recently I was heading there and it
zones me out to TD and then as you said, flashes up a couple lines of
chat and then "LOADING, Please Wait...." and then after a minute or so
I was back to desktop.  Did it 3 times in a row.  

Problem was I was only running on 64 megs of RAM as I was waiting on
my 256 stick to arrive.  Since installing the 256 things work fine and
it is incredible how much faster I zone=)  Everywhere=)
