Hehe... if I'm pulling for a group, there's a fun trick for if/when Harmo
song is resisted.

Let's say I've got five mobs following me back toward the group in an
outdoor zone.  I don't run TO the group - instead, I run to within bowshot.
As I approach the group, I tell them to pick the straggler; then I hit the
one I want them to grab with snaresong.  The mob I snared drops behind the
pack, since it's at walking speed for the next 12 seconds.  The tagger need
only wait for the snared mob to drop out of aggro range of the group, then
tag and pull.  I put myself into a holding patter - large circles - and keep
the next 4 pulls busy chasing me while the group kills the straggler; when I
get an XP message it's time to have an encore performance.
