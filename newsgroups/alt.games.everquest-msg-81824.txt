Jerv, jerv, jerv...

It's nice playing with you down here in the shallow end of the pool, but
if this is the best you can offer, I'm afraid we'll have to call the
lifeguards to help you out before you hurt yourself.

I note that you haven't been able to offer anything substantive to the
discussion that was proceeding before you snurfed awake and started
peeing everywhere. But why would that be new?

As for sly, the closest you could get to that would be to listen to your
well-worn 8-track of the Family Stone.

Gentlemanly... <snerk> You? The florid yet clumsy name-caller? The
diversionary yet unfocussed specialist? The wobbly meat that tries to
sound erect? You? Gentlemanly? Hee hee hee...

Reasoned? Hee hee hee. You? Reasoned? The logical Pee Wee Herman of
usenet? Reasoned? You? Mister "strings of unrelated clauses", himself?
Mister "loses the way half way through"...? You? Reasoned?

You're a hoot, JPD, and a constant source of effluents. I must commend
you for the sheer volume of your output. Gives us all something to
bypass and lets us exercise our delete keys. A true public service. The
only man in town who generates aerobic posts. Well, maybe Palmer is a
bit better at it, but you're certainly up there with Billy Boy, although
I can't say you're gaining any ground on him.
