The short answer to your question is yes, if you try to log in with the
account and is says "blah blah blah BANNED" it means the account is dead and
buried unless you can get Verant to intervene and revoke the banning,
however, the odds are very good that they'll just tell you "that sucks, buy
a new account".

If however, you log in and it says "blah blah blah SUSPENDED"  then it's a
temporary suspension and by now the account should probably be alive again,
but not paid for.

I got suspended for like 7 days one time, and I still have no idea why, no
one answered my emails with anything other than a form letter, and I got
sick of trying to play phone tag after a while, so I just kept playing after
the suspension.
