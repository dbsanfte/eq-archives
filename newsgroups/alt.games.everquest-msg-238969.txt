Heh, I just compile them.  ((2*damage)+bonus) is the modal damage
of a weapon (on a histogram you can see a dramatic spike at this
number).  Dividing it by the delay gives you a sort of DPS index -
a relative measure of DPS.  Some people multiply this by 10 (the
equivalent of dividing delay by 10 and making it seconds) and call
the number DPS.  I suppose if I found just the right mob a WLK 
would give 21DPS - but real DPS varies so much by level (of mob), which
expansion the mob is from and angle of attack that you might as
well just use a simpler formula and use the result as a measure
of relative power.

My question is partly rhetorical - I'm pretty sure that my information
is correct.  However, if one of the high end players who parses a
bit (martin, that's your cue) has data to prove it wrong, I really want
to know.  I make decisions of the relative worth of things using that
formula.  It's the reason I was so unimpressed with the PVC - With
the same DPS index you lose 5 sta, 35 raw hp, and 3 to fire, cold and
magic.  

That's why I find it odd that anyone considers 20k so low - it's more
than a WLK costs, for an inferior (as far as I can see) weapon.

I just assumed that the price reflected the difficulty in obtaining 
the items necessary to make it, much as Stonehide gear is so expensive,
in part, because it's made from pretty rare elemental drops.

If the PVC was too easy to make then changing the drops, the trivial level,
or the result of the recipe would all, IMO, have been better solutions.
The weapon, in and of itself, is not overpowering by any means, and 
allowing those already in game to stay in game (with manastones, pre-nerf
Guises of the Deceiver etc) would not affect the game one whit.  

As it is, SOE has screwed people who bought the item legitimately - the
second time in this expansion people have gotten screwed who were not
cheating or exploiting anything.  This marks a very worrisome trend, in
my opinion.
