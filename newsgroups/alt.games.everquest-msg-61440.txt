Speaking of overzealous.

Tailoring sucks, to do the 6th Coldain Prayer shawl you have to get
tailoring up and the easiest way to get 150+ is by making WUs armour from
spider silk. Best place IMHO for spider silk has got to be East Karanas off
the carrion and Crag spiders. I have been killing away for a while with
others hunting also and all been chatting in /ooc. This morning I have an
idiot screaming that he was camping the spiders. What spiders camp I asked?
He was claiming that he was camping the entire zones spiders and that I was
stealing his kills. That's what you call overzealous ;-)
