}- Added gnome cultural recipe book to Ak'Anon.

Woohoo!  I went to Ak'anon and got the book, it details making imbued 
gears, which are then used to make chain watchman armor for gnomish rogues 
and something called Observer plate.  Could this be caster-wearable plate 
look?  That would be sweet!

It was a little unclear from the book if the final combines were smithed 
or tinkered.  Probably tinkered, though.  Yet another motivator to get 
cracking on that again! :)
