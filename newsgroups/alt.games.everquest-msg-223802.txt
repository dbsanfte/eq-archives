I had to do the test of patience 3 times, or rather start it 3 times, as 
the first 2 I got chased off by killer sharks that refused to believe I 
was invisible to animals.

On a better note, if they should determine it is a bug, you will likely 
get your tear back.  I had a bug arise during my first Rak attempt, and 
had my tear back a few days later. In the meantime, I had gone back to 
fear gotten a new tear, and failed the Rak fight due to using the mage 
pet strategy, and they still gave me a replacement tear for the first 
bugged attempt.  On the third Rak attempt we succeeded, we used an SK to 
tank Rak along with a ranger for DPS, and a few other folks who mostly 
stood around and watched, aside from the healers.
