With tradeskills in general there is ALWAYS a 5% failure rate (or at least
pretty close to the 5%) even on stuff trivial 100 points below your skill.
However, with stuff that you have JUST trivialed (ie something that trivials
at 90 and you just hit 91 skill) you'll see a good bit of fails still until
you gain another 20 or so skill points (this has been observed rather
consistently at www.eqtraders.com)
