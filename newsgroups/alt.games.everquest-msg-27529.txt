Casting drowsy on the mob and then healing as necessary sounds like a
good plan to me.

I would have guessed that after a few mobs you would also get a feel
as to how long you have to med between pulls and how much healing per
type of mob you need to do.

Then you might have been able to start the process of debuff, heal,
med to a know point and melee then med ..... staying ahead of the mana
drain from a tank is a good plan - then you dont have to worry about
them pulling if you are lom or oom.
