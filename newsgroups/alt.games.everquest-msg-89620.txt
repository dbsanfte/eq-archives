Oddly enough, I started on the Millers exactly at 25. They're yellow at
that point, and can be a chore, but it's doable. You just have to make
sure you have the TOP level pet you can get and split them well. I found
that casting ST on Chandra get's Baobob running in that weird pathing
route out into the field. Then you just FD and he'll stand there for a
while till you are ready to pull him. I usually pull them up onto the
slope to the right as you are facing Surefall. Careful of their bugged
pathing. If you cast on them from there and don't run a ways out into
the field, they will take off and run down the road most of the way to
Qeynos for some fucked up reason and not come back.

Oh, and watch out for Chandra. That backstab is ugly. Her brother is a
gimp, though, even at 25.
