This say's it all.  I have 4 active characters and yeah, Id love to have
some major money but I can still have a good time without.  As a caster
spells are expensive so most of my money goes there.  I don't buy armor, not
interested in it, I get the job done without (for now)  I also solo a lot
but that includes times where I help break camps for lowbies in the EC or
work on faction quests in Halas (damn barbarians!! ;-p ).  Sure who doesn't
want to be lvl 60 with 100k pp in the bank but I can have a good time like I
am and that's all that matters.

Nubzif EveningShadow lvl 20 Druid (170pp in bank)
Fizbun lvl 15 Mage (10pp on person)
Raiguy lvl 10 Necro (20pp on person)
Nubzuf lvl 7 Warrior (18pp on person)
