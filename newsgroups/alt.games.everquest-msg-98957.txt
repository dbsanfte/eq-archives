Well before this chat feature that warrior in gfay would have been
auctioning before and you wouldn't have known it, right? Cause you are in
Katta and him in Gfay.  Now with chat this can bring the buyer and seller
together, and you have the "option" of finding a way to get there and buy
it, and if it is something you really want/need then I am sure paying
someone for a port would be in line, or doing the Nexus thing.
