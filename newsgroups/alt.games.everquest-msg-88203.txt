Outside of some Uninstall Information entries, I can't find
any EQ-related reg entries on my machine. Well, at least not
when searching for Everquest. Didn't bother to search for EQ,
Verant, Sony, Shadows of Luclin, etc, yada yada yada... EQ
would probably get way too many false positives anyway, heh.

Someone else has already mentioned it, Jazz, but try using
the recommended NVidia drivers. Should fix your problem.
