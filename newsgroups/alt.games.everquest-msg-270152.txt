True. But they still make the distinction fuzzy. A group of six greens
shown to you as solo (but still linked) can still kill you just as a mob
shown as single could wipe a group. If you're particularly low resist a
group of greys could hypothetically take down a PC. (Hypothetically because
I've never seen it. Although I have seen a PC wipe on a group of greens.
And I've personally fallen to a blue solo (Yeah, I know, I suck).
