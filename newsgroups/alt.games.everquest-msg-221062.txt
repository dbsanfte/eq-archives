    Lots of XP-type things out there that those classes cannot efficiently
tank. For example, I'd never accept a ranger tank in Plane of Earth. They
just get owned too fast, and I bleed mana too quickly. So no, I don't see
groups accepting just anyone that can glue a mob to themselves.

    There's nothing easy to nerf about a SK. The big advantage they have
over a warrior, after aggro generation, is DPS, not tankability. And the DPS
they gain is coming from spells and pet, not from weaponry. I'm not sure how
you could reduce their DPS without splitting paladins and shadow knights on
weapons, and then the shadow knights will (rightfully) complain that they're
given the shaft in weaponry compared with paladins. And it'll be very
difficult to get rid of that spell DPS considering that SK's have a
self-only mana regen buff that rivals KEI. I'm honestly stumped as to how
one could tune SK's without messing up some other aspect of "balance".
