Well, it's a matter of luck and my own occasionally abrasive postings I
think.  I was on another group when someone crossposted to that group and to
alt.talk.creationism.  I added the latter group to see what it was all about
and shortly found myself in a couple of debates, to include an ongoing
argument about something completely trivial with this Busterboo person.
Specifically, that Busterboo had said "actually, there is no such thing as
color" and I called her a liar for it.

So this has been going on for about a week, when one of this Busterboo's
friends, with whom I had had an earlier debate, apparently tells her that
you can search a person's posting history in Google, and that you can use
their email address as a search term rather than their nickname. if you
prefer.  All correct so far.  But this "more technologically savvy" friend
seems to have also told the poor thing that the email address cannot be
changed, and also has led her to believe that said email address is unique
in all of Usenet.  So now you can see the kind of idiots I'm dealing with
here, and it probably will not be any wonder to anyone why they gave up the
debate of a subject on its merits in favor of a smear campaign.  Well, I'll
refute the smear campaign with facts as easily as I did the original
assertion Busterboo made to create this confrontation.

1)  This is only personal knowledge, but I know for a fact that I did not
make the post to which Busterboo refers.
2)  I have no posts in all of Google from 1997 because I did not know Usenet
existed until 1999 or later (forgot exactly when)
3)  I have never visited the newsgroup into which the original post was
made, nor could I if I wanted to (which I don't), because Deutche Telecom,
my ISP, does not offer adult oriented newsgroups.  I checked because I
already knew Telecom will not allow replies to some newsgroups from which
some crosspostings are made -- groups such as alt.politics.usa thrive on
crossposts, but my replies don't go to all the original newsgroups because
Telecom doesn't host them.
4)  joe@noname.com is an obvious choice of email address for someone to put
into Outlook if they don't want their true email address known.  It is not
unique at all, so any number of people can and probably do use it.
5)  Even though Busterboo's stupid friends told her that the email address
"doesn't lie" which is false anyway, if it were true it would be 100% proof
that the poster to the adult newsgroup was not me, as his/her address was
Joe@noname.com, with a capital J.  Even such a small change in email address
is, to believe those fools, impossible, so the other guy could not be me.

So, having said all this, all I can suggest for the rest of you, should this
idiot keep posting here, is that you killfile her.  As for me, I'm not sure
if I have a valid complaint, but it is disturbing to me that Busterboo is
posting adult oriented material into a games related newsgroup.  Seeing as
Busterboo is apparently stupid enough to use her real email address (from
AOL), I plan to complain to AOL as well as to Google, through which she made
the post.  If neither can or will do anything about it, no loss for me.  But
if they will, maybe Busterboo will think twice about making false
accusations like this again.
