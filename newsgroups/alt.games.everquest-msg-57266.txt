Although I agree that everyone should be able to use languages as he she
pleases, it does get on my nerves when I see my textbox being littered by
different languages. Every other line I couldn't understand and what really
had me puzzled was that some of those were written in capitals. It might
have been something important, or it might have been just a heated argument.

It might mean that if there is a train coming to a certain spot and it's
pronounced in French or Italian or such, half or more of the people have no
clue what's about to hit them. And if you speak your native language all the
time then it would be an easy mistake to make.
