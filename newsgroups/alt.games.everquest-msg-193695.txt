G'luck on the move, sweet Annie. Tell Lennie I wish him well in the job 
market, etc. San Diego is an overpriced hell hole anyway, no loss there. 
(Least it was when I lived there in the eighties. Might have changed.) 
Enjoy the south. The winter weather up here is making me think of 
heading that way myself for my own retirement.
