The main problem is resists, particularly to your color spells, and
particularly when you have multiple mobs on you for whatever reason. Given
sufficient time, I like to tash mobs and then color stun and then move on to
mez or root or whatever. Textbook stuff. However, depending on the type of
place you hunt, things may not work that way. If you start with only half
hp, get jumped by three mobs, tanks already fighting, cleric busy, no time
for tashing, two stun and one resists and then again resists your next color
in the chain...well, it may not be a pretty picture. Enchanters go down very
fast and have little time at best when things don't go quite right.
Obviously there may be lots of options but they're all limited by the amount
of hp you have available to handle the problem.

Areas where the pathing brings lots of fresh mobs or where pulls are often
multiples are challenging and fun. The group is really busy with everyone
having a blast. A scenario such as above --where the enchanter or the cleric
suddenly finds themself the center of mob attention --- isn't uncommon.

I agree with your statement, chanters are great satisfaction. For me this is
particularly true when I can play in situations where I am really busy and
not just sitting around keeping up buffs and providing an occasional mez or
stun.  When things are really busy, you don't want to always look up and
find you hp bar half empty ( half full?).
