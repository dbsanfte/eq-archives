I would think this is intended more for day to day xp use than
for raid encounters.

I worry about lag with this - How long to do openings last?  In a
laggy situation, how possible is it for the melee to miss the 
opening?  Any rogue who has manuevered to the back of a mob, hit
his BS button only to have the mob moved so he "Can't see his
target" will appreciate this potential problem.

OTOH - anything to make pure melee a bit more effective - but
only if they are paying attention - sounds good.  I've already
seen comments about hybrids "being left out".  Well, I have
plenty to do with my BL - spells, my positioning and my pet's
positioning all keep me plenty busy.
