Actually, there are many aa's that aren't worth getting, even if you are
out of decent ones.  Turn Summoned comes to mind.  Elemental Agility 
2 and 3 are also worthless, as they add no benefit over 1 at the moment.
Frenzied Burnout adds 700 damage every 72 minutes - also completely 
worthless.  Don't forget +stats for various classes (IE +wis for mages
would be a waste of 15 points)
