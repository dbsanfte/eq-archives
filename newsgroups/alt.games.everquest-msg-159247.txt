At what level should a Druid or Wizard start trying to quad-kite?

I have a Wood Elf Druid (currently only lvl 10) that I haven't used in a
while that I'm thinking of playing as again, and have been considering
starting a Gnome Wizard, now that I can get him the hell away from Akanon
thanks to PoP.(I like to play with the sound on, and that constant ticking
in Akanon drives me nuts)

I've watched a lot of Druids quad-kite, and it looks like fun. Had a good
laugh last night with my Magician in DSP, watching a Druid with a few
doggie-trains (several kited Wolves) following him around.

May end up just sticking with my Ranger, though. I love bow-kiting, if I can
get a SoW to do it better, that is. (I mainly bow-kite against yellows or
anything that has close-range poison or disease attacks, and only use
Archery to pull, otherwise)
