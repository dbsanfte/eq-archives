That wasn't the point I was addressing. Handing in Deathfist Belts to Budo
is now a problem. I was still well inside on the *Runnyeye side* when she
saw me through the arch, rooted me, double nuked for 180+. I spent the
better part of the night wishing Budo would make a run through the wall like
he normally does so I could hand in belts.
