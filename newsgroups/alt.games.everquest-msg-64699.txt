Want to see something really freaky?  If your video behaves
like mine, go swimming in that video mode -- your view
will still be pitch black.

NOW, hit "i" for inventory.  Bingo, not only can you see,
but the entire underwater vista will be CRYSTAL CLEAR.
You'll be able to see from one end of the lake to the
other, and the entire lake/ocean bed will be as visible
as if they had drained all the water out.

Handy, actually...  But I suspect it's a clue as to
exactly what manner of screwup accounts for the "black"
problem.
