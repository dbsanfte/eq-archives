Yeah,Yeah.
We should also all get Kei(Caster) and Haste(Melee) from the day of
birth.
This is a ROLE playing game,Characters need something to be 
distinguished from each other.

Maybe you played another game,are you sure it was EQ?
Really suprises me,that you as a long time EQ player does not know
how to avoid downtime.So instead of re-thinking your strategy you
decided its better to cry for all handed to you on a silver plate by
SOE,nice,I really have no sympathy.

So you have this nice Staff,but no idea how to avoid downtime,weird.

Guess I read to much the SOE boards lately(sadly not much traffic here
the last year(s)),but all this whining there for give me this give me
that,but dont dare to take away anything from my class made me 
somewhat annoyed.
