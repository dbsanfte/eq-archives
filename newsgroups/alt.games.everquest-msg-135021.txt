Strangely, when I attempted to research -your- maxim, I found support for 
nearly the exact opposite being true.

http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/ad-hominem.html

Ie, if we assume for the moment that your accusation that I had made an ad 
hominem attack was legitimate, that neither proves nor disproves your 
argument.  It therefore would fail to support my position, but it does not 
negate my position either.  But then, that's logic, and not USENET.

I might also point out, that as stated, your maxim would require you to 
prove that I had no course other than the ad hominem attack available, 
before you could declare yourself victor.  You could greaty strengthen 
your maxim by (A) dropping the word 'must', and (B) spelling 'attacks' 
correctly.

However, I did find a reference supporting your maxim.
http://www.killfile.org/~tskirvin/faqs/godwin.faq

I think their wording is better still.

}USENET...

Now you have.  Mmm... 16 or 17 years for me.  Took a couple long breaks 
though.

}Care to point to the reference??

No, not especially.  But you may find searching google for the words 
"debate" and "usenet" and the phrase "declares victory" instructive.  
Whether or not it is an "accepted maxim" (which I will hereby indicate my 
acceptance of), there is plenty of evidence that it is what happens.

}>Why?  Up there, you're talking about personal attacks.  There's no 
}>personal attack here, just a simple statement of fact.
}No, it's an opinion..
}If I were to say you are a complete and utter asshole, because you
}cannot debate in an adult and mature manner w/o resorting to personal
}attacks,  would that be an opinion or a fact??

Well, depends on whether you could find any supporting evidence to 
actually back that up.

If it encourages you in your search for such evidence, it is 
unquestionably a fact that I was, at one time at least, an asshole.  
Professional, even.

You may have a great deal of trouble proving the negative in the second 
half of your assertion, though.

}Illiterate??
}Oh and that is not a personal attack..

No, it wasn't.  On the other hand, you do seem to be showing the rudiments 
of logic again, and possibly comprehension, in other parts of this thread, 
so I'll retract it.  Just try not to lapse so far again. <eg>

}Well, congrats, RS... You get to join Lena in my MKF..  :^) 

A strange assertion.  I was going to assume 'MKF' was some sort of 
killfile, but I notice you've been following up to posts I've made since 
receiving this one, which would tend to give the lie to that idea.  Please 
explain.

}So sad, you actually had potential.  But I insist on adult mature
}debates where I can match wits and not have to worry about being
}called names like "clueless" or "illiterate".

Err... EQ?  This is USENET.  If that's really what you're looking for, 
you're (A) really, -really-, in the wrong place, and (B) even less likey 
to find that in widely crossposted threads.

}>}>}>}then I would (respectfully, of course) suggest you
}>}>}>}choose them with more care...
}>}>}>}Just a suggestion..

May I just point out as well, that were we to use your apparent standard 
for "a personal attack", I should have counted this as an attack on my 
writing style.  Thus, by your own logic, you had already lost.
