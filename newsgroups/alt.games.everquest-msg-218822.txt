Jekke
/tell 2 Cheal in 10 secs.
Eight seconds pass.
/tell 2 Oh shit!  I just remembered I'm actually in trader mode at the
bazaar.  MA out of range.  nm.

Everyone one else in /2
/tell 2 WTF???
/tell 2 Next cleric...cast cast cast!
/tell 2 Wait, I'm confused, I am the next cleric now?
/tell 2 MA is at 7% someone cast SOMETHING NOW

Rest of raid spent with panicking clerics madly casting SupHeals and
HoTs and cussing at each other and Jekke as they try to set up a CHeal
rotation while the MA stays at 3%.... OR... all clerics cast CHeal at
the same time....then there is a pretty random casting of HoT, Supheals,
and Cheals at they try to set up a new rotation.

Personally, I think that you should have gotten DPKs and the chance to
roll on anything you wanted that dropped.  Just because you were clearly
there in spirit.
