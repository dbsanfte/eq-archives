There's also, with some compilers, padding for alignment, which is sometimes
uninitialized in the file.

At work occasionally we'll have to rebuild some old release, and, of course,
we want to verify that we really are working with the right source, so we'll
build and compare to a copy of the old release.  The way I get around those
annoying per-build differences is by building the thing three or four times,
and comparing them.  If the differences between the three or four new builds
are in the same places as the differences between those and the old build
I'm trying to reproduce, I consider it a match.

I also submit a bug report when I encounter compilers that have this
problem.  Not initializing things is just sloppy, and timestamps should be
optional.
