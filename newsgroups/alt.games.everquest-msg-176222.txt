Or, more likely from what I've been observing, one of the 30PP sellers
has bought all yours and marked them up to 30 for resale. No sense
turning down a 10PP each profit while avoiding that wait for yours to
get sold out before he can sell his.

I had run into a similar thing back when the PoTC craze was in full
swing. My guild was one of the ones that did the "team effort" to get
everyone those earrings. My part turned out to be the fishing part. I
maxxed fishing skill and went into production. Well, I was soon cranking
out more of the fishing poles than were needed in my guild at the time,
so I took to selling extras in the bazaar.

I determined that I could sell them around 1.4K PP and still make a very
hefty profit, though I saw others selling for 2K. They seemed content to
wait until mine were sold or I wasn't online and sold theirs afterwards.

But after a bit, I saw that I had sold three poles in a row to the same
guy. Sure enough, when I checked, he was selling poles for 1.7K and
undercutting the 2K sellers also. The thing is, I only every put one or
two poles on my trader at a time, though I had about a dozen in the
bank. I had two days of great fun where I would log on the mule, put a
pole on, wait for him to buy it and mark it up, then put another on, and
another.... rinse repeat. He eventually stopped buying mine and had
about a half dozen poles that he was going to make next to nothing on,
while I still had poles that got sold to random folks doing the quest
(or so I assume) at 1.4K.

Now the bottom has fallen out of that market, and I don't even bother
anymore.
