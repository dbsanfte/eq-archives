Hello, this is the first time I've had the opportunity to try to log in 
since the last patch. I can't get into the game because whenever the 
patcher runs I get this:

  Beginning Download.
  Receiving File eqgame.exe...
(30 minutes of an estimated 1hr30min to completion go by)
  File input error. The file download may be
  corrupted. Please notify <eqtech@soe.sony.com>

Of course I have notified eqtech@soe.sony.com but don't have a whole lot 
of hopes of an exceptionally prompt response and I would kinda like to 
play now if there's anything I can possibly do. Can anyone give me some 
guidance as to what is going on here?

Thanks,
Kris
