My wife plays an Iksar SK, and says the following about this -

By itself, it isn't all that great, except for the fairly long
duration for yourself.  Combined with Siphon Str and Despair on the
same mob, it is deadly.  A mana drain, but it does allow a 26 SK
(mostly untwinked) to solo MS against Rockhoppers... all of which are
yellow or higher.

And at low levels, it seems to be the highest taunt value spell she
has.  And she has not seen it resisted on anything lower con than
yellow, and only once on a red con.  So it does have value to her...
and the vendor isn't all that out of the way... especially if one
binds in SH... Just go through the door, zone, hang a right at the 4
way, and there you are.
