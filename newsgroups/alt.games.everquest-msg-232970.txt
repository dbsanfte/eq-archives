I seem to recall EQ having lots of problems with certain firmware 
revisions on Linksys routers. A Google search for "linksys" and 
"everquest" is returning thousands of hits, some of them very recent, so 
you can probably find relevant info and help that way.

I don't know your specific model, but this page in particular may be of
