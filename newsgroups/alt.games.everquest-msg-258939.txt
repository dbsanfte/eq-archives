Well mid 20's can kill it, so id question what kind of underpowered force
was involved. I mean, if its 1-2 groups, thats hardly a raid =)  But 4
groups is enough, and like you say.. the fight itself is pretty simple and
easy - everything bad that happens isnt lethal, and is learned in a way that
you won't wipe the first time each happens.. just react and factor it in.
Even a missed heal or 5 isnt cause for wipe, his melee dps is pretty weak
(we've never lost a tank to him, which is like an extreme rarity!) and as a
perma rooted mob, it removes any difficulties in the next tank gaining agro
at a very fast speed.

AoW is on a pretty short timer.  Generally theres time for 2 real attempts,
so that rules out guildB letting you wipe to it all night and then swoop in
to kill it.   I think it was pretty common occurance across servers that if
2 guilds were contesting AoW, whoever killed Vindi (thus starting the
"linear" event of killing) would get first dibs on Statue, Idol, and AoW.
If you wiped on AoW though, you can bet your life that the rival guild sat
across the arena would pull it once he reset.

Arguably its a scripted event.. you killed Idol (statue+vindi) to trigger
him.. but guilds who pulled AoW after the first guild wiped were not
petitioned, they werent reprimanded or told off.. honestly guilds who
complained about guild B doing that were just naive (speaking as somebody
who had that happen, of course we were pissed.. but nothing was "illegal" to
cry to gms about)

I remember this one, you posted it a bit incorrectly though =)
Blood is a seperate mob in addition to being the emp trigger.. yes your
killing of blood would enable you the first stab at Emp, but if you wipe on
emp the other guild would be well within their rights to take the spawn
(probably rezzing you in and getting you out of the chamber to get you out
of the way)

It was cursed that you guys were triggering and they killed, but their
defence was they killed 50% of the triggers too, and they killed the final
trigger that resulted in Gylphed spawning.  We can only speculate what the
gm's would of done.. because it would be very difficult to prove you killed
all the triggers, and they stole the subsequent scripted named.  Infact, I
doubt they were lieing (about killing some of the triggers) so the question
of who was entitled to the script is a very dubious grey area... I would
guess had a gm intervened before the named were killed, he would make both
guilds random for the rights to the G/E/C spawns.

CiH fucked themselves with the emp behaviour though... while I think you
guys were maybe a bit unethical, contributing in a cockblock of their emp
kill, its not against any game rules to try an event and lose. Though it
does become contentious when you factor in it IS against rules to trigger
events with the intention of blowing the spawn to delay/stop another guild.
It takes common sense to decide when this is the case though... in the days
that Statues death spawned AoW, it wasn't against any rule that a guild
could kill Statue for his loot, even though their force was in no way
adaquate for killing AoW.
Killing the Coirniav trigger with the excuse of wanting elemental molds
however (with no force or effort to kill the fish itself)... well any clued
up gm wouldn't accept that.  Killing blood for his loot and leaving emp
(thus blowing the spawn for 4? hours) is borderline i guess.  I doubt gm's
would ever take action against a guild who did this (unless of course they
did it every single week for a long time)... but it does fall foul of the
"whats cool" good sporting conduct between guilds.

You can say Blood had good loot, but the reality was the main reward from
killing Blood was to spawn Emp (and get his loots).. they were more "heres
some loot for your troubles" when Emp was a pretty difficult encounter.  If
you killed blood more than once and delayed CiH then it doesnt take a brain
surgon to conclude they feel you are griefing them... you are just doing it
in a more sneaky and difficult way than what they did (breaking mezzes and
blocking portals is so fucking obvious, they deserved the zone ban just for
being so god damn stupid)

Yeah it was pretty infamous on the FoH boards too. Seethar was it? Something
like that... I remember it getting moved to the retard forum and much
teasing of him did commence.

They found an unengaged mob, at 100%, which hadnt required a difficult or
complex script to spawn it... whilst i agree it is a grey area considering
it technically is a scripted event... knowing what exactly Cyno entails, you
guys were incredibly naive to think they wouldn't kill it. (And dare i say,
cry babies for petitioning when they did so).  Don't get me wrong, im not
going to justify their ooc or taunts in tells etc, that shit is just
retarded and goes some way to justify what people think of them... but it
does seem a little less naivety on your part might reduce the friction
between both guilds.

Thats the difficult part though =)  Running to Qvic naked is pretty risk
free, but getting from Qvic zonein to Cynosure through the 20-30 Kyvs and
other assorted trash?  its by no means trivial.. even with (naked) bards
selos/da and the like, shifting the trash to a) live to reach cyno and b) do
so without agro to be able to rez is not a mere few minutes process.  The
cynosure pit and surrounding "ruins" (not really sure what you'd call that)
arent particularly safe either, most sides have  mobs inside that will agro,
indeed the only safe wall has an entry just a few yards from a mob (who most
people would agro).  And even then, assuming you make it to the safe wall
inside the ruins unagrod, there is the matter of static spawns on the very
other side of the wall (which sooner or later will agro onto your raid)

If I had to give a realistic time for how long such a CR would take, I would
say 30 minutes.  Add in medding and buffing, thats another 10 minutes, if
you CR'd to a safer part of the zone (e.g alongside one of the safe
buildings) then add in another 10 mins clearance... were talking 50 minutes
from time of wipe to being ready to re-engage the mob. I think any claims
you had to that mob expired 45 mins earlier...

That also doesnt go into the fact you wiped in the first place because you
were very underpowered.  Its not conceivable to assume your force would
still be underpowered to kill it... afterall if you trigger it with 12
people, then blow 1 hour while another 40 of your guild logs on.. that opens
up another can of worms that is actionable by GMs (if you don't have the
force ready, you can't trigger it and stall while you wait for a force to
log on)

Well I guess they figured one good deed deserves another... if they CR'd
your wipe, you wouldn't cry to GM's that they didnt wait xxx amount of time
for it to fully recycle.  I don't see it as a dead simple issue, because I
don't think its a scripted event in the sense that Bertox, RZtW and other
such events are scripted.  There is no challenge in starting the trigger,
there is zero possibility they would of wiped on triggering the mob, so all
they did was saved some time.  The same kind of time saving had you cleared
a temple to pull Mnat, wiped, and they took advantage of the cleared temple
to jump straight to the named.  I mean you wouldn't expect them to wait for
yard trash to respawn right?  Because yard trash is exactly what I would
class Cynosures "guards" as.

Also do not forget, Cynosures death is a requirement for them to zone into
Inktu'ta.  If they are unable to progress because a mini roadblock is using
15 people to claim the Cynosure script and repeatedly wiping... well they'd
be quite justified in getting some form of GM intervention on their behalf
to make YOUR guild move aside after the wipe proves your force is
inadaquate.  Like I said previously though, some/most GM's just don't
understand how higher end GoD works, they have no clue how Cynosure and Zun
Muram works in opening up instances or how the events are scripted

Impolite, sure.  But if their raid is sat ready to engage, lets you take a
shot (which you subsequently wipe from), then they have a rightful claim to
the next attempt of the mob.  You have a duty to honour their claim, and the
CRing you in was a "were not really assholes, we helped you out!" while they
then proceed to kill your target.  Nice? Probably not.  Allowed? Why the
hell not.

Did you honestly send the petitions after they bragged and sent links?  That
reeks of vengeance not fighting in the name of truth and honour.. =)

Or just learn to keep their mouths shut (no abuse, no broken mez messages
etc).. no reportable proof, then proceed to pay you back, eye for eye,
vengeance style =)

I dont think its a courtesy you are owed though.  Being the first to a mob
doesn't entitle you to endless tries, or the right to cockblock another
guilds progression.  Being first there entitles you to the FIRST try - you
had the first try. Thats where their obligation to you ends.

I mean don't get me wrong, its not a nice situation to be in.  FCFS does
have a certain element of adrenalin and excitement to it.. but lets face it,
most of the time it results in drama and headaches.  From a background of
full out FCFS (if you wipe to AoW the other guild will pull it from your
corpses, after lagging you out with their zerg raid, and asking you not to
rez back in so their try is lag free heh) to a server of pretty mutual
respect and rotations (if our rivals were forming in an open zone... e.g
Natimbi for Crag Beast Queen, and wiped, we wouldnt move into the zone and
take the named, either the current or next pop, while their force remained
in the zone.  Likewise if we wiped, they wouldn't form and fight over our
corpses.. we have rotations for potime, qvic, txevu)... i know which kind I
prefer =)

You didn't have the neck at this point though!  So it would of been a loss
of healing focus (in the non direct fast casting sense) for minor stat
upgrades and 5% more extended buffs.

Seeing merit and DKP in place, im not really a fan of merit anyway... but
linking current items definately seems a better method.  Comparing magelos
is difficult and time consuming, and doesn't allow for ingame debate of
peoples items in slots without asking the people for item links anyway!

Well noq summons, and would run after the SK were he to over agro (and then
banish the SK)

Strong root is 1 hour reuse, how many wizards attend your raids?! =)
That seems a very long winded strat that isnt actually doing shit for you...
I mean every time a real noq dies and they reset, they are both unagrod and
simply require a warrior in place to grab the agro.  Im sure your tanks
wield the same weapons ours do, so agro isnt really a problem.. and after
the first split, your strat would just result in a summoned SK anyway (and
if the clerics are healing him, whats the point of the warrior?)

Also the basic fact that 1 damage proc will break root, and almost every
nuke will break the root... what exactly is the strong root strat trying to
achieve?

-m <-- bored at work, can you tell? =)
