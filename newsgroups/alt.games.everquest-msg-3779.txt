At this point, I'd have to wonder if we're playing the same game.

The shops haven't changed since they were added.  I'm not sure they could even
change the zones such as you suggest, at this point.  Unless you mean just
some random vendor now spawning somewhere in an empty corner of town.  GM
Events as you speak of in Ill Omen, happen once in a blue moon.  With all the
static spawns and such,  I'd have to say EQ has the most static game world of
any online game I have ever purchased.

In any event, it's still a good purchase.   If I'm not playing an online game,
I'll generally go through a single player game every month or two.   Playing
an online game I don't need to buy any.   So I pay $10 a month instead of $40.
