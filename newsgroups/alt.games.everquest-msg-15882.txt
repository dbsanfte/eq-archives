Of the 6 to 10 people I have tried to con into grabbing EverQuest, all of
them - not one or two, all of them - asked almost immediately about players
killing other players. All were relieved that players could not do so (or be
killed) without consent.

I have been playing video games for longer than I care to admit and love a
good multi-player fight. (TeamFortress Classic is among my favorites of the
last year or two) But because I have to pay a fee to play EQ, because of the
massive time sink that is the game, because I know how irritating teenage
boys can be when they want to ruin the game for another, the lack of
nonconsensual PvP was *integral* to my decision to buy EverQuest.

When I want to play that kind of game, I do. Whereas it's probably true that
there are many players to whom it would not matter, one would guess that the
PvP servers would be bursting at the seams if PvP action was what people
wanted.
