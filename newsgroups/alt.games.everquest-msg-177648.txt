Ah, sorry, though the necro was your main, gomen.

Personally, I prefer to solo.  I don't have to put up with utter idjots,
loot-whores, jackasses who don't understand their class at level 45, and all
the other icky consequences of playing with the least common denominators.
Soloing at the DL spires, I left OOC and Shout on, just to remind myself why
I solo.  Oddly enough, even as a Paladin, I can solo faster than I can level
when grouping.  I figured this out when I went from the Dreadlands Cesspool
Bar and Grill to the Thurgadin mines.  I tell ya, I was in heaven.

My guess is, Verant will make a few kick-ass zones, and then turn around and
ruin them with a few bone-headed moves, like the monster traps, or the Dark
Huntress (speaking of that, the patch message said that she was on the wrong
faction, maybe she wasn't supposed to be KoS to everything?  I'd laugh if
she was meant to be on Bard faction....).  There seems to be an overwhelming
tendancy towards the policy "if you can get XP here, you're too low to
survive here."  That seems to force people into a few select zones.
