There's no such thing as overcrowding on the $9.89 servers...if that's one
of the big reasons you left I have to call you "nuts."  Oh sure, the lemming
dungeons like Velks & Seb might have too many people but with so many other
options available those zones are VOLUNTARILY crowded, unlike the good old
days where the only 40+ zones were SolB and LGuk.

I'm pretty sure it's "ciao."

Thanks for the update though, I'm not going to call you nuts for spending
$40/mo.  I could afford to do it, but I can't see spending $200/mo on EQ (my
3 accounts, and my poor brother's 2 accounts) when I'm having enough fun on
my present server.
