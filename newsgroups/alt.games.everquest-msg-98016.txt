I've had no modifications to any of the settings of EQ, am using a cable
modem, and have not ever had problem (unless I've got my other computer
downloading at speeds of 2.9+ Mbps with cable modem being 3.0 Mbps
connection).
    I am using a router (Linksys) to share my connection though.  Maybe that
could make the difference (EQ losing connection with you but maybe a router
doesn't let that happen as easily???).
