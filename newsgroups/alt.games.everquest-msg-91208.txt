Still got the music-gets-stuck bug like just about every other Soundblaster
user ever since I installed the game (over a year and a half ago).
Sound has been "fixed" a bit in that the stutterings and volume aren't
totally unpredictable anymore. Theyr'e predictable stutterings now.

How about claiming no problems when no person can get on the server and the
ones who do go LD after a couple of minutes? Happend lots of times the past,
oh, year and a half. Getting slightly better, now it's mostly router
problems (all either at the serverfarm or so close they can probably walk to
the site).

No, that's cheating. What Martin means is when you find an efficient way of
using the tools you have it gets called an exploit. A good example is the
Eye of Zomm tactic.

I must agree with that. Although there are many bugs that could've been
prevented or which can reasonably be assumed to be tested (leading industry
brands like GeForces and Soundblasters are aparently not tested, or not
well)

You're kidding right?

Let's see, the past weekend:
Friday: mass linkdeaths, multiple times. Didn't bother to log in after the
4th for me.
Saturday: yet again mass LD's. ping jumping, serverside disconnects (you can
tell from the increased speed before LD's and PL jumping strangely) and due
to lag I saw several guildies get wiped while trying to solo
Sunday: First account simply couldn't log in. Second account had 3 LD's 10
seconds after logging in. After that I had about 3 more LD's during the day.
Login server congested and/or server "down" after every LD and numerous
people across the zones asking if anybody else went LD.

After too many LD's and such I just went back to Unreal Tournament with
practically flawless connections all over the world and pings that don't
screw up. At least I know it isn't MY connection that's screwed up.

The player-count per server was a good indication if something was wrong.
Nowadays you just get told to install all the latest drivers and re-run the
patch update. SOME customer support would be nice; just tell us when things
are going nuts.

Oh well, no point pouring water in the ocean.
