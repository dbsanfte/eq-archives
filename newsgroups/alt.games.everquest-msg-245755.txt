You are arguing the realism line?  Clones have no memory of anything,
thus you should lose all experience when you die.  The game isn't real
enough, it sucks.

Somehow, in EQ, people look past the fact that snakes can't kick and a
pig couldn't take hundreds of arrows to its body before it died and
drops a shield.  That doesn't matter.  What matters is that there is
always something better to work toward, it's easy to make friends with
people, and looting something very nice leads to a real sense of
accomplishment.

Perhaps the game designers went too far, trying to make the game
"realistic".

How about "raiding" an imperial base and obtaining a rare shield
generator or experimental rifle, if "realism" is that important?

This was another problem.  *What* end game content?  I'm sure it was
there somewhere.  But, it's not exactly in the instruction manual and
since I saw maybe a handful of people in guilds, I saw no easy way to
find out about it.  Maybe I started and quit too early but all I saw
was a bunch of chaos.  I saw a whole bunch of people doing their own
solo projects and occaisionally some PvP.

Rarity is the key.
