They've gotten a little sloppy with their drivers lately, but no sloppier 
than ATI, who is legendary for driver screwups. I bought a 9800XT to get the 
latest pixel shader technology and DX9 support a while ago (before the 
nVidia 6800 series came out) and enjoyed the card quite a bit, until Doom3 
came out. It was an unmitigated disaster and was completely unplayable for 
the apparently few of us who were affected by the problem. I had to abandon 
the most recent two driver releases and go back to earlier release, and the 
problem didn't go away, it just mitigated a bit.  I decided to try out the 
new nVidia 6800 and picked up a 6800Ultra. Wow, great card, super 
performance. But ... it causes unbelievable graphics glitches in my current 
favorite game, using those 61.77 drivers that bizbee mentions. I noticed 
that those drivers are certified for DX9c, but haven't been fully tested 
with it so they are not WHQL certified. The 61.76 drivers are WHQL 
certified, but for DX9b, and having installed DX9c already, which is not 
uninstallable (and I didn't create a system restore point before installing 
them), I'm stuck with two choices: use 61.76, which has not been certified 
for DX9c, or use 61.77 which exhibits huge problems in my favorite game.

Like most of these debates, both sides have their good points and their bad 
points. And while I'm sure there are plenty of folks out there who can chime 
in with a post stating "I've had zero problems with my ...", the fact is 
that in all the years of serious gaming that I've enjoyed, my experience is 
that both companies have had their share of driver and hardware issues. The 
only way I've managed to stay ahead of it is to keep ping ponging between 
them and hope you're on the lucky when it comes to playing your favorite 
games.
