I use this same process as you.  Only advantage HoS has is it increases a 
couple hundred HPs.  I feel it's a bigger advantage to my tank to incrase his 
stats way more by using IoS along with my other stat buffs.  Plus now that I 
have Talisman of Kragg I can increase the tanks HPs even more than I could of 
using HoS.  Only time I use HoS now is if someone specifically asks for it.
