This part just kills me. How do you camp a random spawn, that can spawn
anywhere in an outdoor zone at any time?

Camping a mob that has a static spawn point like the AC in OOT makes sense since
it spawns in a set location.

But how do you camp a whole zone? That's like going into SK and saying I'm camping
Coloth Meadowgreen, He's Mine! Uh no sorry if I see him first and I want the Runed
Oak Bow, he's mine I don't care if you've been there for 32 hours. Rare random spawn
with a rare drop is first come first serve.
