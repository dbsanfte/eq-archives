	DirectX 8.0 installed and bf had me run dxdiag after
installing the game.   *applies a check*

	Been trying to find one.  I don't know the specific details of
my video card other than that it's a S3 Virge and is 4mb, but neither
one of us has been able to load up their website (www.s3.com) and I've
had little luck at Driverfind and Download.com.  Beginning to think
this is an extremely obsolete card.
