One thing that bugs me, on the Sullon Zek server, the only port class
available to the evil team are wizards, there are no evil druids. That
means that the evil team will be denied access to a wizard based nexus
port. I don't know for a fact, but it looks like all the wizard luclin
ports drop you in pvp enabled zones. This is a really big deal on SZ,
where there is no level limit for pvp. It's quite a big advantage if
goods and neutrals can port directly into a pvp safe zone, while evils
are forced to take their chances with a pvp enabled port, or else wait
for the old style way to get to Luclin.

Good and Neutral teams were granted the evil-specific ability to
summon corpses. It only seems fair that evil team should be granted
the same consideration regarding these new luclin ports. Don't force
the evil team to be the only guys waiting around the spires for ports
to the nexus. It's just not fair.
