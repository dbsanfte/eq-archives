My character of choice for horsie will be my troll sk girl, she will
be so obnoxious on a big horse. 

Yeah, they may get a skill for a free one 51 plus if they dump xp into
it but she is only level 35.

Would anyone really pay 8 k for a horse when the next step up is like
15 k? I mean if you can get 8 k you may as well hold out for a better
one. The 100 k one is a waste since its just NEARLY as fast as spirit
of cheetah. That means bard song with any magic drum will be lots
faster. 

So if my druid paid for the 100 k one, she'd probably be a little
faster than level 55 sow but I'll never even see 100 k ;) So I figure
go for the troll.
