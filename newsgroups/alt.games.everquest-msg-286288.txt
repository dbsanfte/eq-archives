Well Lance says "Often, I can win a fight without using much mana at
all, just watch my HP bar take a beating. Or, I may have the ability
to burn mana so heavily that I stay up near full HP but my mana bar
plummets."  Which sounds like (depending on what's he's fighting) he
doesn't have to be full mana / health to fight.  

Of course, if for safety's sake you always want to be full health /
mana before starting a fight, then for sure you want to end each fight
with even bars.
