I'm assuming this is the Monk/BST SMR that drops in Sleepers?  Two of our
monks /randomed to see who was forced to loot it.  A primal
"Book-on-a-Stick" dropped as well, would have complemented his newSMR I
thought but he didn't agree.

Wasn't too amused when an Enchanter turned him into a Gnome and we all
asked for KEI either.
