I forget but i think my mage and a wizzy were in burning woods at that
time..... or a great zone but make sure you have invis and lev is Mons
Letalis... hardly anyone is in there atleast on my server, and head over
across the zone by the ent to the grey and u can take single pulls (most of
the time) of rockhoppers and stonegrabbers... they're a bit tough but i
think you two should have no problem with the pets tanking.
