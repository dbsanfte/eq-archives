It's *typically* safe for good and evil races alike. Beware that there are
occasionally burly kobolds (L8-L12) wandering around the book, who are very
aggressive. And, for what it's worth, my Dark Elf Shadowknight has been
killed by some wandering frog NPC while I was sitting within arms reach
of the book chatting with friends. But for all that I use the book, I've
only seen a frog NPC there that one time. I'd be much more concerned for
those PCs for whom burly kobolds are still dangerous.
