Druid + BST is incredible.  My partner and I duo a lot and we are a 65
druid and 65 BST.  My healing,buffing, nuking (Improved Damage IV and
SF3 - I can crit for about 3500), and root-park crowd control combined
with his DPS and slow, we can tear through almost all non-raid mobs
with little sweat.  It took us a while to figure out exactly how to
work together best, but once we did, it was incredible.
