Take your load of crap comment and stuff it. If you want me to get
specific on the error, then I'm afraid I can't help you. It happened
over two years ago when I was using Netscape 4.7. I'd never used any
versions of IE before 5.0, I was totally in the Netscape camp and had
been using Netscape since version 2.0. But the problem was so annoying
it made my eyes bleed. I have Netscape 6, but rarely use it. IE does
everything I want except for one tiny little feature, and I keep
Netscape 6 on my hard drive to do that. Plus I was trained to support
Internet Explorer, and I did so for over a year and a half. I know it
very well.

I skimmed the download page, yes. No, I've never used Mozilla, but why
should I? IE does everything I want it to do, except for that one
thing. Plus there's the fact that I know it inside and out.

Thousand? Last I heard there were a dozen at most. As for me, you
wouldn't get a dime. I don't give a rat's ass about EQ hacks and
cheats, and so didn't even bother to open Netscape to view the page.
