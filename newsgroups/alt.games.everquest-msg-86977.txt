You have four newbie zones. Try them all. :)

For levels 1-4, FoB is the obvious choice due to the Curscale
armor quests. For levels 5 to 8 or so, I liked Lake of Ill Omen 
the best. There is a ruined building out from the newbie area
which is full of level 4-6 skeletons, and similarly-leveled
roamers of different types in the area. Also, the newbie part 
of LoIO is quite underutilized. 

Warslik's was a death trap for me. The goblins are everywhere; 
it's real easy to get swarmed by them. Swamp of No Hope has 
visibility issues.

Kurn's gets really good around 11 or 12. There are scalebones
in there that are lower, but the greater skeletons (lvl 9-11)
are most common. I *love* Kunark skeletons for soloing: they
have a small aggro radius, don't chain aggro, and don't flee
at low health.

Not only without leaving the continent, but without going more than
three zones (perhaps even two?) from home. The way Kunark is laid 
out from the Iksar point of view, with mob levels getting higher
in every direction, more or less, as you get further from Cabilis,
is wonderful.
