Mistletoe sickle, nothing else is worth getting.

You can get this for around 2 k - 3k, because its
used primarily as a quest part for the POTC earring
quest. Its a FANTASTIC weapon for that, basically 
something that I wish was around before I had my epic.
Its pretty darn fantastic, plus I think it looks cool ;)

Check prices on it in the bazaar, then get lots of spider 
and spiderling silks from vendors or off spiders here
and there. Sell them in the bazaar while you night-night. You'll
be surprised how fast you can earn 2 - 3k. 

You'll likely make far more
money selling such commodities for the time spent getting them, then
you'd ever get porting for donations. A lot of the porting for
donations market is going to dry up some when Planes of power, or the
29 dollar instant teleport travel patch, sells approximately 250,000
copies or more.

Focus effect items are way too pricey, I'd worry about them later. In
the mean time I'd search by slot for HP/MANA items that have AC as
well, and worry more about large amounts of wisdom later. You find
some VERY good items cheap that are kind of odd that way.
