That is a tough call.  Obviously you like this guild for some reason,
correct?  If I were in that situation, I would /gu the positive things i
like about the guild and then say that you won't be participating in an
event that will only cause hurt feelings...Which is what it seems to me you
are saying will happen if you go.  You don't want to waste a lot of time
gaining levels, questing, etc. only to lose it by doing something that is
beyond your abilities.  Hope this helps a little.
