And welcome, to you, too!

Have you perhaps thought, that rather than opening the whole can of worms 
that creating a gateway does, you could redirect the link in the forums to:

http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&group=alt.games.everquest

Where they have already dealt with most of the problems that this situation 
will create?

Personally, there are several reasons I don't like this gateway.  First, and 
this is a petty one, is I'm going to get very tired of seeing 1,000,001 sigs 
that look like:

Could you perhaps create a way for people to have their custom sigs here, or 
-a- custom sig, albeit one without pictures, links to pictures, HTML, 
vbcodes, etc?

Second, you've tried to assemble a list of do's and dont's, and this is good.  
A small criticism though... Please strike the line "DON'T read this forum if 
you dislike spammers/scammers."  Strangely enough, -we- don't like them 
either.  You are very welcome to post here if you don't like them.  In a 
backhanded way, this line almost suggests that we do like them, and if you're 
planning to spam or scam, our humble newsgroup is the ideal place!

Third, seeing broken vbcodes is really gonna get annoying, sigh.  you may 
wish to emphasize, I mean really, REALLY, emphasize, that -anything- vaguely 
clever, like vbcodes or HTML to change fonts and colors is going to make an 
ugly hash in everyone else's newsreader.  I note that your 'Reply to thread' 
page keeps all the clever buttons in for adding these codes.  You may wish to 
find a way to take those buttons out entirely.  Except possibly the quote 
button, since I see you've done something clever with that.

Fourth, I hope your forum and this script is built to withstand people doing 
clever text things, like discussing HTML tags.  Most newsreaders have no 
problem if I enclose the letters "/tr" in angle brackets, for example.  Yours 
may very well get huffy.  It might get even more huffy if I included a 
javascript call to the function log_out() in a post...

Fifth, you may wish to inform your users that USENET is not paginated.  If 
they refer to something happening on say, page 8 of a thread, none of the 
rest of us will have any clue at all what the heck they are talking about.  
Pages?  We don't need no steenking pages!

Sixth, the quote thing.  The way your users view posts arranges them all 
sequentially, viewing 20-odd posts at once.  Their sequence is nothing like 
our sequence for post-viewing, and they may do well to be informed of this.

Seventh, on the reply to thread page, there's a clever box for changing the 
title of the thread.  USENET does tons of clever newsreader-dependent things 
when you change the title of a thread midstream, and I don't see a 'stay in 
topic' option, and it doesn't appear to load the current thread title as a 
default.  This is going to result in a lot of people changing the titles of 
threads willy nilly, which works just fine in message boards, but will be 
rather messy in USENET.  Can you take that box out, or at least make it take 
more of an act of will to change the title?  Hm, it looks like it doesn't 
make a mess (for me) if the box is left blank, so that's good at least.

Well, anyway, I hope some of this helps.  And I'm done whinging now.
