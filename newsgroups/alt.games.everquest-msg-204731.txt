Heres the point, if the attitude of "go ahead and implement it we can
fix it later" is dominate you end up with some fairly sloppy work. I
think we can say no need to cite examples there we know this is the
case. IF however the attitude is "get it right the first time once its
in its in to stay" then we get better results even though we know it
CAN be fixed later after someone has their ass chewed. EQ development
peeps have an extreme case of the former. Even down to things that do
not imbalence the game such as melee class balencing. As for manna
stones how can you cite that when kei and mod rods are in the game???
