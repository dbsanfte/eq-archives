If you can't pass PoJ trials, just what are you going to do in CoD, BoT,
Torment, Tactics?

Oh I know, you can train the living fuck out of people, lag the zone out
with corpses, and generally interfere with other groups there.

I was playing my mage just last week, he's been pretty neglected and has no
flags.  At level 55 I took him to PoN.

The ooc, the players around me..  it bought back horrifying memories of KC,
DL, Omen.

The fuckwits who have to spam bs, the people who don't just wipe their
group, they take YOU out too, KS attempts, I even had my pull charmed by
some asshole druid - i guess punishment for daring to beat him to a mob, in
an area I'd been at for many hours....

That was just 1 day in PoN.  I can count on <no> fingers just how many times
I've been KS'd/trained in HoH, CoD, Tactics and beyond.

That, for me, was the best part of PoP flaggings.

And if that makes me an elitist (commonly used term for anybody disagreeing
with these changes.. chuckle) then so be it.  I don't think its too much to
ask to not have to deal with the fuckwits who slum it in tier 1 zones, the
people who have no manners or respect for anybody else.  No courtesy, no
nothing.

I don't interfere or disrupt other groups exping/gaming experience - I
really don't think its asking too much, to expect the same back.  And flag
restricted zones (for the most part) gave me just that.

Oh well, have fun dieing repeatedly to the "too tough" mobs in these new
zones.  Maybe if you whine loud enough, Sony will give all the gimps in EQ a
5000HP and mana boost too.

Wouldn't want the fucking children to have a challenge now, would we!
