Soloing with heavy dots usually means you are either rooting or using the
dog to fix the victim in place, which gives lots of time to meditate back
up the mana...having the mana reduction on heals, regen, haste, hp buffs,
etc,etc is just too valuable. Course, when I solo now, I use the epic DoT
primarily, being mana free...all the more reason to not be conjuration.
