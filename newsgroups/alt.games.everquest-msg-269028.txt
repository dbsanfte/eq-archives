Heh.  I was about to ding the mid-level necessary to scribe
my next instant heal (18.6, IIRC.)   I'd seen *one* on the
broker while I'd been looking.  So naturally I went out
and bought the Adept version so I could scribe it right
after I gained the spell -- upgrading heals to Adept is a
"good thing" for priests.

So I'm out running around, pulled a double-up green stag
in Archer's Woods, killed it to ding and get the ability, and
it dropped a chest -- with that very same Adept....  (As in
"ding, you have gained a new ability, and BTW here's the
Adept version...")

Naturally I put the one I bought back on the market.
Of course, I also saw 5 other copies -- all selling for
about half what I'd paid the night before...
