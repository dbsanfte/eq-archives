Uh,  firstly automated test suites aren't for testing trivial bugs.
they are for testing complicated boundary conditions that can't be
reached in normal test conditions.

Second, the original dev team didn't do much of anything right, so an
automated test suite is right out.

Hacking an automated test suite together for someone elses spagetti
code that mostly works is quite frankly a waste of time, and I'd
rather they be working on new content, thank you very much
