All my links are long since gone from the time I left the game last 
year, and I know EQ has been through a lot of changes. Heard lots of 
rumors, but haven't dug up many specifics. If you feel like helping out 
with any of the following information, much appreciated.

All this pertains to a 61 (few blue short of 62) agnostic wizard.
Gear is primarily Velius/Luclin (non-Emp) stuff, with a few pieces from 
PoP raids in Tier one and Two zones. (No gods.)

I don't have LDoN yet, and don't plan to for a little while yet, so 
that's out for the time being.

1. I had gotten PoP flagged for PoS/PoV, BoT. Already traded them in for 
a couple AA. I hear other PoP zones are now open without flagging. What 
ones can I just go into. In particular, I'd like to find a place my 61 
Necro partner and I can go to duo for ethereal parchment drops. Any 
suggestions? Crypt of Decay ok for that?

2. I understand the old planes and some other zones got major revamps. 
Any good hotspots for solo/duo or single group activity that didn't used 
to be viable at these levels?

3. I'm not fat with cash, but I have some saved up and can raise some 
more if needed. Any really good deals in the bazaar these days to look 
out for on a budget? (Hoping some prices may have fallen from 
mudflation, etc. For example, I never did get a Spider Fur Cap back in 
the day and they always cost too much.)
Magelo link follows. Prepare to laugh:

4. Any changes to the AA system in the last nine months or so? I 
currently only have about 12 AA and am trying to finish up Spell Casting 
Mastery as I ding AA points, but I've totally forgotten what class level 
AA skills I had been planning to get.

5. What the heck happened to Graffe's??!!??  I hardly recognize the site 
anymore and can't hardly find anything but the spell lists there! In 
short, any really good web links to wizard-useful resources would be 
greatly appreciated.

Thanks.
