They don't really.  They have some class defining abilities.  Some pets 
backstab, but they're not rogues.

You need to read the more than excellent post on this over at the 
Magician's Tower, here -> http://eq1.eqsummoners.com/viewtopic.php?t=26262

But this answers your query,

4. Pets ignore both the class and the race tags.
Pet gear simply says none/none (or other things, depending on the piece) 
because they don't want PCs using powerful gear intended for pets only. 
The item can say it is only useable by barbarian wizards for all the pet 
cares and it will still equip it.
