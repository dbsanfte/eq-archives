I don't think its really possible to make a formula for this; since mana is
Pulse based, the question is how many runs of mana you can do with Amp up.
And since Cantata is a regular song length, how many pulses of mana you can
squeeze in and not have Cantata not up on a tic.  You'd want to keep Cantata
up full time (well it can drop between one tic and the next as long as the
restart is complete before the tic hits), you'd want to keep Amp up so that
its on whenever you finish a mana pulse.  The cycle I wrote above is an
oversimplification, really, since it doesnt' take into account variables in
your connection speed, any lag issues, your physical ability to respond
instantly when any given song is finished casting (wetware lag)... if you have
nice low numbers in all of the above, you might be able to squeeze out even
more mana pulses.  If your numbers are high, I frankly suspect that dropping
amp and just doing cantata mana mana cantata might be the best course of
action, and the only reason for that second pulse of mana (as opposed to just
leaving mana run a bit) would be to maintain timing for when to start your
next cantata.

Are you suggesting that rather than twisting cantata in at all, that amp mana
mana mana mana mana amp is the best mana output that anyone can manage?  That
seems patently false.  For one thing, I'm pretty sure I can squeeze 8 or 9
pulses of mana out of a single amp, so you'd be throwing away 3 perfectly good
pulses to start that next amp up so soon (unless lag et al makes it impossible
to squeeze so many in).  Further, since you aren't running Cantata at all, you
are throwing away 2 pulses of Cantata each time that would come up in my
cycle, and you substitute mana instead, even assuming one pulse of mana is
exactly as good as one pulse of Cantata... which any necro or shaman in your
group would be quick to disagree with if they were conversant with the effects
of bard songs (so few really are).  What I mean here is that not only are you
using mana instead of cantata on that pulse, but even if you are singing one
mana pulse per tic, next tic you are getting just mana pulse when you could
have gotten mana pulse plus cantata, and thats true of the next tic as well.

I did see someone suggest that manasong doesn't really operate on the pulse,
like Bellows patently does; that singing it more often than once per tic on
average (say 4 times every 3 tics) doesn't give any more mana than just
leaving it running.  I don't think thats true but since I don't dual box I
can't say I have evidence.  Perhaps, though, thats what you are referring to.
