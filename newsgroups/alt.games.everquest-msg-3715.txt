That may indeed be her problem, but it's also quite possible that
it *IS* her video card.  When I first got EQ, my old video card
managed to make it PITCH BLOODY BLACK in Cabilis at night, and
also underwater anywhere, any time.  I'm not talking dark and murky,
I'm talking black like intermission on a DVD movie.

Some (older) video cards just flake out when they're asked to do certain
visual effects.
