Because they haven't deleted the characters from those accounts.  *They*
still plan on some of those people coming back, unlike the cemetery.

And you know what else you'll find?  That there's a *helluva* lot less
people at those low levels than there used to be when we were low level the
first time around, far too many to be explained by simply spreading out the
population.  Since they haven't declared the game going bankrupt due
to losing 3/4 of its subscriptions, the extrapolation is pretty easy to
make.
