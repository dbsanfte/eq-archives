Send me a tell next time you're on and I'll sidekick you. I'd love to have a
tank to pal around with, they are soooo rare and so valuable and it would be
nice to hook up with you in game at last!

Yeah,  I made an experimental tank (Fat Elvis) and tooled around with him
for a bit and I was astonished at how well he took damage. In creating him I
focused on the most defensive build I could and right out of the box he was
able to solo yellows and oranges, even one red. Slow to kill them, but a
damned nice meatshield.

Hope to see you sometime in City of Blasters!
