Not to call down DAoC (yet) or anything, but am I the only one smiling 
when the same kind of person who swaggered into a.g.e., ranting about how 
AO would slaughter EQ, is now doing it for DAoC?  What is this obsession 
with predicting a gaming future?  Why do these people frantically align 
themselves with whatever the latest thing is, and then feel the need to 
thrash publically to demonstrate their 'loyalty' (until the NEXT next 
thing comes out, of course...)?
