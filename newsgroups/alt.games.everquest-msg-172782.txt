It's been about the same with my Koada'Dal (erm... highelf) wizard.  The
problem is that before they get root they can't fight worth shit unless they
can get rid of aggro.  In a group he does ok but solo he's lucky if he can
kill blue cons.  I go from my beastlord who can shove yellow and red cons'
heads up their asses to my wizard who cries when a blue con hits him.  Now
don't get me wrong -- I think a wizard could turn out to be really fun to
play as he levels up... but the lower levels suck hard.
