I have a lvl 12 Enchanter on the Quellious server.
I recently bought a Crystal Webshield and put it on my Enchanter, which in
turn means I'd have to get rid of the Runed Totem Staff I was so used to
playing with so I could find a 1 handed weapon.  I did so... sent a billion
auctions/shouts/ooc/tells to every zone and person I could find and
eventually bought a pretty lame Walrus Tooth from a guy lower level than me.

My husband has a 14 Mage who has some sort of quill he bummed off of one of
his friends.. and it pretty much kicks ass, but he has no clue where his
friend got it from.

I'm wondering, in all your experiences, what's the best 1-handed weapon
you've been able to find for casters?  I'm having some troubles, here.

Thanks a bunch.

~Nicole
