Go to a zone like No ro - I do not know if any of the SOL buffs help. Buff
yourself and make a pet - the level 8 and 12 pets from HHK are necessary for
soloing and enchanters are not really in demand until lvl 16 = breeze. Tash
the blue (yellow if twinked) mob and let pet pick up the aggro - after a few
seconds of pet work then start nuking away. Then med for a bit and repeat.
If you can group derv camps that is nice - Bandit camps are even better in
the Karanas but differ from server to server. One of my chanters entered lvl
16 with about 300 pp of "extra" loot - after getting steins, robes etc from
the bandits. Experience fades from these as you close in on 16.  As you move
from lvl 12 upwards try to work close to or in the Oasis zone - get into orc
groups as soon and as often as you can. In Oasis there is significant risk
but nice exp. Also in group work you will be able to use other spells that
will have upgrades that are your future spell line. Croc groups are nice -
My lvl 12 enchanter celebrated that level by soloing a croc - using sow and
possibly (can't remember) making a second pet. If pet dies zone/gate/bash or
if up for it stun/mez and make another pet - recast time is not long.
Partnering with a shammy or light healer is a good way to level up and have
fun. Begging skill appears to be worthless - i do know someone with 100 in
it from pet begging = concentrate on sense heading - so so nice on that
nasty night time low visibility cr. If necessary Fear is a nice spell and
will give time - to let pet work - fear kiting or other activity. Good Luck.
