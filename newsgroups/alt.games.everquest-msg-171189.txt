As I seem to recall.  There were 10 rules set in stone to govern behavior of
it's peoples as a whole.
The 10 commandments.
Look beneath all the varios groups of Laws that govern most nations of
Cristian origian, and you will find those 10 hidden behind them, guiding and
holding them up.
Look at the laws regarding murder..  It is against the law...period.  Look
below the surface.
THOU SHALT NOT KILL.

Laws regarding marrige.

Theft.

All of them.

The 10 commandment should be kept in full view.  They are the basis of our
laws.

Those who take the seperation of church and state to the extreme it is being
held to today are those that hate laws, rules, anything that get's in their
way of their wants.
Religion was the binding that made todays America possible.  The leaders of
the ACLU is run by followers of anti Americans in certain areas.  Remember,
the communist of America cried the day the USSR fell.  They moved into the
enviramental groups.

Take away privately owned land.  Take away what you earn and give to the
non-productive.
If they don't like what you say, it is hate speech.
If you like to travel, your car, or SUV is evil.
You smoke, attack and tax the people that smoke. ( I don't smoke by the
way.)
Remember, tobaco is only a single facet of those companys.  We all pay for
the out of control lawers and judges.

I have said enough here.  I will not speak within this thread again, so
flame away.
