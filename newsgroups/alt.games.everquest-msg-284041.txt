It's hard to create a general rule like this.  Some necro disease DOTs
will debuff melee stats (or something like that) but they can stack as
well, I'm pretty sure.  I think they just made some special rules
because they don't want you to be able to debuff resists too low
(druids), nor double-snare something (necros).
