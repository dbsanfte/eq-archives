*shrug*.. then a raiding guild.. and the gear that comes with it isn't
for you. If you have fun xp'ing tier 3 and below, then by all means
keep at it, you don't need a guild.

Nor much hope of advancement. Its all in what you want.. if you want
to just chat it up online, that is a perfectly valid use of your time
and your choice.

Garbage in, garbage out. If all you do is nothing, you will get
nothing. If you hold yourself to no standards.. your gear won't be up
to standard. We all have a choice in how we play this game and I would
view someone who doesn't put in the effort to work as part of a team
as owning themselves.
