I can't log in t00 Everquest!!!!!!!!!!!!  What is going on?  Its 610am
and all the servres are down.  why can't they tell us thsi stuf in
advancde?


I'm just kidding around.  Well, the servers are really down for the
Gates of Discord upgrade and they estimate nine hours of downtime.

So, is there anyone here that plays on Brell Serilis?  I have a 57
Bard on that server (Aeronica Songweaver).
