I'm lvl 34 now and have gained my last 4 (actually last 7 or so, but I've
been questing in between) levels in and near Splitpaw. Around Paw are some
single spawns but it's usually pretty much camped. Inside is a lot better
because on my server there are almost never more then 2 groups and even more
often just one or even none. The exp is simply great and the loot is
noteable as well (they drop up to 4pp a pop and lots of fs.

I'm now in Crystal caverns but you definately need a group here. With at
least a good tank, healer (cleric pref) and an echanter. The loot is off the
scale, but exp is mediocre (as far as I've seen for the few hours I've been
there). I now almost have a stack of velium bits (stacks go for 100pp or
so), 4 velium weapons (roughly 10pp a piece) and a load of gems like pearls
and jade. I even got a crystalline belt which I heard is worth a few
hundered plat.
Going back in later this evening and try to get a pair of slippers and a new
robe. Maybe even a Herbalists pack, if the rolls go well :)
