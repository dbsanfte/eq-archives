Are you sure it was a rat's "foot" and not a "paw"? If it's a paw, it's
part of this quest:
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=512

Which you can do in S. Qeynos to get a Rat's Paw Necklace. I remember
doing it long ago with another character, so that's why it rang a bell.
If it's actually a "rat's foot" then I don't know. I did a quick check
on quests by item and see no reference to it. If a vendor will give you
a few copper for it, I suggest you take it.
