No, the name is Fooboy. Unless you meant it as an insult. 

I was responing to your spam, begging for guild members.

You were recruiting peeps. I dont think they level. Peeps are mostly
made of marshmellow covered in sugar.

Perhaps you should ask people on Povar? Perhaps the whole usenet
community dosn't need recruiting messages.

Usually guild lead by people who act like you just spend all night
/shouting and /oocing for new members in the bazaar. Maybe you can do
that?

See Peeps! You are throwing marshmellows at Giants in Kael? Does it
work like root? Do they get all sticky?
