My cleric tried out the new task thing and was told to travel to the frozen
island in timorous deep. Is that the iceberg with the golru? It's a
dangerous thing to do without EB and invis and my experience of underwater
fighting is endless mesages of interrupts to spells and the message "you are
out of range" when the critter is in you face as you slug hand to hand on
the ocean floor.

Does anyone know of a site where people are posting spoilers to the tasks? I
just wish the'd done the thing with the compass they use for adventures at
least, or perhaps given me a stack of no rent no drop potions for lev and
such so i could get to the island in the first place.

p.s. graphical corruption problems seem to have been solved by logging in
long enough to turn off all the advanced features. I would have thought a
geforce 4 ti would have been good enough for me to see them. Pity the game
doesn't have a "safe mode" that turns such things off and lets you try
turning them on one by one to see if they crash your pc.
