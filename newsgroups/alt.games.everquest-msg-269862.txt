My best advice is strip them and then DELETE the characters; then
start those characters on the account that you want to play at level 1
so that you can learn the ins and outs of those classes...

As a player, you learn a lot about the play of a class in the first
few levels. Even being an experianced player, and even if you know (or
think you know) the capicity of the classes, it will work better IMHO
simply to have the experiance as a player with the classes.
