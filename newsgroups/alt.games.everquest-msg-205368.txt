In the OOT, there are seafury cyclops that I need to wipe to get the tainted
/ corrupted to spawn for druid epic. I was wondering what happens if I snare
several and lead them into the water, what happens. Do they swim, walk on
water, drown? I'd like to "quad" them, but its a small space to do so. If
the water was an ally, it would help.
