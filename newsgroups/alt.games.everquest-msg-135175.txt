Today I upgrade my two computers with the Det 30.30 drivers.  Now, when I
get to the character selection screen I no longer have key board or mouse
function.  Both systems are running Windows XP, one with a GeForce4 4600 and
the other a GeForce2 Ti 200.  Now I was able to roll back the driver on the
GF4 system which solved the problem.  This didn't work on the GF2 system.
I've tried to install drivers from 23.11 on up to 29.60 without fixing.

Has anyone ever seen a problem like this and if yes, how did you fix it?

Thanks,
Greg
