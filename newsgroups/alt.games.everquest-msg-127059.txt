I've never argued otherwise. What I said is that the word is not immediately 
offensive by itself, the listener must make the decision of being offended 
or not, depending on who speaks the word.

Perhaps. My own view is that liberal use of the word by both blacks and 
whites (only with the consent of the blacks, of course) would eventually rob 
the word of all its power to offend and hurt, like it has happened already 
with "queer", and that can only be a good thing.
