I've had failures even with a skill in the 30s.

2 spiderLING silks make a silk thread.
2 silk threads make a silk bandage OR
3 silk threads make a silk cord.

A good place for spiderling silk around Qeynos is the main run up to
Halas.  Also, check merchants as they may have a few in stock.

Silk cords are used with various pelts to make bags and such.  These
are the weight reducing bags mentioned elsewhere.  So if you're a
monk....

2 spider silks make a silk swatch.

Raw silk armor weighs about the same as cloth but has quite a bit
better AC.  Cured silk is even lighter and has a better AC still.
You'll either need to be a brewer, or know one, to make Cured though.
