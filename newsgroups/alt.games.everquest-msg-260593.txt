If you're meleeing an 'average' blue mob, you should hit somewhere
between 60 and 65% of the time. ... at least that's the way it used to
be, been a while since I did any parsing with my monk. That would
imply that the crit discipline does more damage. At least that's the
theory I'm working under with my warrior. Haven't bothered to parse
him to see if the hit percentages are still bascially the same.
