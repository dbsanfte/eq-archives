Yeah, common occurrence here, too. I'm thinking that the timer message is
not in synch with the actual trigger. In other words, it nominally reads
from the time the first person actually materialized in the instanced zone,
but is perhaps actually running from the time he first entered the zone. So,
if he's a slow zoner the out-of-synch might be noticable. But that's just a
wild-ass guess based on seeing this happen a number of times, unpredictably.
