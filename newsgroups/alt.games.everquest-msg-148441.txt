Please quote enough to allow people to know what "it" is.

And, no, the Staff of the Wheel quest can't be done solo
at 29, if ever.  You won't need much help, though:  you'll
need enduring breath for some of it, either from a friend
that can cast it, potions, or an item with that effect.
The only part you really can't do solo is the part that's
in Lower Guk:  that will require Invisibility to Undead
(another friend, potion, or item at level 29), and the
room where the spawn is in Lower Guk has both live and
undead spawns, so you'd need either a group to kill the
room while you pick it up or another group killing that
room for you.

Most of it can be done solo with potions and invis, though.
