In article <3663vgF4thljkU1@individual.net>, tcells1@yahoo.com says...

My friend? Yes. Absolutely. No question about it. He's definately 
calling the guy a chicken-shit-girl. If he didn't want to include the 
sexist insult he'd have chosen a different word for coward... like 
"coward", "chicken", or "chicken shit"

Beaver as working hard doesn't invoke any sexist stereotypes or 
anatomical references. It literally refers to the industriousness of the 
dam building animal.

Couple that with the fact that the slang form of 'beaver' has largely 
fallen into disuse. google Beaver, the first several page of hits are 
all innocent/animal related... try the same for pussy... 'nuff said.

Never. You claiming you *have*?

Tame as a kitten? That suggests friendly, cuddly... not cowardly.

For something easily intimidated? No, the only animal references I've 
ever heard for cowardice refers to mice. Of "mice and men", "timid as a 
mouse", etc... and chickens, of course.

In actual point of fact, I wasn't claiming we intended to call them 
"vaginas". I was claiming we called them 'weak & frightened women', 
using a term & stereotype women pretty much universally find deragatory 
and offensive. 

I -did- assert that the *reason* pussy is a deragtory term for woman is 
through anamotical etymology, but even if I were to concede on that 
point the sexist stereotype remains.

The word pussy for coward (irrespective of any anatomical reference) 
still invokes the sexist 'frightened little girl' stereotype, and NOT 
the feline animal.

Further, and most importantly:

The fact that pussy is a current and pervasive slang for female 
genitalia (unlike say 'beaver'), *even if not directly germane to the 
etymology of its use as cowardly*, still looms large in the public 
consciousness; it should not be ignored, when enforcing a 'code of 
conduct' policy.
