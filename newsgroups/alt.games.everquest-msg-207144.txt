So how often have you crawled deep into a dungeon like Dragon
Necropolis, Siren's Grotto, Jugs in Sebilis, Howling Stones? How did
you get your corpses out after a wipe? Having a necro or SK summon
them out is hardly all that much more exciting than a GY. 

I'm leaving out the tougher ones like the Hole and Chardok where
faction mules can drag people out.
