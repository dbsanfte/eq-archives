Yeah, I can't wait for all the dungeons which are now "stay where
you are and die because you are NOT going to make it out" to
become nastier versions of KC.  For someone who pulls (like Sang
mentioned with his twink) it makes sense.  For the average shaman
or cleric or (insert non-puller here) I just don't see the benefit.
Well, I guess it'll help when it's common, since you'll have to run
to stay alive at any camp which can be trained by people deeper
in.

As a side note, you can only put 3 points into running and 5 points
into WIS (or other abilities.)   And, yes, 10 WIS is just a piece of
equipment but it would allow me to swap out my Bracers of the
Reverent for BD bracers and not lose any current WIS.  Sounds
good to me. ;)

Doubtful IMO.   It's "Inate Run Speed";  how can you not run indoors
as fast as you can outside naturally?   But I can always hope.
(After a few days of KC, I'm ready for a zone where people don't
have speed enhancements and can't successfully train anytime
something goes bad.)
