I didn't join a guild and start raiding till I was 50. As a Druid most of my
really useful spells are aquired post-level 49.

Now that I've been on a few Raids (Air, Fear, Hate, Growth) and have won a
couple rolls, I'm hooked!

Yes they are mind-boggling in the time required to collect everyone, port
up, set up camp, do rezzes if needed, start the pulls etc. etc. I was on a
Fear raid last week but had to leave after 8 hours, just after we cleared
the West Side - but before we got to the Gorgons (sigh).

Anyway Cel, the EMarr website on ezboards has a section where people
announce pick-up raids. This is a fun way to find a raid that fits your time
and schedule. Maybe you can even arrange to come up in a reinforcement group
and just play the tail end of one.

See you!
