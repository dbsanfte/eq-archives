bizbee is correct.  There is a reason that dick-waving in-yer-face
taunters like this chump you ran into often disappear never to be seen
again:  they can't stop themselves from being assholes.  Remember that
the GMs are gamers too.  Play a GM for a fool once or twice, build up
a history of being petitioned/reported, and you too can get your stupid
ass stuffed and mounted on the wall in the GM's den [... I heard this
one over here with the lute was auctioned for $150 only three weeks
before I bagged him ...].  You have to /report and petition the jerks
tho, they won't ever get known if their victims don't bother to turn
them in.
