Well, against higher level mobs I'm getting resists... so its adding hate,
sucking mana, and doing nothing.  And against lower level mobs
they tend to die so quick its not worth it.  But mobs that are going to
be there swinging for a while, yet not hard for me to stick to, it seems
to be a nice way to help whittle em down.  Haven't noticed anyone
else casting it so far, is it commonly used?

That was my question, how much hate does it make?  If its just a little,
then its pretty useful... and my experimenting with it today tends to
bear that out, didn't get me aggro any more than sitting down might have.
