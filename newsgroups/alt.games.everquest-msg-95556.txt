Hello,

I have a lvl 10 Dark Elf Cleirc. I was in Befallen from 8 to 9 and then I
left. But now I am going back there to hunt. I seen a mob there "Skeleton
Lrodd" and I was just wondering what lvl he is and how hard he is to kill.
He never aggo's me untill I attack his skellie buddies. But that is when I
make my exit. He was red to me at 8 and 9. But I was reading that he is
around 13. So at lvl 10 could I root and nuke him? Thanks,

-Dylan-
