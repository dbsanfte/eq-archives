The good news is that the Lambent armor quests are fast
and dead easy if you're doing them at high level (unlike
some other mid-level class armor quests, which can still
be tedious at any level because of rare spawn
or faction requirements).

I did them all in just a couple of days at level 52,
solo, because I was twinking my bard via my Paladin.

Check out www.eqdiva.com for good Lambent quest overviews.
