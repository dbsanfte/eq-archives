New content can exist in old world zones. EQ needs to think outside 
their little boxes. AC had invasions, cities were destroyed, and so on.

Consider what LoY did to Grobb. They just didn't go far enough. Grobb 
should have been levelled and rebuilt and populated with frogloks. The 
trolls could have retreated to Neriak...and everyone gets those for 
free... but there could be several zones under Grobb, off the back of 
grob, tunnels connecting grob to Guk, perhaps an ancient Troll Tomb 
located in the mazes beneath Grobb that is cracked and unleashes a horde 
of 'new content'... that would all be new and only available if you buy 
the expansion...except for a few tie-in mobs added to old world zones, 
and perhaps new Mobs added to the Swamp...

Existing quests involving the swamp are revamped to run off nektulous 
mobs, or inny mobs as appropriate. Quests that no longer make sense are 
withdrawn... odds are the item is garbage anyways. If its a part of the 
  some other longer quest provide an alternate.

Players are starting to demand more than getting shunted into the next 
little box with each expansion. :) New boxes will start having little 
positive effect on the bottom line... witness the fate of OOW.

Moreover, revamping the old world to make it relevant *is* compatible 
with expansions. Quests can move through the old world along with the 
new, mobs can be added to the old world, tradeskill drops for new items 
can be added to the old world. (with just a few components coming 
exclusively from new zones)

The just have to *think* a little

To further clarify the revamps could be tie-ins with the expansion so 
that *having* the expansion makes the revamp drops particularly worthwhile.
