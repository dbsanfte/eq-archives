That meana a lot more faction work, and I better deciode it I want to
be KoS in Rivervale or not. I did figure out the Halfings are on the
same faction as Rivervale, so at least I wont be KoS there, for the
most part.

I am going to try Qeynos, and see how it is there and maybe get some
Halas work. I heard theres some deep pockets there.
