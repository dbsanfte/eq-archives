 In another 6 levels you will get FD. When you do make a macro like this
one: /attack off, /doability # (wherever you have feign death),/sit off ,
/attack on.
 Once you get your feign up to usefull levels, hitting the button will make
you turn off feign, feign sit up and start attacking again. On a succesful
feign (up until level 35), you'll drop down the aggro list and you will only
be pausing your attack briefly.
Hope this helps you eventually.
