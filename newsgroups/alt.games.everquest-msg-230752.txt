As Lief pointed out, a 61 Ranger stealing aggro from the MT is simply
not playing well, hell he's not even exhibiting basic competence.  Of
all the melee classes Rangers have the absolute best aggro control
tools, they can take aggro or shed it pretty much as they please so
long as they aren't stupid about it.  Rangers (starting at level 52?)
were well able to avoid stealing aggro from Warriors _before_ the
recent addition to Warrior spell casting abilities (looks like magic,
smells like magic, tastes like magic...  Warriors!  Now Improved With
25% More Hybridization Than Ever Before!).  Your story reminds me of
the "twink du jour" Paladins out there who play so badly that once in
a while I get huge compliments after pretty ordinary play sessions.
Were I you, I'd just add him to my "do NOT group with this genius"
list and move on.
