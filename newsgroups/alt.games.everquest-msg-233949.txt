Hi All;

I'm fairly new to fighting in BoT.  I have gotten those four gems and
finally got the ring to combine them.  Does this ring or key work like the
key for Old Seblis and the door in The City of Mist, where once you use the
key it goes on your keyring or do I have to carry this ring all the time to
gain entry into the Tower.  If I only have to use it once to activated it,
is that something I can do by myself, such as, use it, stick my head in and
leave or is that something suicidal?  Where do I go to use this ring/key?

Thanks All for your time.
