Our server also seems to have much less people then before.  Has been =
like this for over a month now.

  "Someone, Somewhere" <uo_dude@hotmail.com> wrote in message =
news:lLzK8.10458$b73.10357@nwrddc01.gnilink.net...
  Was wondering who plays there and when do you play.....the reason I =
ask is that it seems to me that this server has been unplayed as much as =
before, or maybe everyone is in Luclin.

  Anyhow, I was also wondering if anyone on this server had a cheap(like =
less than 50pp) magic blunt weapon for a shaman barbarian?

  Thanks, and thank you ahead for responding...
