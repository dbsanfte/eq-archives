My question would be, why?

F9 just changes your view, I can think of only 2 ways this could be of use
and one doesn't work
1. That select view will give you a greater view of your characters
surroundings, rather just the First Person.
2. You can see your character so tell if hide has worked
The last one won't have the desired effect, hide always appears to have
worked for your view even if it hasn't.
