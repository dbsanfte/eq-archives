I happen to aprove of the group buf change, but it makes me wonder why
people like you want to insinuate that everyone who disagrees with them is a
litle kid. I bet youre too gutless to say that to someones
face.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Couldn't agree more.  The original post and the one that followed were anything
but whines.  They just laid out their take on the problem and gave a good
example of why they prefer to solo and why they would want KEI available to
them.  You have to be a dumb ass to insinuate that that is whining.
