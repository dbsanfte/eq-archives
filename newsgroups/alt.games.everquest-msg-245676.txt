If you upgraded your mobo,Try checkiing the device manager to see if there are any resident parts from the original mobo, if so they are probably causing a conflict. (the game is looking for parts of your system that are no longer there) Once you remove the un needed hardware from device manager, things should be back to normal. you may even have to reinstall DX9b and some drivers, especially if you have onboard sound. ( that always causes some probs ) :-)
