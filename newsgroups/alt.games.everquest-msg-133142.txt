I assume you mean for monks, or perhaps for warriors in very specific
end game encounters. Otherwise, until you get up to some acceptable
level of equipment (depending on level of character) AC is > All for
warriors. 

+HP items are nice, but hard hitting mobs will eat up those extra HP
very fast. And even faster if your AC is questionable.

So for the OP, our young forties warrior friend, go for the AC until you
have a massive amount, then worry about +HP items if you have the luxury
of some extra slots for it.
