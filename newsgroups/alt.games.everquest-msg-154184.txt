Oh, is THAT what happened?!?

Over a year ago now, my (smallish) guild was hanging out
near the centaur town, helping out some of our mid-level
members.  It was more a picnic than a PL event.

There was another group over a hundred yards or so,
pulling Centaurs.

Things went fine for a couple of hours, when suddenly we
noticed the other group getting slaughtered by a large
gang of Centaurs.  "Wow, bad pull", we thought.  They were
too far away for us to help in any way before it was all
over.

Then, for no reason we could figure out, the killer Centaurs
and, it seemed, every Centaur in the village descended upon us
en masse in a psychotic frenzy of bloodlust, like pony-shaped
piranhas.

Most of us were wiped out, and only two people escaped to
the NK zone.
