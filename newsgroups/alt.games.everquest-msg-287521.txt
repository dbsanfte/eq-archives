Flagged Zones and Locked Content - changing

http://forums.station.sony.com/eq/posts/list.m?topic_id=130431

Quoting,

As I'm sure most of you are aware, backflagging has been a hot topic for 
EQ for quite a while now.  The complex flagging mechanisms for older 
expansions can make it difficult for guilds that take on new people to 
experience the content they are wanting to do.  With the sheer amount of 
content between Qeynos and Crystallos it can be extremely difficult for 
new players to catch up with their friends in any reasonable time frame.

So, in order to make it easier for players to access appropriate content 
we would like to make some changes to previous flags.  All of the 
existing flags will stay in place, as will the various quest rewards 
that were additional benefits to their completion.  However, the 
following zones will have an alternate entry criteria of a minimum 
level.  It's important to know that either the previous key OR the new 
minimum level is required to enter the zone, not both.

Required Level 46

    1. The Howling Stones
    2. Old Sebilis
    3. Cobalt Scar

Required Level 55

    1. Veeshan's Peak
    2. Vex Thal
    3. Sleeper's Tomb
    4. Locked areas of the Temple of Ssraeshza

    2. Halls of Honor
    3. The Temple of Marr
    4. Tower of Solusek Ro
    5. Drunder, The Fortress of Zek
    6. Yxxta
    7. Kod`taz

Required Level 60

    1. Plane of Water
    2. Plane of Air
    3. Plane of Fire
    4. Plane of Earth
    5. Uqua
    6. Ikkinz

Required Level 62

    1. Plane of Time
    2. Qvic
    3. Inktu`Ta

Required Level 65

    1. Txevu
    2. Tacvi

End quote.
