     Sony will start selling add-ons such as weapons for an adventure
     character or a souped-up car for a racing game next year, said
     Andrew House, executive vice president of Sony Computer
     Entertainment America.
     Some of the add-ons will be items normally earned by long hours of
     play; novice players could pay to equip themselves with the same
     gear as more experienced competitors.
     The inspiration for the Sony initiative, said House, came from
     participants in online subscription games who sell virtual goodies
     they've earned in the game on EBay Inc.'s auction site, sometimes
     for thousands of dollars.
