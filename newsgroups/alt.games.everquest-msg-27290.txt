This isn't a dictionary definition we're dealing with here, but a role

Healers keep their group alive and ready for the next pull
Tanks keep aggro
Crowd Control neutralizes adds
Damage Output takes mob's hp
Buffer boosts stats
De-Buffer hurts mob's stats
Snarer keeps a runner from going for help.

Obviously some classes wear several hats,
and multiple chararcters may wear the same
hat.

In the role of healer, preventing damage
is just as good as healing it afterwards, better
if it costs less mana.

Look at some of the spell lines a cleric gets
Heals - repair damage
Stuns - prevent damage
AC Buffs - prevent/mitigate damage
HP Buffs - provides a safety margin for healing.

Only one line actually fixes damage, the others
are aimed a preventing/mitigating damage.
