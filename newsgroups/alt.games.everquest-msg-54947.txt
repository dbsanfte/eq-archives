Went to EK today, event does end apparantly, but restarts after
three hours.  Now people were being more decent, again not
hearing anyone talk about KS at all, lot of items being called out.

Best part is, there are actually people killing there for exp; no
way on the planet I could find an exp group for the RM mobs,
but low 30's killing squads are really functional in EK... course
I could solo blues there too, and soon was calling out my own
drops.

Monk gear, SK gear, bard gear, int caster gear... all decent looking
stuff, not uber, mind you, but different and having its place I think.

I looted off people calling out locations a nice head piece
and a nice belt, forget the stats, both any priest class usable
with wis mana and resists.

All in all, I think I'm up about 20 wis from the two events, and
have a straw spun belt and forest loop to sell.

Going to go poke my head in to QH next, see whats up there.
