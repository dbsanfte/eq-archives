    No kidding. People want to be rewarded for running halfway across the
world, but now know it just won't happen. So they don't bother doing quests
for XP.

    I don't know if the mail quests give less XP than killing beetles, but I
don't think the lowest-level quests are the problem. I think the problem
arises when they have quests that give "significant" xp to anyone who is of
sufficient level to port themselves, or quests where the quest components
are stackable non-Lore non-No Drop items. The quest designers seem incapable
of determining how quickly a porter can complete a given quest, and change
the XP such that rate of XP gain doing quest equals rate of XP gain hunting.
Or, they CAN do this and use really cruddy standards for hunting that don't
match what a player can do.

    As for handling those stackables quests (like bone chips, say), if they
want to modulate XP then instead of reducing XP per turn-in and hitting
those who do the quests "honestly", have the quest giver hand out a Lore
token that has to be delivered to another NPC a reasonable distance away for
the XP and items. The factions and coin come from the main turn-in. Then, a
faction farmer can plow through a quest and not worry about getting bogged
down with items, and by controlling the distance between the NPCs (always
assume Gate capability of the PC) one could control the XP gain rate for the
quest as a whole.
