That's been the big question on my mind.  I'm running 512megs ram and
a 32 meg vid card, but I still see my processor and HD grinding away
(10k rpm drive) on a 400Mhz Intel (running clipping at medium setting,
and graphics at low to med.). Yes, it's time to upgrade, but would a
dual processor show an improvement, assuming other possible bottle
necks were elminated?

Has anyone had any experience with such an upgrade? If so, it'd be
great to hear about any marked improvements or failures.  I am amazed
that Sony hasn't done some kind of marketing deal with a big
manufacturer (Dell, Gateway, etc...) for the ultimate EQ box.  I mean,
imagine a certified solution like that? I bet people would pay...
