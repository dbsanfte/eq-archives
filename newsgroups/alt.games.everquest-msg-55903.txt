Just wanted to add my recent experiences.

I used to have SBlive 1024 in a win98 configuration, but upgraded the cars
to a Turtle Beach Santa Cruz when they were released.  I had issues with
SBlive stuttering under win2k with EQ and the so during my recent upgrade to
XP hoped that that would not still be a problem for the TB card.  However,
much to my dismay I got stuttering in EQ and stuck midi, even with the
drivers TB released themselves which claimed to work under XP.  I have to
agree that it is under EQ and no other game that these problems seems to
occur for me too.  Well yesterday I bought a SB Audigy after being assured
they would work ok under XP and EQ, and lo and behold after installing the
drivers and then the update from the creative site, no more stuttering under
EQ.  So for all those interested, SB Audigy seems to work gr8 under XP
though im not sure about win2k =)
