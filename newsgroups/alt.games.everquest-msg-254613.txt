Heck Im going the other way on this one.   

They reacted that fast!  Darn fine work.  

Better then just letting us live with the problems for 1 month.

As to how they can miss things, pretty easy.  Very often addition A,
breaks unrelated item B.

I know I go on to test and do check things out, but most people that
complain don't even know how to logon to test.
