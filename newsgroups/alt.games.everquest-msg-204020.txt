Wow I didn't expect that kind of responce.

First off my comment was at least partly tounge in cheek, but even ignoring 
that (which I thought was obvious) how much different / worse would this 
really be than the current situation ?

I can understand your fears about spam, but if the implemented a standalone 
tool like EQIM then this would not be a real issue.

Asside form that I really don't see what there is to get freaked out about.

I see no similarity between having a "not immersive" method of trading and 
and EBay sales. (You still need the plat in game so what is the difference 
between browsing a web site and looking at the floor in the Bazzar ?)

What exactly are the negitive effects of the bazzar (IYO) ?
Other than being a bit harsh on dial-up players and the like I can't think 
of one, and remember that the dial-up players still have it better than 
they did before.

I will say again I am NOT seriously suggesting these changes, but I don't 
see what the problem with them would be, Ok it would be less "immersive", 
but how "immersed" do you really feal in the bazzar ?

Jim
