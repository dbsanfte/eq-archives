So you'd have no complaints if your character's xp and skills decayed
over time ?

You log on after a week and find out your sword skill has decayed to
the point where you can't use the sword you'd just bought, and you've
dropped 2 levels.

You wouldn't be saying "Guess what - some things decay over time" then
- you'd be pissed.  Same for guild XP - your guild has a bust few days
tradeskilling and getting completing groups quests, and you lose a
guild level as a consequence ?

It was a stupid decision to begin with, and I'm glad it's been fixed.
