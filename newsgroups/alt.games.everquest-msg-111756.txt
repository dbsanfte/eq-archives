I know.

Yes, I do know what Ancient implies ;)

>> Protection of the Glades: 24 ac, 470 hps, 6mana/tick
>> Bulwark of faith, 38 AC

Again, I know. I was doing the math on the notion that PotG+BoF+Marzin
gave total stats that were better than Blessing of Aegolism.

You know that if it was *simple*, the combo would be used instead of
Aego for everyone instead of just for especially interested people :)

Which of the three conflict with the cleric and mage self only buffs?

Hm, PotG isn't counted as an AC buff for his AoE?

A good reason to want single target PotG right there :p
