Having been part of a.g.e. for as long as I have, and considering the fact 
that it's nearly ground to a halt as of late, I feel comfortable enough 
saying that Vanguard is definitely worth a try. Some may well feel that it 
incorporates  just enough of the WoW design philosophy with regard to 
questing to be successful without leaning too far toward shooting for mass 
market appeal.

Diplomacy is pretty cool. I hope they put it to good use as the game 
progresses.

I'm posting while at work, so no time for a more in-depth review - perhaps 
later - but I wanted to mention it, anyway.

Pre-order access began on Friday, Jan. 26. Full launch is Tuesday, Jan. 30. 
Hope to see some of you there!
