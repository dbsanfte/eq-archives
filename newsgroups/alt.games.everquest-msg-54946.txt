Not really, but hey, whatever floats your boat.

No. I won't. I can't allow or disallow your ability to inspect me. I have
no choice. The choice I do have? If you inspect without asking, well,
don't ask me for shit in game. And do I give a rats ass what you think
about me for taking this stance?

Nope.
