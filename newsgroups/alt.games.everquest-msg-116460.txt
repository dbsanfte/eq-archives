My Wood Elf bard still looks like she is strumming a lute, but the new
drum graphic is there in all it's glory.

Also, a bit OT though, when my bard strums her new lute, she strums
the back of it, with the strings facing her body.

/bug maybe? Or time for a video upgrade? (Matrox G400 Dual Head 32MB
