I seriously doubt that would be the case.  Each warrior would have had to
successfully TAUNT the mob during the fight in such a way as to distribute
the damage evenly.  That would be so hard to accomplish that lets agree it
is an impossibility.

If you did this in an area where single pulls would be easy and there was no
worry about adds walking by I bet that after a few mobs several of your
warriors would be around 50% health.  If SOE ever gave Rogues and Warriors
the ability to bind wounds to 100% then your idea of having a six warrior
gang rape of a mob would hold some real possibility.
