The space is negligible.  It's much cheaper for them to just sit on
the inactive data than to risk the potential CS headaches from the
accidental deletion of active accounts, or the expense of grafting
a fail-safe account deletion mechanism onto their existing system.
(Just ask Prexus players about the robustness of their existing
data retention capabilities.)  And this way, when people do return
after an extended absence they're usually delighted to find their
characters still there, giving SOE a free CS win.
