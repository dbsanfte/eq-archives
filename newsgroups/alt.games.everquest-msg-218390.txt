I might need to try one of these.  Saw some of the dropped loot from 
there last night, it's nice :)

This definitely needed doing.  Having opened a lot of these, we only ever 
found a single diamond.  Most the time we didn't find enough cash to 
cover the cost of the spell reagent that would be required to open the 
item.

I guess that's what happened last night when a mob bolted at half health 
and I couldn't find any message relating to fear.

Bummer.  I don't know anybody who would mess with the ones that weren't 
100% in the first place, now they won't mess with any of 'em :/

Woot, more use for Exile Summoned :P

I've heard these type 7 slots will be able to accomodate all but type 8 
augments.  Can anybody confirm this one way or another?

Had no idea a rule like this existed.  Maybe explains why we couldn't 
inspect a chest once.

This is kinda lame.  If they're going to remove slots from all the ST 
weapons why not remove the slots from things like Blade of War?

I wants it...

This should be kinda neat.

Guess making the staff of forbidden rites cost a ton of plat wasn't 
enough deterrant?

Hope this works with animations...

This is good.  Hated having stuff poof because I needed to go 10' to a 
merchant and come right back.

YES.

25% WR, 10 giant slot packs, cost 200ishpp to make (if you forage/loot 
the fur yourself) and trivial around 150 (EQTC lists the trivial as 
exactly 150, not sure if it's confirmed).  Somehow I don't see these 
selling to well, but I'll be making a bunch for myself :D

> - Jewelcraft Mastery works properly now.

Wish they'd define "properly" :P  Under the original system, if you were 
at 50% or higher success on an item, JCM3 would push you to 100% success.  
They changed it a while back so that if you were failing 50% of combines 
it would reduce that failure by 50% to 25%.

Overall, lots of good stuff in this patch, but I really wish they had 
left PoM alone.  Even if it was impossible to find a rez in there.  The 
changing of the flavor NPCs can add a bit more optional risk to dungeons 
for those that get bored (had a tank who wanted to pull the assassination 
target in a dungeon along with the 5 other mobs in that room all at once 
because we hadn't had a near wipe on that adventure yet).
