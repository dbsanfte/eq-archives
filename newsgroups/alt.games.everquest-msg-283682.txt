See, this is the sort of mystery that I'm wondering about.  If they 
include the updated NRo/SRo, then how about all the zones which were 
added not as part of an expansion?

Paineel, Warrens, The Hole, Stonebrunt, Jaggedpine... none of those were 
in the original game, but none are part of an expansion either.

And do you get Kithicor as it originally was, or as it is now? 
Splitpaw?  Befallen?  Mistmore?

If the intent is, as you say, to merely unlock expansions, but otherwise 
use the game as it is today, then all of the above should be in, and in 
their current state.

I'll grant you, Nedaria's Landing does seem a part of an expansion, even 
though it came in before the expansion was actually released... it was 
kind of a "teaser" showing the graphics and so on, and for most people, 
wasn't interesting for much, although I've heard the Forgotten Halls is 
really a good lowbie PL zone.
