You leveled.  Somewhere around 24 all blues start /coning the same.  You
have two different /con messages for greens, though.  One for the top
three green levels, and one for below that.  Around 35, only the top
level of greens will have the top message, and all the others will have
the other.  Past around 40, there is only one message per color.
