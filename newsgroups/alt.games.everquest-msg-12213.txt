You can make yourself non-kos with the Necro guild under Qeynos reasonably
easily, as long as you don't mind being extremely kos in the regular city.
Bind yourself in a safe spot well away from the city gates and well away
from the secret entrance to the Qeynos sewers as well. I got killed twice
because some idiot trained the guards to the secret entrance.

Next cast Gather Shadows (obviously) and run to the temple of life. Jump in
the pool (still invis) and pick out a Koalindl  fish. Once the fish is
targeted swim to North West corner of the pool and wait for it to get within
view. Once it is use a lifetap to kill it. If the fish is far enough away
from the guard Enik Runkle, he won't aggro on you. If he does then climb out
of the water, he normally won't follow. If you get out okay then either
Feign Death or camp out to clear the agro list and Enik will return to his
guarding spot. Once he does, cast invis and go after another fish. I did
this with my Iksar Necro about 15 times and am amiable with the Necro guild
beneath the city.

Also you can kill Kobolds in the Warrens off of the Paineel newbie area for
faction with both Paineel and Erudin. I took my human SK of Innoruuk there
for about 5 levels. He can shop and bank in Paineel and walk through Erudin
and catch the boat with no problem. What's odd is that my Iksar Necro conned
friendlier to the Paineelians than my human SK did at the start.
