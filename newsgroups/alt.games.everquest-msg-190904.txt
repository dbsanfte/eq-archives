Most difficult (and expensive) and therefore profitable and in demand at 
the highest levels: Tailoring and Blacksmithing.  The cultural stuff is 
usually pretty nice, but there's a lot of PoP stuff around that doesn't 
require a specific race to make.  Pottery is also profitable at the higher 
end from what I hear, but also insanely hard/expensive now.

Brewing is easy, bakers are a dime a dozen, jewelcrafters are a nickle a 
dozen, fletching is best left to rangers (about a quarter a dozen).

That leaves make poison, which is something rogues do and I don't think is 
exactly marketable, alchemy which is insanely expensive but you can make a 
little bit of money at in the higher end, and tinkering which gnomes do and 
are about as rare as fletchers.
