It's because Runnyeye is inhabited by Goblins.  EQ's various Goblin
lairs have a few very consistent qualities to them:
(1) If you are of a level to get good xp there you're going to have
one helluva a time surviving, even in a full group.
(2) If you're tough enough to survive while still gaining some xp
and maybe being interested in one or two items that might drop there
you will spend almost all your time fighting hordes of green and lt.
blue cons for little or no xp and total crap loot.
(3) If you're tough enough to crush the little buggers beneath your
steel-shod heels you'd better get there the first week or two the
dungeon is open, because after that whatever useful loot it has will
have totally flooded the market and not be worth the time it takes
to pharm it.
The above is only a slight over-generalization.
