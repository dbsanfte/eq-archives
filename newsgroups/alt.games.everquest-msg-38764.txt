It's actually items that return first taking open inventory slots before
going into containers so the Bag will drop, but like the man said, don't
trade like this, many people do "Selling 3 bags of stuff at first torch" is
a common /auc in EC but so is the /shout "Whoever picked that bag up at
first torch please give it back"

The Wurmy, I think, was reduced to Large as it was a favourite scam to ask
to see the weapon then hope that it would then drop (they don't return to
the wielders hand when trade is cancelled)

On the subject of the account banning, warning, by all means petition but I
don't know how much time they will spend on it and I know they won't return
the items lost.
Basically don't trust anyone, some are trust worthy but there are also those
that are far to trusting. I've been asked to hold onto equipment to swap to
another character. I can understand that when playing my primary as I never
use RP or Anon and so my guild tag, level etc are shown but I have people
ask this of sub 20th level characters who are not twinked and not in the
guild, mad, I have always passed on equipment, money etc and sometimes have
been rewarded nicely for it but I'd never trust another to do it myself.
