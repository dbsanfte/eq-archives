My SK started out with mostly Ry gorr. I got it with my necro. Also.
If you have some big guilds runing around. Stop in at Icewell keep. i
picked up several armor pieces they left rotting. Also the Velium axe
is a ok starting weapon. Does ok damage and has a reasonable delay.
Least for a level 1. As you get higher you can get better stuff. Worse
case. Go to runny eye and farm around teh bank area. The black alloy
armors have half assed AC and looks ok for a SK. It'll at least get
your SK out the door.
