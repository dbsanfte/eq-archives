a 51 warrior? Think you went for the wrong zones but warriors are very hard
needed classes, team up with a cleric and monk you tank monk hits and cleric
keeps you both alive. You'll rock wherever you are. Druid warrior combo also
good, damageshield and heals no prob. But yes Druids are necro's are the
classes best capable of solo, so they won't always feel up to it. But for
the bigger parties Warriors are VERY welcome to absorb damage and surely
enough with new LOY searchfeature you must find a place to enjoy yourseld.
(now if only groups lfm would use it)
