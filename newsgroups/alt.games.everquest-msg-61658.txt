I totally agree with what you said about both of these types of camps.  I
would also like to add a little adendum...  Some players like to do the
quest from the beginning to end without killing the NPC to get the item...
Nothing is more frustrating then camping, waiting for NPC so you can talk to
them to get item and have someone else stumble in and kill them while you
are talking to them.  This has happened.  I've experienced this and have
told the player that was there to kill this particular spawn that I would
like to go through quest talk bs...  He did not want to kill NPC for quest.
He was killing for the xp.  So, I'm trying to go through the chatter with
NPC and he is there telling me You have one minute.  You have 30 seconds.
etc...  VERY frustrating.  Then he proceeds to hack on NPC before I can
finish my quest chatter.  I ended up getting the item, but would it have
killed this other player to just wait a minute or three until I was done?

And, one more thing...  LOL  (I'm on a roll here)  If people are going to
camp the guards in newbie zones, should those same players also be expected
to kill any trains that the newbies are trying to run to the guards which of
course aren't there because they've just been killed?  I say yes.
