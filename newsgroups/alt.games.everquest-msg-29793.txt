Very possibly they do, but wasn't the original question in this part of a
discussion talking about a Druid with a mana-free item soloing?  I mean, not
having played one, for all I know, the Druid in question may generate more xp
than anybody in the full group in the example given.  That was the only point I
was making.  I have no basis to compare a well balanced group of five constantly
pulling blues to how much xp a soloing druid with a good item will generate.
Could be more. Could be less. We'd have to poll the rest of the druids. The
original posters qeustion, though, related to grouping vs. soloing, and I don't
think there was any mention of mana-free items made. In those cases, I'd still
stand by the "conventional lore" of a well balanced group pulling a constant
stream of blues. :-)

Agreed. that would totally blur the line and throw my original position out the
window. Again, I've no idea. We'll have to poll the druids with mana-free items
and see what kind of xp they normally get at a given level.

Check with me tomorrow. I'm about 4 blues short of hell. ;-)
