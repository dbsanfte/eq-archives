Ok, so I finally broke down and got the expansion. It had to happen. (I 
also got ripped off on not getting the bag that's supposed to come with 
it like a previous poster here, so it seems it's an ongoing problem.)

Couple of questions. I did the running around to get my adventurer's 
stone on both my main (sorcerer) and my twink (25 cleric). I see that 
there are magi at the various adventurer camps who can insta-port you to 
the various LDoN dungeons, which is particularly nice for the cleric.

The only one I've gone to thus far is the one by the Shady Swashbuckler 
in the EC tunnel. Is this the most easily and quickly accessible camp 
from any of the PoK books? Or is there an even better one. (Not such a 
big deal for the wizard, but for the cleric it's a concern.)

Second, how low of a level do the LDoN adventures run? I mean to say, is 
it worth it to try to get up an LDoN group for an adventure when you are 
still in your twenties, or is it really more for higher levels? Both in 
terms of xp, adventure points, and loot.

Are any of the particular types of adventures more advantageous for the 
low level and/or for my level 61?
