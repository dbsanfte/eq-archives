I only play on Mith Marr and was wondering from other player that play more
than one server, is it just me or do our GM's lack ne imagination?
Every EQ website i got to there are tons of posts about cool GM events.
Never see one for Mith Marr.
Maybe ppl on Mith dont post but i doubt it.
I'm still relatively a noob , only been playin for a year, but in that short
time i can count on my one hand the amount of GM events on our server i have
seen or heard of.
Unlees you count the same ones they do all the time. i.e. werewolves in wc
or werewolves in wc or werewolves in wc.
Do Mith Marr GM's ride the short bus to work?
