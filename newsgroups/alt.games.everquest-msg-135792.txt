Well, then there's sme circumstance under which you do need it all priced, 
but it doesn't work in every circumstance.  Everything highlighted in 
green (ie, actually for sale) had a price.  But many things in my satcels 
I never put a price on.  I had 8 satchels and about 55 items, priced about 
45 of them.  Dang 30-item limit.

Amazingly, I sold more stuff than I bought. :)
