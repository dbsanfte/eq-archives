  Here is my problem,

    Verant has made it very clear that no one �owns� a camp.  That if
two groups want to hunt the same area then the first group needs to
share the spawn with the second group.  That�s the rule.

    In real life or under the �play nice� principle;  if  a group is
already �camping� a spawn it is your obligation to leave it to them.

             I can see the reason and logic behind this general
courtesy but I think there is a downside to this idea also.  We can
all list reasons why this �courtesy� is a good idea I am pointing some
of the problems with this �courtesy�.

   My example:  Karnor�s Castle.

   You   zone in at 6pm .   You do your    �/ooc   level x   X LFG� 
 If you are lucky maybe you get in a group after 30-45 minutes at one
of the undesirable camping spots.  In the meantime you hear  �Tower
group looking for bard or chanter�.    You can be online for 5 hours
and never get in one of the groups camping the desirable spots.
Unless you are a bard/chanter possibly cleric no one wants you at all,
at the good camping spots.   

            Add to this the fact that if you are camping the zone or
one of the less desirable (moat) spots other camping spots like the
tower and the courtyards will regularly pull from the area you are
pulling from.

            My solution is to not honor anyone�s exclusive right to
any camp site.  If you have a group and want to camp the left court
yard, you go and camp that area.  If the group already there complains
you say �tough�.   �No one owns this place, you will have to share or
move yourself.�

         ( The exception to this is if there is some rare spawn of a
quest item.  I can see a group who has waited killing placeholders for
hours, having a genuine claim on that location.)

        Another example, I go to SEB, I sit at the entrance.  I shout
camp check.  I see responses listing all the locations as already
camped.  What do I do, sit at the entrance for 2 or 3 hours hoping a
camp opens up.  If there is an opening there is not even a guarantee
you will get a chance, the camping spot may be passed from a group to
another group without you knowing it.

            Please, I know a large majority of you disagrees with me.
I know you think it is bad manners to not honor someone else�s camp.
To be honest I have not seen anyone not honor camps in any of the
higher level zones.  

         I fully expect that if a group of us started not respecting
camps we would be kicked out of our guilds and become persona
nongrata.  I fully expect to have to start a new guild of outcasts and
that our guild will be disliked.
