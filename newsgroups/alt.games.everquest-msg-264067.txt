To which I responded at the time:
------------
Blocking would cover that... so would REAL penalties for being attacked 
from behind for both PCs and MOBs. As much as the group of orcs would 
like to ignore the melees and gank the cleric, they'd be handily 
skewered in the back before they got to it if they completely ignored 
the 5 melees standing there.

Similiarly, 5 melees shouldn't be able to gang a mob with 4 friends 
standing there involved in the fighting, as they would have little 
difficulty doing some serious damage to your backend while you ignored 
them. Realistically they'd pair off, because if one of your opponents is 
unengaged he's far far far more dangerous.

------------

I'd *still* like to see that be the way it works. Where pairing off is 
the most efficient method of combat. Even if the individual pairs are 
not matched. Where a mob that has nobody actively engaging him is the 
most dangerous...
