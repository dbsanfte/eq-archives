Mistmoore.  Around Lv 30~40 with my enchanter I think.  It was a long
time ago so I don't remember for sure.  Got a pickup group togeather. 
We fought our way back to the courtyard.  They started pulling.  I
decided I wanted to try out my ae mez.  We got a couple in our pull.  I
mezed the extras.  They started trickling in to our pull spot from
somwhere.  got a couple adds, I wasn't having any problem with keeping
them mezed.  Then there was a train from inside.  I mezed all the
extras.  At one point I had about 10 standing around drooling.  We
killed a few off.  I was starting to run out of mana.  More kept
trickling in from the castle, or back from the parts of the train that
had passed us by.  I'm not sure which.  Then there was another train.  I
had the best cleric ever, he kept me alive somehow, I'll never know
how.  I ran out of mana, I shouted for an evac, we evaced.  We actually
regrouped and went back for more.  Suprising, usually someone takes the
opportunity to leave after an evac.  

Basicly the same thing happened again, but it was much worse this time,
we lost most of the party.  But I have to say that's the most fun I've
ever had.  

I used to love going to the old casic thule as well, but it's gone now
