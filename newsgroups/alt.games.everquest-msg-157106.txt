I believe that is true.  Unfortunately, AFAIK, no clue to this is given in
the quest itself.  We had our second attempt for one rogue fail because she
did the turn in during the daytime.  GMs told her that her hide had failed,
and thus she was agroed, well, rogues get a message letting them know about
that.  Our only speculation is that it was becuase she did the turn in
during daylight.  We will make attempt number 3 after she has collected up
all the items again, as she is not going to be getting them back from the
GMs.
