The thing is a large part of the game involves getting items.  Most
characters are item intensive.  Items increase stats that are needed
as you progress in the game, unless you are just happy to kill
kobolds over and over and you may be.  I went for the belt to
increase mana from the 2int.  Now that isn't much but it was better
than the raw silk it replaced.  As far as killing kobolds goes, they
are green and really not any fun any more.  I didn't need faction,
but I did want/need an item upgrade.  Try and see how many times you
can cast your level 49 spells if you still have the 110 int you have
at creation as an Iksar, or how much damage you do if you still have
the shortsword your warrior got at creation.  I could have said hell
with it and went to do something else in game, but then there is the
trouble of spending maybe a half hour to get back to the Warrens to
see if the spot is open for me to get the Bat Lord later.  I had
already gotten there and was not going to leave just because it
didn't drop on the first try, or second , or third  =).  Once I had
it timed out I DID do something fun, and held the camp and got the
hat.  My music/home theater system is my hobby and it is awesome so
a movie while I waited was better than staring at the monitor.

What I would like to see in MOST quests is not long camps on rare
spawns for rare drops, but more steps in the quest itself.  So it
would still maybe take the same over all time, but you would not
have to hang out and kill MoB X 20 times to get your piece.  Instead
let MOB X drop the thing every time but add MOBs A, B and C into the
quest and have them all drop what is needed every time or maybe 75%
of the time.  This way since it doesn't require a long camp you can
do a little or all of the quest with out having to stay put so you
don't lose your spot, or leave after spending an hours there just to
have the damn thing spawn and drop what you need 2 minutes later.
You can also do it any any order possibly (depending on the quest
lay-out).

Likely there is flaws in that approach to, but it seems a bit more
friendly to those of us that have a wife, kids and a job that occupy
the lion's share of our day.
