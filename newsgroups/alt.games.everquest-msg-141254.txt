}Thanks for taking what I wrote out of context.  That's always helpful.

Well.  Not really.  What you wrote simply didn't make sense, since he 
never mentioned the coldain at all.  It is safe to assume, if his CoV 
faction is amiable, that his coldain faction is, in all probability, Ally, 
and has ceased to be an effective measure of how high his CoV faction is 
at all.

}There IS a corralation between Coldain  and CoV faction.

Well, there would be, if all faction hits were created equal.  
Unfortunately, they aren't, so you can only make a correlation with othe 
peoplewho raised faction the exact same way as you.  Arena hits are 
different from GD giant fort hits are different from certain quest hits, 
and it all goes out the window if you hunted in SS for an hour or 
something.

But this particular fellow already knows how high his CoV faction is... so 
why would he be trying to guess it on the basis of dwarf faction?
