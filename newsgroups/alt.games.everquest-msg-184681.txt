Ok, I didn't really like the FU site, just don't get into that.  OTOH, I 
really enjoyed his letters to irate people who've had links put in thier 
address books.  With much trepidation, I clicked on the link to letters 
site for his other website.  I say trepidation because the other site is 
an adult site that sells pornographic videos and I really do not want to 
see smut.  I was pleasantly surprised.  That guy has a better education 
than I'll ever have, and he uses it in witty ways to respond to people 
who don't have the foggiest idea how to unsubscribe from an email list. 
  Now, I may not like the business he's in but I do like how he tells 
people off without using one swear word.  Just don't ever get into a 
funny email exchange with him, he'll post your email address on his 
pages for all to see.
