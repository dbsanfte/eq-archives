I have played two BL so far (Barb and Troll) up to level 12. 

>How is the Beastlord class? 

In my opinion, it is too early to tell. I think the class is not fully
fleshed out or finished yet. Based on the current abilities and spell
line-up the BL looks like a poor prospect for grouping at higher
levels. 

On the other hand, the BL class may be the best solo class in the game
from 9-50.

>How is the pet's damage, and how are the buffs? 

I would rate the pet melee damage somewhere between a Necro and Mage
pet. 

>What race is best for the class? 

My first impressions would rank the BL classes as follows:

1. Iksar
Pros: AC Bonus, Regen, High base WIS/DEX/AGI, Forage, Superb Hunting
areas, Night Vision
Cons: Faction, Cannot wear plate armors (GEBs, Vox Bracers, etc), EXP
Penalty

2. Vah Shir
I would rank them #2 because they seem to be the most complete as far
as quests items, and over-all game content.

3. Troll
4. Ogre
5. Barbarian

>Also, how does the class rank against other classes? 

Too early to tell

>Finally, is the Beastlord fun to play?

Until level 9 a BL is not much fun to play. They tank/melee about as
effectively as a Bard without songs. 

Once my BL (Troll and Barb) hit level 9, they became REALLY fun!!
