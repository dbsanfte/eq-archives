That is something I would like to see as well. 

At 52 a monk can BW to 70% and mend every 6 minutes. So it is very
easy for a well equiped monk so solo a constrant string of low-light
to low-dark blue mobs (Rangers could do this as well if the mobs are
animal types). As long as the mobs don't have tons of HPs (like
Giants) and don't hit for large amounts of damage 90-120s.

That being said I really don't think any monk could kill 8 single mobs
faster than a quad'er could kill 2 sets of 4, if we are talking about
the same types of mobs (level and monster type) in the same zone.

/agree 

Not all blues are created equal, and it is my experience that Quad
Kiters and Root/DoT'ers can take on MUCH tougher mobs than any melee
class at any given level.

>I disagree. Wizards are a fine class, and can contribute to any group.
>People should invite them to groups not out of pity, but respect.

The biggest handicap facing Wizards is that they do not become truly
powerful until the mid-30s. Until then they have a hard time finding a
pick-up group.
