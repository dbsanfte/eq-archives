: What do you do when the 2 critters are smashed into each other?  Well,

I do something very similar, I do /assist (off), and wait for the mobs
health bar to start to drop, then i click around till get the one with
full health and mezz it. If the health on both are dropping I scream for
people to pick one and kill it.

Dan is correct, two critters are not much to worry about.
