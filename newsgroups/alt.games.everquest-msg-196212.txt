Notice I said "my" second best spell...I'm not 65 yet, so WR is my best
haste, but the point was the haste cap, the ATK bonus of SoV is great, but
for pure haste it doesn't matter...but you did bring up a good point.

I can think of only a couple dungeons where mobs hit for 450+...crypt of
decay, plane of nightmare b, erm, um, erm, i haven't been to all the zones,
but those two for sure...try mezzing 4 mobs and having one break, the
chanter is dead the shaman has a chance...chanters have pbaoe stuns so they
have a chance and they are the kings of crowd control, but I don't think the
few times outway the many other times that you can root/park in terms of
comparative effectiveness.  Just my opinion, remember I play an enchanter
and enjoy it.

Are we talking self buffs only?  Focus plus boar or whatever its called is
going to give about 1000 roughly and you only have to cast torpor to get
back up not rerune...I'm not 61+ so i don't have the experience on that, i'm
only going off of my limited 60 level knowledge...But the Eldritch
Rune/Arcane rune is a good point and one of the few good things I think that
happened with PoP, chanters just died toooooo easy before.  There still
might be some balance issues.

Clarity is a set mana/tick ratio and yes you can give it to others, but if
you need to get your mana back fast, clarity isn't as effective as
canni...I'm not disputing clarity/c2/c3/c4 are all great and wondrous
benefits to Enchanters, but Shamans can have Clarity AND canni so um, yes.

The point that I was making is that I "feel" that shamans are the most
powerful class, you haven't stated one reason why they aren't, only that
other classes have skills, which I agree they do.  A 65 shaman gets Swift
like the Wind, which if I remember correctly is 60% haste?  Plus some haste
item and you are getting close to max if not over it.

Maybe I should refine my statement, on an average playing field, taking into
account the hardcore and ultra casual player, shamans have it easier then
all other classes?  Maybe I need to narrow it down more, because saying
overpowered excites the mobs to revolt?

A good point and I appreciat the feedback on this...the sum of my arguement
was that shamans are the strongest class, I'd say bards are a close second
followed by necros/druids/mages.  But people play what they want to play
because of what they enjoy and what they perceive as "good and bad".  I was
only trying to reply to the OP Lance for some of the insights I have noticed
with the shaman class.
