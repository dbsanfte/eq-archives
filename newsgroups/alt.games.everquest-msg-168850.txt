Those out of power tend to be more self-righteous.  Those in power
tend to be more pompous.  I have a number of disagreements with
several of the "commonly held" beliefs/positions on the right.  I am
especially not fond of "right wing christians", modern or historical.
Jesus was/is the very epitome of "liberal", while right-wingers tend
to be quite materialistic.  I'm sorry, but a political faction whose
economists and social theorists proclaim "greed is good" is, in fact,
fundamentally un-Christian no matter what self-proclaimed "christian
fundamentalists" may say, and I just can't get past that one.
