|Gee, I never guessed a druid's shield of thorns would overwrite a
|ranger's shield of lower type thorns. I just don't see why having that
|particular spell overwritten with a higher end version screws up the
|whole thing - wouldn't the DS just take up the old thorns buff slot?

	The thorns gets overwritten by the WP (I think, I'm 60 but don't have the
spell and am not particularly trying to get it; if not the WP itself then
something else).

	The offending Mage/Druid DS then overwrites the WP, which has a small
damage shield component of its own.

	Basically, a spell will overwrite the first spell on your list that
offends it.  In the sequence given here, WP will overwrite the Thorns -- and
not the Call of the Predator, which it is also incompatable with -- and then
Call of Earth will overwrite Force of Nature -- and not WP, which also offends
it.  If you get hit with another damage shield, or anything in the Divine
Strength line, you're borked and have to start over.  Likewise for the SK ATK
debuff, which SK class mobs love to cast.

	This WHY I am in no particular hurry to get it.  I've already had to
threaten to kill people over stacking issues with my spells.
