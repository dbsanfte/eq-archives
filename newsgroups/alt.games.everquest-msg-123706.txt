It's "gear" in the same way that a druid's spells
are "gear."  If you're going to allow a druid to
cast spells, the mage should have the same ability,
don't you think?

"Gear" is what you don't have when you die and appear
at your bind point.   It's the same reason that an
epic mage can transfer servers with their epic:  it's
a *spell* not an *item.*

A mage's focus items have the same relationship to "gear"
that a druid's SoW has to JBoots...
