I have a high opinion of Verant despite all i've heard about their customer
sevice.
They have an excellent game with all the depth and longevity a good RPG needs.
I understand it may not have been totally clean when released but for the past
3 months ive been playing it seems remarkably stable and well maintained.
The mind boggles at the sheer size of the code behind EQ and I think it's
testament to the skill of the programmers that it all runs as smoothly as it
does. AO in comparison is supposed to be bugged to the hilt.
I've only petitioned about three times and each time have been ansewered within
the hour with a polite guide who 'Unfortunately cannot help me with that' ;)
Im impressed with Verant and give them a big thumbs up.
