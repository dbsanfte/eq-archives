Hi Quindell.

I recently dinged 35 with my Iksar Beastlord in little over six weeks.
Basically the beastlord is horrble at tanking, however I have no
problem soloing blue cons and from time to time pulling in a group
provided I tell my pet to stay somewhere way back near one of the
casters (otherwise he comes charging as soon as I get hit). I usually
do just what one of the earlier poster said. i.e Let my Pet tank and
me heal him every so often till the monster is 50% health then I join
in. At level 35 though even the Blue cons are nasty -- I usually end
up on top, some blue cons are easy and I can take them side by side
with my pet, some I have to. The best thing I can think of for the
future as myself is that I am a cleric to my pet who will be doing
most of the damage, especially after level 39 (I imagine and from
reading from other sources) when the pet gets nice haste and buff
spells. This was the reason I chose Iksar, since the Wisdom was the
highest of all the choices, and the areas on Kunark are awesome, I
really never need to leave, and I have never really left except to
join a guild raid on SOL A.

Safe Journey....
