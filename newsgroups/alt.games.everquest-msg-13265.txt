It was Outrageous on Brell, and Prexus, Much better on Torv,  people
with a hotkeyed Report rude idiot hotkey, although for the time when we
were the only green server a significant number of rude d00ds came

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
