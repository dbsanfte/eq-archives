You may even want to try a "normal" server without specialized rules.

Good for you and your wife! I play with my husband. We've played the
following duos with a good deal of enjoyment:

shaman/monk (both 25)
shaman/wizard (well, ok, this didn't work very well)
cleric/warrior (both currently 55)
necro/necro
necro/wizard (currently both 30)

I am good friends with another married couple who play mainly cleric/ranger,
but also have shaman/shadowknight.

A druid/ranger combo is fantastic for hunting in the great outdoors. And
eventually the druid can port both of you wherever you want to go- making
binding a non issue. As far as un-resurected deaths go, yes, it's nice to
have a cleric give you some XP back. But I don't think you and your wife are
going to be horribly keen on long and involved raids required at the high
levels. Enjoy the journey to high levels, and don't worry about the loss of
XP. two blue bubbles isn't painful at all and doesn't take much to regain
until well after 40. And you can always /auction for a rez, or group with a
cleric. You do not have to be the whole group by yourselves. :)
