It's fantastic.  Probably not an EQ killer, but it will survive and take its
share of the market.  As for myself I will remain subscribed to both games
unless one of them begins to monopolize my time to the exclusion of the
other, but I do recommend at least checking it out.  You don't even have to
give them a credit card number for your first month, you just log on and
start playing.  It's had a near flawless release, it's rock stable, it's
very similar to EQ in look and feel, but it offers a lot of things that many
EQ fans want from EQ.  In other words, its similar with differences that
will appeal to many and not to others.

Definately worth giving it try.

Best Regards
