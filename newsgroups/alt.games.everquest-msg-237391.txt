After making phony claims, lying about them later, and then calling
people out only to reinforce his earlier lies with yet more, I think
it would be pretty pointless for someone like that to bother staying
anyways.

He brought this on himself. No one was interested in the posting
habits of the groups he frequents. No one forced him to bring them
back up again and again and show yet again that they just don't behave
the way he claims they do. He was under the mistaken impression he was
on solid ground with his offtopic babble. Now that he's found no
support whatsoever, it is indeed time for him to slink away.
