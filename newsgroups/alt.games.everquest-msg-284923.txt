Having spent more time looking at them, I agree with you, particularly
for the males.  Females look reasonable when standing, but I'm
surprised mine wasn't arrested, sitting down with just a Gnome Skin
Tunic on!  It was positively indecent, and I made trousers a priority
:D

I like the sitting animation, still, but the rest does look clumsy.
The running animation makes Forrest Gump look cool.
