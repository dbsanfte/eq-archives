This is why there is a PERCEPTION that druids/wizards/necros aren't
wanted in groups.  They throw on LFG then go of and solo - expecting
the world to beat a path to their door to ask them to group.  Those
of us who don't solo well throw on LFG then actively seek out groups
at the common camp spots.  I'd say a 65 necro brings just as much
to a group as my 65 mage, but the fact that I'm right there saying
"Anyone here have need of a 65 mage?" and the necro is off somewhere
soloing means I'm the one they invite.
