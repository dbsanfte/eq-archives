    Shaman are cross classes?   Uh-huh.
    Shaman get spells at level one, can be bound anywhere other 
"true" casters can be, and have the spell Gate.   Sure, they can
do some _limited_ meleeing, and they might not crumple like tin
foil when hit like say, an enchanter, but no one who has ever 
seen one get whacked on by something  would ever confuse them 
with a tank.
    One could make similar arguments about druids.
    Here's a quick way to tell what sort of character any 
particular class is.   Spells at Level 1 = Caster.  Spells
at level 9 (excluding class specific "spells" such as Lay on Hands
or Harm Touch) = Hybrid.  No spells at all = Pure Melee.
    All can be fun.  All can be tedious.  And not everyone will
agree on which is more likely to be enjoyable.

Annie <--- Likes her ranger best, probably, because she is 
           addicted to Tracking.
