I tried DxWindows with 98/ME but haven't tried it yet with 2K.
With 2K, the Windows/Alt-Tab keys will bring me back to the desktop - to get
back in is not hard:
I have to make sure that everything is minimized, call up the Task Manager
and use it to Switch back to EQ.  On occasion, I'm left with a ghost cursor
in the middle of my screen, but that's about it.
