For the first PC, try the video card driver immediately before the latest
one, I was having problems with my ATI Rage Pro LT and ended up getting it
to work by downloading the slightly older driver.

As far as lag goes, it's most likely because you're running two EQ sessions
off of a single dialup connection. The Celeron PC is probably getting more
lag because of the inferior processor. My fathers internet connection always
had horrible lag whenever I was playing EQ back when he had a celeron. He'd
be downloading music with AudioGalaxy and as soon as I started EQ mp3s that
were taking a couple of minutes at most were then taking up to an hour to
download.
