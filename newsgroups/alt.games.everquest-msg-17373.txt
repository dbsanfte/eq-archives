Make up your mind... are you running for the zone in hopes of getting
away, or in hopes of successfully exploiting the bug?  Your answer to
that question is the answer to your question <g>.  If you just wanted to
get to the zone line, you were just running away, if for some reason you
were trying to orchestrate the scenario such that the bug occurred and
succeeded, then you were exploiting the bug.  Again, its all intent, the
very same result can occur, but trying to make it happen as opposed to
it just happening is the difference.  That's why all the whiners making
snide remarks about using their spells being an exploit or logging in
being an exploit are so hilarious, its as if they are being
intentionally blind so that the simple facts can escape them.  At least
I hope its all an act, god help us all if there are that many folks
running around who are that stupid they can't see the difference.
