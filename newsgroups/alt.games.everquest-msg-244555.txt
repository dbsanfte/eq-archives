It's one of those things that's blindingly obvious when you find it,
but it's not where you would expect.  I originally went looking for it
in the macro editor, but you actually assign it to a key by right
clicking on the key and selecting it from the menu.  It's not a
command that you can incorporate into a macro - it looks like
something that you have to dedicate a key to.  I used key 15, by the
cursor pad, because it's easy to hit in a hurry.
