Did you specifically tell the install to put in the new graphics for
the old world? There is a point where it asks if you want to.

>to be honest by game looks almost identical to what i was playing last night 

I haven't done a lot of old world travel since installing Luclin, but
the place I really noticed a huge change in appearance was Rivervale,
especially in the buildings. Roof thatching, for example, now looks
like thatch instead of just being thatch colored. Wall textures are a
lot richer. Signs are *much* sharper and easy to read.
