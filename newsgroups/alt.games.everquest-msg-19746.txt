Somebody's gonna bitch about the HTML, sure ain't gonna be me...

Anyways, by this time you should be working on your quest armor, mostly
excellent reward, when I did my Crafted Pauldron quest at 25, I got about 4
blue bubbles ( and a nice piece of armor ).

You don't mention your class, but I'm guessing melee because you want a
decent weapon, put a few more levels under your belt and do the Langseax of
the Wolves quest ( might need to work on your Barbarian faction though, just
smack around most of Blackburrow, take the gnoll fangs and turn them in 3 at
a time to Lysbith McNaff in the warrior guild )  You could probably do the
quest if you got the Langseaxe at the end rather than the Langseaxe of the
wolves ( for Langseaxe you have to kill a 20-22ish guy, for the LoW you have
to kill a 22-24ish guy )

All in all, questing for XP just doesn't happen.  Any quests that give good
exp are expensive ( as in turn in this, this and a ruby )

IMHO, some of the easiest quests are given in EC, all you have to do is type
/auc WTB <insert desired result of quest here> , just remember, these quests
are usually rather expensive =P

what is one?? I'm done with like 'get me for Kobloid Hides) which u buy from
the nearest merchant rather than do the quest! All u get is some cheap old
armour and 0 xp. Whats a good quest with good xp and/or a decent weapon at
the end?
