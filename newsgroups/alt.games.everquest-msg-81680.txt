I think I found it:

    http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=2378

    "Without revealing the details of the equations the
     relationship is as follows.

     The higher of either Int. or Wis. effects both the
     chances of success and the rate at which skill
     points are gained. The forthcoming various stat
     bonuses for various skills, such as the strength
     bonus for blacksmithing will provide a success
     bonus that will stack with the Int/Wis bonus.

                  - Yakatizma"

Yakatizma is the EverQuest developer I mentioned, the one who actually
programs the trade skill code.

I was wrong when I said the message specifically said Charisma is the
stat bonus for jewelry, but I am going to continue on that assumption
unless I hear it is definitely some other attribute.
