Well, it'd be rather silly in incorporate resists into a game
(on mobs, not just players) and then not use them.  There
are mobs with resists in the game -- and mobs with more
HPs -- than other mobs of the same level.   As it scales,
you get mobs harder for some groups than for others.

> I said - do you ever benefit greatly from having a druid?

Yes -- if you lack good crowd control, for instance, a
druid's damage shield (and other debuffs/effects) make
them more useful than a cleric or shaman in the same
situation.   And other times for other healers.

But that's a "okay, we can take these reasonably well"
with a druid vs "these will be real tough" with a shaman
situation, not a "/ooc group looking for druid ONLY"
situation

And -- with the linked encounters -- they exist.

Of course it is.   You don't think needing someone to provide
crowd control is different than not wanting someone to provide
crowd control?

Ward, before;  regen, early, heal, late.   It's different.
And the rest of the tactics for healing vary as well.

Slows aren't "meaningful?"   Damage shields combined with
debuffs to provide an aggro-less AoE aren't "meaningful?"
There's tons of effective differences...

> Example?


Druids have a variety of low-aggro heals combined
with aggro-less AoEs.   They're better at mobs you're
going to take en masse than the other priests.   Shaman
are better - with slow - against the single big mob.  And
so on.

The differences in EQ2 -- at least to the point I've played -- are
more subtle (gating mobs are a type EQ doesn't have before 50
AFAIK) but still there.
