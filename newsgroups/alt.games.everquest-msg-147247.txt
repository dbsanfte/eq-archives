So, you're looking for 'reliable news', but you still believe the unreliable
news? The stuff thats being passed around is all from this thread:

All theyve shown so far is that level 60s get 75% xp from things. Theyre
working on expanding this, but the current theory is that you get a
penalty/bonus based on your level. This was done instead of actually
changing the amount of xp needed to finish a level. Level 60 is a longer
level, so you get 75% xp. Level 59 is a shorter level, so you get a bonus -
although they dont have numbers that show this yet. Personally I think this
is correct, and its not a level-wide 75% xp nerf.
