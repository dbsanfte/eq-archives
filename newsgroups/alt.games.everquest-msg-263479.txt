I would certainly agree with that except for the fact that implementing a 
module should affect another module adversely.  In a truly modular design 
you have a core, and a set a modules that are nodes off the core.  One node 
should not afect another node unless the core is faulty.  Going by your 
definition each mod is an entity unto itself, not dependant upon each other 
except for data flow.

I diffrer with you here.  Crafting is a core module as it is part of the 
player engine.  Crafting is dependant on too many game factors to be 
considered part a mod and not a core.

    You are right here.  Zones are just data tied to the engine.

Unless the engine running the mods is flawed, which is what is happening in 
EQ II.

EQ is done.  They may add new zones, new quests, but the core engine is 
done.  Even instancing was an add on mod to the core engine.  The core 
engine being the 3D handler.

Listen you could be right, and I hope you are.  However, these are only 
points pertaining to the mechanics of the game.  Its the game play itself 
that the boards are humming about.  Its an interesting problem, one I hope 
is addressed before release.
