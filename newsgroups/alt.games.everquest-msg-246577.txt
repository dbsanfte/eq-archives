I got a skill up from a plain old /say once. To respond to the
original posters question:

One: You can sit down near the Nexus stone and go afk for a couple of
days and you might get a few points. (Not recommended)

Two: There is a Language Faire in PoK in the courtyard every second
Saturday afternoon, I believe.

Three: Just send out a shout looking to start a language group in PoK,
you will usually get a few replies fairly quickly. You teach the elves
barb and human, and they teach you elvish.
