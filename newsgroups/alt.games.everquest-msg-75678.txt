What are you attempting to say here?

The K6 generally has not performed as well as more or less equivalent Intel
processors when it comes to floating point operations, but that is just an
issue of speed, not accuracy.  The only problem I recall hearing about was
in one of the Intel Pentium series processors, there was an error in the
floating point arithmetic unit, I don't recall the details.  Please give
details or a link that describes the problem you are attempting to describe
here.
