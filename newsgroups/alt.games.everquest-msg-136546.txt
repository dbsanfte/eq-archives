Man. I cannot believe you, of all people, just said that. Sure, a
person would have to be an idiot for dropping the stuff there, and a
bit foolhardy for dropping it *anywhere* for that matter, but to
justify someone taking the stuff is just incomprehensible. The stuff
has not been *discarded*. Who would discard 12k worth of stuff?!
Claiming as much is merely an attempt to justify theft.

It's not yours. Chances are incredibly high the owner is logging on to
retrieve it. It's not yours. There's not really any more to say about
it.
