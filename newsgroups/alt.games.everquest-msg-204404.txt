Yes, to tell the ending before the story, I am now the proud owner of my
own Eyepatch of Plunder.  As is my husband.  For those who didn't read my
earlier during-camp whines, we did the SF camp back-to-back, propping each
other up and alternating bathroom/food/nap breaks.  To date, we have a
total of almost 100 hours at this camp.  24 of these were in 2002,
however.

My husband sat down in IC near those gambling gnomes at 8 am monday
morning, and we left the camp with two map pieces at 11:30 am Thursday
morning.  We left the camp twice...once for 6 hours of sleep monday night,
and 3 hours on wednesday after my husband got his piece.  Lucky me, I
don't get to work from home, so he had to do most of thecamping, but I
took a vacation day yesterday so I could say with honor that someone did
not camp SF for me.

So that's about 75 hours almost straight.  It's the most punishing
experience I've ever had in EQ, not becuase of the wait (I can do
waiting), but because of my horror of being KSed.  It only takes one
person, at the wrong time, to cause it.  A normal KS...pfft...but a KS
you've been waiting 72 hours for?  AIYY!  So, as luck would have it, I'm
someone whose body reacts strongly to EQ stimuli.  WHen I raid, I have to
run to the bathroom constantly. And when I camp things, I get acid
indigestion.  I couldn't eat during the camp because I felt sick to my
stomach, nor could I take naps because of the pain. At one point I even
went into what think was shock...I was sorta shivering uncontrollably, was
dizzy, wanted to throw up.  Husband wrapped me in a blanket for awhile,
got me to drink a lot, and did some situps with me, and I returned to my
"normal" camping misery after that.  So yes, this camp was very very
intense for me, but I'm a stubborn biotch, so I don't regret it really.  
It certainly immersed me more in EQ than anything else I could have done.  
Up till now, I'd been just doing faction work...playing alts...not really
diving in. But now...man, I'm back alright.

Hard facts for other SF afficionados: 

- spawn timer reset after a rollback, so spawn timers are probably saved
in server memory, not on harddrive with other data

- first spawn was 32.5 hours after server-up

- second spawn was 28.5 hours after killing the first SF


Things a 58 ranger can do while camping SF:

- learn how to yoddle convincingly in OOC

- relearn how to knit without looking at her fingers

- tank lodizal for the first time because the pet of the 65 shaman soloing
lodi died due to pathing (RAWR!  I AER LODI TANK!!)

- make friends with all the young cougar-quadding druids, who will later
harass anyone who looks like they will KS you

- for gethow to tpe proprley becaus eyu hav no mroe brain 

- learn that when maalox, tea, bananas, and bread can't calm a
stomach...lettuce can!

So, yes, happy ending to my SF vigil.  Met lotsa nice folks, and no doubt
earned myself a reputation as a stubborn/crazy wench.
