Hi

Not sure how others are getting on, however the chat window was really 
winding me up. Couldn't see half the text that was being displayed on 
the transparent background.

Anyway a more experienced EQ friend emailed me his [textcolors] and 
[wincolors] section. Using these then gives you a black background for 
the chat window. Everything else transparent on the transparent window. 
Also sets up the colours to be (IMO) more sensible

If anyone wants these settings to amend there eqclient.ini with, then 
just email me and i'll send the two sections to you.

Alternatively someone may be kind enough to let us know what part in the 
section makes the chat window a black background. The improvement is 
worth it ;)

Miles

p.s the reason I mentioned PC Zone subscribers is we only have the basic 
game. If you have the Velorious expansion you get the wincolor command 
which allows you to amend it in EQ.
