Just as Nuclear Annihilation would be the effect, and not the cause.

Your point is not well taken. Violence against innocent people because of
government policies is still wrong. Although, your religion may teach
differently.

It is still not right to kill Joe because of John's Actions. If that's the
case, I can justify killing any man, I could also justify attacking any
person or any religion.

So... Since Muslim's and Christians both are 'religious' folks. and I want
to 'make a point' to religion.. Does that give me the right to kill Muslim's
because of the spanish inqusistion?

With your logic... yes.

If you think a change in government policies needs to happen - Then you must
talk it out. Peaceful opposition will likely bring about a peaceful result.
Violent opposition will certainly bring about a violent result.

It still boils down to this.. Regardless of what you think about western
policies, and regardless who you think is right... Attacking a country will
result in a counterattack. And I support the counterattack 100%. I don't
give a damn at this point about US policies. Personally, I think we should
pull out and leave you all to kill each other. Then 90% of the problems in
the world would be gone. That's all the Middle-East has done in recorded
history is fight and kill each other. If they are not attacking Israel, they
are attacking Each other..

The "zionist" shit is nothing more than weak propaganda. Before the nation
of Israel was even founded, they were over there killing each other. There's
no logical reason for anyone to think they are anything but warmongers. And
Wage war and kill each other for pure fun, or religion fanaticism.

Isn't that the problem with the Sunni's and Shiites now?

So now they try to blame US policies. And because "we" gave israel land for
a nation.. Don't forget.. Palestine got some land out of that deal too, if I
recall.

Or perhaps the US should do what every other country in the history of the
world has done in a situation where they are fighting those that attack
them..

Increase the square acres of the country by taking the one's it has bested..
