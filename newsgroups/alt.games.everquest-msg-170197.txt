Mekrath, here is a fun duo.
Ranger and Enchanter have so many different utility spells and abilitys.
Sow and clarity, tank and caster, fear kiting possible , enchanter fears,
ranger snares, track, enchanter can slow and haste and crowd control etc, I
love those classes the most and they go really well together too
