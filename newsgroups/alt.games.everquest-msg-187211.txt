Heres some tips for pulling in POJ. First park near the zone out.
Nothing normally wanders through the 2 halls that lead to the zone out
unless brought there. So pull to here. But keep a heads up for trains
from other people. If you are sitting medding - many of the trains
wont bug you - but there are mobs deeper in that may (like some ghost
sarnaks - forget thier name).

Beal brought up a good point about Sralm Noramir. Hes your first pull
always. If not, he'll add for sure (hes really good at adding :-p). Be
sure the hall perpendicular to the zone out halls are clear. Rats and
sentries roam frequently here.

Keep in mind that if you pull more than one critter and this is not
desired, you can train to zoneout and not bother anyone with the adds
UNLESS someone has something engaged. If you are in a group and
pulling and need to zone, warn them not to cast on you or assist in
anyway or they will have to zone too.

Once you take out Sralm (whos is harder than the others that spawn
here - alot more HPs than the others), you can work on the other rooms
in that hall. They will come singly. 2 of the mobs in these rooms (a
centaur and a barb female) are easy non casters. The dwarf chick at
the left end of the hall (if your back is to the zoneout) is an
annoying caster. Be careful with casters, often they will stand in the
hall and cast over and over and this can spell disaster if a few
sentries walk by.

Should you feel daring - pulling the sentries is very tricky. Quite
often, once you aggro them, they have a wierd habit of running off
then coming back for you. Sometimes, if i smack a sentry, it will run
the other way, hit a corner and start coming back to me. If this
happens, then all is good. Otherwise, it will continue to run down the
hall, picking up anything else in the hall that isnt already aggrod.
Once you have them in the zone out halls, wierd things can still
happen. If you are soloing, then you should be ok, but if you are
grouped and someone else generates more aggro, they can mysteriously
just start to wander off. Maybe the new pathing system on test will
help this. Dont worry about faction, none of the mobs around ZO have
any faction hits, but there are some deeper in that do.

Good luck.
