Stormhammer has an insanely low population.  Perfect if you want to solo all
the time.  I have found there to be a higher population of morons though.
Mostly due to classes that are not good at soloing trying to, makes for alot
of trains.  Good luck finding a group there, let alone a guild unless you
are already Oobah.

Economy is screwed just like any long running server that has a high average
player level.

And the genuinely new player point...  Not a chance.  Doubt that there is a
single player there that started there.  All you tend to see is 60+ or
twinks being PL'd.
