Karnors is a special case because of the zone geometry.  The way feign works
is as an aggro reducer with a *chance* of a mem wipe, *until* the mob gets
back to its spawn point.  When the mob hits its spawn point, 99% chance of a
mem wipe.  In Karnors, zone geometry prevents some (too damn many) mobs from
getting back to their spawn point, so you are relying on that *chance* of a
mem wipe almost as much as the near-guaranteed mem wipe of them getting back
to their spawn point.  Wandering mobs don't have a spawn point to go back
to, so you a relying on that *chance* totally for them.  And yeah, unless
you are high enough level to be able to single-pull them anyway, a wanderer
going back past a static mob to get to you will re-aggro the static mob on
its way.

If a mob hasn't forgotten you, and you stand back up, that mob can be all
the way across the zone and it'll still re-aggro on you.
