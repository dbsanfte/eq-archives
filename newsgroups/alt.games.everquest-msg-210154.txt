	Yes.

	The original Vision for archery was that it would only be used to pull.
The designers did not intend for it to be a usable form of combat.

	Double damage for engaged targets was added during the Dark Ages, when the
very same designers were trying in vain to make Rangers viable without
increasing their Defense cap.  Rangers capped at 200 when Kunark came out,
meaning they were torn apart in seconds by anything worth fighting at 51+.
The increases to 220 and then 240 did not come about until much later, when
the boneheads left.

	For now, go kite some blues once in a while to keep your skill capped, but
don't expect to use your bow as a serious weapon.
