My funniest day was when I was camping the Hermit with my Druid.

As a Druid, you can get into the Druid's house, and thus out of aggro
range of wandering tech Mas Gnolls. I was sitting there, medding between
spawns when someone tried to pull the Hermit from outside. The exchange
was both cruel and funny.

Ranger: "I will kill you."

Me: "The [Hermit] is camped."

Ranger: "What about the Hermit ?"

Me: "The Hermit has brought death upon himself, and is [camped]."

Ranger: "What about camped ?"

Me: "Bring me a Ykesha Short Sword, and I will [release] the camp."

Ranger: "WTF? Who are you?"

Me: "I'm the person camping the Hermit right now."

Ranger "Aww, man! I thought I'd discovered some new quest! That's fucked
up."

Me: /em giggle
