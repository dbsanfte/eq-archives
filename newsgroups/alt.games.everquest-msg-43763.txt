When a merchant has some item on offer, point at it with your arrow, then
click and hold the right mouse button for a second or two.  A window will
open showing you the speed, damage, weight, etc.

As a side note, you should also use this whenever you buy an item from
another player.  Some items look the same, so just right click and hold on
the item in the trade window to verify they are offering the same item you
thought you were buying.  Only accept the trade once you are satisfied it
is.

As for finding a character's level, the fastest way I know is to target them
and type /whot.  Well, hotkeying the same command would be faster, but
that's going a bit far.  Of course, /whot is limited the same way the basic
/who command is -- it won't tell you the level of an anonymous or
roleplaying character.
