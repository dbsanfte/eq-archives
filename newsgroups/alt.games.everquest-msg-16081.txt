This is actually how you should play eventually. The high dam nukes are
great to stop critters fleeing.
I'm a mage but I have to perform this role in many cases due to lack of a
wizard. With white or higher mobs I usually Malise (resistance debuff) a mob
then med until it's around 35-40% mana. then get up and start my nuke. 1
Major nuke is usually enough to kill it outright. if not then it's badl;y
hurt and can't run fast. A small nuke will finish it off then.

As a side note: You are THE man to stop mob nukers and healers. I know I can
kill a Rosch Mas Gnoll (lvl 31 mage mob) with 3 nukes. The problem with mobs
like these is that they usually stay at the back so the tanks need time to
get to it and the healer mobs have plenty of time to heal themselves if only
the tanks are hitting it. 1 Nuker in the group fixes both problems.

About the group part: If a group doesn't know how a wizard is supposed to
work and don't wait for mana reg. Tell them about it. They need to learn how
other classes work and can be used best. Likewise you need to know that if a
mob is hitting you you DON'T run away. Let the group know you're being hit
and a tank should taunt it off you. Make sure they understand this and you
don't run away (you'll die just as fast, only you can get out of healing
range and the tanks have a harder time hitting/taunting the mob).
