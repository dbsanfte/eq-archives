They are, it says in patch message today this is job number one for
them now. Job number one for them before this was fixing the amd zone
crash and other crash problems. Now that they think they have a handle
on that, the next one is this problem.

After that they'll probably get to other stuff like velious graphics
not showing on the new models even with them enabled, people without
luclin not seeing cat people, etc. 

They are sort of going in order of importance with all customers being
able to play at all being number one, then the quality of that play
such as zoning being number two, then cosmetic and other bug fixes
being number three. It makes sense really.
