If they wanted to retain credibility, they could give us the results of 
the poll. They also should have given us the extremes... yes, no, and 
don't care are wholly inadequate. Where's the "You do this and I'll 
quit" option. The questions of the poll fail to give the pollee's a 
proper voice...

Its only slightly better those stupid polls asking us something and then 
providing options:

somewhat agree, strongly agree, love it
