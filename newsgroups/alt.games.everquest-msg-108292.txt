1) Why is a wizzy pulling? It can be done, but not at 14th. The only
worse puller I can think of is a enchanter.
2) Most groups have no one doing crowd control. This doesn't have to
mean a mez, it can mean a warrior and a thief cooperating on mob
aggro.
3) Harmony is a spell low level groups ignore, but I think it's
useless on the orc highway.

BTW, I was on the highway once, and was disbanded during a pull. The
moron then gave me invites about six times after my CR. I petitioned
finally after he had others invite me. Everytime I saw his name in a
group, I ctl-D disbanded and left. He was like a bad penny. Find a
regular group to party with. Try Befallen, IMHO it is better than orc
highway until you have a party together.
