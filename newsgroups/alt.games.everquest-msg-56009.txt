You should be able to do Chardok, but I'd want the warrior to be 50+ just
because of agro.
Charasis?  Better wait on that one, that place is very unforgiving.
Velks? You should be ok there if you don't go in too far,
The warrior is the key, he really needs to be 50+ for those places, since he
will be pulling you'll want him to have levels to keep agro down.
