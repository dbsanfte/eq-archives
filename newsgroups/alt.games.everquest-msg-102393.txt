I think it's part of the same mentality that has to do with Jehovah's
witnesses and other organizations that try their hardest to impress their
belief system on others. They expect you to keep an open mind while they
refuse to see anything else, even if that is the miserable world they live
in.

It's part of the internet and it goes along with free speech. Everyone has
the right to say whatever they believe in, no matter how offensive it is to
others... there's just a right time and place for it. Hopefully people will
learn... but when you consider Humanity's track record it doesn't seem
likely.
