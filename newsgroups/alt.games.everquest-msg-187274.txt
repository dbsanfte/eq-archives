He's a fast little bugger, too.  He always runs from the bandit camp near
the elf merchant, past the goblin warrior camp, then down to the big rock by
the crossroads.  There he turns around and goes right over and commits
suicide on the guards at the crossroads.  I can never catch up until he
turns back to the guards.

I was amazed the other day.  I had just finished off a Wandering Greenblood
when he went running by.  I'm standing there without enough spell points
even to form a wish he won't notice me, but he doesn't even give me a look.
Lucky Day I guess, because that Greenblood had not gone down easy, and I had
some serious healing to do.

Cheers,
Eric
