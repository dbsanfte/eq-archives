The whole point of a commercial is to get people to go to the restaurant (or
any retail establishment) in the first place.  What you're selling is
supposed to bring people back, all the commercial needs to do is get the
customer to try it.  If that commercial gets people to go to Quiznos who
wouldn't have before, that's all it needs to do.  The commercial just gets
their foot in the door.
