Sorry to hear about that iksar, my point in this is getting as far as
possible without help from others, getting the key from ziglark was
the first place that i needed help, and got it by pure luck being
there at the right time, getting trough sirens grotto is next, and
that requires a more direct help from someone who can cast succor
or what the name is of the spell, not shure if i will even ask for
that kind of favor without being able to pay him for it(or her)

I have to admit that the trip to thurgadin starts to feel trivial by
now :) but i always seems to miss the gorge into GD :)
