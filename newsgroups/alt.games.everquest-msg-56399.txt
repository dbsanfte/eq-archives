Fair enough. You know what you're doing. So they were stomping on the
world's stupidest druid. Ok. Let's assume for one moment that the
world's stupidest druid can't singlehandely take down a full spawn Orc 1
camp. Now he's dead. You're not. You're in zone. You're on the hate
list. Hmmmmm..... what happens next? Yes, they would run past guard
tolus on the way to the tunnel. He could stop..... one of them? Let's
give him credit and say two.
And then?
