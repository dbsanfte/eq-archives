Bother spells dont have a fixed duration. They could fail anytime. At level
50 there are fixed duration invisibilities. Unfortunately for a necro its vs
undead. Another way is to get yourself wolfformed (or project illusions
lala) which *is* fixed duration. They will see your deity and class tho, so
if you try this, con them first.
