He means a robe with base red, not verant tint. Engraved royal velium
will not have a blue tint, but it will have whatever base tint fine
plate has (I believe it's golden on half elves). If you color
something 255 255 255 it will revert to undyed state and all armor in
that slot will have its real color.
