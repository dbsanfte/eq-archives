Well I've gone and done it....broken my promise to myself with a 
vengeance!!!!
Promised myself that I WOULD NOT BUY EQ2. Not after talking years to even 
get my two eq1 characters to level 60 with a few modest AA's. So what am I 
doing now - totally hooked on EQ2 and TWO BLOODY BOXING!!! Aaaaagh.

I like the graphics and I am surprised that even my crappy old number 2 
computer is coping pretty well. Worst thing is being newbie again - but then 
everyone else is. It is also great to rediscover the excitement of the early 
eq1 days. Hordes of players just outside the gates of Antonica bashing on 
rats and snakes and enjoying the exploration rather than just grinding away 
at levels and AA points.

PS ...must have a religious spell checker - wants to replace Aaaaagh with 
Isaiah?
