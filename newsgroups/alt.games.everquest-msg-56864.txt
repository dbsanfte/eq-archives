Well, you have to realize that you're doing some serious damage with
those chants.  At 58 with my Drums of the Beast I do 237hp/tick, which
is almost 2400hp/minute.  Sure a rouge can beat that, but a fully
hasted warrior (59 and below) will have a hard time without Primal
Velium weapons.  If I get stuck in a group with both a shaman and an
enchanter, I'm not doing any good slowing, hasting, or CC, and my
melee is pretty weak too.  I can do about 1000hp/minute with melee or
well over twice that with my chants, and since I'm happily out of
melee range, can even twist in manasong to keep the manawhores happy.
