You are right, it's a pain and as I am able to amend the situation, I shall.
I have real desire to be liked by the halflings but it would make things
easier on me if they just distrusted me and not plain hated me.

I am safe porting to all other druid rings I know of. I am often asked if I
need camo and always reply "No, they think I'm one of the good guys"
