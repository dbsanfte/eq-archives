Sexual preference was never an excuse for being an obnoxious moron.

Now, from what I downloaded last night, it seems Azeroth has you
pegged as one of the same brood as the morons in the subject line.
While your introduction as ruler of another newsgroup does come across
as somewhat along the same vein as their boasting of superior
intellect and usenet posting skills, I'm willing to give you the
benefit of doubt ;)
What you are in another newsgroup has no impact whatsoever here,
unless 'you asked for it' implies you intend to go FA troll hunting.
So, if you don't flaunt your FANG CEO status in discussions with AGE
regulars, you could do fine :)

*This* particular community? Lots of people flame each other, except
when they have a common target they can all flame. Tough skin can be
required, and occasionally killfilters. Lots of useful information,
funny stuff and interesting debates can be found, even (or
especially?) in threads with regulars yelling at each other.

The game itself? I don't know how it compares to FA, but to me it's
worth both the 9 bucks a month, the roughly 30 bucks my 2-3 hours a
night incur on my monthly phone bill, and the upgrades I had to do on
my ole computer to get it to run. I enjoy the fantasy setting, it
doesn't wear out my wrists the way mousecontrolled games like Baldur's
Gate do, I like the interaction with others (barring the occasional
moron, of course) and I love my in game friends. It makes a great
hobby as long as you don't get overly addicted and sacrifice your
entire RL to Verant :)
