	Must be my technique :-)


	Most of the stuff is green or lt blue to me or else holed
up in a fort with enough other stuff to make singling problematic, 
so I find that to get a useful kill I need to go to it.  When I get 
one it's not always in a convenient spot.  If I snare it and try to 
pull it a long way I _will_ get adds (the sarnaks do the "using XXX 
as a living shield thing too) or run into a dragoon so I usually just 
root it where I find it and dot.  Then I try to sit to save mana.  If
another good target happens by I root it and dot it too.  

	The tigers and sarnaks are social, the dragoons seem to
turn up where I dont expect them, and the other day I was attacked
by a "metal guardian" which I have no idea where it came from...

	I prefer to pull sambatas in DSP or even the Tae Ew lizards in
the feerot (which are at least a challenge) to hunting OT now that yellows
and whites are not there for me...  For much the same reasons as I like 
the giants:  no running around, safe spots to sit, and easy to get to.
