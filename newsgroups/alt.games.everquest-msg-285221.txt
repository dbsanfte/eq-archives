Not having backstab like my rogue, I can see your point and am willing to 
alter my fighting style and let the warder do damage from behind, provided I 
can get the mob turned the right way... hehehe ( I know... I can just move 
thru it to turn it in the right direction to allow the warder better 
opportunities) =)

I've only been playing EQ a little over a year, and my beastie is only a 57, 
so I'm limited to what I can do... I've earned my first AA ever, and then 
foolishly (most have said) used it on regen instead of run...  and am now 
torn trying to figure out where to split my xp... 90/10 xp/aa, 50/50, or 
something else...

As to the rest of what you said, I know the stats by sight... but the rest 
of what you said is greek to me... ( rake disc, 1k+ burst dps {damage per 
second??} and don't have any other aas yet), crit?? critical hits? I know I 
should probably be familiar with most of these terms, but don't get this 
kind of in depth discussions in groups or when I'm online.

Afraid I can't remember what my weapons are, but do know that 1 is 1h 
slashing, proc'ing 625 heat damage and an aug that does 50 ice damage and 
the other is a 1h blunt with the same proc, but different aug... so 625 heat 
dmg and a stun I think...  I also got my first vet award and use that once a 
day for 2x xp

I will difinitely have to check that zone out as I'm always looking for good 
plat resources since trades really don't seem to get me anywhere yet... Am 
an aprentice artisan and have spent alot of plat getting there... and 
realize that I need to specialize in one of the 7 basics and take it to 
300+... but haven't figured out which one I can afford and can benefit my 
bank account... ( I subsidize alot of my guild funds, along with 2 or 3 of 
my lvl 70s in the guild).

I guess it all boils down to - I'm the highest level BST in my guild (yes, 
I'm the guild leader as well), and the higher levels that we have in our 
200+ membership don't understand what I'm going thru... they speak of 
kiting, or other type strategies that don't work for me because most of my 
60+ members are wiz/nec/sk/clr/ and mages.

So... the long and short of it, comes to this... wanna be a mentor?? since 
we are both on MS?? I'd certainly get alot out of it... and would try to do 
you proud, or anyone else that responds... I'll take constructive 
criticism/advice from any that have the knowledge.  I want to be a better 
beastlord/group member/Guild Leader...
