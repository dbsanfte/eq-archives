    A buddy was cackling at all the folks who took forever to match old
armour pieces, only to have the look destroyed with SoL. I imagine soon
Allakhazam's will have new fashion tables up and you'll be able to figure
out a new look.

    Nice image - now if only we could get you to wield an Executioner's Axe
to complete the Wahammer 30 K look!

    It's a graphics glitch that can happen. You don't see the newbie tunic,
you see the underlying character model. About as exciting as looking at a
naked Barbie doll. One thing this DID reveal is that the massive boobs on
all the women are generic shape boobs, resized for each race.

    I'm happy - at work we're buying a bunch of PCs at large quantity rates,
so I was able to slip in one more PC with 1 Gig RAM and a 64 Meg GeForce3
for me. Right now on the 256 Meg RAM, 16 Meg Voodoo 3 system I have things
are slightly stuttery BEFORE loading on SoL - I do that tonight.

    Add a second. I love the hallowe'en look to them. I'll have to see if
they're still as funky now that they've been slowed down, though.

>Wolves, now, seem to be prefered 3 to 1.

    After someone described in detail what rapidly sitting and standing in
wolf form looked like, I can't look at the wolves the same. Neither could
the guards at first. ;-)
