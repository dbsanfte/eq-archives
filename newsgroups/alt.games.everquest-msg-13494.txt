No. But YOU were discussing security and trotted out your long list of
achievements which make you a computer "professional". Nifty. You are a
professional. So what?

Sorry, I am one of these lackadaisical types who count on the code I have been
supplied with.

Wrong. You are now making up definitions to suit your whims. That is, unless of
course a computer professional such as yourself could show us a reliable source
that defines it as such.

This is not semantics. I realize you desperately want this to devolve into
such, but I am attacking your stated position. You claim that computer security
is up to the individual, while I am pointing out that as long as you must log
into a site on the internet it is impossible for the individual to protect
their account and/or password.

More backpeddaling. Why am I not surprised?

So, you have gained enough wisdom from my lecture to realize that it is
impossible to protect your password for EQ, but just lack the maturity to admit
such.  Fair enough. Go in peace and be crippled for as long as you wish.
