I find it much easier to kill gargoyles in OOT (island with the 4 spectres:
but spectres stay put on top and you can avoid them easily enough).  Killing
gargoyles raised my ogre troll faction to dubious, high enough for letter
quests.

Some factions, not militia, can be raised simply by killing DF orcs, if
there are no newbies in newbie zone, killing pawns can be a fairly quick way
of doing this, get lots of pawn picks and scalps which might also be a quest

I got to amiable with hh guards before killing any bandits just by killing
the orcs or gnolls, with or without turning in scalps.  Of course, dont go
running to guards if you are overwhelmed until you are no longer kos, but
can zone instead.  Faction seemed to increase much faster here than in any
other zone ive tried (just got to dubious with qeynos guards by killing lots
of greens in blackburrow after server crashed and I was only one on for a
while)

>Not easy but it can be done.


I also am amiable with the Rivervale and Kaladim guards by killing lots of
muddies and minotaurs in Gorge of King Grobb (beholder).  This gets me close
to bank in Kaladim, but still kos with rogues that, of course, hang around
bank.  Rivervale seems more of a problem, as some wandering halfling keeps
trying to bring me down to his size, not sure what faction he is.
