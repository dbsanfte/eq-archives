(just for fair warning: this is mostly just me venting my anger, and there
is a little rambling...)

a while ago, there was a post about the newbs on everquest and what
jackasses they are.  being a newb myself, i had nothing to say about this,
but now i'd like to relate a story...

I needed a few extra plat and, being such a low level myself, had very
little trade skills.  i noticed that people in pok often get money in
exchange for casting spells, so i decided that would probably be the way to
do it.  my only spell that would be of any use to anyone, however, was
lesser summon corpse.  i heard one guy offer about 200 plat for anyone that
could summon his corpse once, so, even though i realized that guy must have
been very desperate, i figured it could be a profitable business.  i started
out in crushbone since, as i remembered, it was easy for the lower level
characters to die and then die again trying to retrieve their corpse.  'wow,
what a great starting place,' i thought.  WRONG!  "15 plat gets your corpse
back!" i shouted.  seconds later some little 12th level shouts back "HAHAHA!
why would anyone do that when they could get it back for five?" he asked.  i
decided to defend myself by telling him of the 200 plat guy.  "i'll have you
know," i said, "that one guy offered me (i know it wasn't me, but i figured
saying it was would work to my advantage) 200 plat for a corpse summoning" i
finished by saying "but i don't expect most people to be that stupid so i'm
only charging 15."  silence for a while..."well that was dumb" said the
newb.  then, out of the blue, he says, "wanna fight diphead?"  i was all
like: what the hell is this guy's problem?  "i don't think that me telling
you about someone paying me 200 plat for a corpse retrieval is any reason to
fight," i said. no answer. then i felt a little twist of sarcasm inside and
i couldn't help shouting at him, "although, i do also offer anger managment
classes!"  still no answer.  annoyed and further more pissed off, i left the
game and went to eat dinner.  now i realize that shouting across the whole
zone was probably not the best way of handling the situation...
