Another good example. Not uncommon group situation for my enchanter: Tank,
dru or clr, me, and 3 misc damage types (wiz, mage, necro, melees, something
like that).
Ok, so I have numerous jobs here:
Slow
Haste
tash
Crowd Control (Mez, root, stuns, and charm. I still mostly got groups that
wouldn't let me pull last time I was playing)
standard lineup btw:
buff swap, stun, stun (2 for 'stun-tash-stun-mez after mez resist' chain.. I
sometimes dump Tash and a stun if I can get away with it since I got GoK),
charm, mez, root, tash, slow

I'll sometimes adjust which slow or sometimes even which haste I'm using (ok
tank gets my best, all others get haste XX) when I'm hovering around 10-20
mana at best, and everyone else is 80-FM.  Why? because I'm disaster
control. I am using the L4 root because I can get back the cost in one tick
of C2.

My mage on the other hand. Load up about 4 nukes. A few utility spells
(gate? what's that?).
use ther right tool for the job, don't bother if it's just going to bounce,
Have my biggest nuke memmed for the old burndown. Of course I'm only level
25, so I don't really have this mage thing 'down' yet... And won't as I'm
not playing, but that's another story.


Actually, it occurs to me that even running oom doesn't blow your mana
efficiency.. after all, you used the mana right? it's not like you don't get
it back at the same rate. I suppose there's the argument for when your mana
regen dealer doesn't have enough to refresh mana regen (yes, I've been
there... no mana for clarity, wait a min). but as long as the whole group
doesn't hit 0, one person hitting zero isn't as bad as one or two sitting
there fm all the time.

standard xp group, unless things are running nice and average, I'll give %'s
every kill. Once we get in to a groove I only report if low for the
environment, but I feel the puller/tank/whatever should never have to ask
for mana. Some find that irritating though.
