Hey, sound like a great idea. You gonna do it.
The "current" auction price are not the same on each server, so you need
people to watch ALL sold items on ALL servers, and watch them constantly to
be sure the vendors price are adjusted all the time.

stuff, and will not pay double for it. Theyll offer a little more than
vendor prices, then youll crash the market even faster.
