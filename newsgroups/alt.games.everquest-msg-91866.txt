Monks solo the best.

Shadowknights and rangers can both solo with relative ease to L50+.
Rangers have to stick with animals, though.

If you can get a reasonably good weapon and some pp a warrior can solo
as well, believe it or not, using bind wound. This gets a lot harder
later on though.

Bards solo with ease but its boring as hell and takes too much
attention.

There are rogues who can solo, but they are the worst at it.

You're welcome!
