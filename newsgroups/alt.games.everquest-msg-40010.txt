EQ and DAoC are similar games. The big difference is DAoC will be fresh and
new. I got bored with EQ so I quit. Now I can't wait for DAoC. Not because
DAoC is some killer game, but because I love MMORPG's. When I tire with DAoC,
I will move on to the nexy big fantasy MMORPG (hopefully NWN is out by then).
