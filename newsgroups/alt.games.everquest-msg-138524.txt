A donation, is just that, a donation.

There is no proper amount.

My rule in dishing out SoWs, Bind, Chanter buffs, etc. has always been this:

Donations accepted, but there is no requirement for a donation. And "donation"
means whatever you can afford or feel it is worth to you.

I might add, that since doing this, I regularly get about 5pps for a SoW.

My Chanter, on the other hand gets 10 to 20pps for Clarity.

I have received a couple of silver or a plat in gold before, but actually,
those are extremely rare.

Even rarer is the person that doesn't donate anything. But that is the person's
choice.

I have no problem with the occasional no or "low" donation, because, frankly,
at the extreme other end, I have received 20pps for a SoW and once 30pps and
another time 50pps for a Clarity.
