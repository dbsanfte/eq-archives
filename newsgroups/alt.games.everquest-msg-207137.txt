It's hard to parse cripple and I've also never seen any conclusive
proof but you can parse the opposite. Parse your shaman pet with and
w/o a str buff and you'll see a noticeable difference. If you just
assume that cripple does the opposite (drop the mobs str) you
should(!) be able to figure out the decrease in damage from a cripple.
Not worth it on exp mobs but even a 10% decrease on raid mobs is
worthwhile imo.
