Ya, the guy's being a prick.  But you still scammed him.  10 dose potions
look the same as a one doser, and you charged him for something he didn't
get.  The right thing to do would have been to refund his money and
explain it...but then again the right thing for him to do wouldn't have
been screaming in OOC...whatever.  Offer to settle and if he's still a
prick just ignore him.
