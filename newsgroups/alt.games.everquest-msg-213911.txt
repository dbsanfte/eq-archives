The number one requirement to be a guild leader is you must be either
masochistic or sadistic or simply stupid.

My guild was created in 6/01 and is going strong but I definitely qualify
(I'd like to think masochistic).  It's a thankless job (and it IS a job
unless you don't plan on having message boards or a website).  I've made
good friends...but I could have made good friends without being GL.

Most days I log in and don't have an issue to deal with, but too often I
do...and lately I've been sending tells to people who are annoying me asking
them to stop.

So you say you're going to create a tiny guild so none of this applies to
you.  Yup, you're right...but I think you're wrong if you think it's going
to remain tiny and also survive more than 6 months.

Anyway, I'm especially burned out today...can you tell? :)  I know you're
just going to ignore this post anyway. :p
