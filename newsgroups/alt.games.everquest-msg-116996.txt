What do you mean Kill the Bard and count down how much time the group runs
to the zone. The bard is usually the first to go and the only time the group
has to go to the zone is to escort the Bard in. Bards are a great class and
a very good addition to any group, but the down fall is they are also a very
high argo and very hard for tanks to get it back.
