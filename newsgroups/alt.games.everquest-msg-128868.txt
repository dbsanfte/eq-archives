General thoughts on Ebay guides - I have papers of ownership of the
Brooklyn bridge.  Sell them to you REAL Cheap. (Note... I'm from
California...)  Anything ebay 'guides' can offer to you is as useful as
putting in $200 for a single breath mint.  Your mouth isn't going to be any
fresher than the complimentary one.  Most of the stuff they offer to you
are either a bunch of BS or stuff that has been nerfed or is well known
things you should have known to begin with.  Either way, it will still be
just as time consuming as figuring it out yourself to begin with or asking
people here.
