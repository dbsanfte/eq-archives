It is directly relevant to whether its more efficient for a
shaman to tank over a DPS melee, though; DPS suffers by about 15%
being in front of a mob, rogues much more so.  All things being
equal, a DPS melee would therefore have to beat shaman mitigation
by 30% (more like 100% for a rogue) to take the same damage from
the mob since the mob will die 15% (50%) slower.

But thats without taking stoicism into account; now the rogue
would have to be 300% better at mitigating damage than the
shaman, since if he's stoic and playing main tank his damage
output drops to a third.

I'd have to see the math on that, but again I suspect you may be
underestimating the degree to which putting the rogue behind the
mob and the shaman in front of it kills the mob faster, thus
reducing overall damage; combining this with highly efficient
heal over time means that any mob that you -can- kill with the
shaman as sponge is almost certainly dead with far less mana
expended that way than with the rogue doing the tanking.

I'm not as convinced this would be true with a ranger or monk,
but I suspect it very well might.

With a "real tank" there's every chance that the mitigation is so
much better that it overwhelms the small loss of DPS (just 15%)
and that no stoicism/torpor will be needed... particularly if
Kragg's is available of course.

I'm just speculating based on my experiences up to 52, though,
are there any higher level shaman out there who can actually grab
a rogue friend and test the various options out?
