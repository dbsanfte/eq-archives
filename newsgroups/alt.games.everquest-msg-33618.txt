DO NOT ENTER YOUR INFORMATION INTO THAT WINDOW.  (If you did already, sorry
about losing your account.)

I would bet that this is a backdoor someone got onto your system somehow.
Chances are, as soon as you enter your info into that window, it gets e-mailed
to some l33t hax0r who then steals your account.

Everquest simply never pops up a window that asks for your username, password,
server and CD key.  Funny how that's all info that would be useful to an
account thief.  I would wipe your EQ directory and reinstall everything, then
run a virus scanner, then get Zonealarm to make sure nothing else funny is
happening on your system.

But that's just me.
