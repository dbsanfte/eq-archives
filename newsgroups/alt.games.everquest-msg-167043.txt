Yes, but since my items sell no problem when I do it this way, I don't see
why I should worry about undercutting other traders.  It takes at least as
long to check other players prices as to check vendor prices... and if I'm
really in a hurry, I just check everyone else's price on an item and if
they're all lower than the vendor price, I sell mine to the vendor without
wasting my time waiting for someone to come buy it (and maybe go buy some of
theirs and sell those to the vendor, too :) ).

In my experience, rarer items rarely have more than one or two traders
selling at any one time, which means I don't really have all that much
competition.  And the more common items tend to sell for less than the
vendor price, in which case I'd be doing better (and quicker) just to sell
to the vendor in the first place.
