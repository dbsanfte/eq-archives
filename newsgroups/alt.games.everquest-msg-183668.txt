Oh sure, I remember it, but "great" is hardly the word I would use to
describe:
L30 wannabe dr00ds regularly training people with unfinished kites
because they fizzled all their mana away, or
L30 clerics who didn't know what their spells did and were instantly
demolished by the mobs on those rare occasions that they actually
got a couple GHeals off in a row because they had no Defense, or
L30 Warriors who couldn't hold agro because they couldn't hit the
mobs, couldn't gain agro because they had no Taunt skill, and ran
the cleric oom trying to heal their stupid no Defense skill asses if
you compensated for the first two by rooting a mob next to them, or
...

Oh yeah, it was "great" alright.  Stupidest way to PL ever.  /rude
