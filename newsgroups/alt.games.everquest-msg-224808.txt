    His regen was nerfed. That was what did it. The method of killing him,
melee damage + manaburn/lifeburn, could have been done last expansion no
problem. It's not like anyone actually tanked him for long or anything.

    Still disappointing that he had no death emote, though, considering that
Jaled Dar's Shade (who was also made to be "unkillable") does have such
text.
