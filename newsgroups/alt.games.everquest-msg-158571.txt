Powerleveling people with DS is interesting, and serves as a proof of
this.  Pop a DS on them and let them gather a swarm of mobs.  The mobs
kill themselves hitting the poor victim (who has recieved a massive HP
boost and hopefully a regen more than up to the task, or you have to keep
healing him) and he gets, no exp.  He has to actually do at least one
point of damage to each on his own, or they are wasted.   On the other
hand, if you can avoid casting anything on him during the fight, you get
no faction hit, even though your DS did 99% of the damage.

Now cast it on yourself and pull mobs.  Again have your victim hit each
mob at least once before it dies.  Mob kills itself hitting you, and yet
since the only damage done is the DS, which doesn't count, and that single
HP of damage from your victim, your victim gets credit for the kill.

I have heard that DS does count as far as summoning mobs are considered.
I have no evidence to present on this either way, but apparantly if a monk
pulls a mob via non damage means (sit aggro, something like that) it won't
summon him, and he can pull it back to camp.  But if it hits him enough to
get past the damage threshold via DS, it will start summoning him instead
of following.  Is this true?  I can't say.  I can say its possible to pull
summoning mobs via non damage means and not get summoned, but thats the
only part I can verify.

Only other way I can think of to damage a mob without encurring aggro is
via other mobs; set up a situation where a mob paths near another mob that
its KOS to and let them duke it out.  A mob that dies from another mob
gives no exp or faction hits.  But more to the point, the mob that lived
is now perhaps severely damaged, easy meat, yet still doesn't hate you, if
you can think of some reason you'd like that.
