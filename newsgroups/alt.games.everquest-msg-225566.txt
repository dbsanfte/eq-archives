From the shadows, the mysterious jhenders@example.com (John Henders)
(if that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

I had no problem tanking in PoV at 60 as a warrior. Kill speed hinged
on how fast the mobs were brought in, not the healer's mana, in all
cases. Occasionally if a slow was not sticking early I would have to
blow defensive disc but it comes back pretty fast and the group
certainly wasn't depending on my dps to the point that being defensive
significantly slowed things down.

I can only assume you grouped with a gimp tank or had a healer with a
poor grasp of timing heals for efficiency, because what you just said
is just not significantly true. Not only that, but refusing any
warrior under 65 in the best zone for MAKING L65s seems selfish;
imagine if everyone thought that way, so the only way warriors could
get 65 was to slog through the tier one planes or LDoN....

But then, on test you quickly learn how to maximize potential of what
you have available rather than wait for the perfect setup to arrive;
perhaps I shouldn't expect that from a production server situation.
