You made 60 in 10 months?  Hmph.  Took me 3 years to get to 60, in 43 days /played.  There
are others here who took longer.

But such is the way of the 'new' gameworld...levellevellevel...forget exploring, just get
the dingage as quickly as possible.

Most of my gear is tradeable, so it's not by any means as good as Time-plus gear.  Check
my Magelo (below).  I'm 60 now, buff out to 6.5kHP and 1.3kAC.  With my weapons and ATK, I
average around 45DPS in 1HS, 2HS, 1HB, 2HB and 2HPierce, against the fannsk and lorok in
PoStorms.

I'm in a guild where the majority of the characters are 66+.  Therefore, I *never* MT in
raids - that job is better left to the 10kHP+ level 70 characters.  Conversely, I'm nearly
always the MT in a XP group, a crawl or an expedition, and typically I'm the puller unless
there's an FD puller or a Bard present.

As you suspect, you're going to need to gear up to survive fights without being the mana
vent of the group.  If you're looking to get through those last 10 levels in a hurry
(before SOE adds 5 more!), there's really only one way to do that...get into Elemental or
gear, or higher.  Heck, all but the choicest Elemental gear may leave you wanting.  Best
to get into Time-plus gear, or dump a buttload of Adventure Points into the big LDoN
pieces..

The problem is, that to get into position to loot that endgame gear will take much more of
a commitment from you and/or your guild.  You may find that 1 or 2 crawls per night does
not net enough Adventure Points to buy the big items.  You'll also find that you have to
switch to Hard adventures as you level up, and as you approach 65, those adventures become
quite difficult to complete without an exceptionally strong group.

You may very well have to switch guilds, because building a Time-capable guild from casual
gamers is next to impossible (the 85/15 gimpage rule is a real boon).  The flipside is
that most Time guilds require scheduled commitments from their players - i.e., raid
MTuThFr nights, for 3-4 hours per night.  Most of those guilds are on loot point systems,
where your attendance nets "x" points which can be used to bid on drops...so your constant
and continued presence is mandatory if you want those big drops.

You can also group in WoS, PG or RS.  Some very nice pieces drop there, but you'll need to
get the levels to zone in.
