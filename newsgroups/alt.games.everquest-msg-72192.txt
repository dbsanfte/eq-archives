    I can't believe that I played Everquest for a full five hours in one
setting!   I know that a larg amount of you have played it for longer then
that at one sitting but in the three months that I've had it, this is a
first.  I'm playing a level 15 "all most 16" warrior in oasis.  I'm playing
on the the server that starts with a z "can't spell the full name."  I
really like oasis.  Is anyone here in the Choas Dragons Gild, that's the one
that I'm in.  One more thing, for the people that have the sol add on pack,
verant really went to a big amount of trouple to make sure that the
barbarian women have large breast, lol.  I like running through oasis
watching them bounce up and down...up and down...up and down...up and
down...lol .  Gives a whole another meaning for a guy to play a lady
barbarian, lol.  Anyways, everyone have a great day in Everquest land :)

From,
Noah
