Since this is the ONLY vendor with disciplines of any sort, for any 
class, and she's ONLY in freeport, it seems likely that she's not 
supposed to be there at all.

This idea is supported by the fact that she happens to be located in 
freeport, which was horribly mangled by the POR remake.  Many NPC's 
aren't on Find, and are listed as General Supplies (or whatever they 
call it) rather than listing the category they would normally be found in.

There are several factions in Freeport, and you don't have to fix them 
all to shop from her, for example I'm very KOS to freeport militia from 
doing a Sol Ro quest; I just have to duck whenever their patrol comes 
around.

I'm actually pretty pissed about that, by the way, they changed things 
so you get no exp for killing them even if they are blue or yellow 
(didn't try a red one) but still take the faction hits for doing so.  If 
I'm going to be forced to kill something (particularly something 
underconned) I want the exp for doing so.  Further, a previous character 
happily hunted these guys for exp and loot for several levels, and I was 
looking forward to doing it again... but no.  Its not like they serve 
any protective function for the PC's in the city; there aren't any NPC's 
wandering around there that they're KOS to!

At any rate, I have my complete complement of the disciplines currently 
available to "lesser classes", Fearless and Resistant.  As an SK, I 
don't mind so much, but I really feel for rogues, who are somewhat 
crippled by the lack of some really handy disciplines from level 20+ as 
I understand it.  Then again, I'm lacking about a third of my spell 
list, and about half the missing spells "should" be on a vendor in 
freeport who they did remove from the server.
