I have a lvl 16 enchanter. I have had enchant silver since level 8.  I had
my enchanter mostly residing in Qeynos. There was a great demand for
enchanted silver there and I  would charge 10pp to enchant a stack. That is
5gp each silver bar I enchanted. Mainly I charged this because once I
enchanted the silver they would make the same jewerly I was making and I
would have to compete with them to sell it. Most everyone I enchanted for
considered it a fair price and didn't ask for a lower price. Enchanting
silver takes time and mana. Good luck with your enchanter.
