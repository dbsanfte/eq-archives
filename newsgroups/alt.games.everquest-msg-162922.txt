I don't think he meant that there was something wrong with Iksar Necros that
would make groups not want them.  Rather, what he's saying is that if the
Necro is going to group, there are better races from the Necro's point of
view.

Iksar have better AC and they have regen, but they have a big XP penalty.
For a soloing Necro, that regen is a big plus, because of HP->mana
conversion.  Mana regeneration is the thing that limits solo casters.  The
AC is a help, too, at low levels, since soloers get hit at more than
groupers.  Iksar makes a good solo Necro choice, even with the XP penalty,
because of those advantages.

However, for a grouping Necro, regen and AC are far less important.  Heal
spells from Clerics, Druids, or Shaman will greatly reduce the need/benefit
of regen, and the mob shouldn't be hitting the Necro in a group, so the
Iksar AC doesn't make a difference.  However, the XP penalty is still there.
