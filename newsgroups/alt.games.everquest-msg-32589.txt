And are a NICE kill for the druid summoned spells, no pet owner to
take offense, and the loot is pretty decent too. The loot given to
them I think takes into account the hideously red master, who is no
longer there. I like to time my runs for about 7:00am. Many pets still
up, yellow or white while I was 19/20, die easy to the summoned
spells. Very nice distraction on a long run. Track makes it even
easier.
