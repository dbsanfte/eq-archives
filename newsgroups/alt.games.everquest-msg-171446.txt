Has the "Karana" Ranger community petitioned to have the current items
changed?

I know the Shadow Knight and Monk communities raised a stink about the
Iksar only Whistling Fist and Greenmist quests/items. In both cases
the items/quests/factions were changed to allow other races use them.
There are precedents. Perhaps a case can be made to change the Tunare
items you have mentioned? Surely it is nothing more than a flag on the
item...Since Tunare and Karana are "good" gods and are ranger dieties,
it would not be out of the question for item(s) to be usable by all
Ranger/Diety combos.
