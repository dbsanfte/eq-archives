It's a good idea, I like filtered views and EQ2 provides these for other 
things like the tradeskill recipe book, where you can create named filters 
that will display only your refined recipes, your finished recipes, or only 
those that derived from a particular rare book drop, etc. Might be messy to 
implement in this case however because the quest journal is organized in 
hierarchical outline fashion, with expandable +'s and -'s. They are sorted 
first by quest type (e.g., Heritage, Hallmark, Access, City, Prestige, 
Tradeskill, etc.) followed at the same level by zone (Antonica, 
Baubbleshire, etc) so some quest steps will appear as subitems to zones 
while others will appear as subitems to quest types, and whenever you sort 
an outline you wind up having to deal with the issue that sub items often 
don't make any sense without the context of their parent items. That might 
be why this is one of the views they don't filter.
