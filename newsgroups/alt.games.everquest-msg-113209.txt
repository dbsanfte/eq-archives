The world does not owe you a living.

I get begged for buffs any time I'm in a low level zone, and I generally ignore

the beggers.  Because I can't spare the time or mana?  No, because giving
to beggers encourages begging.

Want SOW?  Group with a SOWer.  Or offer to pay for one.  Compensate
the druid for their effort.  Buy SOW potions if you want real efficiency, those

shaman aren't raking in a fortune doing this, market prices mean they more
or less break even but it lets them work on Alchemy skill.

"Do With or Do Without" my mom used to say, which applies perfectly
to this situation.

My SOW people quite often when I see my mana is going to be going
to waste, similarly I hit worthy looking individuals up with HP/AC buffs
if my mana bar isn't an issue... and I will go out of my way to rez strangers
and refuse all payment (other than some ale if they have some, and a
good time haranging them about not carrying the essentials if they don't)
quite often.. but I in no way feel obligated to do any of this.

The fact that you are asking in good form does raise your odds immeasurably,
thats so rare on MT that it almost triggers an instictive desire to drop
everything
and do all I can to encourage this, the opposite of my equally ingrained
revulsion to helping a begger.

PS Same logic applies to ports, Clarity, rez... if you always group with
a druid, cleric, and chanter, then you'll always have the amenities at
your command.  Druids more than the other two classes will actually
have difficulty finding groups, and come to see the SOW/Port beggers
quite clearly as part of that problem.  If you can expect SOW and
Port whenever you want one, then your need to include druids in
your groups drops precipitously
