Up in the North corner of the zone (North heading from the OT zoneout
along the wall) is the spot for the ragefire camp. This is also a good
camping area because the mobs will run (feared) along the wall. However,
don't try that without a group. The mobs up in that corner tend to be
higher level than the ones you find near BW. It can be crowded there,
but at your level the BW channel is about the best spot to camp in SF.
