Looks like Dan is a really *Special* guy.  One of a kind.  Personally as
obnoxious as I tend to find Sang and his approach to answering
questions, His experiences match mine, and anyone elses I've ever
encountered.  and yes, I did get the "you will not interfere with me
Standail"(ie taunt success message) before I put a point into it, so I
KNOW it was successful, but in 12 levels, I never got an increase till I
primed it.
