Looks interesting. Just about fell out of my chair on the system
requirements, though. Everything was cool til I got to the processor
requirement:

>Processor: Pentiumï¿½ III 1Ghz 

Great googa, that's the highest minimum CPU req I've seen to date. Oh
well, guess I'm not getting in on this one for a while. :-/

Got more than the minimum ram (256 req), video card is cool
(GeForce2), etc... Dammit.
