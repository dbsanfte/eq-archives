Regen never hurts.  But if ya really want a second tradeskill beyond 200, 
go for it.

}Total 6 points Welcome to Baron

Erm.  This should be a much lower priority than Spell Casting Mastery.  I 
would get all of SCM first, then at least one point of SC Subtlety, before 
worrying about how long your buffs last.  SCM basically makes your mana 
pool that much deeper, just because you never spend the mana.  And better 
still, if you don't spend the mana, you don't have to med it back.  Trust 
me.  It makes a -huuuuge- difference.  As much difference as a Mana 
Preservation item would.  And it stacks with any MP item you might have.

}Welcome To Master
}18 Points Total So far
}9 Points DC
}9 Points MGB

I'd go finish off SCS and buff extension stuff before either of these.  
Unless I was in a raid guild, and raided a lot.  Then MGB becomes a bigger 
priority.  But DC is just a toy.  You don't need DC.  You cerainly don't 
need DC 9 point's worth.  It can be fun, but you'd be much better off 
throwing the points in Total Domination and using a real charm.  If you 
really want a toy, I'd recommend Permanent Illusion and Project Illusion.  
I've had far more fun with PI than I ever have with DC, for 2/3rds of the 
points.  Being able to perma-charm a level 46 mob is just not all that 
much better than summoning your animation, in most cases.  The difference 
can matter when you're soloing, but in a decent group, it's the difference 
between an insignificant DPS contribution and a nearly insignificant DPS 
contribution, in most cases. *shrug*

}Then What?
}I get sort of lost after that point.

Once you've gotten SCM done and put a dent in SCS, and got MGB if you 
need it (not all that improbable. :) ) you have a few key paths you can 
follow:

One you've already noticed, the buff extension line.  SCR and SCRM, 20 
points total for 50% buff extension.  You can get 15% buff extension with 
droppable focus items, though.  And even more if you wanna do the 
Prayer Shawl. :) Both is good.  And this line progresses nicely, you take 
a step up every few points and you can see a noticeable improvement at 
every step.  Problem:  Extended buffs are practically useless on raids.  
You're going to end up rebuffing the whole raid once a target anyway to 
cover the people who just showed up and/or died, and with our buffs, 
that's usually more often than the normal duration of the spells, or the 
spells with just a focus item.

Then there's the 'You can never have too much mana!' line.  Mental 
Clarity, Gather Mana, Hastened Gathering.  MC1 at two points is nice.  MC2 
and 3 feel ike you're throwing huge gobs of points in a hole in the 
ground.  But gather mana makes it sooo worthwhile.  Go ahead and rez me 
last after the raid wipes... I hit the ground with MGB voq inc anyway.  
Well, if the stars are right. :)  Hastened Gathering I've been putting 
off...  I just don't use GM so often that the refresh time matters much.

One other recommendation:  Eldritch Rune.  I just finally got it, and it's 
already saved my life sooo many times, it's unbelievable.  I shoulda got 
this first!

Skip the fewer-fizzle line and anything about critical nuking.

Being able to command your animation is nice, if you find yourself using 
it a lot, which personally, I do.  But that may be down to style.  It's a 
toy.  It trivializes farming greens. :)

Now I'm working on things to help me channel.  Channeling Focus, Spell 
Casting Deftness (the faster you cast, the less you're interrupted), 
Combat Agility, Lightning Reflexes (the less you're hit...).  These are 
all nice lines that will work in tandem with each other.

One thing:  think hard about how important having such-and-such a title is 
to you.  Having it say 'Sage' over your head has zero impact on gameplay.  
But the enchanter AAs have a zillion nice toys to play with. :)  I'm 
tempted to get GoD just so I can summon that clone of myself. :)
