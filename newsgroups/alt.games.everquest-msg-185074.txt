See I dont think this has anything to do with network code, it has to
do with whats happening client side. In short they made a poor change
here somewhere.

Never said that they were, did I.
But if they cut BW usage by say 7% that reflects some potential huge
savings and if some peeps get knocked off line so what? With SWG
coming up BW is a major concern right about now. Look SWG is a major
unknown here, it hasnt netted a single dime and Im sure has cost
millions. They are literaly betting the division on it Im sure. If
they can cut some costs say in the BW dept so much the better. Just
dont even try to claim it was for our benefit.
