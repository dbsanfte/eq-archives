    It *IS* enormous but doing that would be just plain disrespectful to you
I feel. I'll read it all but I may just reply to the summary :)

    Some basic points I'll bring up

    * I'm level 52 now, am fairly familiar with the "darkness" line of
spells, and can't imagine a wizard nuking a mob that hadn't been snared, the
example was perhaps not the most realistic but at the time it didn't need to
be to underline the point.

    * Am also fairly aware of what complete heals do to strategy, or rather
should do, it seems to take a while before people really start using them
(tanks turning up with aego etc in the 40's, a habit I got into). If an SK
was pulling and holding agro for some of a fight and a warrior was taking
agro at some point, it would really depend on when these things happened as
to how much of a pain for the cleric it would be. The only reason it would
cause serious hassle that I can see is where the SK had to go off and pull
with half his hits missing - wasting almost half a c-heal or unnecesarily
risking death on the pull.

    * having mobs flee earlier when I join a group would probably get me
fewer groups - as it is most people hate fear kiting even with a 60% snare.
The only explanation I can think of is that people are explosively lazy :)

    * SK lifetap spells have extremely limited use as they are half as
efficient as the WORST healing spells, basically a 1:1 mana to healing
ratio. Our pets are a fair bit more useful than you might think at higher
levels.

    * I don't ever solo without SOW so warriors aren't that much
disadvantaged in the running away stakes, a bigger problem would be when
things go bad running is their only option. But I don't see warriors as a
viable solo class - I don't think they need to be.

    * groups look for a tank yes because if you ask for a specific one you
drop your chance to 1/3 of getting what you need. But if a warrior and an SK
both announce LFG at once, in any zone I've been in the warrior is snapped
up even if he's a few levels below.

    * I have said a million times I don't play a warrior so I don't know how
crap taunting is. I *suspect* it isn't half as bad as people make out, and
that the main reason groups prefer classes that cast to gain agro is the
increased reliability of this method - it's not 100% successful at
generating huge agro but you can depend on reasonable amounts in very short
periods. Taunt's capable of those amounts and larger, but someone else has
to build that agro, and it may take several taunts to gain agro. My concern
if people concentrate on taunt is that it will NEVER really do the job, and
so will unbalance the game before it achieves anything in particular. Even
100% reliable taunt probably isn't going to cut the mustard - taunt just
*isn't* for building agro. Your slower is going to get beat on if he has to
recast, unless he waits 5 secs for the warrior to be able to taunt again,
and if he does that the warrior eats more unslowed damage. He'll still be
behind knights, maybe just as far behind, for pop groups. I think the taunt
skill is a red herring.

    What warriors need to compete is the ability to build up an initial
burst of  agro. I hate even suggesting it because this is the *only* area
I'm better than a warrior in a group, and if warriors are even passably good
at it, my class is back on the shitheap. Our DPS sucks, our tanking is
second rate, we're nearly irrelevant on raids, yes we can solo - but of all
the classes who can viably solo we're somewhere near the bottom of the list)
the only thing we do that makes us actually shine is out-agro warriors. We
don't out-agro casters but we can allow them to nuke a lot earlier. So
anyway if warriors get some ability to build agro it's going to have to be
done with a fine touch - or we'll be hurt comparitively. I would suggest
that they have a skill that's like taunt or bash but on a 30 second timer
that lets them crit for a large amount of damage - say 500-800hp depending
on level. What do you think?
