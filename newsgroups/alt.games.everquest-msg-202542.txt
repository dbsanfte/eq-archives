<<<<<The game is balanced for groups of players.
The game is balanced for levels of groups.
Zones and encounters are have been balanced specifically for power and 
level since the game rolled out.

KEI f**ks the low end games balance to hell and back.

Let me ask you a question how can you like a game that is "too slow" and if 
you do actually disslike it the why in hell are you still playing it all 
these years later ?

Btw the game is a chalange. Reducing the chalange reduces the reward.

HTH, now STFU,

Thanks

It's very simple.  So simple that even a simpleton like yourself should be able
to figure it out but I'll explain it to you again.  First off, I didn't like
the game that much when it was too slow back in the day of spellbooks up til
level 35 and no KEI.  It bothered me so much I eventually left.  A friend told
me about KEI and I came back.  Wow is it fun now.  But none of that should
matter anyway.  The explanation that you need is that you really don't need to
worry about me and what I'm doing.  You don't like KEI, don't get it.  But
whiners like you always get the most attention because your whining is
relentless.  You think that KEI affects the balance of the game that's fine. 
All it really means is that groups can shift up a zone higher if they choose
to.   No biggie.  It also means that people are having more fun.  You don't
like that they're leveling faster than you did.  I don't care if they are.  I
level really slow anyway because I don't get to play that much.  Your argument
is no different than than the whiners who are offended by violence or language
on tv and refuse to turn the channel.  Just turn the damn channel and quit
watching the rest of us.
