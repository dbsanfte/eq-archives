The EQ2 team has announced that it will not be announcing server names prior 
to launch, and that there are no plans to designate any of the servers 
"roleplaying preferred". There's much speculation about why, but there it 
is.

In the absence of this information, the roleplaying community has been 
actively discussing ideas for ensuing that everyone has an opportunity to 
wind up on the same server. The plan that seems to have the most traction is 
the following:

1) First choice is any server that is actually designated "Roleplaying 
Preferred" at launch;
2) If not, then the seventh server in alphabetical order;
3) If there are less than seven servers at launch, the last one in the list 
alphabetically.

I haven't yet decided where I'm going to play. If SOE had decided to 
explicitly designate one of the servers "Roleplaying preferred", that's 
where I'd be without a moment's hesitation, as I believe this designation 
attracts a certain group of players while simultaneously repelling a certain 
group of players and I like the result. But using the above method is only 
going to provide the advantage of giving those who know about it a common 
place to start, while leaving out the equally important other part of the 
equation.

So I'm on the fence. Part of me would love to join my old friends from 
Firiona Vie, and part of me would also love to go to some far corner of the 
server farm where the fewest number of players are likely to congregate and 
build a new community there. I'll decide sometime between now and launch. 
Meanwhile, I thought it would be good to get the discussion going here.
