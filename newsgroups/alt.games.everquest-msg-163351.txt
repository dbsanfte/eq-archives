You should try it at slightly higher levels, like 5 and up.

My itty bitty L8 necro got potg from my druid along with some good
equipment supplied by my ranger and enchanter mostly, and got the full
range of L60 druid powerleveling (regrowth, damage shields). I
literally did not go down either health or mana no matter what I did
or casted. I went to Unrest at L8 (Unrest is good because no one likes
yardtrash anymore anyways, so powerlevelers are welcome as long as
they stay out of the house). I dinged 9 from a bare bar in less than a
minute. I dinged 16 just over an hour later, and I wasn't even the
only person being powerleveled there, so I didn't have the whole yard
to myself..
