A guild is a means of achieving greater things. Encounters that one group
cannot do. You all work together for a common goal of progressing further
into content.

My guild started off small during Kunark expansion and has grown to 80 chars
all lvl 65. We have defeated all old content and farm Vex Thal for its loots
and are making headway into being flagged for elemental planes.

A guild that does one activity a month will get no where ever. We raid
everyday we can. The higher end of the game is entirely about raiding. You
have to raid to become better equipped to then in turn do harder events
which lead to better loot and so on round the circle. Then as you progress
you see more and more of the game.
