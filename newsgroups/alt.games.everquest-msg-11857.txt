i was waiting on the bridge in nektulos for a friend to show up when i
get bit by a piranah! WTF? so i move over a little and get bit again
for 30 points. so i get off the bridge altogether and go to the edge
of the water to see if i could shoot them with my arrow. well, a swarm
of them swim to the edge of the water and fly up out and chase me to
the EC zone! i would turn around and look behind me and yep ... they
were still there....about 5 of them swimming in mid air right behind
me. I made it out of the zone safely eith half my health left. most
definatly a bug but watch out until they get it fixed. DONT MED ON THE
BRIDGE AND GO AFK!
