Auto-attack off sure ... move a little??? Huh?  Never done that and
had no problem FDing my 53rd level monk.  You sure about that ?

Isn't the level 35 not 32?  Never mind anyway ... earty to mid 30's. 
If you wait for the mobs to retun to their spawn point there is less
chance they wil remember you.

I remember getting a shock when I started fighting frost giants in GD
and they kept coming back for another chunk of me 8-(

Cheers
