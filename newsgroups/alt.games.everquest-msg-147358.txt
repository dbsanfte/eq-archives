Bah.  Decided to eat the loss and sold the horse.  Instead of loosing
only 780pp as I had anticipated, actual loss was 1923pp.  And this was
with indif faction and 115Cha.

And yes, the difference on the mana bar is simply amazing.  With horse
I almost never went oom.  Without horse I have to stop and med.  Need
to remember to sit down more.

Happier with the SoW potions given the way I am soloing - very unhappy
about the nearly 2K I lost in this little experiment.
