The free download will only get you 'classic everquest', the old world, 
a phrase that won't make much sense till you start playing.  Trust me, 
you may as well shell out the money for Planes of Power now, you get 
classic EQ plus the new planes.  Luclin and Kunark might be good to buy 
now too. Velious you may not need at first but you will want later in 
your EQ career.  If you want to play all the playable races you need 
Classic everquest, Luclin and Kunark.  If you just wanna be a human and 
money is an issue, you only need Classic for now.   You will want all 
the expansions eventually, may as well get as many as you can right off 
the bat.

Do NOT buy off Ebay, I've found 6 auctions of EQ disks today that are 
fraudulant.  Do NOT buy from someone who says, "oh you can use this 
disk, I'll just give you my account info and it's usable", the original 
account owner can come back weeks or months later and tell verant they 
want the account, give all the info that was used to start the account 
(even though you 'change' it) and take all your hard work away from you.

I buy all my expansions straight from Sony at the station.com store.
