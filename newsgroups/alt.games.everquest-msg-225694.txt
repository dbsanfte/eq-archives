Thanks for the economics discussion, but as often happens with EQ,
real world economics aren't particularly relevant.

Brand isn't an issue in EQ. My ItemX is identical in all respects to
someone else's ItemX. A player searching the bazaar list for a
specific item is presented with a concise list of who is selling it,
and at what price. The final nod to laziness, location of the vendor,
is not specified. Given that, only a fool would give preference to an
expensive trader over a cheaper one.

Granted, there are fools aplenty in Everquest.
