Okay, I have a bit of a problem here. I've never made an Enchanter
character, despite playing since August of 1999. My main is a DE Necro, and
my alt is a Dwarven Cleric. As such, I have really no idea how to create an
Enchanter. Should I put all my points into INT, or is CHA also very
important? I already know that I should be Agnostic, so I can do the Stein
of Moggok and so that my religion does not interfere with my illusions.

Also, I chose High Elf as a race, for a number of reasons, but the biggest
one is that I love the zones around Felwithe. I've spent too much time on
the western continents; it's time for a change, I think.

Any suggestions of where I should put my stats? And -is- Agnostic the best?
Or is there a better choice so I can do quests?
