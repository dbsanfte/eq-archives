In game, playing your warrior,
at the chat window type:
/loadskin warrior 
and your new files should appear without the mana and casting bars.
You can have as many UI folders as you need to outfit the different
classes you play in game just ensure that they have all the base files
in them first then overwrite with your class specific files.


Ooops bit of an edit there for continuity o)
