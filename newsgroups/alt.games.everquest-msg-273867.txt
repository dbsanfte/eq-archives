Hold a sec let me get my shovle

Ok, you are really anal. Do you expect anyone in this world (not yours) this
one, would get all that from. And i Quote

> >"What you mean 'we', white man?"

Ahh, ok you really need to get out more...

I made no refference to boat rides, nor thee's and thou's. I have no
approximation of a world view. Re read the original contex befor putting
your foot in your mouth. And both of your responses prove my point.

> simulated boat rides while properly despising those parts of his virtual

Who is "our", I think you mean "my" as you have none, I would not include
anyone but yourself. I was just trying to start a disscussion that I felt
was interesting and that you felt the need to ridicule. It is exactly
because of people with your attitude that make the game how it is and then
cry and bitch because it does not meet "your" standards, thefore making the
game boring for the rest that do not complain...

> K, thx, bye.
What are you 10 ?

Wow...

See you soon ;)
