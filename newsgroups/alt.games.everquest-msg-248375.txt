Well they can always decide to or not based on their own guidelines. And 
many wont do an automatic add. But usually sending a request to support 
will get it added if there is a charter for it.

Of course you have to get it PAST the support person who might not know 
what newsgroups are. So I would ask to have it forwarded to the newsserver 
administrator, and provide the lines I had in my previous post to show them 
that isc.org has the charter file.
