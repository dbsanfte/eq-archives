NVIDIA all the way! I only say that because I was a
gung-ho ATI user for years. NVIDIA gpu based cards
just run better for EQ.

Pick up anything GeForce4 (and above) but only if your
motherboard is AGP 2.0 compliant or above.

Check your motherboard manual for specifics. If you dont
have the manual go online and search for the .pdf of it!

Good luck!
