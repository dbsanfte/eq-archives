OK, forgetting what NG I was in. Out of the BOX the Ti is slightly faster
than a normal older GF3. It's little more than an overclocked GF3 and
because of that it's quicker but other than that the name is the biggest
change to it.

The early tests I saw made the card look much faster but recent ones since
it's release have not proved to be quite so, dominating.

Run a GF3 at the same speeds as the Ti and guess what?
