 I don't feel Wizards are useless. You want a few with you when fighting
uber gating mobs that can't be stunned. You need to finish them off
before they gate and begin summoning people.

 Also on test are the spells that anchor mobs so they can't gate. If
these ever go live that's another benefit of having a few wizards along.

 Besides an enchanter, they are the second best class to have around in
encounters where AoE is being utilized. 

 But these are views as seen from raids and such. I'm not sure how
welcomed they are in day to day xp grinding groups other than those AoE
based.
