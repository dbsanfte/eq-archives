It seems like a lot of paladins were (are?) hung up on the image of
a paladin in platemail wielding a sword and shield in battle.  While
this is fine for roleplay, even in the bad old days you could usually
get a lot more advantage from the damage done by a two-hander than
the defensive edge a shield gives you, and this is (usually) magnified
further in groups.  So really, sword-and-board is rarely appropriate
unless caster interrupts are crucial.

LOL, 200+ STR?  I've never yet had my STR over 200.  Of course, Kaev
was built in ignorance (three years ago, I'd been playing maybe a week)
and so his stats are about as bad as they can be:  base STR 80, STA 75.
For most of his "career" STR has been at or just over 100, I found that
I could get a _lot_ more AC if I didn't try to get stats from the armor
I've been able to afford.  And AC is still king (at least until somwhere
the far side of 1200) for a tank.  Lately I've been after HP to go with
the AC and my STR has slipped back below 120.  Now 200+ STR will make a
noticeable difference, but any similar leveled paladin who was actually
being outdamaged by you had to have crappy weapons equipped, the damage
bonus, extra attacks, and better damage table are worth way more than
the extra damage you could get from a high strength.

I had a cleric friend I used to partner with sometimes (he left for
DAOC :( ) and it was fun, but really a paladin cleric partnership
is begging for more people in the group.  I'm no min-maxer, but it
just doesn't make a whole lot of sense to have all that healing and
tanking ability and not have at least once good damage dealer.
With a good weapon a paladin is at best an adequate damage dealer,
add a rogue or a monk to me (or better yet 2 or 3 of them) and the
difference in kill rate is spectacular.  I do love partnering with
a skilled druid tho, paladin/druid meshes very nicely (and the
druid doesn't risk falling asleep in the middle of his umpteenth
quad).

Yes, that would've made some difference.
I dislike the combat animations in wolf-form (I prefer first-person
view), and don't even get me started about the sound effects.  But
I just made 24 with my druid on FV and tried wolf-form and was
pleased to find the animation less irritating than i remember it
(using new UI, dunno if that matters).

Paladin should be substantially better at L20 (Double Attack).

Hey, if you're not trying to have fun then why play at all?  :)
