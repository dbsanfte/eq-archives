So stun and flash of light wouldn't have made it so he couldn't see them 
to summon/hit them?  Dang.  It just seemed like a waste to me, to throw 
all the pallies (admittedly there were only 3 or 4, and one of them blew 
his LoH early) into one group and use them *just* for LoH.

Another question about aggro - I'm assuming that by your last paragraph, 
that means that aggro builds in a constant way:

1 aggro for warrior = 1
1 aggro for cleric = 1
1 aggro for warrior = 2

rather than a give/take way:

1 aggro for warrior = 1
1 aggro for cleric = 1 for cleric, 0 for warrior?

I'm really looking forward to the raid, myself.  Another guy in our 
guild started up a halfling rogue awhile after mine and has been 
leveling like mad, and he's now 39, and I'm 35.  So we should be going 
for our epics around the same time.

Ryou
