There are both "Reef Sharks" and "Sharks" in Ocean of Tears, but both
are quite low level. (I seem to recall the reef sharks are around four
and the sharks may be tennish.) Could be a concern to a level six, but
I've never run into them out in the western part of the zone. I think
they hang out near Sisters and the Oracle for the most part.
  There is, of course, the danger of a seafury, Ali, or spectres even,
that people running for their lives train all over the zone, but that's
more rare and not normal pathing. (Hell, I saw a seafury standing in
front of the docks at Sister's last week when my Necro zoned in. What a
way to get introduced to the zone for a new lowbie just taking the ship
in for the first time!
