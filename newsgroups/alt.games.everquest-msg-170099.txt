The whole guild situation on Xev is kind of odd. No sooner does a
guild (uber level 58 to 60 min) form and start raiding that it breaks
up. Not sure why this is though and I prefer not to make wild assed
guesses. So yes its possible the xev is lagging, in fact I know it is.
Course now with pop who cares about the sleeper? For that matter who
cares for NToV, WTov, or a lot of the old content. I just wanted CoV
faction to open up some solo areas. Loot in these old zones doesnt
hold a candle to PoP in stats or abilty to get a drop.
