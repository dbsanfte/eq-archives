I do, just haven't bothered jumping in until now. I can't think of one
thing that I could buy that would be an upgrade for my cleric, and the
twinks I have are already geared up about as well as I could want. I
can't afford to buy my warrior a BoC, but I'm still not going to roll on
stuff someone in the group could use to accumulate the plat to get one
either.

An interesting anecdote for you all. My old guild had just got Sol Ro
tower access when they put the ornate mold drops in there, and I spent
quite a bit of time in there with a couple of friends and whatever other
guildmates were lfg at the time. We always ran the same system,
basically nbg on any piece that dropped, with rolls if more than one
person needed. However, if you'd taken a nbg drop, when something no one
could use dropped you were expected to pass on rolling for it until
everyone had gotten an equal number of drops. We had recently had a
change of guild leadership and one night we had the new guild leader in
the group. When we explained the system to him, he didn't like it. He
felt that dispite having been given pieces via nbg, he should still be
allowed to roll on the unneeded pieces as well. That little insight into
his personality was the start of my decision to move on to another
guild.
