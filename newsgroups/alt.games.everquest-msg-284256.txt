Once out of "lowbie levels", when you die you suffer a penalty to the
experience points you have, losing a certain amount.  If you are
barely, say 50, when you die, you might just lose enough XP to drop to
lvl 49.  That said, it's not a big problem, but getting XP back via a
rezz or veteran ability is always nice  :)

If you camp out as per normal, the pet will vanish in 30 minutes.
Thus, if you can, go into Shroud form and THEN camp, as when you log
back in, the pet is returned to you in all it's glory.  The pet's
buffs and pet toys are still on it too.  Any Temporary items on YOU
will still vanish though, more's the pity.
