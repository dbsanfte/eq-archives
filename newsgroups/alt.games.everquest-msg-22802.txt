By "lock up" does he mean that the video just goes REAAAALLLLY
SLLOOOOOWWWWLLY?

If so he'll probably want to kill a few of the graphics bells & whistles,
especially if he intends to get into those situations.

Personally I love the bells & whistles so I keep them on as much as
possible, but I do turn them down on raids or where folks will be using
"noisy" AE spells.

In display options change Particle Density to Low or Off.
Also turn down the Clipping Plane.   This can be done in Display, but it has
a keyboard shortcut of Shift Minus and Plus on the KEYBOARD (NOT the numeric
keypad...from what I understand that doesn't work).

Probably a large percentage of people use the VD3 card, btw.
