Select a hotkey slot and place your sense heading into it.
Go into options>keyboard.  Find the "User defined hotkey" for the slot you
just placed sense heading into.  Right-click on it, which should put the
cursor in the secondary slot.  Press the key you use to walk forward.  Back
out of options.  Voila!
