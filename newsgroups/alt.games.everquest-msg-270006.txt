My experience has been the opposite. Of my two Qeynos and two Freeport
characters, all had no problem getting the orc with at best a 5 minute
wait at worse 15 minutes. My characters have done orc several times
just to help out other characters.

One factor not mentioned is that there is more than one n00b isle
instance and you'd be surprised how quickly you get that orc group
moving between them and how you could end up in an instanced isle
where there were only 5 players (this happened the other day).

So your mileage will vary depending on quality of players (there is
that gaggle of players who want help, but don't go out of their way to
offer it unless it advances them somehow), instanced Isle or zone, and
just dumb luck.
