As someone that's tried.  Aggro kiting isn't exactly viable for magicians. 
Spell cast time is too long, and even with pet taunt turned off the pet will
still pull aggro constantly.  And instill doubt hasn't worked on a mob that
will give me decent experience for going on a year now.  :)  Beyond that,
anklesmasher is great (I carry one) but that mob is gonna be running at full
speed for a long time before I manage to get enough hits in on an un-snared
mob to actually proc.

> Monk / Wizard would be a bitch.

Monk/wizard is a lot better.  Wizards have no problems aggro kiting and monk
feign is enough to deal with any lapses, plus the mob stays snared.  I've
duoed with a wizard doing this before.

> Warrior / Rogue would have huge down time.

Indeed, any pure melee who will be taking hits without healer support is
pretty much unworkable.

> Rogue / Rogue would be bad as well.

At least with this combo the mobs would die pretty quick if they alternated
backstabs.  :)
