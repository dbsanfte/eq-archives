Seconded... in 2 years of playing 4 characters to high levels, CC is
by far the best dungeon I have seen for mid-high 30s.

35 you should be doing orcs.  When you hit 37 or so, move up to
spiders, and when you hit 39 move up to stalag terrors.  (Of course if
you find a good group you can do those parts earlier).

I can't say enough good things about CC.  Mobs are easy to moderate
for their level, loot is very good, necessary crowd control is minimal
compared to cazic or mistmoore.  Anyone who says there's nothing in
Velious for the pre-40 crowd has never been to CC.
