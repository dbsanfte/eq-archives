They arent green to a level 51 though...

If your looking for armour from the bank mobs, to have any realistic chance
(Im pretty sure the only chance, too) you have to kill the luitenants.  They
can pop anywhere in the bank area if you kill regular giants.  Luitenants
are high blue to me at level 60 though.

The first see invis guards I have never ever seen drop armour (or any other
"guard_xxx" and "senior_guard_xxx") but the rest of the arena has a chance
of it.  Basically the higher the mob, the better the chance of a piece
(Veterans are a good source)

Some have different loot tables though, such as the gladiators inside the
arena building (and Vindi/Statue etc)
