That's my view, too. This item (not sure why I'm not
just coming right out and saying what it is. Probably
to try and keep 'the secret'. Honestly though, I don't
see a lot of people trying to get into the business
and staying in it for long because it is pretty time
intensive. The turnover on the items is generally
fast and furious. Many times, I've spent 2 or 3 hours
getting the ingredients and doing the combining, only
to sell out that very day and have to do it all over
again the next day. My circumstances and my focus in
the game makes it so that it's feasible for me, it won't
be feasible for a lot of folks.) Anyway, this item has
a *high* turnover rate and you end up with repeat bu-
siness because it's not a 'buy one and you're set for-
ever' kinda thing. If someone decides to undercut me
by a plat so theirs sells, so be it. It just puts all
that combining off for me for a while. When they run
out and have to make the run and do the combining, then
*mine* will sell. :)
