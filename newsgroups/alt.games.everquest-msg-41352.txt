You know, at the start of this whole situation there was a Muslim guy
saying, "Hey, Jaliq-Mohammed-Salbaq-Camelherder, what's so stupid about
bombing those capitalist American fucks?"

I suppose if you're driving your car and someone steps right out in front of
you that, rather than stop, you run him over, then veer onto the sidewalk,
destroy half a dozen mailboxes, garbage bins and newspaper stands, and run
over fifty people, just to teach that first guy, who isn't even paying
attention now that you've hit him, not to step in front of you?

> or are you one the liberal fucks in this country that thinks we should
love
> everyone?

Are you one of those permanently adrenalized and hateful individuals who
should be put down like a badly-trained pit bull that can't be controlled?
Take the cork out of your ass, the shit's really backing up.
