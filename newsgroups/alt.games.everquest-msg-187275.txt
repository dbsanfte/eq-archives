    Either you've misunderstood, or I've been unclear. He's still trying to
say that he knew what a ZEM was, when every post he made shows he had only a
vague hint of what it was. That's the undefendable part. I don't expect
people to know what a ZEM is, but I also don't expect them to pretend to
know what it is either. ;-)
