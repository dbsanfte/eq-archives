Rangers have sneak - everyone will sell to you. If you get 'Don't you wood-
elves have your own merchants? Whatever, I'm not selling anything to you!', 
just stick sneak on (you won't know its worked unless you start moving 
slowly, you don't get a message like rogues), make sure you're behind the 
merchant, and then trade with them - you'll should con indifferent as long 
as you're behind them and they'll deal with you.
