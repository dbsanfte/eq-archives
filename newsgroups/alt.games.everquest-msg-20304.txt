Most wont, Rallos Zek is an example of that. 99% of the server couldn't
pvp their way out of a paper bag, imo.

With resist gear I will be *almost* unkillable (much like RZ). As it
stands now...well theres no resist gear so everyone is getting rooted
and snared everywhere :(

If they kill me and camp my corpse I will train them, if I can't train
them, then I will just log and do something else (hey they are free to
sit at my corpse 24/7 if they want :p). No one finds my bind points, and
I am always bound in a place nowhere near where I am planning to be for
the forseeable future.

Like I said, I've been kos to virtually everyone in my level range on RZ
for as long as I can remember, I do know what its like when everyone is
out to get you. And yes, I get trained and zonecamped/portalcamped etc
on RZ very regularly as well.
