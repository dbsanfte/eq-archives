Send them a copy of your log?

Send them a copy of the text where they were gloating about it?

I don't know that that would be sufficient proof, mind you, but at least 
it would be a start, and if the GM's get sufficient similar complaints, 
they could do something about it.

Of course, my experience with SOE suggests that if the past 3 or so 
years are any indicator, they won't do anything because it would simply 
be too much effort, and you aren't paying for the premium server (or 
wait, didn't they kill the "pay extra and we'll provide GM's like we 
used to provide to all the servers back when the game was young" server?)
