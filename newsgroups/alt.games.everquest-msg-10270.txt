Well, now that my Iksar shaman is level 16, I have had the pleasure of
getting my revenge on those burynai (AKA furbies) that used to
terrorize me when I was a newbie; this would happen when somebody
would train a furbie to the guards, not knowing or else forgetting
that the guards don't kill the furbies, so the furbie runs around
attacking everyone until either it wanders back into the pit or gets
killed by another player.  It is so nice to finally be able to take on
the furbies instead of having to zone or wind up getting killed!

I've mainly dealt with the burynai burrowers and excavators (and one
sapper when I was in a group).  I have heard that some of the burynais
are shadowknights and so can Harm Touch players; I don't think the
burrowers are, but I heard that some of the excavators and sappers
are.  However, I haven't run across any that have harm touched me; is
it just the ones that are in Kurns Tower that Harm Touch or do the
ones in FoB also do that?

Also, a question for you folks that play SKs:  Does Harm Touch ever
get resisted by a mob or does it always work?

Thanks in advance,
