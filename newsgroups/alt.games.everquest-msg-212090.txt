My experience with them is that they are a wee bit faster than a normal mob,
but that even when running from them non snared run 3 is enough to get to
snaring distance. It could also be that the fact that they dont quite "run"
the same way as other mobs (they dont quite fly, but I dont think they quite
run along on legs either) it provides just a bit of an illusion from what we
are used to maybe. My preffered method is to just snare em one at a time,
its not usually a problem when kei'd.
btw I am 61, I dont think I did them at 60.
