If you have Luclin, this is no longer a problem.  Take your baby mage to 
the Tox spires, get a shard from the Luclin Scion, wait for portal to 
fire, find yourself in Nexes.  Go look for the Faydwer Scion (there are 
only 4 Scions in Nexes, on in each passageway), sit in the spire, wait for 
it to fire, find yourself in Greater Fay.
I wouldn't be so quick to lave Odus though, since with the Warrens and 
Stonebrunt, you can easily get yourself up into the 30s without leaving, 
and with a bit of luck could go from Paineel to Warrens to Stonebrunt to 
Hole and be 50+ without ever leaving Odus.  :)
Being nightblind isn't that big a deal, except in dungeons now, since you 
can crank up the gamma and actually have it make a difference.
