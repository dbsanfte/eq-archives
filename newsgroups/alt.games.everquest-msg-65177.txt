Yeah, but this one works DEEP IN THE WATER, not just
at the surface, so it makes chasing down and attacking
underwater NPC's a snap.

I'm sure they'll fix it soon, but I wish they'd
reconsider how "murky" the water is normally.  It's
like mud.  If they doubled the underwater visibility,
it'd be a lot less aggravating, and a lot more "realistic".
