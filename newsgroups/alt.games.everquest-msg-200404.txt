I prefer training up Safe Fall on the ship that goes from Freeport to
Butcherblock. The vertical wall between main deck and next deck up has a
bit of a slant to it. Stand on the upper deck, run off that deck to the
main deck, then run backwards up the wall. Repeat as necessary. The fall
isn't high enough for you to take any damage. No wandering mobs to distract
you. Each attempt takes only a few seconds. It seems to me (but I can't
say for sure) that I had even better results in Walk mode instead of Run
mode. Be sure you're wearing your dex gear, too!
