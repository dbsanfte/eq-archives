There are times I like to jump on for just a bit and not worry about 
supporting or letting other players down when have to leave.  Where would a 
lvl 18 tank go to do a bit of XP solo'g or maybe some quests that can be 
accomplished alone?

I know it is a bit of an open ended question, but any ideas would be 
helpful.

TY in advance
