> How do I change the hotkeys in EQ1?

In the FAQ, this shows up as part of question 4.4:
What else can I change about the User Interface?

    The Options window (accessed via Alt-O) has many settings you can
    adjust; the Keyboard options in particular let you change which keys
    invoke various functions.  Browsing the rather long list of available
    functions may give you some ideas of ways to make the game play more
    smoothly for you, e.g. by making shift-F9 and control-F9 switch
    directly to certain camera angles rather than having to hit F9
    repeatedly to cycle through all the cameras.  (Note:  Changing which
    keys do each function will affect ALL characters played on that
    computer.)

If you try to set a key to do something and it shows up in red, it
means that key is already being used for something else.  It *can*
work to have the key do both things -- e.g., tying the left arrow
key to both "turn left" and "/doability X" is a traditional way to
skill up in Tracking, Foraging, etc.  But if it shows in red and
you don't know why, look through the other keyboard settings.

Note that you can actually assign TWO different keys for each game
function.  E.g., on my setup, "Q" turns on autoattack (since that
was the default at the time I started EQ, and I'm used to it).
That's usually fine, but sometimes I'm in the middle of sending a
/tell or typing some other command and a mob comes up and starts
beating on me, and I want to attack it.  So I've also made ctrl-Q
be an alternative for autoattack, which lets me turn it on without
having to interrupt was I was typing.

Oh, and in addition to the warning from the FAQ about the settings
affecting all characters on the same computer, the flip side of that
is that your keyboard settings are remembered ONLY on that computer.
If you go to another computer, your settings won't be there.  (I've
nearly gotten myself killed this way.  I was visiting a friend and
using his computer.  The key I use for "target nearest NPC", he has
set to "autoattack". :-)
