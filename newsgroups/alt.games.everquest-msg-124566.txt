There are a number of niggling, annoying bugs in EQ that have been
there
since I started playing about a year ago.  They don't look that hard
to fix,
but apparently are low priority for Verant.  On the other hand,
because they're
easy to fix, maybe they ought to JUST FIX THEM!

Here's my starter list.  Do you have any others?

1) Fix the stupid "scalp me when I go to a merchant bug", where my hat
graphics disappear after visiting a merchant.  What's even weirder, is
that
to me I look bald afterward, while to others I simply have no hat on.

2) Fix the flakey boats.  What's with the "you have fallen for 10000
pts of
damage."  As a work-around, how hard can it be to disable all damage
when on a boat.  I don't get it.  And why do people appear and then
disappear when on
a boat, or get separated onto multiple shuttles even though they start
out on the same one?
