    Ok although sympathetic to that situation, and not wanting to answer
glibly or be a prick (because I'm actually not), but...

    a) Couldn't you have somehow conscripted higher level/necro/sk help for
that? And if that failed, I think GM's will eventually help with lost
corpses.

    b) I bet you were more cautious ever since about losing your corpse
somewhere.

    Prime opportunity to make serious cash I would think? I mean, helping
someone out in that situation is probably FUN the first 5 times but after
that it would be a chore, and no doubt worth their while paying you for it -
and payign whatever you deem makes it worth your while. 22-32 20pp is a lot
of money (unless you're twinked) and 47-52 I'd be charging somewhere between
50 and 100pp maybe... depending on how the market took it. People pay more
than that for a rez, and frankly finding a lost corpse is worth MORE than
that and takes up more of your time. Come to think of it 22-32 you could've
summoned them...

    Yeah you'd get people being jerks and acting like it was their god given
right to have your assistance locating their corpse, but they're only
punishing themselves. And yes, dying, losing your corpse and having to pay
serious money is 3 downers in a row, but it does come back to learning. If
you know the area better you're less likely to die in some weird place.
Having said that I lost my alt's corpse for 20 minutes in east commons once
because I'd run like a baby from some orcs...

    I think you've hit a nail on the head there - in order to navigate
naturally how humans do, the landmarks do need to look sufficiently
different. SOE could've spent time working on making each tree look unique
cheaply (different sizes and different texture treatment or something)
instead of throwing in a mapping system. (I can't believe anyone thinks it
looks cool lol god it looks boring! Surely learning landmarks would be
FASTER?)

    Definitely I'd like to see more new players around, but if they make it
TOO easy, you wont GET the top people anymore - the kind of people who like
a challenge, who thrive in a harsh environment, who like having to think
hard at their tactics... who actually have tactics...... you wont have those
people if you make it so easy none of those things are relevant. And if you
make it too easy, what you will get is everyone BUT them, including more
idiots at higher levels.

    Maybe you're right and letting idiots totally dominate the pre-30 game
will be good for EQ as a whole but I doubt it. I think it will be good for
sony's bank balance and NOT good for overall gameplay. Seriouly, stupid
people should stick to stupid games - of which there is plenty of choice,
and EQ was never meant to be for the lowest common denominator.

Cheers,
James
