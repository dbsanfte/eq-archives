That's very strange. My monk wasn't uber, but in most experience grinds 
(not against uber mobs), he was taking less damage per second than most 
warriors. They did have more hitpoints though :) That may have been due 
to the fact that monk's AC was higher than that of warriors at the 
moment (around levels 45-52)
