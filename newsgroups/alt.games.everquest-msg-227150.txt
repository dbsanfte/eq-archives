If you do it over a network, copying should work, putting it in the same
directory is best, but not completely necessary.  If you copy the entire
directory to CD's for some reason, it will set all the files to 'read only',
so beware that method of doing things.  If you are going to copy the files
over your network, make sure you give it plenty of time, even with 802.11G
the transfer speeds aren't that great for directory to directory.

On the desktop, (I'm assuming XP), if you installed to default directory,
open up my computer, browse to C:\program files, right click on Everquest,
click the 'sharing' tab, then click the 'share this folder on the network'
checkbox, give it a name.  If you have your network set up (too many
different ways to do that for me to walk you through that, it should be set
up already if you are getting internet wirelessly), on your laptop, you
should be able to open up 'my network places', and you should see the folder
that you just shared on your desktop, simply drag it into your laptop's
"C:\my programs" directory.

I hope that is what you were looking for, might not have been.. :)

Good luck,
