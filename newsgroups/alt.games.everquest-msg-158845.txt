And unlike faction it effects many things, not just critters. In
the plane of knowledge you will find you can talk to a meditation
guidance counsellor who will even tell you what your current
flags are - they translate back to reminders of the quest.

So, for example...
"You recall you need to clear Mauvins name and prove his innocence"
"So and so needs you to find the proper location to enter the plane
of fire before he can open a portal to it"

things like that.

They are markers of things you have done, or committed to do, in the
game so far, and are used to see how far you can go.

Some may even be mutually exclusive - you answer nicely, life heads
one way, answer another, that quest is a different road for you.
