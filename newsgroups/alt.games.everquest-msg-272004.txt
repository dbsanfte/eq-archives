I have done it successfully, no exploits of any kind.  You do not need to 
clear the entire zone, you need to clear all the graves using a shovel 
bought from the merchant in the fort.  Clear the graves one at a time, by 
digging up the grave, which spawns one or two (maybe even three) mobs.  
Then you can safely do the final encounter with only the Necromancer and 
his two guards agroing.
