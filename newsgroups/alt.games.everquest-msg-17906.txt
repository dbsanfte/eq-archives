Most folks will end up with Alteration because that is what they are
always casting. The problem with that is that they cast these spells
while resting, when saving mana is not that important. If you use more
mana casting Skin Like XXX, big deal - just med a few seconds longer.
The exception to this may be Healing in combat.

I forced specialization in Evocation, since these are most heavily used
in combat when conserving mana is most important.

Conjuration is really only good for Swarm DOT's, which is a great line
of spells. Again, though, it is common to cast these and med while the
mob cooks - no real rush to kill things and you have time to recover
mana. Evo covers the Immolate line of DOT's and the DD spells as well -
it is the DD spells you need to save mana on during a fast fire fight.
