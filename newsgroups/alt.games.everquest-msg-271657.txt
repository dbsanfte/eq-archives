Visually, a big red sword appears and drops on your target.  I think with 
still app1 level at 20, it's doing 50 or so damage + another 11 if the 
target is undead.  I don't use it unless I'm trying to complete an Heroic 
Opportunity and my admonishing smite adept 1 is resisted.

As for mental damage, think of it as messing with your target's brain 
waves/thoughts.  Lots of enchanter spells have a mental resist check as 
well.
