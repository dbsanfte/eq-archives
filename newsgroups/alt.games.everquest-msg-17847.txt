I believe every massive online game has suffered similar opening
pains. No one seems to either fully anticipate what the load will do
to their systems, or else it's simply impossible to adequately test in
beta.

EQ looked like hell the first week or two, with problems very similar
to what you describe here.

I'm sure that Funcom will get these things straightened out, just as
Verant did. I'm looking forward to trying the game in a month or so.
