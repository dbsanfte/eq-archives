Heh, exactly my situation--and no more RAMBUS for me.

And then I didn't even play EQ2 beyond the introductory month.  It 
absolutely needs that full gig of RAM, too.  I can't say the game ever 
played smoothly on my machine, regardless of my settings, but it played 
much, much better.

EQ2 isn't exactly unplayable at a half-gig of ram, but it's very very slow 
and very very aggravating.
