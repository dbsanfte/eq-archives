I always watch the lif bar on a mob I target. If it drops below 100% I
back off. I wait a few seconds for any change to the life bar as I'm
awair that damage doesn't show at first. On many occasions I've Snared
just before someone starts meleeing and I back of and let them have
it. By sending in my pet without taunt and snaring as first spell, if
it's rooted I back of and say I'm sorry.
