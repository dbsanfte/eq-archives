I've been wondering if there's something I'm missing about rare harvests?
They seem to sell at prices multiple times higher than the best items
crafted from them.

E.g. I sold a T3 steel cluster at 10g in half an hour, and there were two
others for sale at +15g.

However, when I searched for "steel" the weapons and armor listed were only
marginally better than comparable carbonite ones, and there was no way I
would have paid more than a gold or three for them. Nor would anybody else,
it seems, because that was generally what was asked for them.

I'm now a 23 weaponsmith, and I'm wondering if I should have kept the steel
cluster for myself because it would significantly have boosted my tradeskill
career in some way?
