I personally think a little common sense never hurt anyone.  5 to 6 people
having a discussion in a dead zone in a fairly innocuous fashion isn't the
same as 50-60 people chatting on a channel at the same time.  If someone
can't sort out 2 conversations between a few people on a channel, that
really isn't the problem of the people typing.

I've always thought of EQ as a medium for communicating with other people.
Those that prefer solitude really shouldn't be playing EQ in the first
place.  (But in this great land of the U.S., I guess they have the right to
whine anyway.  Which in my opinion is usually more disruptive than the
conversations they are whining about.)

I don't see anything inappropriate or excessive about the conversation they
were having but I'm sure some will disagree.

To clear up any confusion, the OOC channel as defined in the
'eqmanual_supplement.txt' file contained on everyone's computer is:

"/ooc <text> - allows you to say something as yourself, not as your
character, heard throughout the zone.  Please only use this channel for out
of character speech, and please try to limit your out of character speech to
this channel."
