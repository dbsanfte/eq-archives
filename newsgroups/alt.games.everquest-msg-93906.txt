Umm, because it was late, and it was a schoolnight.  We have finally 
reached the point where we have 30-33 people there for VP, and the dragons 
are dropping easily.  We probably could have taken Phara, but sometimes 
you reach a good stopping point and just want to relish the fact that you 
can f*cking WALK out of VP for the first time.  
Servers are patching tomorrow, and I have to work from home all weekend, 
so I hope we can kill him Friday or Saturday.  Of course I've already 
gotten my desired VP loot (Feverblade-Bane of the Shissar), so now I'm 
just in it for the screenshots.  Well, I wouldn't mind the Grey Suede 
Boots, already have one guild bard wearing them.
