Depends on the level.
I can generally tear throught the majority of non-red casters with no real
trouble.
Unless you come up against someone who knows their class inside-out, knows
the terrain and knows how to beat *you* But the best way to improve at pvp
is to fight.

He's on TZ, so it's coin only loot. Resist gear is your friend.

At higher (49+) levels the picture changes a bit, due to the imbalances in
the Kunark & Velious spells.


As to the original question, if you want to play solo pvp, warriors are hard
to kill, do lots of damage but lack the ability to prevent the opponant form
simply running off.

From your list, I'd suggest trying a ranger. Snare is very useful.
