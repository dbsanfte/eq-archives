At 35 I was either grinding in Guk/CT or soloing in Rathe Mtns.  Granted, 
this was right after Kunark was released, so you could get groups in Guk 
and CT, but Rathe is still a bard's dream.
I would suggest hunting the cyclops until 37, especially if you're trying 
to really learn the rhythm (either 2 pulses of selos and recharm or 
selos/hymn/selos/hymn and recharm).  Once it clicks, and it will click, 
you'll find that you only have to run to zone every 10 pulls or so.  By 
the time you get the homers owned, you'll be ready to head over to the HGs 
and really have some fun.
I would think that it might be worth checking out the lizards in Feeroot 
now that they're moved out of CT.  As a solo artist, they may be JUST what 
you're looking for.  Don't forget to have you dark-elf illusion up to keep 
Hurd off your butt.
