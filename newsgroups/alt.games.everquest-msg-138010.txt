    Well, you see, um, er... I like shopping for things off vendors. *blush*
No, really. I hate the idea that Delores would be KOS anywhere that a good
cleric shouldn't be KOS. I like wandering around and seeing places.

    And, really, it makes the loot progression for clerics a bit easier to
manage. I don't challenge the other clerics for the Tunare earring, or
Yelinak boots, or Burrower tunic because I don't want to ruin faction/don't
have the faction and won't raise it just to take boots from someone
else/don't value the tunic as much as others do. So that's ten points of FT
that other clerics can get without having to compete with me. I'm getting my
FT from other things which I want, like my Shield, which I have a much
better chance than them of getting because I show up every day (unlike most
clerics) and because they already have some FT from the aforementioned
items. Just makes it easier on the officers to decide loot, as opposed to
all clerics sending tells for all FT items that are priest-usable.

    My one earring right now is an Earring of the Solstice, and the other is
a placeholder Electrum Black Sapphire Earring. Hopefully I'll be able to
upgrade the EBS to a Hoop of Emptiness, off AL. AL spawns about twice as
often as the other nameds in Ssra, so over time I should be able to get one.
It'd suit me just fine.

    James
