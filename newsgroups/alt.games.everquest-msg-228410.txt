From the shadows, the mysterious "Graefaxe" <Graefaxe@hotZZZmail.com>
(if that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

The claim is questionable, though. The giveaway is of course dropped
quest items which are almost all eventually tracked down.

I don't doubt theres a bunch of undiscovered ones out there though;
they probably all have broken keywords so no one knows they exist.
