This isn't a flame, as I have a great deal of respect for the knowledge
you've displayed in EQ in the past, but detail the ways in which a 
griefer can ruin you game in DAoC if you please.

Yes, some of the same asswipes who bother you in EQ are there, with their
lame ass names, their killstealing (or just plain XP stealing).  But so
far that has all been same realm/non pvp griefing.  In PvP the worst thing
that happened to me so far is - I died - free trip to my bind point, no xp,
no item, no con lost.  No chance for a bind point camp, no chance for
any kind of gloating BS.  A "Albion Invader" killed me.  Only differences
from getting killed by a Siabra are (a) No xp/con lost, and (b) that 
thing that killed me uses a lot better tactics than the siabra did.

Professor Tam was the worst instructor I've ever had, he taught
Advanced Calculus.  If you made a mistake on a proof, he butchered
it (score wise) but all he would say when you asked him *what*
was the matter with it was -

"To Much Hand Waving!"

A phrase I find great use for 

It's pvp 
Therefore cheaters and griefers will ruin it.

0 pts - "To Much Handwaving!"
