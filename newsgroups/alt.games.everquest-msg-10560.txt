Unfortunately, it appears that begging pays if you
are persistent about it. My son knows a player online
who is a professional beggar. This player has told
my son that he has made hundres of plat begging money
and items from other players. Since he recently was
auctioning an expensive weapon due to having just bought
a more expensive weapon with his begging money, I've
no reason to doubt his claim that begging pays.

The disturbing thing is that I'm seeing more players
following the route describe by the previous poster:
anonymous "low level" players who are looking for
whatever handouts then can find. If it was limited
to a few isolated players, I wouldn't mind so much.
People can spend their online time however they want.

What bothers me is that I'm seeing a trend towards
more and more such people, who in turn legitimize
the practice to the newbies. I'm normally inclined to
pass on unused equipment to the new folks I meet but
this sort of thing just puts a bad taste in my mouth.
What's the point of helping someone when they're likely
to be just farming the generous players? I've even heard
stories of players making low-level alts that turn
around and give all the "begging loot" to their higher
level primaries. That indicates to me that begging can
be a profitable enterprise.

Personally, I don't like thinking of myself as a cash
crop. I'll still drop an unexpected gift onto a lower-level
person that I see out working or who asks me for advice
and has shown that they really are new and trying to
understand the game. The number of times I've done
that has gone down a lot though, due to my distaste for
all of the begging I hear all of the time. Really, I'm
only ninth level, too! I can imagine what sort of sob
stories the high-levels get when they wander into town.
