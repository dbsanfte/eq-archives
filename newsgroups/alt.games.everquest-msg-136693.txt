Physical/visable "Attribute":  Has "two" hands...
Occasional/situational behavior, or "preference" : writes left-handed
( ONLY does this when writing/eating/wiping ass/jacking off )

Physical/visable "attribute" :  is male (or female)
Occasional/situational behavior or "preference": is gay
( ONLY does this in sexual situations, UNdetectable otherwise )

Its *very* MUCH a part of this discussion, and *THE* entire basis
of my position!!!!!  The problem as I see it, is that you folks are
taking something that ONLY applies to a certain situation, and
tring to "preserve that moment" so-to-speek, and apply it ACROSS
the board as if it were a physical attribute that you wear around
with you all day 7x24.  i.e. you are NOT gay 24 hours a day, sorry.

Backwards...  Its a "behaviour" that can lead to certain "attributes" (AIDS)

You're "skirting" the issue again.  Gay-ness is NOT a physical "attribute".
another person can not detect it, unless in a sexual situation. You are
NOT in sexual situations 24 hours a day.

Predictable actions which only occur in certain situations does NOT
make said behaviours carry over into other actions in OTHER situations.

Descriminating against "behaviours" is not descriminating.  Do the
Democrats agains Republicans?, visa-versa ?  Religious vs. non-religious?
Are you getting "descrimination" mixed up with plausable "sterotyping" ?

Social norms buddy..., need to read up on that whole thing?

By your own argument, what happens if I wanted to pick my buddy's ass
in plublic? - should I be able to do that without getting snarls ??

You want to edit/revise mother natures "social norms" overnight just
to "fit" your behavious.  This tells me one thing for sure: That you
are "aware" of such norms, (otherwise you wouldn't care so much about it).

No, what I'm saying is that the Y axis vary's in magnitude.
i.e. the ole "2.5 kids, and eats chicken 2.5 times a week" saying etc...

Face it, or ignore it, society's norms are based on how far you
are from that center in either direction.

Sure - thats exactally what I am saying, its selective behavior that
is keeping thoes gay genes out of the gene pool.

Your choice to indroduce a vague, subjective term "bad" here does
not go unnoticed. (nice tactic).  And IN the accepted, highly 
subjective definition of the term "bad", falls my general feeling;
it IS "bad".  ....but in *what* sence?   See ?  now we are going
even further up into esoteric, glossy, more generalizations.

No he would not.

Nope.  The sexual end of it IS what drives this to the situation 
we are at.  Remove that sexual part, and the guys would not be
in this sexual identity struggle/war.

 No offence, and I admire your time to research this, but I don't have
the time to read all that right now.  I will sometime, but right now,
I don't see that as a big priority, I see the driving need for these
people to be "accepted" as the bigger problem. Moreover, the whole
missunderstanding of the diffeence between attribute and behaviour
is the bigger problem.  In other words, if you want to downplay the
whole social norm thing so much, then WHY is this social acceptance
thing so important to you anyhow ??
