: mage?

	Starting about lvl 44 with c3 I can do just under 2k off HGs in the
	life of the KEI (3 something hours extended), provided of course
	there aren't many druids around...  Druids have ability (and they
	feel the right) to farm 3x the HGs of any other class save for maybe
	bard.

	That's in total safety.

	Without C3 it's under 1k for three hours or so.  Not exactly sure, I
	gave up trying as it wasn't worth it.  Also, without KEI it's far
	more dangerous as a mage low on mana and a good three minute run to
	the zone is often a dead mage...and without KEI you're always low on
	mana hunting HGs (you can't stand still if you want to actually get
	a HG before the damn druids do (with tracking and super-sow)).

	Basically with C3 I can pretty much be ready to take every HG I can
	get to.  Without C3 I can take two or three...then go off in a
	corner and med for ten minutes or so.  Of course mage natural mana
	regen simply sucks.  I can't wait for my necro to get to HG soloing
	lvls (he's only 29 now).  I can't imagine he'll need or want KEI to
	hunt.

	But don't make a mage; they are pretty boring.  To make a pet you
	don't summon the pet, you make him and summon a dozen items for him
	to use (armor, focus, etc).  You also summon a bunch of shit for
	yourself.  You've been logged in for 10 mins now and you haven't
	done anything but prep, and you're at 1/2 mana.  Ok, full mana, lets
	go fight.  Hmm... Send in pet...wait...nuke.  Lather, rinse, repeat. 
	There are slight differences; if you aren't using the fire pet
	you'll cast a dmg shield on him.  Maybe things will be "interesting"
	and you'll debuff with Maliesement first.  That's it.

	Thank god this mage isn't really mine.  A friend lets me play him to
	farm pp for my chars (I leave a bit on his char as a tip).  I'd
	never have been able to stand the boredom of getting this char to
	this lvl.  Of course, getting him to this lvl my friend is too bored
	with him to play him either...
