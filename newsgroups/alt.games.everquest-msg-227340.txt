Everything in there is KOS to you.  No illusions will help.

If you find that your tanks are having trouble keeping aggro off of you,
there are several things you can do.  Calming Visage on yourself, Horrifying
Visage or Trickster's Aug on the tank, Root if the tank needs help when mezz
is broken; if you have to, memblur the mezzed mob when the current target is
at 20 percent - that way you're off the hate list and the tank is on it for
doing damage to an allied mob.

There are many tricks in the enchanter's bag; use what works best in your
situation.
