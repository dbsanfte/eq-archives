Not sure if it just me but the shortcut to open all bags no longer
works. Very annoying. I reported it as a bug.

Think it's a good thing. All other ingredients scale up so why not
fuel? Just wish the recipe will say what type you need. My provisioner
(The only tradeskill I really do) recipes just says kinderling. Yes,
but what type out of the 6? Ok at his level I can guess but at higher
levels it's going to be right pain.

I like the fact books you can't use are in red, makes is easier to
identify which one you need to buy next.

Not sure about this. Means you can't hand down armour to alts. Will
reduce the amount for sell but I bet prices will go up. That in turns
means I'll be less likely to buy because I can't resell them or
hand them down.

Yep, all been reduced. Mind you after playing COH everything walks at
snails place in EQ2!

Not quite sure what the point of the con changes was, looks prettier
and the level bit is nice but its nothing that couldn't be done with
the old system.

One NPC in Willow Wood has a new voice (and sex!) plus the Restless in
Forest Ruins said a few new things while fighting. Nice but still a
cosmetic change.

Being able to go into instance that once required 3 people is for the
better. Allows you to finish off quest you couldn't before.

Also noticed there were many more NPC wondering around Antonica, ie lvl
3 Traitorous Farmers on the scarecrow fields. I assume they are there
for the new sabotage quests. Buy why level 3? No one what level will go
near that area and people aren't going to bother with the quests if
have to kill such low level mobs.

Oh, and I wish they hadn't change the colour of my Wizards canvas
blouse. I got a tell from someone asking what it was because he
hadn't seen one before and thought it looked wonderful. Personally I
think it looks hideous. All black and grey and yucky looking, not like
the nice sparkling white it was. Personally I wish SOE will lay of the
cosmetic changes and concentrate on bug fixing and adding new features.
