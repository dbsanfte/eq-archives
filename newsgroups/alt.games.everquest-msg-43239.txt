Yeah, I've noticed that Innoruuk, which used to usually be the 4th or
5th most populated server at primetime, is now down with the Zeks, at
the bottom of the list.  The odd thing is that servers with low
populations used to be lised first, it's possible that they are now
last, but more likely that Verant isn't really sorting them correctly.
