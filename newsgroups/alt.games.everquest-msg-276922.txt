I disagree. In a subscription based game wher you pay for access to play 
there is no logical reason to assume the account holder owns the 
contents of the account. Too much precedent... the contents of most 
accounts belong to the account issuer, from credit cards to to library 
cards... the actual data, "the contents" of the account belong to the 
issuer. Even in the case of bank accounts, where the money belongs to 
the account holder, the actual virtual data that represents the account 
belongs to the bank.

Since virtual items simply exist as data tokens within the account, they 
are technically no different than any information in any account. And it 
belongs to the issuer not the subscriber.

There are often laws that give account holders specific rights to access 
and correct data within those accounts (particularly with respect to 
finances/credit related accounts) and those are only required because 
otherwise the issuer has complete automonomy to manage them as they see 
fit... because they, not you, own them.

Accounts are property, data within them are property. Whether or not it 
is 'protected property' is one important question, and whether or not it 
is -your- property is just as imporant, even in the absence of an EULA.
