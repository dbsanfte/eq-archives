Why did you want to go the Velious at level 11? Rabbits are even too low for
you to get XP and there is a big gap because the next level MoBs are in the
mid to high 20s. So there is basically nothing there for you to do but die.
I would have least gotten a bind before I ran out and tried to BS a level
50+ Giant.

I made it to thurgadin solo hurray at lv 11 but you know that well that is
near the council of the guys that has a skele in ice? well i fell in i
evaded countless giants, saw  the first sucessful 10th ring war on my server
drinal and even help by sucessfully backstabbing that huge giant. Well I
cannot find anyone on who can help me so if any of you know of a wizard who
could come to qeynos and send me too the great divid to get my body i would
be ever in your debt if you can email me at darkisland14@hotmail.com

your truly
Tacit 11th lv of shadow rogue,
