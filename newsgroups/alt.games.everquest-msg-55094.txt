I disagree to a certain extent, I get the message of You should win when
conning green mobs but if that green is mid 30's I don't stand a hope in
melee. I'd prefer a few green messages, one that says the mob would be no
challenge, one that says the mob can cause me problems and one that says
it's a gamble. Blues I know I cannot solo, I, begrudgingly, accept the fact
but there are plenty of greens that will tear me limb from limb but not give
me exp, I'd like to have an idea that this might be the case. As I said
earlier, at lower levels you get 2 messages for green and then 2 for Blue.
Why not give the high levels (come on, we're the ones with all the exp) 3
messages for green and maybe 2 for blue. Help the melee classes avoid deaths
at the hands of some lower level mob and help he people hunting with
partners or small groups pick their prey better.

The colours no longer mean what they may have done once but the text could
at least be a bit more informative.

Prolly asking too much this late in the games life, it just seems to make
sense to me.
