If it helps any, at higher levels, groups will tend to give the clerics any
precious gems and or spell component gems to make up for their Symbol
casting costs.  At 12PP a pop I tend to only cast Marzin on the tanks and
Pinzarn (1PP a cast) on the rest.  I often go out grouping and return with
far less than I went out with.  I can easily use up 50+PP and hour in
buffing costs.  If we are in for a serious fight one round of Marzin is 72PP
alone.  On the other hand, being a cleric, some guy can drag a corpse up to
me, ask for a rez and throw 100PP in my trade window.  I think for me it is
not so much the cost, but the fact that some people take for granted your
casting these spells and dont appreciate the fact that casting these spells
adds up to a significant amount of platinum.
