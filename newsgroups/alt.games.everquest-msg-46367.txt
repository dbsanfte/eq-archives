Well, my point was mainly that you directed your speech to the american
public, not the world in general.

Terrorism in the form of suicide attacks is only employed by groups and
beings who have no alternatives. A good example are the Palestinians, who
have been forcefully removed from their land, had appeals rejected by united
nations councils and are repressed by a country which is backed up by
world's strongest superpower.

Afghanistan and other countries like it live in poverty because of economic
sanctions and in several cases big corporations who claim their national
resources. If the world doesn't help them out they try to get some attention
by any means possible. And for some extremists this is the way they choose.

Give them no reason and you won't have the problem.

Of course there will always be madmen, but those won't coordinate and can
usually be caught by police, Interpol and agencies like that.

Fast as in within 2 to 3 hours knowing the terrorists names, relatives and
where they were trained?
The evidence to support the Bin Laden claim consisted of 1 person who had a
contact with him years and years ago and was in the plane. After that all
effort was directed to finding incremenating evidence for Mr. Bin Laden.

Also several countries demanded evidence before they would chose sides, but
the USA wanted everyone on their side simply because they said so. Threats
were made to hand over Bin Laden without giving evidence for days on ends.
Yesterday evidence was finally supplied, but half the world is already
buckling up for Afghanistan Bashing.

It might still be Bin Laden, and evidence as it looks like now certainly
points in that direction, but the decisions were made before the facts were
straight. That's what bothers me most to be honest.

I am responsible, but don't say I'm anti-america or pro-islam or something
like that.
You never know what spam I might get on my posts after that :-/

I disagree. Several people went online to play Everquest to escape the sep
11th horrors and get their mind off of it. If I want to hear opinions or
'advice' I go to the spots on the net where I can get that. That's on of the
best things about Internet, it's isn't shoved down in your throat like TV,
but you go looking when you want info on something.

Being atheist and fatalist I don't care when I die, as long as there isn't
much pain in advance. Up to that point I try to have as much fun in my life
as I can.

Worrying your life away if and when another terrorist strike might happen is
not my way to have fun.
Living in a country that has the most tolerance of any other country in the
world also helps.
