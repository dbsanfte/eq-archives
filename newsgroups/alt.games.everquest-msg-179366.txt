I guess I'm not the King of France, nor will I ever be, nor would I ever
want to be, as I am not a king, I am a prophet which is a different thing.

I guess the church will not be divided into two pieces that would not be
acceptable

I mean I'm manipulating complex ideas around in my head and occasionally I
will go too far with an idea.

I don't have a clue what was in that 3 verse mixture or if that is
considered evil to do that, but it was what I was led to do.

God basically abandoned me tonight and I ended up reading James and realized
a lot of the things I am doing wrong, and realized I don't need to be the
King of France to get anything I want, I just need to be close to God and
ask for it, so I did as I desperately need someone besides God who can
understand what I am doing and going through so I prayed for someone.
Basically God told me that if I am good enough to pray for the rain to stop
for a month during the winter, then certainly I could pray for a girlfriend
one would think and that I hadn't tried doing that once this whole time.
