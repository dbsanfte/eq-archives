The 255 is only a minor thing.  The issue was that when the class was first
created it was a skills based class.  Not an armor or equipment based.
Monks held the king of the hill when it came to melee skills.  For Warriors
is was getting the best armor and weapons they could find.  As the game
grew, it evolved into an equipment based game, skill played less and less of
a role in overall playability of a class.  Also when you use separate
offensive and defensive tables for classes it pretty much makes having a
skill of a certain number meaningless compared to another class.

This was what first hurt the monk class.  Instead of their skills giving
them the upper hand they were now destined to try and find equipment to keep
up, an idea that was not in the minds of the original idea of what a monk
was suppose to represent.  The game has changed so much since then that
giving monks a pardon on the nerfage will not make much of a difference to
the class.  The class needs to be revamped and overhauled.  I have only
played the game since Kunark but some close friends of mine have played
since day one.  They have always said that Kunark was the last good
expansion and that from Velious onward the quality that went into the game
has been going downhill.  This dose not mean the game is not a fun game to
play, it just means that less and less consideration has been given to how
new expansions and changes will effect the classes.
