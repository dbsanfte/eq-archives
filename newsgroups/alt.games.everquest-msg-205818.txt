5 is my self-imposed limit.  After that it just becomes too much like work.
Thats partly to do with my setup, though.

4 (normally), 5 if girlf (cleric) is working

I have 3 PC's (2 on a KVM switch) and a laptop.  So I only have 3 screens.
The 2 pc's run 2 sessions of EQW, and the laptop is dedicated. Anything more
than that and the lag renders it nolonger fun.

Laptop: enc.
PC1: monk (EQW: Cleric)
PC2: shaman (EQW: Rogue)

Chanter tashes, cripples, nukes several times during the fight
Monk pulls and tanks
Cleric MoR's, Casts hammer pet, and heals.
Shaman slows, keeps avatar fresh, sends pet in, casts 1 dot, and melees.
Rogue is active for about 85% of his backstabs.

Chanter can't do any more.. his nuking is limited by the recast, nothing
else.
Shaman.. well I could slap another dot on, but then I get into agro
problems.  I could sit him more, but im lazy. Besides, a canni 5 every few
mins and his mana is good anyway.
Rogue.. well he's not optimal thats for sure, but he is a late addition to
my grouping (hes only been elemental flagged a month or so). 85% of his DPS
is better than no extra DPS though, thats for sure.
