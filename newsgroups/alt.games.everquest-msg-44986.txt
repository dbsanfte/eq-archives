Hmmm, well I suppose it depends on how much pp you have, when I played an
enchanter I was using an Ice Crystal Staff, it didnt hit for much but proc'd
in the late teens so wasn't bad for a caster. They aren't worth more than
25-30pp I think (on Prexus anyway). A staff of writhing might be worth
getting, as far as staffs go it's probably the best I've used so far, hit in
the mid to high teens around that level (I am using a bard not a pure caster
though) and proc's a nice 45dd in the later 20's which made a _huge_
difference for me over the course of a fight.
