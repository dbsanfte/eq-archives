Nah, between the pathing changes (undead hang out near the shore a
lot more now) and that loud sucking sound emanating from Paludal,
Oasis has become better than ever for soloing.  It never was all
that good for grouping, pre-Kunark it was way overcrowded and after
Kunark came out the morons who were to stupid to figure out how to
get to LOIO all stayed in Oasis KSing each other.

Once again, the massive popularity of Paludal has created an
opportunity in the "old" popular haunts.  LOIO is decent all the
way to 30, and no longer crowded.  Likewise SK on Antonica. At 30
you've got a ton of choices and only the zones with very limited
action (HHK, Paw entrance) seem to get overcrowded.
