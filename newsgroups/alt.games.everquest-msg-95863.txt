Hmm, do you have dual-channel IDE controller?  If so, you might want
to put it on the second channel.  Also, if you have access to a
multimeter, I would check that the power you are supplying to the CD
drive is good (5 VDC I think) and steady.

When it fails what is the failure mode?  Does it stop working totally?
Spin up but have errors reading off of the disc?  Spin up but totally
unable to read?  Does it work with audio CDs?
