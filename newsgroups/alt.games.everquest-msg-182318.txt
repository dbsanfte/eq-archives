You've already figured out the problem. It's lag. Lag increases with the
number of things that your machine has to process in your visual field.
These "things" include players, which are the most memory intensive
since they have to be constantly updated in real time. (As opposed to
structures, walls, etc.) The bazaar is insane for lag. You just need to
have the best machine you can and do all the normal lag reduction tricks
to move around well there. 

Turn down your visual clipping plane (under options) to 5%. You can also
hide corpses, shut off all player names, and a few other things. But
mostly shutting your clipping plane down to nearly nothing will allow
you to move more freely.

Just remember to turn it back up a bit before you go hunting. You'll
only be able to see about ten feet away and that can be dangerous in mob
country. :-)
