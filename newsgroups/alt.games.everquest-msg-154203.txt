Yeah, I celebrate the death of children. Also, every Sunday I get my
sociopath friends and run around kicking orphans and puppies for fun.

So let me get this straight. It's okay for me to talk about irradiating
adults but when I talk about some dumb kid killing himself with a toy I'm
all of a sudden some monster? Makes sense to me...

Talk about a double standard.

I don't think life has a meaning, anyhow. You're born and then you die.
Everything you do in between generally involves passing your genes and
crushing everyone else in your way to superiority.

As for my opinions having more weight than others, I've said that no one's
opinion ever really matters more than your own. So of course I'll be biased.
