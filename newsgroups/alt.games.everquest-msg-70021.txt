     You'll have to wait in line to do it.
Xytl has more enemies than Dorn.  Not that
I'm trying to disuade you.  Indeed, I would
ask that you kick him once, or four times, 
for Teashot who got repeatly murdered by him
about an hour before that patch a few months
back where Verant repeately warned not to 
leave corpses lying about, because they 
might go poof.  I don't usually sweat in game
deaths, but that night I was stressed.  
   On second thought, kick a hundred times
for me, won't you?
