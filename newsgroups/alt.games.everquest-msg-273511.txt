	Hmmmm well I played for a while in 199? when it first appeared
and quit in frustration over long stretches of doing nothing but getting
to a place to do something, not to mention that I expected more role
playing ala' my D&D experiences but didn't see much.

	I came back in 2003 to the same lack of RP but a much more
convenient game.  Heck, if I wanted to take hour long boat trips I'd
install EQ: Boat Adventures. :-)

	One man's immersion is another man's why bother I guess.
