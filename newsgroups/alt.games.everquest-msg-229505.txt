Where's the PoK book in EC?

Butcherblock?  Halas?  :)

At low levels the exp is good, the points are pointless.  Loot is hit or
miss, but usually decent at any level from what I've seen.

At low levels, assuming pickup groups, you'll want to avoid rescues just due
to the more complex nature of them.  If you're in an obvious group of
supertwinks, you can ignore that advice since everybody should be able to
follow a map (and have a map) and grasp the concept of what has to be done. 

In my experience the collection missions suck.  They sucked before they were
"fixed" and they suck just as badly now.  Nothing like collecting the first
19 of 20 items in 20 minutes, and then running out of time, and then running
out of second-chance time, searching for the 20th.

Slaughters are the most straightforward and thus easiest.  If you have a
good enchanter/bard and a tracker, I find the assassinates are good for loot
farming as usually 2 or 3 mini-named will spawn.
