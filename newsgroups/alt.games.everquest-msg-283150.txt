It is, mine still shows correct time.  Seems some people found if they
completely logged out of EQ, did a complete file check, and then
re-logged in the time gets fixed.  Not sure why since the account time
is server side not client side.

Also check and make sure your PC has the corrent date, time, and time
zones as incorrect time have messed up some things with EQ.

/petition if yours still shows bad time.
