INT casters and priests are on the same damage tables it seems, and neither
class has a damage bonus. The minimum hit is simply DMG/10 (minimum of 1),
whereas the maximum possible hit is a bit more complex...

From experiments on my shaman, I've found the following maximum hits:

Dathor Great Hammer, 74 DMG/ 95 Delay, 310.
Hammer of Spiritcalling, 39/43, 163.
Aleje's Ceremonial Cudgel, 40/38, 168.
Spear of Fate, 20/30, 84.

Further, I've seen a cleric friend hit for a max of 84 with his epic
(20/32), and an enchanter hit for 105 with a Wand of Tranquility (25/30).

Dividing the maximum hit by the damage for the above weapons gives:

4.189, 4.179, 4.2, 4.2, 4.2 and 4.2 respectively.

Therefore, the absolute max hit for priests and INT casters seems to be
roughly 4.2*DMG, although with a Tipt bracer priests can deliver critical
hits for twice those values.

As a final note, the max hit is tied in with ATK - with an ATK in the 800s,
the cleric didn't once manage to hit for 84, yet with Ferine Avatar pushing
his ATK into the low 1000s, he hit for 84 several times. I *think* the
"magic number" for ATK is in the 900s somewhere for priests and INT casters,
above that you'll not see a rise in the maximum hit, just an increase in its
frequency.

I also remember reading that for hybrids and melees, the equivalent is 1280
ATK or so, below that you'll not see the maximum potential hit from a
weapon. As my hybrid alt struggles to reach 1100 ATK at the moment, I can't
verify that one :)

(For reference, the shaman's Magelo is:

and I no longer have that Dathor hammer - it was just *too* slow to be worth
using).
