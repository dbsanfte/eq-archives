I think I have a solution for this.  Find yourself a guid that is on giant
faction.  Go to them and say "Hi, I need 10 fur from velium hounds in WW,
but only CoV faction mobs are up.  If you get me the 10 fur, then I'll spawn
the Dain for you to kill when I turn in the armor"

You get your fur without hurting CoV faction, and they get a shot at and
extra Dain spawning in exchange for killing stuff in WW.

Win / Win situation.
