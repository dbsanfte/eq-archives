It's not quite that dramatic a reduction, but yes, this is pretty much it.
(As I understand it.  I haven't experimented with charm personally) Omens
mobs didn't get scaled up damagewise from the GoD mobs, thier gains seem to
be more in hit points and length of fight, so they're not actually hitting
for 2k.  More like quad 900's in Murramite proving grounds, the hardest zone
I've been to yet.     Of course this doesn't count the named, some of which
can hit for 2k... but those sure as hell better be uncharmable no matter
what.

But in any case, that quad 900 mob once charmed, will hit for quad 200'ish
or 300'ish instead.   Still well ahead of a non-charmed pet, but not in the
"lone pet outdamages an entire group" range.

I haven't seen the suggestion you mentioned, but it does seem to be one of
the more reasonable.   It would need tweaks to keep any kind of a "charm and
release" kill strategy from being effective, (perhaps have the damage
reduction only active on the person who charmed it) but that could be
balanced.   Another option would be to simply reduce the enormous hate
generated by charm, (but only on the charm spell that produces nerfed pets)
so that it can be easily pulled off the enchanter once the spell is over.

As I said, enchanters do have some legitimate gripes right now.   KEI whores
are one of them.  That for 20 - 50 pp, a group can get one of the major
benefits of grouping with an enchanter without actually bringing the
enchanter with them, is pretty bad.

It's not an easy problem to fix though, as long lasting buffs are necessary
for raiding.   One obvious step would be to cut the duration of KEI and put
it in line with the later mana regeneration spells, clarity 4 to 6.    About
two hours fully extended, instead of four hours.   This wouldn't eliminate
the problem, as two hours of mana regen is still long enough that
significant hunting can get done before needing an enchanter to refresh the
spell, but it would be less ridiculous than the current situation.



As for the other big arguments of the thread, while they may not be the most
pleased with the effects on the new enchanter epic, it seems to me to be in
line with what all the other classes got on thier epic 1.5.

The spell turn in list is another legitimate complaint.  Mez should not be
the last level 69 spell they recieve, more like the first.  (Although the
"and therefore the new mez should be vendor purchased" variation of the
argument is not legitimate in the same way.)
