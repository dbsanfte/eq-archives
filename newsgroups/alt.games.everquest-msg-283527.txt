I'm going to be forming a guild with 5 RL friends that are coming back to EQ 
for this server (and 1 that never left). If all the people on this forum are 
interested, it might be possible to merge my interest with that of this 
whole group: unless the chatter of non-AGE people would be unwelcome, I 
don't see why everyone here couldn't join my guild. Besides, I could use 
help thinking up a name =P


I'm not making this suggestion flippantly - AGE contains raiders and 
socializers, and my guild will be a balance of the two. I don't expect ever 
to be a "top guild" (people who are assholes will receive a boot to the 
behind) and I don't expect to see twidling thumbs (people who never get past 
level 9 won't slow down the guild), so it's safe to say that the great 
majority (to the point where I can't even think of the exceptions presently) 
of those conversant here would be an asset to a guild on Combine.

I would expect the only hitches in this plan to be if (one) the AGE guild on 
Combine was meant to exclude non-AGE persons ... which seems like a poor 
idea, but if that were the consensus then it'd be silly to argue ... or if 
(two) this crowd had a problem with the power structure of the guild, which 
at this point is simply an oligarchy where the most appropriate person for a 
job takes over. For example, when the time comes to do _____, the person 
with the most experience who is willing to lead will do so.

Coincidentally, the 5 people with me joined during the years 2000, 2001, 
2002, 2003, and 2005. It's like they're my veteran rewards. You'd like them.

I'll make another post about this, a more formal one, a few days before the 
server is scheduled to open.
