Well, you are correct...  Everyone cares about equal rights..  I guess
I should have quantified that by saying that Acceptance is more
important to the homosexual lifestyle'ers then equal rights...

I would disagree with you on the equal rights issue.. By and large
those in the homosexual lifestyle DO have equal rights..  That their
rights are abused is true.. However, on the whole, there are others
whose rights are abused.  White, black, red, green etc etc etc..  So I
guess it's more accurate to say that those in the homosexual lifestyle
are not singled out for abuse any more then any other group. In that
respect, they ARE equal...

That's a given...  Would that it could that everyone felt that way...
