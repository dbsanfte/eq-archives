I also wonder why some folks are so fond of "prayer requests",
like "my brother is in the hospital, everyone please pray for him."
I'm not sure how they expect that to be more "convincing" to God
than one personal prayer.

And then there are the Catholics who pray to Mary, so that she
can help "convince" God to intercede.

Maybe if He just set up an email address at which we could reach him...
