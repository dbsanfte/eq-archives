Ok I'm a little late on the answering part (original post last friday).

As 21st level mage I can say that there are almost no quests you can do that
will provide you with a decent reward. Some faction, yes. Some cash and exp,
yes. Really cool stuff or a lot of cash, no.

Here's a couple that I've done and one I've just heard of:
Greater Lightstones
Gossimer Robe in CrushBone
Golden Ear Stud (Quebert)

I've pretty much made up my own quests by figuring out what I want and how
to get it: 1) replacing cloth armor with raw silk 2) getting a better
looking robe 3) making enough plat to buy a stein of moggok and other +int
items.

I'm at the point now where I *should* be working on the mage focus items but
VI raised the price of admission in Najena to beating a L30 something
skeleton. Grumble... grumble...
