As I remember, the problem with XP was a number of fields that default the
wrong way...yeah, that's right, a big part of it is Universal PnP (not the
hardware PnP, I guess this is network PnP). Anyway, it leaves a port open
that CANNOT be closed unless you COMPLETELY disable UPnP. The only fix is a
firewall. I don't think the XP firewall blocked it, but I could be wrong.
I should poke around more on that grc.com site and see if I can find it.
