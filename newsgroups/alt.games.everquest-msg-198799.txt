Bass-Ackwards thinking... Poll the account.  Much faster than polling the
servers.  They can at least check active chars easily.  Can they see others?
I don't know.  Probably not, as they would be tied to the server slot.  So
they could at least check active chars to see if there was a wis caster/int
caster/melee/hybrid, etc. that fit whatever criteria they decide was
appropriate.  Is it worth the effort?  Maybe.  Sure would make a lot of
people on test much happier.
