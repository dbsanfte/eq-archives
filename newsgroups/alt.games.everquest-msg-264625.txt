 From a lot of comments dropped when I was still paying attention, I'm 
of the opinion that part of the problem with SWG is beaurucratic <sp>. 
Specifically every time they want to change something, they have to work 
up some code to see what it would look like, then hand it to Lucasarts 
to approve or deny

Wookie armor for example. They said sometime in beta they would like 
some light Wookie armor, but LA wouldn't let them have it. Finally LA 
allowed them to have some wookie ponchos and gloves and stuff. Then, 
after Lucas supposedly decided to put wookies wearing armor in the third 
movie, they were able to get permission to add armor, but they have to 
do an artists drawing, send it to LA, wait for them to appove that, then 
do the 3d work, then send that to LA, and wait for it to get appoved.
