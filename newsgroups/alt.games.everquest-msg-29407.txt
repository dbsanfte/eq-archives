>The staff of temperate flux says it's primary/secondary but it won't go into
>the secondary slot.  Is this a bug, or is it not really primary/secondary?

OK, listen up, here's the full poop on SOTF:

Its a weapon, which means it has a damage and delay.  That it says
secondary slot is a bug.  You cna put it in your primary slot and use
it as a weapon if you want to, but it has terrible sats so 99.99999 of
wizards will never do that.  

You then say, 'bah, this is useless to me then, even if it does have a
very nice debuff...'   But the SECRET to SOTF is YOU DONT HAVE TO
WIELD IT TO USE ITS EFFECT.

Thats right grasshoppers, keep your flux staff in its own inventory
slot and then target and right click any time you want to debuff
something.  You can even make a hotkey for it, and you dont have to
right click the hotkey, you left click it (or use its keyboard
equivalent, I have mine set on slot zero of page 1 of hotkeys)

So then you say 'Bah, its useless to me if I have to give a bag up to
lug this arround', to which I ask you are you a Wizard or a packrat?
We blow stuff up and thats all we do.  Anything that helps us blow
stuff up better is #1 and #2 and #3 priority for us.  Go buy some 10
slotters and dont worry about it.

I got my flux staff mid 20s and have used it on evey mob I've fought
so far to 54.  Its only a few points debuff?  So what, its FREE debuff
and stacks with many other debuffs and is a fantastic pulling tool.
Any Wizard that doesnt keep his staff ready to rock and roll all the
time is not at full efficiency, in a class that is already way behind
efficiency wise.
