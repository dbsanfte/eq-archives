ok, since this thread started down this path, i have created a new tank,
erud sk (was messing in warrens/SM and wanted to check some erud sk only
quests), now 7th level

str 80, stam 75, agil 75, dex 75, wis 83, int 117, cha 75
no twinking,

1hb 35, 1hs 35, 2hs 35, (2hb trained up to about 12 not showing in my
parser), alchohol tolerance 3, bash 8, bind wounds 35,  defense 31,  offense
35 (maxed), (piercing trained to 4 not showing in my parser), sense heading
40 (maxed)
been mashing the taunt key every fight and still not one single point in
taunt according to my log parser

me thinks he is getting the green line (in my color scheme) saying he is
taunting, get that every time a smack the dang key, but i still haven't
gotten a SKILL INCREASE message, and is till bet he hasn't either
