Doesn't matter what the refresh is on it...unless you wipe like every 15
mins on a raid?

You need it NOW when the shit hits the fan, not in 10-15 mins (if you could
forsee danger wouldnt you rather just avoid it?)

Good old Divine Aura has a cast time, at raid level your going to be hit for
several hundred at a time, stunned like mad etc.. all that means DA can/will
be interrupted.

Compare that to new improved DA, not only is it instant cast so you can
always cast it in the middle of a shitfest, its also targetable, meaning you
can cast DA upon somebody else.

Every cleric in my guild with bestow DA loves it.  Have you got it yet
James(or going to)?
