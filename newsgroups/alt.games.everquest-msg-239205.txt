> Various Tips and Tricks....

This has been one of my favorite resources and I've got it printed out right
by my side at all times. There are a couple of things I've wanted to point
out and now is a good opportunity.

Here's something that caught my attention:

> /ttell. Targeted tell. Useful for sending a tell to the owner of a
> corpse. Works for the living too

It seems to me that this above section is meant to be associated with the
following section:

> Once you remember to use it (you can use it on corpses) it's amazing.
> Ever talk to someone with a horribly complicated name to spell at a
> glance? Target them and /tt.

This last section appears all by itself and is kinda stranded without
context. Almost like it was orphaned from its parent above.

A more glaring example of this kind of orphaning seems to be occurring
below. Here's the first part:

> How to drag multiple corpses:
> Make a hotkey(s) with the following:
> /corpse <name1>
> /pause 2
> /corpse <name2>
> /pause 2

What you have following this, is the section on how to make hotkeys, and
later you pick up with what I believe was intended to be the continuation of
the above:

> etc for as many corpses as you need. You will need to move slowly, but
> you will be able to summon multiple corpses along as one giant pile.

Read through it and see if you don't agree. Maybe I'm just reading it wrong.

Another tip I added to my own copy of this file is how to add more than one
line of /say or /shout to a hotkey. Ordinarily if you just put multiple /say
commands in a hotkey, only the first one will get executed. However, a
hotkey that looks like this:

/pause 3, /auction Look what I've got for sale today:
/pause 3, /auction This
/pause 3, /auction That
/pause 3, /auction and the other Thing!

works and all 4 lines display.

Thanks again for pulling all this together, it's a great contribution to the
community!
