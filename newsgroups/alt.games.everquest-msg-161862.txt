Not sure if anyone here can answer this question... but I might as well ask.

 I'm playing a lvl 20 Vah Shir beastlord, and I'm (guessing) about halfway
through my newbie (battleclaws) quest.  I was told not too long ago by
another beastlord that to complete the quest you'll have to get help from
all the other Vah Shir classes -- these are, if I'm not mistaken, Shammy,
Bard, Rogue, and Warrior -- since there are certain items you can only get
as a member of another class.  Now, I assumed when I heard this that I would
be notified when this was the case, especially since I didn't see anything
about this on any of the spoiler sites (allakhazam, eq caster's realm, eq
traders, etc.).

However, a few days ago I reached the part of my quest where I need to get
two sonic pup molars and give them to Kaam Rahiir, and as yet I haven't been
able to get a sonic pup to drop one... then yet another beastlord came to me
complaining that Sony had 'rigged the quest' so that the pups drop molars
only for warriors and not for beastlords... Now, I immediately guessed that
this was one of those parts in the quest where I need help from another
class, but I had written down what the past few NPCs had told me and not one
had mentioned getting another class to help.  So now I'm thinking that he
might have been mistaken and they do in fact drop for beastlords, since I
can't imagine that Sony would do something like that and just leave us to
wander around blindly until someone took pity on us and explained the
situation to us (would they?).  My question is:  do I need a warrior to get
these molars for me, and if so, then where else do I need someone else's
help that Sony didn't see fit to tell me about?
