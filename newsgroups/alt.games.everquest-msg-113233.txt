My shaman is asked for sow, sometimes quite rudely, every single time I
play, usually multiple times.  Most of the time I sow people, sometimes I'm
too busy, and I don't, sometimes I just ignore people who ask.  I have been
asked to PL quite a few times by complete strangers as well.  I also get
buffs demanded from me, those people I don't bother to answer, much less
buff.
