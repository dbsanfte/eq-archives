Wow! Horrible story. Crappy situation. Conflicted resolution. I wasn't
even aware that Ragefire was fixed yet. (Still haven't heard of a
confirmed Skyfire kill on our server yet.)

I guess the only question in your resolution is over the way you
referred to the cleric who had been legitimately [1] camping Ragefire as
"a friend". How good of a friend?  Obviously not a guildie, or it
wouldn't be a question, but I know many of us have friends that are as
close, or closer, than some guildmates, but just happen to be in
different guilds. Or was he more of "just an acquaintence" type of
friend who you'd met/hunted with before? 

I mean, at that level of the game, nobody is going to be enough of a
fucking dweeb to invoke PNP and call a guide. (Well, you'd HOPE not
anyway). The guy had been there for a long time, so my first impression
was that if he was "a friend" you'd just hang back (which you did) and
let him have it (which you didn't.)  And yes, you only took it when it
became obvious that several other guilds were massing forces to jump his
camp, and he's not pissed off. So did you do the right thing? Who knows?
On the one hand, one could say that all you did was turn into the "first
camp jumper" to beat out all the other camp jumpers. On the other hand,
I guess it could be argued that your friend was probably taking
consolation in the fact that if *somebody* had to jump his epic camp, at
least it was a guildmate of a friend and not some stranger.

I guess in a world of nothing but fluffy bunnies and flowers, the
"right" thing to do would have been to kill it and let him loot the
heart. But given the rarity of the spawn, and how much it means to the
clerics and their guilds, I can also see how you'd have to say you were
FIF so you could take it before somebody else got the required numbers
there to jump it.

[1] All this, of course, is based on a presumption that the epic capable
guilds across the servers (of which we finally just became one. Yay for
us!) are going to agree that the "new and improved" Ragefire is campable
at all.  Or is it going to be FIF? Or just plain old FFA? All bullshit
PNP stuff aside, I think that's a decision that the guilds are going to
have to make. Might even vary from server to server.

(Yes, I know that answered none of your question or conflict. Just some
observations.)
