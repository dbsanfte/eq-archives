Well I was finally able to download this large long awaited patch with the
new UI and all the extras,its taken me a few days with my slow connection,
but when I get to the login screen I get a 1017 error. Has anyone else had
this problem after the patch? And if so how did you fix the problem?

Will look forward to your reply's

Cheers
