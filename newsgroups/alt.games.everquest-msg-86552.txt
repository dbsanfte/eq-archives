Ive never actually xp'd in steam font, so I dont know if this is a better
suggestion... butcherblock.
Any level 5 wood elf/high elf ive ever played has spent level 5 in
butcherblock.
The snakes, large spiders and skunks are easy hunting, and spawn right near
the GF zone.
Later on you can start hunting dwarf skeletons and giant scarabs. There are
4 spawn points near the druid ring (SW of zone) that can be single pulled
(dwarf skeletons), 3 at the undead tower (2 are so close you will double
pull), and one behind a tomb sw of druid ring. If noone else is hunting them
you have more spawns than you have mana. Enjoy.
