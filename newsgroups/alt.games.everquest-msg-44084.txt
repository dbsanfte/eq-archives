   Just curious how many here beta test to combat EQ burn out. I first beta
tested AC, then Jump Gate (Just finished beta testing), and now
Elemental-Saga and A Tale in the Desert. I'm signed up for three more. It
gives me a break from EQ and lets me see what's new with out having to pay
*g*. I don't think I'd quite EQ anytime soon, I just have to many friends
that still play and I still haven't reached 60 yet. By the way I first
played EQ as a better tester, I got in at the very end though, wish I could
have tested from day one *g*.
