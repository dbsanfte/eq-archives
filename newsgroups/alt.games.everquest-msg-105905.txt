  In a stupid sort of way it makes sense.  "Low charisma means you look
ugly, means you look scary", it's stupid, but if you're stupid, it makes
perfect sense.  Lots of necromancer and shadow knight items lower charisma,
so somebody probably thought "hey, this must mean it's a good thing for
necromancers and shadow knights."
