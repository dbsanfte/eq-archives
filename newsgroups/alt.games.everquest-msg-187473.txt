But since titles are a no-no then it is banable. If I can't name a
character " Dios" or "Senor" why should you be allowed to name yours
goddess in Japanese even if it's a true name. It's like trying to name
a toon " Jesus" , it's a common name but just try to used it.

Hmmm...a frog named  "Senor Frogs"
