yeah same thing happened to me at karnors. I zoned but didn't zone. I could
see everyone on the dl side running around and on my side (suppose to be kc)
there was no one and where the doorway was, it was bricked up. I walked back
to the zone line and rezoned into dl then back to kc and it was fine hehe
