That depends on where you are hunting. There are lots and lots on Wisp Island in
Erud's Crossing and they are pretty plentiful in West Commons (at least on Xev.)

You don't know any tailors, do you?

Hardly. I can usually take a hundred plat to the EC tunnel and walk away in an
hour with 5 or 6, stopping only because I've run out of money.

Again, you don't know any tailors, do you?

LQ bear can be made in to a tailored large bag, 6 slots, 10% weight reduction
and weighing only 0.8 stone. I have auctioned these off to monks for upwards of
5pp (yeah, tailored backpacks have 10 slots, but they weigh 3 stone and what
monk is going to want to carry that many things anyway?)

My main tailor is now making reinforced armor. That takes HQ skins and can be
sold for 1pp per AC. Gloves with 5AC, tunics with 11AC... you get the idea (she
won't make large reinforced though; backpacks are just to profitable.)
Reinforced leather and tailored quivers (which need a HQ cat) are pretty much
the only way to bring tailoring skills without using the hard to get crystaline
silk or attempting the almost impossible to make Velious items.

If nothing else, two words: Leather padding. You can make it from LQ skins (or
better skins tanned down to LQ) and they are REQUIRED for making any kind of
smithed plate. I recently sold two full stacks of padding to a smith for 30pp
each (or 1.5pp per padding), mostly made from LQ skins I bought for a few silver
each off merchants.
