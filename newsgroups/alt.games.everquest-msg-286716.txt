I'd say that's a bit of an oversimplification.

Crying, "Rage against the dying of the light!" or William Wallace riding 
back and forth before his troops giving the same, "They'll never take our 
freedom!" speech loses it's effectiveness by the 375th time it's offered. 
The message is no less noble or correct, but it becomes little more than a 
self-serving diatribe at some point. If it's therapeutic for Lance, then 
good for him, but I can't really fault people for being a bit baffled by 
his frequent revisiting/rehashing of the subject.
