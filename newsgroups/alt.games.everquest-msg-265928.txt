Uh... so they brought their usage of the word with them. Well.. then 
they're using the word in CoH outside of your/Cryptics defintion aren't 
they? a "healthy dose" of them no less? (Surely a "healthy dose" is more 
than .1% of .5%)

That's like the third time you've proven my case for me. Not sure why 
you keep arguing it.

If it annoys then its a 'problem' regardless of what the rules say. If 
its harrassment. a punishable offense, to do it more than a couple times 
then the devs think its a problem too.

So what? I never said otherwise.

No. I'm telling you that the playerbase gets to decide what 
"killstealing" means, not me, not you, not the devs, and not the 
mechanics. There is ample evidence that the playerbase's usage of the 
word exceeds the dev's definition of it.

Its pretty easy to make people say stupid things when you get to put the 
words in their mouth isn't it?
