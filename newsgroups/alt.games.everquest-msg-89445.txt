Here's a surefire test:  Does he have his level 30 spells scribed
in his spellbook?

If so, then he really was level 30+ way back when.  If not,
then it's almost certain Offer is misremembering, since it's
*highly* unlikely he would have worked his Paladin up to 33
without ever bothering to get any of his level 30 spells.

And there's no way to "unscribe" spells, either by accident
or intentionally, plus they stay in the spellbook even
if you "de-level".
