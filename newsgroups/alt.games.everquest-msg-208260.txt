Set up a chat channel... Then turn off the ability to see group speak and
spam away the group chanel.  If you have something important to say, say it
in the chat cannel (languages don't matter there).

: getting cloth and stuff for my shaman friend seemed more
: interesting, and Crushbone has always been one of my favorite

Yes and No on the quest loot.  Lightstones and GLS are a real boon for
sub-14 chars (they are trivial soon after that and will start going poof).
Also, I've seen some of the magic-tagged quest items sell in the bazaar, not
fast, though.  Remember, twinks are in fewer quantities on FV with only 1
char per account, so newbie stuff can still be valuable into the late teens
or early 20s (my 31 DE Enchanter still wears the legs as I haven't had a
chance to upgrade them, and the gloves just got replaced recently).   Best
is still the tradeskill items, though prices are a little lower than the
regular servers.
