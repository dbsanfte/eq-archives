I am not a provisioner, so, it's actually more annoying for me, as I have 
to actually pay a fair amount of cash for those provisions.  I still have 
no issues with it, I do explore a lot, and try out mobs to see if I can 
take them, and yet, I am just not bothered by this.  You always have the 
option of swapping changing your food and drink before you die, or if you 
know you are trying something stupidly reckless.
