From the shadows, the mysterious wrat@fnord.io.com (the wharf rat) (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

Test does not catch everything, especially things that deal with
cutting edge new issues (like GoD) or those dealing with server load
(Test has a max online population probably around 750 or so).

No that really is quite accurate in describing your argument.

Obviously, eh? How come you can't provide any evidence for it then?
Other than the circular argument claiming the downtime IS the evidence
for it....

Your argument is actually thus: since according to Wharf Rat's Book of
Acceptable Downtime they are doing too much, obviously there CAN'T
have been some kind of major problem related to the very recent
release of a major expansion, it MUST be because they are trying to
cut costs, and if they are trying to cut costs, they MUST be out to
screw the players!

Please come back when you have a shred of evidence the reasons for
dropping the server weren't time-critical, mmkay?

Oh so not only are you making the argument that without any evidence
to support it at all the reason for the downtime is cut costs, but you
also make the contradictory argument that they don't actually cut
costs at all?

Ooh this fiendish corporations, always out to get you in the strangest
ways possible!
