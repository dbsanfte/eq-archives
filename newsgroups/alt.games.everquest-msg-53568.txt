Reminds me of the time a kiting druid trained me(a ranger) with a
mummy(blue to me) and got PO'd when I killed it.  Undead aggro on
nearest, I was nearest, so it jumped on me.  I didn't even
notice(particularly) the status of the person who dumped it off on my,
and was mildly pissed that my(spider hunting in Nro) was being disrupted
by a mummy/disease.  So I was going to get the XP.  When I reminded the
person of the unique properties of undead, they apologized for training
me, and for complaining that I "stole their kill"
