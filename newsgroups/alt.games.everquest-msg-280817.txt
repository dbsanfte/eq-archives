Which god are you on about?  I wouldn't really worry about it.  If you
play the game long enough and get into a raiding guild then you can
kill most of them so they won't be able to send you anywhere when you
die.  On the othe hand - if you do try to kill the gods and you aren't
up to the task then they will certainly punish you for it.  Maybe you
should play the game and just leave the gods well alone.
