There are some things that they could do in the old zones that
wouldn't require examining the old content, line by line.  For
example, in WoW NPCs that have a quest for you have a clearly visibile
mark on them, and NPCs that you need to talk to to complete a quest
also have a visible mark, and show up on your mini-map with a dot. 

It's been long enough since I've played EQ that I can't even remember
if EQ has a mini-map, but certainly they have enough infoirmation to
mark the quest NPCs, and that would be a generic change that would
apply to old and new content alike.
