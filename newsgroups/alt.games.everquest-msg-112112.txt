|    Depending on what they're casting, about that. Draughts are three
|seconds. Point being they miss that tick of medding, more often than not.

	Sniff.

|    BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Let's look at some simple numbers for a typical
|situation - single targets, mezzed mobs so no rain for better efficiency,
|enchanter only. Between 51 and 59, your average wizard is going to be
|casting Draught of Something-or-other. You're looking at about 700 damage
|for 215 mana. At max med rate he's getting back 25 mana per tick. C2 is
|another 11 mana per tick. So that's 36 mana per tick, or six ticks (36
|seconds) to recover fully. Assuming no resists, that's a *sustainable* DPS
|of about 19.5 damage per second.

	700 damage in three seconds is 233 DPS, give or take.

	"Sustainable" is irrelevant.  They don't have to sustain it.  That's not
their job.

|    Would you like to post your ranger's DPS with AQ on, Dennis? I bet you
|have that beat quite nicely. And that's with your misses - I didn't assume
|ANY resists, remember?

	I parsed last night's log (brief foray into SG followed by a long grind in
Akheva) with Pasketti's, and between 1H slash with the epics and Kick it
claims 70 DPS.  That was with Wondrous Rapidity and/or whatever a 60 Bard uses
for haste these days (though I don't think she has Warcry of the Vah Shir
yet), for the bulk of the night.  And it's not counting Call of Fire procs and
the occasional Calefaction and Immolation (blue Centis are immune to movement
changes so I had to blast them for agro -- I was MT in Akheva).

	What's your point?  You and the Wizards are just arguing that big things
are less efficient than little ones.  Duh, welcome to the real world.  On the
basis of "efficiency" the USS New Jersey's main guns don't hold a candle to a
typical handgun -- meaning what?  You going to conduct shore bombardments with
handguns now?

	If a Wizard wants my DPS, he's going to have to deal his damage the same
way I do -- at arm's length, in tiny little pieces instead of big booms, and
with two other classes (haster, healer) backing him up.  And ONLY that way.
They can't BOTH deal high constant AND instantaneous DPS.

|that add to his DPS), and many other variables. Trust me, they wanted
|nothing more than to prove they were worth it in a pickup group. And they
|couldn't.

	No, they don't want to prove they're worth it in pickup groups.  They want
to prove that they're not, so they can ask for improvements.

|    The most expensive spell I see you casting on a regular basis would be
|something like Calefaction, which costs 15% more mana than a Draught and
|which is FAR from your only damage contribution to the group. All the wizard
|offers is his nukes and his ports.

	I cast constantly in combat -- Jolts, snares, refreshing buffs.  So do the
other hybrid classes.  Hybrids can't function in high-intensity grind groups
without Clarity.

|    So you're offered proof, and decline it based on what, exactly?

	Experience.  When someone waves a mathematical argument (which is not ever
"proof") in your face that does not match your own experiences, the odds are
that they're either wrong or outright lying.  The argument that Wizards do not
pull their weight in experience groups does not match my experiences.  I have
never regretted having a Wizard in my group.

|    Wizards don't think they're weak - far from it.

	Maybe not, but they want others to think they are.  If you want to ask for
more power, you have to play down your strengths and draw attention to your
weaknesses -- however insignificant they are.

|    WRONG. Higher DPS lets you clear an area faster, not "I nuked some of
|them out, now I med while you fight with a five man crew." Wizards are good
|at dropping that one mob that has to die, but they are poor at long-term
|damage output.

	You don't need them for long-term damage output.

|    There's a world of difference between being a fair to strong damage
|dealer like most melee classes are, and which usually also bring something
|else to the table (buffs, heals, tanking ability), and a weak damage dealer
|when it comes time to decide who to add to that random group in a random
|zone. 

	And since Wizards aren't weak, they don't have a problem.

|Judging by my guild's wizards, it isn't a fun profession if you like being
|social.

	Thanks to pinhead who still think it's June 2000 and Kunark just came out,
neither is my class.
