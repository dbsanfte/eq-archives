And I thought you'd be talking about hotkey'd phrases some folk would
use.... like:
"Hello.  My name is Inigo Montoya.  You killed my father.  Prepare to die."
...that they might spam at every six-fingered mob they come across.

The examples you used as unnecessary, I would find useful for at least some
of the party members to hear, depending on the situation.
