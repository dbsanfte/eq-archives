He wasn't necessarily being a smart ass. I think the point Graeme was 
making was that you will find, if you're not already aware, a greater 
level of disdain from others toward a halfling druid even compared to 
druids of other classes. The reason for this is the fact that it is quite 
possibly the very easiest combo in the game and is therefore played by a 
great many players who are either a) lacking of any semblance of clue 
where EQ tactics and general gameplay are concerned, or b) have zero 
social skills and therefore require a character capable of soloing more 
often than not without the typical downside.

If, knowing this, you still opt for a halfling druid, then my hat comes 
off to you for going against the wave of popular opinion.
