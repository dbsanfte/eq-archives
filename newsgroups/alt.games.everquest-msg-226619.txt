I have Tiru, 55 cleric to Brell.

I didn't like any of the female dwarves. They just don't look like what 
I think proper dwarves should look like.

And it was fun to play him as an old flirt, making eyes at the ladies. 
Jak kept refering to me as his wife, so most people caught on quickly 
that I was a harmless flirt.

I did notice the wood elf always got more abuse than any other race. The 
barbarian got some. While the dark elf was pretty, not many folks tried 
to hit on her. While folks will pick on the gnome, nobody actually acts 
like they want her for a "girlfriend."
