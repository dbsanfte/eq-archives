I got a barb warrior and I started bind wound from the start, (easier to
solo).
My wis is only 70 but by lvl 34 my bind wound was maxed out at 175, which is
as high as it will go til lvl 50. Wis is pretty useless for a War except for
trade skills, but then u could make a high wis char and use that one for
trade skills and just transfer to the war if you need, such as making armor.
