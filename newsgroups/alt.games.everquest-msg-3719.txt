As Dan mentioned, this might be due to the fact that you're playing
a race that is SUPPOSED to be mostly night-blind (unless you get
a light source to carry with you, and even then it can be
murky).

But it might also be your video card, I had problems like that
with my own card.

To diagnose it for sure, go back to your boyfriend's computer, and
bring up your new character on his computer (it's easy, just use
your own login information instead of his -- any EQ character can
be played from any EQ-installed computer, as long as you possess
the login information).

If you're still blind at night, it's your character's limitations.
If you can see a hell of a lot better on his computer than on your
own, then it's your video card.

Even if it's your video card's fault, try this before you blow money
on a new one, it may be a software issue and not a hardware issue:

    1. Make sure you have DirectX 7.0a (downloadable from
       many places, including www.microsoft.com) installed on
       your computer (or even 8.0), and not an older version.  Try
       running dxdiag.exe (in your \WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory).  If it
       reports an older version, or you don't even have
       dxdiag.exe at all, you'll need to upgrade your DirectX.

   2.  AFTER you've updated your DirectX (or after you verified
       you have a new enough version already), go to the website
       of the company that manufactured your video card, and download
       the very latest drivers available for it.  Most cards have
       newly released drivers, which support the new video "special effects"
       of the kind that EQ uses a lot.  I even got a brand new
       "fresh from the store" video card once that wouldn't work well
       with EQ until I downloaded the very latest drivers from the
       manufacturer's website the same day that I bought the card...
       Even in the short time that had elapsed between the time the
       card was boxed at the factory, and the time I bought it at
       the store, newer drivers had been released.
