Actually, I think the opposite is true.  New players enjoy the game
"as-is"...it's the experienced players who want to start new characters who
are most likely to be annoyed at the low-end game.  New players think
fighting bats that drop a bat wing for them is amazing.  Experienced players
who are re-visiting the low-end game again are the ones who need to be
entertained.  The fact that they nerf weapons so that high level characters
can't twink low level chars is further proof.  Verant has always frowned on
twinking.  If Verant were aiming these changes are new players (who don't
have high level chars yet), there would be no need to nerf twinking.  They
are nerfing twinking because they expect existing (high-level) players will
want to start new characters to check out the new low-end game.
