Check out Hostdime.Com.  I just bought one of their plans.  They have some
really cheap plans for $1 or $2 a month (I don't think the cheap ones
support DB's, so be careful of them if you need one).  I have their standard
plan for $4 / month.  It includes 75MB of storage and includes up to 10mySQL
databases.  I also think they can do domain registration for $15.
