With Righteousness, SCHW, and SOS on, your damn straight I miss
med tics.  On the other hand, my calculations as to damage output
were based on no haste at all, and the Cudgel has a 38 delay, I'm
more than capable of catching almost every med tic. In fact, if I decide
mana is more important than melee, then I catch ALL med tics, by
virtue of watching the mana bar and standing to swing after each tic.
This turns all weapons into unhasted 60 delay implements, though,
so suddenly the damage component alone is worth considering.

A) I don't miss much mana
B) we've already concluded that the idea that all cleric melee
damage is paltry compared to cleric nuking damage is a
chimera; unhasted its at about 2/3rds the nuke damage... and
I wear SCHW always, and have SOS quite often.  Its entirely
possible I do more damage meleeing than I would nuking, over
a long period of time with constant pulls.

Too bad there are so few undead mobs out there, cleric damage to
mana ratio isn't bad at all on them.  You can pull the same stunt using
Reckoning, but now your damage level suffers a bit.  You are also
competing with another group, here, not for maximal efficiency in
terms of mobs per hour.

If I need to kill something right now, its clear that burning thru
mana as fast as possible is the answer, I can spend 10 minutes
afterwards medding back to full.  THis is part of the overwhelming
power of a wizard, not that they have a great damage to mana
ratio (sure, they do) but that they can dump it all so very quickly,
giving the mob less time to respond.
