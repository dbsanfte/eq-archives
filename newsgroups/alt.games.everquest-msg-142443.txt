Flip-side:  I hear a song I like somewhere, I hit kazaa to find more songs
by the artist (extend this to a preview feature on a hypothetical legit
site) and like them all, I go to CD Japan, and order all three of Hikaru
Utada's albums.  Rinse.  Repeat.

What would happen of a few big-named artists got together to make a
web-based media company?  How much damage do you think names like Sting,
Carlos Santana, Travis Tritt, Allison Krauss, or any other big musical act
could do to the RIAA?  I don't know a country station that wouldn't play a
new Garth Brooks track, regardless of whether or not it came from
RIAA-approved studios, as long as it was legit.

See above.

And then there are younger singers who get taken for a ride by their record
label.  Or those who are damn talented, but not the "sound" that a boy-band
obsessed producer is looking for.  Nah, they have no use at all for an
alternative means of distribution.

I don't know if it would be more merit-based then it is now, but I doubt it
could be worse.
