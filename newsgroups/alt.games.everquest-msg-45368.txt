Former two, you mean. Bard faction is raised with the letter
deliveries and killing in Mistmoore, I think...

And to the top posted follow up: My main handed in shark meat for
hometown faction to see if I could turn warmly to merchants. I got
bored and gave a backpack of meat to my then level 3 gnome mage. Level
3 mage dinged 7 as the pack emptied, is allied to warrior guild and
amiable to Felwithe and Kelethin merchants. Also, there was one
Kelethin merchant that conned indifferent to my druid, and he turned
amiable as I handed in meat. I figured I was 4 backpacks short of
conning warmly to the merchants with my druid, judging from my mage's
faction changes, and decided I couldn't be bothered. The quest NPC was
removed the day before I recreated my wood elf warrior, so she is not
allied with her own guild :) (Maybe one day I'll farm shark meat and
take her back 'home' to work on that faction...)

Anyway, if the quest doesn't raise merchant faction for dark elves,
it's a racial thing since it works fine for wood elves and gnomes.
Also, IIRC the quest messes up indigo brotherhood faction.
