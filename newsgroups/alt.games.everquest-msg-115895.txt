Hi:

I know this has probably been asked before, but please, can someone tell me
how I can cancel my Legends account and return to my old server? From what I
can gather I cancel Legends from the options screen when logging in to
EverQuest, is that all I need to do? Will my character be automatically
switched back to my old server or will he remain in limbo on Stormhammer in
case I want to re-subscribe?

Can someone that has already returned to their old server let me know how
they did it? I have no Legends only type loot, I don't have wads of cash (5K
in the bank) - I just want to leave Legends as the service is in no way
worth the money I pay for it ..

One final question, I want to make an alternative character, if I do, will
this character be moved back to my old server with my main, or must I
petition a move? It might not be worth my while to make my alt yet if it
can't be moved ..

Thanks you as always, safe hunting to you all ...

Stevie (Stormhammer)
