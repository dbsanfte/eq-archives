<my 2 cents>

$75 seems pretty outrageously expensive to me.  That's almost 1/2 year
of EQ subscription.  I'm guessing it'd take less than 10 minutes for
someone to perform the transfer -- and that's if they're taking their
time.

My *guess* is they charge so much to prevent *too much* swapping around
of characters; i.e., the price isn't necessarily based on their effort,
but also as a discouragement.
