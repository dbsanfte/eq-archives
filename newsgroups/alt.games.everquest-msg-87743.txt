    Crystal Caverns apparently has content that can take you to 50, but
which is difficult to single pull. It has vendors. I have yet to go there
and adventure.

    The first floor of Dalnir will be light blue, with a fair number of
greens and possibly the rare dark blue. The second floor will be the same,
with a few more dark blue mobs. The third floor has a good split of dark
blue and light blue mobs, and has some fair areas to pull to. The problem is
getting to the third floor, getting set up on the third floor with pet etc.,
and once there getting out with loot to find a vendor (nearest vendors that
aren't Iksar-aligned are in OT). My level 40 Iksar Monk was just there last
night getting half of his Shackle of Steel quest drops, so all the /cons are
personally verified.

    If these are your only two choices, go CC.

    James
