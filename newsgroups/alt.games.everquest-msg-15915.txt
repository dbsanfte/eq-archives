I've played EQ since the beginning and my son plays as well.  Two EQ nuts in
the family is bad enough, but.......
My son showed my grandmother (his great-grandmother) how to create a
character and play a ranger.  Now, not only am I sharing game time with my
son, I have to allow granny to have her turn at it when she visits.

She's 74 years old, that's got to be a record. It's hilarious having my son
translate "dood" language to her when she encounters it.

What a great game.  People from their teens (some younger) to their 70's can
enjoy it.
