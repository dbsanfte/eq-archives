My wood elf druid is level 44.  She really has no need for sneak / hide.  Go
invisible to med.  Port out, sell your junk, port back.  She plays alone
99.995% of the time and I *love* the solitude once in a while.  She doesn't
have to depend on anyone else to sow or port her.  Of course she can't hit for
crap, but she doesn't have to.  
Upon occasion she buffs and sows people who are nearby, but generally she plays
in empty areas.  It's really a great way to release stress after a long
day.....
