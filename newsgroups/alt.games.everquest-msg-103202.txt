}Off the top of my head... I'd guess The Safehouse (Rogue site... I've never
}played a rogue so don't know the site) might have some general faction tips
}(getting a rogue to 'indiff' to buy/sell shouldn't be that much different to
}getting a 'dark' race to non-KoS status)

Stand behind merchant.  Press the Sneak button.  Sell/do quest. (actually, 
I'm not sure exactly how it works, but I'm told something like that is 
very effective for rogues. :) ) There is still some faction raising 
information on that site, but I didn't see much that wasn't on allakhazam.

}Any Necro/SK specific site might be worth a look

Iksar monks and shammies end up needing major faction improvement to do 
their epics...  I vaguely remember seeing a page or two about that 
somewhere.
