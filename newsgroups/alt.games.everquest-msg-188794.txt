Luclin is a good expansion as you get the bazaar(which is the best bit) and
the ability to port up to the moon then port down to most of the continents
without having to be a wizard or a druid.Now the Plains of Power will allow
you (much like Luclin )port to the Plane of Knowledge then back to just
about anywhere you want to go,but you won't be able to hunt on any of the
plane as you will need to be, I believe, 45th level.
So to sum up. I'd buy Luclin,but unless you feel $30 is worth being able to
port on your own ,I'd save Planes of power for a later purchase.

Now for web sites here are a few to get started with:

For all your map needs
http://www.eqatlas.com/

For general info
http://www.everlore.com/

And for a good list of quests and general info
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/

Good luck and good hunting.
