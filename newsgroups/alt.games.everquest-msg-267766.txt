Actually, you might be in a good position. How old are your kids? Are
they smart enough to XP grind you while you're at work or sleeping? Do
you have enough to rotate them on your character 24/7? Sometimes I

don't want to level you voluntarily, pay them a couple bucks for each
level until they get hooked.
