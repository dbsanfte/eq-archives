In Mario Kart 64, it seemed like the computer players were paced to you.

When playing player vs player, when you hit your opponent with a turtle
shell, they would spin out, have to reaccelerate and catch up.

You'd hit computer player with a turtle shell or whatnot, but they'd be
right back on your ass again in a matter of a few seconds.

It seems that Everquest is the same way.

Example. You see an mob that cons blue. You snare it, run a safe distance
ahead, cast, repeat. But when it catches up to you, it will hit you 3 (And
it seems like it is always 3 times) times for the max amount of damage it
can. When this happens, it has caught up (You and the mob have the same
percentage of hp left.).

Unless you are twinked or super buffed anyway.
