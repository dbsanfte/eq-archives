The levelchart is nice, but watch out for overkill raids. The chart is based
on groups of those levels, not multiple-group raids.
I myself have witnessed a "raid" of 12 people between 20 and 30 totally
owning SolA which is rated till up to lvl 45. Lower Guk a week later wasn't
much of a succes because most camps were already taken and then there isn't
much to do. SolB on the other hand was a wipe whenever a 3rd mob appeared.

It's really hard to raid at those levels because of aggro and the way
dungeons /zones at those levels are designed, ie for single-groups. Plus the
fact that the niceer zones are usually camped by slightly higher people for
loot or exp. Sure you can have fun, but expect overkills and quick boredom
(sorry).
