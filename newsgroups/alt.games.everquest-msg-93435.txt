You can definitely raise faction with Seru by killing the thought leechs in
mons letalis. So you don't have to do quests.

[Fri Feb 22 21:50:59 2002] You have slain A Thought Leech!
[Fri Feb 22 21:50:59 2002] Your faction standing with Thought Leeches could not possibly
get any worse.
[Fri Feb 22 21:50:59 2002] Your faction standing with Seru got better.
[Fri Feb 22 21:50:59 2002] Your faction standing with Hand of Seru got better.
[Fri Feb 22 21:50:59 2002] Your faction standing with Eye of Seru got better.
[Fri Feb 22 21:51:00 2002] Your faction standing with Heart of Seru got better.
[Fri Feb 22 21:51:00 2002] Your faction standing with Shoulders of Seru got better.
[Fri Feb 22 21:51:00 2002] Your faction standing with Citizens of Seru got better.
[Fri Feb 22 21:51:00 2002] Your faction standing with The Recuso got worse.
[Fri Feb 22 21:51:00 2002] You gain party experience!!
