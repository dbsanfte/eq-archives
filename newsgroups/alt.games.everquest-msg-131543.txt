For drivers in general, maybe.  But in my experience, for Nvidia drivers, 
I've had much better luck with whichever driver they currently have listed 
on the luclin compatibility site than whatever the latest and greatest is.

The other usual recommended course of action is, if it ain't broke, don't 
fix it. :)
