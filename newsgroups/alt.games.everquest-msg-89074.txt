I must say I did hold some respect for guides and gm's
for the crap that they have to put up with.
I do so no longer.
Anyone remember last weeks emergency maintenance and
LD general instability on Tuesday?
Well I happened to be doing the dark elf corruptor
in EK for my druid epic, as i was going to spawn the
corruptor next, my team wasnt ready yet. I held off and
went LD. I could not log back in to complete it.

I wasn't worried, thinking that I could simply continue
at a later time, not knowing that each step spawned the
next druid before corruptor.

I re-assembled the team for last night. Looked everywhere
for Teloa, then was told that you must do all 4 at the same 
time.

I petitioned, expecting that due to this being SOE's fault
that they should spawn my mob for me, as I did have the 
piece needed.

Got a guide first. Said that lost or poofed quest mobs could
not be respawned. I explained that it happend due to network
issues at their end. He said he didn't know about network
issues. Didn't know? WTF! Are these guys trained to deny
everything? They pulled all servers down for emergency maintenance
for damn sake.

So I moved onto the Senior guide. He said the exact same thing, and
claimed he didn't know about the network problems. He also stated
that all quests are done at the players risk, and it stated
that way in the reimbursements section. I said it says no such
thing.

At this time he suggested I speak to the server GM, who just
"happened" to have yesterday off, but not ot hold my breath, as
in the 2 years he's been a guide, has NEVER seen a mob spawned
for ANYONE, even if it was their fault.

At this point I logged out in disgust. I mean really pissed
off. I know I wasn't deep into the epic, but dammit that is my
time they just wasted, and I'm the only one who can put
a value on it.

So this morning I logged on and got lucky. I am pretty much
back to where I was. BUT I was lucky. My rare spawn happened
to pop on the third of 4th ph kill.

If I didn't like this game so much, I would called em and cancelled 
on the spot and started a drug habit. Same difference.

Cheers,
