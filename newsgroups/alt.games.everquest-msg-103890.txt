Fine. Allow me to make you hate me even more :p

Corrupted hill giant: Was running alt through RM and /ooc'ed if anyone
had seen tainted recently, was told some shaman was killing the
corrupted now. Ran druid to RM but item rotted, camped and proceeded
with alt for a short while, was told tainted was up again, logged in
druid and looted piece after a bard killed tainted and corrupted.
Corrupted aquagoblin shaman: camped an hour and half with a cleric one
night. Went back another night, killed one PH, saw a stray corrupted
shaman pet on track and went to the zone wall and killed that, went
back and found tainted was up, got corrupted.
Corrupted mammoth: went to EF once and it was camped. Went another
night, it was uncamped and the tainted was up.
Corrupted brownie: camped 1 hour and the tainted popped.
Corrupted seafury cyclops: went to OoT with two friends after killing
brownie, and the tainted was already up. By the time we'd killed
corrupted, another tainted was up.
Corrupted seahorse: spawned after 1 hour in KK last night (chaining
this to guildie if he didn't get one after I went to bed, he was only
missing Faydedar and seahorse)
Corrupted gorilla: a few guildies were sitting around EJ waiting for
Sev to show (he didn't) and randomly killing stuff. The tainted
spawned, they killed him and the corrupted and called me in to loot.

Batmen-on-twinkies never did me any favors; Tzirathk did.
