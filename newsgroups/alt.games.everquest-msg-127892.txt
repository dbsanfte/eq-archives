I haven't read all posts in the thread (I may not get around to it) but so
far I haven't seen anyone.  Ken Crippen vouched for the guy, and that
carries weight with me so I'll likely try it tonight, but I haven't seen a
regular poster coder decompile the downloadable exe to verify it matches the
source on his site and then post it here.  *shrug* then again, what's the
worst that'd happen to me?  Reformat...big deal.  It's not like I keep
important info on the computer I'd be running this on.
