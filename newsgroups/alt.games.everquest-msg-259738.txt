Heh, I agree and I know what you mean. CoH tried to take a different 
approach and I did find it refreshing not having to worry about managing 
inventory and pursuing the elusive "stuff", but in the end I think I missed 
the thrill of being rewarded with stuff.  I think most of my disenchantment 
with loot resulted from my EverQuest experience, where about 95% of the 
items I looted were of no value to me and were just vendor fodder so that I 
could actually get what I wanted from the Bazaar. When I started raiding 
with a bigtime raiding guild that started to change, of course, but it was 
still pretty attenuated because I wasn't actually killing much of anything 
(the raid was) and I never looted any of it (I played on FV where there was 
very little NODROP so there were looting officers). I'd put in my name for 
an item, and if I was lucky and deserving, I'd get awarded the item. It was 
only slightly different than buying it on the bazaar or getting a gift from 
a friend. Very sub-optimal risk/reward program from my perspective. Diablo 
is a much better example of using items and loot as immediate gratification 
for risk taking.

This game appears to be pretty loot intensive, so I would imagine so, but 
I'm not the best person to ask. Lots of folks have been playing this for 
some time and the non-beta forums are open to the public.  In-depth 
questions are probably best answered there.

My sense is that there's going to be plenty of "stuff" in this game. I'm 
constantly having to sell because I'm encumbered by all the loot I wind up 
grabbing from mobs, and some of it's actually been useful. My Paladin is 
already outfitted almost completely in Chain, and has sold lots of leather 
and cloth. There are plenty of unused equipment slots on me still, too, like 
jewelry etc.
