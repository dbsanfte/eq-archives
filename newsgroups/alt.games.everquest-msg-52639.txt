Recenetly I've been playing a cleric, currently high teens.

For some reason seem to be running into more "idiots" in the game than I
used to, possibly because I am hunting in different areas than before, or I
have run into one person with a number of characters in the same area.

3 times now I have had players higher level than me (2-4 levels higher) try
to duel me, mainly because I wouldn't heal/buf them when I was burning mana
on my group (and these guys where all solo).  For some reason they all
seemed to think if I am the only cleric in the zone, then I should be
healing/buffing anyone who wanders by.

If I have spare mana, then I am happy to heal/buf.   If you are really low
on HP and being attacked, I will try to my best to heal you a bit, or at
least root the mob so you can run.  If you are happy to sit and wait for me
to treat you, then by all means I will do my best to help you.

But these twits abused me in /tell that I was not being friendly.   And then
they try to duel me!   2-4 levels higher than me.  One was a necro, others
warrirors.   I declined.  don't like PvP, if I did was on a PvP server.

But thinking about it, could I have beaten at least the warriors?   Strategy
would have to be something like this:


1.  Bind somewhere close, but where the opponent doesn't know where I am.
Also safe enough to med.

2.  Let the fight begin

3.  Root him    Hope  like hell it works

4.  DD spells until Low mana

5.  Gate to med spot

6.  Med

7. Repeat until idiot dead

Would that work?  any better ideas?   and the Bind/Gate steps seem "unfair"
to me, and not really nice play  (sort of like training a Necros pet to
nearby guards so the kill it in PvP)

Any thoughts?


Thanks
