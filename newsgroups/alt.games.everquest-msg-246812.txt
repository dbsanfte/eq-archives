Well, interesting, but inadequate.  They claim 85Hz is sufficient but 
provide no direct justification for that number.  They only cite one 
experiment, which compared 120Hz and 32000Hz.  Two datapoints ain't much.

And worse, it's from a monitor company, a source that has a lot to gain in 
selling the idea that higher refresh rates are better.

85Hz is a reasonable sounding number.  But I would like to see the 
justification for it.  And I would like to know:  is 85Hz the point at 
which flicker is never perceived for 90% of the population?  99%? 99.999%?
How does the curve look?  I'm personally probably in the less-bothered 
than average part of the population, as I do have at least one known 
uncorrected vision defect.
