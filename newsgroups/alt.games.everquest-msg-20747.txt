"Not Without My Daughter" is the film version of a real-life
story, about a woman who married an Iranian-American, and they
had a daughter.  They go to visit his family in Iran for a short
while, and the husband, influenced by the fundamentalist culture
and his own friends and family there, declares that they will
stay in Iran permanently and begins to get more
domineering and forcing her into a "submissive wife" role.
She decided that she needed to leave him and go back to
America, at which point she learned that in Iran at the
time (perhaps still today, I don't know) the father has
all the say-so over the children, and she would NOT be
able to take their daughter out of the country with her --
in fact, even the wife has no "right" to leave the country.
The rest of the film depicts her struggles to get herself
and her daughter out of the country and back to America.
