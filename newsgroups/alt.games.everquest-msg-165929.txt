Never wiped to anything else in PoG except Ail first time we fought
him (the WTF factor, Bard technique not used, collective arses handed
out) and once since then when it was early on a Saturday and I think
they pretty much had every post 46 twink up their hoovering loot while
clearing.

We 0wned (bleh) "old" ST for about six weeks with the new version
coming in towards the end of that.  Due to luck with patches etc we
hardly gave any of the non Euro guilds a chance in that time and the
uber/wannabe uberguilds on the server had long since forgotten about
ST to farm Luclin.

I can certainly remember two or three occasions when clearing "old" ST
yielded no Primal at all (or 1 Brawlstick from 3 named, thanks RNG) so
it was certainly nicer to see a few more drops in the new version.

Boosts your chances yes, doesn't make it trivial though.  I'm pretty
sure the MT wasn't 65 for example.

No, I class Vyemm as the antithesis of a CH mob.

By pre-PoP I meant with everyone capped at level 60 and pre-PoP
spells, I estimate we could have done AoW about 5-6 weeks earlier than
we did (ie before PoP) but the opportunity didn't present itself.
Obviously we would have needed about 2-3 more groups (certainly a few
more Clerics) to compensate and I'm not sure we would have dropped him
first attempt even then.
