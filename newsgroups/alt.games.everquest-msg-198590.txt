> Hard for SOE to do anything about this though.

I asked about gambling from SOE GM's etc before I even started running a
game.  As long as its on the up and up, your okay.  That is why my games on
Bristlebane are always on the up and up, and I often return money that is
due to me because of some complaint because I don't wanna risk hassles and
trouble with GM's unless its obvious to me that things were done fairly and
honestly.  The game I run has the odds in my ( houses ) favor, and over time
I expect to always come out ahead running the gambling game.   I have had
nights though when I was like 20 K or 30 K down.  Usually though the big
winners wanna keep on gambling to win even more, and I do okay in the long
run.

If your cheating someone, it can be a bannable offense.  SOE has limited
their involvement some by warning you to always get a fair exchange for
trades, so some GM's might not do anything.  You should always check the rep
of the person or people running gambling games, as often their is some cheat
or something going on, so rep is something to always check if your laying
down serious plat.  Its possible to go LD at any given time, but usually you
can expect the person back in half hour or so if they are trying to get back
online.  I've gone LD before in middle of a roll, but always came back to
complete things satisfactory to all participants.  Some other people are
just scamming though.

Things to keep you safer from scams if you wanna gamble is to check their
rep, like I said before, and see if they have the plat to really pay you off
if you win.  My char has like 495 K + plat, so I can afford to pay out 20 or
30 K plat and not worry about it.  If someone ended up winning 200 or 400 K
plat, I would pay that out also.  My min and max bets are 100 plat to 20 K
plat though, so chances aren't good for someone to win that much plat
overall.   If the person running the game doesn't have min and max bets,
then they probably are trying to scam.
