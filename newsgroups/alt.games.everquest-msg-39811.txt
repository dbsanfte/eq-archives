As far as I know that is correct, although I couldn't prove it either :).

Of course, the level of a mob isn't the only factor in how difficult it is
to kill, and therefore how easy it is to get exp from hunting them.

Well, the ShowEQ guys say the maximum exp you can get from a single kill is
10% of that required to level, but the effect is pretty much the same (L13
mob = 2197xp * zone modifier * class modifier, exp to level L10-L11 is
~290-300K, depending on class).

When did Verant state that? Do you have a link to someplace they said it?
Just curious.
