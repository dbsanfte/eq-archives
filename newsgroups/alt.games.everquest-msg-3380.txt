I had that problem with a high elf wizard of mine.  I found myself always
getting into groups that would hunt the monsters around Steamfont.  I got
sick of medding and always sitting on my butt so I created a barb. warr.
(was always short on tanks in the groups I played in, so I made one).
Anyways I really got into the Everfrost region & Black Burrow.  I fell in
love with Black Burrow, and as I earned higher levels I got more freedom to
explore the dungeon without getting mobbed.  So to cut to the chase I would
suggest finding a dungeon appropriate for the lvl of the char you want to
use & make it your home away from home.  It was always pretty easy to get a
group in Black Burrow.  Actually to this day I prefer hunting in a dungeon
than out in a zone.  Maybe I'm just weird.

I also tried picking up a trade skill.  It gives you something else to do
besides hunt all the time.
