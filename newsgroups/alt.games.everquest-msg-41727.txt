I was in a CoV faction group last night in Great Divide.
We had a level 60 paladin, a level 59 cleric, 53 druid, 54 wizard, 56 shaman
and a 52 wizard.

We were fighting alongside a 60 rogue. She was not grouped with us, as there
was no room. A Frost Giant Elite was pulled - blue to me, so I was a bit
excited at the prospect of getting a bit of experience, since everything else
we were killing was green.

The single, ungrouped rogue got the kill.
