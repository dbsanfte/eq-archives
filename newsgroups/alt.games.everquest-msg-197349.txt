Please. Explain to me where I have the facts wrong. I understand it is a 
major pain to make it through the trials. I understand why. I understand 
the sequence of events necessary. I also understand that not everyone 
currently making it through them is doing so only through some divine 
intervention of 5 godly-equipped players.

Give me an example of something of which I'm unaware beyond the

No, not everyone. Some, but not everyone. I have already stated my 
agreement that there are problems with the current system that should be 
fixed. That said, there are people getting flagged all the time as it is.

Yes, I do have a decent idea. Have I been there? No. Does that mean I 
have no idea? No. It's not like giving birth or something. I can 
understand it to some degree - enough to formulate a valid opinion.

I don't know where you got your math skills, but if even 5% of the people 
trying get flagged, that's 5% of some 40 attempts a day currently, 
factoring in any likely downtime and transitions. Well, that would be 
some 12 people per day, give or take. Now if things were such that it 
took half the time to go through it, then some 24 people could be flagged 
per day. Therefore, yes, more people could be flagged.

Nice propeller head analogy, but it doesn't apply here. I *am* qualified 
to comment on it. Where's your degree in astronomy or astrophysics? Are 
you even qualified to *make* that analogy?

If a guild has any members flagged, then they have members who can level 
up more to be a big help to others. If they are unwilling to help others, 
then that does not speak well of the guild. Again, let me repeat, you 
don't have to devote the majority of your playing time to getting others 
flagged to be doing your part. No one should expect that, but you should 
be helping. I'm hearing a lot of talk about people who get flagged and 
then take off on their levelling spree with a disregard to helping others 
in the guild get flagged.

How large a guild are we talking about having the problem? As I also 
stated before, I don't feel there is any problem with requiring a decent 
guild support network to advance at some point.

Unless you concentrated on levelling up to a point where you *would* be 
an asset. That would of course be part of the equation.

I'll concede that that was surely an advantage. However, by the same 
token, couldn't today's guilds obtain the same gear?

Do you have some sort of mental block to my statement that the 
requirements on a flagged person's time should be reasonable? You want to 
be able to get everyone flagged in a couple week's time. It turns out 
it's more of a trickle process than that. That would be the downside. The 
upside is that as each flagged person continues to level afterward, they 
become a greater asset to getting others flagged. I'm starting to repeat 
myself here.

"Massive" "proof"? What I've seen out of you and just a couple others in 
that regard is talk about why small guilds are having trouble. Let me 
focus on the heart of my opinion:

1. Placing this type of requirement on the higher level content is not a 
bad thing. It adds something that breaks up the tedium of the levelling 
process.

2. The current solution should be fixed, not removed.

3. Guilds should be comprised of members who are willing to offer a 
reasonable amount of their time to help guildmates pass the trials after 
they do themselves. That's where loyalty and cohesion come in.

If you are a small guild and your members aren't high enough level to 
attempt the trials, level up some more. If your guild lacks the equipment 
to attempt the trials, work hard on obtaining what you need. If your 
guild members won't offer any of their time after getting flagged to help 
others, find some who will.

It *should* be harder for smaller guilds to do this than the larger ones. 
I maintain that whereas it is more difficult, it is still possible. Do 
you feel that it is impossible?
