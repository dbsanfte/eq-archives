Oops, got Cursed and Arch-Lich confused.  It's been a long time since my

Actually, we were the ones that killed the final trigger, and we killed more
than 50% of the triggers.  We had a head start on the triggers, and the
rival guild only started killing triggers when they saw what we were up to
and wanted to get in our way.

But that's ancient history at this point.  Like you said, the GM likely
would not have been able to rule in our favor unless he had been there to
observe the order of events.  And perhaps not even then.

I will maintain to my dying day that our primary intention was to get
Blood's loot - we didn't want to leave Emp room empty-handed.

However, I will be honest enough to say that our officers may have also been
thinking about using the extra four hours to ensure we had a full raid force
in our battle with the rival guild towards Emp.  But that was still a
secondary consideration.

I do think, though, that it was Customer Service nightmares like this that
persuaded SOE not to have contested loot-dropping triggers any more.  =)

Perhaps.  But also keep in mind that one of the rival's guilds intentions in
racing us to every Emp spawn was to keep us from Vex Thal.  They were mostly
beyond Emp's loot table, having farmed Vex Thal for months by that point.
They just wanted to keep VT for themselves.  We saw the same behavior from
them later, when they suddenly became very interested in contesting every
Coirnav spawn after we killed TRC.  And after we killed Coirnav, they just
as suddenly lost all interest in him.

You can see, then, that when it comes to contested spawns, we don't put a
lot of faith in the rival guild's "sporting" nature.

> Yeah it was pretty infamous on the FoH boards too.

Seethur, yeah.  He later got kicked out of the guild for ebaying a guild
BoC.  Not one person on either side of the aisle shed a tear when he
subsequently quit EQ altogether.  =)

I think we're just going to have to agree to disagree on this point, Martin.
If it's "technically" a scripted event, then it's a scripted event, and it
is just plain wrong to interfere with it, no matter what rationalizations
you use.  In this, we have the GM's on our side.  And I have no problems for
petitioning folks for breaking the rules of good behavior as SOE defines
them.

Oh, I didn't know that, actually.  That would explain their behavior a bit
better.  Doesn't excuse it, but at least I know why they were so impatient
now.

> Allowed? Why the hell not.

Because the GM's will punish them.  =)

Hehe, yup.  One of the reason I still despise their guild is that they have
the most vocally obnoxious people on the server.  Including one of the guild
leaders.

Gawds, yes.  I was sooo glad when they removed that Ragefire bottleneck - I
was so not looking forward to a week-long camp.

And I'm encouraged by your reports of how unpleasant Txevu is.  One can only
hope that this will keep the rival guild from racing us to every spawn.  But
I don't hold out a high hope.  If only this zone could be instanced, too.

Me too.   =)  In the past, every time we have offered a rotation on a
contested mob, the rival guild has rejected it.  Only when a GM stepped in
would the other guild agree to a rotation.

But the neck only offered a bonus on group direct heals - a spell I seldom
cast.  Nothing spells instant cleric death like Word of Redemption.

However, I did in fact find myself casting WoR and other group heals a bit
during Inktu'ta, and perhaps I'll find a need for more group direct heals in
Txevu and beyond.  So perhaps I would have found myself missing the healing
bonus in the raids to come.

Your other points remain valid, that this BP is really only a minor upgrade.

Just a few, but we only need strong root at the very beginning - after that,
the mage pets take over.

It is my understanding that the primary and secondary tanks get banished
once or twice after a reset before the mage pets re-engage and re-root and
the SK can go back to getting distant aggro.

Again, I could be completely wrong about all this. =)  But that was how I
interpreted the raid instructions we were being given.  I think the SK's do
get summoned but they back right out, and if they get banished they rush
back in and quickly grab aggro again.

Mage pets keep re-applying root.  I didn't know they proc'd root *that*
much, but I do know that a week or so ago our last mage had to leave the
raid before we got to Noq, prompting the raid leaders to call off the raid
altogether as their whole strategy revolved around mage earth pets.
