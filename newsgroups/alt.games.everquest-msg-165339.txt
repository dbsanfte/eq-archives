I don't know about FV but I would assume someone auctioning to buy a cleric
summoned hammer actually wanted to buy the spell scroll and not the actual

If we could actually sell our summons could you imagine how pissed magicians
"the masters of summoning" would be. They've been trying for years to summon
stuff good enough to sell.
