How many guys did you have for AoW?

We've been talking about trying the AoW, since Statue became a trivial
fight, and Velketor was like fighting one of Tormax's guards (2 deaths on a
vindi try - tashicide, and puller rampage agro - and statue pulled before
arena even repopped, and flawless kill)

Did your puller get wasted btw?  One thing I've increasingly noticed
recently, whichever monk pulls Vindi is perma on his rampage list, even
without hitting him once and after several FD's.. depending on clerics, only
the tank ch rotation groups have them (as Vindi is a pure MA fight) so the
monk just gets pwnt fast..  /cheer VI for never properly fixing FD, and
ruining it with SoL

What did AoW drop?
