Yup, this works great too.  For the original poster, since you're new to
research you may not know this, but mages also use Words (different one...I
don't THINK they share any), and enchanters use PAGES, though many LOOK like
Words when you loot them.

Just to round it off, wizards use runes...the only one that's obvious unless
you go up around Grimling (where some rune-looking stuff drops...I don't
know what those are for).
