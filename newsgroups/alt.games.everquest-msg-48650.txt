 It's not that hard. Unless you're lazy. Trak drops 4-5 teeth at once so
you don't even have to kill him that much. Did I say it was much better?
However, for those people who can't get into VP, allowing those who can
to get scales that way does alleviate the bottleneck for those who
can't, does it not? It's not a hard concept to understand.

 For most people the epic is more than just a weapon. It's a sign that
they, and their guild, got them something that means something to them.
It's all about achieving something not whether or not Weapon A
outdamages Weapon B. I guess that's just too 'uber' a concept for some
people.
