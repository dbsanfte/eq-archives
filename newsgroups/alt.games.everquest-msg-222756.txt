A point I'll concede, that is unless the product remained the superior 
choice. Cisco, anyone?

Works fine for me. I realize full well I have the option of other 
browsers, yet I *choose* IE. Funny that.

Typical end-users want functionality *and* features. Try to talk 'em out 
of using all the nifty pop up greetings, special emotes and such and 
you'll see what I mean. Are you saying it should not allow the eye candy 
that so many users *do* want?

Maybe something they could look into. I'm sure they have. It's an awful 
big one to leave out there for no reason.

*Every* OS has it's faults. It's still better than anything else out 
there for what the majority of people need it.

Now if you'd like to explore the benefits and useful features, this might 
actually turn into an objective representation.

Yeah, ok, so? That's on the company. I don't care if those who refuse to 
keep up stay in business.  (?)

You're starting to reach now. We're talking about the best, most 
accessible OS available, making constant improvements in a self-promoting 
manner. It's getting better all the time. No other OS compares. Mac comes 
close, from what I understand, but if it were truly better, I'd be one of 
the first to switch. It's not. It's also hardly similar to making an 
automobile that doesn't fit on roads. FYI, the military model of the 
Hummer fit the roads just fine, and that's as big as they got. It's not 
like the fact that they are wider than a normal sedan really swayed many 
people's decisions on buying one.

The fact that Windows is the better OS overall is why they enjoy the huge 
market share, not some monopolistic conspiracy. If everyone was forced to 
do things the same way, you might see a higher average quality of 
product, but the best would not be as good.
