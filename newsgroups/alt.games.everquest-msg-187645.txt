I use WinXP and I have never had any problems running any of the games I 
have. I have had absolutly no trouble running EQ at all. In fact of all the 
online games I play (AC2, DAoC, EQ, MOHAA, Half Life, QuakeII/III, 
AO...etc...) they all run fantasticlly.

I can only put it down to the fact that I know what I am doing with it as 
an operating system....... perhaps you need some help? :D

Btw for those of you who are fairly computer literate WineX will now run EQ 
in Linux.. WOOT!!
