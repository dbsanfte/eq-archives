The variety of responces the original poster has gotten to this has been
staggering, I must say. But to cut to the chase, I really think you're
approaching this the wrong way. If you run around, not intending to group and
fight, and simply sit in dangerous zones advertising rezzing for cash, yes, I
think people will look at you as a greedy asshole.
   I've also never seen the only rez capable clerics that I play with ever
"charge" somebody for a rez.  However, knowing the value of the cleric's time,
most people come up to ask for a rez already offering to pay a donation and drag
the corpse there to save time and trouble for the cleric.  I would guesstimate
that the typical donation seems to run about 50 plat for a 39 cleric rez if they
have that much on them.  I've also seen these same clerics do it for less, or
free, if the person simply doens't have the cash. (Or at least claims not to.)
  Now the interesting part, and the reason I'm piggybacking on this particular
post, is Biz's response to this. I find that very odd. It seems to me that, at
least in this forum, the druids are the *first* to bitch about people wanting
free SoW and buffs all the time, not being willing to pay, etc.  SoW and buffs
are certainly nice, but a rez is giving you back some or most of the *HOURS*
that you spent gaining that xp. And since the cleric generally throws in a big
heal to counteract the rez effects, as well as a couple buffs in some cases,
you've effectively wiped out their mana pool for a while.  How anybody can think
of a cleric expecting some plat for a service like that to be out of line is
beyond me.
Quote "How much is my exp worth to me? Not enough to pay money to a smartass for
a rez."
In my experience, I'd say you're in the distinct minority. Most people seem
*glad* to offer up some cash for a rez.

That said, I'll also note that the cleric I group with doesn't take any money
for rezzing from group mates or guildies.  We're only talking about random
strangers who come looking for a rez from the only clerics in the zone.
