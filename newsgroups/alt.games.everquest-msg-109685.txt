Well, I'm afraid American Heretage and Webster disagree with you
there. -YOUR- definition is all fine and good, but that doesn't change
the -REAL- definition of the word:

v. intr.
1. To act dishonestly; practice fraud. 
2. To violate rules deliberately, as in a game: was accused of
cheating at cards.

If you're not playing by the predefined rules of the game, you're not
playing the game. Plain and simple. Once you start making up your own
rules, you're playing a different game. As such, don't piss and moan
if you find your ass kicked out the door.
