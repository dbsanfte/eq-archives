Just got this spell and was suprised when I cast it on my tanks when they
asked for pure Haste instead-(Aanyas Quickening for me). Obviously the two
don't stack otherwise this wouldn't be an issue.

Who will want this spell cast on them, and why does it not appeal more than
a spell I got a couple of levels ago?

Any answers/ideas appreciated.

MaC
