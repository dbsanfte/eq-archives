I don't think I ever mentioned this here, but long ago when
I was hunting in Iceclad, I noticed something funny about the
gnome pirates.

Of course they don't function as guards, you can drag the
mobs of the island thru them any which way and they won't
even blink.

But, root a cougar next to them and back off, and sometimes
you can get a fight.  Had a mob KS'd from me by a pirate
that way, was =very= surprised.

Question is, are they guards but extremely slow to react?  Or
are the -mobs- attacking them when out of better prey to hit?
