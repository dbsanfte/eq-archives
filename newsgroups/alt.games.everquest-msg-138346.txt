Dude! - I got guys picking me up all the time after work! They pick
me up to the bars, out to eat, shoot pool, etc., etc,   How in gods
name do you deduce "gay" from driving off with another male ?  
Your not by some chance talking about "swapin spit", or groping

But thats not the point. (but you know this )

I dunno 'bout that - talk to mother nature about that whole AIDS thing...

But the cost of falling outside of social norms still exists, and don't
easily dissappear by a whim, or a wave of a magic wand as you suggest.

Me thinks this is a huge goal of yours. One of which you are achieving.

But the your type have multi-front warfare going on, and hijacking

(nice try)

"offend" ??  dude (shal I call you "dude-ette" ?)  This is an extremely
"selfish" statement, tactic, and mindset, and I absolutly dispise it!
According to your logic, I don't like being broke, therefore "practices"
that make people wealthy should *also* be eliminated.  And as far as
"as matters of sex and race" goes, don't you really mean "as matters
in sexual PREFERENCES and race" ??

You ARE treated as equal.  You are a MALE (I presume), and treated
as such. "behaviour" and "belief" does  * N O T  *  qualify you for
"special treatment", and thats what you are after here.  This whole
"I'm offended" thing makes me want to puke! - its a scam, a ploy,
unmeasurable, SELFISH, unregulated psyco-bable.  One can walk
around and say "I'm ofended" at just about ANYTHING just to attempt
to get special treatment, and that is sneaky, cowardly, gutless,
lacks substance, and more importantly lacks total charactor !!

Its simple!:  When 80-90% of the population turn up gay, I'll be the
first in line at the shrinks office!  Until then, and as long as I'm
in the *vast* majority, and you are outside of the social norm, I'll
be here in the world telling you so. (and you can bank on that!)
BTW: Recent findings from the shrinks say that many gays are going
them to become "un-gay", and the success rate at straighting them
out are alarming!  Maybe gayness fad will wear off.

Yup, preciesly!  And you in your very statement, you even admidt it.
(you just said "since the majority seems to riducule my friends..")
Doesn't that tell you something?  (maybe a hint, clue ?)

Sorry, that is a "rebel".

To push the beliefs of 10% of the people onto the remaining 90%
is SELFISH to say the least!!

Nawwww, shit, that other "90%" doesn't constitute the "other"
aspects of out society.

You can get counceling for this - might be heat rash.

Look up about your flaunting escapades in the street, then look 
a few post before that about "ridicule".

Thats right pal, whats fair for you, is fair for all. Little concerned 
that a plan that actually address ALL situations will steal all of 
your thunder, and spread the funds too thin ?  ...You wanted "equality".

I *know* you don't get it - thats the problem.  You say you want
"equality", but when confronted with equality, you don't get it.
This gives your case so many more holes, its beyond Swiss Cheese.

Thats a crock.  if so, why do so many people who are already married

Correct.  Much like your type compaign for "gay" marriage, to be "equal",
the campaign for inter-family should be given "equal" presidance.

Discriminating are you?  Ridicule perhaps ?  You don't even remotely
practice what you preach.

Sure...  "Your" cause first, *then* other principally equal causes
afterwards.  Sorry, at this point in the discussion, you've 
really come across as fairly selfish.

But of course, "MY, MY, MY" ....  That big ole selfish streak comes out.
"Equal" just for the sake of your argument, but not in practice. Nice...

Suuuuuure it is!, only when its YOUR principal.

Bullshit!

I *know* you don't - thats at the heart of your problem/struggle.

We're NOT in agreement here.  You "say" you want "equal", but only
for YOUR cause, and none other.

Right, and thoes things are the "social norm".

And if getting laid is something that is on my weekend ajenda, it
CERTINALLY isn't any business of a co-worker, and is a private matter.
If you are offering that information to a co-worker (gay or not),
then THAT in inapproiate office beaviour.

Mention a wife, sure you can (if you want). Your "friend" ? Sure 
you can. Your gay friend? Well, what happens if these office
people don't want gay people at their private gathering in
their homes ????  So now you want to extend you new rules to
peoples HOMES too ???  Take a hike pal - ain't happening.

I may be forced to tollerate gays in the office, (and I do), 
but when it comes to mentioning a gathering at my home for
married couples to watch Sunday football, it is implied that
said married couples are of the man-woman variety. Plain and simple.
So you now want "inclusion" too???  Well, if I mention a party
that I'm having at my place, and say "bring a friend", you are
more than welcome to bring your gay friend, I have no problem
with that. But if you "act" gay at the party, I'm not responsible
for what anyone feels, or thinks of you during, or afterwards.
