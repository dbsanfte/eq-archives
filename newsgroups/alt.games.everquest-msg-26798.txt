I do drive-by buffings when I am travelling. If I pass a pet caster, I
skin and sow the caster, skin, strength, sow the pet. I started this
when a caster thanked me for SoW, but informed me that without Sow on
the pet, they have to walk anyways. I hadn't thought of it before
then, makes sense. So I thanked them for the information, and SoW'd
the pet. Then unloaded every buff I could stack on the pet.
I always skin the caster, I know they don't melee, but extra AC and HP
can't hurt if things get hairy.
