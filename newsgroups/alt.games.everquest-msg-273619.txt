In all fairness to the OP, he did put a question mark after that 'minus'. I 
myself hadn't gotten far enough into the game to know what type of 
tradeskills were available, but after sending my reply, I checked out the 
WoW website and discovered the page that details the tradeskills. Definitely 
something I'll want my characters checking out. :)

Thank you for putting that in far better words than I did. When I first 
started playing EQ2, I was impressed by the quality of the graphics; when I 
first started WoW, I was blown away by the beauty of the graphics. Among 
other things. :)
