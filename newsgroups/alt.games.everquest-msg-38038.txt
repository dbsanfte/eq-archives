Say, aren't you a Star Wars fan? :)

Sorry, couldn't help it.  I loved the movie (well, the 
ending was fairly high in the cheese factor, but I can 
forgive that) but then I'm a special effects junkie.  
Show me anything 'cool' and I can survive nearly 
anything (Okay, not Titanic.  NEARLY anything.  Not 
Titanic.)
