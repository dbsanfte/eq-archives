    Only if something live is in the Library itself. If not, then ITU up and
after the first drop-off that puts you outside the Frenzied room, drop down
again into the short tunnel near the Loom room and walk in the back way.
You'll only see undead in the back part. Once you get the drop, move to the
safe corner outside of the Library or move into a corner of the Nibbler room
and use the Thurg Gate potion all melees should own. Or bring a mage friend
and have them CotH you back out. If you have some sort of run speed, good
MR, and a solid idea where you're going you can train out without incident,
too.

    We've got a crew with ally Chardok faction, and anytime someone needs
this piece we send one of them down and multiquest it. It's amazing what you
can pull to zone with a level 60 ally faction puller, BTW.

    We set up in a tiny area at the base of a staircase which you get to by
swimming through a tunnel in the back right-hand corner. Solid XP, even with
cyans, was very doable with three people, cleared to Decayed Kylong Iksar
(PH) with ease. Even got an Iksar Berserker Club - I never thought I'd see
one of those actually drop.
