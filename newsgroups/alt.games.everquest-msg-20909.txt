I dont know what level you are but in the higher levels the Healers job is
to heal stunning is for the most part a waste because it is resisted quite a
bit and meleeing is a waste of time due to the low damage a cleric can do.
All decent clerics in upper levels have Wis based armor and Weapons if the
carry a weapon. In a tough battle a cleric runs out of mana soon enough I
see no reason for him to waste it or waste med time to due a minor amount of
Damage. I do agree with you on an Enchanter Clarity and Haste buffs are a
bonus their job is to keep bad pulls from getting out of hand and slow the
damage the mob inflects. If you get into a group always have the Tanks to
set up a Assist hot key to assist the puller that way everyone is fighting
the same mob so the Chanter can do his job. it also never hurts to set up
hot key macors to anounce to the group what spell you are casting specficly
with DOTs and Heals so you dont waste mana.
