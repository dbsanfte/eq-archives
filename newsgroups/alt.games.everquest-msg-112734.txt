Because they are?

Seriously, that's not a "geez what an idiot" answer, it's
part of the design of the game.  Monks deal damage
better than any class except a rogue who is in Backstab
position.  Talking about warrior weapons and such
isn't really as viable a proposition because that'd be
the same as me saying "why can't i outdamage a monk
when I'm level 50 using a dragoon dirk and he's level
50 using his epic fists?"

Monks and rogues have higher skill caps in some
areas, and are on different combat tables than the
other melee classes (including hybrids).  It's a more
effective table for dealing damage than that given to
a warrior for instance.  Monks dual-weild more (and I
think may double attack more).  Combine that with
more successful attacks and then you'll start getting
the picture.

But don't take my word for it.  It's been logged and
parsed and debated for over 2 years now (I don't
say for 3 because who the hell knew what they
were doing before Kunark came out ? ;-) </jk>).
It's built into the design of the game.
