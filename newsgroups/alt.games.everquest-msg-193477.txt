I'd be interested in your comments on this system I am considering:

P$ 3.06 GHz, 512 MB RDRAM, 60GB Ultra ATA/1`00 7200 RPM HD, 16 MAX DVD
ROM and 4x DVD+RW/CD-RW, GeForce4 MX 64MD DDR video card.

Could get this system for about $1300 from Dell.

I have though of going the build-it-yourself route but I don;t have
the desire to do all the homework necessary to learn all the stuff
(component wise) that I would have to learn in order to make the right
component choices.
