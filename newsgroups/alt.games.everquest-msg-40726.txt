Hehe,

A 50+ monk (iksar better for the regen) can pull down 100 or so pp per hour of
mindlessly killing everything in sight in Unrest.  The only catch is you'll need a
mule parked outside to transfer  all the loot to (preferably a druid who can port
to Misty and sell/bank in RV).  I can stand a couple of hours of this before it
becomes so boring I switch to DoD for less mindless killing.

Of course this means having a 50+ monk who's time is better spent grouped in
Sebilis or some other place where there's xp and far phatter loot.
