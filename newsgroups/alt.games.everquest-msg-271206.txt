No doubt you *can* start to learn there but there are plenty of old
world dungeons which are kinda unique. ;) Kaesora, LGuk or even
Befallen. Though I never went there when my chanter was of appropriate
level. Though you are right in LDoN you lern a little CC. ;)

I might be wrong here but didn't you play a cleric? With one of my
recent alts I was in Paludal Caverns in a bandits group. The tank was
tempted (pun intended ;D) and our cleric just refuses to heal him. And
this for good reason. He did not have the heals and the mana pool to do
anything useful there. Sure it's PC but don't you think this cleric was
at least a bit embarassed? I bet he never even glanced at the hp bar of
the tank as it clearly wasn't his buisiness anymore. It could definitaly
be more fun and challenging when everyone just use the tools the group
does have. Though I think we don't disagree here. :)

I know. I was dumbfounded when I opened my inventory and checked my HP.
And since this buff is for free I made a hotkey for the phrase and
killed mobs until I die. Respawning nearly infront of the Buff NPC I
press my hotkey and go off on another killing spree.

Since this is a somewhat limited dungeon I think SOE is right to make it
as easy as it is.
