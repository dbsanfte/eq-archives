The only big downside to the barter zone separate from the bazaar is 
that you can't buy and sell at the same time. It would have been nice to 
have a standing offer to purchase 200 leather padding, while hawking 
your junk.

They did have the sense to put the barter zone between the pok and 
bazaar, so while you are on the way to setup your trader you can peek to 
see if there's any offers out for the stuff you were planning to unload. 
(Bazaar mules arent helped by this of course).

But yeah, by and large its a pretty boneheaded design.

I think it was on purpose though, and there are a couple pluses. I'm 
hopeful it will mitigate *some* of the price gouging. Vendors who run 
around the pok essentially price fixxing items often piss me off. I 
routinely walk into pok loaded with research components, and other 
unsual drops that I'd be happy to drop on someone who could use them for 
a few plat... but if I set up a trader they just get snapped up and then 
immediately relisted for 10x-15x the price.

But if I see a 20th level necro in the barter zone looking for 5 copies 
of one of the words needed to research his 20s pet @ 5pp each, I'd drop 
my copy of the words on him fairly secure in the knowledge that this 
isn't some elaborate ploy to buy-low sell high. Sure theres a potential 
that someone running bazaar games will try to sucker me, but now he 
requires two accounts, and he has to keep his greed in check.

After all, if he's looking for 20 copies of both words, a fungi tunic, 
etc etc... I won't have any inclination to beleive he's just a 20th 
level newbie necro trying to get a few shots at his pet without shelling 
out 375pp for it. And its not worth paying for a 2nd eq box to pose as a 
newbie to make small amounts of cash.
