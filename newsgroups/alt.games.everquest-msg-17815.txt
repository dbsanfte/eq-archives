looking for info/stratagies on Plane of hate break and info on what is
needed to take Naggy down, for naggy the most likely lvls will be from 49 to
52 so was thinking we could get by with 2 or 3 groups but have no idea never
gone to either


the other thing is I am on VZ and play on the dark team so straragies will
have to be with no druid pally and bards
basicially Troll Ogre Dark elf and Iksars

Thanks in advance
