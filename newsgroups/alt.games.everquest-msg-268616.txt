Yeah good point.

It's just me being greedy I guess. I can level my guy upto lvl 13-15 quite 
quickly as a adventurer but the tradeskill side really takes some going.

One other plus point that I failed to mention is the performance of the 
game. I never seen any lag! I do have a 2Mb connection but I thought i'd 
notice lag, but so far none.

Like I said though, it's a really fun game. I dropped out of PC gaming for 
around 2-3 yrs after becoming jaded. Half Life 2 and now Everquest 2 have 
really got me sucked back in though.
