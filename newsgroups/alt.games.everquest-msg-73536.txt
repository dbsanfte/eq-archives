Yep and anyone who does a search for 5.5 seconds can find freeware
popup stoppers like the one at www.panicware.com making those pop up
ads moot. I've always wondered something though, can the page with the
popup or the advertiser placing it there tell if you have a popup
stopper? For some reason I bet they can't so to them it registers as a
person having hit their pop up.

I still never got the whole click through thing. I mean, if I had the
ability to "click" on a television commercial i'd not do it but that
still doesn't mean that I'm not aware of the commercial. If TV
advertising copied the web and only based being paid upon "clicks" (if
we had some way to click) then all of your favorite shows would be
taked off the air OR it might cause people to click a lot during shows
they liked just to keep them on. Either way though, its not making you
go out and buy the product anymore than not clicking.
