That's not a problem with twinking, that's a problem with fuckwits in
the game--of which there are plenty.

Personally, I like twinking.  Twinking is good.  I gave my twinkie
warrior full crafted, treeweave, royal velium armor, lamentation +
crystalline shortsword, FBSS (had an RBB but had to give that to a
guildie's main--all mains in the guild have at least an FBSS or
better) and managed to even get him a pair of JBoots (back when E
Karana spawn table was royally screwed up and the AC was popping more
often than Broon).

The end result:  I have a tank that I can play for fun when my main is
stuck in VP.

Twinking, when done to an obscene level, is a good thing.
