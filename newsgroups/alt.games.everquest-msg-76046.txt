Re: the videocard issues

I find likewise, I run an Athlon 600, MAtrox G400 with 374Mb Ram. (Running
low on HD space, too, at 7-8 Gb left.)
The problem is definitely post-luclin, cos I could run round Kurn's Tower on
Kunark, no probs until the big post-luclin patch.
Even now that I have installed Luclin, I get the same thing, maybe worse,
probably due top the new textures.

I tried some PvP in Queynos and couldn't move round the city, regardless o
what I did to the clip-plane and detail levels.
I hear it's something to do with modelling building interiors, even when you
can't see them.
A directX thing, apparently, but THEY (EQ) SHOULD FIX IT. We pay to play,
not to be graphics-lagged to pieces and lose our exp to foes we can't even
con.
