Here is where I had a thought ... there are not 2 sides to this whole
arguement ... but 3.


1.  The "I want it all, and I want it yesterday crowd" - this would be the
d00ds that feel getting to level 65 in 4 days is cool, then sit back and
wonder why no one is asking them to group

2. The "You guys got it way to easy as newbs crowd"  - This IMO are the
veterans that battled all the way to the top without the benefits of todays
game.  I can see both sides here. Although for the money that this game
costs me, I want to be able to enjoy and experience a major protion of the
game within the first 2 or 3 months I start playing ... which is almost
impossible the old way unless you were major twinked, knew alot of people
with your main, or got lucky.  I started playing about 2 weeks after Velious
came out, started a rogue and promptly sat around for a week after hitting
level 10 *waiting* for someone to answer my /ooc rogue LFG ... made a druid,
got to 20th lvl, found out alot of people resented the druid class, made a
ranger ... mixed feelings here, finally went back to druid. why? I could go
where I wanted to, fight, tradeskill, chat, whatever *I* wanted to do with
my 15 bucks a month.

3.  The third group is the mix of people that think the portals are a bad
thing, and at the sametime have a druid toon and say something about glad my
druid has more time to play now insteaad of answering a bazillion tells for
ports, buffs. etc.


Of course, this is all my opinion from about 2-3years of reading this group
and/or others that have had discussions on the game.



Personally: I like the portals as it makes me get a feeling that I can
actually PLAY during the 10 hours a week spent travelling pre-PoP.  now
thats 40 hours a month approx spent travelling, unless you are someone who
doens't mind spending alot of time in one zone for 10 levels ... I need more
variety.  So for me, they work.  And it has made paying for a sow
nonexistant! I have never, ever, adn will enver pay or donate for a 30 mana
spell.  Even if I am told I should for his time :) 30 mana isn't worth much
time, and yes my druid sow'd constantly for free when I was bored or didn't
get interested in something

I went to gfay, rv, freeport, qeynos, oggok, grobb, neriak, and most places
alot of newbies hung out and hollered I was sowing for free ... WC was a
riot proior to luclin. Anways, I dont know about the rest of you, but I like
feeling like I did something today when i log in ...

but the pop portals are a bit much ... maybe implementing a quest for each
and every pop book before being able to use it would be a very good idea :)
