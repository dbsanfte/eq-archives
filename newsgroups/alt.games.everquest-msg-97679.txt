She said something very similar this.

     Didn't you notice that I kept rejecting that
     name?  Don't EVER do that again!  I still
     haven't decided whether I'm going to
     terminate your account.

The trouble is he already had a character he'd worked on and
really enjoyed.  For some time after, he worried that it would
be gone without warning.  I tried to convince him that it was
unlikely, but had little luck, due to the authority of the person
who threatened it.  Hence, btw, my mentioning an exaggerated
respect for authority.

A simple warning that a rule was being broken would have been
appropriate, and quite sufficient.
