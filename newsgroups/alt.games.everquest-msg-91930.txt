EQ always does stand out for "the one that don't work right", doesn't
it.  That does get annoying.  I know I spent a lot of time fiddling in
the bios on my machine.  Dunno how other games run - haven't bought
one for about 1.5 years now.  :)

It may be... I really can't quantify it - all CPUs seem to be pegged
regardless of speed.
The only guy in the guild that zones faster than I do has a similar
system, but with a 64mb GF2 card.  Had been (probably incorrectly)
assuming that was a big differentiator.  Lately though, we're both
running around 11 seconds for zones.

Well heck, if yer gonna reformat the machine solely for games, you may
want to lose XP.  =)   Good ol' 98se is still on my machine (dual boot
win2k/se) solely for gaming.

And no, I agree - you can't ask much more at all.

[and no, I'm not arguing with you!]
