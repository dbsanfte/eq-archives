I dont know about Shaman slows,are they disease based?
Did my first Ldon with my 42 Enc lately,and was surprised
how many slow resists I got,mob tashed or not.
After a while I changed my tactic,after the first slow resist
I switched to nuking,does not make much sense to slow a 
mob at 50% health,when a nuke brings it down to nearly
20% health.
