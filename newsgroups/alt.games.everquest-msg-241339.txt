Thanks Annie! Aye, the Reso team are a great group of people. I expected a
certain level of competence from a guild that is Time-enabled and I saw this
in spades as we ran around doing applicant raids, with targets like Xegony,
Coirnav, and many Zeks dropping systematically. What I didn't necessarily
expect was that they're also a hell of a lot of fun to play with. On one of
the backflagging raids, Rogues were tanking and a Cleric was designated MA
for Grummus. The other guild has some fine people in it too, but when I
grouped with them and visited the two respective web sites, the contrast in
styles and maturity was pretty apparent to me and it became easy for me to
favor reso. I'm very happy with my choice and happy that they adopted me
into their family.

See ya in FV, whenever it comes back up!
