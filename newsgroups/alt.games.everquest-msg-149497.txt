I would've felt a lot worse about it if I hadn't been up there with the
Bulthar for about 13 minutes prior to him plopping his ass down.  As for
kiting them down below, that also wasn't an option, as I needed my mana
regen wolf form, which puts me KoS to Othmir.

Ideally though, I train everyone in the zone, they die, and I get to party
with the sirens, maybe port out to pick up some 4 arms and vampyres in ME
and bring them back to the party real quick...

Or else I'm just wishing that there was more EQ porn out there.  I mean
really, don't you wonder what Aten and all her minions were doing in Vex
Thal for the first 6 months of Luclin?  Or who did her breast enlargements?
Hell, I want to know where all the Giant women are, I mean, you've got
hundreds of angry warrior men wandering around the city, beating the heads
of intruders, but after a long day of crushing infidels, all you really want
to do is go home to your giantess and get some, right?

Hrm... or else the giants are sufficiently advanced that they've discovered
how to have gay assbabies....

I need help. =/
