One of 3 named orcs that occassionaly show up on the orc side of the
pass. Holds Giant items, which makes it somewhat unusual. A good reason
to hang out here in the 16-20 range. Exp and possible loot. =)

Bootstrutters Framed Backpack is 10 slot, and 10% reduction as well.
(also NoDrop). It can be easily quested for in Ak'Anon, though you'd
need to be amiable with the Gemchoppers (gnome warriors guild) to do
so. Can be done in the early single digit levels as well.

Also, if you can give up a tailor made backpack, there's a quest in
Kerra Ridge that will give you a bag with less slots, but greater
weight reduction.
