Ponila Quickfingers in East Commons. I remember it well. Bitch ganked
my halfling twice all by herself. She is in a hut all by herself. She is on
Coalition of Tradesfolk Illegal and I didn't realize I had lowed my faction
that much doing quests.

The merchants and banker in Runnyeye will definitely attack you if you
are KoS.

Other specific time I can remember is when I took my SK a little too
close to Erudin and one of the Erudite Merchants that are in Toxx attacked me.

Most Druid ring merchants don't attack on sight. Which is where I think
most people get the idea that merchants don't attack.

Also, I have an Iksar Monk that is ally to the Guardians of the Vale(deputies)
from killing goblins in rivervale, but KoS to the Merchants. I walked to close to
Twippie Diggs a merchant and he went off on me, the Deputies only attacked
me as I ran by them to the zone, so I was not on their hate list until Twippie
alerted them.
