Kane Bayle (where I play) is one of the lowest population servers - so
maybe there aren't many high level enchanters?  When I play it is
pretty rare for more than one person to be advertising KEI for sale. 
It is always 100pp or sometimes 2pp per level up to 100pp.   On the
odd occasion someone will do it for free, but I have only seen this a
couple of times.
