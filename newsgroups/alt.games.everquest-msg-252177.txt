If you can believe the comments posted towards the end of the
second link, for instance:

"This incident has been reported to the FBI Internet Fraud
Department, and tomorrow to the RCMP. We have compiled as much
information as possible on this person, including his name,
address, phone number, email addresses and the IPs used to log
into our site. All of this information will be turned over to
the authorities."

it would appear that the seller is indeed pursuing legal
action, via the relevant authorities.  Whether or not the
scammer's actions were criminal may well be tested in court.
