Actually, that's not true. There are massive problems with these:

10 Elderly just can't deal out the required dps
 9 They mitigate slow... which can be good, given some voters
 8 They proc "chad waste" which can AE snare if its allowed to build up
 7 Only one person allowed in booth, so no CC possible
 6 Takes YEARS to repop, unless you go through a very costly turn-in quest.
 5 Feign death gets you banished from the zone
 4 RvR really sucks
 3 Hasn't been a patch in decades
 2 Have to kill the PH to get a decent spawn, but that gets you zone-wide agro

and the number one reason that paper-punch ballots suck on a.g.e.:

 1 No APs even when you "take out the boss"

For future reference, this is an EQ group ;-)
