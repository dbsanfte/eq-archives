Not the error, but I've had a lot of disconnects this weekend. Also server
ping was almost constantly above 1000 for hours on end. Including weird
"half" discons where I had about 5--60% packet loss.

I think Verant screwed something up with this last one. Didn't see an
emergency patch either. They usually do that to clean up the mess a
scheduled patch creates :)
