Question: What's the spawn time of Begurgle? And does he pop in the
same little tower as the Corrupted Aquagoblin? I've sat there for
hours waiting for him, and have seen the Tainted Aquagobby pop 3 times
in that period. I'm a Druid, so that was fine with me the 1st time :),
but I have guildies I'm trying to assist...
