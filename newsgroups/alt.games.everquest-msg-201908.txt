To go further off topic.... I got introduced to role playing with the "In 
The Labyrinth" system from some group down in I think it was Austin that 
had a LOT of smaller boardgames that came in little boxes that cost 3.99 
or 4.99 each.  Any of you remember these?

I liked playing with those guys and a girl down in Warner Robins, Georgia  
better than any experience I had with D&D.  Most of them had played D&D 
but thought In The Labyrinth was better for role playing because you 
played the game instead of the game playing you.  Just six sided dice and 
easy stats to work with and a lot of GM decisions whether something may 
work or not.

I remember being a newbie and this fight broke out in a tavern where we 
(a group of three newbies) were supposed to meet an experienced player we 
had not met.  Well I did my good as a member of the group and helped my 
mate during the fight, isn't that what you're supposed to do?  This new 
guy, cast a curse on me because he thought I was being unfair and ganging 
up on this poor NPC, and I was not able to hit *anything* that night..... 
it finally cost us a lot when we finally went out adventuring.....we 
newbies, got wiped out....  It was weeks before the GM and this guy (a 
louie in the Air Force) told us what had happened....  enough time for us 
to think it was pretty funny and learn our lesson.

Ahh, when it was all new and we were blessed by a great storytelling GM--  
a master of imagery, all of the senses, by the way, and you could feel 
the moisture on the walls of the cave you were descending and a group of 
folk who believed "Role Playing" was the reason we had gathered.

Ahh, just did a quick google search.....Metagaming.... The Fantasy Trip.  
3 small books, In The Labyrinth, Melee and Wizard or Magic or 
something.... Also found out that Steve Jackson developed it.  Will 
wonders never cease?

Great times indeed.
