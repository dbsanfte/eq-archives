  Sometimes it's just too obvious; you see things coming from miles away.
So it was last week as Adas got her last necessary keys: two weeks of
low karma, manifesting in stupid mistakes and low turnout and raid
targets not up, was due to expire Wednesday. That being an exp day
for my guild, I expected things to really move starting Thursday.
  They did. Off to Sol Ro Tower to clean up some chamber flag
minis. Dresolik was messy and took forever, but Rizlona was up, and
once down, Adas was chamber flagged. Xuzl rounded out the day;
I knew at least two people needed him. Savs is now that much closer
to raiding Fire.
  Friday, the big one: another crack at Time. We've been religious about
this, and word has gotten around of our efforts; allies are easier to come
by now. Phase 1 goes down in record time, we avoid the silly mistakes
and weaknesses that slowed us down in Phase 2 last time, and Phase 3
lies before us. Here, we stumble, nearly wiping a few times and losing
too much time to recovery to make it to Phase 4 that day. But we do get
five named down, and each has a Time Phased Quintessence, the fabled
Key to Time. Cue the Dr. Who theme music. These all go to our most
reliable and needed people, which naturally includes Adas.
  So: Adas is now Time keyed. This could be the beginning of the end
for my game, as there is little chance Saviours can muster the numbers
for a run through GoD or the larger MPG trials, and we know how far
we are from even taking our Volkara, so DoN looks limited. Monday,
however, we finished Phase 3, getting four more keys, and cleared
Phase 4, with a raid that had become semi-open, 62 poeple at one point.
And the drops were somehow going to the right people, the ones
who would most strengthen the guild.
  Today we will try to take some of the gods in Phase 5. The most
desired thing, however, is another clearing of Phase 3 with keys;
one more run should be enough for everyone who still isn't keyed.
Then we will need no allies, though they will likely still be welcome
to come; we will be able to raid Time at our lesiure, and start burning
huge amounts of DKP.
