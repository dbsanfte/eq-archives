If you want to discuss the merits of top versus bottom posting, please 
start a new thread, because most people will want to ignore it.

The convention of the AGE group is to bottom post, or really to post 
under each item you are responding to within a post, and snip the 
sections that aren't relevant.

Note that Seeq advised "in this group", which I think is reasonable; 
while each posting methods have their merits, mixing top and bottom 
posting within a single group is annoying, and within a single thread 
really really messy.  (look, for example, at this post, where you top 
posted, then we see Seeq's original message, and then my response, not 
to him, but to you.  And thats pure bottom post, I should really be 
posting under what you said since I'm not replying to him)
