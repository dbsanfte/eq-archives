You're making the incorrect assumption that the hacker can't send
multiple independent requests simultaneously. While I'm sure each
requests intentionally takes a second or more to be responded to,
nothing stops you from sending 10000 independent requests. I'm sure the
login servers are designed to handle several requests simultaneously.
Maybe not 10k per second, but definitely more than 1 per second. This
can make up for several orders of magnitude. It's really anybody's
guess how many attempts the login servers can handle simultaneously -
without testing it. Unless they are on some kind of round-robin DNS,
you'll be limited to about 65k ports per server. But most likely they
will have multiple servers, maybe even round robin DNS, so the
theorethical limit is probably a multiple of that. The bottleneck will
probably be processing the request on the servers, but thousands, even
10s of thousands simultaneous per second are not unrealistic. The
attacker would probably need several computers to generate that many
requests though. Maybe a network of zombies.

Why? Sometimes they don't even take the login servers down. But
regardless the hacker could have (pointlessly mind you) started
attempting to log in while he was in trader mode. Each one of those
attempts would of course fail. They were probably smarter than that
though.

My bet would be that the hacker started about 10 or so minutes into the
patch, whatever the time is that you are allowed to be logged in, but
not connected to a game server. After that time, it would be a safe bet
that the target user was "logged out" due to timeout. From then on
(assuming the login servers weren't down) he could have attempted to
break into the account, while the patch was in progress.

The login servers would also not be very busy during that time, so that
he could process nearly at their maximum capacity of login requests per
second.
