Which is entirely of their own free will. They're not being lied to or
even told half-truths. They're not being forced to do anything.
They're making the choice themselves and acting on that decisions.
There's absolutely nothing dishonest about what they're doing. It
baffles me that anyone could possibly get such a bug up their ass
about something so trifling.
