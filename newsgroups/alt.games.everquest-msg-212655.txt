Picked up the Solstic ring last night, the nine items ran about 4K on
luclin.  The Idol, fishing pole, and sickle ran about 1K each with the
other stuff less.  Felt like I got a bargin on the star ruby encrusted stein
as they were selling for 200-400, and one fellow was unloading two for
95pp.....bought both, and started a friend on the road to the earing as
well.

Aoebe has been called a 'twink' at times, and it kind of bothers her some.
She has all of her nice stuff, save the Warhammer of Divine Grace, earned
through tradeskills or looting....   so she really doesn't consider getting
these
nice things twinking....she is within one level of her barbarian friend, but
they
only exchange pelts, and tradeskill items.....
