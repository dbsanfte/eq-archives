I love the new graphics engine.

I have a pretty good video card that does DirectX 9 decoding on the hardware
though......a GeCube ATI 9600XT Extreme (2.5ns)

However I've found that in the Bazaar, I can move Sooooo much better with
the new engine.  None of the 3 frames a second looking thing.  Still a bit
laggy at 100% clip plane, but nothing like before.  A marked improvement.

Anyone else found the new engine an improvement instead of a hassle?

Tuv.
