Lucy has been around for quite some time and even developers refer to it as
a source of info for players.
The spelldata there is simply ripped from the spelldata file everyone
downloads. Anyone with a hex editor can read it so that's not much news.

The info you get from the item collector is nothing more then you can figure
out ingame.
As long as you don't alter the information stream or decode encrypted data
it's not illegal to sniff the packets afaik.
At least SOE knows about lucy for quite some time and never has taken any
action against them so far.

Heh this program was tested by people using other packet sniffers to see
what lucy is sending and to where. So far all has checked out.
I'm pretty sure allakhazam has the source code right now as well though. If
any modifications need to be made someone has to do it :).
