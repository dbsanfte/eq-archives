You are, of course, a fucking idiot.

Ben, we've been patrolling the "no-fly" zones in northern and
southern Iraq continuously for ten years now, at no minor cost
(over 150,000 sorties flown) and at great risk to our pilots,
who keep getting shot at on a regular basis (over 500 incidents
in the past year alone).  The US bill for the southern zone
alone in fiscal year 2000 was $1.4 billion.

You know why?  Hint: We can't pilfer any oil from those
altitudes, so you can't trot out your favorite conspiracy theory,
sorry.

We do it to prevent Saddam from flying in and bombing/gassing
the Kurds in the north and the Shi'ites in the south.

It's been in all the papers for, oh, a decade or so.
Perhaps you were napping, or too engrossed in the 
high-stakes world of Canadian fishing disputes.

I see...  So we "never heard" again about their issues?
How about:

   "...both major Kurdish parties in northern Iraq 
  believe that the no-fly-zone aircraft provide a 
  security guarantee from the United States should 
  Saddam attack. Former secretary of state Madeleine 
  Albright reinforced this belief in a September 2000 
  speech laying out "red lines" that would generate a U.S. 
  response, which included attacks or provocations against 
  the Kurds, threats against Iraq's neighbors or U.S. forces, 
  or a reconstitution of WMD. In July 2001, Secretary of 
  State Colin Powell went further when he wrote a letter 
  to the two main Kurdish leaders, Jalal Talabani (Patriotic
  Union of Kurdistan) and Masud Barzani (Kurdistan Democratic
  Party), stating, "As we have said before, should Saddam's
  forces move against the Kurds, it is our policy that the
  United States would respond in a strong and sure manner 
  at a time and place of our choosing."
    -- Lt. Col. Phillip Gibbons; The Washington Institute
       for Near East Policy 

*I* heard about this, what's your excuse?

Get.  A.  CLUE.

God, you're a sanctimonious asshole.  Don't presume to lecture 
me when you haven't any idea what you're talking about.

You would be well advised to switch to a different brand 
of propaganda yourself, Ben.  Your current source has 
led you seriously astray.
