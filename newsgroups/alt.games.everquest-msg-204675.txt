Put your stat enhancing foods in the upper left hand slot of your first 
bag, ie your FIRST food should be the picnic basket, place stat enhancing 
drink to the right of the food. Now, here is a, I'm sure well known, trick 
Buy regular food and water. Eat and drink manually the regular stuff and 
let your stat food and drink just sit there. If you plan right and keep 
using the regular food and drink your stat food and drink can last forever!
