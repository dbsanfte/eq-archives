Except, in the cursory scan I did of the document, I found no examples
which apply here. Only definitions and theory that read like stereo
instructions.

Yet, I have no desire to experience part of your real life. No
offense, I just have no reason to. I play EQ for the game as
advertised. Nowhere on the box did it invite me to "Come see how Bag
of Memmes interacts with others in his/her own unique way!"

Can't think of any trends in fantasy literature that support the term
"wizzie". It just doesn't fit. "Twitch bitch" is another one you will
be hard pressed to find.

The game itself is boring and ugly in *your* opinion. That doesn't
mean it should be altered or bastardized into something that better
entertains you. I enjoy it immensely as it stands. There are other
venues that would provide you with these features you mention far more
successfully. The Sims online would be perfect. It's more a reflection
of RL.

Not all diminutives. Just the ones that are not based on anything.
Wizzie means *nothing* and the alteration is made *for no reason*.
What are people saying, small wizard? No, people use it to refer to
*any* wizard, regardless of size. Therefore, it's just an unnecessary
variation on the term "wizard". So again I ask, why not just say
"wizard"? All I can surmise is they find it too "ten minutes ago" or
to D&D geeky.

What's cool about it? I just want the game to be unmolested by the
superficiality of others.

Perhaps you should work on your reading comprehension. I never said
anything of the sort. However, your cheap shot speaks volumes.

But we're not talking about an evolving world here. It is static. It
is a set atmosphere and environment. It is what it is and that is not
open for interpretation or alteration. It is to be enjoyed as it
stands. I find the insistence upon changing it in this way to be both
presumptuous and annoying.

What does it freaking matter?! Please don't split hairs. There was no
underlying implication there.

Nothing of the sort. But it *is* one where terminology would be
consistent with the fantasy genre or at least neutral in it's
inconsistency.
