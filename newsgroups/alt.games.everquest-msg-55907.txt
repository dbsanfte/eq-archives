Epic critters, supposedly, sure.  Very high level critters, sure,
supposedly.  I know that Faydedar resisted every magic-based spell
(recently) that I cast on it within melee range.  These are supposed to be
hard encounters.

I went to RM to fart around, NOT to require a tank and a healer to go with
me...and yes, both of those would be absolutely REQUIRED.   And I prefer not
to have to cart around a minimum of 2 friends when I'm just farting around,
but you're more than welcome to.

But I'm not complaining.  They weren't fun so I didn't stay.  No harm, no
foul.
