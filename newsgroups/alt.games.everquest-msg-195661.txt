I agree insofar as we are talking about lower leveled folks.  They can
get a KEI and have it last as long as 4 hours (with proper aa's and foci),
and they weren't getting anything better than clarity before.

For folks of the appropriate level to be raiding/grouping with KEI enabled
'chanters, though, the big thing was the fact that they didn't have to
refresh it all the time.  The difference between a medding caster with C2
and a medding caster with KEI is less than 10%.  I achieve a far better
boost to my sustained nuke DPS from summoned focus items.

Also, piggy backing, sorry :)  To Jamie, I played at release.  Yes, it
was hard as hell, but there was a profound pleasure in exploring new places
and not having any idea what you were running into.  The first slaying
of the Griffon in EC was like that - it was also the precursor to the now
standard raid method of MA with a healing chain.  At level 8 I equipped
my drum and ran south of N-RO to the (then) deserted Oasis, got tagged
by a named HG on my way through, then into the completely deserted S-Ro.
I made it to Innothule and blew the entire 10pp of my life savings on
several pairs of netted gloves - cloth ac but magic.  Survived the run
back north and sold each pair for 10-15pp to monks who wanted to hunt 
wisps.  They were more exciting days than now.  I try new MMORPG's as they
come out, not because I hate EQ (I've played for 4 years), but because I
want to experience those early days of adventure again.  Simply - it was
far from boring.  The only way to experience that sense of newness for the
past couple of years was to be in a tier 1 guild and be first to the
bosses.
