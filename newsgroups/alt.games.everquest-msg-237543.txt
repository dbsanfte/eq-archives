A stereo store chain's been shutting down for the past month or so
here in Calgary.  Yesterday was the final day.  Went in and picked up
the item I wanted.  $500 Sony 60-CD stereo system, got it for $100.
Demo model, so it's a bit dinged and the front door won't stay shut,
but I still think I got an excellent deal.

And it's under warranty, so I can get it repaired.
