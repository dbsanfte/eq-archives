I believe you don't lose any experience on death at level 10, so what you
can do if that kind of thing happens again is simply run for the zone.
Worst case, you don't make it and die.  That's probably better than taking
an unknown faction hit, especially with an NPC of your own race.  You can
*usually* get away with one mistake for any given faction, but why risk it?
