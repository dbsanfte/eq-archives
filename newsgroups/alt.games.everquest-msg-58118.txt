I hate to add to a crossposted thread, but just wanted to point out that the
Koran (however you want to spell it) is not the only holy book which can,
and has, been interpreted in numerous different ways to support the
viewpoint of said interpreter.  The Old Testaments come to mind, as do the
New Testaments.  In the end, individuals will interpret these books to suit
themselves, and then use it as an excuse, no matter what religion they may
be.  The only reason I point this out, is that from reading your posts, you
seem to be singling out Islam and the Koran.  If you ask mainstream Muslims,
you will find that, in general, they do not support terrorism, and that they
will vehemently deny that their religion in any way instructs, or allows
such behavior.
