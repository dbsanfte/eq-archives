If I remember from when the change was first made, someone parsed their
60cleric to produce 44DPS, another poster then added that his warrior
(unknown level) With Epics produced about 38dps...so I'd say a 56 Cleric far
out damages a 50 Warrior, which is of course how it should be, the term
Warrior was always misleading as is the opening line to the description
"Warriors are the masters of armed combat in all its many forms" which
actually means "The Warrior can ineffectually wield almost any weapon"

I have heard that the Warrior class will be totally removed from EQ2 to be
replaced with a new, more aptly named class, the Lunk.
The Lunk cannot actually wield damaging weapons but instead as a multitude
of offensive gestures in it's arsenal. Blessed with loads of hitpoints and
the ability to wear armour that looks better (but really is no more
effective at higher levels) they take the role of damage takers to a new
level, being able to both keep the mob occupied and suck up lots of damage
(well, in comparison to other classes, they do) they have a similar level of
solo potential to the original Warrior class.
I understand that at 55th, where previously the Warrior class gained the
class defining ability "Defensive" the Lunk will get "Ya Mom" insults,
taking them that bit further ahead of the other melee classes in holding
aggro.
