How much of roleplaying is keeping a certain in character attitude or 
affecting some odd speech, and how much is just not 'breaking the wall' 
(talking about work, etc...)?

(We got called a 'roleplaying linkshell' because most of us don't 'break 
the wall', and we have mannerisms for our characters... In fact I like 
to log on my mule and butter up the bosstaru... my main isn't like that 
though. :)
