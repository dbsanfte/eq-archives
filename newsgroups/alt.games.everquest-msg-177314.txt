Sorry to pick on Rumble here, but everyone has said 'yes'.

The answer is, in fact, 'no'.

If you played at release as you said you did the death penalty has been
halved since then. Further, class specific penalties have been removed
so you'll get more XP than you used to if you grouped with a hybrid
like a paladin or shadowknight.

The game is far far far easier. Travel is simple, rez's abound and the
quality of gear available has massively outpaced the difficulty of the
critters. Instead of fighting an orc in patchwork armour with a sharpened
longsword you'll be in better-than-banded with better-than-ykesha weapons
within a few weeks. That used to be the very best gear level 50's wore.

Each expansion has brought new spells to the classes available, even at
the lower levels, and new camping grounds with better loot and more xp.
Throughout your levelling you'll find certain 'golden' xp zones,
from paludal caverns to the bastion of thunder, you can fly to 65 if
you decide XP is what you want rather than travel.

Camping is massively improved; the world is huge now, and the populations
much more spread out so the killstealing and such is nowhere near as
harsh; there are NO camps that queues like Najena used to see, if somethings
camped people just move on in general. Theres plenty for everybody.

Roleplaying... well, roleplaying on the normal servers is dead, pretty much
completely. Its an arcade game now. If you want RP go to Firiona Vie.

Time. is. still. too. much. If you ended up playing too much before you
likely will again.

But... its still everquest , and fun, and now its *prettier* everquest with
curvier elves. So thats good.

Bye ;)
