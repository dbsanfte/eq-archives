While this is true to some extent, its not really relevant to getting 
groups: a search for clerics, say, will sort you by level.  Then you can 
take a look for titles (this is NOT the same as AA, but its at least a 
rough rule of thumb.)  Only on direct visual inspection will you get a 
sense of the gear level of the character, though, and even that is only 
the "visible" pieces.  For that you need to get yet another layer 
closer, and Inspect; in today's EQ culture, the equivalent of grabbing 
at breasts and running your hand up under a skirt.

Are most people aware what various items are for classes other than 
their own and what they look like?  In various shades of dye?

There's another layer: Dye status.  If you are clearly dyed up then 
you've dumped a few hundred pp on yourself just to look good, implying a 
certain level of competance in gathering wealth.

Oh, and a mount, have you got one?  There's some cash outlay... although 
you could argue that that is gear, its far more visible than most gear.

I don't see the connection really, although it often happens.  Having 
lots of AA doesn't mean having good gear; good gear comes from raiding, 
and raiding exp sucks.  Or it comes from spending lots of money, which, 
barring raiding, is best garnered by farming, which again, is usually 
abyssimal exp.  So if you were farming exp hard, you weren't getting 
good gear, and vice versa.

People dedicated enough to do the one are often the same people that put 
in the outrageous hours needed to do the other... but there's no 
requirement that they do so.

And if you see someone who's got the big titles at lower levels, then 
you tend to be looking at people who haven't really thought things thru, 
for most classes, most AA are a waste of time compared to just leveling up.

Is there a connection besides just "this guy is the sort that puts in 
the time?"  Well maybe there is.  Better gear means you kill faster and 
die less; so someone with better gear should be able to get those AA 
faster.  And to a lesser extent, AA can mean the same thing, which would 
at least speed up your farming efforts, if it won't do much for your 
raiding, this could mean getting better gear easier.

And maybe that title gets you into the raid, too... although thats not 
really the way to get the really good gear, pickup raids don't add up to 
a whole lot in the long run.
