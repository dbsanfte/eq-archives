  I'll give them their due. ;)  They're better than nothing.  However, after
playing a druid for 42 levels, I never felt my buffs were much in demand
(except for people wanting me to SoW them).  I would typically much rather
have Haste or a huge AC/HP boost as a tank, or Clarity as a caster, than
anything a druid can provide.

  Also I am one of those who doesn't like Levitate unless I'm in an area
where it is actually beneficial.  In some areas it really is a real pain,
especially if I'm running faster than I'm accustomed to.

  Yeah, their damage shields are good, but I don't think they account for
nearly as big a boost in damage output as Haste, especially if you're in a
melee heavy group.  Their AC/HP buff is good, a lot better than nothing, but
most all of the classes I mentioned have some sort of AC/HP buff, so the
fact that they are second or third best in this regard isn't as impressive
as the fact that they're 2nd to Magicians for damage shielding (since they
are the only two classes that get a decent DS).  They are second when it
comes to regeneration... they get the same spells as shamans for regen, but
not as soon.  24 vs. 34 for Regeneration, 39 vs. 44  for Chloroplast, 52 vs.
54 for Regrowth.  They don't lag that much further behind at higher levels,
but enough to make a difference at many levels.

  Heh, yeah, druids are fine ninja buffers, they just aren't my favorite
characters to group with. :P
