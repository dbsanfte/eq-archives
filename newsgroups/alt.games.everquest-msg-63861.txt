I hate to tell you this, but feel you should know since I work for a phone
company.  You can call the phone company & find out either:  1) what company
(e.g. AT&T, MCI, Sprint, etc) provides the 800 number & then call them to
find the terminating REAL telephone number (called a POTS line for Plain Old
Telephone Service) or 2) your local phone company might actually be able to
provide the terminating telephone number for you right away.

Just in case this is important, I work for Verizon.  Flame away cause I put
up with bitchy people all day long.
