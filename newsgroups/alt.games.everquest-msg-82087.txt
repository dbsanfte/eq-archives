Ok, then I have the right map :) It certainly does look like a maze. I
haven't dared to go to the interior yet, I usually am running to or from the
Karanas and stick to the left and right wall, respectively. I've heard some
good things about the Maze (except for the stuff my ex said about it). Seems
like, with the info above, I might be able to solo them one at a time, if
they're not casters... are they? nevermind, they prolly are... I bet that
was hilarious, you whacking stuff and dragging it back!

my thanks again, Zymyool
