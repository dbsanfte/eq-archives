_You_ have an internet browser.  An internet browser is not a newsreader, 
although some internet browsers can read news.  There are also many, many 
newsreaders that _cannot_ browse the internet or decipher HTML.  There are 
also many, many computers for which your newsreader/browser of choice is 
not an available option, so don't suggest 'upgrading' to some Microsoft 
piece of shit, please.

We just had this thread.  Where were you?
