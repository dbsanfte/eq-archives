IMO the warrior was just having gate envy.  my ranger went through the
same thing (and now my enchanter is having port envy since i started a
druid).

you definitely did the right thing.  with 5 mobs in the room, your only
form of crowd control being roots and 1/4 of your group and half your
meleers/taunters charmed and beating on YOU, your chances (and therefore
the entire group's chances) of survival were pretty much nil.
