This is one of the temple quests I couldn't think of.  I'll be doing this
one again, for sure.

I used to have one of these, but I don't know what Mana Preservation 2 is.
Mind enlightening me, please?

Friend let me borrow one tonight.  I'll complement it with a crafted item

That zone is probably a little high.  I'll grab 2 PBBs for now while I'm
farming the gorge for plat.

I'd like one of those, but I don't think I can get one right now.

Hrm, never been in Najena.  Had a few great times in Unrest, though.  I'll
look this one up.

I'll look this one up, too.  I know a 56 Ranger who would be willing to
help.

Ah!  This is what I had.  Thanks for the memory jog.

Always wanted some, could never justify the purchase.  I had Kobold hid
boots, but got something better, but can't remember what it was.

Buddy is going to make one of these for me.  Guess I won't need to get a
Crude Stein again.

I've run this quest many many many times.  Amazing I forgot about it.  I'll
run it real fast again.  I'm borrowing an unused GBS for now.

Thanks for the memory jars and the suggestions.  Go grab your Sol Ro gloves
for the heck of it.  You can start a real nice train in Cazic ( unless that
place has changed ) while you're at it.
