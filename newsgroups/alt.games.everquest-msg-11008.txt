I used to see it in Northern Ro all the time. Wasn't so bad when it was fire
beetles, but I remember once, when my ranger was low enough to get great exp
soloing the orcs, I walked up to a friendly little orc and whacked him.
Only, he had four of his friends with him all wrapped up in one orcish
package.

/shout Orcs to EC tunnel!
/yell

Normally when that happens with the orcs, their "idle" movement gets out of
synch and you see this eerie blurring effects as they all shift around. Not
this time.
