I can only speak for Bristlebane, or should I say my experience of it, but I
haven't seen a this happen there. Every scheduled downtime seems to be
announced properly with timers running down with a final message.
That said, the server does seem to fall over anytime the tea lady walks
passed the room.
Maybe they are planned server downtimes and they just hide them as crashes
rather than announce, hell most of BB is so used to it falling over we'd
never realise.

PS. best time to get a Petition answered is after one of these "crashes"
because you know GM's will be monitoring it :ï¿½)
