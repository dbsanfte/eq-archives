I teamed up with a Necromancer the other day. With my regen spell, the necro
keep himself near full mana the entire time by making some kind of pact with
someone (didn't want to find out who). The Necromancer also made what we were
fighting so afriad, they didn't even fight back. And best of all, he had this
little bone guy that beat the crap out of everything. 

The Necromancer and I were killing something every 2 minutes. I would say they
rock. (Don't know what you consider a high level. I was level 45, the necro
was 43 I think. He out-damaged me 2-1.)
