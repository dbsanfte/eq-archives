yes, i ran on just the new sticks

i haven't yet tried running asymetrically ( i heard ddr ram has to always be 
in pairs, but i haven't yet tried doing just 3 sticks instead of 4) .... i 
guess that's something i can do

the MB definitely says it can handle 4gb, but it only lists 400/333/233 (or 
something) for the speeds, and my ram is 500 ... i'm not sure if that's the 
problem

and yes, windows *does* have problems with ram over a certain magic  number, 
but i was really hoping there was some setting somewhere i could change


thanks
