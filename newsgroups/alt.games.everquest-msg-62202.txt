Ram is pretty cheap now a days why would anyone complain about 256mb of ram.
As cheap as ram is and as much as a valuble resource as it is in any machine
everyone should have 512+ of ram. at 59 dollars for a cheap ram upgrade is
its well worth it.  The hardware is a available today at cheaper rates and
developers should take full advantage of that fact.
