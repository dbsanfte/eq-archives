I am on Solsik Ro server.  I'd read on http://eq.castersrealm.com that it is
vender purchased, in both Neriak & Freeport, as well as I believe Cabalis &
a few others.  However, I think it ALSO said research only.  So far I've not
found it in Bazaar, but will keep looking.  Good part is I do already have
my LV34 pet spell (found it for somewhere around 20pp in Bazaar a while
back).
