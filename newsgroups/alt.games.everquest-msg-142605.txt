While I'm a bit fuzzy on the manastone concept, since to my knowledge
they stopped dropping before my server was even created, I believe
they work like this: Faithstone to old world, use manastone to generate
mana by some means (cannalike?  Dunno) then gate back to a hunting
zone.

How does this help me kill anything?  Seems to me it doesn't.  Practically
eliminates downtime between kills, but does not do a damn thing
to help me with an actual kill.  Like having a mod 2 supplier who
insists on remaining in Kaladim, I'd jump at the chance, but wouldn't
consider it helpful for killing any given mob.... well the mod 2 supplier
would at least give me a rod to hold while I gate back.

FT 15, on the other hand, would be better than clarity 2.  With clarity
two, I'm able to kill things I couldn't before, and my down time is
cut markably.  I theorize, then that FT15, combined with the DD
focus  items, would indeed let me kill things I couldn't before, self
buffed, as well as cut my down time between kills.

Would this make me a killing machine?  No, I'd still be unable
to compete with a naked druid or a wizard wearing nothing but
TBoots, but I do think I could give average equipped members
of the non-quadding classes a good run for their money in
the exp per hour race.
