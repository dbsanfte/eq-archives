Biz, I know you aren't going to want to hear this (fuck, I sure as hell 
didnt' want to hear it when it happened to me) but I've had patches 
where I had the latest drivers with my particular hardware combination 
and it didn't work, then I had to go to an *earlier* set of drivers.

Again, I'd suggest wasting the time posting your full specs from system 
analysis (instructions given in a stickied post) in the Sony tech assist 
forum. Often you'll find somebody with the same combo that found some 
half assed driver from six months ago that still works. No assurances, 
of course, but it's free, ya got nothing to lose (since you're scrwed at 
this point anyway) and the drivers are free.

And yes, I can fully fucking believe it. I've gotten shafted by SOE 
multiple times over the years using some VERY mainstream hardware and 
driver combinations.

Let us know how it goes.
