What level is this place anyway? I'm lvl 30 now and would like to see some
more dungeons.

Wonder which ones these are.

Great, first had to redo my /assist messages on all chars and now they tell
me the old ones still work.

I don't have many people on my ignore list (yet), but I can see how it could
have been a problem. Good fix imo.

GOOD! Finally I can get a sort of overview of the 20+ different words I keep
in the bank. I was wondering if I should made a screenshot of every opened
bag, print it out and then write the names of each word on it. No more!
Thank you Verant.

And the loot mode name-pop would be handy as well. Especially when you're
hunting for GLS or animal pelts.

wasn't this implemented yet? I know my hotkey does a "/who all 'GUILD' " and
gives me all players of my guild everywhere already.

I know of some more extensions usefull for the /who command, especially this
one:
/who "ZONE: zonename"

Riiight. anyone going to use this one??

Not to be picky, but why this change? why not simply increasing the weight
of the current(/previous) large tailoring kit? Now you have 4 different
ones.

Oh well, my large tailoring kit will now become more rare when time passes.
"/auc WTS 10 slots with only 3 weight!! Great for monks! 200pp"
