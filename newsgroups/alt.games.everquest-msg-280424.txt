	Ha ha, that means you're not pulling fast enough :-)

	All kidding aside, if the puller's doing exactly right my mana
goes sllllooowwwwly down and then at like 20% we run out of mobs... I
sometimes melee on the way into a raid (while clearing to target) but
wouldn't think about meleeing a raid target...

	I *do* solo, undead in ME, stuff like that...  And I play paladin
in chanter/cleric or chanter/necro duos.  (More DPS and more fun if I
tank and heal myself rather than just healing pet...)  The new damage
shield spells are a godsend for clerics, although since we get plate
we should also get dual wield! :-)

	And invis.

	And better stuns.

	And you shouldn't need peridots all the time either.  Oh, wait... :-)
