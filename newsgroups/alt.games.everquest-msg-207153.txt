From the shadows, the mysterious Dennis Francis Heffernan
<hefferman@comcast.net> (if that IS his real name) conspiratorially
whispered:

Well, Mr Heffernan (if that IS your real name!), UO and EQ both had
people very experienced in MUDs and that experience didn't seem to
translate over at all. Seems MUDs don't really help much when it comes
to mmorpgs - the expectations are different, the playerbase is
different.

Well its a bit early to say so, I think. There's quite a bit of
evidence to suggest those most unhappy with SWG never would have been
happy in such a game in the first place. Koster may yet be vindicated.

Key point - it's not those guys anymore.
