i think that's what the OP was asking for.

short answer: there are arbitrary items that have a minimum modified skill
requirement to attempt the combine.

to answer the question more thoroughly:
there are certain items, mostly PoP tradeskill items, that have a high
trivial but don't actually cost that much to make (compared to "traditional"
skillup items).  to prevent people from "powerskilling" on these items, SOE
put in a minimum required modified skill (ie: you have a geerlok that gives
you a 5% mod to your skill, so your modified skill at 212 would be something
like 222) in order to even attempt combining.  in some cases, the minimum
skill for the combine is greater than that of the trivial point for the
combine (this is the case with most of the subcombines in PoP: ethereal
swatches, ethereal chain, etc).

you can get around it with sufficient modification to your skill (ie: +15%
tailoring shears that drop in akheva, +15% smithing hammer that drops in
ssra), but these generally require a pretty heavy raiding force and are no
drop.  from everything i've heard, skill mod items do NOT stack.  so having
3 geerloks (impossible, but just for the sake of argument) equipped would
still only give a 5% mod.
