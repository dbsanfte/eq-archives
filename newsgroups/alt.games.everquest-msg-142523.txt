Heh this is why I am bothering to argue with you :p You and kaev both think
I am just spouting a party line without thought( thoughtless wasnt it? :) .I
was born a democrat , I became a republican for awhile , I got older and
became a Libertarian. This process took 20 years of HARD thought and was by
no means easy or without a good deal of research into economics and history.

You care , and that is good. But you are being manipulated by your feelings
for an evil result. It is not enough to write the check and feel good about
it. You must follow through and see what they do with the money.

So few people realize that the first republican president was Abraham
Lincon, or that the civil rights of blacks where passed by republicans over
democratic resistance.
