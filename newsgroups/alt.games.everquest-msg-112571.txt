  Well, I guess that's why it's called it the "roleplay preferred" server
and not the "uber preferred" server.  Besides, people have managed to pull
off joint good/neutral/evil raids already, and I'm pretty sure the main uber
guild on the server is evil-neutral (which makes sense, between evils and
neutrals you have all the classes covered except paladins, but what do you
want on your uber raid, corpse summoning capability, or 10% exp rezzes? :P).
That said I think that they should've made Summon Corpse an exception to the
"no beneficial spells" rule on the server, it's just too major a
disadvantage to being Good.

  More languages don't become available as you level up from your trainers,
but you can visit trainers in different cities who have different languages
available.

  But, yeah, the language learning rate was way to slow, but I would've
preferred a compromise to begin with, with a drastically increased chance of
getting a skillup and lowering the 1 skillup per (time period) limit way
down from 60 minutes.
