I don't think anyone is disputing that WoW has a much shorter advancement
grind.  Less time played to reach max level.   I think the question is if that
shorter grind translates directly into less hours played per week.

Certainly the game can be played more casually... but are most people actually
playing it that way?

(Yes, that is not a rethorical question.   I can see arguments each way.
Curious about what others have seen.)

"We need a new Mario game, where you rescue the princess in the first ten
minutes, and for the rest of the game you try and push down that sick feeling
in your stomach that she's "damaged goods"... When Peach asks you, in the
quiet of her mushroom castle bedroom "do you still love me?" you pretend to be
asleep. You press the A button rhythmically, to control your breath, keep it
even." - Joey Comeau on increased realism in gaming.
