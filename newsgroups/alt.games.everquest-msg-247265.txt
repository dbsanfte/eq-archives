Is a level 65 that much more powerful than a level 60? I mean, at 58 (druid)
I am still not that much more powerful than at 53. Admittedly, I don't have
aa's or great gear which i guess most 65's would have.

If the progression in power to lv70 from 65 is equivalent to the leap from
60 to 65, then would people really be capable of killing veks solo, or all
the mobs of PoJ if in a group? PoD might be a little amitious but having
only fought the underbulks there, I couldn't say I know the mobs very well.
