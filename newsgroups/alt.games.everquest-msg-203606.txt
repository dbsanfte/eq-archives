Sony hasn't stopped soloing. Just reduced the solo exp amount. Probably to
encourage the groupign aspect of the game. If you want to solo and play a
class that can solo then you can still go and solo. I solo in Halls of
Honour still but also group any guildmates who are LFG to give them exp. No
skin off my nose. I can still make more exp soloing than grouped.
