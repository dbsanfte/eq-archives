Hello

I have killed goblins in stillmoon, and then I have looted blood from 
lavaspinners.
Have still to collect 5 teeth from Tirranums Delve (burning arrows)

But im not sure if Im heading in the right direction.
Is the only entrance off Lavaspinners Lair?
Because if it is, its a pain, cos that means I have to kill my way through 
LS just to get to the tirranuns delve? Cos iirc the stone dervishes see my 
invis.

Or am I missing something?

I have also killed Gimblax, so i think once I loot 5 teeth, i should get my 
3 AAs??
