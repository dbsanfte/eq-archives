I assume it's because they feel that soloers are antisocial and thus 
won't make friends and thus won't keep paying the monthly fee as long as 
a constant grouper and (theoretically) more social player.

For me... if it weren't for the people to chat with either in-game (via 
the chat system) or out of game (on message boards), I probably would 
have quit EQ long ago.  This would support the statement above except I 
almost always hunt solo.  There's a certain freedom in knowing that you 
have only yourself to depend upon and only yourself to hurt if you screw 
up and things go to hell.

If only pure melee classes (I don't like spells) could solo reasonably 
well... meh.  I'm having no trouble right *now*, of course, but my Iksar 
monk is only level 13.

Oddly enough, I find myself somewhat tempted by the bard class.  The 
"feel" of a bard, from a roleplay/persona perspective, is neat and they 
have great utility.  But the sheer complexity of the class is... 
daunting.  Song twisting I can do (I experimented with a bard some 
months back, getting it to level 10, and was able to keep up 3 songs 
consistantly, barring stuns or fizzles), but then you get into 
*instrument* twisting... yipe.  I could ignore instrument twisting, of 
course, but wouldn't I be a sucky bard if I did?

Ah, EQ.  I love you so.  But you piss me off, too.  =)
