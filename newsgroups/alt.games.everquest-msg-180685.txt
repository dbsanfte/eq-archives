As others have said it is 1 HP per 4 skill points.

With that, it is a GREAT skill, for everyone. My favorite trick with
bind wounds deals with +HP items. Here is how it works. Let's say you
have two Platinum Fire Wedding Rings (+110 HP). Now lets say you have
base HP of 300. Let's say you just finished a fight. Your buffed HP is
410. You lost 190 HP, down to 220. First, take off your HP rings, that
drops your HP down to 110, and max HP to 300. Bind wounds up to or
above 150, then put on your rings again. Let's say you get to 155 with
bind, put the rings back on and you are at 265 out of 410. If you
hadn't taken off the rings, you wouldn't be able to bind wounds
normally(220/410 = 53%), after taking off the rings you are at 110/330
= 33%, then after binding you are 265/410 = 64%. The more HP gear you
have the better. My 14th level monk has 171 points in HP gear. His
base HP is 336 or so. I can bind close to 80% with this trick.

Be very careful when taking off the gear, you can kill yourself.
