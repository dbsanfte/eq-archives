www.eqtraders.com is THE site for tradeskill information. Read the information
on the site and the boards and you'll have a good idea what to expect from the
different disciplines and what might be right for you.

Some steady income can be had at low levels by making "intermediate" goods -
e.g., leather padding, heady kiolas. However, any tradeskill will cost quite a
bit to get to high levels.

One way to get started would be to make Fetid Essence: 1 Fishing Grub + 1 Water
Flask in a brew barrel. This trivials at 122 but you really only need to get 60
or so. Both ingredients can be found on vendors and are VERY inexpensive. Then,
start making Heady Kiolas: 2 Kiola Sap (unstacked), 1 Water Flask, 1 Bottle in a
brew barrel. These trivial at 46, and you want them to be trivial before you
start making them to minimize the number of failures. Sell these for 2pp each in
the Bazaar (tailors need them) and use the proceeds to fund other tradeskills.
