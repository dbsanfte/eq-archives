I can't remember ... probably because I didn't pay attention ;-) ... was
Lanys no-transfer?

No chat?  Yuk.  Staring at the book was bad enough.

Y'know, there's a reason I used Orc 1 as an example.  I took a small group
to Orc 1 a couple of weeks ago ... a 14 chanter (mine), a 16 troll SK, and a
13 dwarf cleric ... expecting to own the place.  We were moderately twinked
... okay, so the troll was in a full suit of Sentient.  And you know what?
We got our butts handed to us.  I think they've juiced up the orc camps now
that the bazaar is established and folks actually hunt in EC.

Though I have no doubt that folks will be arguing over the Orcs, NRo Dervs,
Auqa Gobs, and Chessboard, though.
