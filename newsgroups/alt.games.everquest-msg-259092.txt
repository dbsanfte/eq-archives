Buying a new fan for the gf4 is not an option? I'd have thought you'd be 
able to get one for 15-20 bucks. Might be worth sourcing one to use in a 
2ndary pc, or as a gift to a technologically challenged friend...

That said, there is nothing wrong with upgrading, and as long as you get 
something fairly state-of-the-art you'll be happy. Many of the AGP 8x 
capable cards will run just fine on an AGP 4x system, but check first.

Brands to stay away from? None really... you're really either looking at 
ati or nvidia and in virtually all cases you can use the reference 
drivers if there is a dysfunction with the manufacturer. I tend to 
select a brand based on the bundled software (games) more than anything 
else, provided it meets all the tech specs I want. (dual monitor 
support, ram, etc...)

As far as video ram goes, don't sweat it. There are no games that use 
the extra ram on the 'biggest cards', and by the time a game does use 
it, we'll probably be running directx 10 so you'll need a new video card 
anyway if you really want to get the most out of it.

Happy shopping :)
