  Well, to be fair, I can't think of any game that has upgraded 
so that you were not able to play it on the system you 
originally bought. Some would say that the price of admission 
was paid... when EQ was originally bought, and that raising 
the system requirements is tacky. 

  When Tribes was 'upgraded' to Tribes2, the game were two 
distinctly different games: you could play either, both. 
With this upgrade, Verant has said "you know those original 
system requirements? Uh, sorry."

  I can't think of any other game that has upgraded itself 
from RAM reqs, OS reqs, video card reqs, etc. for an 
expansion so drastically. However, it is really no 
different than Microsoft's OS releases: each new 
one is slower and requires more resources than the 
last. And all the lemmings flock to it. :)

  Shadows of Luclin should have been a separate game: the 
folks who wish to play it could, and those who were quite 
happy with EQ as it was would be happy. 

  Anyhow, that's water under the bridge. What's done is done. 
Persistant world games may have to follow this method.
