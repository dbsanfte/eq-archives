Hmm. Funny that the original official class description of the monk said
that the class was as useful solo as it was grouping. Still, perhaps
Brenlo's comments are retrospective? Perhaps his mastery of spacetime causes
this not only to be the case now, but to have always been the case, and
anyone who remembers differently, or has manuals that contain contradictory
testimony is just a whining twit. And people who raise the fact at
conventions with SOE are also whining twits, especially when we promise to
give them solo ldon's to shut them up, and they have the gall to notice that
this still hasn't been implemented by the time of the next convention.

Consider my ass kicked. Right out of EQ1.  I'll give EQ2 a go, but since the
release of kunark, I was running 2 accounts, and bought each expansion for
those accounts, and i thought everquest was about fun. Fun fighting,
exploring, crafting, talking to npc's, raiding, helping out a stranger... if
Brenlo thinks EQ is about grouping, well, maybe he should play football or
something where grouping is unavoidable.

Heck, i remember the original review of EQ going on about the joy of simply
fishing. Was that about grouping? Very few quests are group activities,
perhaps Brenlo should just rename the game Evergroup. Then again, the quests
in EQ are now mostly irrelevant, and the core remaining are moving more to
raiders only so perhaps he is right...
