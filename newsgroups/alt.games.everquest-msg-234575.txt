This is pretty much total bs. I've been running a magician since the first
month the game came out. From the time you are in your teens, a magician
learns to keep aggro on the pet if you want to survive.

I've also run up a necro and a chanter, same thing.

Look, there is NO difference between using a pet as a tank or a warrior. If
there is a cleric in the group to heal the warrior, all the better. If there
is a druid in the group to tack on a damage shield, all the better.

For example, what you are trying to say with that somehow when a soloing
magician gets in a group and uses a warrior for example in a group, they
suddenly get stupid and forget everything they have learned to that point.
That is one of the silliest things I have ever seen pass for common
knowledge in this group.

This newsgroup seems to suck more now then it has in the past. Close minded
group think. 'My way is the only way!' with a dozen people parroting the
response.

I think it was that Frank E idiot who said 'you can't be right because there
are people that have been in the game and newsgroup much longer then you'
When it was pointed out that I have been in the game and newsgroup as long
as anybody he said he kill filled. Now I see the same idiot responding to me
here.

Ben Sisson had the same problem when he tried becoming active in the
newsgroup.

I'm gone.
