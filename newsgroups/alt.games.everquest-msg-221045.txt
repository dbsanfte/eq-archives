Yes.  They can now nuke four times during your average fight, instead of
two.   The problem is that they've become lazy.  Instead of spacing out the
four nukes, they just chain nuke four times, then sit down and go afk for
the rest of the fight.  With knight level aggro control, you can get away
with that.  So they do it.  Then they try it with a warrior tanking, get
killed after the 4'th chain nuke, then scream OMG, Warriors are such awful
tanks!.

With the exception of monks, I've yet to see this be the actual case.   And
yes, I think it's ok to have one class that warriors dont' really group well
with.
