Whoah cool.. so I guess qeynos was the only missing one. This is nice
;) Binding in FV starting at 19 would work nicely then ( I think lev
is at 19)  I already have ocean route maps of timorous.. ;)

Of course I'd have to avoid the timorous regular fayd (or is it
usually killed by some npc... i forget the lore of long ago before
druids could spawn him) By the way, is that fayd on ring of scale like
gorenaire???? If so just doing mistmore for a while at 19  would fix
that.
