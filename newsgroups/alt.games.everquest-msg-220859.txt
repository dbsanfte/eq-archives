	No, I'm going to know when he was killed last and get there as he's about
to spawn.

	That's nice, but you could still do it without Tracking.  Does the
customary method of AEing significant portions of the zone to force respawns
work?

	Again, I expect raiding guilds to know when choice targets are likely to
be up.

|How do you define extraordinary effort?  Enough of an effort that *no
|one* ever does it?  

	Does no one ever do it simply because they don't have to?

|actually making this "non-extraordinary effort".

	There's no accounting for laziness.
