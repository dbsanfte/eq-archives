Must be agnostic, my dark elf cleric of innoruuk is quite KOS by
default. Her faction is threaten or scowl with any of them.

The point is, its goofy for them to be selling them when the druid
doing the porting could not buy from the vendors in sro AND would not
be porting to surefall right amongst some high level druids in the
guild there unless he was non kos in which case he'd buy the rings in
surefall (or in gfay)

I guess the only convenience would be if a druid knew the spells were
sold there and was with an evil buddy in sro and had not bought them
yet.
