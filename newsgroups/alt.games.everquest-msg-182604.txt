Hey, it is a componentless buff that is *not* self-only.  That's news for
Wizards.  For those who don't play Wizards, here's the buffs we can cast on
others (from memory, so maybe I've skipped one or two):

    1. Invisibility
    2. See invisible
    3. Levitate (requires bat wing)
    4. O'Keils {radiation|embers|something else} (small damage shield, and
    increases fire resistance)

The rest of our buffs (infravison, ultravision, HP, AC, magic resist, cold
resist, better fire resist than O'Keils, damage absorption, mana
regeneration) are all self-only.
