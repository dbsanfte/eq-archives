In my brief sojourn on Sullon Zek, I made it to level 3 in QH with a good
half elf druid.  During that time, the goods and neutrals were having an all
out pitched battle for control of BB.  The goods had control of it, and were
blocking the neutrals from entering at the zone from QH.  When I left, the
neutrals seemed to be making headway in getting into BB.  So, I don't think,
given this type of behavior, I don't see the balance of power shifting
anytime soon.  I believe that my next sojourn into PvP will be one of the
other less populated servers, but for now, I am content to continue playing
on EMarr.
