All we ever know about people is the face they put on for the public.

My best friend in junior high and high school is someone I want to have
nothing to do with now - a few years after graduation he raped a woman.

Obviously he wasn't who I thought he was, despite the fact that for 6
years I considered him one of my 2 closest friends.

I don't believe this is true.  Most people put on a public persona -
the person they want you to think they are.

I'd be much more cautious with RL friendships personally, they have far
more power to hurt you if your trust is misplaced.
