You're right in that much of the tribute isn't really bug-eyed
wow-gotta-have-it kind of stuff.  Mostly it allows you to overcome equipment
shortcomings - if you don't have an item that has spell haste, you can use
tribute, if you don't have a buff extender, you can use tribute, etc.  If
you have all the necessary focus effects then yeah, not a lot that's useful.

The one and only tribute I have turned on is the extra hitpoints.  Hitpoints
are *always* good.  =)  I get an extra 150 hitpoints, which only costs me 21
tribute points every ten minutes.  A bargain.  And since Heraldic armor is
good tribute and I'm a GM smith, I can very easily keep tribute points
flowing without spending a lot.
