Prior to the change, I was getting quite fed up with my Sage, impossible 
to skill up, as it cost way too much money to buy the subcomponents I 
needed in order to do combines for spells that I have to sell at a loss, 
if I can move them at all.  With the change, I will have to see what it 
costs for me to make the subcombines now, and figure out if I can 
continue to be a Sage, or if I just have to give it up entirely, and 
stick with provisioning, which was hit the least by this new change, and 
actually was promoted by the enhanced value of food/drink now.

I tried making deals with other tradeskillers to swap spells for 
quills/paper, but, the sheer number of those components I need to 
actually advance my skill is staggering, and you just cannot do enough 
trades for the quantities you need.  I tried doing the same for the 
paper/thread for patterns, but, the xp from making those dries up pretty 
fast as you level.  This meant that barring pouring huge sums of cash 
into it, being a Sage was worthless.  I will check what the cost is now 
for me to make the subcombines, and see what other tradeskillers are 
selling them for, and reevaluate whether or not being a Sage is viable or 
not now.  For now, I use my Sage as someone to make patterns for guildies 
when they supply me with the subcomponents, and nothing more, as my 
ability to advance in levels is practically nil right now.

One thing I would really like to see is the ability to change my 
specialty, I would not mind losing my current skills in order to do it, 
but it sucks that you are stuck with a bad choice, when you don't really 
know enough when making that choice to begin with.
