    Thing is, monks are much cheaper to outfit than a warrior, so they have
better stuff relative to what's out there. My 35 IKS MNK has 770 AC, and I
doubt anything he has other than the Frog Crown is considered "expensive".
My WAR has full crafted/FS plate in non-visible slots, total AC suit, and
she'll be lucky to hit 770 AC at 35.
