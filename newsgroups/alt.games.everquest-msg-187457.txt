It's not so restrictive anymore since they did away with most of the 
original ruleset.  There's still no "Common" but it's fairly trivial to 
learn other languages (or so I've been told).  All the alignment stuff 
is gone, for example.

The community's pretty nice, too, IMO, and their board 
(http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie) is quite active.
