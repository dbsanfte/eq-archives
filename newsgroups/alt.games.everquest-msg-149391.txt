Playing only 1 song.

Over healing like Casting CH on casters.
Healing the puller just as he brings in a pull.

> Druid:
> - No snare on target in agro enviroment

Not keeping Regen and Damage shield on the MT at all times.
Not healing the cleric and enchanter.
Not keeping resists up when there are casters being pulled.
Meleeing.
Not keeping sow up when in the outdoors.
Not having Evac up when required or a crucible of escape.

I tried this with my monk several times. Most
clerics ignore it and heal me anyway. Even after I tell them "Look I get
a free 25% heal every 6 minutes, stop wasting your mana."

> Necromancer:

Over casting and drawing agro when they are not the MT.

> Rouge:

>
> SK:

> Shaman:

> Warrior:

Not choosing targets fast enough when MT and there are several.

This goes for every caster. I can't count the number of times
I have pulled a mob and I see a spell going off on it in the 1st
5 seconds of battle.

Other general DON'TS:

1. Don't go afk with out informing the group/raid.

2. Don't use any kind of fear or blind spell in a dungeon or
where any mobs are close.

3. Don't use an AE spell unless its the plan and the enchanter
knows you are casting it.

4. When in a dungeon. DON'T wander. I know you want to see
what's around that corner. Don't peek you won't like it.

5. If you get a mob on you and you are not the MT then DON'T
run around like a chicken with your head cut off. You'll only die faster.
The main tank will get it off you or the chanter/bard will mez or charm
it.

General Dos:

1. If something is not working: CHANGE your tactics.
I can't tell you how many time I see people  beat their heads into
walls when a simple change in tactics can make all the difference.

2. Root! Its a great spell have it memmed and USE it. Almost every
casting class has it. Not everything can be mezzed and when the shit
hits the fan this spell can save you. Sometimes the chanter dies.
