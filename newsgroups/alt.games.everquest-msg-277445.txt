A guild lobby corpse summon you can do immediately after you die and
get a rez (as long as it's within the regular time limit.) Shadowrest
isn't really a corpse summons as much as it's a place where your corpse
will go after a week instead of poofing into oblivion.

So, difference is: faster time in which you can retrieve your corpse
and ability to rez (within limits.)
