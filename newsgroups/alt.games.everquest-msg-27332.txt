Your right in that, but it can stil bother me if a guy is absolutely clueless to
what hes doing. I mean, if i buy a game like EQ, i do at least a minimum of
research of the game, and of the char i wanna play.

Last time i was in GFay i got a request from a level 12 dwarf warrior who wanted
a port to Everfrost.
I am of course puzzled to what anyone besides barbarians want to do in
Everfrost, especially at that level, so ask him why he wanna go there.
He the tells me that his friend told him it was a good place to solo.
Now im of course really puzzled, never heard of a level 12 warrior who wanna
solo, especially not one that wanna solo in one of the zones in the old world
that it takes the longest to get to. So i inform him that he might be a wrong
there, give hime some advice on where to hunt as a level 12, and tell him a
little about the general role for a warrior.
Then i get the following tell "Thanx for spoiling my fun".
Am of course REALLY puzzled now, since he is appearantly not only clueless to
EQ, roleplay in general (wanna solo with a warrior), but also ungrateful over
for help.
So i tell him that if he wanna solo, he should maybe try one of the classes more
suited for soloing, like a druid or a necro.
Then he again ask me to port him to Everfrost.

Was SOOOO close to porting him to NK, and telling him where to run to get to
Everfrost, then go invis and follow him, just to see what would happen.
