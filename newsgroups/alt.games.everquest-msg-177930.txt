Nah, none below 10gig on that machine.  Yes, one helluva MP3 collection - 
gets a drive of its own ( /home/mp3 mount ).  The sad part is most of the 
collection was obtained before all the peer-2-peer crap came out.  It's a 
hard-earned [ tongue-in-cheek ] MP3 collection!  We didn't have it so good 
those years ago.  Kids these days get everything handed to them, no work 
involved!

The ones under 10gig go in the wife's machine =)

While we're on the subject ( not ), do any of you have an extra power cord 
to an old Surestor DAT drive?  I inherited one, but it didn't have the non-
standard power cord with it.
