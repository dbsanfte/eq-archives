Because you're level 55.  :P

The noobs aren't doing 40 dps.  :P

Inflated expectations.

No, there are other level 55 monks out there.  :P

Your monk isn't level 60, why do you torture yourself trying to compare to a
level 60?

Yeah, you're freaking missing BEING LEVEL 60!

All other things aren't equal.  A level 60 monk with only 22% haste is
slacking.  You don't mention having your epic, which even at level 55 means
you're slacking.  Add that onto the A) better damage table, and B) triple
attack, and you don't have to stretch your mind too much to see the 30 dps
you're missing as a slacker 55 monk.  :P

> my monk is broken

Your brain is broken.  :P
