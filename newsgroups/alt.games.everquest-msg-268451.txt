Here is a cut and paste from www.webster.com

Please note definition numbers 6 and 7, they have more to do with reading 
than with speaking.

Main Entry: 1dumb
Pronunciation: 'd&m
Function: adjective
Etymology: Middle English, from Old English; akin to Old High German tumb 
mute
1 a : lacking the human power of speech <dumb animals> b of a person, often 
offensive : lacking the ability to speak
2 : temporarily unable to speak (as from shock or astonishment) <struck dumb 
with fear>
3 : not expressed in uttered words <dumb grief>
4 : SILENT; also : TACITURN
5 : lacking some usual attribute or accompaniment; especially : having no 
means of self-propulsion <a dumb barge>
6 a : lacking intelligence : STUPID b : showing a lack of intelligence 
<asking dumb questions> c : requiring no intelligence <dumb luck>
7 : not having the capability to process data <a dumb terminal> -- compare 
INTELLIGENT 3a

- dumb�ness noun
usage There is evidence that, when applied to persons who cannot speak, dumb 
has come to be considered offensive.
