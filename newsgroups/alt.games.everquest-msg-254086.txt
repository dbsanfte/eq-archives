I've never been there with a character higher than 56.  Most of the
time I've spent there was while leveling a Druid through his 40s
and into the low 50s.  I started spending time there around 42 when
the XP in Kaesora went to hell (conveniently getting me my 44 heal
not long after I dinged the level).
