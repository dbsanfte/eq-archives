Yes but donations isnt just tipping, its got elements of offering what its
worth to you....frankly I dont run KEi on my main because it aint worth
paying anything for it for me - I fear kite solo for xp and frankly its a
gimps game and I never run out of mana - to me the buff is worth about a
stack of summoned X. SO why should someone be annoyed if thats what I
offer for it? OK I wouldnt personally do that , Id explain the situation
or simply not bother most likely  but I can see why people might offer
this OK you will undoubtedly have specific examples as to why this wasnt
the case in X Y or Z but thats the next point I cover discussing what
happens when the system is used by those on the scrounge when they
dont need to be....

If you offer donations as I said some people will take advantage
thats the nature of asking for donations - you make it voluntary to the
person: That exposes you to the vagaries of humanity ie those who are
looking for it cheap or are too cheap to spend cash...if you dont want
that then you sell it.

My personal peeve in this game is people offering stuff out on a donation
basis and then ranting about the donation - I've had abuse hurled at me
for only giving an 8pp donation for a port because the 'going rate for a
port is 10pp' - this on a cloth amroured lvl 6 alt and that was ALL the
chracters money

Because donations are a voluntary offered thing, its a hope not an
expectation or a requirement. It assumes in most cases (ie charities)
that a fair number of people may take up the offer and give nothing. If
you (in the collective sense here, not you specifically) dont want to do
that on a donation basis dont ask for donations - ask for a price.

As I said I have no problem with anyone selling anything, its up front and
honest - I feel there are too many people trying to con people into
parting with cash by using the word donation and meaning 'Im selling...'
If I dont want to buy from someone, I get that option. If I used KEI I
would probably be far more likely becuase of the abuse by vendors of the
'donation' line to come buy one of you for your 50pp than run the risk of
the 'donations' dude getting up tight and hassling me in tells or ooc.
