No body wants summoned items. Too much of a pain to track down
a mage, swap the item out, then have it poof when you log and switch
normal item back in.

Items with permanent effects are another story. No hassle.

Summoned items are great for mages because they can get them
whenever they want them.

Plus 90% of the people that play the game either don't understand
focus items, haven't heard what they can do or don't care.

Even in my own exp I try to give items away and people say "but then
I'd have to take off my +5int item?" Let's see you are going to increase
your mana pool by 50 instead of saving 2000 mana over the course of
the night. Uh yeah ok whatever.
