    The difference is how far ahead a SK can get in aggro. A SK can Taunt
(get even with me in aggro), quick DoT/debuff (vault ahead of me in aggro),
then swing his weapon. If I ever go ahead of him in aggro, he can *on
demand* cast a quick DoT/debuff to get back ahead of me. When I play my
warrior, I can only get even with the highest aggro person - I cannot vault
past them. And I must wait for Taunt to cycle to do it. So when I play my
rogue and fail a few Evades in a row, a warrior can only get it off me for a
short time until I Evade or turn off autoattack and back away. A SK can at
worst ping-pong it a bit, and usually keeps it off me until I Evade
successfully. I have seen one warrior who can hold aggro at will with me and
with a RB/Seb Croaking Dirk rogue, but he has a Twisted Steel Bastard Sword.
Presumably when you say "well equipped" you don't mean "has a NToV weapon".

    ( As an aside, that weapon of his is just awe-inspiring. Seeing 400
point crits and 800 point crips from a non-Warlord seems to really humble
the nukers. And the one time he used Aggressive while berserk and fully
hasted, well, he splatted a Velk's spider in seconds.)

    The ability to generate large amounts of aggro when required. A warrior
is limited by Taunt cycling, and by the randomness of whatever
aggro-inducing procs they have.
