   Thank you.  I like to think that my posts are worth reading.  It's
nice to get some independent confirmation that that might be so.

Agreed.  I especially like his writings since he is a much higher level
cleric and I am, and I've gotten some good advice from reading his stuff
over.  Also, I like the Chimp posts as mentioned further down in this
thread.  And my oddball favorite, if I had to say, is Biz.  A bit
nastier sometimes than the occasion IMO warrants, he writes with a
clear, consistent style that is oftentimes entertaining.
