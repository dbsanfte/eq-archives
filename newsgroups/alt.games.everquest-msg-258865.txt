I don't think there are any bard instrument quests at that low level,
except for the Vah Shir ones.

As for dropped instruments:

Drums: Mistmoore Battle Drums, or Stretched Skin Drum should be
possible for a group of mid-to-high-30s, but it's probably easier to
just get 100pp to buy them in the bazaar.

Strings: Combine Lute or Combine Mandolin, vendor bought in Katta
Castellum, there is nothing dropped that you can do that's as good.
If you really don't want to pay money (50ish pp), you can get one in
Mistmoore.

Brass: Torin's Horn from Torin in Echo Caverns, or a Combine Horn from
Katta Castellum.

Wind: modifier doesn't matter, just get a wooden flute.

You can also start saving up for LDoN instruments, and while you do
that you might get lucky and have an instrument from a named.
