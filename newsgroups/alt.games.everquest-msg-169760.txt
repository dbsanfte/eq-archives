My monk was soloing drolvargs pre-nerf. Nerf came, and he had to group. I'm
52 and i don't know if I'd now be tough enough to solo again, but I don't
think I'd bother.

 I'm really happy for the monks who weren't affected, but I was, and my
enjoyment of the game has been down ever since. I definitely don't enjoy
having the character I spent so much time on crippled by a rule change that
was intended to affect raiding monks (which failed from what I hear, but
since I've never raided, I don't know, but it would be nice to have my
toughness magically restored by virtue simply of me being on a raid.)

I play other characters, like a druid, 2 warriors, necromancer, mage, cleric
and rogue, but none have given me the thrill my monk gave me pre-nerf, and
when everquest finishes (about 1 year from now?) I can't see me getting
involved in another game like this, simply because you are too vulnerable to
the whims of the people running the show.
