I keep three heals memmed at all times and they are hotkeyed. 

At 39, I kept 2 heals memmed and had them hotkeyed. Have the Sup and
have the Greater for now. Use Greater for casters, and if someone is
dying *fast*, because it casts faster than Sup.

At your level, CHeal takes a very long time for what little your tank
needs healing. I'd set it aside, and drag it back out around 44 or so,
or if you tank is level 45 or greater. Then you'll want three buttons:
Cheal, Greater heal, and Celestial heal.

Use Greater for casters, and for Need a Heal NOW situations.
Use Celestial for a lighter tank heal, or great for a hard pull (so he
regens all the damage while pulling).
Use CHeal for the mana efficiency- let him get down to two bubbles or a
hair under so he goes into a berserker frenzy & CHeal him back up to
full. Cheals are very mana efficient when the tank has more than 3K hp.

When the casters get to level 50, you may want to switch to Sup for the
casters, or Remedy when you get there.

Hope this helps,

Healing for group heals, and terrified of when I'll need to use Word of
Vigor (group CHeal)
