I hunted from 10 to 14 so far in NK, not sure what the zone is like through
the day in the USA, but when I hunt there, (uk player) its usually almost
empty, and those beetle's are fantastic exp right up till lvl 19, did my
druid there, was a blast.

Good luck hunting in the dungeons....   can sometimes be a real pain having
a pet in a dungeon, necro wish list item number one for dungeon hunting
...ROOT!
