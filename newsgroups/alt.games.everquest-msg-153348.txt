Your first character is always your hardest. But after I leveled one
character to 55, I started on my current favorite, a dark elf necro. I
remembered taking an untwinked character to the Orc camps in EC and having
my butt handed to me (13 wood elf warrior), but when a guildie (Klowdee, 10
troll shaman) asked me to come to Orc 2 and help her break the camp, I took
my level 10 self over. As an INT caster, I usually have the armor class of
goat cheese, and most level 10 casters are still wearing raw silk armor. I
had twinked myself with an Oracle Robe, various loam pieces from drops in
the Hole, and a couple of other nice things. Klowdee was her second troll
too. So we didn't ask a higher level person to come break the camp for us,
or shout for others to join in... we just zergling rushed the place. I ended
up being the tank while my pet took one orc at a time and Klowdee took
another. It was a great feeling of power to withstand all those blows.
