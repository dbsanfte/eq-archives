Yup, my rogue has ad a bit of trouble finding groups.  Or rather, it's 
been -much- easier to find an enchanter to buff the heck out of him... :)

}Of course if you're doing that, your *defense* skills can lag quite far 
}behind...

Mmm, that could be a good point.  Either way, both of those can be fixed 
fairly easily by either (a) grouping more or (b) grouping less, and 
training points are in limited supply.  I'd probably learn orcish. :)
