   Always good to hear.

    I've seen bad behavior on every server I've ever played for any length
of time.  Less of it on FV, to be sure, but I did see it.  Maybe I'm just
lucky, hang out in griefer magnet zones, or have a better eye or memory for
that sort of thing, I dunno.  I'm not saying that I've seen it every time I
played, in fact the incidents were usually well spread out.  But it did
leave me with the idea that there will always be griefers in any MMO game,
and they will be working hard to defeat ingame mechanisms to defeat them.
