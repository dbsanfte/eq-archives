    I think you're underestimating how this will change the nature of
pricing. How did you decide what to sell your stuff for before? Look at
prices, see what it's selling for. So now, when someone does a search on
their stuff as a "price check", they'll see the lowballer. And there'll be
more pressure to lower price to either compete directly with the lowballer,
or to set an "intermediate price" between the lowball price and the average
price to speed up sales.
