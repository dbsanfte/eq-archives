They long ago decided that it was not feasable to deal with this in the
AI.  EQ's mob AI is very simplistic, any resemblance to intelligence is
either coincidence or a bit of cleverness with smoke and mirrors (or
both).  If you consider how many mobs are out there on each server (they
outnumber the player characters by a goodly margin) you can see why they
simply do not have the computational resources to make the mobs smart
enough to cope with buildings (or even doorways right next to the mob's
path, it would seem).  And if they did it would open up all sorts of
possible exploits, all of which are eliminated from consideration by
simply letting the mobs move/attack thru walls (players can attack thru
the walls, but cannot move thru them).  In dungeons, walls restrict mobs
more, tho they do still attack thru doors and cast spells thru walls.
