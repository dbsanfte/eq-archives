Not at all.  You're just narrowing the definition too much.

Not at all.  If Hitler had just made nice with the Russians for four
years, all of Europe could have been his.  After Europe fell, THEN he
could have attacked Russia and stood a chance.  I'm not talking about
peaceful coexistence, I'm talking about picking your fights a using
sound strategy.  

Nature appreciates subtlety.  Brute force will only get you so far.
