Again with the term, "quasi-legal". SoE shut them down when they were 
operating under the name Winter's Roar. They have made adjustments and 
picked up right where they left off under the name, Shards of Dalaya. All 
the players' characters are still even intact.

Do you think that SoE is either unaware of their continued existence or 
maybe doesn't have the financial resources to shut them down again if they 
had the law on their side? If there was anything "quasi-legal" about it, 
SoD would surely have been shut down again immediately upon restart.
