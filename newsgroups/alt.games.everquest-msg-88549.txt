Hmm I'm fairly sure the zone model file only has mobs that can actually
spawn in that zone, 'cos space is (or at least was) tight. With SoL they no
longer seem to care about memory limitations, of course.

I think cyclopses can spawn in WC, near the Kith side. There is an orc camp
in WC. *Fire* goblins in BBM has me confused though, I'm presuming you can
spot the difference between fire and aqua goblins, which are native to BBM.
