I'm in this position with the job I quit in February - they've asked
me to do some work on behalf of one of their clients. Since they've
let well over half the staff go (and made them predictably bitter)
whereas I quit on my own, I'm the best choice to ask.

I've told them that once they get my final paycheck to me (hey, it's
only five months late) and it *clears*, that I'll be happy to discuss
the project.
