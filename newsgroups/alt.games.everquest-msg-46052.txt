Nope, only after VI hid the numbers from being accessible by the code
they released

Server counters were a good way to check whether is actually *was*
likely to be a local or user problem, rather than a general one. Look at
the number on the servers, hmmm... seems about normal, must be my
problem then, lets see what I can do my end. If there's 1000 people on
servers with a usual 2000 population at that time, it's probably out of
your hands.

Sometimes it is your ISP/computer/region that's the problem, agreed.
Sunday's events most definitely weren't though
