    CoD is a raid zone with good XP. I wish the raid elements were toned
down, as without them the zone would be a great XP area and one of the few
level 65 dungeons in the game. Here's what is down each of the passages from
the four-way intersection near zone, directions are with you facing away
from the zone:

LEFT: this is the way to the Paffa event. You go up a flight of stairs,
clear a small stone room of puslings, then there's a small "fleshy walls"
room of puslings. The one exit from there leads to a room with a big,
untargettable Paffa in the middle. If you pull mobs out of there, you start
the Paffa event and waves of 5 puslings start spawning. Very important to be
aware of that, as the event script will continue for quite some time and a
puller that isn't cautious will end up pulling 50-odd puslings by accident.
The named puslings (Greater X Pusling), which you will see far too often,
drop the Mace of the Fallen Crusader and the Circled Toe Bones and always
drop them.

STRAIGHT: after clearing a room of puslings, you move forward again and are
in a room with diseased water (it hurts like lava) and a walkway across the
water. This is the start of the undead area. The mobs are SK (Death
Knights), WAR (Corrupted Knights), CLR (Pestillence Priests), or WIZ
(Deathbone/Firebone Magus). You've likely pulled them to zone-in before, so
you know how hard they can hit. The casters have very minimal HPs for the
level, and the area is great XP. Assuming, that is, that Carprin isn't up.
If he is up, he'll be in the room just across the walkway and to the left.
He hits for 1200, and if he and his two guards are killed in the right order
he respawns as a very tough raid-level mob. Despawning him requires some
trickery, and only lasts for a day. He essentially ruins the undead wing for
XP (there's quite a large area past him, filled with spawns). Named stuff
here either has "elite" in front of the name or has a higher class title.
For example, the named Pestillence Priest is the Pestillence Archon. Named
undead frequently do not drop anything, but stuff that can come from here
includes Corpse Shroud Shawl, Bile Soaked Shoes, Belt of Dripping Bile,
Wicked Bone Atatl, and Decayed Chain Links.

RIGHT: after passing through some cobweb-filled passages filled with
puslings, you come to a room with Bubonians (giant ratmen) in it and an
opening on the far wall leading into some "fleshy wall" tunnels. This is the
entry to the Bubonian area. The bulk of them will be SHM mobs and WAR mobs.
There are traps that spawn a multitude of hard hitting, small (think barely
up to a gnome's waist) flies. Triggering such a trap at the wrong time will
usually kill a party, although if pulled and controlled the flies make good
XP (extremely low HPs for the level/damage output). There are supposedly
many big nameds, but I have never seen them. They drop stuff like the Ring
of Bone and Worm Eaten Skull Charm. What I have seen are the mini-nameds,
which can spawn in any Bubonian spawn point. They always drop their loot
item, and the loot from there includes Bubonian Bandage Turban, Skull Charm,
Putrid Belt of Rotten Hide, and the Bile-Drenched Main Gauche. You will see
these mini-nameds as often as you saw the mini-named Puslings, so you will
get a ton of loot (of high quality) here.

    Now, this is how I would have made the zone a bit better. Extend the
left-hand area, putting Paffa at the end of the extended area. Have a
different type of pusling down deep, with mini-nameds that can spawn from
them. The goal would be to provide as much space to explore as there is in
the undead and bubonian wings. Have Carprin be turned into a triggerable
spawn, a la Halls of Honour, where speaking a phrase to a quest NPC in his
room starts the event. That way, the undead wing is always open to
exploration. There is an NPC at the end of the Carprin event that would be
the perfect choice for the quest NPC. Change the drop table on the named
undead so if an item doesn't drop, a spectral parchment does. This would
reward people for taking on the tougher named mobs from deeper in. In the
bubonian area, try and make reasonable the maximum number of flies that can
spawn from a trap so groups aren't slaughtered for trying to explore. Move
the mini-nameds there over to the spectral/item loot table. Up the respawn
rate on the mobs a little, so each wing can comfortably support two solid
groups. Finally, the lower part of CoD is devoid of mobs when the trigger
for the Bertox event isn't up. Fill that area with mobs like the ones that
spawn during the Bertox event, with the same loot table (things like the Two
Tined Pitchfork and the Sinew Somethingorother Bow drop during the event).
Now we have a zone that is challenging for a group, drops great loot that is
appropriate to the level range, has raid elements, encourages people to move
away from the zone-in, has plenty of room to handle many people, and even
has a more "private" area for people that have their raid flags. I envision
being able to support 10 groups of players at once - two at zone-in, two
each in extended pusling, bubonian, and undead areas, and two in the lower
part. Now that would have helped with crowding in other zones (PoV/PoS/BoT)
while giving a good dungeon experience, wouldn't it have?
