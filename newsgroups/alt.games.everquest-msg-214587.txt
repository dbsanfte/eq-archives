Well having done 6 of these now I can say that I kind of like
some aspects of them and really hate other aspects.

I succeeded once, failed 4 times and got one partial success (
did not complete the objective in the 90 minute time limit but
did before the dungeon expired)

1. Time limit. While I think a time limit is good these dungeons
are way too hard to complete in the time given.

On the time we succeeded we had high dps group and killed like mad,
had no deaths and no wipes and it was the easiest type of quest, the
collection quest, where you have to gather a certain number of items
dropped from mobs. our group had 2 mages, a beastlord, a monk(me)
a shaman, and a chanter.

If you have a group with poor DPS you are screwed.

If you have even one wipe, you are screwed.

If you get the rescue or assinate quests and you make too many
wrong turns into dead ends, you are screwed. Everyone should go
get the maps from maps.eq-toolbox.com they helped me to complete
the second rescue quest I tried, saved me from going down they wrong
paths. Only got a partial success due to a wipe but without the map
it would have been impossible to complete at all, had we mad a wrong turn.
Sucks that you need maps but oh well.

2. Interactive objects seem to be a waste of time. They are either traps
or have had shit loot so far. They are just there to make you waste time
fucking with them. In the adventure that I succeeded in we ignored them
and we barely won with 5 min to spare. Save them to the end, you can always
go back to them.

3. The Traps suck. Bring a rogue or someone to disarm traps, get the spells
asap.
These put on HUGE dots and cause lots of damage.

4. You MUST have KEI/clarity for all casters, make sure it is fresh when
you enter or bring a chanter.

5. You must take on multiple mobs and/or have good Crowd Control. You need
to kill fast and furious. Lull/Pacify is da bomb! Don't do the FD split
thing with
a monk, sk or necro it takes way too long.  Mobs seem to all go back to
their spawns
together pretty fast after they lose agro. FD pull to grab a group to mez
works ok.

6. Bring a paladin or Cleric to rez people back when they die.
Cleric's with a click-stick are awesome for these.

7. Don't die. If you get into trouble FD, ZONE, or EVAC!!
You don't have to have to worry about training anyone hehe. Running back to
the zone
and rezoning back in is faster than doing a CR and having to rebuff and med
up.
Mobs go back to their spawns pretty quickly.

8. Get the adventure and go to the dungeon entrance. THEN buff and med up.
once you enter the dungeon timer starts. You have 30 min to enter, it only
takes
5 min to get to the dungeon from the camp. You have 25 min, use it.
Put on every buff you can think of including resists at the beginning. You
want
fresh long lasting buffs. Refresh only essential buffs as you go, as mana
will be tight.
Sow before you enter.

9. The mobs get tougher the deeper you go. They also drop better stuff.

10. If you reach the 90 min time limit keep going. You still have another
30 min to complete and get some points. Also you can get more items
and Augmentations.

11. Be ready to cure poison and disease from the traps.

12. The loot has been pretty decent. At level 60+ group we Usually get
300-400pp
per group member from cash loot, research/tradeskill components,
3-4 augmentations, 1-3 items. This is without any loot from
chests/barrels/etc.

13. Bind as close to the dungeon as possible. MAKE everyone in the
group do this. If you wipe you can still complete the quest and still get
partial points even if you miss the 90 min timer.


An AE group might do well, I have not tried that yet.

Any one have any other good tips?

I must say though that I have been having fun, they are just damn hard.
