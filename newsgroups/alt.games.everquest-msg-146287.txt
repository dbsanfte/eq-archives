Various mobs in Maidens Eye and Umbral Plains most recently.  Akheva Ruins,
various mobs.  I can't say that I was impressed with the xp in ME, seemed
kind of slow really.  Umbral Plains was not bad, Akheva was better.  Also
spent time in Acrylia Caverns, which was not bad, most of the mobs were
blue, but high blue I believe.  Kael, various giants, ranging from low blues
to high blues mostly (some greens too, but you get past them pretty
quickly).  The Grey, mostly blues, a few even cons near the temple.  Fungus
Grove, most, if not all blues, but, we did have a 60 ranger to do the
pulling to get singles.

I guess that part of the problem here is that I have fun, even if the xp is
not all that great.  I play the game to have fun, and chat with friends.
Sure, I like getting decent xp and levelling too, but that's not the primary
purpose.
