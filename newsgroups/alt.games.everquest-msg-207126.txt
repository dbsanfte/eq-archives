Attempted the run at 7th level, Nektulos to Qeynos....Had been given my
first SoW and after enjoying it a while decided to go for it and make the
run.
Got thru Kithicor at night, somehow (knowing nothing of what was lurking in
the darkness or about sticking to the north wall) made it thru HH, got some
pally buffs to help, sow had now gone...made it down the ramp, the whole
time expecting to be pounded by a hill giant that I'd been told lurked in
EK. Then I met Broon who had just spawned...That was the end of that
trip...A friend looted my corpse and returned my stuff.

Second time, another sow, no time wasted, I'll outrun that Cyclops this
time...Hit Kithicor at night, again, found out last time was a fluke and
what actually lurked in the lurked in the darkness...Friend looted my corpse
and returned my stuff.

Third time, banked all my gear (starting to learn now) and bought a port to
NK...Luckily from a Wizard, not sure what the druids would have done to me
as a Dark Elf, the next time I would go to NK I had killed so many Gnolls
and Bandits they were my "friends."
I ran, without SoW to Qeynos...how I got thru NK I don't know...WK wasn't so
bad, I knew the way pretty well from there.

The other day (on FV) a 10th level Cleric was asking for a port to FP in
Qeynos Hills. Doing a / All in the zone, the only 2 characters that *may*
have been port classes (ie in RP mode) were both mine so I knew he was out
of luck there. I offered him a SoW from my Shaman.  He mentioned he had died
once before but would try again, at that point I realised there was no safe
way thru High Pass now, FV is a quiet server, this was Saturday morning UK
time and there would be no one keeping Gnolls or Orcs in check, so I did the
good guy thing (for once) and, with my Ranger and Shaman, escorted as far as
EC...Keeping him camo'd the whole time, for safety. We made it with out any
problems..There were a couple of gnolls at the entrance but absolutely no
Orcs at the other side, I suppose they had done a charge to the guards as
they do and hadn't respawned, we were lucky.

You know what the scariest part of my first run was? Not Broon pounding into
the Karana dirt, or the fear of Hill Giants on EK's ramp and certainly not
Kithicor, I had no idea about the place. It was having a Giant Spider walk
over me in EC, while wearing headphones...I'll never forget that moment, I
physically jumped at the noise and the sight of this thing.
