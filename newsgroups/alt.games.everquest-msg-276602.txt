Yep, I'd rather have a warrior tank for me (well, a warrior I know 
anyway) anytime.  They now hold agro great, unless their equipment is 
very bad, and they take damage noticably better than knights.  Generally 
they also have more HP than knights, which is quite handy for spikes in 
damage output.  Now, if I had to pick between an unknown warrior, and a 
known knight, I'd go with the knight likely.
