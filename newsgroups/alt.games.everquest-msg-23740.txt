American English is a bastardisation of a much older language anyway. Most
of the people I see using the language have a pitiful grasp of gramma and
spelling. But since this is a news group, rather than an English language
class, I really don't think that it matters.

I suspect that many of the people who are critisising other people's
English, are missing the fact that English may not be their first language.
If you are going to flame someone about their language skills, I suggest you
do it in their language.
