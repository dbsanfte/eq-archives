Yes.  I have never had this trouble before and could not find it in
options any where (looked again tonight).  Like I said my Erud Necro
is in the 50's and I have used the elevator hundreds of times with
no trouble.  First time I noticed it was a couple weeks ago or so.
Tried camping and even destroyed my key to get another one just to
be sure.  Nothing has worked at all.
Odd thing is if I do not have key on my pointer and ht "U" I get a
you must have key type of message.
