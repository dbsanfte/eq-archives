I am a necromancer and quite capable of pet pulling.  Necromancers have a
one up on shadow knights in that we get Calliav, which blocks 3 incoming
hits magical or melee.  Situations in which pet pulling is not superior is
with mobs that hit fast and hard.  To pet pull, I am using the level 49 pet,
which is the 64 SK pet.  Any of the spectre pets will not pull singles.  If
a mob can kill the pet before it is out of aggro range of other mobs, then
pet pulling is not going to work.  There are a few ways to increase the pets
survival rate: Calliav, SoW/Shrew, hp buffs, runes -- group make up dictates
which of these options will be avilable.  Many GoD mobs run at or faster
than SoW, which makes pet pulling unreliable there.  PoP and LDoN hard mobs
are capable of 1 rounding an unbuffed pet, so the trick is to get the pet
back to you as fast as possible, making SoW/Shrew a near necessity.  Pathing
and doors can also be tricky, particularly in Tak advs.  The pet will run in
place at the door or spot of bad pathing and then warp back onto its owner,
all the time it is getting beat on while running in place.

Pet pulling is an awesome, and many say over powered, tool, but it has its
limitations.  Monks make better pullers in places where lots of mobs need to
be split away from where a single spawn is going to be engaged or in places
where mobs hit too fast and hard for the pet to survive the pull.
