No, /report *and* /petition.

A /petition alone may do little if the jerk has shut up
by the time the GM arrives on the scene.

A /report alone will do nothing, since /reports only
get attention if a /petition calls attention to it.

However, with both a /report and /petition, the
GM gets alerted to the problem, *and* already has
proof of what the idiot was doing -- he doesn't
have to hope the moron repeats himself (GMs can't
rely on someone's accusation, they have to either
personally witness the behavior, or have it
recorded for them verbatim via a /report).
