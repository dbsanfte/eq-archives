Just to set the record straight....

Verant was a completely seperate company that consisted of the core
dev/art team that worked on EQ while at 989 Studios.  The team broke
away and formed Verant but the game was still owned by Sony (989) so
Verant was doing the same work, for the same people, but with the
possibility of the next game being all theirs.  Well, money being what
it is....

Now this is where my knowledge gets a bit fuzzy.  Somehow SOE took
over 989 or just took the MMORPG aspect, not sure which or how.  The
result was that SOE offered to buy Verant and all it's talent, so that
it was once again completely controlled by Sony.  Such was the extent
of Verant's involvement; essentially a gambit for a bigger slice of
the pie.

One may argue that it failed, or that it was successfull.  Both have
supporting cases.  But here's one simple fact; Sigil owns (or will own
once the papers are signed with Microsoft) Vanguard.  Something that
was not the case when they formed Verant.
