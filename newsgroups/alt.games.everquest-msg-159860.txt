When I started playing EQ a year ago with a barb war the noob area was
always crowded and Black Barrow teaming with players and out of control
trains. Most recently, (about a month or so) when ever I passed thru, either
to Halas or Jagged Pine, both zones are near empty, even at 12 midnight GMT
which is around US peak time. However I went to Kelethin at 51 for some
spells and popped into my old haunt Crushbone and it was still quite well
occupied.

Could be less newbies and alts, could be a migration of hunting preference.
Many, many zones are simply wasted tho; how many people fight beyond the
bridge in Split Paw, or go to the Gorge of King Xxorbb? Many zones seem to
be solo only too, I rarely got a response to LFG in EW or JP.
