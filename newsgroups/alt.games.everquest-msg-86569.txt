It's not a simple fix..and it does not involve you...Well mostly... Ever
since the release of SoL....Verant has some graphics bugs to work out...
Some zones you can't see the mob you are killing, AKA Velektor Lab....can't
see mobs or use male human models or your game will crash..

Will verant fix it...Yes but it will be a long time for it to happen since
they have been trying to solve these issues since DEC 2001...
