Everfrost.  Watch out for the guards.  Being a dark elf you are probably KOS
to them.  I have heard tell of a spawn at Freeport's dock that can raise
your faction with the Halas guards but I have never confirmed that.  Might
be something to check out if you need faction in Halas.

Everfrost for a 18th mage wanting HQ pelts for tailoring would be a cash
cow.  Your pet can do all of the work and you just sit back and collect the
loot.  Guards in the stay at their posts.  Only ones that travel are out in
the area near the river where Tundra Jack and Iceberg his pet roam.
