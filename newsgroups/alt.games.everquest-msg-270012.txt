FWIW, something like this was SUPPOSED to be in SWG, but it was
dropped. A random camp would spawn a godo ways from a city. Thel onger
it remained, the bigger it became, and the more powerful the mobs it
spawned would be. So the environment around a city would change,
becoming filled with bandits or spiders or whatever. For some reason,
though, they couldn't get it to work, so it was pulled just prior to
release. A pity.
