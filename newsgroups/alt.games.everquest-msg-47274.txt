well, first off, if u didnt order it, tell the credit card company that, and
theyll take it off.

i had problems with my credit card company chargin me for somethin for like 20
dollars. somethin i didnt order. i forget what it was since it was so long ago.
i mailed them like 6 times and they said theyd fix it, but they never did, and
now they charge a late fee every month, and it keeps goin up and up (i think
its like 280 right now) and i get letters sayin pay or we will make this credit
worse or whatever, but they cant do that cuz its illegal so im gonna put up
with the annoying bill that i dont owe every month for like a year, if it
doesnt stop then ill just sue them for harassin me or whatever. anywayz my
advice is call the company and tell them u didnt order whatever it was, then
cancel your account and get a new one (the credit card, not everquest) my
advice to u
