  I would say forget mammoths in Everfrost.  I tried hunting them with
my druid and they are just too hard to find.  Sometimes there's a glut
of them, sometimes there's none.  Druid tracking isn't as good as
ranger tracking (and this was before the scrollbar was added) but my
searches came up utterly fruitless.  15 minutes+ searching with no
mammoths in sight.  Try to find another animal.
