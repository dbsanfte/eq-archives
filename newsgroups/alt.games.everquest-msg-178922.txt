Back in the days that I depended on HGs for funds I quickly learned
to log and play an alt when I saw a Bard on HG hill.  The Bards I
saw there were the greediest SOBs I've seen in the game, doing their
damndest to add every HG that popped to their kite string regardless
of whether they had to steamroller other folks or not.  I never saw
one of them kill a single PH.  Most of the Druids would at least kill
the lizards, since even a Druid can melee a mob that's 40 levels
green.  And the Paladins, SKs, and Warriors were mostly enthusiastic
about slaughtering all the PHs.  Necros and Mages were usually good
about it too, since they could have Jabober kill PHs while they
recovered mana.  Doesn't matter much to me anymore, like I said, if
I am killing HGs it's just a few to get some pocket change for a KEI.
