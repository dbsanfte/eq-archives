Monks do have less hitpoints (obviously) than all of those, but I 
wouldn't say they have less AC. Stupid monks have less AC than paladins. 
Warriors get tough to beat once they get into high end kunark armor, but 
not the others.

I'm yet to see a monk that regularly uses it in combat. For pulling, 
maybe, but not in combat. Monks really can tank without it

Not a warrior, but definitely higher than SK:
SK: has more hitpoints, taunt button, best taunter in the game
Monk: has higher AC, higher dodge, block, riposte...
Which one is better for taking damage? Or rather which one will take 
less damage per second?
