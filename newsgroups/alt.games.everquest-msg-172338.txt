You should do a report and then a petition.  What you do is get them to
admit or talk about what they are doing.  Scroll up so the text of them
admitting it is visible.  Type /report bozosname.  Then type /petition "bozo
is killing the banker.  I have filed a /report and have asked them to stop
but they wont.  Please stop them."  They probably wont be banned the first
time but if they keep it up they will.  Bozos will tell you GM's wont do
anything or theres no GM's on, but that report stays till someone handles
it.
