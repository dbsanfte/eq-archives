I had the same problem 6 months ago when I started playing, took me forever to
figure it out.  The game would hard freeze.  If you happen to have a ASUS  A7V
mother board and a sound/video card on slot 3 (I can't remember which, am
pretty sure it is the sound card) then you need to upgrade the bios on the
motherboard.  It will fix it.  There is a auto flash tool you can download off
of their webpage that updates it on the fly.

John
