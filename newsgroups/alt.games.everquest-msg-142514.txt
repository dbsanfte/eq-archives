At either level 16 or 20, it is not beneficial to give a pet a low level
weapon (however, a skelly with is scythe looks cool), except for a slight
bonus to the chance for a max hit.  At 29 (IIRC) you must give your pet 2
weapons to dual wield.  I believe at 39 it may be automatic for your pet to
dual wield (not there with necro yet).  You can get benefit with good
weapons that have max damage higher than the pets' natural damage and with
weapons that proc (I buy any Gnoll Hide Lariats I see for under 10pp).
