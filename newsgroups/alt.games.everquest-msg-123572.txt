I see what you are saying but malachite, food, water and bone chips
are all trivial to get. The necro or mage can just stomp any low level critter to
get loot and then they get their pets and is all downhill from there.

My point is that the mage at least gets 'some' armor and weapons
at will. Plus they can equip their pets which makes a big difference
in their survivability.
The armor doesn't make a whole lot of difference but they can make the
difference for those close calls.

When I started my mage I went to 12th level naked quite easily.
Also, with being able to summon food, water and bandages the
mage saves a lot of money at the lower levels.

I guess I read the original thread posters question as being which class
doesn't depend on gear and having to constantly upgrade it like warriors
do.
