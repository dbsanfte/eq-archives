Actually, Biz, it's more the other way around.  Employee wages are very nearly
first on the list of what gets paid out of the bankrupcy estate.

1) Administrative costs for the Bankruptcy estate. (Legal and accounting
fees).

2) Debts received after filing in Bankrupcy, and before the order of relief.

3) Wage Priority, limit of  $4,000 per employee, if earned within 90 days of
filing the petition.  ($4000 combined between wages and benefits).
