i have a related question:  if you cast 2 poison dots that are each
different level spells, will they still stack.  for example, will venom of
the snake (level 34 necro poison dot) stack with envenomed bolt (level 51
necro poison dot, basically the "upgrade" to venom of the snake) or will
envenomed bolt override venom of the snake?
