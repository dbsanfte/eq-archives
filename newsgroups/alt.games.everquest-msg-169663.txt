hmm i am a 65 cleric and i frequently have to heal monk hides on raids and
in groups......i hear monks of lvl50 to 65 whinin bout that supposedly
nerf.......but from the cleric view i just can say: they dont loose more HP
on mobs then before that "nerf", they tank the same mobs they did
before....shrug dunno but i just cant see a real difference there.
