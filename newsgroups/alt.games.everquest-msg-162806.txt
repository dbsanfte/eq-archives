    Didn't say it was. But you implied that, in general, people always have
enchanters with them so single-pulling doesn't matter. Most of the groups
I've been in since PoP was released haven't had enchanters.

> Shaman haste is pathetic

    Shaman has 60% haste. Or he does if he bothered to level to 63 and buy
his store-bought copy of Swift Like The Wind. Best ENC haste I saw was 70%
(Wonderous Rapidity), and most people ask for the 58% haste VoG because of
the nifty stats.

    Assuming your BST bothered to level up to 63, they'd have a 50% slowdown
(vs. 75% SHM, 70% ENC) and a 50% store-bought haste spell. 50% slowdown is
enough for me to keep up as a cleric, especially when the same person bring
mana regen with them. And 50% vs. 60% haste is "a pale imitation"?

    SP = Clarity-level mana regen. Ask casters if they can tell the
difference between having Clarity and not having it, even at level 65. And
we haven't even added in things like the Spiritual Strength line of spells
(HPs/ATK), Regrowth, Kragg, and the mana regen AA they get. We love our BSTs
in our guild because they bring so damn much to a group in the way of basic
utility and damage output.

> Whats left, ranger using earthcaller?  heh.

    That was what we had to use when I was finishing off level 65 in PoV -
no slowers available whatsoever, so we had the two rangers equip Earthcaller
and started hoping! It actually ended up working rather well, because the
warrior was so scared of being pounded into paste before slow landed that he
used Defensive/Evasive. Which I wish more warriors would do in XP situations
to increase efficiency.
