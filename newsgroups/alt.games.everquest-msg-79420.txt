Uh, no.  I can conduct experiments -- called "powerleveling" -- with
people by keeping them on their feet against yellows and reds w/o
doing *any* damage to the mob, directly or indirectly through damage
shields or the like.   The person doing the damage always gets the
XP, regardless of how many times I've had to heal him.

If your idea was true, it would be impossible for clerics to powerlevel
people without doing damage and then casting Atone on the mob (or
zoning.)  It's not.   I've ran into newbies in West Commonlands where
I've treated Remedy as a Complete Heal and could tell I healed for
far more HPs than the kodiak bear they were fighting has to begin
with.

Healing is treated as damage for purposes of aggro, but not for XP.
Ask someone who's been in a cleric groups chain-casting Complete
Heal on the main tank against tough mobs...
