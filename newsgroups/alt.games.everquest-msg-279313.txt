Agreed.

Of course there's a point.  You don't stop earning XP just because
you're out of 'blue exp", right?

And I'm still looking for just how that *eliminates* either of those.
If you're 1% from leveling, does it make sense to quit "early" and
level tomorrow night just because you're out of 'blue exp' or
play as long as you normally do and level?

As I tried to say, it's a way of keeping casual players leveling
so they don't feel so far "behind the curve."  That's not a 'bad
thing' IMO but it doesn't eliminate the need to grind *IF* you
had that need in the first place.
