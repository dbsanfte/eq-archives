Spending XP on Alt Advance while in the lower levels is a little easier
than spending XP at higher levels while in raids for instance.  While it
may seem that the AA XP bar is static in its means of raising, not all mobs
are easily soloable for most classes, even at higher levels with larger
mana pools and better resists.  Plane Raids or Raids, where high level
characters in the 60s tend to be large groups so they can get the more
interesting gear and loot, but the XP roll out does not involve large
groups, it singles out one group that did the most damage and allows them
the bounty of it.  What more, in most cases, raids fund the guild hosting
the raid, so the only real return is any lucky chance you get at a gear
item is if they let you.

The point of it all, is that doing AA sooner, than later, is no less valid
than the opposite.  For some, like me... Yeah, I am going to spend a hell
of a lot longer time Leveling now with the 50/50...  But to get more Wis as
I have to start sacrificing some gear for others to boost me in areas, like
protection, or better resists when it comes down to being in a decent raid
just to avoid dying...  Having maybe 2 more Wis without an item boost might
help out versus having none without an item boost.  For melee, having a
chance to bandage up to 80% of someone's health instead of 50% might be a
god send, especially for Tanks where their HP is could leech a healer dry,
leaving the rest of the group shafted for longer down time.  Yes, they use
a lot of bandages versus the big pump of a good Complete Heal or some such,
but then, it allows the Mage to be useful during the down time and others
who are waiting to dress their wounds to while one person is getting the
big heals.

Some of it could even stack, like Mental Clarity, the ability to have both
PotG and it going, or C2/C3 with it.  It will mean less time down getting
mana up, especially in heavy agro areas where you spend a good deal of the
time standing up to keep agro off.  Every small thing helps out, even if
you don't have the ga-ga levels of the higher ones.
