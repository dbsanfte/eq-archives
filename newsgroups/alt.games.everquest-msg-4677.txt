You have my sympathy. My alts are swimming in sabertooth and HQ cat
pelts, I've finally gotten to 56 in tailoring (must farm silk) and now
all the sabretooths are dropping MQ pelts. I figure I'll make a
skinning knife and downgrade them...
Metal *bits* were a nightmare until I got smithing 31, then they went
from failing more than every other time to almost no fails at all.
Odd. 
And I discovered an alternative to toolboxes for getting to 41: Field
point arrowheads. Metal bit, water, file, get a stack of 20 which
sells to vendor for 1 gp total and doesn't hog a main inventory slot.
