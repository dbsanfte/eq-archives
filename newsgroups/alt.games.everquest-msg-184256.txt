umm, technically, I'm a member of that group, gotta join it to read it 
sonny boy.  Got bored after about 10 mins but I never left the group, 
just in case I wanted to check them out at some other point.

don't count me in the 3550 please, I've never once posted to that group 
and only read the postings on the day I joined.  I don't get the emails, 
I have my settings so that they don't send me anything.
