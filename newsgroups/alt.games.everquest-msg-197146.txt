Two things wrong:

1) You are using a melee, which is going to get more from stamina, 
with a priest class.

2) they are level one.

This is the CORRECT way to perform your test:

www.magelo.com

Make a 65 wood elf warrior with ALL points into sta, giving him about
95 or 100 sta.

Make a 65 ogre warrior with ALL points into sta, giving him about 150
sta.

Notice how the ogre has nearly 300 more hit points.
