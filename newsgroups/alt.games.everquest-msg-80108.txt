Wus Armos is made by a tailor on prexus I would sell a complete set for
250p. With you being a young monk I suggest you make friends with a Shaman
or a Mage quick (esp if this is your first character). They can summon light
weight bags that have 100% weight reduction for looting. The AC hits are not
too bad at the lower levels but after 20 you will have to keep a close eye
on weight. You will need some cha items to get Charisma above 110 for buying
and selling Gems, carry gems instead of plat you will take a minor loss but
2k in Gems weights 0.1 veruses 50 stones in plat. All coins weigh approx 40
coins = 1 stone.
