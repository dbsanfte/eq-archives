Nope, not just hell levels. Right after the movelog to AB, I started
a char on my old server to stay in touch with friends and so on. When
I leveled from 1 to 2, the exp bar was a quarter of a blue away from
being completely filled.

Also, although 51 IS a hell level, when I dinged 51 off a cyan Spectre,
the exp bar showed a full blue into 51. When I zoned, it reverted to
the completely empty version, /cry

So it's happened on both hell and non-hell levels for me, at least...
