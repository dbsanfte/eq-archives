Though I'm nowhere near the level to be obtaining them, I might hazard a
guess. There is at least the *appearance* of consistency of certain
types of items in the game, and scalps, from my experience, tend to be
needed to give to various npc's for faction boosts. (Orcs and gnolls
come to mind.)  Are there any groups of NPCs that are terminally at war
with, or plagues by the Ry'Gorr in question?  Seems like there might be
an NPC hanging around someplace who would take them and give you a
faction boost.
Just a guess.
