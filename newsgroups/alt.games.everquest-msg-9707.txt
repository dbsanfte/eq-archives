Only if you steadfastly refuse to look at all the evidence.  The
bottom line is that Koresh et al. started the fire.  All the hemming
and hawing about two GS canisters, neither of which went where
the fires started, neither of which were fired when the fires started,
and one of which went into a pool of water, is simply BS.
