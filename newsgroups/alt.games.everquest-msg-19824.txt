Another possibility is that he may not realize that on some
newsreaders, once you read a post, you won't see it at all
again unless you flip some settings around.  It will appear
to have vanished, but what's really happening is that the
newsreader is assuming you don't want your message list
cluttered up with things you've already read, so it only
shows you the ones yet to be read.

Perhaps the posts of his that have "disappeared" are the ones
he read after he posted them, and the ones that are
"still there" are the ones that he did not retrieve and
read after he had sent them.
