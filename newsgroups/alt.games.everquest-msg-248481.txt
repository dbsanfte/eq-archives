Lose the stuns. If needbe, you can mem 2 or just Sound of Might. Since
you are the primary healer, assign stun duty on Paladins and another
cleric. Also, lose the Celestial stuff and stick with Supernal heh.
And keep Yaulp VI up at all times. Its mana regen while youre
standing. Personally I'd employ:

Complete Healing - obvious
Supernal Remedy - Fast Heal
Supernal Elixir - HoT
Divine Aura - Invuln is a must
Mark of Kings - override DS
Yaulp VI - a must have
Divine Intervention - should have UD3 or otherwise this is a waste
Divine Barrier/Supernal Light/Ethereal Elixir/Word of Replenishment

If you have lots of clerics, have someone on Mark duties (Kings,
Righteous) so you can free up a spell slot for group heals and such.
