There is an extremely...surprisingly low...incidence of cheating or hacks.
There are only a couple of programs that I'm aware of that give others an
advantage over you, and besides those programs I don't know of any cheats.

On the majority of the servers you can only be killed on purpose either with
your consent (dueling or wandering into posted PvP areas), or by people
breaking the rules and purposely bringing monsters to you (extremely
extremely rare and you have to piss them off first), or by being in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

There is a saying in EQ, "if you don't want to get hit by a train, stay off
the tracks."  A train is lead by a player desperate to get to the Zone line
(you enter a different part of the world and the monsters don't follow), and
the rest of the train is made up of monsters.  If you Zone into that zone as
that person is zoning out then you'll see a bunch of monsters looking around
for something to do...and you are handy. :)  If you are zoning into a
dungeon it is best if you stay by the computer until your character is "off
the train tracks."  A dungeon zone line is a VERY STUPID place to go away
from your computer.
