}I think the legal system is based heavily on precedents isn't it? Hmmn - I

}themselves for gross negligence and stupidity and win. I think that one
}single precedent would improve the legal system dramatically.

You know, and the beautiful thing about that is you could even cite the 
very calling of the case as evidence. :)

}I would volunteer myself for the task as I am sure I qualify on a number of
}counts, but the Crown* would surely use the insanity loophole in my case.
}Any relatively sane person want to take one for team?
}The Crown* - I am in Australia for those that wonder what the heck that
}means - I think you guys in the US would say "The State" or the "The People"
}or something.

But surely this would be Rastus v. Rastus, and not The Crown v. Rastus? 
Just instruct your other lawyer not to use that defense.
