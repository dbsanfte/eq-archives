After I posted that, (and Davian did get the gist of what I was 
sarcastically trying to imply :) ) I went over to EQTraders, and checked 
the fishing forum.  Apparently, with at least one of the macro things you 
can do just that... I hadn't considered that possibility honestly, since 
summoning a new pole each time would probably make you fish slower.  But I 
suppose you could summon/reequip in the time it takes the button to 
refresh.
