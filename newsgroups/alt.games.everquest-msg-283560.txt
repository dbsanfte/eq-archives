I thought EQ only ran on 80x86 and some PowerPC processors?
Still, the introduction of hardware abstraction layers and global
networks is wonderous. Even the much diminished usenet here remains
quite amazing in the technical acheivments required to make it work.
EQ itself, however, is not amazing for using these existing technology
and techniques :) All EQ has to know is TCP and UDP, let the OS and
network systems handle routing of traffic. All EQ has to know is
DirectX, let the OS figure out which drivers to use*. What was amazing
about EQ, as I see it, was setting up a system that could
simultaneously handle tens or even hundreds of thousands of connections
at once and not bog down the software as to be unusable. Even
text-based MUDs (at least the ones I frequented) often suffered
slowdowns after a few thousand simultaneous connections. The solution
they came up with - independantly hosted zones - was a decent enough
solution for the time when other solutions were less well understood.
Since, other software vendors have come up with improvements and even
better solutions, but for its time it wasn't too bad. As annoying as
zones are, it's still a viable solution. Still want to see overlapping
discrete zones implemented, but I know that remains my own pipe-dream
:)

The global network is an amazing thing. Let's not start attributing it
to Sony, though :)

* - notably muddled when someone wrote some bit of code optimized for
one vendor or another to try and improve performance by bypassing the
HAL, neglect to document this, lose the guy who wrote the code
initially, the new guy(s) come in with no clue as to why video starts
blanking when they call what should be a standard DirectX call. This is
why vendor preferencing and deviating outside established frameworks is
bad.
