I'm using a Linksys (one of the BEFSR41/BEFSR11/BEFSRU31 models, I
forget). The only problems I've run into with it (and DLink) are that
it doesn't do so well once you start getting a good amount of
concurrent connections. For example, if playing EQ on computer A, and
refreshing Half-Life server list on computer B, computer A's EQ
session goes linkdead. If I remember correctly, the max concurrent
sessions is 255.

I wouldn't expect any problems if you're only using a couple computers
to play EQ. I may have 3 EQ sessions going at once, plus some web
browsing, with no problems.
