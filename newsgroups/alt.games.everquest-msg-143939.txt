Hi all!

I have a question about hotkeys:
many websites dealing about hotkeys show examples with two-commands 
lines, as this:
    /sit off, /doability #

But I think it does not work anymore.
Do u confirm this fact or do I write some buggy hotkeys?

Thanks for answering this newbie question :P
Explanation: I do not play often and I think I still have lots of 
basics tricks to learn yet...
