My grandfather had one of those Radio Shack computers.  He thought he was so
modern when he got that.  Too bad it was obsolete so fast after he bought
it.  Thought it was so cool that it used a real cassette tape to actually
save things that he typed up on the computer.  Took forever for it to find
the stuff that are saved but that's beside the point.  Fond memories of
rewinding the tape because somebody else forgot to rewind the last time they
used it and it never found what I was trying to load up.
