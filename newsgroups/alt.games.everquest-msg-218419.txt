The problem in this case was that Sadaam had all the time in the world
to move the stuff.  We sat on our hands for months trying to get the
UN to go along, all the while giving Sadaam plenty of time to move
evidence.  My guess is he knew we were coming but were waiting for
world consensus.  I have no idea how you feel about Henry Kissinger
but he said the question is not "Does he have them, it's where did
they go."

They hate us because we are wealthy by just about anyone's standards.
They hate us because we are more powerful and more prosperous than
anyone else.  And they hate us because their dictatorial governments
blame us for all the suffering of their countrymen.  And which part is
naive?  Have you ever seen the balance sheet for the UN?  Ever seen
how much money they have to work with and how much the US pours into
the UN every year?  Ever looked at the troop ratios for *any* UN
peackeeping mission?

I for one am not prepared to wait to see if he has or will use WMD's.
He has a record that speaks for itself.  Once he has them he'll use
them, or threaten to use them.  Then what?  It's too late for military
action at that point, or at least action with minimal casualties.

Which lie are you referring to?  And yes I am aware of the irony..

I think there is a difference between press leaks and national secrets
leaks.
