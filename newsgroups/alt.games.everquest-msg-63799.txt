Monk epic is HUGE. Let's see:
1) Instant click buff that works indoors...incredibly useful when fighting
dispellers
2) When you get to the very high end game, your epic does not rot in the
bank because you got a better weapon.
3) Soloing deliciousness....a haste buff. Combine with a beefy haste item
like a rakusha cloak, dragon haste item, or SBC, and you can haste cap
yourself without bothering the shaman/enchanter in your group.
4) Easy quest, except for the raster camp, which is just patience, and not
a huge battle...plus the intermediate rewards are quite nice.
5) AC15, Str+20, Dex +10, Sta+10, Agi +10, HP +100, All resists +10..ON
YOUR HANDS. As a side benefit of having all that niceness out of your
weapon slot, when (well, if) you get better later on, you aren't giving up
a prodigious amount of resists or stat bennies to increase your damage per
minute by 2%. High AC in any slot is really difficult for a monk...the 15
that the fists give is surpassed by only a tiny handful of other items,
which are either really hard to get (gauntlets of dragon slaying), or
immensely heavy (slime blood of cazic-thule).

Actually, it has pretty crappy stats too. The right click is especially
poor. Insulting, even. Least the cloak of shadows in PoA drops with
reasonable frequency now, not like the one-every-3-months that it was
before.
