Nobody here has argued that VI's position is unassailable, or that EQ is
perfect and could not be improved, but that's a far cry from Sang's
assertion that EQ's designers are stupid. I think that that is
self-evidently not true, as demonstrated by the fact that making a
successful MMORPG is far from trivial, as the AC and AO debacles have
shown.

My opinion, and feel free to flame me, is that those games tried to give
the players too much of what they wanted, rather than what they need.
They listened to what players bitched about the most in EQ (slowness of
progress, downtime, camping) and made changes to address those issues.
In the process, they wrecked their games. I know this view is not
popular, but I think that it's VI's intransigent loyalty to their
derided "vision" what keeps EQ successful.
