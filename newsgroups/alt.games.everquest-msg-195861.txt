empirical evidence contradicts this.  From the time 
when I wanted to get a 'bot enchanter to grouping level
with our regular group - 58 mage (me), 59 ranger, 60 druid.

for the levels of 38, 39 and 40 your formula says -
38 -> 38 divided by 2 is 19, whole number so don't round, 
add 38 and 19 and get 57.

39 -> 39 divided by 2 is 19.5 - rounded up is 20, level
is 59.

40 -> 40 divided by 2 is 20 - level is 60.

I was VERY interested in when my 'chanter would be able
to group with me, as it is much more fun to simply hunt
for xp or cash with the mage than it is to PL.

I was expecting him to need to get to 39 - being a believer
in the Level * 1.5 rule (although I always doubted the
rounding up - as all other formulas in EQ round down).

However, at level 38 he conned cyan to my mage.  I grouped
him and he got xp.

So, a level 38 gets xp with a 58 - this is an observed fact.
Since it disagrees with your hypothesis, we must discard
the hypothesis - basic scientific method.

However - 2/3 * Higher level rounded down (more in keeping
with other formulas) results in ->

58 * 2/3 = 38.66 -> 38   Fits observed evidence
59 * 2/3 = 39.33 -> 39   Fits the observed evidence (was
able to group him with me and the ranger at 39)
60 * 2/3 = 40 also fits observed evidence (grouped him
from then on out with our regular group.  Just haste
and clarity, later Boon, but it was a boost)
