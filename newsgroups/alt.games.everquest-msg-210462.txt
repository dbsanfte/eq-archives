At level 55 I can easilly tank level 63 mobs with my Warrior.  I just bought
him a Greatstaff of Thurnder. a 31/30 Two-hander that procs a Planar Stun.
Once I get good agro with it I can keep agro even from a 57 epiced monk and
55 Paladin.  The stunn proc really pisses the mobs off.  So, put a 55 shadow
knight against a 63 melee type mob or paladin and you will see your healers
crying OOM all the time.

Until  sony gives warriors one-handers that are on par with the Shadow
Knighr and Paladin one-handers, two-handers should be used when they hit
their 50s.
