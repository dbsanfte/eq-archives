You're quite right. It's not. Only noobs still do hill giants.

If your pet can handle the heat (dunno the strength of your pet at 64)
go to droga and mow down those mobs. They don't have much in the way
of hp so you should go through them like crazy. Even my ranger melees
them for almost no damage. They drop significant pp each. Or you could
go to Sebilis, even with the gem nerf you can now destroy them so fast
you'll get a bunch of them and there's not likely to be too many
people there.
