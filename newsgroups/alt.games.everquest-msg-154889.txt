Where we ran into the issue was that you can only have one active guild that
you created.  If the guild is removed, you can create a new guild.  We had
to do that as the original creator of our guild had long since moved on, and
decided he wanted to make a new guild.  We had to have a GM rename our
guild, create a new guild with the old name, then be invited to the new
guild.
