One of the Mage lines of spells are the Bolts.  I recall from long ago 
that bolts were a problematic line, because they travelled in a line 
between caster and target, and if anything got in the way, they'd hit 
that instead.

This meant a lot of misses, when fellow group mates got in the way, or 
when the mob was manuevered so that a tree or something got in the way.

Luckily, on the blue servers (where I am almost always found), you can't 
damage any other player... or even, it seems, your pet.

Worse, it also meant potential for hitting other mobs.  Aggro an 
indifferent mob, or pull the wrong mob, or waken mezed mobs or break 
root on rooted mobs or just anger an add and pull him off the MT... bad 
juju.

SO I rarely if ever used the bolt line unless under very controlled 
situations.

Well, fast forward past a 5 month absence.  Playing around with the new 
spells of my shiny new level 61, I tried the firebolt, just to see what 
it was like.  Raw shiny power in big batches is what its like, average 
over 2000 damage per cast.  I was wasting some time getting into 
position and making sure my pet wasn't in the way, that no other player 
was in the way and so forth, but I kept using it because it was working 
well.

Well, keep doing something like that over an extended period of time and 
you can get sloppy.  I had several close calls where I was sure I'd hit 
someone in the back, others where I was sure I was going to hit a tree...

Kept doing it, and gradually realized I was getting more and more close 
calls... and never one miss.  Not one, not in hundreds of casts.  I 
stopped paying any attention to positioning myself.  Then I stopped not 
casting when looking at everyone in my group but the MT, including 
several pets, all in between me and my target.

I paid attention, mind you, but now I was looking for the miss.

Haven't had one miss yet, not in three levels of using the spell in 
increasingly less careful ways.

Did they change something about bolts?  Do they no longer hit targets 
other than the one they are aimed at?  Is it perhaps something to do 
with the new collision worries I keep hearing mentioned, accidental and 
might get fixed later?

Or am I nuts and bolts have never had this problem?

I Know that I've had the problem with arrows on past character, times 
when I'd fire and not get a hit or miss message, presumably hitting 
someone in the back... and I clearly recall picking up an accidental 
elephant add while fear kiting an aviac in SK long ago.  Heck, I even 
recall a funny tactic which involved kiting a centaur and getting him to 
accidentally hit an aviak, which made the two of them fight; wait till 
the battle is nearly over, then kill both.
