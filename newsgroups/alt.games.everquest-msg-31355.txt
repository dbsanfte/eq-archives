There are many names that have obviously been done to be stupid, eg on
Torvonn..... thisgamesucks, inneedofmoney are just two examples I have 
seen....

As someone else said....I am quite happy to see them, means I WONT group
with them.

I do feel more than faintly aggrieved when somebody gets these through
name filters yet I have to spend weeks trying to get a surname passed, get
told its OK only for nothing to happen.....

Guide's seem fairly limited...they can do man y many  things that are
useful, but only that do not directly impactr on you..ie they can summon
your corpse, but cant take things off it to give to you, 

They certainyl cant do names.,..I had 4 guides tell me mypropsed surname
was OK but had to pass it onto a GM for confirmation....eventually I gave
up on that name and foud something else (which is much more cheesy but fit
that particular character).
