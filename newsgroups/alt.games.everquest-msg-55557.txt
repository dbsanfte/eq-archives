Actually, seafuries are kinda bugged, don't use them as an example.

There are NO level 42ish outdoor giant classed mobs that only doubles
for 70's other than seafuries.  Basically these are the biggest melee
wimps in the game, the only thing that even remotely makes them a
challenge is the fact that they have the hitpoints of an outdoor giant
classed mob.

Basically, seafuries should be the same difficulty as ice giants in
Everfrost right outside Perma.  A melee centric group of 3 would have
a much harder time with the ice giants (some of whom dual wield).

Sorta.
A lava drake and a Lava Defender both con red.  Lava drake can be done
with one group--trivially.  No way a Lava Defender is being killed
with one group unless it's one group of 3 clerics, 2 rogues and 1
warrior all at level 60 and armed to the teeth and VERY lucky.  Even
then, I'm putting my money on the Defender.
