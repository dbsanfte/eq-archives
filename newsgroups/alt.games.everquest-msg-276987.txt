Which will be the case with games where you use real world money to buy 
virtual stuff.  If not immediately, then soon.

Indeed, MtG did NOT really say this upfront.  Their rules contained an 
'ante' system where you could win cards.  A player might conclude that 
with sufficient skill, he could win enough cards not to have to buy any.

Of course, people PREFERRED to buy cards than gamble with what they had.

It seems to me that it is you who is trying to prevent market forces 
from operating normally.
