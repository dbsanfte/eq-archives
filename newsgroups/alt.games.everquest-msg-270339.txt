Even if it works, PLing can only be done within a fairly narrow window.
Found this out the good way with an exploit (well, I think it's an exploit):
I got mousetrapped by highway bandits (yellow ^^ group mobs).  I wound up
with 2 bands of them, one at each end of a ravine.  I was Level 15.  A
guildie (Level 24) zoned in and invited me to group (you can invite someone
from across the zone).  When I did, the bandits instantly turned grey and
ignored me.  I also got a message saying that I was grouped with someone too
far above me, that I would get no XP from any fights.

Come to that, everything in the area, bandits, kodiaks, wolves, gnolls,
undead, everything, was now grey to me and I could wander around safe as
houses.  Well, except for those giant bears over there, who I stayed a long
way away from.  I could have wandered the entire area for the rest of the
day, foraging my little heart out, and ignoring almost everything.  Well,
until my guildie disbanded or zoned.
