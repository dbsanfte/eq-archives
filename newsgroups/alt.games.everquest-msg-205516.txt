    Interesting - there were population numbers in the article. 80000 people
online, average, over 47 servers. That's less that 2000 per server, even if
you assume that 6 of those servers are pretty much empty (FV, VZ, TZ, SZ,
RZ, SH). That's LESS people per server than before the numbers were hidden
from view. Very interesting, indeed.
