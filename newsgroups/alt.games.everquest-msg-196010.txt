Hmmm, maybe %t vs. %T is what's wrong with a macro I made the other
day.  It reads approximately like this:

/g ASSISTING %t
/assist
/g ATTACKING %t
/pet attack

It would consistently say:

ASSISTING Bilbo
ATTACKING Bilbo

Even when an experienced friend made sure he had something valid
targeted, and I had him targeted before hitting the macro.
