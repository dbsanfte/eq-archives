Dreadlands, in the "Hidden Valley".

None, I believe.

Zap up to the Nexus, zone into Shadow Haven, and talk to the
nearby Soulbinder NPC to get yourself bound in Shadowhaven.

spires in the first place.  27 is low to be hiking through
the Dreadlands, so look sharp for wandering mobs and use
Invisibility if you can swing it.
