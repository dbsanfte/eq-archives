There seems to be some confusion with various iterations of UO, and UO2.
What was, and is, close to release is UO 3rd Dawn, which adds 3D models and
other graphics enhancements to the UO client.  UO2 was still quite a way
from release.

I think I might give it a try myself.  By reading this thread I learned some
interesting things about UO.  I didn't know they did that whole dove/hawk
server thing to help with the PK problem.  That is what has always kept me
away from UO was the incessent PK talk on their newsgroup.

The thing that appeals to me about UO is the trade skill system.  It seems
to have a good one.  Does anybody know how their player economy stands?  Can
anyone compare the economy of UO to the economy (or lack thereof) of EQ? Is
it fun and profitable to practice UO tradeskills?
