spdat.eff is wrong in this case; Only clerics get Celestial, and
clerics get a bonus to all healing spells. Superior, for instance,
heals more than 600 HP when a cleric casts it. I believe the bonus
we get is 5% or so? Not sure, really. I *think* Greater Healing is
a 315 heal for me, and it's listed as a 300 heal in spdat.eff.

If 5% is the right bonus, that puts Celestial at 756 hit points
over 24 seconds. This doesn't change your HP/Mana ratio appreciably,
however. Well, it changes the ratios, but not the comparison of
the different ratios, since you omitted the bonus from all the
calculations.

On top of that, sometimes you get a free Cel pulse, putting the
total healed near a thousand. Beat that for the mana and casting
cost!

>So:
>CelHeal --  720 HPs/225 mana = 3.2 HPs/mana

My numbers say 3.36

>SupHeal -- 583 HPs/250 mana = 2.33 HPs/mana

612 for SupHeal with a 5% bonus, make that 2.448

>Healing -- 100 HPs/60 mana = 1.67 HPs/mana

105, 1.75

ITYM Hit points? -----------------^^^^

Add in the fact that you can cast Celestial on a puller as he
pulls, and have him near full health for a while after he comes
back with the prey. Saves you some time on that Complete,
meaning he gets more time to gain agro on the mobs.

Well, I certainly still use it, however, sometimes you want that
caster to survive a really nasty mob, and then you gotta break
out Divine light, damn the expense. Or you might want to throw
it on a MT to keep him alive while the CH chain completes.

In grinding, however, Celestial is superior to most other heals
on all but the MT.
