For me, it's nothing to do with thinking the commercial means they
have rats in their restaurants (I don't). It's the fact that they're
running a commercial that turns my stomach with its imagery and makes
me want to shove a pen in my ears with the horrid singing. Yeah, I
change the channel. But a company that runs a commercial that bad is
going to drive away more people than it attracts. ><
