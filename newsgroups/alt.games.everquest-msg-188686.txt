I beleive XP is based off of the mob's level and it's relation to your
level. A mob 1 level below you will con the same as a mob 2 levels
below you, but you'll get more xp off the one 1 level below you. Also,
all mobs of the same level are worth the same xp in the same zone.

Don't have any specific sources to cite for the info and I can't
really confirm for sure, this is just the info I've been given from a
high level guildie.
