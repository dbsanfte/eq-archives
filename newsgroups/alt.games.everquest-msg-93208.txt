Any of the true GF4s (from that now-delayed 4200 on) would be at the top of 
the list.  It's just the MXs that are suckfully misnamed.

Also, most of the GF2 options aren't readily available anymore.  They all 
got discontinued in favor of the GeForce 2 Ti (which is basically a renamed 
Ultra).  I think that may even be discontinued at this point, in favor of 
the GeForce 3 Ti200, given that the Ti200 is selling mail order for 
~US$120.
