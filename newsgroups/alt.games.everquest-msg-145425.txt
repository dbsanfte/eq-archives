    You just have to explain yourself so clearly that even a moron can
understand. For example, say I get a "can u res in dawnshroud plz" message.
The response will usually be something like "I'm sorry, but I'm very busy
trying to complete some transfers before going to bed. I'll be unable to res
you tonight." Or perhaps "I'm sorry, but I'm running to res a guildmate
before heading out to a raid. I'm afraid your zone isn't along my way - I
won't be able to help you."

    Seems like a fair amount of typing, but I've found that as soon as you
explain how busy you are (and I am, this isn't faked) that people shoot back
a "NP" or "thank u 4 ur time" and leave you the hell alone. Maybe my guild
tag helps me there, but I'm sure half the people on the server have no idea
who my guild is or what we do. And those people die too. ;-)
