I renew then cancel my subscription every time (self renewing charges annoy
me so I wont put up with them) . I have never received an email (of course i
tend not to give out my email either ;).

I suspect that very soon EVERYONE who wants back will get a VERY warm
welcome. Whether they will want you to reaffirm the old charges is up for
debate though.
