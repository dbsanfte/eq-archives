It might also be a situation like this.   A melee class just dinged to a
new level.  Since dexterity affects the rate you learn melee skills,
they might put on some +dex gear to help max their abilities in weapon
skills quicker. Ie, +dex so you can max 1hs, 1hb and piercing quicker,
and then switch back to which ever does the most damage.  I have seen
people switch to things like a tentacle whip to raise 1hs quickly even
though the damage output is very low, the low delay will help you attack
faster, hence more swings of the weapon, hence more chances for a skill
up.
