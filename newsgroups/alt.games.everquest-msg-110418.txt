OK, I remember reading that one now that you mention it.
My temp folders are always alternate drive letters (in case C: gets killed
by Windoze).
Now if any program (all installed to C: for reason that I wipe C: and only
wipe software installs) ever messes with another folder on another drive,
then I may consider not using it any more.  I'd consider that more like
entering someone else's house and messing with their stuff without having
permission to even enter.  Where I'd consider your C:\TEMP more like messing
with stuff belonging to someone in your household without their permission.
Sure EQ messing with C:\TEMP is wrong, but D:\TEMP is even more wrong.  Now
say (MappedNetworkDrive):\TEMP is FAR worse...I'd almost definitely call it
quits if this were to happen often.
