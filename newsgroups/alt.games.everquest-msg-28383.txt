    That last sentence is actually two points. Many of these zones are VERY
poorly designed. You go on to cite Droga, which was designed to get people
to stop camping zone lines. Yet at ALL levels, players have shown that they
feel most comfortable doing exactly that because the cost of death is too
high for them. Look at Velk's - a zone with XP to 60 AND a campable zone
line. It's packed. Look at Howling Stones - mostly empty, because they made
the place BYOG. So trying to force people to "think" one way is useless, as
they'll simply pack those areas that work with their view of acceptable
risk.

    But there's also the hassle factor. Right now, I don't NEED to go to
Droga to pick up an Idol of the Thorned. There's plenty of people in EC
willing to trade me one, or sell it to me. It is EASIER for me to level up,
picking up coin and items along the way, in zones I feel are at an
appropriate risk level, THEN purchase the Idol. As opposed to camping the
Idol, being creamed several times and wasting valuable time doing
complicated CRs, then trying to make back the XP. The farmers are doing ME a
favour by doing something I'd HATE to do myself - camp gear.

    Perhaps this is what they want to change with Luclin - make players camp
their own gear, and get rid of as much of the massive auction crowd as
possible. Make it so people trade items of equal value for personal use,
rather than purchase gear "above" them. Then, VI could REALLY tailor a zone
to the level of the people who will be there, as they'd have a much stronger
idea about what gear/capabilities people of that level would have.

    But the fact is, this is too late. There's a TON of gear that does not
have the Warrens code protecting it from farmers, which is already good
enough to take someone to the point of obtaining No Drop "end game" items.
We twink just fine without the next round of "kewl lewt". And if there IS
something that is so out of line with what we can twink that we have to have
it, we'll bring a lower-level friend or guildmate and PL the hell out of
them while farming it. So it'll take all of TWO people where before one
sufficed, and now one of those people will level at a much higher rate.
Personally, I've heard more people in-game get angry over a PLer taking over
a prime spot as opposed to a farmer....

    And twink items always outclass drops at low levels. Where they don't
you have a SERIOUS imbalance issue - not that imbalance ever stopped VI
before (3 INT cloak in the Warrens).

    It frustrates me, personally. I don't have the character slot open to
create a Vah Shir on my server, so I wasn't going to do that. But I WOULD
have liked to wander around and see the sights. Then I heard the mode I play
in - small screen - would be wiped out by Luclin, no option to keep it. Then
I hear that despite the fact these mobs will undoubtedly aggro on ME and
attack ME, that I can't get anything interesting off them because "I'm at no
risk". If I was at no risk, I could go AFK and not worry about coming back
to a corpse recovery - so SOMEBODY doesn't understand what "no risk" means.
I'm with you - I have enough to explore with RoK and Velious that I see no
need to purchase SoL, and indeed I feel I'm being actively persuaded to NOT
get it.
