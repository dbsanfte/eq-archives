I'd tend to agree with the earlier statement about NWN... but then, it's a
fairly ambitious project, and I think BioWare's proven that they don't want
to release buggy crap into the marketplace, unlike, say, Funcom. =) (Note:
I'm disappointed that Funcom didn't do well... AO had a hell of a lot of
potential.)

If you'd attended E3 last year, and seen the piss-poor booth that Shadowbane
had to offer, you'd agree with Lum, and me, in saying that it'll never come
out. Shadowbane is vaporware. I will only believe that it is being released
when I see the game on store shelves and live servers running. Anybody with
an eye for design and half decent skills with a high-end graphics package
can make beautiful 3D scenery. Screenshots that have no content behind them
are meaningless. The videos I saw at E3 on the 20" monitors (You'd think if
Shadowbane was actually going to be "The Next Big Thing"(tm), that their
video of the game "in action" would be on a screen larger than 20", and
wouldn't be stuffed in the very back of the booth space, hidden behind cheap
CO2 machines and a few old tree branches.

Trust me on this one. Shadowbane will never see the light of day.
