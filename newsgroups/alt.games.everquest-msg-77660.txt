Just as a lark, picking up one of the many many elemental binders that
drop and rot there.

Not that I really wanted to play the character, I just did it to see if I -could-

Don't you ever do stuff with throwaway characters for the fun of it?

One of these days I'm making up a lowbie Iksar Shaman and running to
Karnors just to pick up my weight in Jarcrap... it was often painful
for me as a high 30s cleric to see it rotting cause it won't fit a dwarf...
and I can wear plate.  For a shaman, who can only wear chain, it must
be even more "da bomb"
