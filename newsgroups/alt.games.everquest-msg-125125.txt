Looking the other way does more to ruin my experience than taking less
than a minute to report it. Especially when I get to witness something
being done about it. Jackasses around who think they're too good to
follow the rules irritate me.

Sorry, I'm not going to look the other way when I see people
exploiting. Just like I'm not going to look the other way when I see a
bunch of kids IRL spraypaining their names on the building next door.
