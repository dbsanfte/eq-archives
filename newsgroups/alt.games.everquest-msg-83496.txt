Well, actually, I deliberately chose to put the link in that way, as that
takes you to the English language version of their home page.  I was not in
any particular hurry, and I was not trying to make an argument one way or
the other.  If you prefer, you can go to http://www.lokari.com, and then,
assuming you don't read Finnish (I presume it's Finnish), click on the In
English link to get to the page I originally referred people to.  I was not
arguing one way or the other at the time, merely posting the information
that I found with a google search on the name Lokari.  Personally, I don't
really care if she does or does not have a character by that name, if she
does, I believe that it is technically in violation of the rules, and she
could, conceivably be made to change that name as a result.  I would not go
to the trouble of petitioning it, as I don't believe that it was
intentional, and it would not in way interfere with my enjoyment of the
game.  OTOH., a name like Chrysler, would stand out like a sore thumb to me.
Quite possibly, there are those that would find the name Lokari to be
objectionable on those grounds, and I leave it to them to petition the name,
if it exists in game.
