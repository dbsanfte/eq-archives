There really is no such thing as a "Battle Cleric". The closest anyone
could come is to twink with high AC gear, Haste, and a powerful
weapon. Even with the best gear they would still not generate enough
damage per second once they hit the low-mid 20s to be efficient. By
that point all of the real melee classes and hybrids will have
additional skills like Dual Weild, Double Attack, Parry, Block, etc.
That is not even taking into account the better melee damage tables,
and primary hand bonuses that clerics do not have access to. The only
Priest class that could get away with this strategy is the Shaman
(slows, DoTs, Regen, pet).

>Is this a joke or the real thing?  

It's real, but you don't want to rely on one in a group.

Generally, and when the crap hits the fan they are OOM.

>And finally, how effective are they?

They can be effective at taking a beating. :-) In a caster heavy group
a cleric could tank long enough for the big nukers to kill the mob by
using roots, stuns, and flash of light to keep agro off the casters.
Not as efficient as having a real tank by any stretch.

That's the kicker. If the group is killing mobs so efficiently that
the cleric is always near FM, then there is no harm in nuking or
meleeing to keep skills maxed.

I don't see how that could work 	at all. Mobs hit for near max
damage if you are sitting. It would seem to me that you will take a
terrible beating trying to get the extra med time.

Not worth it to you based on down time. You could still solo for exp,
which is more than many classes can do at those levels.
