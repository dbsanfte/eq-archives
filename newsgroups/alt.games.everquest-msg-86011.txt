This isn't about druids complaining they can't port to the nexus, this is ME
saying that there's no way in hell I'm going to wait in line for a fucking
port just so I can go sell my shit to other people in the "preferred" zone,
when I can just pop on over to WC, run for 2 minutes and have my shit on the
auction block while you're still waiting on the damn spires to fire.

Somebody at VI had their heads up their collective asses when they thought
that making *everybody* wait for the fucking port was a *good* idea.
