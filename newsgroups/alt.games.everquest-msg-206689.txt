so i'm a magician... when i hit lvl 20 i trained my Evocation Specialization
to 50. now i'm lvl 30 and it hasn't budged and my guild master won't let me
proctice it anymore. i've even purchased my original lvl 1 burn spell again
so i could try working it more. my normal evocation advanced but not my
specialization. yes i even gave in and put one practice point into all of my
other specializations, cause someone said i had to, i know i don't have to
but i'm stuck. do i have to be a higher lvl before it will advance beyone 50
?

please help and thank you for your time ;-)
