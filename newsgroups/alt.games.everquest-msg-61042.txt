I've found as of late that the wisps rarely drop a GLS.  Mostly Lightstones
and burned out lightstones now.  In the past 30 or so wisps I've killed I've
gotten 1 GLS.  I usually level up from 4 to 15 or so in EC and WC.  I've
done 4 characters there now and only my first character back in early summer
ever got any decent % of GLS from the wisps.  He would get one every 3 or so
kills.  Now I'm lucky to get 1 every 30 kills.  Just letting you know that
the drop rate is crappy now IMHO.
