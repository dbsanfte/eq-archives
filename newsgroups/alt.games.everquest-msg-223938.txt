Actually, I can answer this WITHOUT flames.....
Yes there is a way to LEGALLY play EQ without paying for an account....
Get a job with Sony/Verant as a Game Master. Becoming a guide will not
get you a free account, but a GM is a paid employee of Sony.  Of course,
your character can not actually play much, since it is your job to help
others
and to sit around waiting for needy players to help.
