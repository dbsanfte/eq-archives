Be that as it may, whatever M$ chose to use of the norton code, it doesn't
appear to do as good a job, and it doesn't move the swap file to the beginning
of the disk and optimize it link SpeedDisk does. This might be because M$ does
not believe in fixed swap files, but it's been a long time since I've respected
the "wisdom" of M$; however, the fact that you can still set a fixed swap file
shows that M$ knows a lot of people would sacrifice them under a full moon if
they took that option out.
