i claimed the above action would be of the same calibur as connecting
to a different machine - in both cases, a mutation of the software i
paid for that i'm arguing does not amount to copyright infringement
and that you, for your reasons, are arguing does amount to copyright
infringement

the reason i'm saying it's not copying is because i'm not actually
making any copies - i'm using the same software i paid for

i'm not sure why you're saying putting the software i paid for to a
different use is infringing copyright (by copying, distributing,
performing publicly, etc)

before we go around in circles, please explain to me why you're
repeating the same "yes, you are infringing copyright" ... drill it
home for me, because clearly i'm dumb as can be

it can't be that simple if someone as dumb as i can't get it...please
explain

i'm asking you earnestly to explain to me *why* putting copyrighted
work to a new, private use, is copyright infringement

you only say that because you assume i'm doing something wrong

why isn't it "morally decrepit" for someone to sell you something and
then tell you that you can only use that product the way they say?

what if you bought a meal, and had a bite and didn't like it, and
decided to spice it up? you paid for it, right? can't you put mustard
on your watermelon if it tastes good to you? you paid for it, it's
yours! so what if the box says "you can't do anything other than shove
this down your throat" ??

doesn't bullying seem at all "morally decrepit" to you?



maybe that analogy doesn't do anything because it's not based around
intellectual property...

so what if you were watching a tv show you bought on DVD and didn't
like the ending ... are you saying you'd be violating copyright to
copy the DVD to your hard drive and re-edit it, changing some of the
scenes and doing your own voiceover work so the guy gets the girl or
whatever?

think about that and answer me ... where's the copyright violation?
you aren't selling it, you aren't displaying it publicly, you aren't
making copies (you're using the copy you paid for) ... blah blah blah,
whatever the statute says, you're not doing that ... and screw the
company who says "you can't do what the law says you can do because we
SAY you can't and you're going to listen to us like the sheep you are"

please consider me the dumbest possible person and explain to me where
the violation of copyright law exists


...and use little words~
