Put all your gear in the bank except for a cheap (and therefore disposable) hand
drum.

Now you can go for it, risking nothing but a triffling small amount of exp
should you meet with an unfortunate interruption to the trip.

Kithicor forest is a very dangerous place between 7pm and 7am game time.. not
that you can't cross it by turning to the right and staying high on the wall 95%
of the time, but there -are- some very scary undead in there.  Normally they
don't path within aggro range of someone running high on the wall, but if
someone comes thru and is sloppy they can aggro the mobs over that way, and then
either lose them by outrunning them, or by zoning, or by dying in place...
leaving the mobs hanging about ready to snare the unwary.  "Safe" way is to wait
for daylight, but at bard speed, with an open eye and any luck at all you'll be
able to bypass anything that does get in your way.

Running thru Highhold Pass will be scarier, since you'll be going thru with it
deserted, and you won't be invisible.  Frankly, its a bit of a maze, and
peppered with Orcs on one end and Gnolls on the other, get a good train of them
behind you and end up in a dead alley and thats one quick trip back to your
spawn site.

Therefore, I personally would reccomend the southern route:

Freeport NRo, Oasis, SRo, Innothule, Ferroot, Rathe Mountains, Lake Rathe, SK,
NK, WK, QH and thence to Qeynos.  Its a longer run, both more zones and longer
ones (in some cases) but its vastly safer.  Oasis -might- trip you up if you run
headlong into a sand giant or spectre, Rathe Mountains is a little bit of a maze
(but nothing compared to Highhold Pass) and you'll have to learn to swim to
cross LR in any kind of time (or levitate over it if you want to make use of
your full selo speed...) but all in all its nearly risk free and not all that
time consuming for a bard.
