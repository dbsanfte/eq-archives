When the EQ client tries to log onto a server and is waiting for a
response, the computer can appear to freeze. Until the client gets the
ok from the server or decides that no response is forthcoming, it
won't do anything. This was my experience.

If you can Ctrl-Alt-Del and get the task manager then your computer
has not locked up and the problem resides in what the client is doing
(or waiting for).

I don't know if this is relevant but the latest XP service pack from
MS (I believe) installs a firewall. This firewall will interfere with
EQ when it tries to connect to the game and will ask if it should
allow the connection to go forward. If you have the warnings turned
off or didn't tell it to let EQ connect, you may now have to adjust
the firewall settings to let EQ connect.

Some info on your cpu, clock speed, anount of RAM, and connection type
(dialup or broadband) would have been helpful.
