They only did that the once though. I deleted my 24 dark elf on FV
test and made a shaman barbarian. It did not get the 24 level even in
several days of logging on and off. So its up to 6 now.

I'm glad though actually, I was testing how fast and easy it is to get
a barbarian shaman to level 6 knowing what I know now. Its
surprisingly fast really if you know where you are in the canyons near
town which have an INCREDIBLY high density of spawns and spawn rate.
Really this is one of the best newbie areas except for getting lost. I
even saved all the bone chips I got, bought out all the stores so I
actually got through all of level 5 and dinged at 6 doing the qeynos
pally guild "crush the undead" quest with the 65 or so bone chips I
banked before I ran to qeynos. I did not even get touched at level 6
running through BB either ;)

I think I might go barb shaman. Its not the best shaman really, but
its best for this server since its the only one that can be Neutral
(starts as one neutral but can be plain neutral at 10 with /alignment
) Neutral means you can group with any alignment and you receive no
plus or minus to xp nor do they and you can be casted on or cast on
any align also. Basically I think everyone that can be neutral will be
if they are aware of that. An evil troll could not be bound by a good
high elf but could be bound by a neutral shaman or druid or something.

I still don't get how the guild thing will work but neutral will be
the best for joining any type of guild you want to also possibly.

Of course I guess a troll or iksar shaman would have an excuse when
people wanted sow or buffs and were good.
