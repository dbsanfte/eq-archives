*Replying to this post, as the one Dark Tyger is replying to still hasn't
shown up on my server.*

A couple of  tricks for identifying what Verant classifies as an animal is
either:

1) Our lowbie spell "sense animal". In Lavastom, for instance, it usually
finds a "lava basilisk". From what I've seen so far, on animals that show up
with "sense animal", other animal spells will work.

2)Panic Animal from a distance (you've probably got the higher version, I'm
still a lowbie druid though). If it casts, it's an animal. If it doesn't, no
harm done.

I was in WC the other night and saw a charmed griffin fighting another
griffin. At first I thought it was a high level mage pet, but when it later
turned and ate the druid nearby I realised what I'd just seen =)

On a completely off-topic note, High level mage pets scare the shit out of
me. I was in NoRo and ran into two sandgiants as I crossed over a dune.
Turned out to be a guidmeeting with some high level mages attending.  Also,
if you are a enchanter running around WC at night as a Werewolf, and come up
behind me and say "Hail a tasty halfling", you should be ashamed of
yourself. =)  It's that kinda thing that really gets a lowbies adrenaline
going.
