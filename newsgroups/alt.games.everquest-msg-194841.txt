Haste is a buff.  Buffing isn't done during fights.  Haste is admittedly an
annoying buff to keep on top of due to its short duration, but being haster
won't interfere with your ability to heal, just might contribute to down time
between fights.

I also didn't mean to imply that shaman should be doing CC in the "min/max"
group I described.  The idea was that CC is unneccesary if you have broken the
camp or have a good single puller.  While I've certainly seen shaman on CC duty
(root parking and/or using slow and dog-dog to tank mez) this isn't an ideal use
of mana.  Not pulling more than one mob at a time is more mana efficient than
spending mana parking them or healing your offtank.  Only really efficient way
I've seen to pull more than one (in a non AE group) was a druid friend of mine
who would bring mobs in and park them in a row near us, each rooted and dotted,
so they were half dead by the time we got to them.  This made good use of her
epic clicky DOT, which for the price of casting root wasn't inefficient at all.
Probably wouldn't work too well in POP though.

This leaves the shaman doing just slow and heal duty.  Outside of POP or with a
relatively high level group compared to the level of POP mob you are killing,
this really shouldn't be a problem.  As I said elsewhere, if its hardcore mobs
you are facing relative to your group, two healers may well be in order... or
perhaps now you are better off again with the enchanter/cleric model.
