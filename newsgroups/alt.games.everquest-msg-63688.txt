Then why did they do something so stupid as to risk lost revenues by
temporarily withdrawing Velious before the release of SoL?

Not saying that you're wrong, just that when they withdraw a popular, well
selling item from the market just before a major release, it just might make
one think that SoL might possibly come with Velious included.  An incorrect
assumption, but a possibly logical one considering the marketing strategy of
withdrawing SoV while it was still selling well..
