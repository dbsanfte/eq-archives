Corflunk usually spawns north of the road between xroads and Gfay, Zarchoomi
also spawns here. Corflunk seems to spawn at 7am EQ time and upon his death
Zarchoomi sometimes spawns. If Corflunk lives long enough Zarchoomi will
sometimes spawn as well. You will see Corflunk every EQ day and only once
and Zarchoomi spawns once in every 3 or so Corflunks. From 10 months
experience there are no placeholders nor set pattern to Zarchoomis spawn.
You just need to get lucky. If you kill Corflunk then run around a bit and
try and find her ugly ass
