750pp per hour?  Let's assume 20pp off your average hill giant (there are
lot of poor HGs remember).  That means you're killing 37.5 HGs every hour or
one every 96 seconds.  Do HGs even spawn at that rate?  And it can be done
in competition with all the other little doggies and finger wigglers running
around the mountain top, not to mention the exp groups?
