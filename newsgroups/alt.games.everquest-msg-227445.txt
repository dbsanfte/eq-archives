I'm a bit late coming to this thread, but better late than never.

For some reason I've never gotten around to playing a male character in
EQ. I suspect I would have if I weren't married.  Some of my favorite
characters back in the day were male.  One of my female friend's even fell
in love with my guy...and he ignored her and chased her best friend. Now
*that* was a hoot. ^_^  

I do have plans for EQ2 though...I can say them here because this is a
relatively small community, all in all.  I'm going to make an ugly old
ratonga man (mage-type?), and my husband is going to make a really sexy
dark elf chyck named Mouse (rogue).  THe idea being that the ratonga is
delusional, dumb, and self-centered, and orders the dark elf around (he
thinks she's his servant) while the dark elf makes fun of him and steals
all his stuff.  We can't *wait* until people start hitting on my husband.
:D And I'm going to have a hoot playing a mean old geezer (I get to call
my husband names in public, what isn't to love about that???).

Why can't I do something like this in EQ?  *sigh* I dunno, but it just
seems like I have a hard time immersing, so I've given up trying. Save all
that roleplaying goodness for a fresh new world.
