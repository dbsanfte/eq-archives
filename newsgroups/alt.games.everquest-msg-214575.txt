Casters, as always, are the bane of Monks existence.

What about the supreme physical conditioning, the knowledge of rolling with 
a blow, and the other factors that a Monk should have?

Agreed.

Sometimes I think SOE does this on purpose- they balance things over the 
whole timeline of the game, rather than trying to balance things within the 
status quo. "Harmony worked too well for too long. Now it should be 
useless." comes to mind.

This is where my LFG problems started cropping up, and as time went by they 
got worse. I've said it before, I'll say it again... While other classes 
were getting insane archery bonuses, self only mana regens, and kickass AA 
abilities, Monks got a big fat shit sandwich in the shape of an AC nerf.

Well, agreed, but at this point 46 is all I can talk about :)
