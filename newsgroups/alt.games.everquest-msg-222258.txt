Here is a suggestion for all the newbies and even some of the veteran
players.  When I used to play my Barbarian Warrior the easiest way to raise
his Bind Wounds skill was to travel to Lavastorm Mountains and take baths in
Lava.  I found this to be a much safer way of losing HPs then trying to
drown myself.  Be sure to bring plenty of bandages.

Of course if you are a good race and your level or lack of skills prevent
you from safely getting by the Dark Elf guard in Nektulos Forest then you
may want to wait until you are a bit older.
