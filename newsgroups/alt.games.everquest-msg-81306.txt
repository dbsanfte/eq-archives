Ok, I am now an Iksar Beastlord at level 20, and most everthing in FoB
cons green or blue, with the rare Iksar Manslayer that cons black
(very rare). I used to hang out just outside Kurns Tower which I
consider a nice area from 15-19, especially with a group.

Well I headed out to the Lake of Ill Omen and started /shout'ing I was
around, and looking for a group. After an hour of doing this and not
seeing even one Iksar zone from West to LOIO it became apparent that
everyone was either too far away, and that no one wanted to party with
an Iksar Beastlord? I am not sure.

What I want to know is what do I have to do to join/find a group? Do I
need to wonder close to FV, or what is called the "Mill" and beg for a
party? I have 100+ in sense dir and have maps and have gotten around
fairly well in LOIO, but am not sure where to go to find others to
party with. Please advise, as I am ready to throw my hands up here.

If anyone wants to form a party let me know.
