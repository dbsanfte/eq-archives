>> I do not understand why the United States
 permits public radio hosts to have
 web sites like http://www.halturnershow.com .<<

>>>SNIP<<<

>>Even though the USA guarantees free speech,<<

Actually, you just answered your own question right there. The US
Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, as long as it does not endanger
human life (the whole shouting fire in a crowded theater scenario).

Think about this: I'm a member of the US Army, which means I defend his
right to freedom of speech, regardless of my personal feelings. Even bigoted
morons have rights, and I'm here to make sure he keeps them.

Talk about irony.
