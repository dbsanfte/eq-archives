It certainly wouldn't fit my empirical evidence from this weekend. I
tend to do a lot of assassinate missions (more fun for me) and I got 4
assassinate missions right off the bat this weekend. At most I think I
turned down 2 rescue or low collections before getting them and at
least 2 were first try. 

If anything, maybe they're making it so there's a bigger likelyhood of
getting an adventure type that not many people are trying. I could see
them tracking overall attempts but I doubt that they keep track of
adventure types for each player. If they are doing it that way,
everyone else please stay away from assassinate! <g>
