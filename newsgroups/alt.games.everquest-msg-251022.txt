I am hoping you will tell me that a laptop like this will be able to run EQ
!

the laptop configuration is;
Dell Inspiron 8000
P III 700 MHz
ATI 32 MB, M4............(I know this is iffy)
256 RAM
{new} 40 GIG Hitachi travel star 5400
Windows XP Professional new install with SP 1 and all the updates

Reason I ask is that when I try to run game it get to just b4 the game start
and then says that can't find client server or something similar?
I am on Verizon DSL with a linksys router/access point  BEFW11S4, and it
happens when the cat 5 cable or the PC wireless card is in...?

Oh BTW, it has run EQ in the past so I am thinking that I got something out
of order when I did the XP Pro install ..it had ME b4.

Any ideas for me to try, please?
