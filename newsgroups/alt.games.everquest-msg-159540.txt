   Ok.  I take it back.  I didn't mean it as an insult.  I thought that
the zek insult was "carebear" servers.  Guess I'm more educated now. 
But still, FV is not a normal blue server.  It's not necessarily
better.  The one character rule, and little that is no-drop, that is
better.  The melee for all bind rules, and the TLC, that is worse.  I
haven't been on every server, of course, but I have been on quite a
few.  The "culture" on FV is more to my liking.  I can see why others
would never even consider "living" in such a place.

Yes, I want a sammich! Give me one.  NOW!
