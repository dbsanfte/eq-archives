I know we've got several EMarr folks here, and
many of 'em are pretty high level.

I would like a Mrylo BP for my rogue alt. She's
not a twink alt (she's 51, ferchristssake), but
she needs to work on her defense skill.  Only
way to do that is solo, and that heal on the Mrylo
is great.

I'm offering 50kpp for one (in-game plat, not RL
plat...go eBay somebody else ;-)  ) as well as
a 4 kpp finders fee if you lead me to a successful
sale.

Thanks!
