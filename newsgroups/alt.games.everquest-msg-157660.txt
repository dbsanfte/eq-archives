"Screams of agony were heard throughout Norrath today when it was
learned that lesser succor and all other 'port to safety' spells were
altered to port the caster, his or her group, any guildies or friends
no matter whether they were in the zone or not, online or off, into
Sleeper's Tomb, naked, blind, slowed and with both arms removed.  When
questioned, game designers said 'We really felt we had to remove the
power of the spell, people were using it to level too easily...'"
