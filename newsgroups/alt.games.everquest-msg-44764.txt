A friend suggested that since I had to reformat my harddrive (havent been
able to get on EQ after installing my new video card), that I ought to
consider setting up at least two partitions and put Windows in the primary
partition and EQ in the extended partition.  Any thoughts on this and has
any one tried it?

Further, any words of advice or warning on reformatting harddisk?

Bob
