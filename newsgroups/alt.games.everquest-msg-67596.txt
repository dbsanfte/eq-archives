Is anyone running Luclin with all the options turned on?  

How well does it run and what kind of a system do you have?  

Are the socials for the new models worth seeing?  

I have 768Mb RAM and the options screen still suggests I turn off some options
including socials.  How much RAM do you need to run this thing with everything
on?  Is 1Gb enough?  2Gb?  

Anyway, I think I figured out what Verant is spending our money on.  Hardware. 
They must have had to get all new machines for their staff.
