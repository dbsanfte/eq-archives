Usually grouped with a 65 Warrior with around 50 AAs,I would
say he has some problems getting aggro compared to SKs and Pallies.
On the bright side,I noticed his health bar dropping much slower
compared to SK/Pally tanks,even if these are higher level,have better
gear or more AAs.
But really its not a big difference which would make me prefere one
over the other classes in everyday xping/adventuring.
No idea about raid tanking,though it seems to me I see much more
Warriors tanking Bosses than,hm lets say 1 or 2 years ago.
