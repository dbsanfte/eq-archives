My enchanter has only one more piece before I finally get my epic.  I have
to slaughter female revenants until they drop an Essence of Vampire
(uncommon but not rare drop).   My guild averages around 45 but most of them
are new to raiding and I wanted to get my piece, no muss, no fuss, no
dealing with newbies.

So a friend (another enchanter, she just needs Fear) and I gather up 18
people 55+ to simply FARM Hate for my damned piece.   We gate up to find
Dark Horizons there.  They got there 10 minutes before and they're there for
the exact same reason I am.  Damn.  Oh well, shit happens.

So we go to Fear to see if my friend's critter is up.  We get 5 critters in
camp at break-in and are making a decent dent in it, though eventually it
was going to be a wipeout because everyone was out of mana.  I was ported
away and ran back towards camp but stopped where I thought I was outside
aggro so I could die without adding to their problems.  Unfortunately I
miscalculated and wiped them a little earlier than necessary.  Still, we
cleared probably 8 critters before wiping (epic cleric was able to camp),
and from all I've heard that's excellent.

Turns out the critter wasn't up.  Damn.  A couple of clerics needed to do
Fixaflat, so instead of staying in Fear for some nice xp farming we went &
did that.

Sunday our guild did Sky for the first time and made some bad mistakes and
wasted way too much time.  Lots of tempers flared...the usual.  Nothing we
won't get over, but it was damned stressful and we had little to show for it
except knowledge gained.

On one of the wipes I found myself back in SRo when a level 10 said /ooc AC
is up!!  He's over by the dervs!"   I do a /who 40 60 and find that my
wizard (48) and enchanter (57) are the only ones in zone so I hightail it
over there, kill him swiftly, and now my wizard has a pair of jboots
(enchanter is up to run2...I'm not going to waste jboots on him)!!

After over 3 years playing, one of my characters finally has jboots!!!  I'm
seriously excited. :)  The only sucky thing is that my wizard still has
kobold hide boots and jboots aren't even better than THOSE, so I have to
take up an inventory slot.  But I'm not complaining. <g>

It made not getting epic yet MUCH easier to swallow. :)
