Or you're playing in different zones.
Here's the thing about EQ before tonight's patch:

If you were in any Velious, Kunark, Norrath zones you were fine.
If you were in SOME of the Luclin zones, you were sorta fine.
If you were in Shissar Temple (or whatever the fuck that zone off The
Grey with snakes is called), you were most certainly NOT fine.  Unless
definition of "fine" means EQGAME.EXE process has managed to allocate
1.76GB of system memory after only 2 hours.
