A easy to get and free source of light is a Greater Lightstone, I dont think
it will fit in a range slot, but it will still give out light if keep in a
top slot of your pack, I.e in an open slot not within a bag.
They are dropped by WillowWisps, both WC and that Cat island on the way to
Erudin have a ample supply of them, if you not willing to wait for one to
drop (I would say they have a drop rate of about 1 in 10 kills) just give a
shout out usually someone is hunting them.

Other items I can think of off the top of my head and at 4am are,

Foremans skull cap, Head slot,Nice stats, GLS strength light, about 40pp or
so

and a Globe of everburning something or other few resist stats LS Strength
Light, seem to go for about 20pp

Oh and most the Cleric quest necklaces are a strong Lightsource, you wouldnt
be able to wear them, but assuming you have enough faction to do the quest
you can benefit from the light if kept in a topslot.

some weapons give off a Lightsource too, I know the BABS is pretty nice, but
not much use for a Bard really =)

Sorry that wasnt really very useful ... Maybe someone else can come up with
some better suggestions
