So, what do the rest of you think of the city design?  From what I've seen
of Freeport, it appears to be done as around a dozen small zones.  So, you
spend a lot of time zoning, and it greatly reduces the "world" feeling.

On the other hand, if you are looking for an NPC in a particular one of the
zones, it is pretty easy to make sure you've searched the whole place (or
ask a guard where they, which gives you a waypoint, which takes you right to
them).  It's hard to get lost in Freeport with this design.

I kind of like that, because I find it easy to get lost in games, both
MMORPGs (EQ1 and DAoC) and FPS games (Doom, Quake).  I just don't have a
sense of direction in game worlds.  In real life, there is some way we can
sense direction.  Perhaps something to do with the Earth's magnetic field
(yes, there has been research that has suggested humans *can* sense magnetic
fields, just like some animals can), or perhaps we just subconsciously
integrate our turns to arrive at an estimate of the direction we are going.
Whatever it is, in real life, when navigating through a city, I can get
lost, but I have some general idea always where I am and what direction is
which, and whatever mechanism provides that doesn't work for me in games.
