For the gnome wizard armor, the required drop of the Kobold Scalps is
annoyingly rare.  This is the required item for all the newbie armor pieces.
So you need 21 or so of them total to get all the armor.  The Kobolds are
long green before you even get close to getting the required drops.  At
least it teaches you all about how you will be farming green mobs for
required items.
