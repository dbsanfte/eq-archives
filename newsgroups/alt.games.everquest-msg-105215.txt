Uh, no?  The first part of the feedback is accurate in saying that the level
1 and 60 don't work, you have to be 2/3d's difference or less.  However,
from "my" experience when trying to Powerlevel someone without a druid (/em
chuckle) If i have a character that is red to the low person but they still
get experience, then they get all the experience from a blue mob that was
green to the high character.  My experience is mostly done with forest
giants in warsliks woods.  I have hunted there with almost all my characters
and am very familiar with how far the experience bar moves while solo'ing
and while grouped.  The experience bar will move the same while soloing as
it will when someone is grouped with my that cons the giants as green, but I
can get experience.  I can test this myself because i have two computers and
two accounts.  The other thing to remember is that there is a max amount of
experience you can receive from a kill after level 20 (that might not be the
correct level but it is around there).  The max becomes 2 blue bubbles.  No
matter how red the creature is, you can only get so much increase on your
experience bar.

If all this is sounding like a person on pot then let me know why I am wrong
because I would hate to believe something just because of the empirical
evidence I have gathered.
