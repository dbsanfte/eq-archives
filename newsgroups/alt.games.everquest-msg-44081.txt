Go to FV, bind at the bank, tp, tp, tp, tp, tp.

Exp a lot - FM and SK are good now, as are quite a few other zones that you
have been reading about if you have been sscanning this newsgroup in the last
week. SK especially since the gnolls (easily soloable at your level) outside
Split/Infected Paw are quite frequently carrying Fine Steel weapons you can
merchant-sell for good amount of plat.

Do not expect to be buying 10kpp and up items for a very long time, those sorts
of items just simply are not in the range of anyone whose main is under at
least 35, if not 40 (and even that may be stretching it). My L31 druid has some
pretty nice stuff, but not one item over 1kpp...in fact, nothing over about
900pp, my newbie Pallie is the character with the 1kpp item (given to me by
another player, Tunare bless her, it is a SSOY, which I have no hope of getting
by myself or likely in a group for a while yet).

PB

P.S.: You are lucky to be getting 50pp for a Bracer of Erollisi, they barely
fetch 10pp on Karana.
