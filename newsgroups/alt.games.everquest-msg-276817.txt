I've been playing for almost 3 years now I think, and my main is about
to Ding 54.  My highest lvl alt is low 20s.  I guess it's obvious that
I don't dedicate myself to xp grinding.  I go through long periods
where I just wander off and solo somewhere, maybe duo if there's
someone else in zone.  When I lvl too fast, I feel I miss out on alot.
Not just practical game aspects (like buying spells/training special
abilities for the last five lvls), but I like to get to know a zone.
I love running through Burning Woods by myself in wolf form hunting
gorillas.  At lower lvls I'd solo in South Karana or Oasis, making
regular runs to the zone line to escape aviak advocets or sand giants.
I'll probably never hit the lvl cap, I enjoy playing too much.  I love
playing the lower lvls.  Hunting in East Commons and alternatly
cursing or blessing Sgt Slade depending on whether he just KS'ed me or
saved my life.
