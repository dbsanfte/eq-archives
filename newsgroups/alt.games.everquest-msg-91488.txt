Mana equals time, and as the old saying goes, time equals money.
People who contend that it's only mana should be told to go stuff
themselves, and get their lost experience back the hard way. After
all, it's only time, right?

I would certainly think so.

I generally hand out SoW for free (*), simply because I'm usually just
poking around, not making any use of my mana. But anyone who even
hints at having the "it's only mana" attitude can get lost.

(*) I cast SoW on people who I happen to come across, or do business
with, unasked. If someone actually asks me for a SoW, they'd damn well
better tag a correctly spelled "please" onto the request, or offer
money.
