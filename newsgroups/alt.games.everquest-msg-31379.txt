Semi-public(ie shared space)  Is something you work out with a
room-mate.  When I've had a room-mate, we worked out how things would be
handled when there would be "private" company before they happened.  In
one case(motel), in others,  barring the door or leaving a note or a
mark somewhere visible but not obvious.
