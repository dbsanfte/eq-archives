Yeah, would mean people can port without us druids or wizards. What
will they think of next. For enough plat, people will be able to sow
themselves before long, oh wait, they can.

I think there should be pads in the major cities to port yourself. Or
pay an npc some plat for a no rent gate stone or something, to take
into dungeon with you. 

Won't hardly affect anyone if this staff is added (except the people
who get it!). It will be uber, no drop, have to be over to 50 to use,
need a star ruby regent and all those goodies.  Hell, prolly be normal
gate to bind point, which would still be ultra sweet! however if they
add it, may as well give it unlimited charges.

When milking cash around a ring, how often does anyone gate random
folks over 55 anyways?  How often do you gate folks in thier 20's?
The customer base will still be there. So what if  a lvl 60 troll SK
doesn't have to pay you for a translocate, there are tons of others
(my twinks expeccially) who will still pay thru the nose for gates,
etc.  

I'd be completly thrilled if they make it a group gate! Even with a
Ruby or Jacinth as regent, would be incredible. But you know that
ain't gonna happen.
