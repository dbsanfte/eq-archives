I have a good friend who is a good cleric. He uses Remedy to get a caster
from his initial troubles, and then succeeds with a Cel Healing. This has
saved mine and lots of other's lives numerous times already.

But what I want to say is that a chanter, and also the cleric and possibly
others, have the ability to stun and root mobs. A succesfull stun buys a
chanter time for a re-mez and the cleric for the healing.
The most effective chanters I've seen have at least 1 stun, often 2, up for
the most immediate problems. An Atone or Memblur can then get the mob back
to where it belongs: on the tank(s); Or, of course, a mez.


Kilmir, thinking of starting a new chanter soon
