Well, I did have a 14-month period during which I just didn't own an
EQ-capable computer... I had the shakes like an heroin addict, let me
tell you.

Still, my playing style is not just mob, mob, mob, mob... I travel a lot
just for fun, and since Druids have a lot to offer, I do get to interact
a lot with other players (hence the number of guild invites I get).
Still, I prefer the flexibility of hunting of my own, and being able to
say *sod it* and do something else whenever I want, without letting down
a whole party of people.
