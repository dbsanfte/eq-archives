/nod    I haven't seen much of this on E'ci.  I've even had some ridiculous
wait times to gather enough people, without others saying "fuck it" and
leaving.   (Although there have been a few suspicious LD's.)

Don't start pitying us quite yet.   All of those classes fall into the DPS
catagory, and the time limits play directly into thier hands.   I know my
Rogue has been extremely popular, and I don't think it's because of her
dazzling smile.   Add enough DPS, and suddenly tanking, slowing and crowd
control all become less imperitive.

On E'ci, the necros are starting to come out in force.   It's nice to see
them finally learning a bit about grouping... cause they can do some pretty
nice things.   We've used them to sub in for enchanters, as well as
replacement damage production, and even slows while in the undead dungeons.

Druids looking for LDoN groups are somewhat rare on our server, or at least
so it seems from the last few days.

As far as a class getting the shaft, my vote would have to be enchanters.
Post 45, KEI will last through an entire adventure with much time to spare.
Pacify pulling appears overpowered and is eliminating much of the need for
crowd control.   Certainly enough for a bard or necro to take over.   Or
just double tank / root park the occasional add.  Leaving the enchanter with
not much beyond slows (if a shaman isn't present), hastes and poor nukes.
