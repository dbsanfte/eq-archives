Any Jewlery gem shop will have them. I have seen them in Free Port,
Kelethin, Felwithe, Kaladim, Akanon, Oggok, East Commons, West Commons,
Thugian, Neriak, and FV. I am pretty sure all gem shops have them. I never
seen them in SFG (but wasn't looking) but have in Qyenos. I never looked in
Cabalis, Halas, or Erudin either but prob. there too.. You shouldn't have to
much trouble finding them..
