I'm confused also.  It appears that you are finding a conflict between 
the bard and the necro on hotkey settings.  Does that mean the bard and 
necro have the same name so are stuck with the same hotkeys?  I didn't 
think this was supposed to be possible, but if so I see three options: 
either get used to it, or start one of them over with a different name, 
or do exactly what you've outlined.

If what you're asking is what the file names are, I believe the 
charname_servernumber.ini and charname_servernumer.opt in the EverQuest 
directory have the settings.  Copying the files to save the settings 
should indeed work.
