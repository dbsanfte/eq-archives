Theorically should be any servers.  But it's still up to SoE. You do
get a free move per toon from the merged server but expect a month or
so delay.  Took me that long to get mine off the PvP servers and there
weren't any other mergers for a while.  With the mass merging in the
next 2 months, I wouldn't be surprised if SoE ends up with a waiting
list of unfinished moves more than 2 months long.
