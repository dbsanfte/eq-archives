Seat belt laws are not just protection for the person wearing it,
though...you can kill someone else if you don't wear one by ricocheting
around a car and striking others.

And since I assume you aren't necessarily arguing on the side of the most
extreme form of freedom, ie, a society where murder/theft/destruction of
others property is legal, I would strike that one from your example. But
otherwise, aye, I rather agree that drug laws, helmet laws, and suicide
laws do begin to take start to presume what is and isn't good for someone
else.
