I'm playing with the same machine that is sold as the alienware Area-51m,
or the Sager NP-5670 (its an OEM originally made by Clevo).

I was able to get a machine with:
P4-3.06
1GB RAM
Radeon 9000 Mobility
60GB drive (5400rpm)
1600x1200 display
DVD-R/RW

for the equivalent of about US$2400.

And as expected, battery life sucks - its a desktop pentium4, and it runs hot.
