I'm a 52 Druid as well (Wood Elf), and have been seeing the same thing.
What used to give me an almost-always-reliable 1% per kill in JP is now
taking 2-3 kills to get 1-2%.  It's probably our higher level (as well as
the mentioned XP bonus).  It takes more XP per level, therefore more kills
per level of the same level mob.

I'm trying to find a new spot to solo myself.
