** UPDATE **

When we were trying the mentioned dungeon, every time he tried Pacify, they
all aggroed...tried it again last night, and it worked as intended.  It must
have been bugged the other day, as the targeted MOb was pacified, but the
others in the room all aggroed.  Who knows...anyway, seems to be working
correctly now.

Good info though, thanks.
