Wizards solo fine before getting Bonds of Force.  My first character to
get past 5 was a Wizard who pretty much exclusively soloed.  He was not
powerleveled by friends nor twinked.  Certainly other classes would have
soloed faster, but my Wizard reached level 30 at about 26 or 27 days
/played, which is not bad for a first serious character.
