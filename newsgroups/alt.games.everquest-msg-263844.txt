I'm a casual gamer (and in the EQ2 beta). So far EQ2 is perfect for my
play style.

EQ1 won't fold when EQ2 launches. You can play both as much as you
want and then decide which one you want to stick with.

Whatever your personal situation is, you will be no more time limited
in EQ2 than you are in EQ1. Same goes for any MMPORPG you play.

>And what's the death penalty like? I hate the eq dependence on a cleric rez;

All priests (Cleric, Shaman, Druid) can rez starting at Level 8. It
doesn't cost much "power" (mana in EQ2), and is quick to cast. I have
never had a problem getting a res as long as I was in a zone with
other players/groups nearby. If you can't get a res or don't want to
wait you can release and respawn with all of your gear.

When you die you earn "Exp Debt". The more you (or your group members)
die the higher the debt gets, but you never "de-level". Every
kill/quest you you earn while you have EXP debt goes towards paying it
off. This slows down your leveling a bit (kinda like spitting exp
between regular exp and AAs in EQ), but you never have to worry about
losing a level.
