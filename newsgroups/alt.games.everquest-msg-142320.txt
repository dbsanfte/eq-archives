I would gladly give up additional benefits outside high level raids for
high-level raid role.  I tire of being alone quad kiting to gain exp and

Oh and buy the way, I don't charge for ports, I don't advertise for ports
and if someone asks and I have time I will take then where ever they like.

Not all druids are the same.
