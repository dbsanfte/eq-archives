A "buff" is any spell that another player casts on you
which produces one of those icons on your screen.

For example, a SoW (Spirit of Wolf) spell cast on
you is a "buff", because it produces an icon on your
screen indicating that the spell is in effect and
that you character can now run faster (until it
wears off half an hour later, at which point the icon
goes away).

They're called "buffs" because the usual effect of such
spells is to "buff you up" -- that's the slang phrase
(perhaps it's only an Americanism) for doing exercise
workouts and getting fit, strong, and muscular.  The
analogy to Everquest spells that make your character
faster, strong, etc. should be obvious.

Some long-term spells can be cast on you which have 
negative effects (especially by creatures instead of
other players), and these are often called "debuffs".
For example, a spell that makes you weaker for a time
instead of strong would often be called a debuff.
