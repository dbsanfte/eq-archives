If you look at the old map that comes with the Velious expansion, and
look at Faydwer continent, over by Steamfont Mountains, there is
Elizerian Lake. It's also near Greater Faydark and Felwithe. This may be
a zone planned for future optional expansion., as may be Wayunder Lake,
and the city drawn next to it, Kanthok's Ridge and the Loping Plains.
