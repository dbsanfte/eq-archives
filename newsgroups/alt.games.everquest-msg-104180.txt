Yep, 30-40pp for a HQ Bear skin is correct. 30 for the quick sell,40
if you have time to wait for the right buyer. LQ and MQ pelts go for
1pp each no matter what kind (cat,wolf,bear). I can get 3-4 pp for HQ
cat but alot can't, again you need wait for the right buyer. I sell HQ
wolf for 1pp and I've not seen a buyer yet who pays more.

At one time I made a nice living off the pelt trade, much harder to do
with Rock Hopper HQ going for much less then HQ Bear. When I bought
for 30pp I always told them to wait for traders to come through as
they could get more, but due to many players time they didn't want to
wait. When/if my Tailoring skill gets high enough, I too, will pay the
40pp for HQ Bear.

Most of the rest of the pelts are being bought for the padding market,
being made into padding and then sold to Smiths making armor. HQ Cat
is a nice middle of the road pelt, size wise, for making some nice
armor. thus improving ones Tailoring skills and may be used in some of
the really good ethnic armors if I'm not mistaken.

The other thing you'll see alot of in EverFrost is the same dealers
buying HQ Bear and other pelts will want stacks of Spiderling and
Spider Silk, again related to the above mentioned things.

Currently I'm suppling pelts for a person going from about 200 skill
to 235 skill in a trade skill. This is nice, because I don't have to
worry about selling, he'll come get them whenever it's worth the trip.
This is common, not hard to set up and is worth it if you plan on
spending any time at all in zones where pelts/silks abound.
