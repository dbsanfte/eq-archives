This is no longer true, since the last series of patches.  There is now a
modifier that depends on your level and the mob level, which has not been
fully worked out by the players.  It appears that at level 60, however,
anything over 54 gets a bonus, with the bonus being higher the higher the
mob is.

However, I seem to recall reading that it is believed that none of these
changes apply to AAXP, so there, a blue mob to a 51 and a blue mob to a 60,
in the same zone, will indeed give the same AAXP.
