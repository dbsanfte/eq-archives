Chilli always works  make sure you use the tiny Thai "mouse shit" peppers 
for maximum effect.

I got some "bedroom justice" on a cheating (now EX)girlfriend where I 
crushed about 3 handfuls of chillis, strained them through chux wipes until 
the red colour was mostly gone and then placed it in her Wet Stuff (water 
based bedroom lubricant). I wish I was there to see the look on his or her 
face when it was used first.
