I agree. We couldn't sit on our asses and not do anything or what would of
happened is continued attacks upon US soil.  like pearl harbor, this was one
of the worse disasters in US history, and we found the calprits and exacted
rightful revenge.

I think the point of it is that if your going to cause us significant damage
expect to get hit significantly.  The last thing we need is to have someone
who hates us get weapons of mass destruction and then using it on us or our
allies.  The US is anything but a warmonger country.
If your going to get into a war, war is meant for two things.  To destroy
things and kill people.   You hit them with everything you got as fast as
you can and don't stop until their crying for peace and willing to do
anything for it. ( like total dismantling of their military).

I think that any news media is going to be biased.  Nevertheless, I believe
that the concern over weapons of mass destruction is genuine.  Whoever
thinks we are ousted by the UN is way out of touch.  To think that the US
doesn't have weapons of mass destruction is also out of touch with reality.
We have alot of nukes.
