You get more exp from white or yellow MOBs than from dark blue. When I
levelled from 62 to 65, the exp that I received from a particular camp
(say IC in PoV) was significantly lower - perhaps 30% slower AA.

However - I play a cleric. A cleric generally does not cast on MOBs but
on players, and the 63+ cleric spells are generally not all that useful
in exp groups. For pretty much any other class, the levels are probably
more useful.
- Melee: The MOBs will hit you for less.
- Melee: You will hit the MOBs for more.
- Melee: If you are not the tank, higher level = less level aggro.
- Casters: Your spells will be resisted less.
- Casters: More mana.
- Casters: Mana regen gets a boost at 65.
- Casters: Availability of higher-level spells.
- Everyone: You will resist MOB spells more.
- Everyone: All things being equal, most groups will pick the
  higher-leveled character when inviting.
- Everyone: More HP.
- Everyone: Availability of additional AA.

Personally I would guess that clerics are the only class for whom
sticking at 62 or 63 is a sensible choice. For melee, the difference to
mitigation in both directions is decisive. For casters, the changes to
resists and the higher-level spells matter most.

There are also some key AA for certain classes that may make stopping
for AA worthwhile. Canni5 for shamans and EQ/AM3 for rangers being the
usual examples.
