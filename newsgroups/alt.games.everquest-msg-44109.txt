Why not?  They hate foreigners so much that they're willing to die in a
gruesome burst of flaming viscera just to take a few foreigners with them.
They further believe that it is their duty to do exactly that, the
completion of said duty being rewarded by eternity in paradise.  If you
consider their mindset, we'd be HELPING them by killing them.

Perhaps it's the "round 'em up" part you object to.  How about this,
instead: Let's set up a camera and microphone inside a gas chamber, giving
continual feed onto a new TV channel (call it TBB -- Terrorists Bye-Bye?).
Nobody would be under any obligation to enter the gas chamber; it would be
clearly marked as deadly.  There would be a sign hanging over the entrance,
saying, "If you love Allah and you hate pale-skinned unbeliever capitalistic
blaspheming pig-dogs, enter and let them know!"  The fanatic gets to make
his statement of hatred, which WILL be heard (watching a terrorist die would
be more interesting by far than daytime TV), then he gets gassed.  The
fanatic gets to die in the act, guaranteeing him a place in heaven and
martyrdom back home.  The fanatic gets all his wishes, and nobody else has
to die.

If that's not enough to tempt him, let's up the ante. What if we take
death-row prisoners from American jails, throw them in a pit, and encourage
terrorists to follow? The fanatics get a chance at American blood and a
chance to die nobly in the accepted fashion, and the U.S. gets rid of
bothersome scumbags.  One stone; two birds.
