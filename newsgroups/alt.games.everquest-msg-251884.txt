depending on what race, sentient armor is great for int and an sk is an int
caster.  I used the Argent Defender and the Thoroneblade of Yeksha which has
a proc  starting at lvl 46.  Both blades were great.  If you have the cash
the Argent Protector is excelent.  No matter what wepon you start with it
wont have dammage caps removed till you hit lvl 20.  If your a Dark Elf then
stamina will always be a problem.  In that case armor that raises sta is
always a good thing especially because sks are used as tanks so often.

Cheers
