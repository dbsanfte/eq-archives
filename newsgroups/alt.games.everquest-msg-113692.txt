   On the "Arrogant Druid" thread, the conversation drifted
a bit to which class is most likely to be played by a jerk. 
Druids were of course mentioned, and wizards got an
honorable mention for past reputation.  Both the porting
classes... maybe a connection there, or perhaps not.  
   Anyhoo.  What class (or race, heck, let's have fun with
this!) currently has the rep of having the fewest jerks? 
Personally, I would nominate Troll Warriors, but then, I'm
in love with one so I may be biased.
