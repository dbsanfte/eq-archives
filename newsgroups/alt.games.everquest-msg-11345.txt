It's not an exploit, and the pet's master does not have to leave.
Fighting a blue-or-higher (to you) pet in a /duel, or in a PvP
area, will indeed give skill increases.

Even items without a "secondary use" will stick around.  The rule
seems to be, "if it's equippable, it stays even with zero charges,
if it's not equippable, it poofs".  That's why the Chipped Bone Rod
sticks around, even though it has no other use.  Also, if it's summoned,
it poofs even if it's equippable (e.g. Levitation Rings).
