Hehe...  Which is what prompted me to go to Blackburrow and watch the
Trains...  LOL  I remember just how much I hated that place.  LOL  I swear I
had nightmares about it for weeks while I was levelling there!

However, you talk about things you do at level 33...  How about this, you
attempt to cast Snare on a mob, however, you have mistargeted mob and in
fact are still targeted on yourself....  NOT that I would EVER do something
like that...  (yeah right.  Cancelled my SoW right away...  hehe)  Or, even
better, get your flame gems mixed up and instead of casting Fire Fist on
yourself, you cast Burst of Flame...  Again, I wouldn't know ANYTHING about
that...  LMAO!

There are days when I swear I'm more of a Newbie than the person that just
installed the damn game.  ;o)
