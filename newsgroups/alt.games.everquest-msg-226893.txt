Sure you can.

If you tally up all the randoms of everybody over their entire eq play 
time you will inevitably discover that some of them rolled below average 
and some rolled above average.

Surely someone who rolled below average was a 'bad randomer', and 
someone who rolled above average was a 'good randomer', at least from 
their subjective experience with it.

Both the 'law of averages' (which is an empirically based assumption not 
a theorem), and the law of large numbers (which is a theorem) work as 
the number of trials goes to infinity.

While the number of randoms 'theoretically possible' for any given 
player is pretty much unbounded. The reality is that the number of 
randoms that will actually be performed by any given player is decidedly 
finite, and even quite low.

Neither the law of averages, nor the law of large numbers make any claim 
  for bounded numbers of trials.

Fortunately there is no way to predict who will turn out to have been a 
bad randomer until the upper bound on trials becomes fixed. (e.g. 
Cancels EQ never to return)

But many of us can look at our retrospective and say I have rolled badly 
thus far. Is it really improper for such a person to say "I am a bad 
randomer"?
