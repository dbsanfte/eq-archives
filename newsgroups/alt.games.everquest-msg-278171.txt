Sure, now that you mention it. :)

As do I. However, I end up having to check them off individually as I 
purchase them. It would be nice to merely note that I'm needing six new 
spells and see that there are six spells for my level all together, 
purchasing them all at once. I could then verify them all at once as well, 
ensuring that I have all I was expecting and none are missing due to list 
discrepancies.

Also, I don't wander around PoK clicking and sifting. Naturally I begin 
with my class spell merchants and work from there. A cleric, for example, 
has a pretty good idea what other class spell merchants to check for his 
lower level healing spells (why they can't all be found on cleric spell 
merchants, I'll never know).

My point was that while it would be nice, it's not exactly necessary.
