Krommif Leg quest in GD is pretty easy with a few 46's, Coldain Wristguard
can be done too with a little help (and a Rallos Zek worshipping Troll
mule). Shroud of Nature and Acrylia Studded cloaks are dirt cheap. Coldain
Boots are possible to get, but less than 2k if you buy.

If you can get to the safe valley in UP - you may want to tag along with
some of the 53+ druids there to stack some DoTs and maybe try a root or 2.
Pretty safe place really, and you are not taking anything away from the
druids that are there. You can get the pieces that would rot anyway
(Bracers, Gloves, Legs, Arms, Boots) while the higher level druids struggle
for the rare Tunic and Crown. The exp for 46 would be awesome there as
well - if you get in the group. I was bound up on the hill there for quite a
while - saved me the run across ME ...

Chitinous Girdle is nice for less than 500, I wore Braided Ivy Cords into my
50's =).

BTW, I think you mean Celestial Temper (requires Blue Diamond) - Essence is
easy =).
