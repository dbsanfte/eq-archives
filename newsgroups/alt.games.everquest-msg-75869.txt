Anyone else ammoyed about seeing people running around called Elrrond,
Arrwenn, even Bildo Bagins?? Sheesh, have some originality guys, please.
Spoke to a couple of Guides (GM's not available ) and one idiot said, it's
not against naming policy. I said so if I want to be a wizard called
Ganndalf is that ok? He said go ahead. When I pointed out that is IS AGAINST
Verants naming policy, he told me to re-petition. Idiot.

They are only too quick to jump on people with names that are funny, should
be the same for everyone.
