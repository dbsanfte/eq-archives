But they just couldnt resist putting it on the FV server. I suppose FV will
be so popular anyway, they can throw this in and still have a full server.
To me, TLC goes against the "realness" of a role-play server. verant have
done this with other things too... like spells dropping at zonelines. Zones
should be as seamless and invisible as possible, if you want some illusion
of reality. To go and build complications like debiffing on what is a
software issue (zones) is bad thinking. Sure some zones could debuff... but
going from butcher to GF... or WF to NF? Makes no sense at all, and just
serves to remind you your playing a computer game, and its not you running
around norrath at all (. Monsters hitting you through walls etc etc etc is
another example yet again, but in fairness i dont have a good solution to
this.
