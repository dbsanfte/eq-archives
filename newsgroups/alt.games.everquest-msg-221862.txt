    guys....... I'm not whining........ SK/shammy duo is what got me out of
level 55, unable to get a group, shitty 3rd hand gear and into 65
permagrouped tell hell! (slight exxageration)

    And yup, shammies pay for their power in a lot of hideous ways. I sure
as hell don't begrudge them one bit, but they're one example of a caster so
far and away beyond any mere mortal melee you could name, while in another
thread there are 10 posts from 10 different people all coming to the
conclusion that knights..... yes...... knights...... need nerfing or
comparitive nerfing because they're stepping on warriors' toes. That's all I
was saying.

    Nerf nobody!
