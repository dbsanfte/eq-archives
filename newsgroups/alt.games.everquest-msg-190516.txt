I figure it would be best to say this to everyone.  If you responded to one
of my posts, and it seems like I have ignored you, there is a reason.

I am currently using Outlook Express as a newsreader (and yes, it -is- a
"real" newsreader, just a crappy one).  I'm still trying to get comfortable
with X-news, but I find it really doesn't fit (although it's better than
Agent).  Currently, OE decides it likes to crash on certain replies, and I
get tired of searching out the orignal post again, and re-typing all the
stuff from the first crash, so if the message crashes, it stays crashed.

Sorry if it seems I'm being rude.
