Damn, that's sucky luck.  A few weeks ago three dropped for a friendly guild
of ours but I wasn't able to get up there fast enough.  Saturday two dropped
for us.

Got my epic yesterday morning when 8 Crusaders of Plilo wandered into The
Hole while I was there (waiting for exactly this chance) and they agreed to
take me with them to kill Yael, and stop by and let me visit Polzin.

In payment I gleefully accepted Yael's DT (not often an enchanter can take a
DT <g> ).

I was an ogre much of the rest of the day 'cause the bigger you are, the
more detail the snake has.  I was clicking folks left & right. <g>

Enchanter epic is 66% haste, around 12 AC, 40 AGI & STA regen (like augment)
plus some stats only an enchanter would care about.  It can be cast on, I
BELIEVE, anyone (I cast it on some 30s, didn't try casting it in a newbie
zone...YET)

I'm still grinning. :) It's been a very long year.
