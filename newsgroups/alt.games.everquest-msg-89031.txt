If its just a 4 person group of friends, they won't be fighting anything
"uber" that requires a warrior.

Using the classes you listed with a lil change, I would say
Monk+Cleric+Wiz+Chanter
Monk = a pretty good tank, and much better melee damage then a warrior (I
can tank ToV mobs all fight and Im a monk)

Or maybe monk+cleric+wiz+shaman (instead of chanter).  Theres a lot to be
said for shaman slow.

Wizards are wasted in single group 1 mob at a time fights, so a ranger or a
rogue would be better.

So maybe monk+cleric+shaman+ranger... for more damage, go with
monk+cleric+shaman+rogue.   No snarer? Well make the cleric a dark elf

The point is theres so many successful combinations, and I don't really
think theres any right or wrong combination if some friends just wanna group
and kill some stuff
