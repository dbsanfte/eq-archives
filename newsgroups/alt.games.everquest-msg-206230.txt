Graeme is correct here, FoL isn't useful for classic fear kiting, where you
melee a mob that doesn't fight back because its running.

If you are using fear to send a mob away so you can nuke it, and fear it on
the way back in, FoL tends to do -that- job very well indeed, as long as you
stay out of melee range.

I've even had some luck using FoL in combination with a pet, with taunt off,
the mob seems to ignore the pet and wander around blindly looking for me
instead.  This beats hate kiting (with an unsnared mob) because I can med
while the mob wanders.

FoL also has a short duration and the mobs don't tend to run purposefully,
like they do with Fear; for -this- sort of "yo yo" kiting, FoL is superior
to a serious long duration fear; its rarely resisted, mobs don't move away
all that well, and its over quickly so they come back for another dose of
blind and nuke.

Sadly, I have to report that the Clinging Darkness neck isn't really all
that and a bag of chips; that's a six second cast time on it, its frequently
resisted, the snare isn't really all that much of a snare in terms of
slowing mobs down, and its duration is pitifully short.
