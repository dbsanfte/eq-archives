There should be a quick way to change weapons in the game. Its not
real life, its a game. In NWN, I can press one key and switch
weapons. It would seem that there would be a single key method of
doing it in EQ as well.

Hmm. Try watching history channel, you can, if properly trained
switch weapons quickly in real life.
