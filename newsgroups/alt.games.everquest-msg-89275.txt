Basically everything that wanders around on the top of the hill in the
middle of the Hill Giant valley (Rathe Mountains) is a Hill Giant
Placeholder.  Basilisks, lizards, giant skels, cyclops...  If somebody
kills those, there will be plenty of Hill Giants spawning.  If nobody
is killing those, then the Hill Giant spawns will peter out.

I spent some time there with my level 60 ranger leveling my low-40's
druid.  I just wandered around on the top of the hill killing
everything that moved, and plenty of HG's spawned.  Plenty for me and
for the other hunters in the zone.  

As I recall when we used to hunt there in my 30's-40's, it was a real
pain to try to kill the basilisks and lizard men, because they would
run and randomly teleport around the zone.  I think the pathing in
that zone has been fixed since then, though, since I didn't have any
trouble (granted now they don't really have time to run, since they go
down in a couple swings ;-P

Anyway, the HG spawn rate isn't really a function of how many people are
hunting them, it's a function of how many people are killing the
PH's....
