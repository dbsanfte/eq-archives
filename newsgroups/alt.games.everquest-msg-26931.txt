I can understand that ~ as a shaman who always assumed the role of primary
healer in lieu of a cleric I ended up giving up on grouping altogether. I
solo almost exclusively now apart from occasional duo/trio combinations with
close friends.

The problem I came up against is that a _lot_ of people expected to always
be buffed to the eyeballs when in the same group as a shaman, even if that
shaman is wearing the "primary healer hat" as well.

I got weary of explaining the situation:

"Static camp them puller/tank (normally same person at low levels) get's sow
and regen, everyone else pretend I am a cleric. Dynamic or dangerous camp
everyone gets sow and then my butt assumes the cleric position*...and in
case you haven't notice, this aint plate I am draped in. If it takes you 2
seconds to get a mob off a cleric then you better take 1 with me..."



*assuming the cleric position: to the overly imaginative this actually
refers to planting ones butt on the ground and meditating. This is EQ - not
real life, so choir boys do not enter into the equation at all...
