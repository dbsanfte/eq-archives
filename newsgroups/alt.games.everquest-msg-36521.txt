I found the best experience a few nights ago with my 10 cleric was just having
one other person in the group, she was a level 13 shadow knight.  We hunted
everything we could find in WC, kodiaks were the roughest but we never died and
we both hit our next level, 11/14 respectively.  It was very impressive
experience, probably got half of level 10 in around an hour. The trick is to
conserve your mana to reduce down time, and constantly constantly pull.  If you
can find a place that has mobs white/yellow/red to you and you get a really
decent tanking partner, and the pathing allows for good fighting and resting,
that's where you want to be.  All these other suggestions are specifics, but you
need to find out for yourself which areas you can deal with the best.  This is
the criterion for finding those areas.  So grab a buddy with a sword and some
armor and start leveling like you're actually enjoying the game :)
