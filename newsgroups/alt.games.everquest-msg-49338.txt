Look, someone who can be reasonable in his disagreements!  Look and learn!

You're right that it's not the same rush, but it is a related rush.  FPS
games can be just as intense, esp. since you can quickly build a rivalry
with someone and there's a nice thrill from getting them before they get
you.

As for single player games,  I've gotten that same intense rush all the way
back to Dungeon Master on my atari st.  While it's true you can try over and
over, coming across something that you didn't expect and that can kill you
can make you jump right out of your chair.

There are a lot of factors which can make a game immersive, and "time loss"
is one of the cheapest and easiest.  It's also the most frustrating, so I'd
rather play a game that didn't focus on it quite as much as EQ.
