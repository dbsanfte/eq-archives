If they don't nerf the ability to change your appearance at will, this 
won't really help make grouping a PITA, it will only be a small nuisance 
to everyone but the hard core RPers who don't actually want to alter 
their looks every time the wind changes.

Of course its entirely possible that they stealth nerfed that ability 
some time ago, since although I'm not a hard core RPer, I care so little 
about my appearance that I never did change it in the first place!
