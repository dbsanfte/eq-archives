I just had this problem and so I thought I would pass this along just in
case.  I recently had to reload 98 and replace my motherboard and vid card.
After everything was back to where it should be, I fired up EQ.  To my
complete astonishment, the game was running like a dog!   PIII 800, GeF2
MX200 32MB, 512MB, 7200 Ultra DMA HD.  Anyway, the game ran fine on my older
GeF 256, so what was up?  All the graphics settings were cranked to the max
like before, but the game was really really laggy and took a stupid amount
of time and effort to even start up.  I actually got to read the cutsie
sayings!!  ANYWAY....found out that my DMA setting on the hard drive was no
longer checked.  Clicked it on, rebooted, fired it back up.....back in
Heaven.

So, just something else that may help someone out there enjoy the game.
