Probably a difference in definitions here; I say reducing the power of 
any given spell, power, or effect is a nerf, but I don't necessarily 
mean its wrong when its done.

Thus to me, monks, mages, and clerics were all nerfed (as examples), 
even though clerics merely had their spell line fixed to work as it says 
it does, mages had their spell line fixed to work... as intended?, and 
monks were assaulted by bears.  Its a nuetral term to me, merely 
describes a reduction in power regardless of "reasoning".
