Yup. Making a determined effort to slip a bad name through can and
will get an account suspended.

Give you 3 guesses why the names were being rejected if they were all
like those 2. If he has an "exaggerated respect for authority", why's
he trying to slip in clear violations? Of course, it probably has
something to do with "daddy" not teaching him the rules... Better yet,
by the sound of it, this is a young child...why is he playing a game
that's rated for teens?

Sounds to me like any respect for authority is exagerrated respect in
your eyes...
