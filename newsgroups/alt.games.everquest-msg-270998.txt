You maintain that position because you never had to live through it.

Wizards who grew up with an unlimited mana pool nuking everything in sight,
only to get groups wiped over and over again because the only tactic they
knew was "nuke early and often", thereby dragging an angry mob to the back
of the party where it proceeded to lay waste to the casters.

Clerics who abandon groups in Paw because their KEI had run out and they'd
never learned to manage their mana without one.

Shaman who never learned to Canni and how far down to safely take it becasue
they'd never had to.

Lvl 53 - 59 chanters who find themsleves unable to get groups because they
don't have the ability to cast KEI.

Yes, it matters that much.  It matters to the people who you'll one day be
grouping with.

And ultimately it matters to you, because once identified as someone who
knows so little about how to play their class you'll find that the group
invitations will dry up.  People have long memories and longer /ignore
lists.
