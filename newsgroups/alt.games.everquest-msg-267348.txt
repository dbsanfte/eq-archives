Except that someone just commented that one of the major newsreaders 
filters out anything before a colon, so that all posts reading

EQ2: Threadname

will have replies reading

Threadname

Which will then cause all sorts of hassle for other people who have used 
their ignore on the original thread.

So what we need is a different marker than the EQ2: people have 
proposed.  I'd suggest (EQ2), as I used to be in a group that used that 
type marker and nobody ever brought up this complaint.
