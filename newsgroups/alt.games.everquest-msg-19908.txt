Well so far 3 out of 5 replies (60%) are for Lake of Ill Omen (as well as
suggestions I've gotten in-game)...
so maybe I should take a clue and make a Kunark run.  Right now I am camped
at Lesser Faydark so it shouldn't be too bad.

Any suggestions on how to navigate to LOIO safely and what to avoid? Plus if
anyone on Veeshan is interested in grouping
let me know.  I appreciate all the responses.  Not only is EQ a great game
but all of the resources on the Net
(including this Newsgroup) really add to the experience.

My only problem now is in balancing RL responsibilities (got Engaged,
moving, transferring positions at work, etc),
with my desire to play as often as I can.... lol.  Oh well, I guess that is
the grief we have to bear...  : )
