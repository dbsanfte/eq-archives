About average to above average for my previous guild.  I have one Skyshrine 
piece, and 3 or 4 Thurgadin pieces, rest is a mishmash of stuff I made, had 
made, looted, or was passed on to me.  No vindi gear yet, unless some of it 
is droppable, and someone bought some.  I fall short of that on HP unless I 
have full level 65 buffs.  I had 5 more AA when I passed the trial.
