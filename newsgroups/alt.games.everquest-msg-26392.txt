I just went through this myself, posted here witht he same question not long
ago hehe, most of the group suggested a ge force card but my being on a low
budget (my god if you don't have kids wait til ly ou win a lottery) so I
went for a kind of rip-off geforce card and got the 3d prophet 32ram version
which uses the geforce 2 chip (i went for pci because I'm cheap dammit!)
it's an excellent card and is working wonders with eq for me, so I'm going
to suggest if you can afford it to get a geforce or a card using it's chip
like the 3d prophet =)
