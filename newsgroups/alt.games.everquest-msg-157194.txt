With my first character some nice PC came by and gave me and my friends 30p
to buy equipment with... at the time that was the most money any of us had
ever seen!  We considered saving it to buy a "Great Vekium Staff" for 66p
from a vendor, but thought we'd never see that much money for a long time
and split the coin three-ways.
