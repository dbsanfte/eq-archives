Others have answered your question very well.  Keep in mind that the number
displayed may not be EXACTLY 512...don't worry about it if it isn't, as long
as it's somewhere in the ballpark. :)

Also, if you have 3 memory slots it couldn't hurt to stick one of the 128s
back in.  If your computer fails to boot just take it back out...you're not
going to break anything.  Your motherboard may simply not support it (though
it should).  In EQ you may also notice a much better benefit over just 512.
