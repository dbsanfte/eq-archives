*groan* I picked the tiger.  What an idiot.  I 
*pondered* playing evil, but it seemed like it'd be more 
of a challenge to be good.  However, if and when I get 
it back, I'm going the evil road.  Screw these stupid 
little people, I get more belief out of tossing one of 
the little kids across town than I do tripling the size 
of the city and building them a boat and ... you get my 
point.

And yes, it's slow, boring, dull, gyah.  So here's 
hoping evil at least keeps you entertained.
