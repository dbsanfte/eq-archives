>So, basically my question is - what do I gain by getting the expansions?

Ruins of Kunark will give you the ability to lvl past 50 to 60. It adds a new
race -Iksar. It also adds some 30 new zones right across the level board
(1-60).

Velious add a further 20 zones but mostly for lvl30+ If your just starting out
its probably not that important yet but its definately nice to have when you
get that high.

Luclin is the most recent, it also the most hardware intensive, try to make
sure you match the basic system requirements or you'll be playing with most of
the new features turned off. 
The expansion adds a new race - Beastlord, new cities and zones, approx 30 new
zones for every lvl (1-60), a new transport system that makes travels slightly
easier (if your willing to wait)


What you have to ask yourself is do you enjoy eq: if the answer is yes then you
really can't go wrong by buying the expansion sets and getting them all
together as they are going to give you a huge new world to explore and lots
more hours of fun.

I don't care what is written about me so long as it isn't true.
