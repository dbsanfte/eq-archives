Possible.  But it could also be that the druid is that player's 12th 
character.  He may already know how to play so well that he can defeaat 
the yellow /con with only moderate difficulty.  Or he may be wearing 
impressive armor or buffs handed down by his main, making it trivial.  
Or he may be working on defense skillups in a rather tedious way. :)

It being a druid, most likely he just got the level 1 spell flame lick, 
tried to cast it, and discovered he needed a fire beetle eye in order to 
cast it...
