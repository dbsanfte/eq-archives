Quite often you have to get beyond 2 or 3 paragraphs to get a quest. Just
try the same tactics for the second paragraph and hopefully it will lead to
the quest ( or to a further paragraph that will at least )

Usually it's just a case of saying something like ( as an earlier poster
said ) "what about [words]"

Important seems to be to include all of the key words in a sentence but it
can be a bit touch and go

"yes I will do a small service for you" ( small service - from memory )
"yes I will deliver the mail to Qeynos" ( deliver, mail, qeynos )
"What about the Sabertooths?" ( Sabertooths )

I've had pretty good luck with "yes I will" or "I will" but there may be
easier ways to do it - I haven't been playing long.

Those NPCs do seem to be a little picky at times :)

Hope this helps!
