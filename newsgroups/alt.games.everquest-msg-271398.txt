CoH's sidekick system is an attempt to address what I call the varible-
advancement-rates problem of MMORPG design.

The problem is that different people will progress in the game at
different rates, depending on their skill, free time, vacations, etc. 
The tendency, therefore, is for friends to find themselves unable to
group together because their characters' levels are too far apart.

In CoH, any character of level 10 or higher may temporarily appoint
another lower-level character as a sidekick.  So long as the sidekick
remains reasonably close to his mentor, he is effectively one level
lower than the mentor--his hitpoints, chance to hit, and so forth are
boosted.  The sidekick receives experience proportional to his actual
level for fighting mobs at his effective level.  For example, the level
10 sidekick of an level 50 character will gain experience for killing a
level 49 mob as if he had killed a level 10 one.

Sidekicking is temporary; you do it for a play session, not on a
permanent basis.

The upshot is that if you're level 30, you can sidekick your level 20
friend and play with him.  You can also reverse-sidekick, dropping your
effective level to 20.

It's a decent system.  Not perfect by a long shot, but a fair sight
better than what anyone else has to offer.  I give the CoH devs major
kudos just for trying to address the problem.
