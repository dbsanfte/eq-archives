Polished Steel Ulak 9/27 Magic (can hit wisps/ghouls etc) with some
stats.

PSUs are a dime a dozen. You should be able to find them in the bazaar
for less than 20pp. They will serve you well into your 40s.

When you have enough money pick up a fast piercer and 1h-blunt weapon.
Put it in your offhand and let the skills raise as you fight. It will
take a long time, but you will max them eventually.

At level 22 you can farm Willowisps for Lightstones and Greater LS.
Then do the turn-in quest at the Gypsy camps in Oasis or North Karana.
(Unless you are on the FV server, where wisps turn TLC at @16level)
