I was the one who wrote that, so I'll answer you. I do NOT know for
sure that ShowEQ is how they know. I have stated that fact previously
in this thread which apparently you haven't bothered to read in it's
entireity. I *do* know that they are obtaining information of this
type SOMEHOW, and it seems likely to me that it is related to packet
sniffing of some sort. Perhaps there is something that spawns
immediately before rage does; perhaps there is an invisible spawn that
triggers it. I wouldn't know, seeing as how *I* don't use ShowEQ or
other similar programs. That, or they have a GM in their pocket
popping it for them, which I think is unlikely.  I'm sorry; but do you
really think it's a *coincidence* they showed up 2-3 min. before rage
popped, 4 spawns in a row. If you do, you're an idiot, in addition to
being a cheater.

ShowEQ is a cheat. PERIOD. Whether it is how the guild in question
knows rage is about to pop or not, it gives you an unfair advantage in
a number of situations over players who do not use it. I sincerely
hope you get caught and banned for being a stupid, snivling little
sneak who isn't bright enough to play EQ without assistance from
packet sniffers. FOAD. Plain and simple.
