Same here... Well, I've been to Droga and Nurga, as well as Air, Fear and 
Hate, but I haven't been to Umbral Plains yet, or most of the Evil cities 
(I'm only counting zones visited by Hanrahan, not by any other of my 
characters).

Hehe... the only key I have is for the second floor of Befallen.

Ben, I have a special question for you... How are you finding 52? Please 
tell me that it's going faster than 51, because I'm going slowly insane. 
I just yesterday dinged my first yellow bubble in it. Aaaargh!
