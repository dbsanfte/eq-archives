Whole bunch of people, used to be mainly UK people or
UK speaking europeans, but since the movelog (6 months
ago or thereabouts) it's about 50-50 with people from the
US servers too. I'd say the majority of players, at a guess,
are upwards of level 40, with the big movelog guilds like
Mortalis chewing up the high end content... although I hear
the competition is friendly and its still not crowded in the
sense that a lot of servers are. There aren't nearly as many
"true newbies" on there as you may think.

Atmosphere on there is generally friendly, and community-
spirited.

Low-end zones (with the exception of the hot-spots) are
pretty empty most of the time, and there are some surprisingly
low-population zones like KC which is often nearly empty.
The majority of low-level characters appear to be people's
alts. You can get a group almost anywhere, in my experience,
although as I said it's not overcrowded.

The economy is strange too... seems like a lot of stuff is
cheaper than on other servers. If you do a kit+coin transfer,
don't buy things on your old server with an expectation of
selling them on at a profit on VS.

There's an unofficial forum at www.venrilsathir.com, which
has an outlet for people looking to do mid-level / epic
encounters, and open raids.

All this just as I see it... anyway, HTH.
