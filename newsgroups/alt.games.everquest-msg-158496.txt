except in the actual POP's, the /raid function is virtually useless.
instead of doing a code around so those with the planes could use the /raid
function with those without it and just those with POP with /raid ability
would get exp, they made it so that people without POP just plain cannot use
/raid at all, making it next to impossible to allow the /raid ability much
practical functionality in about 90 % of the content of EQ.

Let me say that having a glimpse that I could be earning exp on raids and
suddenly not being able to enjoy it, not because I don't have the ability to
enjoy it, but others don't, puts a sour taste in my mouth.  And what is more
frustrating is that if even one person in your group doesn't have PoP, then
your out of the /raid equation and none of your group earns exp with the
RAID.  conceivably in a 24 person raid you could have 4 people without the
expansion, one in each group, stopping the entire raid from using POP.  and
often will be the case that just grouping these 4 together won't be an
option, because they hold key positions like being a cleric, etc.
Furthermore, its just going to be an extra headache for anyone to even
attempt to work around this to allow people with POP to use /raid, and
almost 95 % of the time outside the plains raids won't use them because its
too much trouble.

I was actually in two raids, and I couldn't get beyond the fact that this
/raid just wasn't being used in the first one.  I ran the 2nd one, and tried
to use it.  It actually stopped me from grouping people in my group because
they didn't have POP ( I'm guessing this is the reason ).  Instead of being
easy to use, this stupid /raid function slowed down the entire raid until
someone else figured out this was why we couldn't group.

basically not allowing people with PoP to join in /raids by making them
incompatible with people without it, lines it up with a marketing scheme.
One of the reasons I bought it was for being able to join raids and get exp.
suddenly I'm finding I was bamboozled.

If they let those without PoP join the /raid, just note they don't have PoP
and not give them exp would fix the problem by allowing people to be
compatible in groups again.

Chances are this is going to be a long lasting problem in raids outside PoP,
considering the fact that appearantly 20 % of EQ population doesn't have
previous expansions, and PoP isn't going to be an exception.
