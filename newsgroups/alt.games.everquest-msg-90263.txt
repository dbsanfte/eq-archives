Try hitting "Ctrl-Esc" the next time your EQ hangs.  It works for
me.

That is, it minimizes the EQ game and gives you control of your
computer again so you can nuke the frozen task -- it won't let
you switch back into the game even if EQ wasn't hung when you do it.

But it's better than rebooting.
