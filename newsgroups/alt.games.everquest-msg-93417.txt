My advice is don't split the exp. Go 100% to leveling or 100% to AA.
All splitting does is make it take longer to get the reward of the level
or any AA skill you want.

Since you are a Cleric I would suggest you level up to 52 since you are
so close. Then switch 100% to AA and do run speed to 3 and then
switch back to 100% leveling. Just my opinion.

Run speed is awesome. Works indoors, can't be dispelled, cuts
travel time if you can't get a sow or sow runs out.
