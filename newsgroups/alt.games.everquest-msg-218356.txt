It doesnt make any difference which is slowed first, either way there will
be an unslowed mob bashing the tank, using assist will get the mob targetted
and slowed faster.

Of course this is situational, but you can have the MA's mob targetted
before it is even in camp, and slowed before it has been engaged by the
whole party.

I will generally go for a slow with no malo in case of inc add's, a gamble
but it often works.

You can then target the next 100% mob, pull it out with slow then root.

Doesnt make any difference.

Yes, this is what I generally do, most of the time it is only one or two
adds, if I left the original unslowed the tank will be taking more damage
than if I slowed it first.  Slow target, pull off adds with slow.  As
opposed to pull off add with slow, park, pull off other add with slow, park,
slow original mob.

Dont know where you are fighting but in planes this = dead shaman.

Sure shaman should have lots of HP, but that means squat when mobs double
for 800 etc.

I guess you are thinking ldon where the mobs generally hit like girl scouts,
I guess it could be possible, but, I prefer not to be lazy and use manual
targetting and safely pull the adds away, rather than risk my own, and in
turn, my parties lives, with crazy add pulling antics.  But then I have a
nice machine and am a fast targetter (due to playin CS for waaay to long
:P ).

Most of the stuff here is situational, like alot of EQ, depending on space,
party make up, whether you have a good pal / sk tanking etc, they are the
general tactics I will use but they can change on the fly if needed or if
they dont seem to be working.

No one has ever complained about my slowing style, but maybe they just didnt
want to piss the shaman off :P
