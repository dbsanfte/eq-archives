Not pointless.  If fifteen minutes is within the parameters of
normal play then thirty minutes is hardly the exageration you're
making it out to be.

You're missing my point, I think.  The flaw I refer to is that the
game's built-in rewards (levels and loot) go preferentially to those
who engage in the most mindless (or least creative, if you prefer)
behavior (grinding and pharming).  Because of this most players seem
to spend most of their time doing one of those two (and with such
interesting and stimulating game play is it any wonder that public
channels in popular zones are full of idiocy?).
