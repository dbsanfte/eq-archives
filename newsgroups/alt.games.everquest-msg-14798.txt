I think King Xorbb is sometimes confused with Lord Soptyvr (which spawns
in the middle of the evil eye area in the Gorge) or Borxx (which spawns
in Runnyeye).  

I have hunted for months in the Gorge and never heard of King Xorbb
spawning there, only Lord Soptyvr.  But King Xorbb is discussed in some
of the web sites (see
http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=3520 ) so it's
possible he exists at least on some servers, or did at one time.
