If there si one bright side, the more people that knows about hi ninja
looting, the less likely he'd be able to get grouped in the future and
less likely to be accepted in a guild. Since nearly all fabled items
are no drop, the only way to lose the bad rep is to pay through the
nose for server transfer.

Do be sure to file petition.  While the GM probably can't do much,
recieving an excessive number of complaints against one person should
get the attention and possibly lead to suspension.
