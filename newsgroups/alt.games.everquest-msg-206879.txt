While hunting in Stonebrunt the other day I found a cave on the west
zone/cliff wall. The cave entrance is lit but appears to be blocked by large
boulders, these actually turn like doors when clicked and you can pass
beyond them into a longer cave passage. The second passage is a dead end but
I imagine this is to be the entrance to a new zone.
Anyone know how long this has been there? Is it a new addition to the zone
for LDoN or has it been there forever for some future (free) zone?
