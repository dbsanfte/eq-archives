You mean LCD don't you?  I would definitely try before buying.  I have a
Dell 17" which is a pretty nice model (probably near $600 MSP) and it's
sharp, vibrant, and I love it for games.  A lot of times, first person games
will blur when you move around but this one is fine.   Then again, I've
played EQ on a laptop LCD and it would blur so bad while moving/turning that
you could only see when you were stopped.
