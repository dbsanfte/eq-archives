Quickness is kind of a waste when soloing. Priest melee sucks 
ass, so the haste will make you suck faster. So that would also
eliminate the need for the slow (you won't be meleeing)

There you go.

So that leaves room for a nuke as well as maybe more dots.

Essentially you don't need the quickness and slow unless grouped, in
which case you'd not really need dots, or with your 34 pet.
