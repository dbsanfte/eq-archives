Hmm. I agree in that I rarely have time to group, or when I am asked
to group I'm so tired that I feel I can barely take care of my own
character, not additinal characters. I wouldn't want my tiredness to
mess up the group's attempt at something.

I've gotten one character up to War9 and another one to War8 without
grouping. My other two are War5. None of them have much in the way
of gear. One of the War5 has mostly cloth items. I try to only go
after monsters that /con blue or light blue. I've attempted white
/con if I can get away by zoning or running towards guards. I've
been hit by a /con yellow lioness once.. had my character run as it
was joined by a /con yellow lion. Just made it with about 5 percent
hp left.
