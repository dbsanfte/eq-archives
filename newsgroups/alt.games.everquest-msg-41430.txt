hehe, exactly what I've been saying to people

Go look at the literal translations from the original quatrains and
you'll find nothing even vaguely hinting at the recent tragedies to
befall the US. According to Ol' Nostro, WWIII will be fought almost
entirely on Euro soil, centred around the Mediterranean, with Gibraltar
being a flash point. It will supposedly be a biological war, escalating
to nukes.

Some newspaper probably made up the 'prophecy' and people have been
circulating it like sheep ever since
