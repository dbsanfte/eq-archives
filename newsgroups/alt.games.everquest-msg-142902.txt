That's where the guild makes a difference.  When not raiding, you
should have a group of folks that you can immediately xp with in a
little used zone.  I'm not saying that your guild sucks or something
dumb like that, what I'm saying is that you need to find folks that
play when/how you do, and make sure you all stay together.  Pulling
the trash in Kael's arena or smacking vampyres in ME can be fun
if you're not worried about if your groupmates are idiots or not.  xp is
good and you have fun.

This, again, sounds like a guild problem.  Raids should be scheduled
in advance (unless it's random..."Hey, Statue is up"), and it should never
take more than 20 minutes to assemble a raid force (5-10 minutes if
the raid is scheduled).  Groups that pretty much know their assignments.
Monks already pulling the trash for the KS group to clear ;-).  Different
zones have different rules and mobs to clear, and some boss mobs
can take 30 minutes to kill.  However having a strong leader and a group
of folks that REALLY know what they're doing can mean that even a 20
minute fight has its high points.  Wipeouts happen, but there should also
be plans made to take that into account.  If you ever go even to Fear
without
a wipeout plan (and it can definately happen even to a server's uberguild),
recovery can be horrible.  With a good plan and some veterans of tough
CR/rezing around, that same wipeout may mean a 15 minute break.

 If loot distribution isn't already decided before the raid starts, then
you're raiding with the wrong folks.  This is not an insult.  Whether
by a point system or officer decision, loot should NOT be a discussion
during a raid.  Bad/poorly thought out loot rules ARE the death of many
otherwise happy guilds.  I've raided and raided and raided with no
loot, and also gotten several drops off of a boss mob all to myself
when it was my turn.  If your guild is dedicated to raiding and improving
the GUILD as a whole, then loot isn't a problem because you know
that the FT IV cape will be yours the next or the next next time ;-).

Again, that sounds like a guild problem.  My main's guild is made
up 94% of folks that work in the same place.  We rarely even say
much on screen, as folks are usually comunicating verbally.  3 folks
who aren't employees with us don't even speak english, and are
spoken to in Japanese on screen (not by me...we have 4-5 folks that
are fluent in Japanese that can translate for them/us).  If your guild
is populated by teens that you can't stand, leave.  It's the wrong guild
for you anyways.  My alt's guild combined with another guild not too
long ago, and it was sort of hard getting used to the new names.
However making allowances for folks that are different from you can
really make a huge difference, and getting a stick out of your own
ass (not _you_ personally, a general "you") can really help you settle
down and have fun.

After all, it IS a game...
