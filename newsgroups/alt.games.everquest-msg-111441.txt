Yeah actually . Since you would now have 21 chances to roll on the item
versus newbie dweebs one. Not why I prefer this method though. I prefer
random because it takes less time (which is really odd). It dosent require
memorizing what you gave player 1-120 in the last 3 monthes. It keeps people
always wanting to raid , if you know you cant get anything for some reason
incentive goes way down. It seriously reduces friction between guildmembers
and seriously reduces the hassle to officers.

People are always going to complain about loot. Even when it is so
plentifull that my level 4 paladin bankcharacter is in full deepwater or
heavy worked dragonhorn since there is nobody else who even wanted it. One
of our officers advocates just destroying all the loot occasionally since he
gets so exasperated:)
