Then you, too, misunderstood the reason for my post/question.
I'm sorry both you and Kaev misunderstood, but it doesn't
change the fact that, well, you and Kaev misunderstood.

Perhaps you and Kaev should stop jumping to conclusions, or
at least find something better to do than hassle people on

Except that I didn't complain.  I went out of my way to
point out that *I* have a 24/7 broadband connection, so the
way the bazaar is implemented doesn't negatively affect me
