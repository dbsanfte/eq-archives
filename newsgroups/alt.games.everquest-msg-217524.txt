Do you see where Tim's "anyone else notice a problem with this?", and
my comment came from now?  I can't see any other way to read that than
that "the Erudites" switched back because of "constant forehead cracks",
which would, as you note, be rather pointless.

And now the "joke" has been beaten to death, may it rest in peace.
