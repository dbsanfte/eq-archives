Thank you for your oh so wonderful and insightful reply.  Perhaps in Britain
it is common for someone's MOM to have a wife, but here in the states, a Mom
(such as myself if you bother to look at the return addy) tend to have male
partners with which to raise their children.

It was a simple question, no need to be a jackass.
