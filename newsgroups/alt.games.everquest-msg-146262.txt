Well, there's a difference between telling a joke and reading a joke on USENET.
If somebody looks into your face while he spreads his wisdom, you can usually
tell, whether he actually believes in it, or not. That's the reason why it is
generally not a good idea to be ironic on USENET. Emoticon, or not. This 
ain't no PC bullshit like not to say this or that. You have to tread carefully.
And never write something you don't believe in, without explicitly marking it
as irony.
But since the original poster x-postet it simply everywhere, it's a save bet
that he is a simple minded moron.
BTW I like jewish jokes. Jokes BY jews, NOT jokes about jews. They tend to be
witty(and a little bit neurotic).
Human interaction is about respect. You may be vocal, but mind the thin
invisible line. I live in a country where you are reminded every day that 
respect for any human being is a valuable good.
