It can most defenitely be done. But, it takes some skill, some nerve and
more time.

I prefere to solo. I've solo'd most of my 30 levels. Up untill lvl 30 you
can rather easily take down all mobs of your level with melee. At 22 you get
the aforementioned panic animal, which only works on animals, but is very
handy at LOIO. The trick is snare and fear, makes em run away slowly. Hack
hack hack and bobs your uncle really.
But it only works on animals, that limits your options a bit.
At 30 you get sow. At this point you can  pretty much run away from all
fights that go wrong, provided you run away at the right time. So if you
take on something that proves to be a little tough, just leg it to the
neares zone.

As a ranger, bow kiting is an option, though at 30 I've fired about 100
arrows in total, my skill stinks. But for role playing purposes and because
I am a ranger and should be bloody brilliant at it, I'm now going to spend
all my time skilling up. Forget the exp grind for awhile.

Did I stay near the topic? I tend to meander off.
