How do they make the decision if it is soloable or not?  I am currently 
soloing quests that involve killing group mobs, the quests in question 
are writ quests that are given for my level of 20-24.  So, should those 
be marked group quests, or solo quests?  I should add, none of the 
encounters in question are grey, the group ones are green single and 
double up arrow.
