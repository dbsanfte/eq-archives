Irrelevant. I'd benefit more if they released a free expansion instead 
of fixxing video card problems that don't affect my video card and bugs 
in areas I don't care to frequent, or class issues of classes I'm not 
playing.

A problem is a problem and it should be monitorered, assessed a priority 
(even if its a low one) and eventually fixed. You don't have to abort 
everything else to do it right now, but you shouldn't pretend it isn't 
there either.

Is it way too minor because it hasn't happened to you?? Or because it 
doesn't happen to anyone? And do the devs know its minor? How can they 
know? CS doesn't report incidents; they deny they even occur, deny they 
even can occur. If the problem became huge how would they even know?

I'm not saying its a rampant problem that must be stopped NOW, and that 
all development of new content should take 2nd to this. I **merely** 
said the problem shouldn't be dismissed out of hand as something a few 
irate players imagined up, without investigation, without logging it.

Or do you beleive that the devs should take all their design cues from 
the whining and bitching on the 'forums'?

Listening to the sqeakiest wheels is a terrible way to run a project.
