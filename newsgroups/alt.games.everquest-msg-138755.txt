would take about 4 or 5 fields in a single table in a database and some
pretty basic {php|asp|perl|your favorite programming language for web
apps} along with a very basic understanding of sql to set it up.  should
only take someone with a bit of a clue about half an hour to set it up.
the hard part would be getting people to populate the database with
useful information.

maybe i'll see if my girlfriend will let me use everaddicts.com for it
:P

also, it seems this would be _really_ simple for a site like allakhazam
or caster's realm to pick up...  they've certainly already got the
hosting sorted out and a good sized user base ;)
