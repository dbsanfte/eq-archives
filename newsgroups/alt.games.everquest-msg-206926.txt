just for the hell of it, i started a ranger....and i want some info, pweeze

1)BOW --  i want a nice twink bow.....any help? i can't search effectively
because the recommended level 50+ crap gets in the way...i need something my
level 2 toon can use...shissar bow is what i have now, it's 20/35 range150 .
.. i'd either basically want something faster, or just a general all-around
bow with stats and such, provided the level doesn't get in the way . . .
.oh, and blessed faydark thunderbolt seems okay, stats and ratio and all
that, but i'm not planning on rushing though 1-20........

2)QUIVER -- what's the deal? sorry, 3 years and all i've gleamed is that
some quivers make the reload (and thus overall attack) faster...but how do i
know what's what? i remember the fleeting quiver recipe being fixed like 2
years ago, but i still don't know why / if it's good, what the alternatives
are, and if it's tailors or fletchers that i should bother, or if there are
quests...clueless, yes i amb

3)ATK --a)  is there any way to tell what my atk in archery is? atk only
applies to the weapon in primary slot, yeah? so phooey to archery? help?
must i just remember the skill in relation to the cap for the level? .....

b)haste -- haste spells DO affect my archery rate, yes? i've hasted many a
ranger, but they dont ask for pure haste (wr 70%), they ask for haste with
stat buffs (vog, then sov)....if they're anal and want str or dex, fine, but
agi? wtf does agi have to do with archery? wives' tale? for the
just-in-case-aggro ? is it a coincidence that agi comes with the other stat
buffs? ....also, haste + buff spells [that aren't augment/augmentation] will
give +ATK . . .soooo does ATK improve archery, even though the primary slot
is measured as ATK? *help*

c) da -- do rangers get double attack with archery?  i can't remember if i
ever got a double hit while playing my war, but i don't know if that even
has anything to do with rangers (the elevation double attack bug that mages
got...could that bug have worked for melees?)

d) crit -- rangers ONLY get crits in archery? ok...is there any calculation
for this? i just want to know that rangers are better than warriors, but
without  the aa . . .a 40 ranger beats a 40 warrior, even though they both
get crits (and can double attack, i assume....if one can, the other can
too?) right?

e) root/snare -- i never paid attention (since i only kite as crowd control
=p) to the whole damage vs rooted/snared issue.....and i don't want essays,
either...so, for maximum damage, is it better to have a mob rooted, snared
and running, not snared but running, feared, or does it not matter now? or
it didn't matter but now it does? also, since i'll probably root and shoot a
mob if i'm low on HP (which happens a lot, kind of like the whole world
wants to kill me, which is true since i'm a ranger), what is the "discount"
on damage? will a maximum hit potential be reduced by half, or only 10%, or
something? is there any way to tell?

4) TANK? -- i honestly want to run around with a bow and plink stuff to
death, but assuming i end up leveling, when is it no longer viable to tank?
i know there is a relative curve kind of thing (hard to explain, you know
what i mean) where a ranger can tank (probably solo) mobs of the low-blue
(but not lightblue) con, but that breaks down after mid levels...in general
experience, leaving archery kiting aside, when do rangers lose the ability
to stand their ground? for rogues i know it's pretty early, are rangers
about the same ? (barring AA ) i'm just curious

rogues don't get an ac penalty though, right?

5) and this is out of left field, but is there any way to link tracking w/
the LOY window? i know one is static and the other is dynamic, but . . .is
there?

.....

thanks in advance
