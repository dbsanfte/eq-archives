Not for that long, and a painful percentage of people don't bother reading
or attempting to digest what the patch messages say.

I actually had a guildmate that I thought was FAIRLY in touch with stuff ask
in guildchat why <insert inventory item> is glowing when he's casting a
spell.

*sigh*

But on the subject of mages, many people have high level characters and
there are very few mages out there...it's conceivable that even if you were
a caster (focus doesn't directly affect pure melee classes) you wouldn't
know much (if anything) about them.  *I* still have to look up with summoned
item does exactly what, since the names when you inspect them often have
silly-assed names that make no sense to me.

It's pretty frightening that we only had 3 or 4 focus item TYPES
before...now we have more like a dozen (seems that way, anyway).  Trying to
keep up with what does what is going to be very tough for me.
