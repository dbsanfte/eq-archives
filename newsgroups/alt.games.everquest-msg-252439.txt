Ah. So you admit that it matters whether the shirt is returned or not?  
Well then.  by analogy, it matters who ended up 'owning' the virtual 
property involved, and your statement that he 'stole' the money based 
solely on the fact that he 'actually took it back' does not hold water.  
And therefore, it is not stealing until the ownership issue is cleared up, 
ie, he is convicted.

}Let me fix your analogy.

}Yes, it follows that you stole the money.

The analogy was not broken.  You said "nobody has in any way stated that 
they didn't think he actually took the money back.  Thus, he stole the 
money."  Hopefully it is clear that, based solely on whether I receive 
money back for the shirt or not, it may or may not be stealing, depending 
on the disposition and condition of the shirt in question.

To further this analogy, the store in question will probably seek a credit 
from the supplier they got the shirt from.  My experiences in retail 
suggest that in many cases, the supplier will not even request that the 
shirt be returned, and will give the credit regardless.  Is the shop then 
stealing when they get -that- money back, despite the fact they threw the 
shirt in the dumpster out back like they said they would?  Do they 
suddenly become thieves when a homeless person breaks into the dumpster 
and decides to wear the shirt despite its obvious and glaring flaw?

Even with non-virtual property it's a complicated enough issue that the 
mere existence of a refund is not sufficient grounds, alone, to declare 
that theft has occurred.

You will note, also, that he didn't take the money out of the register 
while nobody was looking.  Paypal was looking, and tacitly agreed with 
him.  The shopkeeper gave paypal arbitration in these circumstances by 
agreeing to use their service.

Whether the buyer's decision to demand a refund, Paypal's decision to 
endorse and enable it, and the merchant's decision to sell property of 
questionable ownership were valid can only, at this point, be decided in a 
court, and one that will have the task of setting a precedent.

}Thanks for playing.

You're welcome.  Do play again. :)
