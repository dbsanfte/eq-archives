Me bard is only dubious to Vekis for some odd reason (maybe his
being agnostic is the reason for this?).  Seeing that I went to use
my faction song to see if he would talk to me and thus learn his
purpose in life (Luky is a curious sort).  As fate would have it I
had earlier that day gotten a new keyboard with which I had yet to
get on friendly terms.  So instead of the faction song I hit the
charm song (actually both keys were hit but the wrong one got the go
ahead naturally).  Vekis was not amused by my error and his pet was
immediately hostile.   I got Selo's going and me healing song in a
twist to allow me to survive the ruthless DOT he had cast upon me.
I made it to the zone with but a sliver of hit points left and
decided it would be easier to just look this short-tempered Iksar up
on the Internet.
