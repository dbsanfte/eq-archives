Ah, that I didn't know.  In any case, having bumbled round Neriak very
embarrassingly for an hour earlier today, I think it's safe to say I
certainly BEHAVE like a level 1 newbie at the moment...!  Probably as well I
take some time to get used to it again...  :o)

In fact, that did, thanks.  NVidia reference drivers SEEM to have done the
trick.  I've been changing eye and hair colours quite merrily since I
installed them, so I can only assume they've solved the problem.  Now I just
need to take Julie's suggestion of getting more RAM in the hope it'll solve
this REALLY annoying problem of "jump-cutting" that the game seems to do
now...

Still, mustn't whinge too much, 'cos it is looking pretty damn cool these
days, innit?  I LOVE the new character models - people who actually look
like people...?  I'd never have thought it in the Kunark days...!

Yours really pretty blinkin' well impressed with upgraded EQ,

S.
