hi, for some reason people think im a troll warrior and not a human warrior.

i think its rude that people are mean to trolls, trolls are like bad people in
the game and so are ogres (i think) and most people dont roleplay. its kinda
rude, at least to me. i mean i dont get mad and not help iskars.

and also, thanx for the people who were nice and dont role play and answered my
question about the trivial loot code and the orc castle thing. ill have to
visit orc castle sometime (what levels are there? im 40 right now and id rather
go when im safe)
