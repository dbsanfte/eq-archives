Yeah. Gosh darnit, bards can't kite swarms of 20 mobs at a time
anymore. (If I'm understanding the nerf right) About as bad as the
guys over in CoH bitching about blasters' smoke grenades getting
nerfed (An AOE non-aggro debuff power that could easily reduce entire
packs of mobs' accuracy to 5% from the AT that is about akin to EQ's
wizards leaving them capable of meleeing down mobs higher level than
they are... ).
