Actually, just the opposite.  Most of the groups I've seen seem to be
interested in doing nothing but grinding.  They would sit in one spot
and camp for an entire game session, to me that is just not fun.  The
friends I liked to hang out with enjoyed exploring new areas,
completing quests and other non-grind things.  That is what I would
consider fun.  Not wanting to sit somewhere waiting for a boat so I can
sit on a boat waiting to get to somewhere to do something not-boring is
what this is all about.  But, I guess you are just too stupid to 'get
it'.

Seeing something at least once is enjoyable.  Even a run across the
Great Plains of Karada (or what it was called).  Being forced to endure
something like that everytime you want to get to another area isn't
what I would consider fun.  Especially since those zones are completely
empty anymore.
