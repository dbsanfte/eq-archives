The quest is indeed live, and starts in Castleview for goodies.  There are 
actually several sub-quests involved, ranging in level from 26 to 30.  As a 
26 monk, I soloed the whole thing, with the exception of one part involving 
some level 29-31 solo mobs (for which I had to bring along a cleric).
All in all, it took about 2 hours, not counting a programmed hour wait, and 
I netted about 20% exp from it as well... not bad, IMHO.
