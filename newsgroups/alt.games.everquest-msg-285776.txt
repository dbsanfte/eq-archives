First of all, sorry to those who consider this spam...

But maybe some people here might be interessted in the idea of sharing their
knowledge online.

On www.vabok .com its possible to up- and download any kind of self-written
texts for free.
From 600-page fantasy novels to manuals, fan fiction, guides, collections of
recipies or your true story / opinion... whatever you can write down. And it
would be great if some of you would support this site by submitting
something, maybe some Everquest fan fiction.

Best regards,
TF
