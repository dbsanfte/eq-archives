No, it's not even slightly difficult to explain or understand.  Your
assumption, that proc rate is strictly a per swing calculation, is
however unproven as far as I know.  There was an article published
some time ago (a year or so, iirc) in the Developers Corner that
called out some of the things that effect proc rate (and the author
put it that way too, "some", not all).  I cannot recall whether
Haste was listed among them, but 1H vs. 2H was on the list.  I have
noticed, as I mentioned above, that the proc effect of the Instrument
of Nife buff has little or no apparent change in frequency between a
49 delay 2hander and a 26 delay 1hander.  If I get sufficiently bored
I may try to isolate a log with a 30-delay 2hander I used to train
piercing and compare that to the slashers, wouldn't surprise me at
all to see near equal proc frequency for Instrumentof Nife regardless
of weapon delay.  The only non-buff proc I can think of that you
could test on multiple 1h and 2h weapons would be the Lifedraw proc
on the Black Acrylia weapons.

EQ combat resolution is not very transparent, to assume anything about
it that hasn't been demonstrated in logged testing is pure speculation.
