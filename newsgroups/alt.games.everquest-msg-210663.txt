   I dunno where it says that these things won't cost a metric assload
of money, whether or not they are sold in the bazaar.  Perhaps they will
be like charms, which are not very easy to get at all (for lower to mid

    I just wanna know if I'll be able to augment the fishing grub I
carry in my ammo slot.
