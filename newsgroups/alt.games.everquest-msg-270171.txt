The accumulated wisdom of earlier players would still have value. What 
AAs are good, what situationally good spells are, where to hunt in 
general terms, what sort of characteristics to look for on items. (AC/vs 
HP/vs resists...)

etc.

You'd lose the 'step by step guide to the newbie armor from 4 years 
ago' but in my eyes: good riddance.

Agreed. 

Although in EQ1s case, they really -intended- the player base to 
collaborate in a large scale to solve quests. Most aren't reasonably 
solvable by one player, as finding various rare spawn/drops without a 
collaborative effort would be impossible.

I think many people who value Allahkhazam's so highly have merely been 
conditioned by EQ1s horrible quest system. If they had in game quests 
that 'held their hand a bit more' they wouldn't feel the need to look 
everything up on allakhazams. (Because in EQ1 if you want to finish most 
quests you **DO** need to look them up... )
