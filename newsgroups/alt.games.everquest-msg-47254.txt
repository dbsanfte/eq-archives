The lack of light in the Surefall tunnel is indeed just stupid design
on Verant's part.  However, the Blackburrow tunnel (which is what I
assume you are talking about when you say the "one in Halas") is as it
should be.  The Gnolls aren't going to put up lights that they don't
need, when those lights would only help the Humans and Barbarians who
are the Gnolls enemies.
