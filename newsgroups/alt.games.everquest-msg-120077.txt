 Depends on server. When I was levelling up a gimp I could find a group
there about 50% of the time. The healers and casters are tough and some
of the mobs have damage shields which isn't fun for a monk.

 I'd second the recommendation to go for the Brutes in the caves at that
level. They should be blue to 30 or so. Maybe. It's been awhile since
I've been there so I forgot their level.
