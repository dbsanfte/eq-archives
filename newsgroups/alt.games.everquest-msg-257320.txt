Aww, you really should check them out.   They're quite nice.  The
temple of Cazic Thule looks incredible.  All the shots are in the game
engine.

Also, the stealth effects on the Female DE were very cool to see in
action.  (It's about halfway through.)

I haven't been paying much attention to it, but my interest has been
piqued because of a soon-to-occur PC upgrade.  I spent the better part
of a rainy Sunday checking out screenshots and info.  And I'm liking
what I see.

I had originally dismissed it based on the look of some of the models
as kinda 'plastic-ey'.  But comparing them to screenshots of Doom3,
and there is a simialr feel.  It all matters how they look when
they're actually moving in game.   And a comparison to Doom 3 isn't
bad in that regard.

So, now I'm stoked and can't wait to check it out!  Hurry up!
