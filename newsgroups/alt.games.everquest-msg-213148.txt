The XP in Paludal is great, but the loot is BLEAH.  After finally 
hitting 17 and Feign Death, I moved over to Unrest and started gleefully 
hunting in the courtyard.  The XP might not be as insane as XP, but it 
seems pretty damn good nonetheless.  The loot sells for good cash.  And, 
frankly, it's a lot more exciting than PC, what with all the KOS undead 
and the death beetles that will assist EVERYTHING unless they're green.  :)

And with FD, I don't even have to train anybody!  I just flop over when 
it gets life-threatening.  Oh, and running across Dagnar's Cauldron 
gives me lots of chances to get Safe Fall skillups.  ;)
