When you try to mez a mob the resist roll is against magic resistance and
your level mainly but maybe there is a roll against Charisma. The same goes
for Charming mobs. These are the two defining skills of the class, mezzing
and charming and most gear tending to Enchanters has +CHA stats and we have
spells that give us +CHA so it must play a part in some way.

I find that when mezzing mobs that are high level if my Overwhelming splndor
has worn off i have more resists to the mezzes than when I have it buffed.
218cha buffed, 168unbuffed. I can't say I notice any difference if I
increase my Charisma higher. When I use Rapture on really nasty mofo mobs
then the charisma difference between 168 and 218 is more noticeable.
