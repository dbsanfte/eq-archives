My wife and I are looking for good hunting grounds, we could probably
do Natimbi or some of the other GoD zones, however we don't have the
expansion yet.

We were doing GREAT in the hole, until the Dx9 patch nerfed it so we
can't go in without bribing a rouge to play locksmith.

So just curious about places we could hunt together, duoing.
Thanx
