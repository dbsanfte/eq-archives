Dig no more.

Games Domain: In relation to that, if a subscriber doesn't have Scars of
Velious, will the updated user interface be included with Shadows of Luclin?

Brad McQuaid: To an extent yes, because no matter what, all players will
have to update to the new DirectX 8 client, which comes out around the time
Luclin does. To what extent they'll have the updated user interface is as
yet undecided.
