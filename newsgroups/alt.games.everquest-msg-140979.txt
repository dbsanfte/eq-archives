I know I'll get flamed for this but...

I'd be happy to see the same DoT from 2+ players stack on a
mob.  To me it seems only fair -- after all, there is no rule
that says only one tank can be meleeing the mob at once, yet
that is basically the rule that is applied to DoT classes.
I've never fully understood the reasoning why a group can
have 4 tanks all meleeing, but I cannot cast one of my larger
DoT's because it does not stack with a shaman's spell, thus
limiting my contribution to the group.

With the current stacking rules, many DoT dependant
classes have trouble grouping because of conflicts with
other group members.  Because of this, adding a group
member is not always beneficial if their damage output
is 50% because their spells overlap with another class
that's also in the group.

This proposed new change would make it fair for everyone,
since now everyone in the group will be able to contribute 
100% of their abilities to the death of a monster.  I say
"Hurray" for this change!

Mike
