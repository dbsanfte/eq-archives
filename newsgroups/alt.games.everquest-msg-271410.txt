You can only -force- consume in a main slot.  But you'll eat and drink, 
if hungry, from inside containers.

One solution is to click on the food to "pick it up" (put it on cursor), 
then click on the backpack slot in your inventory (swapping the food 
into main inventory and backpack onto your cursor), click the food to 
take a bite, then reverse the procedure, swap backpack back into slot, 
open backpack and drop food back where it belongs.

There's another plan though, its possible to tie use of a slot to a key 
you use frequently, such as your left turn arrow.  By putting food in 
slot 7, drink in slot 8, you can make it so you are constantly trying to 
eat and drink.  You'll only do so when not stuffed to the gills, so your 
rate of consumption won't go thru the roof doing this, but you'll never 
get hungry while playing till you run out of food in that slot 7, which 
means you protect the food in your backpacks.  Two problems forced me to 
eventually abandon this plan, and finally to go to the expense of simply 
buying stacks of stat food: one, this eats two of your valuable 
inventory slots; considering you could have backpacks there, 20 slots 
worth of storage.  Too high a cost.   Two, this doesn't work if you 
stand still for any length of time; say an extended AFK to play chess 
with your kid.  Stop moving and you stop triggering the eating.

In the end, I carried stat food buried deep with cheap food protecting 
it, and only brought the good stuff out when doing something difficult. 
  And then I gave up on protecting it entirely, and bought only the stat 
food, which after all costs a pittance on a high level income, and lasts 
a long time; Groob Liquidized Meat and Qeynos Afternoon Tea or some such 
combination.  Stack of each will last a week or two of heavy play, take 
up very little inventory space, and costs less than one mob drops in POJ 
Death Row.
