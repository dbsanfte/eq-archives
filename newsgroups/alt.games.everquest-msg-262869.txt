The problem is a fundamental one to MMO design. Designers have been
too stupid to view an MMO in anything other than one person takes all
terms. The main crux of the situation is that only one group may
engage.. and when a mob is killed it stays down for a period of time.
This then creates a bottleneck and an ability to freeze out all other
players. The obvious solution is to place the mob on instant respawn..
with a set of timers and conditions determining the next time you can
reagro it.

There are also methods that you could not only strap a guild to an
event.. but be able to save it at your current point of progress and
restart it the next day. And this is in a non-instanced enviornment.
