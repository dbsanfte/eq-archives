I know that necros and druids (and also SKs and rangers) can fear kite
by casting the darkness snare spell and fear or by casting snare and
panic animal.  I also know that if you cast root on a mob it will
still attack you if you are within striking distance of it.  What
happens if you root a mob and then cast fear on it?  Will it still
attack you if you're close to it even while it's feared or will it
just stand there looking very afraid while you get some free swings at
it? (in other words, can you use only a snare type spell for fear
kiting or could you also use root?)

Thanks in advance,
