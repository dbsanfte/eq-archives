I think they are trying TOO hard to make it not like EQ, perhaps at
the expense of fun. Im in beta now, so I cant really say much, but
many of the main points (and im not breaking the NDA by saying this
because you can read this on thier public web page) of EQ they are
avoiding like the plague, such as uber loot on mobs (best stuff player
made) and no CLEARLY defined class roles in the EQ sense.
