From what James is saying, it sounds like they are.  I'm not sure myself
what the actual costs are, as our little group does not have access to the
zones where the items drop, (I don't think) and as with most tradeskill
things, people are gouging so much at the moment that trying to buy the
individual drops for the combine would end up costing about double what you
pay for the completed item.

I'd say you're somewhat unusally equipped. To get up to 41 regen... thats
what, 35 from items?  Almost at your cap, you must have been really
concentrating on upping it.  As a second data point, my warrior currently
has regen from items of  7 points, and flowing thought of 6.  *grin*

You're also comparing characters from two different eras.   If Bergh was
playing today, I'm sure he would have several more FT pieces.

*shrug*  My hit points definitely don't transfer into damage on a 4:1 ratio
either.  Against most targets worth killing, its the other way around.  Mana
is more important than hit points.  You can do much more with it.  And you
can do it even when you're not getting hit.

It's not enough to justify the extra ripsote damage.

Well, I have a ton more sympathy apparently, as a warrior who is constantly
grouped with a druid and enchanter, but almost never has a cleric around.
We often get to choose between hitting a damage shielded mob, and tanking an
unslowed 500+ hitter for a while as it gets multiple dispells before tash
and slow go in.  Understandably we don't choose that route too often.

If you think thats true, you need to get off the beaten path some. Ranger
and SK mobs often have small damage shields.  Necro mobs have a larger one.
Druid and mage mobs not only have a big damage shield up constantly, they
buff every mob that spawns within casting range of them, as well as any mob
who paths nearby with that same damage shield.

(I also find it somewhat amusing that below you're very forgiving of a group
that tries to head out without a slower... but a group try to play without a
cleric? Heresy!)

And considering I'm the main tank, if I'm not in front of the mob, where
should I be?   Sitting in the corner while the rest of the group root rots
it?

Fair enough.  But what you don't realize is that that *is* the situation we
have now... just in favor of two handers.  Theres never a good reason to use
dual wielder over a two hander, except for having not yet picked up an
equivalent level two hander as a drop.  Equivalent two handers are currently
equal or better in damage, and take much less return damage from damage
shields and ripostes.

And talking to me of small stat boosts and tricks you might need to play
with procs to cover an unbalanced group sounds pretty hollow.

The one damage shield one you posted about before is the only DS one I've
ever heard of.   Primals only come from sleepers.   Snare is the only one
where you can get several weapons that do proc it.     Jolt would work like
aggro weapons.  You can't really swap it in and out because you can't rely
on it procing the second you throw it in.  You have to keep using it to
maintian  your aggro position.   Theres only one tash weapon I know of, and
it's an awfuly sucky ratio.  Bad enough that I wouldn't even use it until it
procs.

You'll see less as you start climbing towards 65.   Mob damage keeps going
up, and more and more has been balanced assuming you have 70% + slow
available and castable instantly.   Much at the same time that the
aforementioned riposte damage starts climbing significantly.

Right or wrong, this game is balanced around the idea that you will be in a
well rounded group, and these days that includes a person casting slow.  As
such, giving one handers big penalties because "You don't lose as much
damage if you have to swap out a weapon to proc slow" (assuming you have one
of the very few slow procing weapons in the game to even try this)  seems a
poorly reasoned decision.
