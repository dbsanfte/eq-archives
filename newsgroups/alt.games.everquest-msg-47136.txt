At 35, sitting automatically engages meditate.  In fact, it is impossible to
sit without meditating oce you hit 35.  What you don't need to do is
look at the book.  You have the -option- of looking at your book in
order to swap spells in and out, and will still be sitting and medding while
you do so.

It is true that while you are not meditating your skill will not increase.  This
isn't a problem post 35, but if you wanted to see what was happening
pre 35, and elected to sit (so as to get hp back more rapidly) without looking
at the book (thus sacrificing the quicker mana regeneration) you would
not improve your skill.  Meditate skill tends to go up very quickly, though,
I generally am capped for level within half an hour of hearing the ding.
