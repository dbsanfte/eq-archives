Um, no, all centaurs are nonaggro unless you have killed one.  I used to 
run around harvesting all over TS before I became KOS to them.  It was 
great, and allowed me to do harvesting at a fairly low level.  I joined a 
group to kill Bloodtalon, not thinking to ask about their centaur status, 
and, they killed 2 or 3 of them, and I've been KOS to them since.
