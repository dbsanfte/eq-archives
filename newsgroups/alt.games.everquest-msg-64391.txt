Well, for starters, the patcher is gone by the time you get to the server 
select screen :)

I have heard that the new patcher tunnels these files across HTTP, which 
was definately NOT what that protocol was designed for. This means 
increased packet size, IE increased download time, IE more bandwidth 
consumed at the source. IF it does run on HTTP, the REALLY smart thing to 
do would have been to purchase a two week chunk of Cidera and Akamai's 
offering... These guys do web caching software and hardware which they give 
to ISPs so that guys like CNN and Yahoo do not have to push the same page 6 
million times. These files could have been transparently cached and 
downloaded from your ISP had Sony Online chosen to do this.
