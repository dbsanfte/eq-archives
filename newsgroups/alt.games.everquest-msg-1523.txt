Not only that, but the "going personally to get it" (with or without
help) is one of the best things in Everquest.  Whacking mobs over and
over again for exp or money gets pretty tedious after a while, but
venturing deep into the darkest corners of {zonename} to track down
the wily {mobname}, knock it down, and wrest the prized {questitem}
from its clutches is a new and unique adventure every time.

My Armor of Ro quests were a major pain in the butt, but since I
went and did it all myself (with the help of good friends of my
same level), I saw things, went places, and had adventures that
I *never* would have seen/gone/had otherwise.  And as much work
as it was, I had a blast.

Whenever someone wants me to go fetch an item for them, or 
hand them something while standing there in the bank, I always
get the urge to say, "look, are you here to actually have FUN,
or just get handouts?"

It's an old cliche, but in Everquest, as in Real Life, the
road itself is the true thing of value, not the destination.
