Definitely!

Healers are a premium there, at those levels. I don't know why. 
I currently have a Necro there, and have been called to do downtime
healing due to a lack of healers! Everyone donated for a KEI for me, so
I could keep my D0Ts going without having to rely on cannibalizations.
They are that hard up.

As for 31, get thee to Hollowshade Moor. Hunt the Grimlings that roam
for really good exp. If the Owlbears are up, BONUS! About every 10 kills
I get a Pristine Owlbear Pelt. These sell in the Bazaar for 800pp. Great
loot and great experience.

Don't try to outrun a Grimling. Even with a level 60 SoW, they stayed on
my tail even when I hit 'em with Darkness. 
Fear, however, gets them far far away.... ;-)
