Nobody's trying to elect a shaman to be the primary tank. The argument 
was that in solo situations they can tank their kills, and in group 
situations they can stand there and take their licks without having to 
run like a girlscout with a little stream leaking out of their leggings

I think Alasdair argued it sometime before Kunark, when Rage was not 
nerfed, and when 50 was a maximum level. To test that, he put a level 50 
shaman against a level 50 warrior, both well equipped, both self buffed, 
without dancing. Then they duked it out toe to toe. Shaman won.
So yes, that could kind of pass for a tanking ability test.
