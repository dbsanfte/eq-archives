I believe the formula is more like some function of Level^3.  In addition, 
mobs give some function of (mob level)^2 in xp, so, barring seriously uber 
zone modifiers (like PoP planes and Paludal Caverns), it takes vastly 
longer to get each subsequent level.  Level 60 is an exception, it is a 
seriously easy level to make it through.
