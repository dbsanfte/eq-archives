But, you get to gain a whole 15 mana net by casting Yaulp V in a mere 24
seconds.  And it stacks with Clarity, PoTG, FTx.  That gives you an extra 1k
mana regen over a mere, um, 50ish minutes (recast time of 18 seconds,
casting time of 0.5, duration 24 seconds).  Not to mention the ATK/DEX/Haste
components.  How could you possibly be less than thrilled at the prospect?
:b

That's like an additional FT2.1 over and above everything else.  With the
right focus items, that can be increases to maybe as much as 2.5 mana/tick.
