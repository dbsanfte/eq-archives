Yeah...since my int is normally 208 with 218 cha i could drop both of
my opal encrusted schteins (each +25 cha) and carry the grandmaster
jewelers eyeglass for the same amount of cha and 10 int to boot. Not
to mention the bags. Dont forget to make the trophy you need an
artisans seal which has a mounted diamond, blue diamond, black
sapphire and jacinth each of which require a couple bars of velium.
Youll need a GM jeweler to make the artisan seal which is required for
each trophy. Even then, there is no guarantee that it will be
successful. I failed 2 out of 4 times making a couple velium diamond
wedding rings for a friends wedding.
