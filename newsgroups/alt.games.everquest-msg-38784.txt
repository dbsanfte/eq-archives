Is it the lv. 52 pet?  That thing's quite "vain".  It has 2 buffs: the
damage shield and shieldskin.  (Yes, both take quite a while to cast).  Plus
whenever u send it in, the earlier fire pets may cast once or even twice
before engaging in melee/taunts but this one takes 3x as long.  The reason?
It's too busy buffing itself with those 2 shields and...it's 3rd ability.
   The 52 fire pet also casts cancel magic on it's target if the mob has any
self-buffs up at all.  I say self because I malo each and every mob I fight
and that pet has NEVER cancelled my malo.  Therefore, it seems to only knock
down (or try to knock down) the buffs beneficial to the mob.

   Anyway, all this to say, if you mean that level pet it's probably the
other things its got going on that keeps it from ds'ing itself.
   DS it yourself, I say.  That O'Keil's suxor major anyway, so use your
own.  It's better AND if you're doing DS for the party then doing your pet
first tells u when the tanks need it again.
   Lastly, Shield of Lava is still less mana than Boon of Immolation unless
you have more than 4 tanks in your group.

Latah,
