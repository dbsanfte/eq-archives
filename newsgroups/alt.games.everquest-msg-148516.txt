You will find tailoring a royal pain in the butt.  Then, it will get hard.

After doing JC where you can sit at a vendor, buy the items, enchant, create
items, sell the results without ever moving from your spot, you will find
tailoring to be impossible.

Pottery is probably a good skill, as you can, as an enchanter, get the skill
up with just merchant bought items as I recall.  You can also actually
produce useful items, as you skill up at the higher levels.

Tailoring does use some enchanting, but mostly, it requires farming.  Lots
and lots of farming.  Then, it requires more farming.  The items you can
make, eventually, are quite nice.
