You *do* know that only one trial is based around high DPS, right?

As for mana, I've posted my shamans profile enough... he doesnt even break
4k mana at 65 - so when I did flaggings, at 60, with considerably less gear,
his mana pool was as small as a 60 shamans could be.  Despite that, despite
being a bot, he was used (to great success) in many flag sessions.

Druids? (they can insta-kill some of the waves, btw)
Enchanters? (slow), Shamans? (slow)
Which classes?

No. Only 1 trial is DPS based.
