This is a touchy issue, but for reasons other than what you would
expect.  We have a group of dedicated raiders, so much so that even
EXP nights were turning into raids.  We had to start setting aside 2
nights a week for 6-packs, and basically mandate no pick-up raids on
6-pack night (at least until late night, PoG generally has at least
two groups).  We're pretty flexible about letting folks take time off
to do non-raiding activities, but we do expect members to attend our
big raids.  Basically, the only issue we've really run into is people
who spend all their time powerleveling their other characters instead
of raiding.  (We do allow members who burn out on their main to switch
classes, and will even PL them if there is a need, this has only
happened twice so far.)

It depends on the guild.  I think every server has one 'uber-guild'
who runs roughshod over other guilds.  It's usually not even the most
powerful guild on the server, just the most vocal.  It's not a problem
most of the time, and you learn to avoid the jerk guilds, just like
you learn to avoid the single jerks.

In the case you've given, it's obviously his.  He wanted it, organized
a raid, and then got the drop.  Were he to leave, it would be his to
keep.  I'm thinking more of the situation where we kill undead Trak
for epic bits, a breastplate drops, and it's awarded to a needy
member.  They got a great item on a guild raid, it's expected to stay
in the guild.  Of course this rule is basically unenforcable, and you
rely on the honor of the person leaving.  We made it very clear that
if someone didn't return an item, we wouldn't hound them.  I can't
think of an item worth being a jerk about.

That works, until you see the late-night crew getting all the nice
armor upgrades and those who attend the epic hunts and stuff missing
out.  Basically, the idea is to ensure that items go to the
appropriate people, even if they're not on when the item drops.
(Hell, if it weren't a violation of policy to share accounts, I'm sure
that several folks would come back from vacation, hiatus, whatever to
find nice new items in their inventory.)
It does work out to NB4G, but the needy person doesn't always have to
be there when the item drops.  This is especially important on stuff
like Velious quest armor.
