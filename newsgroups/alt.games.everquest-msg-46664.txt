Delete all GD zone files.
Run the patch, select Velious patch.  It'll redownload the GD files
you just blew away.  You should now be able to log back in.

This happens quite often if you crash while zoning (or in your case,
kill EQ while "stuck" zoning).  You've corrupted the zone information
and everytime you attempt to log on, you're getting "stuck".

BTW, Greater Divide is easily the most fubarred zone in this game.
