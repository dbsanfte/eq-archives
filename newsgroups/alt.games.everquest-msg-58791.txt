When you reach level 50, one point of wisdom=10 mana.  So at lvl 25 one
point of wisdom=.5 mana.  Use this and your lvl to determine which is better
for you.  If you are a wisdom based caster, wisdom is used to determine
skill raises and trade skills, for intelligence based casters, it is
intelligence that is used for this.
