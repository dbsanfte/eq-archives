I think that the most recent changes, the addition of the new UI and the
bazaar, will be some of the most significant changes to the game over all.
Already the bazaar is changing the economy of the game.  Prices are dropping
and gear is easier to get than ever.  Vendor fodder is now bazaar fodder and
selling for a lot more.  This means that newbie players can make more money
at low levels and outfit themselves with decent gear a lot earlier.

It has been really interesting to follow the culture that is developing
around the bazaar and I wonder what the game will look like in a few more
months when the newness has worn off and it becomes a fixture in the game.
