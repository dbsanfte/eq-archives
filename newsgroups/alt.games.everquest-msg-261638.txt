Why not?  Remember that ultimitely, EQ is geared towards grouping, not 
soloing.  The amount that mobs hit for is just one factor in balancing, 
you have to consider number of hitpoints as well, and in the end, as I 
said, they are balancing the mobs such that a group can effectively fight 
them, they are not concerned with whether or not the mobs are soloable.
