Perhaps, since they now seem to chain cast, spells landed that started
before I FD due to lagg. Dont know for sure but seriously have not had
a successful FD in that situation yet. 

True the monk is still young so perhaps the skill level has something
to do with it. I really cant say why all I know is that the forth time
I pulled a CR in one day under those conditions the fun went out of
pulling. Im not the only one either, have heard the same from other
monks though all in the 20-30 level range. Will keep trying in hopes
you are right.
