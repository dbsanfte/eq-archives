No idea what N is for (my hotkeys don't have anything starting what that).
This is what i came up with as far as what's actually in my file:
(couldn't find an A)
B is for the top two combat icons (unchangable, melee and range attack)
C is for the bottom four combat icons
D is for ability buttons
E is for emotes (socials)
F is for inventory slots
G is for buttons off the "main page"
H is for spell gems

That's pretty much all i could find to make buttons out of.
