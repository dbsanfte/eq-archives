If you've got jets, you have the complex chemistry for bombs and guns.  This
world doesn't have either.  It's a world of swords and sorcery.  I'm not
saying that there should be no way to get from point a to n.  I'm just
suggesting it should have a cost.  The pedestals have made it free.  Last
time I got on a airliner, I had to pay for the ticket.  I think that still
holds true.  Do you think, in reality, that if someone had the capability to
create such travel, they would not want to sell it?

Believe me.  I use root and nuke.  But, when root doesn't hold and I don't
have enough spell points left to root again AND kill the monster, then I get
an "opportunity" to use my stick (bash and nuke).  If I had to go against a
wandering greenblood with just the stick, I'd get beaten like a rug.
