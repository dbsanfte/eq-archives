Going on the "non aggro to good guys" statement, check out the level
30-ish goblin camp in BBM (where the blade of nobility drops). Those
are non-aggro. Dervish Cutthroats start out non-aggro faction (And the
only accusations of wrong-doings I've come across against them is from
the FP Militia, who are corrupt. Then again, I haven't paid close
attention to every single little newbie quest out there in the
region...). So, you telling me these guys are "innocents", too? I
don't have the "it wouldn't be in the game if they didn't mean for us
to kill it" mentality, no. But I do have the mentality that the
creators of the world know whether the faeries have given any reason
for paladins to be killing them or not better than any of us do. Your
"plot hole" is based on assumption.
