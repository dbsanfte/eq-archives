Yep, it's your linksys router. This problem has been around for along
time, I was kinda hoping Linksys had fixed it so I could upgrade my
firmware, but apparently not. You need to downgrade your firmware to
1.40.1, this should fix the problem.    Anyone know if Linksys is
investigating this ? I searched their website and find no mention of
it ?
