We already *know* that race/religion/class have penalties/bonuses 
applied to many factions. (Which is why a Dwarf pali can never get 
higher than indifferet in cabilis, *and* can never earn more than 2000 
positive hits in cabilis.

But if you design a quest to require +2000 absolute faction, and you 
start a half-elf ranger at 0; Then the ranger needs 2000 hits to reach 
the +2000 and unlock the quest. No problem so far.

Now if you want to allow the iksar to do the same quest, *and* you want 
to penalize the iksar, you can't. If you give the iksar a -1000 penalty 
to his starting 'deeds faction'... he will *never* be able able to get 
his faction to +2000 (barring illusions and other modifiers to 
dodge/overcome his penalty).

However, if you 'initialize' his starting faction at -500, then you've 
made it harder, but still possible, for him to move it to +2000.

It wouldn't surprise me if this is the case in limited circumstances.

I think this is more likely, but I have no reason to rule out your other 
theory as plausible.
