Scroll your text window until the threat is showing, then do 
'/report <playername>'.  That saves the offending text for a GM to
look at.

You would then need to petition--the report itself doesn't do anything
of that nature.  Personally, I'd only petition if the threat was
really carried out, with the report serving as evidence of intent...
