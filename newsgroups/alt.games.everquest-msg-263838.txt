I don't know about the higher end game, my highest in eq2 is still only 
13 but I've gotten all my gear from quests.  Halfway decent stats for 
noob stuff.  Sometimes I don't have alot of time to play but I've still 
got over 100 quests done (love the quest journal).  Might take a bit to 
find groups, took 15 mins to get a group together to kill a quest NPC 
but that required everyone in the group to have the quest and to be high 
enough to not die while we were fighting.

You won't see buff bots on EQ2, the buffs cost concentration and you 
only get 5 slots of concentration at a time.  And any priest can rez, 
shaman, druid or cleric.  You get rez spell at 5 before you specialize 
into class.  So far the death penalty hasn't been too great.  Not that I 
die incredibly much.  Well, I do die alot, I solo way too much.  Most of 
the time, rezzes aren't much use in EQ2.  You don't have to get your 
stuff, but you do leave a 'spirit shard' where you died.  If you have 
too many shards it does affect your stats, your strength goes down stuff 
like that.  There is a limit of 5 shards, after 5 the oldest one poofs 
(i think). Plus they poof after 3 real-life days.  Also, no one else can 
see your shard but if you don't know where you died, you can use 
'waypoints' to show you exactly where to go to get your shard, it'll 
even tell you what zone your shard is in.  if you want to get a rez you 
don't release the shard, your corpse will lay on the ground till it gets 
rezzed.
