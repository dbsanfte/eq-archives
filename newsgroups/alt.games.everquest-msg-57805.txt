Let's see......... where to begin?
Top posting...
Obnoxious...
Abusive...
Clueless as to point of discussion or events being described...
Well, let's push on anyway, shall we?

Listen, dickless. Why *anyone* would tell their pet to sit down in the
middle of a hard pressed battle is beyond me, but reading your post, I
suppose the fact that you tried it twice isn't that surprising. Now if
you look carefully below you'll see that, even though I didn't spell it
out word-for-one-sylable-word, I was obviously not even trying to get
the pet to sit during battle. I was *allowing* him to sit *AFTER* a
battle when he was WAY down in points so he could regen faster and get
up off his ass to protect me while I was medding/healing up. Somebody
else suggested that he could be told to guard while sitting and still
regen fast, which I didn't know, and havent' tried to test yet. I
normally leave him standing to guard while I med. Perhaps the sentence
"Other than that, if I'm medding blind looking at my spell book I want
old' Jabober's ass standing guard and getting the first swing at
anything coming to disrupt my meditation."
Hello? Is this on?
