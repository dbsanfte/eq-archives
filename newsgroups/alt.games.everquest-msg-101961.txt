Hello all,

My wife and I have both been on a hiatus from EQ since around the luclin
launch.  Nothing to do with luclin just kinda lost interest for a while.
With the price increase we were thinking about just cancelling but decided
to play again to make sure (yeah, we have addictive personalities).  Anyway,
we went to a new server because in the past we would twink our new chars and
get bored by the time we got them to level 10 or so.  Her main was an
enchanter and mine was a druid.  We also decided to try new classes.  We're
having a blast.

Anyway, I wanted to go to freeport from gfay and while waiting for the boat
someone said that the boats are broke and you need a port from a GM to get
there. True?

I heard you don't have to stare at the book while meditating at any level
but when my wife tried it she still got the book.  Neither of us made it to
35 before (I made 29 and she made 30).  What's the trick if it's true?

I decided to be a bard.  I like it.  I heard (again) that I got meditate to
make learning spells faster, even though I don't need mana.  It's not on my
skill list.  Do I get it?  Does it matter?

I really haven't kept up and don't want to spoilerize myself but I do need
to learn more about being a bard (I'm level 5 right now).  I've found 4 or 5
sites and I've learned to twist (I can do 2 reliably and 3 sometimes).  The
sites don't seem to be current though.  Are there any good bards sites that
are current out there?

That's enough for now I guess.  It's good to be playing again.  Thanks in
advance.

Lewis
