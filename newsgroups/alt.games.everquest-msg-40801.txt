Shaddup, Effexor!  Did you do this huge amount of work and compilation on EQ
facts?!  No, you just wasted everyone's time to flame!

Well here's your counter-flame, lamo.  Use newsgroups for what they were
designed and contribute.

Now before I make myself a total horse's arse, here's some feedback to Matt
(who I owe a hearty *bow*! for this mountain of work).

Matt, I'd up the Mage's pets to 10.  You're making a point about regents for
the pets but that is really minor.  Every, single mage knows about the fact
that there is one and only one thing holding them down: malachite.  We need
no food,water,bandages or even weapons (we make those too).  We just need
those spell components.  As such I have never, ever been held down by them.
The reason?  Since level 1 I know I have to have them or I'm useless to
any/all groups and I'm useless to myself.  So I, like all other high-level
mages, carry a 10-slot backpack and a half full of them.

I digress, though.  The power of the pet is what counts in this category.
Mage's > necro pets.  Maybe a few during the levels could beat a mage pet in
a 1-on-1 pet duel but that all ends at level 51 (and this is about level 60
classes afterall), at which point no Necro pet can prevail against the
mages' ones.  The power that these 4 different types have are more
far-reaching than the necro pets.

My 2 cp, thanks again for this hard work.  It is very good stats.

Hasta,

-Grim
