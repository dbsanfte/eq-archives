I see discussion of the Yaulp below, but whats that Hammer?  If its
a summoned no-drop weapon of crapliness (like the entire rest of the
cleric summon weapon line) I simply can't believe they'd bother.  If
its an upgrade to UHOF, though, I'm insane enough to be keenly
interested.

Oooh, a stunningly bad spell.  Cost to cast higher than CHeal, time to
cast longer than any heal but CHeal, heals barely more than the
massively superior Celestial Elixer.  I don't even cast Divine Light
more than once or twice a day... CHeal, CE, and Remedy are
my staples.  Give me an upgrade to Remedy... more heal but
still FAST and we will talk.  Upgrade the relatively useless
Divine Light... and do so by making it slower and cost more mana?
What are we thinking?

This one might concievably be useful, at least, I'd have to do the
math to see if its cheaper than using traditional group heals.  Might
I add that I fiercely miss Heroic Bonds, the ultimate group heal
if you don't have POTG/Aego to prevent it working.  At any rate,
group heals are rarely important or efficient, you need a situation
where most if not all your group members are taking damage and
staying inside your group cast range.  When group heals -are-
useful, its often a paladin casting them!
