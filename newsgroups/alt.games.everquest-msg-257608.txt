Except why would the rarity be the specific cause?

I've got plenty of junk dating back years from defunct GM events and such,
things that don't drop anymore and will never drop again.  Plenty of these
items are every bit as rare as Rubi BPs, maybe even more, but I wouldn't be
able to get any more than vendor price in the bazaar for them.  Hell,
selling them to NPC vendors would probably be the only way I'd get any cash
from them.  If it was simply rarity, everyone would be banging down my door
to get them.  I just don't see people ponying up a lot of money for an item
with attributes the equivalent or better of which can be obtained for much
cheaper, no matter how rare the items.

So it can't simply be rarity.  As for utility, there are plenty of cheaper
items that have greater utility than a rubi BP.

Nah, I'm more inclined to believe that it's something different.  Someone
pays a lot for a rubi bp because you can wander around wearing it showing
off that you're an 0ld sk00l f00l.  Rarity may play a part in that, but it's
secondary to the status that lots of people place on that item.  And that's
the QED definition of "carrying a price because of its name".
