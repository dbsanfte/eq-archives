Thats something that every warrior really has to decide for himself, and learn
through experience.  Keep in mind though that there is absolutely nothing that
prevents you from carrying two different weapon sets, one for damage and one
for taunting, and swapping in the correct one for the situation.

For instance, these days my normal setup is to wield a Sebilite Croaking Dirk
main hand 10 dam 18 delay, and to offhand a Long Sword of Etheral Energy, 16
damage 29 delay, +5 magic damage.   The long sword has a somewhat low taunt
factor due to it's slow speed, but I like the damage, and I've found that
being my level, I can usually get away with using it and still maintain aggro
constantly.    If I ever am in a situation where I'm having trouble keeping
things taunted (such as when I'm grouped with one of our rangers who hasn't
learned the wonders of the jolt spell, or another ranger that throws his two
piddly shit damage DoT's on each and every mob, then wonders why he can never
jolt things off of himself afterwards...)  then I'll put a Gorgana Spiked
Club, 12 dam 23 delay in main hand, and offhand the Croaking Dirk.

And on Monday, I'm going to try for my holy grail . ; )   The ultimate
taunting weapon that we are able to get as a guild at this time.

For taunt, you want a lower delay weapon in both your primary and secondary
slots.   For damage, you want the weapon with the best ratio in your off hand.
