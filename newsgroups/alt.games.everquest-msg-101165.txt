Ill probably go for the 2 year. The price hike doesnt bother me much...
inflation happens and it was only a matter of time. In another 2 years it
will probably go up again. Sounds like verant are worried about people
wandering off to another mmorpg. Maybe with all this money the can employ
someone to fix the GD zone bug.
