This bit I can answer. The velium battle axe procs velium shards (up to 12
points direct damage) once you reach level 25 and over. How often it procs
at 25 and after is determined by your dexterity.

Until you reach 25, you will get the "you do not have the will to command
this weapon". You will see this message often in your career as it means the
weapon you are trying to proc requires a higher level than you currently
are. Most weapons are next to useless by the time you can actually proc them
BTW, this also is something best gotten used to early...
