Most of my characters have been finding one of their hotkeys doing
wonky things, like trying to click on my jboots tells me I can't
eat any more or I'd explode.  Or invoking my Succor item opens a
bag instead.

Eventually it sank in that, in each case, the key was invoking the
slot one above the one it was supposed to.  I think that when they
added the new energeion slot or whatever it's called, it caused some
of the other inventory slots to get renumbered so that the numbers
baked into the hotkeys are wrong now.  Probably only affects keys
for top-level carried slots, but it's probably worth checking your
others as well.  (Hm, seems to have knocked out the ammo slot, where
some of my characters carry hotkeyed bridles.)
