I got 2 flawless diamonds and some essense of sunlight this way on separate
occasions.  I felt sure I was mistaken about what the item was in both
instances, but decided to go with the gut feeling both times.  Sunlight got
me 500 plat or so in short order -- I think I had gotten 2 or 3 vials from
that one vendor.  The flawless diamonds took a while, but in the end, I
traded them for 3000 plat in credit toward a black acrylia halberd for a
friend's paladin.
