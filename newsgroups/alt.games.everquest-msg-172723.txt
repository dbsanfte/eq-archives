Whether it's a habit or not isn't the point.  It annoys others, has a 
good chance of making the griefers retaliate and causing even *more* 
zone disruption (and just because the GM might get there faster doesn't 
make that a good idea), and leaves you on the same level as the idiots 
you were trying to get rid of, in the view of anybody else who just had 
their chat screen spammed to hell.
