Hehe, smart in turning down those invites...

Believe me when I say the following:  Forget about WIS.  Unless you
can get your MR/FR/CR upto 150+ buffless *AT THE SAME TIME*, mana will
be useless.

You'll either be dead, busy healing yourself or feared and running
around like a damn loon while the dragon rips your head off.

A cleric with 100 WIS while 150 MR/CR against Vox would be FAR more
useful than a cleric with 200 WIS and 100 MR/CR.

Remember, the numbers above are BUFFLESS.  Naggy/Vox has that annoying
"poof your buffs while I nuke your butt" AoE and that cycles every 12
freaking seconds.
