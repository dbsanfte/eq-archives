Just thought i would relay my experience of doing Jboot quest yesterday...

I had a bad start to the day having been killed in Rathe Mountains by a Hill
Giant, two Cyclops and three Giant Skeletons so bored and annoyed I headed
off to OOT on the off chance that the Ancient Cyclops was not being camped.
On arrival as expected it was camped by two guys from a guild (I wont
mention) which - I had seen them two days previously. I asked them how  long
they had been camping it - they'd been there 3 days! So I went off to Sister
Island to revenge my murder in my younger days on stepping off the boat.
After happily blitzing the Sisters for 20 mins and collecting some weapons
for my pet I go back to Cyclops island and the campers have left. A cyclops
is up and dispatch him with relative ease - 7 mins later a troll appears,
next spawn aqua goblin, pirate, pirate, Ancient Cyclops! I had been there
only about 30 mins and here is the fabled AC. Pretty easyily dispatched (lvl
41 necro)- Snare, Pet, Fear, DoT - repeat. Nervous few moments when snare
wore off and he's still feared - he runs miles into the sea on does not
return. I swim out for a bit and he comes sprinting back. Anyway he dies,
and I have one Ring of the Ancient Cyclops!

I head of to West Commons and a Shadowed Man is easily taken care of. I head
of to Rathe - on arrival I send a tell to ranger asking if Hasten is up -
he's not. I suddenly realised I'd forgotten the gold pieces (Doh!). Head
back and pick them - also invest in a bottle of SoW potion.

I come back to Rathe and immediately on arrival someone shouts Hasten is up.
I take a slug of SoW and set about looking for him. Around the next corner
he zips past I manage to target him and frantically hail him. Arrrg - he
does not stop. I keep following him but he is outpacing me - he weaves about
alot and this gives me chances to catch him up. After a frantic 30 secs he
responds - I get my Jboots!

The tips I would give on doing this quest are: Don't camp the Cyclops, come
visit regurlarly and give it half an hour or so, if he don't pop do
something else. I have been to OOT on numerous occassions and seen the
ancient cyclops when I was not even looking for him or new of this quest.
When you go to chase Hasten, just take the bear essentials - stuff for
Hasten and invest in a bottle SoW if you follow him very carefully (he
weaves about like a man possessed) you will catch him even though he will be
able to outpace. Don't have invis on and make sure he is target before
hailing him.

I think I was pretty fortunate to do this in such a short amount of time -
don't expect it to be as easy as this.

P.S The Jboots are just soooo nice - gloat, gloat
