While Sareman is of course correct to open the Inventory window, I've taken 
it a step further and gone into the control panel, to the keys tab, and for 
commands, at the very bottom, you can assign any unused key or key 
combination to open and close all inventory bags as well... so I've set up 
CTRL,Shft, O to open and CTRL, SHFT, C to close... this makes things real 
easy to see everything you have, and how many slots you might have available 
for looting or other storage reasons...

Hope this helps...
