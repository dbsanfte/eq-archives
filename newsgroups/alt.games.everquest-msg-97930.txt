As a druid, the wisdom will serve you better, since druids (especially in
this day and age of EQ, where nobody wants to set foot in a dungeon until
51 when they have to) really don't get swung at much. Although this does
depend on what "type" of druid you are, odds are the wisdom will be of
greater benefit than the AC. Druids are about the ONLY class that can make
that  claim however.
