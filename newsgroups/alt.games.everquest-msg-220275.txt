So you're in the right exit corridor camp in PoJ, with a full group of 
six (all shrunk obviously) and you get three 'Festering Rats' which are 
all beating on the cleric.  You can see three bits of text which say 
'Festering Rat'.  You can see two are mezzed and not moving.  You click. 
  One of the 'Festering Rat' names starts to flash, and your target 
window says 'Festering Rat'.

Still can't tell which of the rats is targetted.  In close quarters the 
flashing text is useless.

On top of that, at medium to long range, the flashing text is useless 
because it's not there.
