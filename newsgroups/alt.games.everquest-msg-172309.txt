12) And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that =
sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the =
money-changers, and the seats of them that sold doves,=20

13) And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the =
house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.

14) And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed =
them.

15) And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that =
he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to =
the son of David; they were sore displeased,

16) And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto =
them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings =
thou hast perfected praise?

I have no respect for the things that go on here, and I will continue my =
prophecy for the appointed time clothed in sackcloth as God is merciful =
and has allowed still time to repent before you are damned for all =
eternity. The truth is before you and you will not be able to see it. =
Look and be dismayed!
