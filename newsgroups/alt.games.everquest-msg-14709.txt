I can see both sides of the coin.  Some people will exploit holes in the
game, and why shouldn't they if they are so inclined?  It isn't their fault
the hole is there.  But in a single player game, who cares if you exploit
and cheat, it only affects you.

On the other side, the exploit could mess up the economy, could give people
an easy way to powerlevel, and change the game that will affect others.

Brad had a good point when he said if you leave your door unlocked, sure its
your fault... if someone breaks in and steals something they are still
committing a crime.

I don't know if suspending people is the way to solve the problem...but it
sure sounds like a good deterent.  It will most likely drive that person
from the game permanently though.
