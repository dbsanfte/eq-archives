Part of the new Plane of Knowledge's function will be to act
as a travel hub.  Think "Nexus" except it's from (at least)
city-to-city instead of spire-to-spire.

From the official web site:

"Players of all levels will benefit from the Plane of Knowledge
that hosts scores of new quests and opens portals to Norrath
making travel easier than ever."

and

"How will I get to the Planes?  The planes will be accessed
through numerous portals throughout the existing world."

I haven't seen any other information on how the portals will
work (whether they'll be simple "click on teleporter" types
or act like the Nexus spires with NPC wizards for porting.
As a guess, I'd think it'll just be click-type teleporters
in or near all the starting cities and *possibly* in other
NPC cities like Thurgadin, Firona Vie, and Shadowhaven.
