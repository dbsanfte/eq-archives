Good points. The key to soloing is being self-sufficent period. That
means being a good player with the abilities it takes. The main thing
is that no two zones are the same. One zones favors one class while
another favors a different class. 

The killing of mobs can be done by many classes but there are times
when in a remote zone with no chance of an easy rez whos gonna be able
to survive the CR or avoid it in the first place. 

Druids hands down the easiest and most able to do it all. Having said
that they dont kill the fastest, that wasnt the question asked. 

Second is Bards due to lack of ports. Although the leaning curve is
steep the fun curve is excellent and there is no substitute for plate
armor. 

Necros are great, they kill fast and have many tools to use, place
them tied with Bards. 

Wizzies? well they kill fast and get killed fast, have ports and
enough tools for the job. That snare isnt the best after all and hit
points are low. So they have to fall to third. 

Six months ago would have included Monks in this but now post
ruthless-evil-unwarrented nerf its not an issue. Although they have
the ability to go to places no one else can to get to specific camps
that ability has been seriously nerfed. Never could understand why
melees get so craped on in this game.

These are the only classes Ive soloed into the 50s so take it for what
its worth.
