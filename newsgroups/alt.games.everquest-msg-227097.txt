I think I'm weird; I love MLing.  I don't know why, I just do.  I think it
partly has to do with the fact that corpses sitting around bug me, so this
way I can make sure they get promptly cleared out.

When I sell/split at the end, I actually do the math and if it's a
difference of more than one or two plat, I will round up out of my own
pocket to even things out fairly.  I'm not in it to come out ahead, I just
like doing it.

Doesn't hurt I tend to have a ton of free space on my chanter and all
weight-reducing bags.

If you can't click-target a corpse, type /target a_whirl or whatever and
then /loot.  Ex:  Whirling dervish corpse is whirling_derv, or if it's a
flowkeeper architect, you can just type /target a_f and it'll grab the
corpse.
