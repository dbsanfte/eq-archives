I killed it 2 time last night.  Both times it had 5500 +/- 20 HP. at level
49 with 1100 ac it was hitting for about 20 on average.  I was in fob simply
to save people from this monster.  I hope they fix it soon. I watched it go
through a group of 14 - 16 's in about 30 seconds before I could get there.
