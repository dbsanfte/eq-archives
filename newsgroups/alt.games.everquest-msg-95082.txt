I'd suggest that you get 2 (or more) groups together and go into:

Mistmoore (excellent training dungeon, high fatality rates if you don't work
together good) levels 25+

Dalnir's (great exp, nice loot, more of a single group place though) levels
20-40 (better off 25-40 for single group)

Kaesora(great exp, slightly better loot than Dalnir, but also slightly
higher level) levels 30-45

Crystal Caverns is also excellent, many places to set up down here, however
its more on the beaten path so you might have some competition there,
whereas with the other dungeons, Dalnir and Kaesora are usually empty,
except maybe some people getting Xalgoz fangs, Mistmoore might have a
mid-20's exp group at the zone in, but there's rarely anyone inside the
castle. Levels 25-40

If you desire extremely fast exp for a group 35-42 or so, the zone in room
in Kedge Keep, killing fishes, you'll need EB though, so have a mage for
waterstones, or a druid/shaman/enchanter/ranger for Enduring Breath (and at
least 4 stacks of fish scales), however, the loot is fairly bad, and you do
NOT want to leave the first floor area, as the rest of the dungeon is mostly
too high for you at that level.

You might also be able to do Droga or Nurga with one or two 35+ groups, I'm
not too familiar with the zones beyond the fact that they're both usually
empty except for *maybe* an Idol or shroud camper in Droga. (looks like good
exp in Droga, entirely blue at 45, excellent loot at a couple points if you
get rare drops)
