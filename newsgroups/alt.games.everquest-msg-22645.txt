My favorite is this senario..

you begin to cast a spell
a_mob_01 is rooted
your grasping roots has broken cuz its a POS spell
a_mob_01 crushes you for ridiculous damage
you begin to cast a spell
your spell is interrupted
fizzle
fizzle
fizzle
a_mob_01 crushes you so hard you feel it in RL
fizzle
fizzle
fizzle
fizzle
fizzle
a_mob_01 laffs at your feeble attempt to melee it
you begin to cast a spell
your spell is interrupted
fizzle
fizzle
you dont have enuff mana for this spell
a_mob_01 spits in your eye
LOADING....please wait
