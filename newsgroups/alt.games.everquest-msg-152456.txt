It's not as "real endgame" as you think.

A few givens, feel free stop me if you dont' agree.

With the current caps on AC, if you're over 1200 AC, you've got the best
protection in the game.

On E'ci, there are public ToV raids to Halls of Testing, farming Skyshrine
armor.  Anyone reguardless of guild may attend, so we'll set level 60 with
full Skyshrine as the highest most people can reasonably achieve without
"effort" (Raiding guild killing endgame mobs, etc).

Assuming they dont' have pure shit in the non-ToV covered slots, every tank
class can achieve 1200 AC in full Skyshrine armor.

So, at least on E'ci...  every plate class save Clerics can equal the AC
based damage mitigation of a warrior.  Monks are also at the same cap, due
to the huge AC bonus for keeping thier weight under the limit.  (In decent
gear.  Obviously not Skyshrine monk armor, since it sucks, but the more
commonly available All/All items)

At level 60 with moderate gear, they are.  Thier bonuses are that high.
