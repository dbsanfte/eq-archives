I'd go with Graefaxe on this one.  Your first challenge as a rogue will be
to get your stamina over 100, so you don't slow down on long fights or chain
pulls.   Also, strength items are as common as dirt... my warrior has never
*tried* to get plus strength items, yet his gear still adds over 80
strength.  Rogue gear is similar.  Good stamina items are *much* harder to
find, and generally cost more when you do find them.
