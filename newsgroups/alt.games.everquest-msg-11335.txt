Because many of us change the INI file in such a way that the "A" key is
no longer used for auto attack. All it takes is getting killed by your
Guild Trainer once to make you switch it. For example, my Auto-Attack
key is set to "~" for the simple fact that, AFAIK, it's impossible to
even intentionally hit that character in the game.
