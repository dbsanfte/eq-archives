See, you prove my point.   Does everything in the game have to turn a profit?  
 Can't you not let someone loot it just to help someone out?   Are you truely 
that selfish?

Yeah, like a tracker at that level is going to want to spend that amount of 
time in SK, when they could be getting XP elsewhere.   Get a clue, it's a 
random spawn in huge freaking zone.


>If you can't afford 20k, perhaps you aren't ready for your epic.  

Not everyone at that level has that kind of money just laying about.   Haven't 
you forgotten little things like having to pay 5K and up for your spells so 
you might be alittle effective at 50+?     I'm sure a lot of people will tell 
you that they don't have that kind of plat just sitting around, regardless of 
level.   Not all of us are phat lewt farmers like you are, huh?
