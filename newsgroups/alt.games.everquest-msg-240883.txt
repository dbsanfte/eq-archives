I havnt played extensively yet since patch, spent maybe 15 minutes looking
around before going into trader mode for the day, heres what I noticed.

my vah shir can no longer walk over objects he once before could, such as
tables in the pok library main floor, of the vendor tables in potranq (not a
big deal I guess since not all races could walk over the stuff to begin
with, but VERY annoying when you're acustomed to being able to)

I noticed I was getting hung up on corners, the stairs to get into library
for example, I got hung up twice on those.

I witnessed a mgb at the pok bank, there were 227 people in pok at the time
and it looked like every damn one of them were at the bank, there was a
breif moment of lag while it cached (I guess), like very very short. and
after that NO lag what so ever. truely a first. very nice work on sony's
part.
However, I did notice several times at random times that same breif moment
of lag, as if it were recaching the world around me as I moved.
