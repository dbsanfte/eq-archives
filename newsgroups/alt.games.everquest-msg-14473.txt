}The next item on our shopping list was the scroll. It drops off of the

}However, in the lookout room, (first smaller, formerly two spawn room to
}the right as you enter guard room) there is a new spawn point in the
}corner just to your right as you enter the room. It's on a seven minute
}timer and produces either "a goblin" (new) or "a goblin thief" (also
}new).  We were in there for three spawns. Got two goblins and one thief.
}Both thieves dropped the scroll. We also picked up two from crazed gobs
}that got pulled up from the war room.

Wow.  So, I killed a couple 'a goblin thief's last night in Warslik's 
Wood, and they dropped a parchment with a fragment of lame poetry on it.  
Is that the scroll for GB, then?
