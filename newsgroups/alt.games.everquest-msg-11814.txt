Ughh... I hate Warsliks Wood due to the animated trees.  Lots of mobs gang
up on you when running around there and the slow framerate from these trees
makes it that much harder.  The trees are low so you can't see and there are
alot of steep slopes.  Whomever designed this zone was on some heavy drugs.

On the other hand, I have spent a good deal of time in the giant fort there,
but the lag problem is nonexistant once you get in.  The fort really rocks
and I have been getting some good exp, loot and money.  Only one forest loop
has dropped and I've probaby taken down 200+ giants.

But I do dread the run back to the OT zone from the fort to do banking and
selling.  Even though most of the mobs are blue on the path, it is such a
pain.  I count my blessings every time I reach the OT zone and didn't have
to fight 3 or 4 wandering mobs on the way.  Sure will be happy when I get
invis.
