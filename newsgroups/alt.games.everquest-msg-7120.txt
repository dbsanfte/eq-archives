I've hunted in groups in Overthere since level 27 (permanently since
level 29) with my druid. At 37 I can still make a bubble and a half in
2 hours with a good group, with or without clarity/manasong :)

For soloing... stonegazer cockatrices, sabretooth tigresses, thorny
succulants and sarnak berzerkers at low-mid 30s; stoneleer
cockatrices, sabretooth tigers, spiked succulants and sarnak knights
at the higher levels. Kunark rhinos are a pain to solo when they
resist snare; they're fast and hit very hard.

And I still wouldn't go there at 30 expecting to solo; Frontier
Mountains would be somewhat better suited for that level.
