It was cool when it first started...  Now, several days into it, it's a pain
in the arse...  I managed to get FlameWeaver for my bard (nothing for my
Druid)...  The only reason I got the bard weapon is because a guildie had
just killed something and found it...  and kept on the corpse until I got
there...

Otherwise, you got all the 50+'s swooping in and KSing everything in sight,
taking everything for themselves.  I got fed up and wandered elsewhere...
Unfortunately, we (a few guildies and I) have been wanting to hunt giants in
RM, but that's kinda out, due to the ongoing event there...  Oh well...  At
least Kunark is untouched by the GM's...  *crosses fingers*
