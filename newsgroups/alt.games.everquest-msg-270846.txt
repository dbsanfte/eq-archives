So I get on my server's list for a rare spawn, and arrange my schedule 
around picking it up. On the day I go to claim my spot in the rotation, 
I have trouble getting to the spawn point due to the heavy trains and 
fighting goin on in the zone, but I arive at the approximate spawn time, 
only to be told that some other group has snatched the kill out from 
under me. (Spawn times are after all, approximate.) I call a gm, but he 
says there's nothing he can do. So now I'm stuck trying to get this last 
spawn for the epic quest I'm on, and the damn server list means it will 
be next year before I get a reasonable shot.


Translation: Went to town yesterday to pick up my order from Best Buy 
(gah) of .Hack//Quarantine (Volume 4) (a PS2 RPG for a friend for 
Christmas). The last thing I need for my Christmas shopping to be complete.

They sold it out from under me.. after I had already PAID for it.

Assholes.

Manager told me there was nothing he could do. I told him he could 
explain that to the BBB, the complaints department at Best Buy 
corperate, etc... Not that I expect any satisfaction at all.

Anyway, there is no way for me to get this before Christmas now...
damn time limited epic quests.
