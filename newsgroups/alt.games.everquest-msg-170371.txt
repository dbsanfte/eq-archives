I somehow doubt the production servers will be seeing this one for a
while. I think it's got a long ways to go to be "ready for prime time".

1. A fair percentage of people who typed Alt-Enter immediately crashed.
2. Another slice of them were toggling window mode *every* time they hit
Alt without Enter. This of course makes other nifty keyboard things
impossible.
3. As yet, the window'd EQ is not resizable, nor can it be minimized. If
you want to open another application, you'll eitehr have to do it from
the Start menu, or drag the EQ window around until you can see the
desired desktop icon.

But it's a nice idea. I'd like to keep a couple browser windows with
things like Alakhazam, beastiary, and a couple other resources running
in the background.
