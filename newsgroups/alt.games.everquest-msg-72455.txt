Ok .. since beastlords are like 100% dependent on their pet (being
nothing but very weak monks without it):

I guess the 50% exp rule if the pet does more damage is still being
used for beastlords. Now does this make sense? It's like saying if
a wizard does more damage with his spells than his melee skills, he
only gets 50% exp. I wonder what Verants anwer to that is...
