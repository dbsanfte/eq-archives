   Ok, he thinks that Google Groups = Usenet.  Not the best of signs, but perhaps he
simply doesn't post very much, and only from google.  At least he doesn't think we
are a mailing list.

    Yep, pretty odd that he got those domains.  I'm frankly surprised that Sony
didn't snap them up.  Perhaps they are too busy working on the new game, as well as
providing new content for Classic EQ, to do the obvious?  Makes we wonder what other
obvious stuff they'll gloss over in their rush to get this project out at the
expected time, assuming they do make their time-table.
   As for his site itself, well, I kinda liked it.  It has a nice look to it, and is
easy enough to use and read.  Yeah, the begging for money is kind of annoying, but
less so than pop-up adds would be.  The actual information content is well done if a
bit sparse, which is to be expected a year before release date.  The FAQ was
interesting, but reading through it gets to be annoying because you must click on
each subject, then click back to the topics.  The screenshot section is well done,
and I expect that if this site manages to stay up, will get more pics as the release
date approaches.  I like that he has forums, and his link section is decent as well. 
All in all I would give it a "B".

           and still sometimes gets the urge.
