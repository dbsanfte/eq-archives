I personally don't have any problem with many of the "illegal" names, so
long as it is kept clean.  Sony, otoh, doesn't want to get sued by IHOP
because some clown used the name Ihop.  It's not likely they would, but
lawyers sometimes can't see the forest for all the trees.  Their game, their
rules.  Get over it.

Cheers,
Eric
