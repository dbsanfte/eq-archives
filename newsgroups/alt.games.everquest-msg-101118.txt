I'm sorry, could you point out where he said you did?

Which really is what SOE has done. Even at the initial release prices,
EQ and the expansions have been cheap.

Go ahead and add the monthly service fee on there as well, then work
out how many hours you've played and done other EQ related things.

Now calculate the dollars per hour price of the game. It's not just
cheap. It's absurdly cheap. 

Someone else came up with a guesstimate that a player who has been in
game since day one, and who has bought all the expansions, has paid in
the neighborhood of $500. That describes my situation pretty well.
I've got something like 120 days /played, or 2880 hours. That's
seventeen cents per hour, and I'm not even a diehard.
