Can't quote where I read it, but I've always heard they ONLY scan the EQ
directory it was installed to, and anything within it, to check for altered
files and other programs.  And I'm not even sure if THEY do that, or if the
program does it when you run it (more like Windows' "system file check"
isn't Microsoft scanning your system, it's Windows scanning itself).
