I'm stereotyping a bit here, ya know. I know a female blonde wood elf
druid who is played by a guy, and you would NEVER be able to tell.
Heck, I roleplay a bit with my druid from time to time, and she's
definitely not a halfling. (Speaking of halflings, someone remind me
to take my SK and kill some before leaving Nektulos - she needs to
work on baking)

Pff. I'm female and I liked watching the way Lara moved. She's
graceful, ya know. While I was writing my thesis, I'd take TB breaks
and try various 'cool' ways to climb up whatever, such as getting up a
stack of blocks by jumping sideways, forward, backwards, sideways and
never once turning around to realign myself. Looked really funky.
