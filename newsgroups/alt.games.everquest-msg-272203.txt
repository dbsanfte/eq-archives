It depends on the buffs.  Some suck down power like mad, others dont' cost you
power at all.   In Alchemy for instance, attempting to keep even two buffs up
you run into power issues.   But in woodworking I could use 3 each round
forever, without running out.

Not really.   Your events are only countered if you hit the correct skill
*after* the event occurs.   If you're using the monkey at a keyboard approach
to hitting buffs, then you've got about a 1 in 3 chance that the button  you
smacked right after the event popped was the correct one.   Hitting the wrong
buff immediately after counts as a failure, and gives you the bad effects.

As for why you would not use 3 buffs each turn...  I've found that the more
buffs I use, the lower my success chances seem to be.   In any given
tradeskill round, there are four possible outcomes. Progress / durability
change is before buffs.  Critical success +100 progress, no durability change.
Normal success, +50 progress, -10 durability.   Normal failure no
progress, -50 durability.  Critical failure, -50 progress, -100 durability.

I haven't logged it, but with a bunch of experimenting, I'm noticing that
using only one buff or none at all, I have almost all normal successes, with a
decent amount of critical successes.  Using three or four buffs (you can get
them up sometimes) I have tons of normal failures, and more than a few
critical failures.

I think with each buff you press, your success chance on the round goes down,
even if the buff doesn't additionally have the description "Lowers success
chance.".  Two buffs seems to be my break even.   Still a decent chance of
success, and with the right combination of buffs you can get some decent
bonuses running.   It also leaves you a chance to hit a third buff quickly if
the event spawns midway through the crafting round.
