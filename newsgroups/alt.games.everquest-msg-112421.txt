    I'm one too, only been playing for a year and a couple
of months, about.  Further more, I don't see why people want
to play beta.  I want to play a game after the major bugs
have ironed out other fearless people.  Really, wasn't the
whole EQ experience alot more frustrating in beta?
   Heck, I don't know even know if I'm going to play EQ2 or
not.  I'll probably wait for others to report back on it
after it comes out in general release.  I doubt that EQ is
going to go poof anytime soon after the release of EQ2.

Annie  <--- Will probably be saying the same sort of things
about EQ2 when EQ3 rolls around.
