It's ALT+K, but it doesn't work.  In fact, for a while I had two
characters that would crash every time I hit the Enter World button.
After doing some investigating, I found out that I couldn't open the MP3
player on any of my other characters, so I removed the MusicPlayer
section (whatever it's named) from those two characters' .ini files and
I can play them now, but I still can't open the music player on any of
my characters.
