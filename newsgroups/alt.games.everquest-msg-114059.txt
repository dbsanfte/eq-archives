Yes, I've always wondered:  Why do people DO that?  Someone shouts "ding",
there's a half-hearted chorus of "'grats!", and then everything goes back to
normal...  But why?  Surely levelling is something that everyone's done,
everyone but the top level still has to do, and something which is, quite
frankly a royal pain in the arse any time after about level 4 because it
takes for ever and a day, and surely the only thing "ding!" makes a person
want to do is hunt down the dinger, seize them about the throat and throttle
the excessively-cheerful daylights out of them until they go blue in the
face, and point out that, while the dinger him- or herself might well be
enjoying their rocket-like advancement through the levels, some of us are
finding it far harder going thank you very much because all the decent sites
are camped 24/7 and the only things to be found anywhere else are bloody
fire beetles and assorted green riffraff, and pretty much anything in
higher-level zones is sparkly shiny red, and would they, the dinger, kindly
belt up and stop rubbing our own lack of progress in our faces like some
sort of obliviously happy taunting machine before we come to truly regret
the inability to beat hell out of another PC without their permission and
take it out on our pets or loved ones at home.

:breaths deeply.

Argh.
