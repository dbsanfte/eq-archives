Simple, John. From the same website as listed.


equate

v 1: consider or describe as similar, equal, or analogous; "We can compare 
the Han dynasty to the Romans" [syn: compare, liken] 2: be equivalent or 
parallel, in mathematics [syn: correspond]

You didn't go far enough down the page.

compare

n : qualities that are comparable; "no comparison between the two books"; 
"beyond compare" [syn: comparison, equivalence, comparability] v 1: examine 
and note the similarities or differences of; "John compared his haircut to 
his friend's"; "We compared notes after we had both seen the movie" 2: be 
comparable; "This car does not compare with our line of Mercedes" 3: 
consider or describe as similar, equal, or analogous; "We can compare the 
Han dynasty to the Romans" [syn: liken, equate] 4: to form the comparative 
or superlative form on an adjective or adverb

In relation to this thread, John the words were used correctly as I was 
saying that it would be unfair to compare the two countries as they do not 
equate. Or under #3 of the definition you provided, you cannot consider, 
treat, or depict as equal or equivalent the two countries situations, as 
they are not equal.
