Charm is rolled against MR every tick.  You'll find if you use one of those
useless Tash spells on the mob before you Charm it, it'll stay Charmed much,
much longer.  If you're grouping with a druid or ranger, have them Snare the
mob after you Tash but before you Charm - this is known as a 'leash.'
Leashing a Charmed mob means that when the Charm breaks, you run back a bit,
re-Tash, hopefully re-Snare and re-Charm.  Zero sweat, since you're not
standing right next to the fight anyway.  If your charisma is over 150,
there's no point in taking it any higher unless you can get it over 225 - so
don't bother.  Keep the charisma up for when you're using the Lull line to
get single-pulls - charisma is what lets you have a Lull get resisted and
not aggro the target.
