 I'll agree with that. Luclin taken as a whole can be seen as a flop.
Seriously the worst expansion ever. I'd say that mostly had to do with
introducing another race and gearing the zones to support their
leveling. It worked well for Kunark but not so for Luclin. Most of the
exspansion wasn't used by anyone other than newbie Beastlords other than
running through to get to the few useful zones.

 The problem with Seru, and to the same extent Acrylia, is that they are
dead-end encounters and generally seen as not worth the time to defeat.
Ssra gets you into VT the other two zones don't. Of course one could say
AoW is a dead-end encounter as well. But as least you don't have to farm
lame bane weapons/keys. If Verant wanted to make each path worthwhile
(Ssra/Seru/Inner Acrylia) they would have, or should have, made VT power
sources drop in all three encounters. Seru should also get a few more
mini-bosses like Ssra.
