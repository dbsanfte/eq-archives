I have heard that at least for a while, the /random number was
generated client-side, and then transmitted to the server to
be reported to everyone else within earshot.

And that some people had hacked their clients so that they
would always "roll" a 99/100, or whatever they wanted to be
their "fixed" roll (and/or used a "packet pusher" to inform
the server that they "had" rolled a 99/100, despite not
having actually done any rolling in the client).

I don't know if /random was ever patched to be done server-side,
but lacking any verification from Verant on the matter, it's
better to be safe and remove any lingering doubt by asking
people to roll to a specially-chosen number for each new roll
on a highly desired item.  This will foil anyone who has a
"prepackaged good roll" ready to send to the server (and it's
hard to create custom cheat-rolls on the fly, because you can't
access any cheat-program while Everquest has total control of
your computer -- it'd be a different story if EQ could be
run in a window, with a cheat-program "control panel" available
for interaction at the same time).
