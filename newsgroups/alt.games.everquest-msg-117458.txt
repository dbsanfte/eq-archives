Something had to be done. The problem with the Ghoulbane quest mobs was
that they were all placed in very inappropriate places, and were too
tempting as xp targets. The crazed goblins were just one example, where
lazy players could camp/farm a mob that was WAAAAY too high level for
the newbie areas it got stuck in. That way, the lazy player can hunt
them without worrying about any other local fauna in the zone. 

The skellies in Najena were the same way. I took the "lazy route" long
ago and solo'd my warrior through level 35 in Najena just to prove it
could be done. Those skellies were the only thing that would aggro on
me, so I could fight and bandage and sit at my leisure.

/agree Taras
Funniest thing I've seen in ages. "This game sucks and only an idiot
would buy anything from Sony/VI. By the way, can you help me with the
Crazed Goblin situation?"
