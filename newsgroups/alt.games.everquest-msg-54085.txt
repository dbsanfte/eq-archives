Satellite is more for people who are going to use the net for what it
is designed for such as getting email sometimes, looking at websites
sometimes and downloading some upgrades or programs here and there.
All of that basically comes under fairly rapid and short information
exchanges.. not activities which demand sustained very well connected
highly sensitive connections such as when you don't want to die in an
mmorg. 

Its not good though for games at all since they are the most in need
of not only low pings, but steady non fluctuating connections. You are
never on a web page and the web page suddenly crashes because you had
an internet fluctuation, it is still just sitting there and you
probably won't even know anything happened.
