I have a question that is semi related to this but also to DoT's I have
noticed I get less experience from a kill (with both my necro and
druid), if I get the message mob_01 died.  In other words it died to the

dot? It's harder to tell with dot's who's doing more damage, and i don't
tap all that much so i am probably losing out ot my pet on several
fights, so i suppose i should work on doing some more damage, but....
