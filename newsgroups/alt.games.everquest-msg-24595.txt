 You can still do Fear/Hate at that level. You just leave Cazic and Inny
alone. The loot the used to drop now drops off the lower boss-type mobs
such as the Golems in Fear. So you don't really lose anything by not
being able to kill Cazic/Inny.

 Well, that was true before Kunark anyway.

 There are many encounters one can do before 58 so I'm not sure how you
can say the game is designed for levels 58-60. I think overall EQ is
pretty well designed for all levels.
