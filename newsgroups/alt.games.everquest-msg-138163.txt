    The Faith Stone is made with pottery skill - you'd have one made for
your particular religion (they are religion specific, and CLR and/or SHM
only). It has right-click teleport to your "home temple". In my case, it
drops me at the cleric's guild in Kaladim. There's my port back to old
world. The Prelate's Rubicite Helm drops in Cazic Thule, is tradeable, and
has right-click Root (4.5 secs cast time) on it. The Hammer of the Sun has
right-click Dawncall, which now that I think about it might be an
anti-undead nuke and not an anti-undead DoT. But whatever - you see the
basis here. Ability to re-root at will, right-clickable damage to supplement
normal damage from stuff like Epitaph of Life and Exile Undead/Judgement,
and two items that bring you to full mana again in an awful hurry.
