I dunno about that.  I myself only play the single-player games.  I loved
Starcraft; Warcraft never really drew me in.  But that's another matter.  =)

I think you'd be surprised at the number of people who play these games only
as single-player and never touch the online stuff.  They want to play the
game for its story, and for the tactics, and the graphics, and the rest, and
have no interest in playing against some fourteen-year-old online who will
shout "I PWNED U!!1!" as his zerglings destroy your base.

Speaking for myself, one online obsession is enough.  =)  And yet I'll still
buy the occasional RTS game like Homeworld just for the variety of it, but
I'll never even consider playing it online.  And I think I'm far from alone
in that sentiment.
