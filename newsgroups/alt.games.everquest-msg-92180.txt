never go half-ased on a video card purchase if you can help it.  My
suggestions would be teh GeForce 3 Ti200 at the least.  Should be around
$150 now in places if not less.

I use it for Luclin and the only place it does chug is luclin itself, but I
think that's a game issue, not a system/graphics card issue.  all other
zones run fine.  full detail, all models, yadda yadda yadda.
