Assuming they're adequately leveled and adequately equipped
because the game is tuned for that level of encounter, why not?
What logic is there in sending 60 people, for instance, instead
of 12?  How much "epic" fiction involves 60 characters who all
are vital in the final showdown?

The problem with EQ's model as it sits is the "tune the fight
for 12 and we'll send 18 (or 24 or 30 or more) and trivialize
the fight" mentality.  That forces the designers to design
encounters for the maximum force you can get before diminishing
returns kick in (lag, zone crashes, etc.)

There are ways around that which aren't used in the current model.
An NPC who gives a quest and teleports a maximum number of people
on a 'raid' to a 'private' zone, for instance.  That zone
wouldn't require as much in the way of resources as a full zone
and players would be unable to trivialize the encounter by sending
more people.

If, instead of throwing 40 people at Tormax, wouldn't it be better
to have a raid of 12 (or even just a group), be able to kill a
keyholder who drops a key that, when used, teleports your group(s)
to the castle where you deal with two or four guards and then King
Tormax?  Isn't that what people thought they'd be doing (small,
"epic" encounters with beasties) when they bought EQ?

Small zones, with key portals activated by NO DROP, NO RENT,
timed use keys ("this key will self-destruct in one minute")
would eliminate the zerg tactics currently in the game.  And, IMO,
it'd be a lot better for it.  And, IIRC, it's one of the rumors
floating around about PoP, too.

Side note:  AL, FoH, etc are *all* zerg guilds because the game
is built with a high-end that *requires* zerg tactics.  You can't
win with small, balanced groups.  You have to zerg the mob with a
high number of players.  They don't have to zerg lower tier
encounters just like the lowest tier guilds doesn't have to zerg
orc camp 1 in EC.  But, at the top end, it's still zerg tactics.
