Rogue: sometimes.
Necro: never.

I have taken both on raids.  The rogue, well, he has been on some
raids where, since he's the damage dealer, he dies. A LOT.  I've lost
nearly a level of exp at a raid.  I've gained nearly a level of exp at
another raid.  The necro, well, she's in the back.  She doesn't get
the xp as often but neither does she lose it as often.  It all works
out.

Thanks for the generalization, skippy.  In my experience, it's selfish
poeple that whine about the fact that they're not getting anything out
of a raid.

Lower Guk: Taellaar.  Didn't get much exp out of it, did win a light
burplap sack, which was nice.
ToFS: Taellaar died several times, nearly lost a level, didn't win any
loot.
Dalnir: Taellaar got a kick-ass amount of xp, won a sarnak emblazoned
talbert for an alt, got exactly the same amount of cash that everybody
else did at the raid.
Gorge of King Xorbb: Nova got some exp due to the fact that it's a
one-group type of raid, but most of the stuff we were fighting was
green - it was a raid to get some nice equipment for low levels in the
guild, and get some ore and clay for the potters and smithers in the
guild.  Left that raid in disgust because a brand new guildie was
bitching about the lack of exp even though we were barely surviving
*greens* fer cripe's sake, and refused to take anything because
another guildie accused me of leaving with all the items when I
hadn't, without bothering to find out first.  BUT - the only loot I
would have been interested in from that raid was clay, and I can get
that myself if I really need to.  I already have a PBB on one arm,
don't need one on the other arm, PBHs? I already have a batskull
earring.
Mistmoore, I didn't get to go to at the last minute, and hadn't
decided who I was taking.  If Taellaar, the only drop I would have
been interested in was the blood spirits for his burning rapier quest,
even if he is getting a bit old for it now.  If Nova, I would have
been interested in the nightshade wreath.  The blood spirits I would
most likely get without question, as I'm usually the only rogue along.
The wreath I'd have to roll on like everybody else in the group.  Exp
wise, I hear it was a messy raid, so once again, actually gaining exp
would have been a pleasant surprise.

NOW I get exp with Nova, NOW I lose exp with Taellaar.  Whoop de shit.
Doesn't affect me.  Nova still goes on raids, Taellaar still goes on
raids.  Because my guild asks me too, and I know that one day I'll
have the favor returned - hopefully by people who are now skilled
enough at raids that we'll live through an actual high level
encounter.

Raids.are.NOT.for.exp.  OR for loot.  I'm going to learn how to work
with other people.  I'm going to have a good time with my friends.
Live or die, wipe or not, I'm there, and I'm there for as long as I
possibly can be.  Because raids are not for ME.

But now, if you REALLY want some, voila, there you go, you got it.  So
shut up and quit whining.

Ryou
(sincerely)
