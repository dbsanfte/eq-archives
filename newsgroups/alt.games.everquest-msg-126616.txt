That may be so, but I am not sure that the
kamikaze are an example of this. It may depend on
the way you define religion. Doesn't religion come
down to a sense of duty?

Buddhism and Shintoism were great influences on
the samurai, and therefore bushido.

There is no doubt that the defence forces of Japan
looked to the samurai and bushido for their
inspiration, and through this, found the will to
become kamikaze.
