I expect that the delay has more to do with the Bazaar zone itself.
It's just *way* too small for the number of people who would want to
use it.

I did a little parsing of my last 4 hours in ECBay and came up with
571 people stopping in to auction in that time. Now, imagine them all
in the bazaar overnight with the person afk. Now, imagine trying to
buy a horse...

It is to shudder.
