Yeah, I'll probably HAVE to return to LGuk, as the ranja wants his
FBSS bad, and I'd like to get that resist crown off the king, and
KC is always good for a cleric. The othmir will live in peace for
me tho', otters are kayooot! And CoM, hmmf, I've raided a lot there
and getting a bit bored with it. Thanks though!

Rune, who won't kill othmir or burynai. Awww, kayooot!
