This type of "emergency" patching should be as common as the patching itself
right?  lol.. I mean.. really.

One thing I noticed about the spell stacking "fix" is that if a level 29
used his ensnare spell on a mob, a level 49 could not use his ensnare on
that very same mob after the level 29 used his.  I'm sure this -may- be
insignificant, but, I've also noticed that a lower level (1 level less than
myself) somehow ensnared a mob after I did, removing my ensnare, which could
be a bad situation and essentially was since I couldn't re-ensnare the mob
once he used his.  If I confused anyone as to what is happening, dont be
concerned because I just confused myself.  I suppose in short I could say,
they messed up the spell stacking "fix."... <grin>
