I can't say that anyone mentioned in the original post is my favorite, nor
can I say that GetsumJ is my favorite.  That said, Bizbee, mental illness is
a disease.  There is a huge stigma associated with it, and yet those who
have a mental illness have done nothing wrong but to have a chemical
imbalance in their brain.

It took 5 years of misdiagnosis before a doctor finally asked the question,
"Could this be organic?"  Turns out I was diagnosed with everything under
the sun except for depression that was caused by a hyper-thyroid.

Mental illiness is a serious thing.  I saw quite a few people who are
mentally ill and yet functioning on a day to day basis, and Bizbee calling
GetsumJ a poster child for mental illness is an insult to everyone out there
who is seeking treatment.

Once again, the maturity level of this entire news group amazes me.  But for
a few people, most of the posters are mature, knowledged and wanting to
help.

I guess it's time to use the old KF'er.  Hate plonking people, but hate
ignorance and immaturity even more.
