Actually, Forlorn Deeds is classified as detrimental, but, it does not do 
damage, which is another limit on affliction haste.  Another 
consideration, if availability of spell haste IV is an issue, Forlorn 
Deeds is a level 57 spell, and thus only requires spell haste III.  Mind 
you the SH IV item would be better as it will work on all the spells that 
SHIII works on, plus your 61 to 65 spells.
