Heheheh, agreed, yet I don't look a gift jeweler in the mouth, silver
or not.  The silver Items i have were gifts if you will, from a Guild
jeweler.  He's working on his skill to go beyond... but not there yet.

 What exactly is this bracer you mention... bracer of the reverent?..
I tried to search for gold bracers for clerics on Allakahzam..with no
hits then a search for bracers and cleric,  and this is the one that
came up.

Actually yes,  Auto split is my main source of cash... as of now I
have a grand total of 400 Plat to my name...  Again a mention of the
Gold Quest... I am unable to locate that one (not saying it isn't out
there, just unable to find the reference to Cleric Gold quest)

Thanks again for your time
