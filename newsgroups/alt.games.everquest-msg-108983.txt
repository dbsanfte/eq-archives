     As with any quest, it's not enough to just have matching graphics.
If it calls for a Greater Lightstone, nothing else will do.

     The Concordance of Research is a quest reward for turning in a
Greater Lightstone...but you might not need one.  This quest is
frequently
done by low-level chars just for the experience and money, and they sell
the Concordance right back to the vendor for even more money, so you can
probably go to her with just plat and buy one "over the counter".

     Normal Lightstones can be turned in to get a readable book at
random
which contains some of the recipes for making practice runes with the
Concordance.  You don't need to do this if you can look them up on the
web.

     Don't feel bad about putting all or most of your practice points
into Research, especially if you've been hoarding.  Whatever you don't
spend on activating new skills should be spent on whatever's hardest to
raise through use, and Research is one of the worst.

     The most efficient way to spend practice points on Research is to
wait
until level 20 or 24.  If you start at 16, 17, 18, or 19, you will be
able to
put one point in, period, and have to wait until level 20 to put in
more.
(Research has a per-level cap of 5 * [level - 15].  Your first point
will
raise your skill directly to your character level, even if that's over
the
cap, but you can't spend more points or get natural improvements until
your
cap is above what your skill is.)

     If you absolutely have to have a research-only spell at level 16,
put
one point into the skill, put the words into your book, and click
Combine.
You can't get any better chances than that and you can't improve until
20,
so don't bother with training or runes or anything.

     There's one book that makes spells for each of the four pure
INT-caster
classes, plus the Concordance of Research.  That's five.  The
Concordance is
a quest reward.  The other four are sold by vendors near the appropriate
class's guildmasters.  (These same vendors also sell quills and
parchment,
which are used in all practice rune recipes.)

     If you go the Practice Point route, which I recommend, the only
book
you'll need is the one that makes spells for your class.  You can buy
and
use the other three if you want to make spells for the other classes to
give to friends or guildmates or to try to sell.  The book, not the
class
of the researcher, determined what spells it makes, and researchers are
not restricted to using only their own books.

     The Concordance is only good for making practice runes.  Each
practice
rune requires five ingredients:  a quill, a parchment, and three other
items
that vary with the rune.  Each combination always produces a rune and
gives
you the quill back.  There are sixteen different practice rune recipes,
in
eight pairs of increasing difficulty.  Making practice runes in the
Concordance does not raise Research...that's done by taking the practice
runes in matched pairs and combining them in any of the spell-making
books
as if you're trying to make a spell out of them.

> What ingredients should I start saving?

     With your practice points, don't bother with research ingredients.
Write down the words you need for the next few research-only spells you
want and keep an eye out for those.
