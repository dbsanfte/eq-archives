You dont' always get an email stating you are in.  I've been in several 
betas for Sony.  One way to find out is to try to log in the beta forum, if 
you can find the URL for it.  I recall someone posted a link to that forum 
a few days ago.  Another way to find out is to go to the test server and 
see if there's another server there besides the main test one (that's how I 
found out I was in the Discord beta).
