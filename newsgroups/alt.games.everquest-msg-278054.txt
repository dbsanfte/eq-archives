Maybe Velium Hound Furs was not the best example,cause its used
in Prayer Shawl quest,the furs I sold were left overs from doing the
quest.
But there are still *flawless* hopper hides,as far as I know only good
for raising tailoring,these sell for 300p to 500p,and are very easy to
come by (for my 67 Ranger),if I really wanted to make plat.

I know a player,who started half a year ago,he is playing the bazaar
game mostly,a quick browse through his trader comes up with stuff
for around 2 millions.
I think it depends how you play,I am not very concerned about plat,
usually I pass on Ldon named drops,if I dont need them for an alt or
know a friend who would like it.
Usually I have around 50k cash sitting in the bank,most of it coming
from Halas meat pie and Grobb Liquidized Meat,sometimes I make
cash from OoW drops,especially runes,but thats rare.
Other nice source of income is Natimbi,hunting there for 20 AAs with
a 55 Ranger I found several of the necklaces which sell for 20 or 30k.
But I like all my chars nicely equipped,so mostly I spent money I made
pretty fast on stuff I cant get myself or with only 1 group like
Ornate armour,of which has the 55 Rng several pieces,among them
Tunic and Leggings,pretty costly.

Browsing through my 3 Mains(67Rng,55Rng,65Cle) I find around 
items bought for around 500k on them and rarely did pure plat
hunting in my 5 years EQ.
So I would think,if I  had been more concerned about plat all this
time,I easily would have several millions.
