You mean for the WoW part or the EQ2 part?  For the WoW part, I'll have to
ask the person who told me for an exact cite.  He got it on the official
forums somewhere.

For the EQ2 part, it's in the message that appears in the chat window when
we login to Anotonia Bayle.  Someone told me that this is on some other
servers, too, all going to the same new server.
