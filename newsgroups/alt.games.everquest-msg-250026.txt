Outside of these two, here are my suggestions (not that anyone asked or
cares)

- Random XP bonus
       - "You just killed the Spiderling King's favorite nephew, triple
Experience!!!"

- Random Gold bonus
        - "You just killed the Level 5 Bixie Payroll Clerk, 10pp"

- Random Loot bonus
        - "You just killed a Grizzly Bear, he was carrying a Handmade
Backpack in his mouth"

- Random Recipe bonus
        - "You just killed the Drachnid Master Tailor, you learned the
Drachnid Silk Robe Recipe"

- Random Quest bonus
        - "You just killed the Goblin Thief, you learned the Quest of the
Lost Veil"

These could be "One in a Thousand Kills" type things

There could even be "One in Ten Thousand Kills" items, just something
completely out of the blue, things normally not found on certain mobs or in
specific zones.  Something a lvl 5 or lvl 45 could get excited about.

Think how cool it would be to learn a tradeskill combine and have it 50
points below a normal combine from now on.

Or finding something like a 20 Dose Blood of the Wolf.

What about an 50 AC shield or +5 Mana Regen Ring that is good for one month.

Always having to go to certain zones, kill certain mobs in a certain order
sucks.

I want something that will make me go "Woot!" in RL so loud my neighbors
complain.

That's my 2cp
