Speaking of sounds, maybe I'm just a cowardly Paladin but when I hear
*THUMP* *THUMP* *CRUNCH* *THUMP* I immediately yell "HIDE!" and run off
to the nearest tree, peeking around for the Hill Giant. Those things
have put a deadly fear into me. I don't come back out from behind the
tree until I get a visual and see him disappear over the horizon. Does
having a form of illumination, i.e. a Wisp's Light (whatever it's
called), a Fire Beetle Eye, torch, etc. increase your visibility to
mobs? And what's the time relationship in the game? How long does a game
hour last in real time, and what time is sunset and sunrise? And,
finally, I ported into the Druid ring at N. Karana last night only to
find myself standing next to a 60' tree. It was a freakin' Treant, and
the first time I ever saw it. I was amazed by it and then it started
moving. I don't think Treebeard was that tall.
