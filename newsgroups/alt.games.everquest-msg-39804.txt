FYI

Iksars should never have to use the ladders to get out of the water. If you
swim right up to the wall and look up while swimming you will jump out and
onto the ledge. It gets easier and you can do it to higher edges as your
swimming skill gets better. With SoW on I have actually jumped up on top of
the Cabilis bank from the water.
