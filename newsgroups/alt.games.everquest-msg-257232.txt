Any magicians out there that can give some advice on this part of the epic?

We've camped Najena on and off for a couple days now, killing all DE mages 
- looking for the torn pages.  If I read correctly, I think the magicians 
that will actually drop the pages are in Najena's room (gold crecent key 
access).  Obviously, we haven't had any good luck.

Any tips to acquiring these ellusive pages?  Are we on the right track?  
CastersRealm also said they dropped in Feerrott.  I haven't seen any DE 
mages there.

Any help would be appreciated.

M
