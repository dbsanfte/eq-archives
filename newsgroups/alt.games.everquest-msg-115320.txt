I've seen several posts asking about EQ on a Laptop.  I recently replaced my
old laptop, and the new one runs EQ like a charm.  I installed Trilogy
first...worked great.  Then the true test, installed Luclin, still works
great with all char models enabled.  I haven't been up to Luclin yet on it,
but other laggy zones (EC, LOIO, Oasis, etc) seem to work fine.

I've tried it physically plugged into the lan, wireless lan card, and dial
up with the modem.  Definately a good EQ on the road machine (no, not it's
primary function...or is it?)

Here's the specs.

Toshiba Satellite 5005-S504
 Intel� Pentium� III processor 1.1GHz
15" TFT active matrix display
512MB SDRAM
GeForce II Go Video with 16mb DDR
DVD/CD-RW multifunction drive
30GB1 Hard drive
Yamaha Sound System featuring harman/kardon� Stereo Speakers with subwoofer
10/100 Ethernet
V.90/56K modem
Smart Media Slot
SD Media Slot
2 PCMCIA slots
External USB Floppy Drive
I.R. Port
TV Out (NTSC/PAL Output)
Windows XP Home

Hope this helps for anyone else out there looking for a new EQ capable
laptop.
