I'd say Christopher was more like an editor for The Silmarillion than a
co-author.  It was a daunting task, but he did pretty well.  I don't think
there was very much of his own writing in there... only a couple of
inconsistencies that he corrected, I believe.

Christopher did an excellent job with the "History of Middle Earth" series,
IMHO.  But that wasn't as story teller, more as documentarian (is that a
word?).
