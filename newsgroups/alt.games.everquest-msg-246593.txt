My roomie and I had a language training party other night and noticed 
something we both find kinda buggy but cool.

One of his characters learned us a lot of languages just to skill point 1.

Then our lowbies started chanting different languages, and the fun part is 
even with 1 skillpoint in language we could train ourselves up to 100.

Actually it means whatever crappy you are at a language you can always 
improve it by talking to yourself, or speaking crappy to others.

Hmmm wish RL worked that way, then I could do better french.
