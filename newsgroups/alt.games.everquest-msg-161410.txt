No longer true.  In fact, I have not had opportunity to verify the
"two casters using same DoT" that they intended to allow, but I can
tell you that both of the "swarm" DoTs and both of the fire-based
DoTs that my 30 Druid has can be stuck on the same mob at the same
time.  There is no overwriting or bouncing, you get both "has worn
off" messages at the right time, and in the case of Stinging Swarm
plus Creeping Crud it is very obvious that the mob is taking damage
from both spells.  I'm just trying to make it to my next DoT so I can
pile on 5 at a time before they finally get around to fixing this to
work as they announced it.  I imagine there'll be the usually wailing
about it being a "nerf", but I just figure it's a temporary bonus.
Your necro might can do the same with poisons and diseases.  :)
