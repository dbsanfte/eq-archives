    I really feel for rangers on this one, and hope it gets fixed soon
(assuming it isn't considered a stacking exploit by VI). We had one raid
where a ranger logged after just exploding in /gu. We found out later that a
paladin had decided to have some fun with the ranger, and alternated casting
Brell's on him with standing in front of him to stop his arrows. We weren't
impressed with the paladin.
