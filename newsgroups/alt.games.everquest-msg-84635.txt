OK, fun topic here.  There are certain characters that just look cooler 
than others of course, but there are a very select few characters who 
through a combination of choice and luck just end up looking like true 
badasses.  On the Innoruuk server there are a couple striking characters, 
mostly in LoD or the few remaining members of The Pantheon, but the 
absolutely best looking character is a level 56 dark elf cleric named 
Meadbh the Malevolent.  I've known here off and on for probably 4 months, 
and have grouped with her in exp situations, in raids with her guild, and 
in raids with my guild.  
First, she's a dark elf, and I think they are the most striking of the new 
female models, especially with the bangs hanging across the forehead.  The 
really striking thing though is that she looks almost exacltly like an SK, 
with a big shield and a huge, gnarled 1hb weapon.  I mentioned that she 
looked more like an SK than a cleric one day, and she replied that she is 
part SK.  I wasn't sure what she meant, but she explained that her title 
was awared in a GM event, and her weapon had a DoT lifetap companant.  The 
weapon is Malevolence

I've looked all over, and can't find a screenshot of her, so I'll try and 
snap one this weekend.  
Anyway, no real point to this topic, but I'm hoping that others will post 
links to truly striking characters.
