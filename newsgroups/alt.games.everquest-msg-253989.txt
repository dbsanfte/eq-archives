Why, it's as plain as the nose on your face!  Adopting that
insanity would put hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of
tax accountants and lawyers out of work!
/sarcasm

Actually the only incredible stupidity I noted was the opening
"Everybody agrees...", which is always a great big red flag:
Warning:  Groupthink in progress!
Danger! Danger!  Penny Robinson return to the ship!

It's a helluva lot more sensible way to tax economic activity
than our current overly complex scheme of individual and
corporate income taxes.  But those guys realy ought to fix
their presentation if they want to get past the "kooks on the
margin" stage of public perception.
