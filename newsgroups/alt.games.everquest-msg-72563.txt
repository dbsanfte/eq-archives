Nope.  Poorly spelled and formated messages take more effort to read.
Your original post seemed to be asking for help with some problem, but
in the quick skimming a gave it, I couldn't tell precisely what you
wanted.  A well spelled and formatted post would not have had that
problem.

Since I'm reading this group for fun, not as a paid customer support
person, posts like your original one simply get skipped.
