I would like to add my 2 copper....

FV is a great place! I have only been playing EQ for a couple of months, and
I started out on one of the non-roleplaying servers. One of the problems (or
annoying habits) I have found on other servers (I have been experimenting
with different characters on different servers) is the constant Shouts and
OOC chat. Maybe I have been in the wrong place at the wrong time, but manyof
the servers I have tried this seems to be standard....not on FV.

Many things are zone specific and /ooc is gone on FV. This really helps the
roleplaying. Plus, many players are /roleplay which makes them /anon and
forces even more roleplaying. Add the lack of 'twinked" players and it
nearly forces you to become your character.

As an ex-D&D gamer, I have found my home on FV and would recommend it to
anyone.
