You're talking about an un-annotated version meant for laypeople and yeah,
that could probably fit in one volume. The actual California Vehicle Code
that a lawyer would consult spans a few volumes because lawyers use books
that contain caselaw citations for virtually every significant portion of
text, and then multiple volumes of supplements that are updated very
regularly (some of them daily). That's why law libraries are so damned
expensive. Fortunately, a lot of this stuff has moved online recently.
Hmmph, there wasn't any such thing as "online" when I practiced law. When I
was a young lawyer we walked 50 miles uphill to the courthouse both ways,
and WE LIKED IT!

I remember having a discussion with my youngest daughter in which I
described the notion of a typewriter. She thought it was a pretty cool idea
to have a keyboard with a built-in printer.
