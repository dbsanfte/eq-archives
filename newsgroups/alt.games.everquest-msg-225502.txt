See, at those levels, you're leeching more than just flags in that
situation.   Rogue DPS against deep red targets is nothing to write home
about.  In effect, they were powerleveling you. Which is fine, if it's a
group of friends and they're all agreeable to the situation... but, at least
for me, I'm very uncomfortable in any group where I feel I can't pull my own
weight.   Level 55's that pop into PoV the moment they ding that level and
shouting for groups really strike me as being kind of cheeky.   With very
rare exceptions (cleric only for the most part) those 55's aren't going to
make any meaningful contribution to a group they join there.

I've talked in serverwide.age a bit about one particular case which I find
somewhat sad, somewhat irritating, and somewhat amusing all at the same
time.   On our server, there is a level 61 warrior who did they key quest to
get into Bastion of Thunder.   And in BoT, he sits there, shouting "level 61
warrior LFG" for days on end.  I've never seen him actually get a group...
but he's always there trying.  Even to the point of arguing with the zone if
/ when someone suggests that he might have better luck elsewhere.  And in
reality... the warrior is somewhat correct when he says he can tank there.
A level 61 warrior tanking 62-64 giants is workable...  but why on earth
would any group go for that when there are level 65 warriors (and level 65
knights for that matter) sitting next to him also looking for group.   So if
he's not needed to tank, then he's competing for a dps slot... and even the
best equipped level 61 warrior will be completely "owned" damagewise by a
"just dinged 62 so they can enter" rogue in BoT.

The sad part is that if he went somewhere like PoV, he would be a god.
Well, ok, maybe not really, he's still a warrior instead of a knight... but
still he would get instant and constant group action.   For the amount of
time I've personally seen him LFG...  he would have been 64 at a minimum by
now.  But instead he just sits in BoT, waiting for some group to pick him
up, and the "best exp available" to roll in for him.     But then, I guess
you can't really expect brilliant rational decisions from someone who chose
to name thier character "Gooberdude."

Sounds to me like it was more a problem of "not enough to kill" than "not
enough per kill."   A high ZEM does nothing if you're sitting there full
mana waiting on respawns.

(And even if you were making more exp per hour there... I would still pick
another zone, due to the boredom factor.)
