A concept you just don't get, since you jump through all sorts of
hoops to excuse all sorts of terrorism.

Then why on Earth can't *YOU* accept your own advice. That is
exactly what you and the other apologists for Israel do.

So if you support the Israeli Terrorism, then you by default MUST
support the 9/11 attacks and all other terrorism.

The first people arrested in connection with the WTC attacks
were 3 men apparently celebrating the attacks in Liberty State
Park. Turns out these people worked for a company called
"Urban Moving Systems", were Israeli nationals and illegaly
in the US. 

> It's logic...  pure and simple...

A concept you appear completly unable to understand.
