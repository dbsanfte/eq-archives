Nope, because real life isn't a game that I play to relax.  If you
can't see the difference and why a parallel doesn't work between what I
was saying and your example, it will be impossible to have a
conversation.

On Earth, it is possible to spend a day in China, then the next day
spend it in the Alps.  Of course, that is assuming you have 24 hours in
a day to travel.  In a game, I suppose you could have 24 hours to
travel if you 1) don't do anything except play that game, or 2) have a
system that lets you travel while you aren't actively playing.

Time constraints are a big part of why I don't see how people can
equate time sinks (or what I refer to as frustration) to immersion.
Why play a game that is frustrating, when the goal of a game is to have
fun?  Errr, I guess the goal is to have fun for most people, you always
have some people that are happier when they are miserable ;)
