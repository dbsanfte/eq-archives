So you were stealing experience from hard-working players, removing them ALL
possibility to "good loot?" just to twink???

Damn, are you selfish or what?  PL them somewhere that isn't STEALING from
legit players.  Even with non-PLers in there, that zone is way overcrowded
with 24 people in it.  Before you get your panties in a bind I've PLed many
characters...want my list of GOOD, NON-SELFISH places to take them?

At their present level:
- Anywhere folks aren't, in Warrens
- one of the SRo derv camps
- Some of Upper Guk
- Paludal - no direct knowledge but the thought of all those critters
totally being ignored by the 3 people in the zone make my mouth water.

At level 20-30:
- SolA starting near the entrance at 20, pretty much anywhere at 30
- UGuk - didn't PL here, but I know there's lots to do.

In answer to your question, the person who engages a critter first OWNS it,
and your complaint about kill stealing will be ignored by the CS people,
especially since you shouldn't be in that zone anyway.
