If you do a quick google search on Bush Wicca, you will find lots of hits
regarding this.  Here is a copy of one.

Question: With religious diversity increasing, what are your thoughts on the
protection of religious freedom and the separation of church and state?
Should religions like Wicca be banned from recognition by the military, as
some legislators suggest?

Answer from George W. Bush:
Religious Freedom And Tolerance Is A Protected Right
I am committed to the First Amendment principles of religious freedom,
tolerance, and diversity.

Whether Mormon, Methodist, Jewish, or Muslim, Americans should be able to
participate in their constitutional free exercise of religion. I do not
think witchcraft is a religion, and I do not think it is in any way
appropriate for the U.S. military to promote it.
