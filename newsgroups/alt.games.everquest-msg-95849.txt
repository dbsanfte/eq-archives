 Overall I prefer most of the new models. However I have them turned off
since the game loads, zones and runs much better with the old models
(for me).

 Irrelevant but true. If I could play fine with the new models I'd
probably have them all on and they'd grow on me and I'd start to like
them more. Heck, I don't even have horses on.

 So I guess my answer is NO. It affects my gameplay therefore I prefer
the older models. I can't base my answer on pure aesthetics since I feel
more things are relevant than that.
