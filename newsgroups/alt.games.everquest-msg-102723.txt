In an auction heavy zone, like EC on my server, it becomes completely
impossible to read auctions if idiots are spamming like that.  There are
also the idiots who feel that their auction is so important that it has to
be repeated every 2 seconds.  Personally I avoid EC like the plague that it
is, the longest I have spent there trying to buy/sell is about 10 minutes,
after that I had to go out and kill things.  I don't know the stats on most
items, so I do have problems knowing what items that are for sale might be
useful to me, but, I wouldn't be able to read them anyway if they are
scrolling by at a mile a minute.
