You don't need int. As a wood elf druid the stat that counts is wis,
for your mana and tradeskills and anything else. Forget you have int.
Forget that int is there, don't try to make int higher, ignore int,
from this day foreward you have no int, Int = right out.

Get forest loop earrings. I think players sell them for 250 plat or a
bit more. Many players forget that at max charisma/faction for prices 
you can sell forest loop earrings to a vendor for nearly 300 plat
each. 
Even orc fang are okay until you get the forest loop, people sell them
for maybe 140 plat a pair or less. That is 3 ac and 15 hp each I
think.

Go to a vendor and get leather shoulderpads and a leather belt until
you get something better. Braided ivy cords are like 5 wis druid only
and sell for maybe 100 plat (shoulder slot) Crystilline belt is 3 wis
or so and sells for 300 plat or less.

You can get money by making leather padding, 100 plat per stack of 20.
I get tired of writing all the details so just go to:

www.eqtraders.com 

look in the recipes area and messageboard/tailoring area. Essentially
you can probably buy out a ton o' spiderling silk and hides on
merchants in gfay/felwithe to make padding with. I made 14 stacks of
padding that way.
