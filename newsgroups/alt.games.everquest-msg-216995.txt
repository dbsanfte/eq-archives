Devil's advocate mode on

And why don't we stop those crazy buffs while we're at it?  People should
just slug it out like we did back in my day.  No fancy c this and c that.
Just lots of corpses and learning experiences.  They learn so much more if
they stay on the same level for weeks at a time.

Man, I learned a lot since my first char was on Rallos Zek.  People would
hang around the newbie areas just to help you learn more in each level.
