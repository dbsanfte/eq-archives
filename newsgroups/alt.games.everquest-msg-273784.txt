Innoruk has released his daughter Lanys from exile in Hate.  She is preparing to march
against all the creatures of light, with a particular bent towards a long-awaited rematch
with Tunare's champion, Firiona Vie.

Her first act was to 'recruit' King and Queen Thex of Neriak to her father's cause.  Now
it appears that Lanys is building a host in DL to attack Firiona Vie's namesake city.

Here's a snippet from the very end of storyline/storyLanys.txt, which was the last
addition to the EQ Storyline...

"Aye, don't worry, my friend.  You will be well fed," Lanys said as they left to recruit
and train as many dark elves, trolls and even ogres as they could find with their eye on
amassing in the Overthere.
