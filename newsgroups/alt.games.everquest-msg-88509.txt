Er the tutorial does its job very nicely. It teaches a new player he
general control mechanisms....it was simple for me as a relatively
experience FPS player to pick up the basics and so on, but it was helpful
for certain basic EQ specific issues, mainly the quest trigger bits etc.
FOr a complete novice its extremely useful IMO

FOr someone who has seemingly played the game already (hence reinstall) it
is going to be pointless though.
