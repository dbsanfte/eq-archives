Find and run EQEmu...you can do the same thing now,
and just taking the time to look at some of the zones
without lag, level 94 monsters, and ijits in d00dspake
can really make you appreciate the time and effort
some of the modelers and graphics folks put into the
game.

Until you get to the live game and zone into Great Divide
to hear "Scout Jarjar Binks shouts 'Cannot open file
warning.txt!!!"
;-)
