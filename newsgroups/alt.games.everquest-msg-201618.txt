 And also incorrect. PoT was being fixed from the time Furor made his
post to the time AL started to advance. So the encounters being
complained about by the first guilds in PoT were not the same ones that
are being beat now.

 And it's true. Furor is still playing. FoH recently started some
backflagging so I'm guessing those that quit after the Rathe mess will
be replaced soon enough.

 I'm guessing they don't especially care, really.
