    Stop right here. As a 65 cleric, I'd be ashamed of any cleric I called
friend who didn't res a groupmate, no matter the circumstances. I've even
bitched out a close friend who was going to do that when I was playing my
rogue and he his cleric. It is our job, just as much as healing and buffing.
If someone is being a total prick, leave the group, call them knobs, go all
Quon on them and put them on "The List". But you don't strand them without a
res.

    You're level 51 now? You'll start to see soon exactly how much of your
time an unressed death takes. I'd guesstimate by the mid-50's it would take
four hours of solid XP grinding to get back the loss from an unressed death.
It's not about time lost running back to the body, it's about the time lost
trying to get back to where you were.

> It's a convenience to the character who died, not a requirement.

    I'm a cleric, and I couldn't disagree more with that statement. People
group clerics knowing they will get a res if they die, it is wrong to then
deny them that while still grouped.

    It's your reputation. Some people will hear the whole story about how
you got the jerk of the party back. Some people will only hear that you
refused to offer an XP res to a groupmate. Do you want to chance this,
especially given how group-dependent a class you are?

    This is how I would resolve a case of someone being an asshole, in
general. I say "in general" because I haven't read the original story -
forgive me if this was done. First, try to resolve the situation with tells
to the asshole. Doesn't work? Tell the group that there's an issue, what it
is, and that tells didn't work. Isn't resolved? Tell the group the situation
is unbearable, either the asshole goes or you go, and that you totally
understand if they elect to replace you because the asshole is
irreplaceable.

    Remember, you may be putting the group in a very tough place by saying
you'll leave, and it's not totally fair to them if they aren't the root
cause of the problem. By allowing them an "out" ("We're only replacing you,
Ms. Cleric, because we can't find another ENC"), they're less likely to
remember you as an imperious little so-and-so that ended their night of EQ.
Maybe this isn't true now, but I remember well the days where if I left a
group, they were done for the night. So that's where that attitude comes
from.
