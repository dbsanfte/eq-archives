I've had this happen once with a charmed pet.  It definately wasn't
distance in my case - I moved much closer to make sure.  I had only
just charmed the pet and the pet did follow me around so it wasn't that
it was mezzed or rooted.  When this happened my pet wouldn't attack
anything.  I ended up setting it to guard and running out of range and
then breaking charm.
