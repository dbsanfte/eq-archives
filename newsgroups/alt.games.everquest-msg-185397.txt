No go.  She hates ebay.  I'm not too fond of it myself - hey there's
another thing we have in common.  I think she likes to go shop
physically, although I've cought her looking at coach or dooney & bourk
purses online (damn those things are expensive)

Got two, hers is a bit behind the times though, only a PII 350.  She
occasionaly plays some games, I did see her looking at zoo tycoon the
couple times we went into a game shop so that's probably a good choice.
She'll shop just about anywhere, even go to Fry's or EB with me, she
draws the line at RPG shops, something about all the smelly greesy men
who stare at her the moment she enters I guess.

Well I think I've come to terms with not having her play EQ, but if I
thought I could get her into evercrack I would - mysery loves company.
