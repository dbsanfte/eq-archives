Although it'd make sense for a cat race to have a pure unarmed combat class
like a monk I think they decided against as they have seen the lack of
balance that already exists with other class/race combo's.
Current choice of Human (Slightly better Damage Output and tolerated by all
but evil races making for an easier time travelling) or Iksar (better AC,
Regen, nightvision but hated by pretty much everything on Norrath) sways in
favour of Iksar if you don't mind working on faction, Vah Shir would pretty
much remove the Humans from the choice, with far superior stats and no
faction issues and who wouldn't want to see a 7' bipedal Tiger doing
spinning hook kicks?

If they balance stats in EQ2 (ie make them worth having) then it'd be nice
to see a better mix of class/race.
