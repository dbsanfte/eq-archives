Hmmm, magazine's I read.

Well, my roommate gets a bunch of magazines, one of which is Rolling 
Stone. I read it, but it's really not much of a magazine anymore. The 
quality of production is pretty low... but then again, they're trying to 
appeal to 18-24 year old males... most of us have pretty low 
expectations... I don't (I'm an 18 year old male.)

I used to get Videomaker, a consumer level video magazine, but I 
gradually outgrew it, and at the same time, the magazine got dumbed down, 
which made it even less entertaining. I still pull out back issues from 
time to time and read them, but the newer ones are not nearly as good.

I read PC Magazine when I'm at home (My father gets it), but him and I 
both agree that their production values have gone down substancially, and 
about 1/3 of the magazine is all ads. I mostly read it for the user to 
user section, John C Dvorack's columns, and the Abort/Retry/Fail Section 
(Which sadly, has a newer, stupider name, as people just getting into 
computers wouldn't remember DOS commmands... sad.)

The only magazine that I read, and fully enjoy, is Consumer Reports. The 
articles are interesting, well written, and are very helpful in making 
purchases and stuff. Plus, their back page of "Selling It" is absolutely 
classic.
