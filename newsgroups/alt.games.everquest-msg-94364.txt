Yeah, except you put the totally unnecessary word "OOP"
in there for some reason.  OOP doesn't lend itself to
error-free code any more than any other type of programming
and, in fact, has its own breed of "hidden" problems that
can be significantly more difficult to find than those in other
methods.

The "secret" to good programming is thorough code review,
testing, and release practices, none of which are limited to
OOP.   Since it's fairly obvious that this particular bug is either
the result of flawed testing (hard to believe someone didn't
go whack something with multiple factions) or release (the
most likely choice, IMO) practices, OOP wouldn't have done
-anything- to correct it.  Or even prevent it.

And I won't even mention that "OOP programming" is redundant.
But what do I know, I've only been doing OOP development since
the mid-80s..
