What about using Copelands Weapon Analyzer to determine nice weapons?

Don't you want a faster weapon in the off hand?  I thought that each
time you swung your primary, a check is made to see if the secondary
is ready to swing again before performing the check for dual-wield
success.  If the secondary isn't ready, a second check will not be
made until the primary swings again.  Therefore, you want a faster
weapon in the off hand so that it is always ready to swing each time
the primary is swung.

With my 30 ranger, I found with Copeland's that I can't afford the 1HS
weapons that will outdamage a BABS 2HS.  If plat is no object then
fine, but for 125pp my BABS does more damage per minute than dual
wielding Icetooth claws and a Crystalized sword (lots more than
125pp).
