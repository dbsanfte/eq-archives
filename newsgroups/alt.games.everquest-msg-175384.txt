I used to use a kitchen timer for haste.  Other spells I usually refresh
when my buff starts going.

Usually they will start bitching when It's going out anyway.  I'm
playing an enchanter so I always do haste even when there's a shaman in
the party.  I don't cast haste on myself to time it because it's too
mana intensive to cast it more than absolutely neccessary.  I tried it
on my animation, but I usually miss the message, and I prefer charming
anyway (probably using your pet as a shaman though, so just go by that
if you can - that will be easiest), and you don't get a message on you
charmed pets.  

So I tried using a timer for mezes and hastes, bought at radio shack. 
Found I don't have the time to hit it when mezzing things, and found
that it was nearly useless for hastes because tanks would get dispelled,
or lag or something and it would wear off at odd times and It would
screw with my timer.  So I gave up on it.  Now I just wait for the
bitching to commense.  

I've come up with a mez timer on a hot button since, but it doesn't work
that great since I cant use any other hot buttons while it's going, and
if the party takes down the mezed mob and gets more for me to mez while
it's going I can't reset it.

I'd say try timing haste by your pet, and don't fret it.  If someone
else tells you to use a timer tell them to go jump in The Hole.
