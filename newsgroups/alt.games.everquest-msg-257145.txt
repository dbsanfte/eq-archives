At least they don't let Dark Elves be rangers.  Yet.

I can see their point WRT danger, but if they feel archery is too
safe, can't they just make it generate more aggro, wizard style[0]?
Or a bit more, to compensate for ranger being slightly less paper

[0] Assuming, of course, archery aggro isn't already like that -
playing neither a wizard nor a ranger I have no clue.
