Wow, thanks for this tip. :) I just got GoD recently (as in this weekend),
and after reading this, when I went home for lunch from work, I found a face
mask of frozen mana (4k on FV, at least today), went to Kaladim, and tried
it out, figuring if it wasn't worth it, I could always just resell it in
trader. 14,551 tribute points were offered for it, and were accepted. :) I
figured that's almost 4 times what I paid for it, since if I'd just turned
in the 4k plat, I would have gotten exactly 4k tribute points.

Just for sh*ts and giggles, I tried my cloak of greater pernicity to see
what I'd be offered for it...and was offered 23,745 tribute points. I didn't
donate that, but it's good to know for in the future. :)

Thanks again. I'm still learning all the quirks...er, features...of GoD. :)
