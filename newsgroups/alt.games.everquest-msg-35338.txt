There's just something really buggy about the GD zone anyway. It is, in fact,
the only zone that I've ever *personally* been in and had it crash down around
my ears on me.  And that's happened twice.  Also, our guild has recently had a
few cases of people zoning into GD and arriving not at the normal zone in point,
but in the mysterious empty box room near the center of the zone that GMs use
for "time out". (At least I assume that's what it's for.)  Admittedly, a quick
/petition will generally get you out undamaged in cases like this providing
there's a GM or guide on line, but it's still an annoyance. I have also zoned in
and appeared just outside of Thurgadin.  That one I don't mind at all, if that's
where I was heading anyway, but I can imagine those who are working on Giant
faction might get a bit peeved and/or dead over it.  That one hasn't happened in
a while though, so it may be fixed.
