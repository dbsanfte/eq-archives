    No, I'm saying test the other fellow's theory. With Project Illusion,
you and the ENC can walk into the Outpost without problems, the ENC can
charm the Foreman, and you can try the turn-in. With the book to PoK being
where it is, that wouldn't take much time at all. I don't think it'll work,
but no harm in trying other than a lost gem.

    Glowering is KOS. You start out either apprehensive (can use the
merchants) or dubious (cannot). From what I remember, nobody starts
indifferent or higher. And at least in the old days, parking a level 49 mage
pet in the middle of the sarnak spawns was a good way to collect whips for
turn-in. ;-)
