You REALLY should check your facts. THIS is where those numbers come
from.

"The BCS includes crimes which are not reported to the police, so it
is an important alternative to police records." - BCS

Here's a link from the VERY PAGE that the numbers come from. Capice?

Here's the actual publication. Look on page 41 and you'll find your
11,411 number. Get it? I looked at the source, you looked at an
article. Now hush.
