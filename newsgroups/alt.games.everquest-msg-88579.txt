The orc and dervish camps in the Commonlands are routinely camped on my server,
(Tholuxe Paells).  You can do a "/ooc looking for orc group" kinda thing of
course. 
It IS considered bad manners to pull from other peoples camps though, but you
can certainly ask if you can pull a few while they med.  Most people say yes.
I think it's rude if they don't.  But I just move on - they *were* there first.

I was doing Gnolls at the splitpaw spires one day and a single guy was sitting
at one of the spires looking at a  gnoll holding a fine steel weapon.  He said
he was waiting on his other guildies to get there and that they were "camping"
that spire.  20 minutes later he was STILL freakin waitin on his guildies - 
with perfectly good gnoll butt getting wasted.  Its kind of a shame - I still
kinda look down on that guild.
