No, I'm saying that some rules are quite unnecessary, and if breaking them
hurts no one, than by all means, break them.  Private or Public, there is a
law against oral sex.  Stupid law, and breaking it hurts no one (unless you
count an incident that occured once involving a slip and fall, but I won't
get into that).

It's about the equivalent of tattling on someone for chewing gum in class.
It's done out of spite.

And have you ever turned yourself in for speeding?

Live and let live is how I respect people.  If what you do doesn't hurt
anyone, go ahead and do it 'till you puke.
