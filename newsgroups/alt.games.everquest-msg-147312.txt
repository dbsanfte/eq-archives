Just out of curiosity, does the answer really matter to you?  Will you
suddenly start grouping more if the bonus is there...or start soloing if it
isn't?

Verant says there's a bonus, and it gets better with the more people you
have in it (I think the bonus starts at 3 people...but it might be 2).

I used to ask questions like these until I realized something kinda
important...I didn't really give a damn about the answer...it wasn't going
to change my gaming at all, so I stopped asking.
