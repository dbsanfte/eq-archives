My grinding spot is a mix of dark and light blue. I have a feeling it
will now feel like a mix of dark/light blue, and green.

I hope the clerics feel compensated. They get all the spells I'd want,
I get nothing, they're even more desirable for groups, and exp is
raised for mobs you need a group for and lowered for most soloable
stuff. Oh, and I am going to have to break my habit of snaring with my
epic, as it doesn't do that anymore (I guess some druids are going to
have a nasty surprise today).

I can't recall being depressed by a patch before.
