I made the trip mostly for the adventure of it, to see if it could be
done, with minor help, well the CS key is probably not that minor, but
still i made it, and who should twink me? my main is on another server
and he is only lvl 19, and i will NOT beg of them people in CS to
twink me, on thing i may ask for is invis to get back to skyshrine or
maybe DMF to go into sirens grotto, nothing more

Before i left neriak i put all my stuff, not much since i lost all my
patchwork armour in an earlyer death :( that armour i had bought for
money i earned from selling silk threads to a higher level for
probably way to much, but she did set the price.
