The first rule of expansions: get while the gettin' is good.

Loot that is too crappy or too rare considering the difficulty of the
encounter is explained away as "well, it can't all be godly loot".

Loot that is too plentiful or uber considering the difficulty of the
encounter will be cause to take the servers down for emergency
patching.


Of course, this is just database problems manifesting.  It has nothing
to do with people hearing about cobalt armor dropping off level 40
mobs in outdoor zones, rushing out to buy the expansion they had
decided not to buy, and then having the rug yoinked out from under
them. :-)
