If you are strictly solo, then I think this is the single expansion with the
least in it for you, in fact, nothing in it at all unless you are an
extremely overpowered soloer.  It would be possible to form a group of four,
get a mission, then have the other four disband, letting you go in alone...
but the mission would be balanced for a well formed group of four in that
case.

I've also seen it suggested that you could get two duos and split up, each
taking a different section of the dungeon; I guess you could do the same
thing as a soloer, find a group of three four or five that wants to do a
dungeon and will take you as another member of the group, but let you run off
by yourself instead of sticking with them.

Both those, in my opinion, are a real stretch

Other expansions have all had something for the solo player; more levels,
spells, areas where you could solo, disciplines, better transportation,
maps... I don't see anything at all in this expansion thats of benefit if you
aren't actually doing LDoN dungeons; the new special items that let you
improve existing equipment are no drop and turn the equipment you augment
into no drop gear till the aumentation is removed... -if- augmentations were
droppable, but only usuable by people with the LDoN expansion then they might
have been able to get their hooks into you, but thats not the case.

Oh wait, there's a transportation system that lets you port instantly between
two wayfarer camps; I guess you might want it to get from Butcherblock to SRo
easily... but why a soloer at 55 would care about that (they are all in
lowbie original world zones) I can't think.
