The visage line should be cast before the battle begins.  Horrifying visage
+10%,  and the SK's Voice of Thule +12% should be on the cast on the MT just
before they take agro.  Exspecaily if they use the AREA EFFECT taunt that
automaticaly gives then 10% more hate than the highest character on the hate
list.  IF you had a ranger doing there shield abiaslity to build hate, and
he did say 2000 points of hate, when the AoTaunt hit with thease two spells
on the MA would have 2684 points of hate.  The SK's agro spell last a fair
amount of time with a long recast, the enchanters goes away fairly quickly,
witha managadle recast.  If it looks like the MA isn't going to make it for
4 ticks the enchanter should hold off on casting it on the MA and instead
hit the SA with it.  Now it the SA is a SK that will increase his best Taunt
spell to 660 points every 7.5 seconds, or 2640 Points of hate before the
spell wares off, given that he hasn't got agro by then.

No what was said about getting agro because it is a buff, that is corect,
but the real reason you are grabbing agro is because you didn't wait long
enough before you sat down.  If there are adds this is the last spell you
will be casting, just let the SK's deal there Agro spell it lasts 10 minutes
compared to 36 seconds.
