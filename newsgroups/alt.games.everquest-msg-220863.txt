Yeah, basicly.  Of course, there were two of us, both mid-50s, we had
SoW and Invis (damn those stupid frog Shaman anyway), and we got xp
when we had to fight.  Now, after doing it with a Druid on another
server at a later date I would have had no trouble finding them at
all, once you've tracked/pulled them a few times for a group keying
up you know where to wait in ambush, saves a lot of running around.
