No I did not.  My statements include:

    "Even if Section 33 of the Charter is used, it has a maximum
effect of five years. "

and, in answer to you:

    "> And can be renewed indefinitely under section 33[4],  5 years

     >time.

    With the accompanying disruptions every time, and the further
    weakening of our Charter rights."

and

    "Such a law may exist for a maximum of 5 years (renewable)."

So on at least three occasions I stated a maximum of five years, and
on two of them mentioned or acknowledged that this is renewable.
Strictly speaking Section 33 can be used for any period *up to* 5
years.  At the end of that time the legistlature must re-enact (not
really the same as renew, but close enough) the act.

Wrong again.  A few samples of what I did, in fact, write:

    "Given the recent court ruling same-sex marriage is a foregone
conclusion in
     Canada, even if things are slightly delayed by a potential
appeal. "

and then I said

    "The federal gov't has not, IIRC, officially responded yet.
     It would be SOP for them to wait until the deadline for
provincial
     appeal has passed before taking a stand.  Given the current
political
     climate, though, all bets are off when it comes to predictions."

later, in ref. to the gov't comment on Saturday, I said

     "I would guess that they are seriously
      considering this option- why else comment on it, and not the
other
      three options they are considering?"

note the word "guess".


I haven't read the press release, but the way it is covered at
http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2002/07/29/samesex_cauchon020729 is
certainly interesting.  The Justice Minister's quote seems to say that
the governement is not opposing or sopporting same-sex marriage, they
are just unclear as to what to do.  This lets them delay things and
dumps the responsibility on the courts.... but also potentially gives
up control to the courts.  On a purely political level this is a
brilliant move- whatever the outcome, they can deny any responsibility
for it, and it gives them several more years before they have to deal
with the issue.  (Wonder what they'll do if the court denies the
appeal?)

This is another case of misreading on your part, I think.  They only
mention of a majority I made was in connection to the functions of
parliament- i.e. a majority vote is needed in Parliament to approve a
bill.  Unless, of course, you let the courts decide.  Part of the
function of the higher courts is to look at the voices of individuals,
not just the majority.

So you believe that invoking Section 33 for the purpose of removing
one of the rights in sections 2 and 7-15 does not create a precedent
weakening our rights?

Just to be clear:  you DO NOT think that any event in which the
governement removes our rights as granted under the Charter, that
makes it easier for future governments to remove more rights?

Actually you don't have a clue what you're talking about, but feel
free to remain stobbornly ignorant if you want.    Never mind that
this whole debate was generated by the Ontario Superior Court using
Section 15 of the Charter *as modified by the Supreme Court* to make
the recent decision.   I guess they're wrong too, according to you.

It was always moot to me, YOU seem to care about the potential
financial impact, and I did discuss that with you, but I don't really
care what way the financial scales tip, I just think your assement is
wrong.

Usually read them twice, actually.  You might want to try that, since
you open this message by incorectly paraphrasing me.

I see.  So why did you use as an arguement:

     "But there's a hell of a difference between passing a law
benefiting
      4% of the  population at the expense of the rest with no
      compelling reason or benefit"

I seems that you feel numbers have something to do with this issue, or
at least it did in your other message.   You also deny that many peope
could see "reason and benefit".

Marriage has been redefined before, many times.   Today's marriage has
many differences from the 1950's nuclear family, for example.  It has
nothing in common with the legal marriage of the middle ages.   As
stated before I'm not a big supporter of marriage, but I see no reason
why its definition can't be updated, just as so many other definitions
have been (for example "person" now means a man or woman, nor just a
man.)

> It is akin to a group of people wanting to be declared

> veterans.

Ah, but the question here is WHO decides if they are, or are not,
veterans?   Are *you* willing to make that decisions?  Maybe the
attitudes of soceity have changed on that.  For example, a nurse in
WWII did not take part in combat, but she might be considered a
deserving of some benefits for her participation in the war: what we
normally think of as veteran's benefits.  ( I don't know what the
status of nurses from wars is, this is a theoretical example).

So, in our society today we see same-sex couples cohabitating, many
raising children, living together in a visible way, no different than
opposite-sex couples who marry (with or without children).  Most women
now work, even if married, and a growing number of people decide not
to have children at all (IIRC our birth rate is still in sharp
decline).   Clearly the definition of marriage is up for review!   I
would rather get rid of it entirely, others want it opened to same-sex
couples, and you seem to want to leave it unchanged.  I know some
people think that only couples who plan to have children should be
allowed to marry.

No, not really.  As I have pointed out, other than a few hassles there
is almost nothing that would change in the lives of most Canadian
same-sex couples.  There are very few benefits or responsibilities
that married couples have which are denied common-law couples
(although those differences are not unimportant).  You seem to keep
forgetting that we already have common-law status for same-sex couples
in this country!

I'll grant that I don't know the budget numbers here.  We also have
different viewpoints and are talking past each other.  The
province/money issue is really at issue here, anyway, so I'll move on
to your next point (snipping out the parts where you substitute
riddicule for an actual point).

Hey, if you just want to say "I feel this way, live with it" I can get
gehind that attitude.  if you join a discussion, though, expect that
you'll be asked to illustrate why you feel that way, and asked to
justify your statements.

Ah, but does that make it right to add that stress on top of everyday
life, when removing the problem is so simple?  You seem to feel that
Albertans are getting a raw deal financially... would you rather live
with that because its no more stressful than anything else in life, or
would you rather solve that problem, at least?

Today I pretty much don't (as previously stated).   Before Jan. 1,
2001, it was a hassle.  I'll give you one example:  when we bought our
house (1997) , I was in my last year of college.  Dealing with CHMC
was no problem, but our mortgage broker did have a few issues with
lenders.  Students are notoriously poor, I was no exception, and most
lenders would not put me on the mortgage and/or agree to the mortgage
if I was on the property title because they saw us as two single men.
(They had a point- in a legal proceeding they could not sue us jointly
in the same way they could a married couple).  Eventually we found a
lender who recognised same-sex couples, although the lending rate was
not as great as other offers.   It was worth it to make sure my name
was on the property title (I assume you know the advantages to that).

Similarly we spent a lot of time and money making sure our wills gave
us inheritance rights similar to what married people get (and take for
granted).  Most- but not all- of this is now given under the
common-law status.

I don't know if you are single or in a long-term relationship.  It was
not until I had been in a relationship for many years and developed
joint property, joint use of utilities, joint bank account, joint
savings, joint bills, etc.  that I realised how many things are
affected by your relationship status!   Most of them are little
things, although a few are costly, but they certainly add up.

In which case you would rule it justifiable discrimination, as court
did in the past.  Even if so, on what grounds will you argue who
should receive that priviledge?

We actually have a point of agreement here.  In the last few centuries
marriage has become a very muddled thing indeed.  Do you prefer the
approach of treating everyone the same- single or not- or that
relationships should be recognised, but without distinction as to type
of relationship?
