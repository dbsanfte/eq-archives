I totally understand where you're coming from, but I find that, after 
having tasted the ZEMs in PoP, I cannot go back to grind experience in 
the old zones. Of course, if I'm in, say, Kael or Sebilis trying to get 
some loot, I'll probably get xp at 60 that I wouldn't at 61, but I would 
never set in a place to grind xp outside PoP.

Still, there are no spells at 61 that I particularly care for (neither 
at 60, or 62, for that matter), so if the level alone doesn't increase 
my effectiveness a lot (by allowing me to single-pull more stuff), I'll 
probably defer levelling.
