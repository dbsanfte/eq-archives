What would be really nice is to borrow one of Anarchy Online's best
interface features: drop an item on the chat box and it effectively
becomes a hyperlink, displayed differently than normal text.  When
someone else clicks on that active section of text, a window pops up
with all the item information & stats.

Doubt we'll see this in EQ any time soon though.  It would probably
break the "fantasy metaphor" or somesuch, even though players do it all
the time anyway.
