When did they change this?

There are only two real differences...

1. Rogues are also invis to undead when they hide.
2. Rogues get a message telling them if they succeed or fail.

If you want to get hide/sneak to work with a non-roguem, sneak first,
and make sure you are, in fact, sneaking.  You can tell, because you
will move slower.

Now hide.  The only ways to tell if you succeeded is to have someone
else tell you (if you view yourself in 3rd person, it will look like
you succeeded, even if you did not) or to consider something that is
normally hostile.  If it cons as neutral, then you succeeded, and
should be hiding and sneaking until you zone.
