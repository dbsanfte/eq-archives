The reason you can spend days on end in old world zones with characters who are
15-25 is that its a simple matter to take a character from 15 to 25 in one day,
untwinked, unPLed, in Paladul, while its apparantly possible to spend days on
end doing the same thing in other zones.

Paladul Caverns gives literally twice the exp for killing a same level mob, and
yet killing the mobs there is actually easier than killing many old world mobs.

Not only does PC draw most players in that level range, but it also moves them
past that level range quickly, so you don't have a large population of people
that level to worry about spreading around.

Boosting the ZEM of other zones would only mean the same "problem" of people
basically skipping these levels.  If you really want them to spend some time
from 15 to 25, and see them explore other zones of that level range, then
killing the ZEM of PC is indeed the solution.

Personally, I think this late in the game's life span, having the opportunity to
rapidly level up characters to catch up with my friends is a welcome thing.  But
thats just me, and I'm sure not a SOE strategist, they may agree with you.
