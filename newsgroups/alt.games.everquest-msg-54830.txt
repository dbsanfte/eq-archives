Read very carefully what I said, please...

"...but we can draw aggro the best (Disease Cloud/Shadow
Vortex and Stun) so the tank-hybrids can relieve some stress off the Clerics
and Enchanters to buy time for Mes or heals on that Warrior."

Humm... upon gaining aggro I return to the -original- target. The -one- the
Warrior called to assist. Now, the add is getting shots off on me instead of
the Enchanter or Cleric... hooray! The Enchanter can mes the one that was
beating on me. While my HPs and AC are important, they are not as important
as the Warrior's so I can afford to be at 60% health for quite some time.
Provided a Druid is in the group, that's what Group Regen/Chloro is for.

Also, the personal insults are not needed. I'm trying to convey my opinion,
and I think I'm at least doing it in a polite, respectful manner. If you
have to insult and berate me, you should look into learning another way to
express your thoughts.
