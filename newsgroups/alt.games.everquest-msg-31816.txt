Another excellent option is to hang out in EC for an evening or 2...
true, losing exp and fighting time is a pain, but is often worth it.
As a for example, while at lvl 15, I stopped to watch everything, and
managed to pick up a Giant Woven Vest (ac18, str +20, sv cold, etc
etc) for 50pp off of a 44th gnome who obviously had no use for it.
Have also picked up some excellent low/mid level weapons cheap from
those in a hurry to dump and run - Blade of Xygoz for 100pp... Giant
Militia LS's for 20pp... Crystal Fibre for 25pp... 

At 21 I still dual wield a pair of the Crystal Fibres... cannot beat
the delay vs damage vs cost ratio, and got the pair for under 75pp...
you can also find crafted for sale there relatively cheaply as well...
have picked up 3 pieces for far less than the cost of the gems to
quest for them.

And, as a warrior, and, more importantly, a tank, you will want the
faster weapon to make you more effective in taunting while grouping.
Having a cleric is nice.  Having a dead healer sucks because he cast
healing on you while fighting 2-3 orcs on Orc HWY in NRo...
