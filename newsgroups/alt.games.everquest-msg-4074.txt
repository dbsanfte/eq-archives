I am guessing that they forgot to adjust the vendor
buy back price for the cultural armors that they just
removed the expensive gems from.

Of course the people on the test server probably
discovered this and informed their buddies on the live
servers to start cranking and selling armor as soon as
the servers were up today. Same thing happened with
tool boxes and pie tins.

But that's just a guess. =)
