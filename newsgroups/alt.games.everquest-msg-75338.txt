There's also a quest based around killing corrupt guards.  Verant intends
for them to be taken down.  They intend for SB's to be there to perform a
service.  As far as I know, there's no quest about taking down the SB's.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
