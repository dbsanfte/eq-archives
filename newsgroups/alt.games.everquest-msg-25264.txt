Hmm... How about a 29th level enchanter spell (enchanters are all agnostic,
right?) called Imbue Crystal? Crystals would become a mid level mob drop,
perhaps also available from a single merchant in Erudin (from whence comes
most of Norrath's enchanters, it seems.) Imbued crystal jewelry would grant
+INT, +STA and -AC. Agnostic idols would alter no stats but give a small mana
regen.
