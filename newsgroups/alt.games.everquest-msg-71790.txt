I have yet to figure out how to use the alternate advancement
system.  Part of my trouble is my main being a Bard which has been
hit and miss since SoL came out, so I have been just popping in most
days to check on the status of the game.  Anyway can some one tell
me how to redirect my XP into the alternate advancement tree for my
52 Bard.  I looked for some button or other but found none on any
screen.  Thank you for your time.
