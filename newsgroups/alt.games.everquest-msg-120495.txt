What I did was click Enchanter on the right hand side under the Spell
lists header
http://lucy.fnord.net/spelllist.html?classes=ENC&source=Live

Then click the spell I wanted to look at (Aanya's Quickening) in this
case
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1708&source=Live

This lists the Mana casting time fizzle time etc.

I'm usins some old version of netscrape and the text does not show up
properly against the black background, but if I select the text with a
right button mouse sweep I can see the values.

Here is what I see :

Aanya's Quickening Detail | History | Stacking 

Slot Description
Increase Attack Speed by 64%

Mana:275
Skill:Alteration
Casting Time:4
Recast Time:0
Fizzle Time:2.25
Resist:Unresistable
Range:125
Location:Any
Time of Day:Any
Target Type:All
Source:Live 06/05
Classes:ENC/53
Duration:24.0 mins
Cast on you:You experience a quickening.
Cast on other:Someone experiences a quickening.
Wears off:Your speed returns to normal.

HTH,

Jim
