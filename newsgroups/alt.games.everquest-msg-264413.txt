Well yes and no. Nobody told me that the scarab had a Riposte that would 
one-shot me dead, I certainly learned that the hard way. The only indication 
I had was that the mob was an undercon. Eh, didn't help me much. ;-)

But you're right in your general feeling that there's more communication 
than necessary. I would not mind seeing less communication. The Solo vs 
Group thing isn't bad. The bigger problem I think is the highlighting of 
linked mobs. This not only tells you more will come, it tells you exactly 
which and how many. Maybe a better solution would be the kind of thing that 
Warlords II did, where you could tell by the adjective used to describe the 
group the approximate range of mobs that would come. You'd still have to 
learn the hard way which would come, how many and from which direction. But 
I do like the fact that not all of them will social aggro. When you approach 
a group of 20 mobs in the same proximate area, it's frustrating to realize 
that you can't do much of anything about it with your current group because 
the odds are completely against you. I think it's much more fun to know that 
even in this dense situation you have some reasonable shot at success, 
albeit risky, because not everything will come, and you just don't know 
which. That would be a plus in my book.

Only to those who choose to limit themselves in that fashion. I'm telling 
you, I've only grouped with chanters twice, it's never been required even 
though the vast majority of battles I've fought have been with linked mobs. 
You just don't hear people say "We can't do that without a chanter". So far 
the game hasn't presented anything approaching a requirement. However, when 
you consider that the majority of players are coming from EQLive, it 
shouldn't be surprising that you'll see some people who bring with them 
those last vestiges of the old world. Some habits never change. I still see 
some morons arguing in chat that you can't do a serious encounter without a 
Cleric and that Shamans and Druids won't cut it. Some people will never let 
go and will never learn.

This may become a problem in later levels, I don't know. The problem you're 
correctly highlighting is that encounters have to be tuned with one 
expectation or another. Either the encounter is do-able without a chanter 
and then too easy with one, or it's challenging with a chanter and then 
ridiculous or impossible without. I think the answer here goes to the same 
issues that screwed up Slows in EQLive: just don't over do the effectiveness 
of these spells. Keep resistance levels high enough to maintain the mystery 
and the challenge, and keep the effectiveness under control so that you 
don't wind up with a 75% slow, etc, and you probably can manage a situation 
where there's a range of possibilities that includes significant challenges 
with or without. This is the situation that I witness today, and I hope it's 
how it will remain throughout.
