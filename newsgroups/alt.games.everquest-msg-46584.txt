Yes but they are doing this in research facilities that are in most
cases fairly large (not someones garage or bathroom) and take a high
degree of skill. I've worked in a few different bio-tech firms and I
can tell you it's not that easy to alter an organism to the point that
it is "trivial". 

I don't doubt that if given enough time, funding and the proper
facilities someone could develop an existing virus into something very
nasty but this is beyond the scope of what a terrorist living in
secret in the US would be capable of even if they had a good
bio-chemical background.

It is something that will have to be dealt with in the future I'm sure
but now the main focus should deal with low-tech things that can be
used as mass-destruction weapons such as airplanes, trucks, trains and
bombs. They are a much larger threat right now.
