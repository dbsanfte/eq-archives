    yucky, this NG is so cliquey it's not funny! It's like an old boy's
club. Are you guys all in the same guild or something? The guy posted caps
because he's shouting about it and you might note his meaning AND tone are
clear. Furthermore, his grammar although not correct in the anally retentive
sense, is in fact true to colloquial use of the language both orally and in
written text.

    And his sentiments... did anyone notice them? The Bugged Bandidos thread
has been re-cropping up every couple of days here for a week or two, and
they finally fixed it. Do we respond to that? Do we agree with that
sentiment?

    No, we flame. We want to discourage new people from posting and taking
our laughable little clique-show away from us. Quick! Somebody bring up KEI
or turn it into an "I know more than you do about eq" contest!
