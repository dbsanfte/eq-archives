The amount of exp points to get an AA point is static.

However, the amount of your exp bar that you'd have to sacrifice to get that
same AA point changes, as does the number of mobs of level X you'd have to kill.

Lets say, just for the sake of arguement (and cause I'm too lazy to look the
numbers up) that it takes 100,000 xp points to go from level 51 to 52.  And that
it takes the same number of points to get a single AA point.  Well, if you go
50% AA at level 51, then you'll get one AA and hit level 52 at the exact same
time (which would be exactly twice as long to hit level 52 as if you'd put 100%
into regular exp.)  But say it takes 200,000 xp points to go from level 53 to
54.  Now if you go 50% AA at 53, you'll get your first AA halfway into 53, and a
second just as you ding 54.  OK, well what about if it takes 500,000 exp points
to get from level 59 to 60.  Now each time you get a yellow of 59 you'll ding an
AA point.

BUT lets say you are killing level 45 mobs, which give you 5000 xp at level 51.
You'll have to kill 20 of them to ding an AA at 100% AA.  At level 53, however,
you may only be getting 4000 xp per level 45 mob.  This would mean that now
you'd have to kill 25 of them.  At 59 you may be getting only 1000 xp per level
45 mob.  This would mean you'd have to kill 100 of the very same mob for the
very same AA point!

To counter that, you'll have to consider how much time and effort it will take
you to kill a level 45 mob at various levels.  You might find yourself killing
one every ten minutes at 51, two every ten minutes at 53, and 20 every ten
minutes at level 59.

And of course nothing forces you to keep killing level 45 mobs, you might move
to level 47 mobs which you can get 6000 xp for and kill one every ten minutes at
53, or so on and so forth.

Another interesting factor is the degree to which having AA points helps you to
kill mobs faster.  Here, what the AA point in question is for matters a lot; for
many classes Run 1, 2, and 3 may make a drammatic difference, making killing
easier and reducing the number of deaths you suffer (which cost exp both
directly and in terms of time lost recovering the body and buffs and rez effects
if any)  There are some AA that you can't get till 56, others you can't get till
59, still others you must be 61 to 65 for.  Some AA points don't really help you
get exp faster (mass group buff would be one example) while others might have
directly visible effects (say one that increases damage done per nuke, if you
get all your exp via nuking)

And I noted already but should reinforce, level will also help you kill more
things faster in most cases; you'll resist better, mobs will resist less, you'll
do more melee damage and soak up more, you'll get new spells, new disciplines...
higher levels tend to matter a lot.  The flip side of that is that you get less
exp for the same kill, while increasing your AA points doesn't have that
disadvantage.

Now as I said, I made up the actual numbers, and I should point out I also made
up the ratio between the various levels.  This is the way things work in
general, but the proportions are just as wrong as the actual numbers, so you
can't use them to figure out optimal killing plans of any sort.

For my cleric, the optimal point at which to go to AA would have been level 61.
At that point, there were still plentiful blue mobs I could solo for exp outside
the planes, or kill fairly simply in groups in the first tier planes; beyond
that point exp slowed down massively until I got my flag for POV/POS; so it was
there that I could get the most exp and also where my AA points cost the least;
higher level the AA would cost even less proportional to my level, but my exp
coming in dropped dramatically.

Subsequent to that, they've lowered the level of mob which will give exp for the
post 60 crowd, dramatically dropped the exp bonus for the planes, made it
trivial for people to get into the higher tier planes, dramatically raised the
group exp bonus... all of which is to say, I don't have any idea where the ideal
point to stop and do AA would be now, I suspect it would be level 65...
