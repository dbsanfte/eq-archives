I just came back from EF and hunting mamas...  Apparently (although I did
not personally experience this)  People that were trying to leave EF via
Blackburrow were crashing to desktop each and every time they tried to zone
in.  I've never seen so many people screaming for ports out of EF...  LOL

I had been camped in EF when we installed SoL today...  (Yeah, I know I said
earlier that it wouldn't be til xmas, but hell, it arrived in the mail and
we're gluttons for punishment...  LOL) and was having fun hunting mamas, so
I didn't try to leave.

Anyone else having this problem?  Also, what about that problem of the chat
screen freezing whenever people are medding?  Apparently the people this is
happening too also cannot see their mana and health increasing while they
med.

I'm having no real troubles with the measly 128 Ram we have, but tried
making a Vah Shir and it was WAY too choppy and jerky...

Comments?
