Maybe he's a devout believer in a very shy god who doesnt like people
to talk about her ;-)

Bah. I'm agnostic and I still like the artistry in some of the Hindu
representations. And... well, it *is* agnostic, not atheist. I would
guess you could make an argument (which verant do frequently) that its
more a "I dont want to choose between these gods" or "I dont feel
particularly devout about any of you unpredictable bastards" attitude
in Norrath rather than an "I deny you exist." take.

I mean, that'd be pretty hard to credit with a cleric sitting in your
party going "Does that hurt? Look all fixy! I told you so. *smirk*"
every time you got beaten up ;)

As Norraths religious and magical systems seem to be based around
the belief of the imbuer or caster (I am healed regularly by people
who worship other deities, etc) in just about every other area, I 
*guess* Tunare might permit the creation of a lower powered idol 
as a sort of dealeresque "the first ones free but now you got to 
commit to me for the real bonuses"...

Of course, this is idle speculation, but hey, what are newsgroups for? ;)
