You can get a boat to Kunark from either Butcherblock Mountains to Firiona
Vie (for good people), or from Oasis to the outpost in Overthere (for evil
smelly trolls and such).
There is a boat to Velious from North Ro that brings you to Iceclad Ocean.
To get to Luclin you go to certain wizard spires which become active every
15 minutes or so and port you to The Nexus.
To get to the Planes of Power, you click on books which are found all over
the world, and get ported up to the Plane of Knowledge

Of course, the quickest way to get to any of these places is by wizard or
druid port, boats take a looong time to get from A to B.
