Just upgraded to WinXP on my main machine.

AMD Athlon 1800
KT133 mobo
2 x DDR 2600 256mb memory
GeForce3 Ti500 
120gb 7200rpm 8mbcache HD
SB128 pci sound
Stable DSL connection

Upgrading to WinXP on a new clean HD caused a drop in graphics
performance, although load times are significantly faster across the
board. The extra graphics lag is barely noticeable unless on a raid, but
it's a definite drop in performance that 'shouldn't' be there.

3DMark2001 was giving me 6000 benchmark with XP's autoinstalled DX8.1
and drivers, then latest video drivers, and then WinXP critical updates.

Installed Via 4in1 drivers and went to 6600 benchmark, but still had the
slight graphics lag.

Installed the noncritial updates (including some related to AMD) from
MSoft, switched AGP appeture to 32mb (half of vid card memory) and
haven't benched yet, but didn't notice any changes in EQ.

EQ specifc ini changes didn't seem to make a lot of difference either
(16/32mb, models etc.) so I'm thinking it's likely to be a DX/driver/XP
quirk I haven't ironed out

Any other XP savvy people got any hints and tricks on how to speed up
performance. Had my old W98 setup pretty well tuned by tweaking install
order and a few other things
