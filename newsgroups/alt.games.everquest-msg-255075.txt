Much to my dismay, about the only thing for unguilded and/or casual players
for decent items is LDoN.  And LDoN crawls getting boring.  They're the same
dungeons over and over again.  Two - three hours for two AA bubbles and 51
adventure points is pretty pointless.  I'd just rather go explore a zone and
get experience that way.  But at 65, unless I want to tank something that
hits like a truck (500-1000 points per hit certainly gets my attention), I'm
stuck too.
