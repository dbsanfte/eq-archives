Well, EQ tradeskill system certainly sucks a lot, but i heard about "you
cannot learn anymore from it" items that the "triviality" only give a 10%
bonus when reached. Which means that even if you score 10 times the skill
required to trivial an item it won't change the chances of success.
btw i'm sure that the EQ tradeskill system is fucked up on purpose, it seems
that the low ranges of success prevents anyone from making benefits from
tradeskill. I can't say why they did that, certainly for preventing from
forges, ovens, and other tradeskills spots camping or maybe intensive
mudflation...
