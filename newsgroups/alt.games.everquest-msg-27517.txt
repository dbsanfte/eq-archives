You know, sometimes I read a little to much into things.

I was looking closely at the screen shots of Fansy and noticed ~"27 points
of non melee damage" while running around Ro.

I was reading about how gear cheaters were having problems with running so
fast they killed themselves with drops by just running down a slope.

I have a bard. Selo's is great, but not that great. I run all over Ro with
my Shammy. Druid, and Bard. Yeap, you can get a legal 27 point drop, just
kind of rare and will leave me wondering. Probably just a hot computer with
a good connection, I wonder.
