I feel strongly about it, too.  Plat Sellers (I use this as a generic
term to cover all games currency sellers) and, lately the
"Pay-to-be-Powerlevelled" merchants are lower than vermin.  They
infest the games, opening them up to any brainless, talentless,
clueless shithead who has enough money to buy their way to success  -
invariably because they can't be bothered do it any other way.  [Oh,
and people NEED to be powerlevelled in WoW?  Jeezuz, WoW is so easy
you'd have to have the brain and talent of an amoeba to need
powerlevelling in THAT game.  But I digress...]

Oddly, I have no objections to MMORPG's that have a free, limited
version of their game, should you not *want* to buy the official
in-game extras off the game company.  That's fair enough, I think, as
you know well beforehand where the goalposts are, but this turning a
blind eye to Plat/Item Sellers in MMORPG's people pay subscriptions
for should stop. 

Whether it's "Macro-Miners" in Eve Online or "Plat-Sellers" in EQ,
they DO indeed ruin the game and the game's economy - and none of the
game companies give a toss or do anything to cure the problem.  If
"Company X" gets a new player account because Bubba plans to buy
himself a Fungi Tunic and Uber Gear on his first day, so what?  It's
another fee-paying customer.  If it's five or six accounts belonging
to item farmers, that's even more subscription money for them. They
just plain don't mind people contravening the EULA if it means they
make more money off it

I also apologise for hijacking the thread, but this really makes me
angry too. Rant over  :)
