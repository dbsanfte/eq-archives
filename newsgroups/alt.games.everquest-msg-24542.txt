All I know is that when my Enchanter gets to the appropriate level he will
go to the appropriate zones, get loot, get EXP and not have to fight with
level 50's twinking their alts, guildies or bank account.

That will make me enjoy the game even more.

BTW when I took my Iksar SK to the Warrens there were plenty of PU groups
available. Maybe it's server-related or peak-time issues.

On a side note, I won the roll for a Vermiculated Bracer in Fear last
weekend. I wonder what my chances would have been if they weren't no-drop...
