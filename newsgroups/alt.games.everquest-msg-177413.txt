As of patch day today (1/28), you still holding to this ;p? 

Hmmmm. Seems removing...

<Include>EQUI_BigBankWnd.xml</Include>

from EQUI.xml is working for some. Can we say.. rushing the damn thing
out the door? Considering that this is a VERY wide spread problem (the
crashes from the patches today), It would be safe to say... thier beta
process on the new expansion stinks if there even is a process going
on. Ive defended sony in the past on these kinds of things, but this
is sheer stupidity. To be fair, it sounds like (from reading the tech
support boards some) the problem is in the distribution process. Those
that played on the test server seem to be not having the problems.
Poor planning and execution. Feels like all the servers are becoming
the "test" server. Hell, the test server is probably more stable.
