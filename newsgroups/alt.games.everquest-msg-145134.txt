I've heard this before, except the rollover point was said to be 254.  
Someone hen provided a rather cute proof that it was a cap rather than a 
rollover, but I can't remember what the proof was.

}Kaev <--- never had a resist over 130

Heh, don't worry, as soon as you raid a dragon or so, it'll happen.  That 
one bard song gives ya +100 right off the bat. :)
