*sigh* Just when I thought I would be able to buy TBoots for my
character, you have to go and make them no drop 
/shout 52 Necro Looking for super green, no xp, Kobold group!

I understand that you want to cut down on twinking level 1 characters
with these things, but is this honestly the best way? There are going
to be a lot of high level evil race characters that are going to be
flooding Sol to get good faction now, for me those mobs will not give
xp, this is going to cause a problem in the future, I can just see it
now....

/petition some level 50 guy is in here camping the kobolds and he wont
give up the camp, says he needs it for faction!

Ok, cat's out of the bag� Yes, the Traveler's Boots are in the game.
And I suppose there really isn't any point in trying to hide where
they are� so how about I pass on an answer to your question?


quote:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I agree and disagree with you. I think this may cause some problems
with high level people being in the zone. I don't agree that it will
be in the future though. I think in the short term there will be an
influx of higher level people in the zone trying to gain faction so
they can purchase boots. I think in the future we will see more
players of the target level range in the zone building faction while
EXPing. 

So to answer your Question:

I'm not sure if this is the best solution, but I think it's a good
one.

- Steve Burke

And I agree. The vendor needed to be in a place that would make it at
least challenging for a 6th level character with thousands of plat
handed to them to get the boots, and yet not be too out of the way.
This seems to be a great place to put them.

Believe me, your going to see solb FLOODED with people trying
desperatly to fix their faction... ITs going to take me several months
to fix what I've dont to mine, meanwhile I will be taking 2 or 3
"Camps" in solb away from people who could gain experiance there.

Any chance you could reset the gnome faction, or stick that vendor on
BetaNeutral? If not, I fear that since their nodrop and people can't
just buy em off someone with good faction, solb is going to be a VERY
crowded place.

I understand that problem. But we this is one of the times where we
have to say, sorry, that's the way it is.

Suppose we were to have placed a neat new item on a vendor that had
good faction with� dunno, let's say Dwarves. Then some people who had
bad faction with Dwarves would have to fix that to use the vendor and
get the item. You knew that Gnomes are the guys that make some of the
more interesting items in the game (can you say Tinker's Bag?). If we
added a new vendor purchasable Axe of Dwarven Stone to a vendor on the
docks in Butcherblock that was on a Dwarven faction, then I'd also be
saying to you "sorry, but that's who sells the item".

The only solution to this concern would be to never add a new item
unless it was on a vendor that would sell to everyone. That's not a
restriction we're willing to work under.

This is the vendor that should sell this item. We can't take into
account how every character might or might not have ruined his faction
with the Gnomes (or the Dwarves, or the Druids, or the Dark Elves or�)
when putting in new items.


Vendui Absor,

Just a quick question regarding the new boots. I'm hoping that the
design team has considered the faction issues involved with the gnomes
in Sol A. Even by killing every kobold and his brother's brother in
Sol B for months, my Teir'Dal Shadowknight self, was never able to
purchase a tinker's bag. I would hope that this has been thoroughly
tested and is reasonable for evil race, evil class, evil god folks.

Not that I personally have an issue, I got my j-boots with uncommon
luck a long time ago.

Thanks,

Hi there.

Yes, our testers did just that. They used an Iksar worshiper of Cazic
and a Troll Shaman of Innoruuk, and they were able to purchase the
boots with some faction work. It was not a devastating task. People in
house have done it too, even in the few short days since the patch.
Folks that ruined their faction tremendously by hunting Gnomes and
such were able to get boots in the last few days�


but evil races already start with bad faction.so if i want boots be a
good race or prepare to work on faction for several days?

-ClockworkGnome

Yes, evil races will have to work on their faction if they want to buy
the boots.


Actually, getting faction for the Travelers Boots won't require a
high-level character to monopolize a camp, shutting out those who
COULD be getting experience. As most people know, you can get faction
with a mob merely by being on its hatelist when it dies -- a level 60
necromancer (who will not get experience from *anything* in Sol A) can
simply set up camp where some lower-level players have, and cast his
level 1 lifetap spell on each mob as the group fights it. Or better
yet, a spell in the Engulfing Darkness line, thus helping out the
lowbies as well as getting on the hatelist.

Of course, you should ask the lowbies before you do this, but I've
never run into someone who minded me getting faction from the mobs
they were fighting (as long as I didn't killsteal!).

- Teramenor

Thanks for pointing that out.

Getting faction is pretty darn easy now, unlike the olden days when
you had to get credit for the kill to get the faction modifier�

And you don't have to destroy the fun of others to do it.


Who was that masked quote-man? 

- Xelene Solyric

Oh, oops.

I'll edit that. Thanks for pointing it out.

Nice work, You have now taken an entire resource from
Druids/Rangers/Shammans. Yes SoW that nice old spell that allows us to
run fast and able to get away from MoB's when things don't go our way.
Our ability to cast on others so that they can run fast to.

First you made a quest that allowed people to get a pair of Jboots
that was not quite as fast as SoW. Then you made the ability to make
potions that cast SoW to be sold by Shamans only. Now you have a
vendor selling Boots with SoW for everyone that has 5k or so. 

Wow so much for SoW huh. May I ask when you are going to allow us to
spend 5-7k for a clarity stick? This is ridiculous and I can't beleive
you would do this to those of us that have these classes. Even more
reason for the other classes to think we really dont matter in the
great scheme of things.

Your Humble Druid of the 54th season.

Eldriken

Two points.

One: Jboots are a lot slower than SoW.
Two: Tboots are exactly the same speed as Jboots.

This will not reduce the value of Spirit of Wolf or Spirit of Wolf
potions much, if at all.
