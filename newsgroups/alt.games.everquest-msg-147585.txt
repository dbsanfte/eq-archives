Fish rolls, Fuzzlecutters, bandages, two rings and 1 necklace.

The two rings and the neck I usually wear (soloing or tanking) are velium 
fire rings and a spider fur collar. If I have a tank, though, I bust out 
the STR and DEX neck and rings... It adds a bit more to my DPS.

And yes, my main is a monk :)
