This reminds me of a moment in EC, when I was with a Guildy Wizzie who was
looking for the TL spell, when it was first patched.  We finally found
someone selling it for 2k and he paid for it, and was no sooner done
scribing it, than the seller asked for a TL, to which my bud responded
"sure, it will cost you 2k".  The price on some of these spells is
rediculous, especially when you consider I tried to buy Bristlbane's bundle
for my mage twink, and I couldn't find it for less than 1k.  That's a bit
steep for a spell which summons a box of cake, booze, and a firework.
