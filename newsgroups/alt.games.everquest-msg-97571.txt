Can we cut out the "you shouldn't be meleeing" nonsense :)? My druid still
melees at 42, its an invaluable way of finishing a fight and I would say
that the damage he does with a Staff of the Observers over the course of a
typical dark blue-con fight (solo) is equivalent to a couple of  extra DD
spells - a very worthwhile contribution to the fight and the staff of course
has 5 wis and 30 mana as well. Naturally, were he to group then my druid
wouldn't be tanking, but as a soloist meleeing not only remains viable much
much longer than most give credit for but it also makes a vital contribution
to the fight.

Moreover, aren't the non-meleers missing something? The great advantage of
the druid's snare line as compared with say the shaman's (and others') root
is that once the mob turns to flee he doesn't hit back. Please tell me you
don't waste mana on the mob at that stage! Hit the darned thing, it won't
hit back! Keep your atk, offence and weapon skills maxed so you're doing the
maximum damage in the minimum time. Also, keep meleeing as long as you
possibly can, as you'll keep your defence maxed that way.

Of course I'm not saying druids can melee to 60 necessarily and certainly
not as a prime part of combat, but to suggest stopping by 19 is absurd.
