Someone posted that transfers are actually done using a hand carried floppy
from one server to another. I haven't personally verified this, sounds like
it could be true.

Just looking at what would be involved if they are the least bit
concientious about it. First up they probably run the credit card through to
see if the charges will fly. Next they pull out a blank floppy and label it
appropriately. They then go to the 'from' server and verify that all
equipment has been removed from the character. At this stage they probably
lock out the character such that the owner can't hand off something at the
last second to dupe it.

Soon as the original server/character is buttoned up, they then move the
character via the floppy to the new server. Once on the new server I imagine
they again do a character check to make sure they didn't accidentally create
a character with 55,000 dex.

I doubt if the process ends there, VI may actually notify the person that
the transfer has been completed. In any case, they probably file the floppy
until verification the transfer has gone smoothly before they trash it. Upon
notification by the subscriber that the transfer went ok, they probaby burn
the character on the orignal server and scatter salt on the ground around
the ashes.

I'm not really an anal retentive person. That doesn't mean I don't love and
respect people that are when it is appropriate. VI has a tendancy to be AR
and it is both appropriate and respected<by me> in this case. They probably
have a big filing cabinet somewhere in a nuclear bomb shelter for storing
these floppies "just in case".
