Hi,

Is there any place I can download the updates to my files for my brand
new EQ2 I bought today? The downloading from within the program seems
not to work very well, it downloads a couple of files and then
cancels. 

I can't understand why they have designed it like that, it would be
better to download updates like microsoft does with their auto update.

It is very annoying not being able to play directly after buying a
game.
