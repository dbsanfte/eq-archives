Hmm how much ram do you have? 98 has weird problems with more than 512 mb,
though I think the symptoms would be different.

Oh CIHY9800Pro? ^_-

A 4200 is certainly an adequate card, even if I despise the company.
(Understand I'm not an ATI fanboy, I'm a nVidia despiser. There's a large
difference.)

At least your problem is solved. I'd say see you in game, but we play
different games, so oh well. Have fun. I've been on the flipside with a
friend for nearly 2 months now. His turbo-jet equipped nVidia card which
'kicks 4+! 4$$ (ati ass)...' and makes a horrible racket, to boot, is having
some weird conniption fit with his system. I think it's a video card/mb
incompatibility myself, but can't get him to use the old 8500 I loaned him,
which has worked flawlessly in UT, for more than 20 min. And of course, he
won't buy a new card cause his is u83r (uber).
