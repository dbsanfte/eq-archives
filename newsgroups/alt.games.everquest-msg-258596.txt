Odus:
Paineel, Hole, Warrens, & Stonebrunt are not original zones.

I can't remember if Kerra Island (the zone) not the little island in 
Erud's crossing is original. I think it might be, but not 100% sure.

Antonica:
JaggedPine is not an original zone.
Cazic Thule and Split Paw were revamped. Feerott was significantly 
impacted by Cazic Thule revamp.

I suppose one should also note that:
Innothule Swamp and Grobb/Gukta, and NeriakFQ were revamped (when loy 
moved the trolls)

Faydwer:
No adds iirc.
