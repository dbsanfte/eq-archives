>DO check out Crushbone.

I loved Crushbone both times I have had characters in the level range. A 
very fun place and always found a group if I wanted it, which I rarely 
did.  I spent a happy evening grouped in the throne room when I had my 
old Paladin and was so pleased when we cleared the named mobs.

Then recently I went to help someone there and popped into their again 
with my druid, found the names all present and correct and dropped them 
with one cast.  That put things into perspective ;)

  I agree with the comment regarding Paludal too, for what my opinion is 
worth.  My druid spent one level there, just to get to my next spell 
level then I cleared out.  Horrible place.  Far too many doodz who don't 
know what they are doing, not realising they are not learning the skills 
they will need later in life and squabbling over camps.
