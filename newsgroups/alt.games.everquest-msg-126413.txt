On Morell Thule, the current system is

/join auctions:auctions

Go on about your business while monitoring the channel for WTB
and occaisionally ( much more rarely than in EC where people
move thru the zone frequently ) auctioning your  stuff.

Leave channel whenever it looks repetitive or you get busy.

Problem with this is that you need to work harder to arrange
delivery, its no longer "second torch" time...

Other problem is its mostly the higher end stuff... which is
fine if thats what you have in mind or in hand... but you
aren't selling to the lowbie audience or going to find many
lowbie items there.  Maybe there should be a channel
/join cheap:cheap for those of us not willing to drop 20Kpp
to outfit an alt.
