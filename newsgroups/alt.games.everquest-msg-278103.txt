I executed my /movelog a couple of days after my server, Saryrn, merged 
with Mith Marr, and it was completed in just a couple of days.

That said, I think that was only like the fourth merger or so, and I 
imagine that the move requests are piling up with each subsequent server 
merge, possibly faster than they can carry them out. 

Several weeks though? That is longer than I would have expected. I'd 
probably try petitioning or sending an email to customer service at this 
point.
