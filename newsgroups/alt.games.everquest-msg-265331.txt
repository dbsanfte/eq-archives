Not that I've seen.  I group mostly with strangers, and have had no trouble
getting a group, and have no hesitation about inviting someone lfg.

Debt is annoying, but not all that bad.  Personally, I'd be happier without xp
loss on death (debt and loss are the same thing, with slightly different
implementations), but ah well.

Even with the shared debt system, death isn't a big deal.  Getting back to
your spot often takes longer than recovering the xp debt, even for a full
group wipe.  

It does suck to have someone who dies unnecessarily, though.  people who can't
seem to sit still and always manage to aggro the gnoll that everyone else
sneaked past may find themselves less welcome in groups.  Or maybe not - it's
likely to have a large enough population that you won't know most of the
people you group with, for the first year or so at least.
