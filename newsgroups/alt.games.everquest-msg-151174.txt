Unless your comp had trouble handling Luclin. :-( Grimling was second
in screen lag on my computer only to Shar Vahl.

It's not COMPLETELY safe at the zone in, because I died there once. My
own fault completely. First time I had ever ported into Grimling. No
idea where the portin spot was. Zoned in and as usual casted
doggieform immediately. The royal guards don't like dogs.

I probably would have been able to escape, but the framerate was so
bad I couldn't move fast enough. Oh well. :-) It might have been a
blessing in disguise, it meant my body could be dragged to acrylia
rather than me having to fight through the slideshow. Got rezzed at
the zoneline.
