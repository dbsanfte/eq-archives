Bingo! *That's* who that was! You caught me at a bad time to chat, since
I was naked at my bind point waiting for a rez. (We'd just gotten an
"add" of the corrupted seafury cyclops, and I had to take one for the
team to allow the rogue and cleric to camp out.) I was talking to them
in /tells saying, "Who's this Witte person talking to me?", but it was
all happening too fast. Sorry if I was short in the conversation
department.
  Strangely enough, I never associated you in my mind with the Povar
Artisans guild. I contacted a random member of your guild last night and
was, in fact, given the name of Friedrich to call for my jewelry needs,
but he/she was not online when I checked.
  Should you talk to them first, I'm looking for fire and cold resist
bracers and rings. I *think* the bracers are enchanted gold with fire
opals and peridots respectively, and the rings, enchanted vellium.
Haven't decided on a face slot item yet, but was going to ask the advice
of a jewler.
  The jury's still out on whether or not I'm going to replace my jagged
bands with wedding rings for the same AC and three less strenth just to
get an extra 65 hit points each. Probably not. But I definitely want to
beef up my resist gear before the next Vox/Naggy raids. I'm really tired
of the damage they lay out, and if I can resist a few, that's all the
better. Please let Friedrich know I'll be coming a'calling.
:-)
