The most interesting aspect of EQ2 for me, will be what is NOT in the
game (spell lines, items, or classes that are balance and coding
headaches or flat out discourage RP), and how mudflation and
camping/grinding are addressed. That is what will make or break EQ2
for me. A better looking EQ1 won't cut it. EQ2 will have to
revolutionize play The Kill-Loot-Sell model of advancement is getting
old. Alternate forms of advancement, real tradeskill/merchant
oppurtunities/occupations, and a persistent world that encourages
roleplay through content and not restrictive game mechanics is what I
hope to see.  After 3+ years I am sure most of us will burn out or
lose interest very quickly once the "wow" factor of the new eye-candy
wears off (assuming the majority of current EQ players even bother to
pick up EQ2 and try it).
