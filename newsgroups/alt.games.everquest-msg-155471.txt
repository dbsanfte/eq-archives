With the new Nerf to Monk you might be in trouble with the Cleric/Monk combo
but The Hole Entrance Hallway is good exp. If your Cleric is a Dwarf or
Halfling (Brell deity) they are safe for the most part heals don't seem to
draw Agro or faction hits.
Eastern Wastelands is another good Spot for low 50s, or the Bird house in
TD.
