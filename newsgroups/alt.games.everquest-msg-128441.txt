 In the meantime, if I come across the words again I'll just beg a high

tried making it once , after buying words , especially words of allure which
i can't ever seem to find, and it failed . Then after much searching etc, I
got  the words I needed again. After buying allure from a 46 necro, I asked
him to make the spell for me. Well, he failed too!! I am using a light blue
pet now most of the time. Still missing that third word, not that I want to
try this again and fail. Today or tomorrow I will be level 26, and still
using baby pet. Bah
