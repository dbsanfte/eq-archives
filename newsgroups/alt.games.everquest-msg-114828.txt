Guess you miss the beginning of Lokari's post...  You know... The part
about Kuledelanthehated...  You know...  The bad name in which he was
considered 'rude' for.

I kind of agree with Lokari...  If someone isn't going to take the time to
read some of the rules, and puts up intentionally bad names, like Mr. K
here and another person, like Ovarian Sist...  Then yeah... contempt is
going to be there from people who are trying to play the game within the
rules.

Bizbee also pointed out that he doesn't want to go moving spells around to
go buff a bunch of people, remem spells, then remem them again to buff the
dozen or so other requests.  The thing most or some of these beggars are
doing, is treating Druids and other high level casters as their own
personal buffing stations.  A lot of us have gotten to where we are by
either scratching our way up through our own merits or getting help from
higher ups when they deemed it necessary, not when we have.

Lokari, for instance, has put up a tailoring guide on her own time and from
her own experiments and support from other people.  It isn't REQUIRED for
her to do it, nor anything else.  Just as I have my own druid, I twinked up
a friend of mine with Banded armor and buffed her up to help her along, not
because she asked for it, but because I wanted to help her along.  I help
other people along when I feel like it, but when a person comes up, while I
am doing something else, and treats me like "Hey, it's a game, you should
help me out cause I asked."  Thing is...  It is a game, I am not obligated
to help you unless I feel like it as well.

I already ranted how I get /rudes from green players when I refuse to do
something for them, especially when they are /anoned.  I will answer
questions when I have time (Like when I am not kiting something.)  But I
refuse to be considered a buffing station for some lowbie or some kind of
guard to save a lowbie from his own fights, especially when I am camping
something.

Personally, Lokari is within her rights to tell the guy to get a real name.
