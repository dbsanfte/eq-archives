I have reread this post several times and do not see me calling anyone
childish.  I have pointed out that complaining about a rule that
requires you to be mature is in my eyes immature.  Perhaps that is what
bothered  you?  That is not the same as calling someone childish.

Again, this is not a rule that needs to be changed.  If you want to
stand up and protest for women's rights, or men's rights or gay rights
or albino rights I say more power to you.  If you want to stand up and
protest for the rights of the immature I'll have to snicker instead. 
Again, the world is full  of outlets for immaturity.  Why does
everything have to be reduced to such a level?
