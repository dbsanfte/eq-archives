Good luck. I had the unfortunate incident of dying moments before
beginning a cross-country move, so by the time I was all set up again,
my corpse had decayed. I ended up sitting in the Nexus (before PoP
came out) on a saturday night, logged in completely (AFK when not at
the computer) with a petition in queue; didn't get a reply till
freakin' tuesday. And even then I got the runaround, as it was just a
poor guide (who didn't have the necessary capabilities to rectify the
situation) and not an actual GM.

/em still bitter over that...
