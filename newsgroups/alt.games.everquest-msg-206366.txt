Hmmm...I wonder what it's like if someone gets that as their first EQ?  Here
are some questions/observations that come to mind.

1. I assume their account is enabled for levels 51-60?  It would be kind of
silly if they got the original EQ account levels (1-50) plus the PoP levels
(61-65).

2. Do they get the new models?

3. Is there still an old interface, or does everyone have the Velious
interface now?

4. After leveling up in the original EQ world (plus the free zones), will
they be high enough/equipped well enough for PoP?  (Remember, no Bazaar for
them to buy stuff in)
