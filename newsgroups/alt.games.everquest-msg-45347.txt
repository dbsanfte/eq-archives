ES gloves are a waste of money and a slot. We have ensnare which lasts
forever and is only like 30 mana. I've never understood someone trying
to sell the gloves for 1 k, I was like "you'd have to give me those
gloves along with a t-shirt and a bowl of soup for me to take them off
your hands." Its really better to have lowly splitpaw hide gloves on
instead until you get better gloves like coldain ones. I'd rather
ensnare something ONCE using mana than use those gloves over and over.

I'd never buy the es boots either.. jeez 3k???? We also have lev so
that is another waste of money. If you'd spend 3k you may as well get
GEBS for the often advertised 6k. Jeez yeah just checked.. all they do
is levitate.. bleah. I save the 3k on those and buy unlimited batwings
instead from the erud lady in East commons which is rather close to
our wc TP. All of these ES things have to be worn to be used also.

The only ES item I found worth using, and still use at level 55, are
the ES vambs. They are nice for a free extra dot and you can snare
then root something and actually med up while its dying doing free
damage. I still do that in wakening on sentient armors mixing it with
the level 53 dot and doing both at once sometimes,  so that when one
dies I'm ready for next.
