Not desiring to read your drivel is not at all misguided. Taking steps
to avoid it is not at all misguided.

It looks very much to me like you just saw an opportunity to join up
with some other Bizbee haters in further disrupting this news group.

You do that, but you'll never find me telling a whole newsgroup that
they're not allowed to participate in a thread.

Riiiiight. Sure. Pull the other one. Surely not even you believe that
line of crap.

>You, too, reside in killfiles.

I don't doubt it, and I don't care. If someone doesn't want to read
what I post, I certainly don't think they should have to. Nor do I
change my screen name for the purpose of breaking out of their kill
files.

So does your obvious and never-ending fascination with him. If you
actually cared about this newsgroup, even a tiny little bit, you'd do
something that actually helped the problem. Like ignoring him and not
taking constant shots at him.
