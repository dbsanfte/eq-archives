I'm a cleric and i always ask my group before i do a rez.  I only do it when
we have slow pulls, lots of downtime or people that are AFK.   The few times
that i got paid i did split it with the group.  The looks of shock and
suprised tells made up for any down time.  I figure if i should benifit from
it everyone should.
