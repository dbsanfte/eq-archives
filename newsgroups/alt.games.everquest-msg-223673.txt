Now, suppose you had code that you had to send to your company.  10
employees, for discussion's sake.  No standardized hardware or OS
requirements.  You're writing code on a Win2K Pro box, and when you test it,
it works just fine.  You ship it, and it blows up on one old Win95 machine,
2 of the 3 Win98 machines (one of those being a laptop), but works fine on
the rest.

Based on the reports you're getting as the designer, you think, "Well Win95
and Win98 aren't that much different.  Maybe it's an old OS issue.".

So you go to your users.

After much weeping and gnashing of teeth, you discover that the only thing
these three boxes have in common is that their users had installed a small
widget to pull down the local time and temp.

You had no way of knowing that the users had installed some little weather
forcasting widget, and since you didn't have one on your Win2K Pro box, you
had no way to test for it.

Multiply that by 10,000 or so and take it worldwide so that you can't visit
your users individually and that's what they're up against.

In my job, I put code out for 38 hospitals, from upstate New York to
Arizona.  Do it all from my home office.  My code will hit every workstation
in every hospital.  I understand exactly what they go through, because I go
through it myself.  Maybe that's why I tend to cut 'em some slack.  I'm
quite sure that they dread patch day more than we do.
