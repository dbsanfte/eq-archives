I have just ordered:

EverQuest: Gold Edition UK

Which I have read includes:

(EverQuest + the Ruins of Kunark + the Scars of Velious + the Shadows of
Luclin )

I have also seen:

EverQuest: the Planes of Power

Which it is said to include:

(EverQuest + the Planes of Power)


Now my question is will I also need to buy the EQ and PoP package or is that
the only one I need to buy? Or have I done the right thing by buying the
gold? (as it includes the expansions).

I have read that much of the PoP content is for higher levels (which I am
not), so dont mind waiting for a while until I get it, I understand with
Luclin I can transport myself to the bazaar which would help me immensley.

One other question, what is New Dawn? There are so many packages and
expansions for EQ it is quite confusing, especially for somebody new to the
game like me :)

Thanks for any replies.
