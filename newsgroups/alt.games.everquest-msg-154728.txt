I actually care more for the dirt poor balinese who copped it than the
westerners which is all the news reports are on about. They were just trying
to earn a living putting up with shit of drunken assholes.

Still - the people killed were from all over the world and my intention was
just to let folks know what had happened in case they had friends rely's
there as news was slow getting out at first.
