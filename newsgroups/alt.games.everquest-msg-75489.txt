Unlikely to get a pickup group, but for a cleric who knows.  The giants that
drop *plate* armor most often are in the Arena or by doing the "plate cycle"
for the 9th Coldain ring quest.  Both of those will require multiple groups
unless your group is good and/or mostly 60s.  In the Arena, Veterans seem to
have the best chance of dropping the good pieces, and are also the highest
level before getting to named giants.

Gems drop in Velks, Sirens Grotto, Dragon Necropolis and Thurg B.  Perhaps
other places, but you can farm them in those zones.
