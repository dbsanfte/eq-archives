That's the "(65-27/4)" part, the 65 is my level.  Notice the "-27"
corresponding to the cutoff for bigger damage bonus.

An exact formula is probably close to impossible unless you've actually got
access to the formulas through the code.

With the way EQ handles rounding of numbers that isn't entirely true, but
it's a good rule of thumb.

REBB = 42/28
Mithril Shod = 33/20
