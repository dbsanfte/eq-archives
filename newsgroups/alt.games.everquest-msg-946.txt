The healing song lasts as long as anthem.  There are some bard sites out
there with specific information about songs, but my bard is so casually
played he's only level 21 after about 18 months so I don't really care that
much about specific songs until I use them.

I do use healing and anthem together.  You can do healing, the DD song, and
anthem without losing anything but the single-pulse DD.  I haven't used the
level 2 AE damage song for a long time because I just assumed (perhaps
wrongly, I don't know) that it's not worth the time.  I DO know that any
enchanter in the group would have your head for playing it when they have
extra critters safely mezzed.

Keeping 4 songs juggled at once for a level 15 player for any length of time
is kind of hard to believe...sorry, bards are just too physically/mentally
hard to play at such a low level, even with a good computer and connection.

Just for background I've been playing EQ since 3/99, have a 47 druid, 46
enchanter, the 21 bard I mentioned, and 4 others with an average level of 20
(all different classes).  This isn't meant to impress...hell, what's
impressive about having no life?  It's just background.
