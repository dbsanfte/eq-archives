Here's your solution. She's already found a guild that interests her
and has spent some time with them - and the fact that they want her to
get more levels and get to know them first speaks only in their favor.
Tell her to say no thanks to all the other guild invites (which are
probably mostly from people trying to get together 10 random people
and start something new) and look more into this guild she is actually
interested in.
