    Being able to hear things happening in a remote part of the zone you're
in is a feature, not a bug. 8) It's scary how many people think you're
running ShowEQ when all you're doing is actually hearing when something
pops. "Spider up." "Wha? How did YOU know that?!?" And being able to call
out the deaths on a Velk raid without having to do a /who is also a blast.
