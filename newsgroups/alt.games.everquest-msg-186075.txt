First, I'm not real fond of Luclin as a concept.  Why not just have other
regions on the same planet?  I'm sure that's been beaten to death before,
but let's just say I'd rather see one world.  You should only be able to go
so far as your feet or your horse or boat can carry you.  Beyond that, you
have to earn your travel.  You can find a wizard willing to send you, or you
can pay at the wizard's guild.  Can't afford it?  Start walking or earn more
money.  There could even be quests to earn travel.  Want to go to another
continent but want to avoid the long boat trip?  Do a job for the Wizard's
guild and they will gate you there.

Cheers,
Eric
