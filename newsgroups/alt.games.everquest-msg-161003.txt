AoE requires AoE stun, or a cleric.  For rezing you all, because 30 mobs just
ate you for lunch.

I do think a lowbie AoE group would be fun to try, probably

chanter chanter cleric wizard wizard mage

You'd need two chanters because at low levels chanters don't have enough PBAE
stuns to keep the throng permamezed.

You'd need the cleric because you don't have overlap, so some mobs are going to
get a couple blows in due to resists... heck, even in the high end you need a
cleric for this reason, even best overlap plan lets a few blows thru from time
to time.   Low level group is going to have to keep the number of mobs killed
at one time much lower, due to the higher amount of slippage. Cleric also has
PBAE line to contribute some damage once you go to blowout mode

Wizards are the best PBAE damage producers, but you stick the mage in because
he's nearly as good, and gives you a tank to kill off the stragglers with at
the end.

I wonder what the minimum level would be to pull this off.
