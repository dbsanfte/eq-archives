Hrmm.  Meditate at 250 (with some AC and resists) or at
260 (minus a little total mana pool, AC, and resists) during
any downtime.   Yeah, I'd definitely go with the AC/resists
too.   Mana regen is highly over-rated, especially for druids
and clerics.  And they're too stupid to swap something that
increases their mana regen rate out for something with
resists when needed, anyway.

(Translation:  You're kidding, right?)
