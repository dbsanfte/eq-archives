I have always taken it that "buffing for donations" Requires a donation, 
but does not define an amount leaving it to the concious of the 
recipient how much they give.

"Buffing for free, donations accepted" means that you don't have to give 
them anything and can have a clean concious, but if you want 
extra-bonus-kama then give them something.

"Buffing for free" - means just that. Super-extra-bonus-karma if you try 
to donat, but watch out. The buffer will probably steal all your Karma 
by refusing the donation and giveing you a FS weapon <G>

"200pp for Kei, open a trade window for invite" is quite self 
explantory. I saw this on *FV* of all places (i'm not sure about the 
price but the implication is right)

Just IMOSH.
