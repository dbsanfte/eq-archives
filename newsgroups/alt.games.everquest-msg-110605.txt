Well, I guess it depends on your definition of perfection... Capitalism 
is fuelled by greed (not that I have a problem with that). If you remove 
greed from the equation, the whole house of cards collapses. Of course, 
if your definition of a perfect human is Gordon Gekko, then the system 
runs like a charm.

Not that I have a problem with Capitalism, per se. I'm entirely 
pragmatic: I'm a nerd, and Capitalism produces a lot more of the cool 
toys I crave than Communism does, hence, I prefer Capitalism.
