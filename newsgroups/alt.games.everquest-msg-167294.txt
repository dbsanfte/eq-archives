Clearing fear does *not* include CT, at least for us. There's a set of
guilds a tier above us who are in a constant race for CT on our server.
He has the lifespan of a fruitfly. However, the demi's are very nice
with some epic drops, etc. and we handle them easily. The dracho a bit
less so. We can barely kill Trak (always close, still wipe sometimes)
and we are nowhere near being able to handle CT. Maybe with another full
guild of allies with us, but we haven't tried.
