I have killed the DW goblins on top of the tower under the water for i cant
tell you how many hours.  No tainted has EVER spawned.  Then I read that I
will have to go through many tainted's before the right tainted spawns that
will spawn the corrupted.

Any help is greatly appreciated.  I am on the island where the tower is and
the magician and her pet inside, am swimming down and pulling the gobbies
from the tower underneath the island.

Thanks!
