That makes sense.  About then I got a Symphonic Saber.  I have yet to
receive a message that it procs, yet have this problem probably since I have
it.  Using a drum and no saber I have no problem, however in a group a using
this weapon with haste/slow/etc the proc must kill the casting bar and give
no message either.

Thanks!  That explains everything!
