OK, let  me educate you, since you seem to have trouble with the
definition of a "flame"

Flame: Originally, flame meant to carry forth in a passionate manner
in the spirit of honorable descent. Flames most often involved the use
of flowery language, clever insults, and witty repartï¿½. Flaming well
was an art form. More recently flame has come to refer to any kind of
derogatory comment no matter how witless or crude.

Now here are direct quotes from my posts that you insist on calling
"flames"

"You are more suited to giving "engrish" lessons, but keep trying."

"You are quick to use cliche barbs. Too bad you cannot back them up
with intelligent comments."

"No I do not have a problem. I disagree, and we are exchanging posts
over that fact. I guess things are just moving a little to fast for
you to keep up."

"I have not even begun to "start" with you. You are hardly worth the
effort. My reponse to you was hardly a flame. I doubt that you are up
to the challenge should you decide to engage in any real debate."

"Perhaps you should "just your mind" before you "spew
the standard reply of a clueless flamer""

If you still think that what I wrote in my posts were flames, then
there is little hope that you understand the concept. My guess is that
anyone who disagrees with you or quotes your own words back at you is
"flaming" you in your mind.

You cannot back up your original arguments or point, so there is no
point in further discussing the issues.
