Being able to hold it in either hand doesnt mean much since you cannot have
two of them. Some items which can replace the paw (and will at higher
levels) are: Cone of Mystics(5 WIS, 50 MANA), CGS (10 AC 9 WIS), Perl Kedge
Totem(18 WIS, -9 str), Elaborate Schmitar(9 WIS, 10 MANA, 5 poison,disease),
Dark Ember(5 wis, 20 mana, 2 str, 20 hp, 7 fire, effect: burn). I have never
seen a druid over 50 use a paw of appola before.
