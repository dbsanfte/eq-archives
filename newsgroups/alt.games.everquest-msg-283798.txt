I'm saying, people get fun in different ways.  How you want them to play
their class may not be how they want to have fun.

Necro's do insane DPS.

Yes, and good necro's in my book are ones who do massive DPS and use mind
wrack when they can.

Who mezz when the chanter is dead, or who slow undead when the slower is
busy, or who group heal when it's looking deadly or however many other
tricks they have.

When I play a necro, I mana feed people after their dead to help with
getting going quickly but I don't feed people while we're fighting.
Shaving 30 seconds off the mob's life is worth more than the mana a 59
necro could feed in the same time.
