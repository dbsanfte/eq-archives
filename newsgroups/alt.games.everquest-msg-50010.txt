If you'd told us *who* you were dealing with, it would have been a
specific warning. (although an unjust accusation, in my opinion.) If it
was only intended as a generic "watch out for scammers" post, then I was
wrong and I apologize. Though, with the level of detail you went into to
describe the specific actions of the individual, seeming to indicate
that this was a warning to the group to watch out for this *particular*
"scam", I would still say you were way off base. Either way... glad it
worked out for you, but there's enough legitimate scammers out there.
Try not to get so over the edge about a guy who likely made and honest
mistake and still completed an honest transaction. Hopefully you just
handled it politely in game with him. I'd hate to have somebody start
accusing me of that sort of action if I was only having connection
problems and/or hit a wrong key for a simple trade.
