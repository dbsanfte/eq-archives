[snip long argument]

Sorry.  It wasn't my intent to start a debate on whether the fully enhanced 
and expaned game is better or worse than the original. Obviously that's a 
matter of taste.  I was just wondering if there was anyone else who'd like 
to go back and play the orginal game with all its warts and problems, as 
opposed to playing the current version with all the changes and additions.

Why can't SOE simply create one server (I am sure they have archive software 
somewhere) and turn it up at the level of the game before Kunark?  Or even 
with Kunark?  I'd prefer without, but I'm somewhat flexible.

If such a server existed would any of you use it?
