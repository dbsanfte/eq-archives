Correct, it only lasts a short while, and does not fully stop a runner, and
has a high resist rate, which is generally a bad recipe for stopping a
fleeing mob :) The level 15 snare spell is much better, lasting long enough
for most fights and costing hardly any mana.

Rangers dont get a non-damage root until level 63 (earthen roots), so
helping out enchanters / bards / necros with CC is kinda risky until then, I
usually just chuck on a snare, until I hit 63 then can help a little more :)
