No, I'm not particularly committed to either camp on the nature vs. 
nurture question, but I lean toward it being some of each.  I have big 
problems with the idea that it may be genetic.  Mr. Wizzard sounded like 
he might be similarly opposed to the genetic case, and, since I was hoping 
to hear some good counter-arguments to it, I went that way.

}Nice tactic..
}"I don't *REALLY* believe that I just posted. I just wanted to spew.."

As I recall, I also actually said in the post that I was presenting this 
evidence in that light.  I'm sorry if trying to understand that strained 
your reading comprehension skills.

}Obviously you don't like speaking about what YOU believe in??
}Why is that?? DO you not have the strength of your convictions??
}Are you such a wimp that you won't even take a stand on your own
}beliefs??
}Just asking...

I do that plenty, in this very post even.  I merely wished to see a debate 
on that issue, because it is a scientific issue of some importance to me.  
My beliefs can be as strong as I want, and they won't change scientific 
facts, will they?

The REST of this post, however, stems from my own beliefs.  And it looks 
to me very much like I'm taking a stand.

}>I don't see any evasion of personal responsibilty going on.  I don't think

}You don't??
}"I don't really take responsibility for what I said because I don't

I do take responsibility for what I said.  When I want to spew, I wil say 
I want to spew.  I have not yet spewed.

}Are all the people in that EQ group as moronic as your's, Lesa's and
}BS's posts make you out to be???

If I say yes, will you stop crossposting there? :)

How nice that you're so intimatey acquainted with Mr. Wizzard's sexuality.

}Why am I not surprised..
}Or is this one of those things that is not really true either..

No, that's true.  I have, on several occasions, gone in drag in public.  
It's fun.

}Do you have a problem with taking a stand??

Not at all.

}>I was merely pointing out that this is not some sudden movement that

}>one of BS's posts that he can document it back about 400 years.
}Well, we all know that BS's posts are... well  BS...  Like yours.. By
}your own admission...

Funny, I've heard of most of the events he mentioned in that post.  Can 
you find us evidence that Oscar Wilde did not say such things at his 
trial, or that the book he cited is hooey, or that Stonewall never 
happened?  Or are you just spewing, yourself?

I never said my post was BS.  You are quite welcome to say so, but it 
doesn't realy help anything, you know.

}>Did you miss the part where I said I'm -not- gay?  It therefore follows 
}>that this is exactly the degree to which I would fight the cause under the

}But you also implied you wear dresses all over town...  So which is

These facts do not contradict.  Would it suprise you to know that a very 
large fraction of drag queens are hetero?  Girls make passes at boys who 
wear dresses.  Strange but true. :)
