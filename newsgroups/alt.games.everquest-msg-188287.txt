}I never said "all blacks". I specified "a place like Oakland". The Bay

}that, I can garauntee you you'll find enough of your stereotypical
}gangsta punks that you won't walk out of that bar.

Speaking as a former resident of about 12 different apartments in various 
parts of Oakland of varying degrees of "good neighborhood"-ness, you 
certainly have some funny ideas about my hometown, DT.  Bonker's 
predicted result is more or less accurate.  I certainly wouldn't recommend 
trying the experiment, though.  I can think of one incident similar to 
that that resulted in the most cop cars I've ever seen in one place 
before[*]... But then, that's because the situation escalated to where 
someone thought it'd be a bright idea to punch a cop.

Still, fatalities zero.  Kind of a shame, really.  It would be nice if 
people that clueless were actually removed from the gene pool, but oh 
well.

33 cop cars on one block, though.  Quite a sight to see.

    cheating. :)
