Melee misses don't count, I can't comment on dodges, ripostes, etc.  That's
my understanding - so if you're avoidance AC is already at the stage where
the mobs miss you, getting skillups becomes even harder.

That's why hugely twinked melee characters at low levels find it very hard
to get skill ups (I'm not suggesting this is the issue in your case, just
making a general comment), where-as toons with almost no AC at low levels
(as it was originally) get defense skill ups much more readily.

I don't know what your problem is, but I'll bet it's hard to pronounce.
