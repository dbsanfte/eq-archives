If you have Luclin then i suggest you head to Paladul caverns and try to get
someone to take you to the vah shir side.  Get in a group and fight
phlargs...they drop monk wearable armor that is light and has the same AC as
wu's without the stat bonuses...but they are common drops...great stuff in
that zone...it's right off of shadowhaven.
