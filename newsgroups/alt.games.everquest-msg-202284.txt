Assuming that the toon you buffed was on someone's hate list when you buffed
him, then, yeah, that would be why you took the hit (hate transfers when you
buff someone - if you're their friend, then you must be the mob's enemy so
to speak).

I can't recall what things fix that faction. If anything, I would think it
would be killing either poachers (doubt it) or, far more likely, the other
gnolls in the zone (darkpaw I believe they are).
