   He asked me to post this, since I tend to be more coherant a poster than
he is.  The question, best as I could understand it is:

   He installed a brand new hard drive onto my computer (xmas came
early!).  How would he Fdisk and format a hard drive on XP machine?  He'll
be the one reading the replies to this, so no need to try to keep the tech
level down to my fairly primative level.

  Thanks for any answers, gang.
