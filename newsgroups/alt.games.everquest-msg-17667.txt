Mesmerisation the AE Mez spell is exactly that, same as single target
mesmerise  but will stop a crowd of mobs and is useful when your puller runs
in with an overpull. AE mes then scarper.

Color Shift is a stun that will stun mobs around you for a few seconds. You
gain more in this line as you go along and with three memmed you can
effectively stand there cassting one after the other and providing there are
no resists keep the mobs around you stunned until you can bring the fight
under control. A useful tactic is to flux to stun then you have enough time
to mez a mob beating on you

I'm starting an ENC and upon reading the spell list I see Color Shift,
which is AE stun and Mesmerisation, which is also AE stun, beside
being at different levels, they seem to be of different lines as well,
can anyone enlighten me on the subject please?
