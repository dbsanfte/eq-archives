Yep ! I fall into that me to category you just described.

Of course which god I believe in gets a bit tricky when divorced from all
normal organized religious pursuits. There is also the possibility that
there is more than one ....

~ when you understand why you rejected all of the possible other gods and
only believe in this one you will unerstand why I believe in none at all . I
just believe in one less god than you do ... ~
