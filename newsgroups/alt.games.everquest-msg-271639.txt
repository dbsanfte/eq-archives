Oh come on. It's not always SoE's fault. I doubt WoW utilizes DX9. So
unless Transgaming programs a dx9 emulation layer EQ2 simply won't work.
Since it is running some of the newer games they even might have a dx9
port. But probably it isn't the full dx9 implementation. Add to this
that they have to rely on OpenGL to actually perform the gfx operations
the performance is lower than what you would get under windows.

Apparently this is a non issue with WoW but EQ2 would be a chore to play
under Linux I guess.
