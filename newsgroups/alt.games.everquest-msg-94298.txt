I would suggest PLing a rogue to 40 one weekend for that purpose, you can
probably get one of the intended druidic recipients of the reaver to help
also, level 40 rogues have a high enough lockpick cap that you can open the
doors in CoM, would probably work best if it's not on your account (since
you seem to be MA in most situations now =P) or Tiru's (CLERIC, DUH!), so
probably best to be on either a mule account (hey, who doesn't have one? =D)
or a trusted friend who doesn't care if you use his account.
