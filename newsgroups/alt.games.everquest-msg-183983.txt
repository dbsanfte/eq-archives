No.  I understand "skill" to refer to learned techniques.  To perform
brain surgery successfully requires mastery of a number of skills,
as well as a substantial body of knowledge required to diagnose
the need for, plan, and apply these skills to a specific case.
Nuclear physics is an extremely knowledge-based discipline, but
there are skills used in performing the tasks to which it applies.
Chess is an interesting example, to master it requires an incredible
amount of very arcane knowledge combined with similarly specific
pattern-recognition skills that you drill endlessly so that you can
apply your knowledge in a particular position of a particular game.
Come to think of it, if there is significant skill involved in EQ
I think it would be similar to the skill involved in chess:  the
trained ability to select the correct knowledge to apply to the
situation at hand under time constraint.  Competitive chess is played
with limited time available to each player.  "Blitz" chess is played
with very short time limits and is a valuable training aid as it is
important to not waste time considering positions that you already
understand and conserve your clock for those positions that require
thought.
