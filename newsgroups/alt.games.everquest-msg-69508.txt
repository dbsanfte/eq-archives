Not that I think Verant stinks, or the game is bad. I love it.

However, the problem recently occured that I couldn't get on because I didn'
have enough memory. Turning everything off or low didn't help either.

But when I started switching things on at ramdom. I found that sometimes it
worked.
For instance 640 res low texture doesn't work. But 800 med tex does, but not
with sound. Sound only works in 1200 med texture.

How weird is that. How bad is this game constructed anyway?
