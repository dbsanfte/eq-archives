I see you're from NSW and since you have ADSL I take it you're at least 
in the same timezone as me. I usually play with housemates and other 
friends of mine but we usually have trouble finding guilds and regular 
grouping members which play at around the same time as us, so we've 
started gathering fellow Australians on our server to get in touch with.

We play on Saryrn which does not seem overloaded at all to me. If you 
start on Saryrn then give us a yell by typing:

/join aussies
/list aussies
/chat 1 Hello!
