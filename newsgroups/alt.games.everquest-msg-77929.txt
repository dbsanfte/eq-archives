Hmmm... May I suggest a necro/necro combo? :)
Just gotta avoid magic-resistant mobs. But even with those
 - two pets whacking at a mob, with both necros having
pet heals up, and one pet left to recast one if the other went down...
Not efficient but might work...

What _does_ work rather cool is: Cast darkness - darkness
- darkness - fear - fear, in this order, if resisted:
Thus, if the puller gets resisted on darkness, he runs back to
the partner, which gets a snare off when mob comes in range.
Then, whoever got darkness through, casts fear, after the pets
have been send it, after fear just one dot, maybe two,
and everyone lifetaps to their liking, all the time dark-pacting.

This works really cool, especially when pets get their uber
regen at level 39, where they regenerate 3 per cent health
per tic!

But I must agree that necro/druid is a cool combo, as well
as necro/monk. I can only talk about necro-combos, because
my only other chars are lvl 15 and lvl 9, not much effort until
that point... :)
