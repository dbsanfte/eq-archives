Hey there,

I was looking for these 2 zones in my EQ directory since I wanted to
see if I had them before I did a cross-continent trip.  I didn't find
anything close to their names, so did they come in an expansion?

I was under the impression they were download-only.  (I did a complete
file check, and I am able to get to Jaggedpine.)

Thanks,

--sugarman--
