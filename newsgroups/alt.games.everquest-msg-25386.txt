Yes its possible, but it will be a pain in the ass.
You will have to kills a lot of mobs and do a lot of quests.

My advice is not to bother, you can level up fine on Kunark
up to 60. Plus with Velious all races start out pretty much on
even ground faction wise. So you have all of Velious and
Kunark to adventure in.
