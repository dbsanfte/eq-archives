Actually, I think WoW has better graphics.  EQ2 has more detailed character
models, but WoW's models are better animated, and WoW's landscapes are
better.  EQ2 shows that throwing a lot of polygons at things is not the way
to get the best looking graphics.

There seems to be something very inefficent about EQ2's graphics engine.
Even ignoring games like WoW, which go for a cartoonish/stylistic look which
doesn't require as many polygons, and just comparing to games that go for a
realistic look, EQ2 is very sluggish for what it does.  Compare to, say, the
Catacombs expansion for DAoC.  I think EQ2 has more detailed character
models, but for the rest, Catacombs looks better (more realistic) and
performs better.
