The monk / shaman is nice as others have pointed out. It seems to me,
though, that you are interested in traveling ( from your post ).  With the
ranger and Wiz you have tracking, DD, minor healing, and travel ( ports ).

I'm weak on what races can be what, but I was under the impression that
Humans can be just about everything but Shamen, so...

To get a mix like that, you could go with a Human Druid ( start in Qeynos? )
and an Erudian Mage ( Don't know if I've ever seen one, but I assume it's
possible ).  Decent DD, pet, SoW, Tracking later on, some healing, and
ports.

It wouldn't be your standard Dynamic Duo, but could be fun.  A little late
getting tracking, though.
