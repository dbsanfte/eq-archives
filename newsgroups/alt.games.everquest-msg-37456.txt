He apparently had a bad experience with Verant's CS.  His post was hardly
whiny.  He simply stated that he'll not buy another verant game because of
the (lack of) customer service.  Unlike some others, he didn't bitch or
carry on, just "good game, bad service, no repeat business."   It's his
money and opinion, let him have it.  (yes, I recognize the irony of asking
you to leave his opinion alone, yet dumping on you about yours -- deal with
it.  :-P)  I think you've got your troll labeler on High or something.
