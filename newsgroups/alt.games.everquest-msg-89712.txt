Jazz, after reading (and printing for future reference) everything you just
said and after reading what others have said, I have a question...

If you die for example just after you zone into the hole, how does your
corpse end up next to the big bad guy?  Obviously I've never been there...
but from what I'm gathering, I'm under the impression that no matter where
you die, you end up in a BAD spot...  Correct?

I had thought about just for fun, poking my head into the hole to look
around.  I have since rethought that... hehe

Thanks Jazz...
