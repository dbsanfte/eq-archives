Yeah, the last 15 or so points I've gotten without noticing just letting
myself be hit a few times while root/dotting.   I got 3 points off one
spider in CC back at level 40, I died, but I didn't care about the unrezzed
death because I saw my defense go up 3 points. (this is, incidentally, the
last time I actually SAW the skill raise)

Heh, I hope you don't take equipment suggestions as an insult, I'd trade
nearly all of my gear for one piece of yours (epic)

> Plat ruby veil

I've got an enshrouded veil from HS (7ac 2 wis 2 int 30 hp 30 mana 10 sv
fire all/all)
Mushroom veil from fungus grove seem popular and semi cheap, I prefer
hp/mana/saves to pure mana though.

I'm wearing the Enshrouded

> Othmir fur cap

I have no idea what the smeg to upgrade mine to outside of quest/planar
stuff.

> Shimmering slime necklace

I hate you.  But it doesn't have the clicky root like my Warden symbol (I
love that necklace)

> Earring of woven bark
> Earring of twisted leaves

Good stuff, hp/mana rocks.

Wearing twisted leaves and a pixie rib.

> 5th Coldain shawl

I hate you, 4 more biles to go.

Obulus Death Shroud here, will swap it out for 5th shawl though.

> Hierophant cloak

These are nice, but I personally like having a cloak with resists on it that
isn't worth an arm and a leg
(I've got a tattered hide cloak, 9 ac 6 sta 6 wis 55 hp/mana 8 sv disease,
dru/bst/mnk)

> Belt of the holy wanderer

Me too. =P

> Gloves of the earthcrafter

I hate you.  Have grey flesh gloves

> Plat jasper ring

Ouch, Shadel bandit ring, diamond wedding band, even velium jaspers if
nothing else (you should be able to solo the first two, though I bought
mine)

> Woven grass bracer

I hate you, I've just got dinky thurgadin (still better than ES arms though)

Does it have the 8 sec ES cast time or the 7.5 sec thurg bracer cast time or
something different?

> Vermiculated bracer

Good stuff, but I'm not sure if I'd switch my supple scale bracer for it or
not if I had the opportunity.

> Nathsar vambraces

Same here, contemplating switching to giant scalemail for more ac/hp though.
(stupid me already vendored one set of scalemail arms)

> Elysian tunic

I really really, REALLY hate you.  My Shroud of nature isn't bad, but I've
had it on forever and want to get rid of the leather BP look (don't even
suggest BCP for that, I hate those things)

> Black chitin leggings (yes, I said black chitin leggings)

Ummm.... ok.  Given that a 55 mage friend of mine just switched from these
to his thurg pants, I guess they're popular for some reason, I'll just keep
the Kromrifs that I know you had bad luck with.

> Coldain skin boots

Same.

> Seal of Thoridain

I got my seal/3rd shawl about 20 minutes before someone was selling a
Ceremonial Smudging stick for 1k, suffice it to say, he didn't have to
auction long.

Now I kill snow griffons for revenge and eat their eggs at the bank in
thurgadin. (or at least I would if the bastards ever dropped them, I've
never even SEEN a snow griff egg off of like 40 kills, a guildie had like 8
extra souffles that he MQed one for me)

> Naturewalkers scimitar

@)$*@)*)!&!!)&%^*@#)(%^

BURN DARK EMBER, ROT IN HELL YOU FLAMING PIECE OF CRAP!!

> Sarnak battle shield

Same.  ac/hp/saves =  WHEEE.

Bah, who needs resist gear when your hunting gear has good resists =P

Frog crown, ry'gorr cloak, kunzar cloak and 5 res all necklace is the sum
total of my resist gear.
55 magic/ 91 fire / 78 cold wearing normal hunting gear, 61/116/109 in
resist config (ry'gorr cloak)

To sum it up though, I'd trade you gear in an instant, followed immediatly
by going and doing some sort of massacre on crystal caverns and great
divide, and camping Shardwurm broodmother.

Ouch, that sucks a lot.
