}I get very upset when people think they're 'doing me a favor' (levels
}1 - 20ish mostly) by killing something at 1/2 health.  I need my
}combat skills raised, that's part of why I'm killing also.  If I want
}help, I'll /yell for it.

Sometimes, I get tired of being a 30th level enchanter or a 17th level 
wizard, and decide it'd be nice to be, say, a 1st level rogue.  And when I 
do that, I'm doing it specifically because I want to face those low-level 
challenges and dangers.  I want to risk my ass fighting a polar bear cub.  
If some high-level comes along and whacks my 49% health target to death, 
not only is he depriving me of a chance to raise skills, but he's also 
depriving me of exactly what I created this character to seek:  The sense 
of accomplishment in overcoming this particular mob by my little newbie 
self.  

Again, is it _really_ so hard to ask?  Or to wait until you find a newbie 
screaming for help to flex your muscles?

There was also a time when there was a weirdness about the faction 
system... if a mob gave more than one faction, sometimes one faction would 
'botttom out' before the other, and you'd need to reset it by allowing 
yourself to die to a mob on the bottomed-out faction.  I seem to recall it 
happening specifically with deathfist orcs and iksar monks trying to get 
Ashen Order to go up.  Whether or not that's actually how it worked, that 
was a prevailing theory. 

So here I am, trying to die to this mob, and some high-level comes along 
and rescues me without asking.  Great.  Thanks.

Also, make sure that 'newbie' you're rescuing hasn't put all his stuff in 
the bank so he can go for a warrior port. :)
