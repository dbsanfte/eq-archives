Hello.  I was wondering if any of you had any ideas for a place a 30th mage
could go to either group or solo.  I've been in High Keep for about 12
levels, and Im getting sick of it.  I've been to SK to fight gnolls, and
thats fine for a bit.  Any other ideas?  Also, I'd rather not go to loio
because I don't like that area much.

Thanks,
  Dak
