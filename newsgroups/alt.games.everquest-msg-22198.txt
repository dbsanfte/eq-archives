No, your root does damage, so it'll break mez if the enchanter just got
it to stick. If you're grouped with an enchanter you could swap it out
for your low level root I suppose.

No, all this time the enchanter is trying to stun/mez the mob and you'll
break mez when you hit it.

No, you'll break the mez the enchanter was getting on it before you
nuked. If you do this anyway and taunt it off the enchanter *don't*
attack the thing beating on you - let the enchanter mez it.

Probably the best bet. I wouldn't worry too much about the DS though -
an enchanter being hit enough to deal any significant damage with the
damage shield is dead already - they can only take a few hits. Healing
will aggro the mob though - heal until it turns on you then don't fight
back while the enchanter mezzes it.

Not really, I don't know what level you are, but at 30 I have

Nuke
main DoT
DS
Snare
Root
second DoT
Heal
Getaway spell (Evac in groups, Spirit of Cheetah solo)

I swap out the lower level DoT for buffing...

I'm guessing you're lower level and so only have one DoT worth
mentioning and no Evac/SoC...
