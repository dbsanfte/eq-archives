Back to the main topic of this thread - Shaman - they do get better as
you get higher level - for me from about 41-46 it was difficult - but
from then on I could solo as well as be effective in groups - maybe in
those low 40s I wasnt using the right tactics.

For each level above 40 I could solo but only in the right places -
from 45 onwards I mixed soloing in DL - based in the FV tunnel and
killing anything blue and group hunting in KC and the like.

I could make about a blue in 4 kills, I was killing them using a DOT
and then DDs.

At 49 the game changed and I was killing with EBolt and Plague - nice
new powerful DOTs.  Root, DOT sit ( rinse and repeat ).  I hunted to
51 in DL with side trips to kill in KC etc.  Most of the blues in DL
would be killed with one EBolt and one Plague - when stacked they do
about 200 pts damage per a tic - with Canni and chloro to regen mana
you can work your way through 49 and 50 in about 10-15 hours a piece
soloing.  I did 50 in a weekend.

At 51 you get a great slow spell and along with all the buff you have
you move from a would be nice to a must have in a group - you can buff
every one up and then slow the mobs to about 70-75% of their attack
speed.  They still do damage but at a quarter of the speed.

Last night I was involved in a break into Chardock for a raid - I was
one of three shaman there - the highest lvl 57 so I was not required
to slow all the time - I was buffing and the odd DOT spell.  We hit
the zone line and I was required to slow everything till it died and
the rest of the raid broke in. It was great fun on the raid - real
excting stuff - the shaman just keeps on getting better and better. 
The lvl 57 shaman to me that it was a pain on the higher level raids
as you are so busy - get yourself a Fungi Tunic and have Clarity 2 all
the time - as you will need all the mana you can get.  On the same
raid there were about 4 lvl 54 plus enchanters - they speed everyone
up we slow them down.
