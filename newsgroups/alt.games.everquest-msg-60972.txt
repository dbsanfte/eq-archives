For gods sake, WAIT on the Ghast quests. The rancerous Ghasts are level 
13-18, ONLY spawn at EQ night, usually see 0-2 a night. The hearts you 
need are rare drops.
I spend 3 RL days in Lfay to get the hearts (and im a druid, have wolf 
form to avoid brownies, and tracking to find the damn ghasts). You get a 
ok necklace for the quest, but dont get really interesting before you do 
the last quest.

Oh, and i just checked on Allakhazam, the necklace (at least the 3rd 
one) are druid and cleric only.
