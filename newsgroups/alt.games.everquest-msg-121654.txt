There's a load of new drops everywhere as far as I can see.  Orcs have
suddenly started dropping bricks of iron ore as a matter of routine.  And is
it just my imagination or have things been renamed a lot?  Instead of "bat"
we get myotis bat, whiskered bat, and so on.  Now rather than simple snakes
we have gopher snakes, grass snakes, thingummy snakes and whosit snakes...
Have these things been around all the time and I've just never seen them
before?
