What I do to raise my skills (at least at lower levels) is goto a group on a
camp and tell them you want to work your skills and you don't want exp
(don't group with them) when they pull just jump in and beat on the MOB's,
if your skills are lacking you shouldn't really aggro the MOB's,  Plus I
have one of those 2HS rapier's from Rivervale to help that skill, need to
get a shovel to work on 2HB.  Sure I could solo stuff to raise skills but I
will level faster than skills max.  This does 2 things 1) it raises your
skills. 2) it gives you a good reputation, many times when they have a bad
pull I can save the caster, if I switch in my better weapon and taunt.  Plus
to me it's not about leveling fastest, for this warrior I want to do it
right by maxing all skills before leveling.
