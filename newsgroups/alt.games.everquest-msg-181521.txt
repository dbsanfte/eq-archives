Well, by the sound of it, he wasn't the parent or guardian of the kids
in question, so that's irrelevant here.

I'll have to re-read that part, but, as I recall, that term only
allows for the parent/guardian to be the one paying for the account.
Seem to recall it saying something to the effect of they can let their
kid use the account as long as the kid is the only one using it. Could
be wrong, though.

I know no one pays attentiion to the no sharing rule, but it does have
consequences...
