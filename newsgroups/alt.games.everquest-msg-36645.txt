Hi,

My wife and I are both master bakers but she's hovering around 150 while I'm
at about 110.  We killed Nillipuss the other day.  We all rooted each other
but we out nuked him.  He hits hard too.  I heard he was about level 19 but
he was blue to me at 16.  Anyway, we got brownie parts and my wife did the
wedding cake recipe which makes 2 wedding cakes.  Is there any kind of
market for these or should we just munch?  If there is a market, any idea
what to ask?  Or just hold on to them until someone auctions for one and see
how much we get?  We don't spend much time in EC, but it might be worth a
special trip.  I think they're worth a lot but the wife doesn't.  Since the
age of the server might make a difference, we're on one of the newer
servers.

Thanks,

Lewis
