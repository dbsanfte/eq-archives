Yes. That is my next concern. I can get to 117 in Thurg easy enough. But
the question is WHERE to go where I can get everything for banded where
I'm not KOS? Grobb and Ogguk are apparently useless. The faction
nightmare for Shadowhaven looks daunting enough, though not nearly as
bad as Cabilis (arguably the best city for Smithing in the world). 
Freeport is supposed to be top notch for this, but it's the East/West
portions. Sadly, the folks of E/W Freeport have some issues with me
after a couple of dozen ummm... "unfortunate incidents" involving this
Lucan fellow....

Looking at the EQtraders supply locations pages isn't showing me
anything really promising, though Highpass and Highkeep are a
possibility, and only one zone apart. (I'm not KOS anywhere in that
area.)

If anybody knows the hot, single-zone places for making banded where I
won't be fending off guards and citizens every two minutes, please pass
it on.
