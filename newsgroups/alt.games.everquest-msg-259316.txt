It's somewhat counterintuitive but at your level, the stat that most
affects your mana regen is your Armor Class. If you aren't being hit,
it's all irrelevant anyway. If you are being hit; the less damage you
take, the faster you'll be able to canni back up to full mana. 

That starts to change at higher levels. Once you get heal spells that
are efficient enough heal your canni damage hitpoints suddenly gain in
importance. I was too high to play around with Stoicism when they
added that to the game but it's now (probably) the point where
hitpoints start to overshadow everything else when it comes to mana
regen.  At 65, with the right AAs and two LDoN augs, you can use
Quiessence to heal over 3k hitpoints for about 200 mana but if you
don't have the hitpoints to canni down that far, some of that heal is
going to waste. .... not that it really matters at that point since
the mana cost of Quiessence becomes almost irrelevant.
