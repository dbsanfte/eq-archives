Why try a new story? Mine hasn't changed. As far as I knew there was a
default zone ZEM. Not knowing this doesn't mean I don't know what a
ZEM means. Dumbass.

Shouldn't try to call a bluff when people are telling you its not a
bluff. I hope you realize you just got hopelessly pwned. Those threads
both have discussions that include ZEM references, and both have me
participating in them. I think they are both from a year ago, as well.

Irrelevant. The existance or nonexistance of ZEM doesn't have any
bearing on whether or not I knew what it was, only that I didn't know
its specifics. As has been pointed out again and again.

And apparently you've decided this is where you're going to make your
stand on penis size. Absolutely pathetic, in every way.

Guess what. I admit you knew the formula and I didn't. That was never
in question. The rest of your blather is still bullshit.

Wrong. The term in common usage refers to whether or not there's extra
experience to be gained in certain zones. Nobody talks about ZEM
unless they are talking about a zone that has a significant boost to
experience gained vs similar monsters in other zones; Hole elementals
vs random mobs in OT for example. If you don't understand that, you do
now.

Incorrect, again. You are arguing that because I don't know the exact
way to calculate weight on other planetary bodies, I therefore don't
know that I am lighter on the moon.

You are as inept with analogies as you are with English.

I'm so far ahead of you you've lost sight of my dust. You're still
whining about the formula. The formula is not the issue, no matter how
much you'd like it to be.

Ready to concede you were wrong and apologize for being an asshole
about it yet?

I'm not betting on it. You've put your credibility on the line, and
now you don't dare back down, even when the proof is provided with
links. Must suck to have so much of yourself wrapped up in this....

Either way, your posts aren't worth much to read anymore, with your
obsessive need to prove superiority even when shown to be wrong by
several people. However, I enjoy people making a fool of themselves,
so please continue for my enjoyment. :-)
