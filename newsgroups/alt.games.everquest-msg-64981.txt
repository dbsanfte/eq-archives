The truth is EQers are "hardcore" gamers whether they know it or not,
based on the hours played in a given month.

>>FPS players

SoL is more than just an "Expansion". Verants biggest mistake was in
marketing it as one. SoL should have been sold as "EQ1.5". The real
test will be whether or not people with older systems can still play
EQ without buying or running SoL.

>Pretty much agree here except with the harddrive and OS.

I was going for "min" specs. 10gb will get you an OS load and a couple
of games/apps. 

>And as for the OS, if you're a hardcore gamer, I wouldn't go any

My main point was to "NOT" be any lower than Win98.l Windows95 just
can't cut it for gaming anymore.

Cheers
