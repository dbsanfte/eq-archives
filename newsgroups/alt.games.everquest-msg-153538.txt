I am still waiting for 500aud worth of anime box sets to arrive from Amazon
which includes this series. It's taking a while because I chose the "send
everything together option - doh.

I have already upgraded the firmware on my DVD to make it all zone ; )

I refuse to by anything more in Australia because they are cut to shithouse
at the censors. When they change the format of the media it has to be
resubmitted and once it goes digital it has different criteria I suspect as
even the AU DVD version of Ninja Scroll I brought a few months ago was cut
to shit compared to the VHS one I brought a couple of years ago.

Our country is sooo fucked up censorship wise because a Rabid Christian
Nutcase holds the balance of power in the Senate and he has been given the
Communications portfolio. He is such a luddite he is on record saying
broadband is useless as it just let's people download porn and play games...
Sheesh.
