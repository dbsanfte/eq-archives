Nothing against Dell or to be pushing Clones, I do build my own computers I
just purchased one in Los Angeles area. P4 1.6ghz, Asus MB, 256mb Memory,
ATX case, 64meg Navida GForce Video card, 10/100 Net Card, Floppy, CD. for
$572.00 No Monitor Mouse or keyboard. If you know what to look for or know
someone Clones are the way to go.
