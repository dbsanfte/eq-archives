Starcraft had this feature years ago.  You can build the most powerful
units in Starcraft... and they are all defeated because your opponent
has a race-specific counter.  Furthermore, SC has very complementary
units... healers, short-range fighter, distance fighters... units that
can hide, units that can detect, etc etc etc.  Woe betide the player
who simply builds one set of units.

SC also was unique in that each race has very unique "feel".  The
zerg, humans and protoss certainly have different powers and
weaknesses.

I'd agree that the vast majority of RTS games are cookie-cutter, but
Warcraft II and Starcraft really stand out for me.
