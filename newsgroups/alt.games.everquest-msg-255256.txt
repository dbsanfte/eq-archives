I'm totally new to EQ so consider that when reading my response. I know 
you asked for old-timers but I figure I'll give you a new-timer's point 
of view.

I don't plan on jumping to EQII until it has been out at least 6 months. 
I'm obviously not terribly attached to EQ since I just started it but I 
am enjoying it immensely right now so I'm in no hurry to give that up 
for something like EQII which, if history is any indicator, will be full 
of bugs, problems, balancing issues, performance issues, etc. I'll 
happily wait until all that settles before I start paying money to play 
their game. I've learned my lesson there. (that is a slam on ALL MMORPGs 
really, not just EQ).

I will never play more than one MMORPG at a time.

I find it interesting too, but I think they had to do it to compete in 
the market. If they had stuck with EQ and all of its limitations, they'd 
be resting on their laurels and would eventually lose. My guess is that 
they hope to slowly let EQ atrophy down to a small handful of servers 
while EQII will take over the lead in the MMORPG market.

Not according to the FAQ.

Wait until it has been out. See what the community's reaction is and 
decide then. No reason to jump ship on day one and deal with the 
headaches that come with a new MMORPG.
