I tend to disagree, Jazz.  What they've done is something they've tended to
shy away from recently.  They've actually thrown a bone to folks who,
whether it be from preference or necessity, solo.  You don't have to be any
less proficient to play now than you did before, you just have more uptime.

Because of this change, last night I took a night off from AO, dusted off my
32 SK, and took him to ulthorks in EW.  Made about three yellows, not
because the XP there is any greater than it was at my other spot, but
becuase I had more uptime to kill.

I was actually hitting situations where the pull-determining factor wasn't
HP, but mana for taps, darkness, and fears.  In the past, if HT was down I'd
bind to 50 and either sit on my big ol' ogre butt until a greenie walked by
to tap, or by medding I got to 70.  Now, with the ability to bind to 70, all
I had to do was wait on mana.

My 2cp, fwiw. ;-)
