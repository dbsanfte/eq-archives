 Depends. I've been in many experience groups that have no downtime.
Whether you want to call it "standard" or not is up to you. For example,
a Monk and Shaman can pull non-stop for the most part. Slow+Togors
(Turgurs.. Whatever the healing one is called) + Cannibalize=Very few
med breaks. Add a cleric and enchanter in there and I see even less. Add
a rogue or another damage dealer and if you stop for med breaks I'd say
you're doing something wrong.

 There are less populated areas one can go and get basically unlimited
mobs. Howling Stones being one example I can think of. Sure, if you hit
the popular spots like Seb, Chardok, Velks, etc you're going to run out
of mobs. Akheva being one of the worse, really. Three groups can
basically keep every clear up to the worms down in the south/east hall
to the trapped room past the fallen pillar. Most people don't want to go
past that due to the increased number of annoying traps with the mind
worms being the worse for an XP group. I like Akheva but for the most
part Verant has it set up as a raid zone once you get so many people in
there.
