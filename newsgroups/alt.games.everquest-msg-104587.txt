    They kill him now. IV and THO are pretty contested spawns on my server,
with a lot of folks trying to bag them. Key word, trying. I wish there were
more Servitor of Luclin-type mobs in SoL - he seems to be perfect for
smaller or less-experienced guilds.

    ONLY ROGUES BEHIND IV. IF YOU GAIN AGGRO, DIE IN PLACE. ---- our
standard IV prep. If you follow that he's pretty easy. The biggest issue
really seems to be controlling the Rampage so you don't lose healers, and
guilds seem to figure that out quickly enough. Favourite IV hotkey, on one
of our troll main tanks: "Mother was right, I'M BLIND!"

    Yeah, this was the first time we went straight to him instead of
visiting the caves of EC bracers first. I was amazed at how short the trip
was, although that doesn't mean we didn't have folks getting lost and
running ahead of the leader. He's a fun fight - have to really get him
debuffed fast, but then he's a pussycat. And now I have a brand new purple
breastplate. :-)
