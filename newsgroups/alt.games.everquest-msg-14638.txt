It isn't impossible to split off a character from one account onto
another; just very unlikely. VI would need a compelling reason, such
as a husband/wife wanting to start their own account with the same
character.

If he's going to be playing with his friend (who played the character
to that level), he'll have all the guidance he needs. 

Rather a moot point, though. The character is *very* unlikely to be
moved to a new account, registered to someone other than the original
account owner or sharing the same surname.
