i know at least on the rathe thats how it is, everytime ive been in gd for a
ringwar it was announced, and also said that if you catch aggro die, and
there will be a 96% rezz provided  for you  and they sit in the zone
announcing there will be a ring war for a good 45mins before it starts
/shrug maybe the people who did the last few nights were asswipes, or you
simply missed the /ooc, /shouts
