My roommate and I work off of a single PPOE DSL connection. The telco is SBC
and the Ico is Earthlink. Neither company technically supports sharing the
connection and can't provide official tech assistance for it. However, our
current setup is working fine. The DSL-enhanced phone line comes into the
house, goes into the DSL modem. The DSL modem connects directly to a Linksys
10/100 Cable/DSL Router (~100-140usd). Cat5 connects each of our computers
to a port on the back of the router, we set some simple settings on the
router and on the computers (Linksys provided support for the setup) and
voila. We are both connected and cruising. She doesn't play EQ, but she's
usually online when I do.
Hope it helps!
