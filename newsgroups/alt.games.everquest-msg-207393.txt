What levels were they before?

Hmmm...just items with Spellshield, or also Spellshield from the
"Spellshield" spell?

Excellent.  I'd like to see a couple more camera changes now: (1) add a view
that is from the front (basically, just like the from-the-back view now, but
it is from the front), and (2) make the mouse controls better.

I don't know exactly what "better" would be...but for some reason, I find
the interaction between the camera and mouse and player movement in DAoC
just works a lot better than in EQ.  In DAoC, I have no trouble playing in
third person when I want, but in EQ I find it annoying, and go back to first
person.
