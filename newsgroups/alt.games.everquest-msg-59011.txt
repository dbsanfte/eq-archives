I see.
You would cast a buff that lasts for the same duration that increases
your caster's mana regen by 6 points vs. something that will make your
meleers generate upwards of 50% (or more) damage.

Let me clue you in right here and now:  Haste on melee has a far more
significant impact on your groups overall effectiveness than clarity.

The first order of business should ALWAYS be to haste the meleers--the
main tank and then the main damage generator (usually the rogue/monk)
and in that order.  And THEN you might consider claritying the main
healer/debuffer.

I hope you understand why that's a the wrong thing to do before you
get to the higher levels.

Melee is the only effective/efficient way to kill shit in this game.
EQ is *TOTALLY* melee centric.  You best figure that out before you
get to the higher level games where a fuckup tends to be significantly
more painful.
