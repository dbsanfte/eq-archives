OK,maybe my idea of an ISP is a little biased, BUT one thing I forgot to add
in my initial response to you was that the way they connect to the internet
is quite awkward.  It works for your average browsing needs, but for gaming
there is a lot of system and network overhead that's absent with "barebones"
ISP's.  AOL caters to many internet newbies, hey it was a good stepping
stone for me in learning to get around.
And no, I wasn't trying to start helping an AOL flamewar, hehe.  But as
someone who builds, upgrades, yada-yada for many clients, I have had many
people bring systems to me with every release of AOL the last 3 years.  The
reason being?  Mainstream use of the internet is still rather new and WE are
all the beta testers!
