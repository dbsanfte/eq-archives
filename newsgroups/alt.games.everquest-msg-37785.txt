Oh jesus, that fscking router in Atlanta was working on half a lung for so
long I thought I'd go insane.  Earthlink even denied having anything to do
with it at one point... until they fixed it and told me so.  Sigh.

It's been good lately, except, strangely, for two zones (that I've noticed):
Great Divide and Eastern Wastes.  *shrug*  Must be on a box that for some
reason I take a different route to.  Not many others in the zone notice it
when I ask.
