So, do you see this as morally equivalent as the Palestinians teaching their
kids to hate and kill Jews in their Koran and in their mosques? Ummm. No.

   Of course, on the other hand, most Arabs are

Let's say we withold funding from Israel, and cut them off with F-16
production etc. Do you think that Israel NOT retaliating will stop the
terrorists from doing homicide bombings? What planet do you live on?

Why didn't your "opressed" Palestinians do homicide bombings in Jordan when
the Weat Bank was part of Jordan (After Jordan annexed it after the war in
1948 when Israel was attacked?) The Jordanians slaughtered them and treated
them as the so called second class citizens that you are alluding to above,
yet there was nothing like what you see today.


 The US is currently providing Israel with a very

How about Barak ceding 97% of the West Bank to Arafat?

Again, why didn't they do this when Jordan had control of this land? It
isn't about poverty. It is about hatred.
