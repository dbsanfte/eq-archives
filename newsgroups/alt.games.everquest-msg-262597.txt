ROTFLMFAO

Having been a military dependant for most of my life, and the 
last almost 20 years now, the crappy mediacal care is nothing 
unusual. Thanks to the government chopping funding for most of 
the last 20 years, medical care has been getting worse the entire 
time. Most of my family and friends are military, and they will 
back me up. I can remember with a certain lack of fondness Dr 
Death - some unpronouncable hindi name, and had between 20 and 30 
malpractice suits active at any given time. I have been 
prescribed pennicillan despite the 3 inche letters and hot pink 
medical file indicating my allergy. I have been refused medical 
testing because the test I need to demonstrate an underlying 
medical condition isnt performed on base and they wont send me 
off base to get it. I have been accused of sitting on my ass 
eating chocolate candies as the reason I gained 150 lbs in a year 
[as a diabetic of over 20 years, I simply don't *do* candy, 
thanks.] I have seen them send my husband home from his boat with 
a 1 cm deep, 32 cm long unsutured gash on his head and told him 
to come back for sick call the next morning and they will see if 
he needs anything more. [luckily, I vetted my own animals and 
have lidocaine and suture kits around, and am very good at wound 
management.] I have, and everybody else I know have to check the 
expiration dates on our prepackaged meds things like birth 
control pills, contraceptive foam, cutelittle things like that. I 
even got a zithro pack that was a year expired] because they 
*will* give us past date items.

Welcome to My world, the world of Tri-care - called that because 
you try to get adequate medical care.  Did I mention it took them 
almost 4 years to put me into the diabetes control group....and I 
had been in one in our previous duty station...and we have to 
have copies of our medical records because they have lsot them 4 
times in 15 years...........
