I barely am interested enough to set my prices initially, now
you want me to go in and check 20 prices to see if they need
adjusting?

Not going to happen.  I'd rather go back to selling items to
vendor than work that hard!

Further, scammers are quite capable of deliberately manipulating
prices by listing items over the 30 item limit, but at very low
prices. Then when you follow suit to attempt to compete, they
come buy the item at your pricee.  Later they can put the item
up for sale at a real price, moving it down into the 30 item
buyable selection portion.

Since I'm both lazy and paranoid, doing nothing is a lot
better than checking a price that may be manipulated
