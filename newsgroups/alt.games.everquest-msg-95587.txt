Chances are, what everyone else said up to this point is correct.

However.

If you want to avoid accusations as a ninja looter (one who loots stuff
quickly that doesn't belong to them) keep a few things in mind:

- if there's a corpse and no one around...LOOT IT.
- if there's a corpse and a group is nearby working on killing other
critters then ask first...it could be that they just haven't had the time
yet to loot it.
- it never hurts to ask folks standing around there if they mind if you loot
the corpses that they don't.
- if you do loot and you can cast any buff (beneficial spell) at all, cast
it on the fighters.  Don't go overboard/oom, just a token thing to let them
know you appreciate the loot.  If you can't buff, don't worry about it, it's
just a nice touch.

Don't get the attitude that if it's been rotting long enough for you to loot
it then, damnit, you're perfectly within your rights to do so.  Although
technically true in most cases, it does make you a selfish asshole.

Anyway, again, what the others said is true, it's probably a twink that
doesn't give a crap about loot worth a few silver or gold or maybe even plat
but it doesn't hurt to be polite.
