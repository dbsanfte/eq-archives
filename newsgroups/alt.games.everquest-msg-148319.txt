Well, you are lvl 22. My monk is at 45 now and I can really see the
difference than playing just a plain nothing melee person. FD makes it
so you can basically exist anywhere and cross any distance without
getting killed unless you meet up with a bunch of spellcasters who
gang bang you. :p And as for the higher DPS the extra attack like
flying kick and eagle punch and stuff are suppose to represent a
special attack like on SF or MK. They really should add a lot more
options for all melee including monk though so they can do more solo
or at least just do more things. Then again my main is a high level
wizard and right off the bat I jammed a SCHW/Fungi Tunic/and 2 
KD's on him as soon as I got them and had a very very fun time going
from lvl 1 to 45. But now there's almost no places I can just go solo
and be very successful anymore, I guess I might be biast for
spellcasters since I've been playing a wizard so long that I just
don't like pulling or being melee in a group though. Ah well, I hope
they start making some mega gameplay changes soon or all the other
MMORPGs are gonna overrun EQ.
