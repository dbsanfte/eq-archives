 That group should be fine. The main reason you want a high level is
because they'll be able to pull one or two mobs at a time rather than
aggroing entire rooms. The North wing shouldn't be overly difficult
though.

 Average Harm Touch for a North Wing skeleton is probably 525 or so.
More or less depending on their level. Once you move to other wings that
starts going up. Most Undertakers (51 mobs) hit with a 800HP or so Harm
Touch. I have noticed with that latest patch that their HT are partially
resistable, but not very often.

 Obulations/Hamals/Helots are not a pullers friend. They are wizard mobs
and like to chain cast. Make sure resists are kept up.

 And as Ben says, watch out for pit traps. They are disguised as rugs.
There is one trap per wing. Get a map before going.
