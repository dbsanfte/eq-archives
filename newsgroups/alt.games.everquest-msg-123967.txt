Hi all,

I'm playing my ranger again.  Good fun, it's been a while since I meleed.
Anyway, I was using a frozen longsword (7/26) in primary and a combine
scimitar (5/25?) in offhand.  I'm level 17, BTW.

Anyway, after a trip to EC I'm now the proud owner of a Icetooth's claw
(11/29) and an icepaw war claw (9/24 agi+3).  Unfortunately, when I bought
them I didn't notice both were primary only.  I got the icetooth for 100pp
and the icepaw for 80pp if anyone was wondering.

My question, I guess I'll use the longsword in the offhand but which claw is
better in primary?  I'll do more damage with the icetooth's (2.63 vs. 2.66)
but the icepaw has extra agi.  With my feet like a cat and armor, my agi is
124.  The icepaw would make that 127, which only makes my ac go up by 1.
I'm thinking the icetooth as primary and icepaw as corpse run/backup weapon.

Not related, but I got my archery up to 78.  I occassionally critical hit
for > 50.  With snare and no sow, I bow kited a blue griffawn.  That was
fun!

Thanks,

Lewis
