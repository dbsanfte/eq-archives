I'd recommend you go for a GeForce4Ti4200 with 128mb for video. I have
both (Radeon 8500 and GF4ti4200), and the GF is faster overall and
handles zones like the Bazaar and Shadowhaven much better than the ATI
card.

If you are only going to run PC2100, then you are wasting your money
with a 333fsb board (which uses PC2700 memory to run at 333)

You might alse want to look in an nForce based motherboard. They have
superb sound built in (6chl...rivalling the SBLive! series), as well
as a built in 10/100 NIC. The Abit board also comes with IDE RAID. You
can find the Nforce boards for $75-100usd. The nForce boards have a
great reputation for stability and compatibility (they are not known
for overclocking if that is your aim). They also appear to handle PCI
latency much better. nForce users are getting much higher benchmark
scores on HDD data transfers than those using VIA KT266 boards.

Asus A7N266-C (Nvidia nForce 415)

ABIT NV7-133R (Nvidia nForce 415 1xAGP(4X)/5xPCI/3xDDR w/RAID, LAN &
AUDIO)
