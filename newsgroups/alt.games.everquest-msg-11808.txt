I guess you are a diciple of Alastair.  Alastair did his test before Kunark
was out, he fought greater kobolds that were mostly GREEN to low blue, he
was also completely buffed, with a pet and comparing himself to a solo
warrior with no buffs.  And remember, warriors skills back then max out at
level 40.  I have yet to see a test from him where he "tanks" a Kunark or
Velious MOB, probably because he was reduced to a red stain on the floor.

Slow doesn't prevent MOBs from quadding for 250 each, then toss in a flurry.
Slow is still very powerful though.
