No. The issue I'm seeking to resolve is whether there is a competency 
difference between competent players, when divided into raiders and non-
raiders.

Its a given that they are competent, that's the selection group. The 
question is whether the raiders are -more- competent.

There is no reason to include newbies in the sample.

No its more like 'lets see if Spanish speakers are more capable of 
solving complex problems than German speakers and restricting the sample 
set to university graduates. It makes sense to do that.

Spanish is the primary language in several 3rd world countries. To just 
include everyone who speaks spanish in the test is obviously not going 
to give you any insight into whether one language is more conducive to 
problem solving; it merely highlights the fact that more Spanish 
speakers than German have never seen a school and cant read. 

Similiarly, any result derived from comparing all raiders to all non-
raiders would merely highlight that newbies and people who play once a 
month are non raiders. We already know that, so lets move on, and 
determine whether non-raiders who are *not* casuals and newbies whether 
there is a competency difference with raiders.

> It makes no sense ;)

It makes perfect sense.
