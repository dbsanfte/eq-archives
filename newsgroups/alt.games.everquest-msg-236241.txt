This theory sounds as good as any.  This would suggest to that they could
adjust tribute values on a regular basis (hopefully, never again
retroactively), perhaps each adjustment leaving us with a new set of tribute
winners and losers, item-wise.  My regular group will need to be aware of
tribute value versus bazaar value for some of these "trash" LDoN drops.
It's probably better to have someone get 2K tribute points rather than
putting another pair of Slippers of Dark Mana on sale and having to really
discount them because there are 5+ other vendors also selling them.
