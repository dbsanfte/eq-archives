Because then a cleric can restore hours of work to you in
a matter of seconds.  Death is your meat and drink, young
cleric, and you'd best learn to enjoy supping with her now,
as you will soon be on a first name basis with the Lady.

The exp you lose now is as -nothing- to what you'll lose
at higher levels, where one unresed death can mean
several RL -days- of lost work.

In a couple levels, you will get revive, and noone will
really care much, although it can save significant time
to people who aren't bound near where they fight.  One
nice thing I didn't know, is that you can revive someone
without ruining their chance for an exp res; in fact I've
had paladins revive me, I med up, and res myself.

At 39, though, you get your 50% res, saving half the
lost time... people in their 30s and low 40s will be all
over you for this, although by 45 or so people will
be looking at this as a "time is running out" option, as
getting only half that lost time back becomes more
and more painful.

At 49 you hit the 90% res, and its a rare person who
will turn that down, as 56+ clerics or ones with their
epics are hard to come by, and the difference in
exp returned isn't all that large compared to the chance
of not getting a res at all.

I can't speak to 56 yet, but its a 96% res, which if
you think about it is 60% better than 90%... when
a blue bubble of exp means days of work, getting
an extra half a blue back may be more critical than
I think.

The Epic allows you to do the 96% res without spending
mana, the only factor there becomes the cycle time
on the thing.

You think he'll make it?
It'd take a miracle.
