Devalue u are acting like u bought a lot in beverly hills and they put a pig
farm next to u. So what if other players are able to make it faster than we
did. If this brings in new players that means more money for Verant and
maybe that means more items, more zones, more monsters. As far as unskilled
players go i have been from 1 to 60 and there are alot of unskilled high
lvls out there. Mostly because they forget this is just a game and there
egos get in the way. Just yesterday I was at a event and a 60 lvl was
screaming across ooc that everyone was suppose to listen to his instructions
or leave the zone. Hello wake up call. This patch will benfit all players
across the lvls. Sorry man I guess this gig is not for u.
