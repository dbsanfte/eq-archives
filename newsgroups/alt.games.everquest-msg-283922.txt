Indeed.  After my Expermint toon bravely attacked several guards in
North Qeynos (while bound in South), I found that the corpse shows
an X for your dead groupie's corpse on your map only if:

- you were grouped when he died and have not left
- you were in the zone when he died and have not left
- he hasn't zoned back in

So it's not a cure-all for lost corpses, but it will help in a lot of
cases.
