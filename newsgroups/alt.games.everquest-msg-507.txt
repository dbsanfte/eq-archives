THanks Gary.  I already had that printed. But thanks you anyway.  I was more
interested in the practise runes they were talking about.  I bought the 2 books
and read them and I was missing a piece of parchment paper and a quill. My new
question is :

There is 4 spots in the grimoire. To practice my first rune, I need:

bone chips
lapis Luzi
bat wing.

I did all 3 and got a message stating the amount I put in is not enough. so I'm
missing the parchment or the quill?  Hmm..


any assistance will be appreciated.

Al.
