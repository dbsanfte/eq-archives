It's more a factor of levels these days.
Try it, a level 60 warrior wearing full banded/bronze can pretty much
tank anything in the old world without problems.  Give him a pair of
yaks or any other sub-lamentation calibre weapons and he'll still beat
the shit out of any old world mob without problems.

Level plays such a huge role in EQ it simply cannot be overemphasized.

I remember the one time someone thought it was a great idea to have 40
people zone into Fear at the same time (note:  It's a VERY bad idea).
The subsequent comedy was CR done with level 60 warriors using
borrowed banded/bronze/crafted (with a handful in indocite) using old
world weapons.  One such group zoned into a fully popped Fear, clear
the west wall of all roamers with no (further) deaths.

The enchanter wearing borrowed gear (we're talking Oracle robes and
plat jade rings here...), was able to keep the whole collection of
roamers mezzed and stupid while the warrior/rogues just plowed through
them in no time flat.
