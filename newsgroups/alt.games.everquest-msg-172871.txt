I know a lot of people do this, but I'm hoping some of you have a little
time to make suggestions :) I'm a 55 wizard (and finding it awfully slow to
get any further on the XP treadmill :P), I have all the expansions, and I've
been quadding raptors in the Timorous Deep to move ahead.

I have about 2500 plat, and am part of a small family-style guild of people
who can usually get 1 good group of 50's-60's together. I'm thinking about
the Fetid Flesh Belt from Fungus Grove (possibly solo or pick-up? Have to
check it out.)

Any suggestions from the learned members of the group appreciated! I started
Everquest at the end of August, and think I've come pretty far 4 months :)
