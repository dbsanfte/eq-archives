Naww its never too late. Ive started new melee skills at 50+ without a
problem. Usually work on them if im not the Main Assist, and when it
does get hairy, ill switch to my better skill. Once you get your 1hs
up with your 2hs, be sure to work on both as you level up if possible.
Then grab some blunt weapons and work on them. The more skills you
have the better off you are.
