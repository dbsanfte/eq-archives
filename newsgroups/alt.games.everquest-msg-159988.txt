Hi all, I'm hoping someone can help me a bit here.
I just upgraded to an AMD 2100+ processor, sitting on an Asus A7V8X with
512mb DDR RAM and am having *serious* heat issues.....
I slap it together and turn it on.  Doesn't like either of my installed
o/s's anymore so I reformat win98 (for older games and old scanner) and
Win2k (which I use for everything else) then when it all seems to be working
I go to put the rest of the case together and find it is H-O-T!!!  I check
in the BIOS and it's almost 200 degrees.  I shut it down immediately,
thanking my lucky stars it isn't actually fried.
I read that this processor is a power-hog and might need at least a 300w
psu.  I thought I had 325, but it turns out it's only 235 so I bought a 400w
and it helped a bit, but it's still running 150+ degrees with no case and a
house fan on top and blowing straight down, about 3 inches from the
processor.  I removed the chip and added extra thermal paste just in case,
moved all cables and a hard-disk that was initially near it.  Nothing is in
the way, the breeze is blowing hard and it's still hot???  WTF??  No, I
haven't played with overclocking.  Actually it's set to less than it's max
allowed setting.  I'm freezing my ass off sitting next to my system yet it's
still hot.
How can I lower the temps?  Sure an extra fan wouldn't hurt, but as it
stands, there is no damn case on it and has a fan bigger than I can fit
sitting right on top of it anyway!

One other thing...EQ smokes!  Bring on the Bazaar!
However, when I launch EQ in Win98, I get as far as the character select
screen, click enter world and the system freezes.  Reboot and.....Win98
won't load anymore.  Reformatted 3 times just to see.  Other games work, but
something about either EQ or whatever is hosing 98.  Win2k doesn't do this.
