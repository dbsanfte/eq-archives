There is nothing wrong with XP farming, in fact, Whenever I find a good
XP farm, I'll stay till I'm done.  And if the loot is good, so much the
better.  Personally, I like the QH 3 Gnoll farming spots, as I can farm
both 3 spawns till they go green, then I go the the thug farm in Qeynos
sewers, and stay there till they green out. Move either 2 the two bandit
farm in West karana, or the smuggler farm, also in the sewers.

precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
