If you're getting "whumped in battle" your armor isn't the problem.
How are your tactics?

Split Paw, Ulthork, Tizmac, Gnome Skin, Studded, Reinforced, cultural
leathers, Foremans Tunic, Straw Spun Belt, Cloak of the Ice Bear,
Polar Bear Cloak, Prayer Cloth of Tunare, Braided Ivy Cords,
Gatorscale legs, are some possible armor upgrades that come to mind.
