When the server merges took place, low-level characters (1-9? 1-10?)
who had not been played for a long time (six months?) were deleted,
and others might have had their names changed if the name was in use
by a character with more "total play time" on the other server.  But
any of your higher level characters (11 and up, for sure) should still
be there.
