Since the July 10th & 11th patches, I now find that I am unable to
choose a character. Is anyone else finding this?

I can log in, select the server, it then completes loading the world and
then bing! "you are disconnected". Currently answering all the initial
usless questions SOE asks before they believe you know what you are
talking about.

Hint to SOE - pointing me at the StarWars FAQ page won't help me with
Everquest problems!
