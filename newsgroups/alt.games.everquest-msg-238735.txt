Was curious here if anyone else is somewhat disappointed with GoD. I play a
high end rogue who's been farming PoTime for a few months now, and I must
say, Gates of Discord isnt interesting in the least bit. The loot tables are
upgraded from Time and such, but their not that much of an upgrade. Over-all
the whole concept of expeditions is somewhat like PoP with their "flagging"
for higher and better zones. GoD just seems like a PoP v2.0  A lot of my
guild members feel the same way, then you have a few who enjoy it of course,
because its a change. I just think they could have done better with GoD
over-all instead of rushing it out. Doing 800 expeditions and trials to get
minorly upgraded loot seems worthless imo! Kod`Taz is a fun zone to explore
as a rogue and such but the mobs are horrible. You pratically got to have an
11k tank with 2k+ ac to even do these mobs. Sorry for wasting your time just
felt like ranting a bit about GoD and here seemed to be a good place =) Have
a good day.
