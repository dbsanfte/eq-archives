LOL, Bigger than 19", no thanks, I like not having to sit 7 feet away.  I will
try playing in the 1024 mode though and see if that helps the situation.  I
tried going to that website but it came up error 404 or something.  I'll
bookmark it and try again later though. 
    Thanks everyone for the information, I will try and adjust the colors to at
least fix HALF of my problem.  The only reason I am fighting to learn this mode
is because I think I read in a post that with LUCLIN the half screen mode will
be eliminated, or something like that.  Don't quote me because I'm not sure,
and quite frankly it's a better mode anyway.
