What environment?  What player interaction?
I started playing in January 2000 on Tholuxe Paells.  Even without the port
stones very few people took the boats.  *I* did because I was a poor newbie and
simply couldn't afford a port.  No one ran through Qeynos offering them for 10
plat, and quite frankly, I was a little scared to have someone port me, (I was
around level 20 before I got my first port).  
I have made many, many, boat trips.  I always left my belongings in the bank
because I'd heard all the horrible corpse problems due to boat problems, so at
least I have none of those stories.  I have fallen off the boat, that sucked.  
I have had "lag" that caused me to miss the second boat.  Sucked even more. 
That was a 2 hour loss, minimum.  By the time I got to where I was going, I was
so frustrated I literally dropped to the dock, (in Fironie Vie), and kissed the
ground.  The players waiting to get on the boat laughed their fool heads off. 
Then I logged off, because my whole night was gone.
This would be another instance where I *don't* think the *old days* were always
the *good old days*.
