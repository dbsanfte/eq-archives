I've died twice in Antonica in places surrounded by enemies.  There is no 
way for me to survive re-entering those places to retrieve my shard.  I 
don't care about how long it takes me to regain my spirits.  Is there a way 
to delete my shard recovery quests?  If not, how long will it take for me to 
regain my  two spirits?

Thanks in advance.

David S.
