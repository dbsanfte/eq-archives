Interesting observation you include about UO.  I left after almost 4 years
because they've turned it into a 'short-bus' game, if you will.  I mean, I'm
not a masochist because I like some challenge - which EQ has.  UO OTOH, has
been made into a game challenging to only the weakest 3rd grade mind and
that's normally who you'll find logged in any more.
