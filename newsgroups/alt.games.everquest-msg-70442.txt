  If you're running on a system that currently uses Windows 95, I'd
think your system might choke if you tried running XP on it.  Also,
you can't upgrade from Windows 95 to XP, you have to purchase the full
version of the software ($200 retail) or an OEM copy (closer to $100,
but it requires a hardware purchase... at this point, you almost might
as well just buy a new system).

  It doesn't exactly take of ton of effort to spam a newsgroup and put
up a web petition, heh. :P

  My system is actually very similar to yours, except I have a VooDoo3
3000.  I am experiencing some problems (unplayably bad frame rates in
some zones, most notably Freeport and probably just about any Kunark
zone... haven't tested them yet)... also, sometimes, out of the blue,
frame rates will drop to 1-2 FPS seemingly out of nowhere... I suspect
there's a memory leak they haven't tracked down yet.  Yesterday I was
doing a language lesson (on Firiona Vie, where you have to zone back
and forth because you can get 1 pt increase per zone) and I had zoned
back and forth between Oasis and N. Ro several times without a
problem, frame rates were fine... then suddenly I zoned in to Oasis,
and the frame rates were so bad I could barely type.

  So right now I'd describe my playability as borderline.  I can play,
but I have to sit out certain activities because my system will choke.

  You say your Pentium II 350 with 256 RAM is able to handle Windows
XP?  It only barely meets the minimum requirements, I would have
presumed performance would be terrible, especially in games.  Maybe I
should've bought an OEM copy of XP and a new hard drive afterall.
