Yeah the ancient croc drops the arms A LOT, the legs are rare.

You said low end, so I bet you don't have an ivandyrs hoop. Its easier
to get than you think. I got it the first time on the 2nd ruby and
another on the 12th or so so figure I got two of them for the price of
14 rubies. With good charisma stuff rubies are not that bad and
players sell them for more than that. Its wearable by any race which
has a class that can be evil so necro covers it. You find lynuga the
troll a ways out from guk and start giving her rubies until you get
it.
