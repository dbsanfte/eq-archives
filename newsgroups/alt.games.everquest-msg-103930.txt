MagnumLeopard@webtv.net digested the following thoughts and produced

I have never been there much less digested that. I don't eat or digest
teenagers. It is illegal.

I have been there, but I never thought to eat Spain, much less digest
that. How does it taste?

>     A man quits his college classes and stays in his apartment playing

Ewww. I have never eaten a man much less digested him. People often
stay in apartments watching..... hmmm... webtv?

> 
>     A pizza hut guy kills himself after drenching his mind in the EQ

Pizza? Yes! Digested many times, but I prefer the taste of the pizza
than the delivery person. I did have a girlfriend who was a delivery
girl, but never digested her.

>    I dont expect anything here is going to make someone stop playing EQ.

Ok, I met your expectations. Now I don't have to worry that you are
going to come after me in a webtv induced rage and try to digest me.

> I don't think anything on earth could....if you work at taco bell, have

I have digested food at Taco bell, but not the Earth. It is... well...
too big.

> mediocore eyesight, a junky car, and draw snickers from the opposite sex

Never digested a mediocore what is it? Do you mean media corte, the
Tango dance step?

Does a mediocore have to be cooked? 

No on junky cars. I have digested snickers though.

No I am just dissatisfied that I am missing out on these things to
digest. My wife always snickers at me. Does en't yours? No? You are
not married are you, I can tell.

Why, I thought this was about digestion.

When I was three, there were no computers that would fit in my house
capable of running EQ. What should I hit you with. Are you digestable?

but I assure you both weapons were indigestable. Hence your arguement
is moot, and inedible by extension.

I also find Pizza hut pizza full of grease but technically digestable.
I prefer Domino's.

self-destructive behavior, and physcotic episodes."  Bet you never
look

Ahhh I see your point, Kirby eats and digests everything. Must eat....
everything....like Kirby.....must eat....Spain!
