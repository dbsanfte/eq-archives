Celestial Essence is your sticking point?  I don't know about on your
server, but on Luclin, you can purchase a mage item that can be used with
celestrial solvent (purchased in shadowhaven at the spell component
vendors).

Direct Quote from EQTraders page:"
  1.. If you do not have PoP, and would prefer to spend money instead of
spending time scrounging the below items, you can buy unlimited amounts of
Scent of Marr from 3 different vendors: Lyth Spellstar in East Commons is in
a hut beside the inn closest to the West Commons zoneline, Hanlore Escaval
is in the Herb Jar in South Qeynos, and a clockwork merchant is in Ak'Anon's
Library Mechanamagica (loc 1075, -1040, near Tergon Brenclog). Lyth and
Hanlore are on Qeynos Caster faction (Order of Three), and the clockwork
merchant is on Ak'Anon Caster faction (Eldritch Collective). Faction work,
sneaking or wolf form may be needed in order to shop from them.
  2.. If you do have PoP, then visit Darius Gandril (52, 1530) in Plane of
Knowledge for celestial solvent, and Loran Thu`Leth (-112, 1407) in Plane of
Knowledge for Scent of Marr "
1000pp each?  I find that incredbily hard to belive.

Also, may i suggest acrylia studded armor?  It tends to have some good wis
on it; and if you're looking for ac you're in trouble, Druids are NOT
supposed to be getting hit at your level.

Have you tried soloing?  Kiting is very effective and if you can get C3 you
should be able to just crank those mobs out.  At 46 I was in DL kiting
skeletons, and DSP killing stonegrabbers...solo.

Hope this helps,
Dea
