Buy another PoP CD.

I know that sounds callous, but that really is your only option.  Bottom
line: when you bought the CD, the key you used was irrevocably linked to
your account.  Once you cancelled your account, you made that CD key
worthless.  You have to get a new key, which means buying another PoP CD.
