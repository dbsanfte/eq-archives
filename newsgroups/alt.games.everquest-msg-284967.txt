As I said, I'm no expert, so I looked up the Constitution of the United 
States to find the following.

Section 8 [Scope of *Legislative* power] of Article I states the 
following:

"The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts 
and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and 
general welfare of the United States; but all duties, imposts and excises 
shall be uniform throughout the United States; 
...
To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, 
and with the Indian tribes; "

I don't think that "regulate" means "tax". I believe it refers to 
stipulating appropriate rules under which such commerce may be conducted 
- legislation, as the section heading reads, not taxation. Further, it 
states...

"No tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any state."

It would appear to me that it is the customer's purchase that is taxed, 
not the merchant's sale, and that tax is levied by the state in which the 
customer resides.
