I seem to recall exp in dalnir petering out around 32... I think Splitpaw 
might keep ya occupied longer.  Or... some of the entrance mobs of Lguk 
might be doable, particularly if you're not KoS to live frogs yet.  I 
think I camped the Ancient Croc for a good few levels about 30, the first 
time around.  Are gatorscale legs still uber for a 30 cleric? :)
