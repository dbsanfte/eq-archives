My KEI usually lasts out it's full duration when I get it.  I usually opt
for extended if it's available.  I never send someone a tell asking for it,
I just pop into nexus, wait 30 seconds or so, and then go to whoever is
casting extended if available, regular if not.  Personally, I am with you on
the buff beggars, I get quite a few requests for various buffs, mostly I
just ignore them.  If someone shouts/oocs they are looking for one, and I am
not busy, I will often cast it on them.
