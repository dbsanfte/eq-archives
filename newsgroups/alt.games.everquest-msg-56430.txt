Not really - Erudins still have the highest base, but the High Elves start
off life with more easily accessible spells to buy. (All of the enchant
metal line, with the exception of steel, can be found in Felwithe)

The only real recommendation is to ensure that your enchanter is
agnostic. A religion hamstrings all of the enchanter illusion spells
because the mobs still know what god you worship, no matter what your form
is.
