I was with a group last night and they asked me if I had either of the last
2 items mentioned above.
I had never heard of these but now that I have I would like to be able to
get them for my NEC pet.
Are these only provided by a MAG or can I get a potion or something so I can
get them myself,
or maybe they are just purchase type items, like I said I had never heard of
them till last night.

If they are only MAG supplied items, what is a fair trade for these for my
skellie pet?

Thanks for all the help everyone here has given me over the course of my
adventures......Ben
