I read their policy as "If your account is hacked, it will be banned".
Maybe I missed the part about innocence and guilt, and the part where
the player was banned.

Speaking of assumptions, you apparently are assuming that this is why
Verant has this policy. I think it's far more likely that they wanted
to reduce the amount of time they were spending chasing down cases of
alleged account theft.

Their was a thread here not so long ago wherein it was claimed that
high level players share their passwords with guildmates on a regular
basis.

Can you cite numbers to support this claim of excessive profits?

Neither do I, but I certainly understand it.

If all you need help with is changing your password, then you don't
need any help at all. You can change your password whenever you want,
with no assistance from Verant.
