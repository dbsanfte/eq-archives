NOTE: If your not interested in the Team PvP servers Vallon Zek, and Tallon
Zek then this message wont interest you.

Ive been playing on Vallon Zek long enough now to notice some rather bleak
disparities in the various teams. For those of you not familiar with the
rule set used by the Team PvP servers the various teams are Human (
Froglock, Vha Shir, Human, Barbarisn, and Erudites ), Elf ( High Elves, Wood
Elves, and Half Elves ) , Peck ( Gnomes, Haflings, and Dwarves ), and the
Dark Team ( Iksar, Troll, Ogre, and Dark Elves ).  Looking at the various
teams it is quite clear that the Peck, dark, and Elf teams are missing some
key abilities for higher end raiding and grouping. Dark team is missing the
ability to track, and elves/pecks are missing Shamans slows, with Elf teams
additionally missing the ability to feign pull.  A feign puller is somthing
that can for the most part be worked around. Slows however are a big hit, as
is tracking on the dark team. The lack of these key skills is one reason why
many people chose to cross-team. Cross teaming in my mind circumvents the
whole purpose of Vallon and Tallon Zek. The dis-incentive to be a "Pure"
guild is strong. To alleviate that I would suggest the following changes be
made to the Team PvP servers. I welcome any input that people may have on
these ideas, whether they be from a PvP server or not :)

1) Give Troll, Ogre, and Iksar Shamman the Tracking skill comparable to a
druids.  Give Troll, Ogre,  Iksar, and Dark Elf Shadowknights tracking like
what a bard has.

2) Give Druids the ability to quest for Slow spells that are not quite as
good as Shaman slows, but better than Enchanter Slows.

I think that if those two steps were implemented it would be a BIG incentive
to go back to the way the server was intended, IE Purist guilds, and a LOT
less Cross teaming.

Anyone out there have any input ? Id be glad to hear it ? : )

Oh and yes, I realize that SOE will probably never see this message so its
all just wishfull thinking ;)
