    2000 mana, can be used with Mass Group Buff, takes one spell slot.

> Ancient: Gift of Aegolism gives 1300 hp and 69 AC.

    I know of nobody that has this. Consider it a rumour until someone posts
where it is.

    Marzin's Mark drops as a loot off a very tough Ssra mob - you would be
better off looking at Symbol of Marzin (350 mana, 700 HPs) instead, or
Naltron's Mark (group buff, 446 HPs, 500 mana). Even with Marzin's Mark,
you're looking at 575 mana + 350 mana per person who needs the AC from the
cleric, and 1200 mana from the druid, AND three buff slots, AND you have
stacking conflicts with a cleric's self-only level 58 buff and a mage
self-only mana regen buff. We had to not use Aegolism recently when we tried
the High Priest in Ssra (his AoE overwrites AC buffs, and thus will wipe
Aegolism but not PotG + Marzin), and afterwards my buffs were a mess.

    As a complete aside, this is how my buffs normally look on a raid:

Blessing of Aegolism.
Blessed Armor of the Risen
Koadic's Endless Intellect
Talisman of the Brute
Brell's Mountainous Barrier
Group Resist Magic
Circle of Seasons
Talisman of Epuration
motley other buffs (DMF, Talisman of the Cat, Speed of the Shissar, etc.)

    With those buffs up I sit at 4100 HPs/1050 AC and all resists in the 130
to 190 range. And yes, no matter what mobs we're facing I ask for all three
resist buffs during lulls. You never know what might happen, and it's not
like I'm going to run out of buff space (even assuming a bard epic proc/mind
wrack, two bard songs and space for a heal over time).

    The arrangement we have is "run like hell druids, inc AoE Aegolism!"
Just the same as when the shamans cast AoE Khura's, except we clerics have
too much dignity to scurry and simply click it off and re-cast BAotR. :-)
