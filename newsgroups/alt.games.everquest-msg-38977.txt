Followed the advice, and can now see the armor.  The
real problem was finding the correct file.  Seems I
had 2 eqclient.ini files, one all in lower case, one
all in upper.  I had to use the "find files" feature
on my start bar to learn this.  One of them seems to
dummy file containing the default chat colors.  Anyways,
all better now.
   So, any ideas as if this was just an oddity on
my machine?  Do most people have to take special
steps to see the velious textures, or just me?

Annie <--- just curious about it.
