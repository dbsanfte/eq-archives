I think there may be a correlation between that mentality and the slacker
generation's way of thinking.  Saddly, I'm starting to think Gen X was the

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
