I've seen this also. I used to be on ISDN and I saw it once every few 
weeks. I moved and spent about 6 weeks on 38K and I saw it quite often, 
well every 4 or 5 days. I've got ADSL now and havn't seen it since. Also 
as well has half the models in the zone not having any animation, some 
were the default human model instead of what they should have been.
