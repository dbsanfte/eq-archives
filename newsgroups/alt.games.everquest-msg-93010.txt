  I am playing 3 War right now my best war is a Troll War. with Regen you
can level up faster. VERY up to lvl 17 when sitting you heal faster then
some healers get mana back as you should know from your iksar monk. that
allso has regen.
   lenny can kill yellows (non casters) by himself
                                           Lenny
