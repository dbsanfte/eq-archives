Because it would invariably create situations where one or more
classes were considered 'lame' or unsuitable? The odds of them
balancing it so that every bit of content was equally 'cool' are too
slim to be worth considering. (And, if they DID, you'd have the same
people whining that 'all classes are the same'.) So you end up with a
situation where:

If you play a paladin, you can do everything a berzerker can do AND
you can help your group survive in the Chasm of Pits, which has the
Phattest L00t Evar.

If you play a berzerket, you can only help your group survive in the
Pit of Chasms, which totally suxx0rz.

So which would you play?

(The alternative is to make sure the Pit of Chasms and the Chasm of
Pits give the same or eqaul loot, which goes back to the beginning of
the circle -- if they're both equally good, then, where's the
"variety"?)

I honestly think those whining about class balance are those who want
to be 'the most powerful class' and can't deal with the fact there
isn't one.
