I have, and I stand by that line above: I quote;

You state in black and white, globally, that all parents with genetic
issues are a kind of person who should be shot because they are playing
Russian Roulette - yes the 75% bit says you are talking about serious
issues but its far too throw-away as if that defines genetic issues.

Its way too global, it ignores a lot of issues about genetic conditions
(42 mentioned several of them), it ignores a lot of context of
reproduction and not uncommon events (that is where and why I brought
Down's into it) and because of that I think it is horrendously off the
mark.
