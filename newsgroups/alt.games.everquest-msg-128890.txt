If you don't know the reasons why they are hated (or why they are
stereotyped as greedy and rich), then I suggest you go to your local
library and read up on the history you refer to.

Cite sources or shut up.

That was profound. You come up with that all by yourself?

Look in the mirror and you might see one reason.

To travel so far and still be so ignorant, is truly sad. Maybe your
time would have been better spent actually "learning" history instead
of twisting it.

>Religions don't bother me, Assholes do.

You must be filled with self loathing then.
