    Or that the game's downtime is so tedious that players will do anything
to get around it. What was that figure you gave me for a druid medding back
a full pool, 15 to 20 minutes? Sounds exciting! The one twink I have that's
fallen behind the others in the level race is, not-so-coincidentally, the
one that has no way of getting back mana faster than normal med rate. It's
painful to play her without a big stack of magazines nearby to read.
