Finally have one machine done and connected.  We didn't upgrade yet, just
trying to get on.  Now I know folks will say why not just copy the files
over.  One is installed on C: and the other is D: so I don't want to bring a
file over that has a different location.

For any with the i/o problem. I deleted the zero length file and it fixed
it.  Also, I turned off virus checking and that made a BIG difference. Of
course it's 11 PM here on the East Coast so maybe some folks went to bed.
