	Um, why?

	The natural progression of levels would have gotten people out of FG and
Velk's.  At 61 you should start seeing light blue 'shrooms, which means it's
already time to think about leaving.  Making everything 52 and under green is
way overkill -- for one thing, it means you pretty much have to fight mobs
that summon if you want experience, and that more or less kills most classes
that previously could solo.

	This change will have exactly the opposite effect of what you want.  My
split will not move from 100% AA until I have every damned sub-Planar AA point
I want.  I suspect that will be true for a lot of people, meaning the hunting
grounds you want cleared are going to be even more packed than ever, as people
huddle into them trying to earn the experience they want before their ability
to earn experience at all is essentially stripped.
