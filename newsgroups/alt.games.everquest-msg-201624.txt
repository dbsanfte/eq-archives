(Yes, I know Malo and Malosini don't stack.  :)  I was being dramatic.  But
we often Malo before we Malosini, since Malo is far harder to resist.)

Hm...  It's something I'd noticed, time and again.  Rather than cork off my
mouth and embarass myself (something I'm damned good at doing), I'm going to
run some experiments and gather some serious data.    Anyone care to join
me?

I'm going to track my resists by 20 pct of mob health - see how often I get
resisted at full, 80, 60, 40, 20 and just that last little smidgen left.  In
my experience - with no numbers to back it up - it seems to me that I will
often get resisted when the mob is full health, very few resists from 80 to
20, but resists ramp back up at the end.  I remember having a paladin tell
me that mobs that don't run (either through disinclination or root) hit
harder at the end - sort of a last-gasp frenzy sort of thing, at the same
point that a mob would run, Gate, or whatever.  I assumed that the resist
boost was related.

It'll be good to get some hard data to confirm or deny this impression.
I'll have to work at it; I automatically stop nuking at the end there out of
long habit.
