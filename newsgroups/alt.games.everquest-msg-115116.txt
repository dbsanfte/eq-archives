Sounds like you have a problem with your guild.  We are not a raiding guild,
we are a guild filled with a bunch of people who like to get together and
have fun playing.  We have never had to cancel a Reaver raid due to the
rogue not showing up.  We have had to cancel them due to no rogue signing up
however.
