From the shadows, the mysterious "sanjian"
<haibane_please_dont_spam_me_reki@yahoo.com> (if that IS his real
name) conspiratorially whispered:

>What I'm curious about is how things have changed from the very beginning.

Here's one no one else has mentioned that I saw: there was no weather
for the first week or so in release. I was happily killing skeletons
in butcherblock one night when suddenly this extremely loud blast
comes out the computer speakers; I nearly soiled myself. Then it
started raining.

Then it never stopped raining! They didn't have the percentages set
very well at first. :-p
