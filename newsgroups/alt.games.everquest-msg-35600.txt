Following up on your post Ryouseika because my pitiful excuse for a
newsserver is dropping posts like mad.  From my personal experience, having
several gay friends, none of them feel the need to get up and yell to the
world that they are gay, and the world had better like it.  As a matter of
fact, they, gasp, appear to be perfectly normal people, whom you would never
know are gay, unless they told you.  It's not a matter of being in the
closet, just that they don't feel the need to proclaim their sexual
orientation to the world, much as I don't.
