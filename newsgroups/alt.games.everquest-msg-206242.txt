East Karana will take you to 25 pretty smoothly.  You can also stop off in
South Karana and kill blue-con centaurs (probably mostly Archers at your
level.  Take note - all centaurs shoot arrows and run fast).  At 26,
experience slowed down so I went to Luclin.  I don't know where you would go
Old World after that - High Hold Keep or StoneBrunt Mountains perhaps.  When
you get Luclin, you'll have more options available.

Do a search on Shaman's Crucible - they'll have hunting guides.
