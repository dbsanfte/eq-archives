Hehe....seb not so bad ;p Nothing hits too hard so if things go pear shaped
can usually make it to exit (2 exits in seb, one near entrance, one near
shrooms).  Just dont let em run :D

Ilis summon, so do Reets, most named do.  You will also get dispelled loads,
so not really worth taking outside buffs imo.  Can make nice plat just
trawling the areas near the front.

Was tough as a ranger at 60, with medicore gear, was fairly easy as long as
not too many adds at 65 with headshot.  70 + new gear + clicky root makes
most of it trivial.

Acrylia Caverns is another nice dungeon imo :) Good plat and a fair few
named here (as well as acrylia).
