Actually no I played this character from level one. Halfling rogues
level surprisingly fast. 

As for Tier 3, I am flagged for Tactics (hunted Diaku in storms for
days to get the parts) and of course since I am over 62 have access to
BoT and HoH. I don't know if you are familiar with the drops in PoP
zones but there is basically no money to be had *with the occasional
named dropping a few plat and an items, any gems that drop generally
go to the cleric to replace Dots used for the hunt.  The parchs that
drop I generally don't roll on as I am not a spell using class. I have
also hunted the worm parts in PoD for the CoD key  <this was before
they opened those zones up> and I have the Mark of execution from the
trials in PoJ. I do not consider myself uber and I have worked very
hard for what I have. I am looking to raise the cash for ornate now
and since the chaepest chain patterns go for 20k I need a good
continuous source of income. This is the reason why I asked. Not to be
accused of being an Ebayer. 

I am aware of the HG camps and the cyclops in OOT. I am just looking
for toher sources of income in the game. I was not aware that the
guards in HHK drop good cash I would be willing to take the faction
hit to get some good cash. Thank you for the ideas as well as the
accusations that I am an ebayer. Oh, and by the way in case you wanted
to put me in the "all level 65 people are rich" category as well...Im
not.
