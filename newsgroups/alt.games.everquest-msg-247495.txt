I don't know, Biz.  They see it working already.

They see IGE turning a profit (I realize that IGE does more than just EQ,
but I think it's fair to say that the majority of their business is EQ
related) buy doing it the old fashioned way .. buying plat and items from
players and selling it at a higher price to other players.  SOE has the
advantage of being able to do it with out the middleman ... they just up the
counters and create the plat.  They control the flow of plat, they control
the prices of plat.

Kinda like OPEC, to a certain degree.
