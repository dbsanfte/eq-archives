This is a great combo- a battery (a few plat) combined with the item 
refills it with 20 charges. The press weighs 5 stone, and a charge is a 
right click to summon a full stack of bandages. In other words, for 5 stone 
and two slots (one for the press one for the bandages) you can effectively 
have 400 bandages on you. If you are willing to take up a bag slot for the 
toolkit and a slot for a stack of batteries, you could have 8000 bandages.

This is much better (IMO, and a moot point for me being restricted to 
blunts) than reducing your DPS just to get some bandages.
