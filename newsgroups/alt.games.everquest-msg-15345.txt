Mind you, I couldn't prove it, but I have to say that you're observing
something that's a complete illusion or coincidence. I believe that it's
been almost universally stated that, with the exception of the warrens,
loot is determined at spawn time. And unless some 50th level is
wandering around the island afterwards handing out eyes to the gargs, it
doesn't change.
