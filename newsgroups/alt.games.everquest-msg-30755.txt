when I needed to make some relatively quick cash, I went to the bandit camp
in West Karana (the one nearest the wizard spires, of course)

the bandits drop bronze weapons. they also drop bandit sashes. Depending on
your faction, you can turn the bandit sashes in and get random weapons. sell
the weapons from the quest and the ones that drop, and it's pretty decent
cash for very little effort.

(bind yourself in Qeynos to easily gate back for selling, then teleport to
the west karana portal...)
