undead mobs have different rules for aggro -- usually proximity is the
greatest factor (akin to rooted mobs)

apparantly some skellys in kurns are subject to this, but it isn't true for
all undead

stand farther away than the tank ....in fact, it's generally good practice
to stand as far away as possible while keeping in melee range

the other thing is that you have to make sure the tank is standing right up
against the mob, close as possible
