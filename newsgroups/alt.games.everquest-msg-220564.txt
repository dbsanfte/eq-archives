I'm sure you can come up with a better example than that.

If I was able to do it with a Paladin and a Shaman knowing nothing more
than what zone the mobs' were in it can't be too hard.  I was shocked

very easy quest at that level of the game trivial, why not just have an
NPC at each TT zoneline handing out the keys?
