Didn't really keep track. Didn't care. As long as my exp is going
to the positive I wasn't worried about it.

In general after fighting some specific mobs for a while I would
try and figure about how many hit point they had and I would then
try and Nuke for about 40% of those hit points. Figuring that
the damage shield was doing about 20%, and me and the pet
doing 40% each. Some mobs probably did not get enough damage from
me due to fizzles and resists. However, I was flying up in levels so fast
I had to stop several times to practice skills. So the loss of exp
to the pet was minimal. Many times I had the pet tank alone for
a while if I was low on mana from AEing the adds, fizzles and
resists.

The whole key is to balance pet health, your health and
your mana.  After a couple fights I would be at 50% on all 3
so all 3 would be regening at the same time. Yes you MUST tank
when you are at low levels. Gets your defense up and saves the pet.

Always keep the phantom armor on for the regen. That is a HUGE
advantage of the class. No other class I know of gets a regen spell
that early. The summoned bandages and bind wound skill are useful
as well.

Also when you are tanking turn the mob so that your pet is beating
on its back. Things are easier to hit from behind, also the mob
can not dodge, parry or riposte a rear attack. I can't tell you how many
times I see a mage and their pet both on the front of the mob. */boggle*
