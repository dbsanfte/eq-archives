I've had occasion to think about doing that, too, but like you and Lance, I
would never do it because it's just a shitty thing to do to others. On the
other hand, I've sometimes managed to convince a few others that the
adventure should be abandoned and this seems to work out ok, even if there's
one person who would prefer to continue (especially if that one person is
the one causing the trouble).

Oh man, this is where I would blow a gasket. What the hell is someone doing
*starting* an LDoN adventure if they're not sure they have "permission" to
play, and may have to bow out in 10 minutes? This is an EverQuest capital
crime and anyone irresponsible enough to do this goes on my list.

Unfortunately, I've seen this movie before and it never gets any better.
LDoN exposes us to more of these because of the wider availability of pickup
groups, so expect a sequel coming to your theater soon! ;-)

BTW, what server do you play on?

Winterfury Thunderwolf
