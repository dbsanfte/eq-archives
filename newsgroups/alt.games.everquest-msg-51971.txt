You should ahve memmed your flux spells for Ae stun, enthrall and tash line.
rest is then tailored to situation. one buff slot should be kept for
swapping in and out clarity, haste etc. Tepid Deeds if you dont have a
shaman and cast it if fights are longish, if they die within 20 secs you
dont need to slow same goes with the listless power line

Keep AE mez memmed if you gettign a lot of overpulls

Curse of simple mind is of no use, really a PvP spell

You'll get fast exp grouping in Overthere or FM, or move to velious and
group killing snow cougars or try for crystal caverns
