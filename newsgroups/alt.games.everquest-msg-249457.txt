I think thats probably why it's not doing so well.  Well, it might be doing
ok for a monthly subscription FPS, I dont' really know.. but not EQ type
400k users "doing well".

I played it for about three months after release, and for another 2 month
stretch a bit later.  (And somewhat considering restarting for one more
month to kill my free time.)  IMO the real advanatage over the other FPS'es
is the number of people it allows.   There can be at least a few hundred
people on any one continent, and thousands in the world.   Biggest halflife
server I saw (the only other FPS I really played multiplayer) was 25 or 50.

Whether thats enough to offer to base a montly subscritpion game on, I don't
know.  *shrug*
