Nope.  My wizard wears a pair of GEBS and keeps his tboots in an open
inventory slot, and activates them from there.

>b) have a casting time.

True, but only something along the lines of three seconds or so.  Not
sure exactly how it calculates channeling ability with these things,
but I've been able to channel through the casting time before.  Unless
you do a lot of pulling or tanking of debuffing mobs, these are every
bit as good as Jboots.  And if you're of a level to camp Jboots, you
can easily make up twice that much cash in the time it would take you
to find the AC.
