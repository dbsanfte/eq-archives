How about opening a container of the kind of food that is being stolen,
remove the food, and put in the following note, and reseal the container and
leave it in the fridge:

    Dear Food Thief;

    As you can see, I know how to open and reseal these containers.
    This isn't the first container I've opened and resealed.

    I bet you'll soon wish you knew what I put in the last thing you
    stole from me, so you'll know what to tell your doctor when you
    are begging for him to help you.

    Don't worry...it won't be fatal, just very painful for a while
    if you don't take preventative measures *soon*.

    Enjoy.
