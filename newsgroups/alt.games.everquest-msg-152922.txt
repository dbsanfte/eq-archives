Actually, I'm sorta looking forward to it.  EQ has quite a few "issues" that
need to be resolved, and I doubt Verant will do so with the orignal EQ.  Way
I figure, I'll give it a try just like I did DAoC, but I'm not going to
cancel my EQ account either (I played both games for a while, until it was
evident that DAoC just wasn't going to do it for me.)

OTOH, we've seen all the games that were supposed to pwn3z EQ.  Those that
actually made it to production have failed to even scratch EQ.  Maybe we're
all skeptics, but we know a pattern when we see one.
