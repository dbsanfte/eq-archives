I live in Adelaide, and my char is on E'ci. Llia is a level 7 Wood Elf Ranger
currently based in GFay.

Currently, I'm on holidays. I go back to work on the 20th... *sigh* So the times
I'm on vary as to what I'm doing during the day and evening. When I do go back
to work, I'll probably be on from 7ish in the evening. There also seems to be a
reasonable number of people on in the afternoon/evening.

Cheers
