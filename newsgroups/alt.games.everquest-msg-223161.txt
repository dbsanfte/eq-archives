As Graeme said, probably he just cast a few quick stuns, then taunted.

You mean spellcasting.  Taunting does not help you hold aggro at all, only
to get aggro.

Careful spellcasting will probably do more to help your aggro than switching
weapons even.    I used to have a guild ranger who had aggro problems.  His
aggro problems were that he liked to snare on incoming, then DoT (swarm),
then DoT/Debuff (immolate), then start meleeing.  He couldn't understand why
he was completely unable to jolt aggro onto me after all that...

As long as you're not going completely over the top, as in the above
example, a paladin should have no trouble holding aggro off of you with the
occasional low level stun.  With a warrior, it's more up to you to be
careful, since he doesn't have those options.
