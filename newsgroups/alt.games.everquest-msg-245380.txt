Just wondering since I do alot of faction work which is better to be ally to
the Coldain or the Kroms?


( Yes, I am well aware of the shawl and ring quests so that is a separate
subject please. )

Are most dragons in a faction family? If so what is that? not that I want to
be able to walk up and pet one but I am curious.

Thank you in advance
