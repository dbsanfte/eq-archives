Shaman get SoW at level 9, plus, no CR and no xp loss for dying, so no 
counterincentive to doing it at that level.  On all the blue servers, it is 
forbidden to purposely train someone, RP or not.  If you get petitioned for 
doing it, and are observed doing it, or reported admitting to it, you will 
likely get a mark on your account.
