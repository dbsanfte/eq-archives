it procs for me 3-5 times during battle which is a hands free lifedraw that
may last through 3-4 battles (single pulls)

well worth the mana cost, imho

cast prior to pull, no need to trgt self, and let it do the work......... of
course its the first spell I swap out in case I need something else like
Gather Shadows (which you're gonna love ;)

my lineup is:
Lifedraw
Engulfing D
Vampiric Embrace
Grim Aura
Heat Blood
FD
Pet/Str Death swap
Fear
