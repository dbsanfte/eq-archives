    But hopefully that's what it means.

    I'd guess the Eye was being used for more of the same sort of
shenanigans as in Kedge - summon it close to a locked door, get things on
other side of locked door to come to you. Eye pulling in ToV is useful, but
except perhaps for the Vyemm pull life will still go on without it. (And
using Eyes to put flurry drakes in the rotunda was just wrong.)

    They mean "entertaining for our staff", I imagine. :-/

    Nice story on one of the message boards: druid petitioned that he was
having troubles with Wolf Form not showing. GM told him to /bug it. He
replied to the GM something like "That's ok, I'll wait for someone to find
an exploit with it and then you'll fix it." BANG - GM right beside him
asking him "What seems to be the problem, sir?"

    You sound sorta bitter in this post, Dream King. Usually you're perkier
than the rest of us. Cheer up - there's a ton of goodness in this patch, and
hopefully there'll be more to come. And if you had them - my condolences on
the Holgresh Beads.
