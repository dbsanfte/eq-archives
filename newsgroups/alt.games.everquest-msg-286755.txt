They tell me to roll, I roll.  But on more than one occaision, upon 
winning something that I thought shouldn't go to me, I've turned an item 
down that I've won.  Would I have done the same here?  I think so, but 
since I didn't win, its hard to say for sure.

Another SK who wasn't there also rolled.  Had he been second highest 
roller and I had won, I'd probably have taken the egg.  Had one of the 
SK who'd actually camped the thing come in second, I'd probably have 
passed to him.

None of that went thru my mind at the instant I rolled though.
