Again you just resort to insults rather than suggesting I am wrong and then
telling me why, I just am because my approach or opinion is not shared by
you.

You get the last say in this because I really have no need to argue with
someone who gives no reason for his arguements. You are just right and we
all need to learn that, is that how it is?

I will ask, since my head must have been up my arse at the time, for a list
of all the people who have shown displeasure in my posts.
