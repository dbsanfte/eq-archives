Hmmm I see much the same thing in EQ. Goal for game is to become 65 with 
tons of AA and uber gear, then what just keep fighting for more AA and 
scrounge up some more gear.

I miss something unique in the game, like a NPC that needs rescue and when 
he is rescued, he is really rescued and does not respawn for the next 
character to rerescue him, or killing vendors will make 'em disappear for a 
longer time than a couple of mins, then one could really make a mark in the 
game.
