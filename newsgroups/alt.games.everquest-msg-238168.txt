I am not being insulting whatsoever. But you're posting these
revelations like they are special or unusual. This is completely
normal behavior for someone trying to troll. The *only* thing of any
note to this sock is the gigantic size of the original post. The
problem in the last one of yours was this:

No, Foxeye, it's not. It's someone who has rudimentary knowledge of
how to rile people up in a newsgroup. It's basic. A million other
trolls have done exactly the same thing, *I* have done the same thing,
not on usenet but other places, for humor's sake.

You're doing two bad things:

1. You're coming off as a newbie. You've been around a reasonable
amount of time, you should know better. We've had trolls here before,
after all. Not often sockpuppets, maybe.

2. You're giving props to the troll he does not deserve even if you
don't realize it. This is not very special behavior.
