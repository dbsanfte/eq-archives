/chuckle, I got "its your video and sound card".

Right, I've played for 30 days+ and done many zonings with no problems,
but OoT to East Freeport is almost a guaranteed crash. And I had sound
off for most of the game.

My bet is that it is all caused by the program deciding to change ports
and not handling the changeover properly. Whenever I've had problems
(server connects, zoning crash,etc) I can see port changes on the
tcpdump output.
