I've a lot of work to do before this even becomes a choice, but I"m just
curious...does anyone here have any personal experiences with the "Double
Riposte" line of AAs?  Celt on the Glade just says "this sorta sucks with
DW, but I bet it's cool with a high damage weapon!", so I'm mostly
interested in those who use two handers, since obviously the ripostes with
one handed weapons will be fairly weak.

P.S. For those of you who remember my earlier questiosn about "buying
looting rights" and "agh, where do I find a good staff?"....I finally got
my Greatstaff of the Four Winds (aka Sally) two days ago. :)  My
obssession sparked what I"m calling Xev's new Open Server Raids.  Two
groups of randoms led by one tenacious ranger (not me, mind you...he's an
old friend with magician bots who was looking for something more fun to do
than duoing named mobs :P) have been making the raiding guilds sorta
grouchy lately, but with mobs that spawn every 8 hours, I don't feel too
guilty.  Heck, these two groups even took down the toughest tower
boss...tho it took us a while to coordinate on the kygges, or whatever
those aoe'ing giants are called.  My new stick sho is purty.  And it's so
touching how many people I don't know have heard my story and are
congratulating me on my success.  

<----- thinks the world is a pretty nice place right now
