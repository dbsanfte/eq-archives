Think that guy was nerfed anyway, not sure when katta banker goes green, may
be worth looking at.

Freshly dinged 46, you are just asking for trouble :P

Hehe, seems about par for the course in PoJ on getting groups, I guess some
just dont see the ooc or something (this is usually peoples first plane).

You should be able to put ok dps on anything but that monk guy, think the
others are DB (has been a while though).

Hmm 7 mobs from exit camp? He must of really tried to get those adds, or
been in wolf form.

Told you you was asking for trouble :), of course if you was well into 46,
the adds would never of come, and you wouldnt of died :P

I believe it will, hmm, maybe possible to get a level 10 into poj if they
eat enough 0% rez deaths? Would be funny I guess /ooc 10 berserker lfg!

You would generally only get aggro if you stood at the 'mob' end of the
corridor at exit camp, rather than the exit end.

See other post :)

Bah..slacker ranger :P

Not sure there is much difference, would guess PoJ is better, PoI will be
nicer still (no exp bonus for close mobs until 55 ? I believe).

Maybe case for erm, endless axe aa? :P

Suggest not running out :D Keeping yourself topped up between fights seems a
better method, if you remember and are not the puller.

Yep, obviously a higher level will be more powerful, but you can still pull
enough weight to make  a meaningful difference.

Is what makes the game fun imo :)
