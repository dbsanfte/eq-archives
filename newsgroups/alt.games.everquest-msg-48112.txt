I'm going to start a new character on FV tonight and was wondering what
those who are already playing on it think. I realize the low-level
competition is tight, but besides that, does it seem worthwhile so far?

What are the least occupied/most rewarding zones?'
What are the most over-populated races/classes?
Do the new restrictions really make it THAT much more difficult?

I am thinking of a High-Elf either Enchanter or Cleric. Any opinions?

Thanks,

Phinehas - 13 Halfling Rogue <Heroes of Destined Heights>
Dolff - 6 Barbarian Shaman
