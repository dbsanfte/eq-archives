Oh yeah. Happened to me a lot. And, BTW, this is why they don't/can't
"tell you what's wrong" during the restore process. A lot of time,
they don't know/aren't sure. I have a bad habit of reporting on errors
before I've completely verified the issues, i.e:

"OK, found the bug, it's 'A'"
"Erm..it may not be 'A'. Looking at 'B'"
"Definitely 'B', with a bit of 'C'...'A' IS there, after all, but it's
not causing THIS bug."
Etc, etc, etc.

The latest post says they had to fly out hardware engineers from their
server provider, so it sounds like something more than "Just reload
the backup tapes".

The team was there for, it is claimed, 40 hours straight. I honestly
don't see how anyone can whine they were not doing all that they
could. As for "This should never have happened in the first place!",
well, a LOT of things -- many far more important than losing a day of
gametime -- should not have happened if everyone was 100% on the ball.
Welcome to the real world.
