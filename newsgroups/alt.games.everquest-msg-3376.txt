Well, if you could only get level 10 after a month or two...  Was this
among different characters?

Some of the stuff in the expansions is nothing short of spectacular...
although, since the basic requirements for the game itself havn't
changed much in the past two years, they've been kinda limited as to
how far they can push the graphics.  That being said, some of the
sights in Velious can make you wonder if you're playing the same game
as a year ago.

>Local servers yet ?

Nope.  Everything still in San Diego.  Playing here in North Carolina,
lag isn't much of an issue at all, really, at least not on thier end.
But, yeah, patches and stuch are still firmly on a Left Coast, USA
schedule.

>Does it work ok in Direct 3D or is glide still the way to go ?

*shrugs*  Don't see how Glide is "the way to go", as it works
perfectly fine on most all non-voodoo 3d cards out there.  

>Are there any other games like it which are better ?

Well, that's subjective.  Asheron's Call might be "better", if you
happen to prefer a non-class based system and a larger (albiet more
drab) world.  Ultima Online might be "better" if you prefer PVP,
tradeskills, and property ownership.

If, however, you like pure hack n' slash, with a bit of tradeskill
depth (at least, they're getting better wit this), and a fairly large
world, EQ is probably your best bet.

>Is Everquest 2 just about to be released or something ?

Probably not for a year or two yet.  Not even any grumblings from it's
development stages.

However, Fallen Age and Dark Age of Camelot are both in beta, and will
most likely be released before the  year is out.  They both look
promising, albiet for different reasons.
