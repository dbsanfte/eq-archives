Hello! I've been having trouble with my computer going LD a few times every
hour, for the past few weeks. Usually I'd just curse the internet gods, or
whine about my cable connection going flakey, but this seems different.
First, I have 2 accounts. If I go online with both, only the one computer
goes LD. Strange. I havent done too much to my computer, beyond fooling with
some stuff last weekend. But I was having problems before that.

So, anyone know why this might be happening? Its hard to diagnose while I'm
in EQ, but it seems like I'm not going LD at all. As soon as I get the "You
have been disconnected" message, I go straight to the server window, and can
connect right away no problem (except for char re-sync). Resident programs
havent changed in the past few weeks, beyond what I played with last
weekend. Any ideas how I can further diagnose this? Maybe the Bazaar just
hates me, thats the only zone I've been in for weeks. I go LD too often, and
dont have enough time to play to actually move somewhere... :)

Thanks,
Joe
