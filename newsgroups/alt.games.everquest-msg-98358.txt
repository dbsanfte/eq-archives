Ok, I count 13 hrs now I been tryin' to get on. I got on twice now, killed 4
giants total. killed 2, then servers went down again, came up maybe 20
minutes ago. Now down again, I just hope they figure out what they are
doing. I can't see payin' premium prices, only to be down more then up..
Maybe with this next fix they will stay up a few hours... I just had to
sound off.. :(   I am starting to lose my sence of hummor..
