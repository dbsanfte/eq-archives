   I agree that it was a very good parody, but I'm not wild about using
"Fansy" and "Hero" in the same sentence.  Fansy certainly has style, but
what he is, when you get down to it, is a griefer.  It may or may not be
true that he's giving grief to other griefers.  Whichever.  While I
enjoyed reading his exploits, I sure as hell wouldn't want him on my
server.

Annie <--- Not a big fan of any griefer.
