I am a wiz who is coming closer to level 20.
I just hit level 16 and cant find all of my spells. Where can i find them? I
have been from Qeynos to Ak anon!
Also it seems that a few spells need ingredients. Will these ingredients be
harder to find and more expensive? Will I need ingredients for all my spells
at higher levels?
What are the 3 reasearch slots in my skills table for? What is research? How
do I do it?

Info or links to info greatly appreciated!
