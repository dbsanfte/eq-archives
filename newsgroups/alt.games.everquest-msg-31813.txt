I had someone(Blackmann) who I told I was petitioning before I sent the
petition(just to see if they had a good excuse for the name) that he was
named after steve blackman the wrestler and that made it OK.  yes, he

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
