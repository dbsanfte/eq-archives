Not sure where you'd move fast and camp to loose agro in SG. You'll
loose agro on the seahorses anyway if you jump out of the water. So,
either succor across SG, or swim. If you have people that don't know
the way, might be better to kill the 3 seahorses first if you decide
to swim across. Once we're at the well, invis and swim down then wait
at the 4 way for the roaming seahorse and then start pullng in the
south tunnel and moving that way. Even if you don't try to split the
pulls, you should never get more than 3 at a time. 

Not sure how familiar you are with SG but you'll run across all the
standard mobs from the zone. Should be pretty cool camp for a group of
mid to high 50s. 

Rgds, Frank
