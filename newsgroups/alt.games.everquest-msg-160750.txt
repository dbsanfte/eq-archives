Its hardly a long swim from the TS port in, and wizards can do the same thing.
But thats not a PoP feature, which is what the OP was asking about.

Katta is one of several cities left out in the cold by this "connection to all

Also out, Seru, Kael, Skyshrine... and probably quite a few others that I don't
think of as cities since I haven't had a character with the faction to bank and
vendor in them.
