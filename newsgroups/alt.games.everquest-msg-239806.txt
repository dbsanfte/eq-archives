This did work, thanks.  Though it told me that my original email
that I used was, well, in use.  But I think I might know why.  When I
go to any of my yahoo emails, I automatically dump everything out of my
bulk mail folder.  I was a bit more careful with the second one, and
indeed, found the comfirmation email there.   So, I guess the real
question is... Do you know that the Yahoo bot considers you to be a
spammer?

I have to admit, I was bit startled to see the statement that most
usenet users have a dim view of web forum and of bridges.  Reall, I had
no idea, and I've been a long time user of both.  Oh, wait.  I forgot,
42 doesn't really speak for all of us.

Yes, that probably would be a good idea.  But you know, some will
just click through the explaination to get to the meat.  There's not
much that can be done about that, I'm afraid.  Heck, I have to admit
that I didn't really read the ToS to join this forum (I hope it just
boiled down to some varient of "Be civil and don't leave your IQ at the
door).  And 42 is sorta right in one regard, IMHO; usenet does tend to
have a different feel to it than web forums.  A.G.E.
(alt.games.everquest) in particular has a pretty vocal group of
regulars who will gladly jump on forum posters with both feet for
making what might seem to be trivial error.  As you might have noticed.
(And will continue to.  Word of advice, ask your people to not
top-post.  Trust me on this).

Anyways, I for one welcome the new posters, even if it turns out that I
am in the vast majority.  Maybe I'll start a baby alt on EM so I have a
legitimate reason to stomp over your forums.
