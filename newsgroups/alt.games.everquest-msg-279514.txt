I have decided it's time we beat the dickheads advertising their dumbass 
guides by competing with our own, free guide of factual information that 
is up to date and doesn't involve cheating.

I would like all you other old farts to scream at me for the bits I get 
wrong. It would probably help the guide somewhat if others add to the 
three I can think of!

I am volunteering to maintain this guide for A.G.E.


The Guide (1st draft)
---------

The methods below recommend this step: Obtain level 70. This is not 
required for many of the methods, but invariably level 70 will enable 
you to farm the plat you want faster than anything else on this guide. 
Do not bother farming plat unless your lack of it is preventing you from 
leveling. The guide itself will assume you are level 70 for all methods.

This guide will not go into detail on how to level to 70 the fastest. 
That may be the subject of a future guide.

Dragons of Norrath: 'creator' missions. This is currently the easiest 
and most reliable way to average around 10k plat an hour.

1. Go LFG. You may want to add a comment "want DoN creators only".
2. After about three minutes you will probably find yourself in a DoN 
creator group. Announce politely that it's your first time and listen to 
everyone's instructions.
3. Complete the creator mission. I have yet to run into a pickup group 
that couldn't pull this off, except for two groups who gave up.
4. Sell all 40 of your crystals in the bazaar. On my server they're 
going for 200pp each, which means 8k per Creator mission you do. 
Creators average less than an hour to complete.

This method will of course be more efficient if you spend all day 
farming the crystals and sell them in the bazaar when you're offline.

Rathe Mountains. Go to Rathe Mountains and kill Hill Giants. This is 
probably the *Easiest* way to make roughly 10k an hour, and also the 
most likely to fall short of that mark on an hour-by-hour basis, 
depending on you, the other people in RM, and the spawns.

If you also destroy every other mob in the area where you notice hill 
giants spawning, you will have them spawning at a -massive- rate. This 
is because hill giants are a random spawn. Each wandering mob you see is 
either a hill giant or a placeholder. Hill Giants still average 15-20pp 
worth of loot every kill, have approximately 2600HP and are level 35-37. 
Any level 70 can solo these guys at a massive rate.

Myconid spore king (old sebilis).

This camp is soloable by any level 70 character of a soloer class. 
Soloability with classes that have debateable soloability, is debateable.

The important drops from this guy are:
1. Fungi Covered Great Staff
2. Fungus Covered Scale Tunic

The tunic still goes for 100k. He is a 30minute respawn which is usually 
a placeholder, with two bodyguards. This camp will average above 10k 
plat if you kill him or his placeholder every 30 minutes.
