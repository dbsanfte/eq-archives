I did a test myself mid 20s IIRC.

I was levelling on Treants in SKa, dinged, and noticed a large HPs gain
on that level even without a sham for +STA buffs at the time. A little
later I died losing my level. I got an aviac charm while levelling back,
and just before I dinged I went and got high level +STA buffs. I went to
the centaurs while the buffs were still up, and turned in the charm +
gem for crafted. The exp dinged me, and I got exactly the same HP gain.

Proof that stam buffs do not effect ding hp gains. It's only a small,
logical, jump to further assume no stats effect permanent gains you get
when you ding (like hp, mana etc)
