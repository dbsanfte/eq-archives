I ordered, cancelled, then gave in and re-ordered LoY, but so far I have
not seen any new customers attracted by LoY. I went to Tunare server and
created some Froglok alts to get a fresh start on a new server. I had a
riot for several days with a non-twinked alt, but in truth, I was
surrounded by uber twinked alts, very few if any new people. I saw a few
"disguised" newbs, but in any prolonged chat, it was funny to watch them
"slip" in some EQ slang here and there. My Wiz is level 9 only, has all
his new armor and has even made enough to upgrade some items via the
bazaar. I must comment here, that prices on Tunare strike me as somewhat
higher than the other servers I normally play on, though that could very
well be an aberration given my limited playing time.

Oh well, off to play my Froggy Warrior, 3 and climbing...... and very
"nekked"!!
