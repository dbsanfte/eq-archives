}Hmm.  I thought that discussion I had with a friend about developing 
}*those* skill was all in jest.  Great, now I've got one *more* thing to 
}deal with along with tradeskills and faction work and upping my 
}neglected melee skills.  I need a volunteer, though, Martin's obviously 
}too busy to deal with just another DE girl.

Ooh, ooh, me, me!  My bazaar mule needs purty people to hang around and 
tempt people to come browse my wares.  I better warn you though, I may not 
be entirely to your delicate DE taste. :)
