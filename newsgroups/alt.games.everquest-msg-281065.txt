  Bought the DoDh CD Tuesday while waiting for patch. WoW was also
patching, so no playing in cyberspace that day.

  Patched both Tuesday night. Noticed no difference in WoW.

  Wednesday, I was on just long enough to get Cadwen halfway through 44,
then check out Adas. She had 18 AA's saved up, and abouth 200 AA's worth
of things to buy.

  Naturally, I chose stonger crits. I bought level 2, worth 141% of a normal 
hit.
Previously, I had been at 115%.
  Test attempt adding out-of-group DPS in WoS didn't go so well; too many 
resists,
full and partial. So I took potshots at greenies in OT.
  Do not like what I see so far. It seems crits are broken: they hardly ever 
happen,
and I'm not getting as big a boost as I calculated I should.
  Obviously, there are numerous questions to address: Is this happening to 
everyone?
Is something not stacking? Are the Spellcasting Fury Mastery and Fury of 
Magic Mastery
AA's really broken?
  It could take weeks to prove anythign to SOE's satisfaction. Weeks more to 
fix things.
Aaaagghhh.
