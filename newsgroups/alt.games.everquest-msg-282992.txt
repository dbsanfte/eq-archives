Due to the way file caching works, there's a very good argument for 
running all instances from the same directory.  Even identical files 
with the same filename, but from different locations on disk, will be 
cached independently, but if you the files are truly from the same 
location, then the same cached image will be used by the system file 
cache, which reduces memory footprint and load times.

Lots of people report just being able to run the game from the same 
directory without changing anything, it just means you need to accept 
all the same settings for the different instances.  If you use a 3rd 
party app, you can run from the same directory but have different 
settings, allowing for example, the second instance to run without 
luclin graphics.
