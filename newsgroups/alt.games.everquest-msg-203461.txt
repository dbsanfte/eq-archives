So hit the R and Y on the keyboard?  Is this while the ZA window isn't
visible?  Haven't had much luck with the other solutions other than
putting program control at "low", which I'd rather not do.

Anyone else getting bumped to desktop if they alt-enter into windowed
mode before you enter the password?  That's a new one for me after the
latest patch.
