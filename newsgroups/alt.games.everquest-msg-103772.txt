Well, you've all certainly sold me. I'm off this weekend to try to
gather up all the stuff. Particularly since the Lambent Stones are not
no-drop items, I think I can pretty much solo this quest with my
warrior, then just get some help transferring the lambent stone to my
wizzie and having a friend do the rest of the turn-in.

Hate to leave my current camp, though. Thank the gods for Gate. ;-)  I
found that the entry area of Mistmoore is VERY challenging at 24, but
once I got the first couple spawns broken, I just about finished all of
level 24 in two hours last night before I had to log.
