Seems like every trainer and warrior quest NPC in Cabilis includes some
pitch, order, threat, etc. that all of the young hatchling warriors have
to "go get started practicing your smithing skills."

Is there something specific to Iksar warriors that's going to make it a
requirement for me to go undertake this expensive tradeskill to get some
cool item, quest, etc.? Or is this just part fo the backstory for
Cabilis in terms of arming up the troops?
