bah    facton smacktion.  Unless you got a PoG Tunare style quest in your 
future, it really does not effect your game play.   err this is a game & 
who the hell care's of you cant go in certain areas in Felwithe?   I am a 
tunare mage, I did the one quest for Cord of Vines, & then why not clear 
PoG & take shots at Tunare?    heh   Next time she dies. 

As long as Verant in thier infinite wisdom does not add content the 
requires Tunare faction, I am fine & if they do...  they had better add 
content to fix that faction as well.
