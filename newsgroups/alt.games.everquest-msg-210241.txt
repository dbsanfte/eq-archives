Your role is to bleed. Rivers of blood shall run down your armor staining it
crimson, for you are a warrior, and that is your due!

You have a better combination of hp/ac than any other class.

SK's and Pally's can actually hold agro better usually, because of all the
spells, but you will find you are a better damage sink than they are.

For an exp group, I would often prefer a SK or Pally for main tank, but for
raids, warriors are king.


To accomplish the goal of keeping the mobs attention, you will find it's
often best to have weapons that proc spells that cause large agro, more than
anything else. One of the epic swords is supposed to be real good at this.
