    Solid AC, lowish HPs, and the resists need work (like you said). Some
suggestions:

Electrum Black Sapphire earrings in for the Cougar Claws. Blue Diamond
Electrum earrings for resist gear, although they're weak on the "big three"
(Fire, Cold, Magic) resists.
Dragon Tooth Choker in for the Spider Fur Collar.
Would normally swap out the mask, but I'm guessing you're a nightblind race
so leave it in.
Your bracers are weak. Any of the following could help: Guardian Bracer (No
Drop), Sentry Bracer, Indicolite Bracers (these have 21 points of resists
EACH, highly recommended, No Drop), Silver Chitin Wristband (starting to get
expensive). If you decide to go with Blue Diamond gear for resists, Velium
Blue Diamond Bracelets.
Might look at picking up Crystal Chitin arms to replace the Indicolite, but
that's a minor swap at best.
Others have mentioned upgrading haste. That'll be expensive and won't likely
help in other areas (HPs/AC/resists), but consider it.
Get a Runed Bone Fork for ranged when you need resists. Having a Crown of
the Froglok King for when you need resists is also a good idea.

    That should clean out the bank account. :-)
