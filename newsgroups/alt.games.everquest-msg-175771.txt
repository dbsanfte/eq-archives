The main reason I decided to become a terrorist is to try and challenge the
terrorist act and hopefully somehow expose it for what it is.

The truth is that nearly everyone who is convicted of a crime is now
considered a terrorist not just the real terrorists, you could merely have
an argument with your wife and be considered a terrorist for that and hauled
off to prison.
