Well, this thread has the group fired up almost as much as my faux pas
thread of a few weeks ago regarding the term Drow...

Anyway, as most people have already expressed, I'm pretty sure none of us
believe that you had anyone waiting for you.  My reasoning is this
however...  I have a higher level friend that will sometimes PL me.  HE does
the pulling.  How crazy is it for a high level person to tell a low level,
"You go get something and I'll wait WAY the hell over here for you to run it
back"?  That's NOT the way PL works.  That's the way CR's work however...

Those people at the Wedding had every right to be there (although I question
their Intelligence) as anyone else.  And they had as much right to NOT be
trained as anyone else in any zone.  No matter how irritating you find
weddings, you had no business running in an overpull to them to get some
help.  That is what you originally stated btw...

How absolutely ridiculous you are expecting others to save your ass.

I am not sure what you expected from your original post, but I hope sympathy
was not your goal.
