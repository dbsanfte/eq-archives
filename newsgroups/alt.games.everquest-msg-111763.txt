What card are you using now? If you have GF3 (or even a GF2 with 64mbs
of memory) the 8500 will not boost your EQ performance by very much.
The game is a MASSIVE resource pig with all settings maxed out.

I am running with all settings maxed out and I only have problems
(some slowing and stutters due to framerate hits) with a couple of
zones (Shar Vahl, Bazaar). I also turn off spell effects and Luclin
models when raiding, but this is pretty typical even on the most
powerful systems.

My system:
Athlon 1.2ghz
512mb PC133 SDRAM 
Radeon 8500 (250/250)
WinXP
Beta Drivers 6.13.6071 from www.rage3d.com
Redeonator Tweaking program
RefreshRate Fixer 0.9.9.6 for Radeon 8500 under WinXP

EQ settings:
1024x768 (100mhz refresh rate)
32bit color
Texture Quality = HIGH
Luclin Models = ALL ON
All other settings maxed

Tweaker settings
Aniso filtering for D3D set to 16X
Smoothvision (FSAA) disabled
All other recommended performance settings.
