Before and since PoP I used to use my main (62 druid) as a main healer for
groups. I did a lot of partnering and trioing with her from lvl 50 on, and
after PoP made its entrance I started building 5 or 6 person groups.
Druids are really fun to play, aside from the obvious appeal of travel pre
PoP, they are very versatile. I don't know why so many people don't use them
as main healers and prefer instead to solo or work up DD skills. KEI is
pretty much a necessity these days, even for a good cleric, but I have
learned to make do with a regular clarity, or only mod rods, if there's
nothing convenient. I never found it to be a struggle unless we were trained
to keep my group healed. Normal set up: 1 big tank, 2 DPS artists, 1 slower,
1 nuker, 1 healer. Plug in your preferences =)
