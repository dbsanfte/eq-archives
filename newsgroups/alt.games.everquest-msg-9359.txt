Huh.  How odd.

I can't think of any way besides going to SolB.  Remember, you don't have to
HUNT in SolB, you just have to get on their hate list.  That's a piece of
cake.  Just enter SolB and /ooc that you'll be PUNCHING (almost guaranteed
not to give you ANY chance of KSing) any kobold you see folks beating on,
simply for faction.  I seriously doubt if anyone would have a problem with
that as long as you don't accidentally train them (and assuming you're
polite when you mention your intent, of course).
