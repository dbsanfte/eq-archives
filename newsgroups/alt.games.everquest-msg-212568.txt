I tend to think of this life as "going to school".  We've got something
to learn, and this is how god teaches.  Life may seem like an inefficient
way for god to teach us something, but if life is eternal, then even a
billion years at school is, essentially, instantaneous.  And any suffering
we do in this life is really infinitely tiny and we shouldn't really
worry about it.

There's no such thing as an F, either (in my opinion).  Perhaps you have
to go BACK to school (reincarnation?  I don't believe in it, but it's
possible).  Or perhaps if you don't do well in this school, you go to
another kind of school.  Or perhaps this life, this school, is perfectly
tailored to the needs of each individual soul.

Who knows?  At this point, I think you just have to trust god to do the
right thing.

Ack, I sound dangerously religious there.  It's just my personal belief
system, and it could be wrong, and it'd be foolish for me to pretend I
know what god wants and thinks.  It's just what makes sense to me.
