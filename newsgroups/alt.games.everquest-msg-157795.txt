I just think they needed something to sue someone about.. that kid had
mental difficulties before he shot himself OR EVEN GOT ON EQ!!! No one paid
attention to when the report said he had been depressed long before his EQ
days. Hell, personally I think he looked long and hard at his cluttered and
nasty appartment and decided since he didn't wanna clean it, he would just
kill himself instead...THAT PLACE WAS A DISASTER!
I don't mean to make lite of his death but DAMN lady... teach your kid how
to function in society adn they won't kill themselves..

He just had Issues other than EQ!
But that is my 2cp....

Dogett (female Iksar) lvl 43 and lovin it!
