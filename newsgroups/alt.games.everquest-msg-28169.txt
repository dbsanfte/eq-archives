Here's the simple fact:  Most top end guilds do what they do not
because of loot, but merely for the act of "killing" stuff.

Do you really think guilds like FoH/LoS killed Vulrak and AoW for
their loot?

On our server, we have guilds whose sole purpose of existence appears
to be to farm easy stuff.  Personally, that sorta thing bores me to
tears.

Aaryonarr appears to be a kind of measuring stick.  Yelinak followed
by Aaryonarr followed by Ventari and after him either Vulrak/Vyemm or
AoW.  Good for that guild who is just beginning to "feel out"
Aaryonarr, I wish them luck.  Aaryonarr certainly is an annoying
dragon.
