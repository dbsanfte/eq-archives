Yesterday during the patch I got a message saying that the login server 
was down probably due to a patch in progress.

This morning, though, I could get to the login server fine, but all 
world servers were listed as Down.

Thats 7:30 am EST, or 3:30 am Pacific

I saw a rumor that the servers would be down last night to patch 
something to do with AAs.  When I logged out at 12:30 pm EST they were 
still up and serverwide messages suggested they would be dropping 
anytime soon, thats 9:30pm pacific, so I suppose they must have decided 
to wait till the wee hours of the morning to do it.
