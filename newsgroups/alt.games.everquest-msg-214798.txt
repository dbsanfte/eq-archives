Well... I missed the release of LDoN due to my PC's monitor being 
mercilessly hogged by the Playstation 2, so I'm a bit late to the party, 
but at least I'd like to show up well dressed, so to speak.

I've so far neglected to quest for the LoY Druid spells, which I believe 
are poison and disease cures... How necessary are these for LDoN? Also, 
should I spend money on Blessing of Replenishment (high-level group 
regeneration)? I have around 5k in the bank, and buying it would wipe me 
out, but I will if it will make a difference.
