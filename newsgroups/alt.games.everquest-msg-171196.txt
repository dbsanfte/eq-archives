Most Mormon prayer and worship takes place in the various meeting places in
town.  Walk into any of them during a service, and you'll see them pray.

I'm thinking more about derivation of power.  No subordinate can have more
power than the person or group from whom he derives his power.  Principals
derive their power from the school boards, who derive their power from the
mayor or city council, both of whom recieve their power from the state
constitution.  I'm pretty certain just about every state will have religious
rights similar to the U.S. Constitution.  Even if it were not so, the
"seperation of church and state" is based on the First Ammendment of the
U.S. Constitution, so that's where I'm going to show that it doesn't apply
to this case.
