In re-reading my first reply, I find I have not answered your
questions.

Pigs are still used to find truffles in both France and Italy (where,
by the way, they are both native). But dogs are the preferred method
to finding truffles, since they are cheaper to keep and can be put in
a car much easier.

Truffles rely on animals to sniff them out, dig them up, and eat them
in order to be dispersed. Pigs are one vector for truffle dispersal.
In the Pacific Northwest, at least 60 different species of animal are
known to eat truffles.

Only sows are used to hunt truffles. Sows are attracted to the aroma.
And at least the French Black truffle contains pheromone-like
compounds, which can arguably be called aphrodisiacs. Boars are bored
by truffles, because the aroma is similar to what a boar smells like.
A sow which eats a truffle is more likely to procreate, thus producing
more piglets which are also likely to find truffles interesting and
edible.

And because in Europe as early as the 13th Century, a papal encyclical
proclaimed that priests or nuns which ate truffles should not be held
accountable for breaking their vows of chastity, truffles in Europe
have  along history of being magical and desireable. Napoleon
supposedly asked one of his generals how he had so many children
(while Napoleon was trying to produce an heir). His general replied
that a meal including truffles usually did the trick.

Napoleon supposedly fed Josephine truffles, and less than 10 months
later he had an heir.

Please don't ask me to verify this tale. I wasn't there at the time.
