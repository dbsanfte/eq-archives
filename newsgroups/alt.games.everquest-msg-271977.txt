Actually, they are. There's a 'kill 15 highwyamen' quest you get from
a wanted poster, and I'm pretty sure there's 'kill random undead' or
'kil calthoris(blah)' quests. That's why I mentioned them.

Those are the 'jobs' referred to in the passage you posted.

BTW, writs can be done without a guild. They gain you personal status
points, so you can buy certain items and get a reduced rent on the
'cool' houses.
