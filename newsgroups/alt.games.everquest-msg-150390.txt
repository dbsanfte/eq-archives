Got called away - to elaborate

We were talking about grouping - we weren't talking
about raids or when the shit hits the fan - you
took us there.  Obviously I'm not sitting with multiple
mobs in camp.  With ONE mob in camp I'd better be
sitting - or no mana for nukes/coh/rods/malosi
(CoH saved our puller several times today when he'd
get snared in UP on his way back and get an add)

This is when an add shows up and drops 500 of my hp 
in one combat round - shammy steps in and draws
aggro, pulls the add away and parks it.  This is when
I expect a remedy or chloroblast.  You're saying
let it heal naturally, but don't sit down.  I wait for
1st mob to get down a bit then  go on a steady burn
(hate multiple 55+ mobs in camp at once - makes me 
nervous.  I am the one person in that group who can
drastically shorten the first fight.) at the cost
of having to med through 3/4 of the next fight to
get a decent reserve - so I'm forced to sit again to
be ANY use in following fights. 

Now, you haven't healed me - and a 2nd add shows up,
this time the shammy isn't as fast - bang bang bash,
bang bang - i'm down another 700hp and that thing isn't
going to follow anyone off me again - one more combat
round and I'm dead.

We never got a 2nd roamer add - only a 1st one twice
in 4 hours, but they sure didn't let me stay vulnerable
just because we might have gotten away with it.

If you can't heal me during a routine pull situation -
then it's not routine.  Single adds are routine, and
there's no reason I shouldn't sit as soon as the first
mob is dead and the 2nd solidly engaged.  The entire
time in UP I never drew aggro through nuking (the necro
did - those things did not like being turned into
skele's :)  My ranger buddy and I have played together
a VERY long time - I am quite aware of just how fast
I can nuke and not pull aggro off him.  But it is quite
common for me to be the first target of an add - and
not healing me expeditiously means I can't sit for fear
of another add showing up and doing for me.  That 
drastically reduces how much I can help the group.  

You keep throwing up "if I have to decide between the
MT, Puller, chanter etc etc" ad nauseum argument - 
I don't expect top off heals in that case - I'm standing,
I'm NOT the target of their aggro because I focus on
the MT's target.  If a healer doesn't top off that few
hundred hp during routine situations - then they aren't
going to group with me - they force me into the choice of
being more effective (medding with a mob in camp) or 
standing all the bloody time to be safe.  That's not
good for the group or me.
