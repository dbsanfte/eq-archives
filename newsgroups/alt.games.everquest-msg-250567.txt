I'm not playing eqoa, but eq. I bought the EQ Evoluiton 3 cd-rom set
a couple of weeks ago. And the Discord one last week.

okay.

all of my characters are half-elf warriors; 3rd, 4th, or 5th level.

Hmm. Hiding behind cover is better, and okay, in all other rpgs I've
played in. I'll have to remember that taking cover is not allowed in
EQ.
