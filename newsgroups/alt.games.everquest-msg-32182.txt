    Are you an airhead, too? ;-) I'm lucky - as a dwarf female, when my hat
disappears I look better. Only hat I've seen that I'd want on my head is the
Velious custom helm, and even that some folks laugh at. But they won't be
laughing when I put on my white robe and tell R2 to get this message to
Obi-Wan!

    Elder Teir'Dal = Kobold. On my skills list, it's listed as Elder
Teir'Dal, but anything written in Kobold falls under that skill. And they
are a neat item - the entire history of the Kobold nation.

    Again, could be because at one time it was "kobold". Don't know why some
of the languages were changed - maybe for flavour reasons with the research
texts?

    If they made the alternate item the same as the normal item, ayup.
Supposedly they're tinkering with the WLC to be able to do just that - have
some Lore items, say, drop normally where others poof. I hope they are
successful - at least then fixing broken quests will be quick and relatively
painless.
