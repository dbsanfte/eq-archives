Tier 2 is longer duration and better regen than Tier 1.  We won't know
the real differences until the big patch in January when they add the
food/drink effects to the descriptions.  I'm not sure about Tier 3 or
4, but I did see somebody taking orders for Tier 4 drinks that lasted
90mins - Tier 2 Refreshing OJ lasts 104mins, so I hope the regen is
just absolutely ridiculous.
