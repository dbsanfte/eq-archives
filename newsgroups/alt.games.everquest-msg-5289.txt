Heh, this might sound dumb but some very easy, safe coin can be earned right
in the newbie zones. Bone chips are selling for 3-5 plat a stack and you can
kill enough skellys in 15 mins to make a stack. If ya see a bear blast his
ass and maybe you get a HQ bear pelt which a tailor may pay 80-100 plat for.
Kill spiders and combine thier silks to make swatches (stackable) which you
can sell to tailors for some good profit, I think 10-15p a stack or so. East
Karana is good for the spider thing at your level because you can get
experience while you're doing it. Some spiders drop up to 6 silks each
there.
