I limit my 56k modem to 33.6 with a command string when playing on the net.

As you (maybe?) know a 56k modem brings info to you at the best speed
available tp to 56k, but information going from you only goes at 33.6

When playing at 56k on first person shooters the lag spikes & warping etc
were atrocious.

At 33.6 no problems (apart from the usual)

Havent removed the command string to play EQ at 56k yet though. will give it
a try.
