I got illusion Iksar by myself at level 33. Me and another enchanter and 4
other guys got together to do it at 20. We agreed we'd roll on each drop.
Got the mane, heart of ice, and powder fairly easily. We spent 6 hours and
got one Ton warrior totem, which he won. Finally, the other people were
giving up, so I just stuffed the junk in my bank and forgot about it. Even
with Iksar up 50% of Cabalis is still KOS to me anyway. And it gives no
regen. So I don't really care.
