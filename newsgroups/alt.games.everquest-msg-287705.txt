Different from TBC, there comes a new item named Glyphs. It can be
created through the new Inscription profession, they allow you to
change the stats or mechanics of your spells by slightly modifying
their stats.

In your spell book, you will find the new Glyphs interface allowing
you to access 6 Glyphs :
3 Major Glyphs - Major Glyphs will most of the time modify your spell
with powerful upgrades like a damage or range increase, or even
additional effects to your existing spells.

3 Minor Glyphs - Minor Glyphs will mostly provide cost reductions for
spells (Mana or Reagents) and also a few cosmetic changes.
After buying your Glyph at the Auction House or from an inscriber, you
will have to be near a Lexicon of Power to use it (this is a forge-
like item available near most of the Inscriptions trainer).

When you use a Glyph on a slot, the Glyph is destroyed and the effect
added to this slot. You can also overwrite old inscriptions and
replace your old effect with a new one whenever you want.

Glyphs are unlocked through leveling and if the Live 3.0.2 version
match the Beta one, you should be able to use 2 Major Glyphs and 3
Minor Glyphs at level 70 on live servers, this is still unconfirmed
though :

Level 15 : 1 Major / 1 Minor
Level 30 : 2 Major / 1 Minor
Level 50 : 2 Major / 2 Minor
Level 70 : 2 Major / 3 Minor
Level 80 : 3 Major / 3 Minor
