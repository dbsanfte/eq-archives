Honestly, Sony didn't do anything to them. I bought the book shortly after
it came out, and was instantly disappointed.

Reasons?

1) There are no loc identifiers on the map pages ... just a top down 3/4
view of the zone

2) Obvious errors ... Dreadlands has a monster level of 1 - 10? After which
pipe?

3) I could have sworn that there was mention of quest listings ... none are
to be found.

There are a few others, but you get the idea. The only real benefit of the
Atlas is that it has maps of the zones that EQAtlas doesn't (like Chardok,
Sirens Grotto, Velks Lab), and if you get into the history of Norrath, the
Atlas is full of it.
