Ability to tank is not about who would win in a duel.  Ability to tank is
about being able to hold aggro, and take damage.  You cannot exclude spells
from this, that is part of being able to perform the job.  Given a choice
between a monk and a ranger for a tank, I would take the ranger.  Given a
choice between a monk and a ranger for damage dealer, I would take the monk.
