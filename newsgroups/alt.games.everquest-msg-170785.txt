When I druid PL I take the following route. 

Level 1 to 20 P Caverns - Avoid the bandits and stick with the other
mobs. They don't run and normally very few people are hunting them.

Low 20's to low 30's - The Overthere - Exp here is not as good as many
other zones but you can pull non stop and it's rare that you will be
killed by trains that are far to common in most of the dungeon zones.

Low 30's to 50 - Dreadlands- Start at Yeti caves on south wall and
work your way towards the harder mobs.

May not be the quickest but this route has given me the least amount
of aggravation.

Your setup is fine. I would make an assist hotkey for a snare and
nuke. Also keep an open group invite to one of your toons and keep LS
up in case you need to Evac because of a train or bad pull.

As far as not knowing how to play the class...I agree with the last
post there are plenty of people running around at 50 plus who have no
idea how to play their characters that weren't powerleveled.  Bard's
and Chanter's probably aren't the best classes to start playing in
groups for the first time post 40 but I did it with a chanter and
haven't had any complaints.

Personally I would stick to combo's that allow you to dual box when
you can't find groups, don't feel like being social or don't have a
lot of time.

I have taken a Cleric/Warrior and a Druid/Warrior combo post 50. I
have a Shammy/Monk combo that is approaching 40 and just started a
Mage/BL and Druid/Necro to try something new.
