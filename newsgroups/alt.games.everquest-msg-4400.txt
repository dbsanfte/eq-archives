They threw in a new one this time: disconnect most people on all servers
about 40 minutes before the scheduled patch, and then broadcast a
message to the chat server saying that if you are having trouble logging
back in, reboot your computer and wait 5 minutes.  I was surprised they
didn't also ask us to sacrifice a chicken and do something with goat
entrails.

The nice thing about the timing is that 40 minutes before the patch
catches a lot of people who are traveling to where they want to camp
out, so they can experience that "I went LD while running...wonder where
I'll end up?" feeling.

The good news is that they did broadcast an announcement that the GMs
would res anyone who died due to this outage.
