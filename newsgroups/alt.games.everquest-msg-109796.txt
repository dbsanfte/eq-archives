The permanence of items which enter the game is one of the
things that causes the economy in EQ to deteriorate over time.

DAoC has item decay built in, it's not that much of a problem.

I don't think it would be a good idea to retroactively put it
in a game, but if the game is designed from the get go around
it, it's not that bad.
