If you have a "faded" page, you just put it in your book alone and hit
combine. If sucessful you will get a regular page, and probably one of the
rarer ones. If 2 Faded pages stack, they will turn into the same page on a
sucessful combine. Faded pages that don't stack turn into different pages on
a successful combine. You can also get skill-up's restoring faded pages that
aren't trivial.
