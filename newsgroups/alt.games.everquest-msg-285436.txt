The most minor of nitpicks: sure there is "pick up hockey".  I haven't
played in years, but used to be we'd go to the town pond that was
frozen over and play with whoever was there.  There were some
generally accepted rules (no checking, no slapshots, play nice) but
certainly the skills varied from people who could barely skate to
people who had played in college.  As long as people followed the
"play nice" rule it generally worked.
