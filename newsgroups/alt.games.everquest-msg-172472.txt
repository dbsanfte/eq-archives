The expansion files go into the main EQ directory, not into 
subdirectories, so it looks like whatever the problem is, that's not it. :(

As long as you have the original CDs, and as a last resort, I would 
perhaps delete the EQ .dll files, and then run the program again and 
have the patcher re-download them, but I'd probably wait until I've 
exhausted all other advice.

Good luck!
