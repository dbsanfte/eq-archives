I had mastered baking (Got to be very careful how you say that) by level
6 on an untwinked character. All I did was save all the cash I could,
and then head to FP to buy fish and bat and sauce. I had saved about 4pp
via simple quests and lots of killing. That 4pp got me to master baker
*and* made me "infinate" pp. <G>. I actually ended up with a complete
set of back packs (Bank and body) + one spit, 2 back packs full of baked
goods to sell and 40pp. I then headed out to loio, ww, fm etc. and sold
my banquetes for a nice profit. Of cause at level 6 I got some odd looks
too. 

My baking has now funded my other trade skills, making me a master
potter (to build a full set of baking utensils) an average smith and a
near master brewer, and all by level 17.

I have never made a sandwich or any bread (Though now that I have a
bread tin I will be starting).

I never made edible goo either, the money is more valuable that the
skill-up.

I have made some stat food, but not enough to start selling it yet.

HTH all bakers,

Jim
