Subject: Anyone know how to create a chat window?

I see on some screenshots from other players where they have their chat in one
window and their melee'ing or fighting hits and misses and etc in another
window.  I'd sure like to be able to do this since I'm finally getting tired of
watching tells and guild chat fly by at a rate that I barely see much less have
time to read.  Hate scrolling up after every fight to see if I missed anything
important.  How hard is this to do?  Does it require loading a custom UI or is
there a simpler way.  TIA.
