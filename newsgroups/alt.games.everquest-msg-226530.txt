   Topics always go off on a tangent if they last past 3 or so replies, I
believe.  I don't think that SOE is really ripping anyone off, considering that
people who go in on this promo know exactly what they are paying $50 for. 
Namely, a guaranteed slot in a highly anticipated beta.  Oh, and a crappy RTS
that not too many people seem that interested in on its own.

    Good marketing?  You bet.  I haven't seen anyone who says that it isn't. 
Unlawful?  I don't think I've seen anyone allege that either.  What we are
saying though, is that it is tacky of them to do it this way.   I can't speak
for everyone else, of course, but the reasons I feel this way are that it is in
effect making people who want a guaranteed beta slot pay for the privilege of
testing their product for them.  I guess I'm terribly old fashioned, but I feel
that a company should budget for this sort of thing in their R&D budget, rather
than seeing how much money they can get out of their customer base in this
regard.  Also, they are effectively charging $50 for a guaranteed beta slot. 
This is similar in price to what many fully developed games cost.

   Still, it's not a rip off.  People who go in on this know full well what they
are paying for (oh, and they get a crappy RST that no one seems to care very
much about).  Heck, I'd really like to be in beta, and I'm thinking about doing
this.  After all, I'd have a chance (I know, a remote chance) of having some
sort of positive influence on the final form of the game.  And I don't hold any
great hope in winning the great  EQII beta test lottery.  This would be the
best, albeit expensive, shot I would have at getting it.

    So.  Not ripping off.  Not illegal. Good marketing.  Tacky.
