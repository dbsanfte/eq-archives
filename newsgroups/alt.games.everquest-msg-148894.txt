Maybe that would possibly be a good idea to pass up all the newbie
levels and start out as a lvl 20 with one of those reimb packs the GMs
give out. But not the exp boost. Starting a character at lvl 20 would
save some time which would otherwise be tiring hours of exping up
unless that was what you wanted a newbie for. But exp boost would give
you an advantage over people big time which would probably lead to
tons of complaints. Even thought you did work yourself all the way up
there, to people who just play lower level character that don't go
past like level 30 because of the frustration of exp would be insanely
pissed I'd say.
