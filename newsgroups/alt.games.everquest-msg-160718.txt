I've been a long time ghost here, prefer not to post often anywhere.  But I
though you all as longtime EQ players would like to see this. I ran a search
under Google for Edward Castronova, PHD  whom they quoted in the article
above.  Found the link to his paper at the following site:

http://business.fullerton.edu/ecastronova/bio.htm

If you are even partially interested in the economics of everquest this is a
fascinating look at Norrath, really worth the read if you can get past all
the PHD stuff. (I'm not an economist and some of it was a little dry)  I
would like to see a follow up report on how the dynamics of EQ economy have
changed with the creation of the bazaar.

Cheers!
