Quite correct.  Now, as you're the first fish to bite, I'll provide
you with a challenge:

What is the meaning of "celibacy"?

DO NOT simply respond saying what you THINK it means.  Go get a copy
of the OED and look it up, then post here with what you found.

Do keep in mind that it (now) has a secondary meaning associated with
it, due to rampant ignorance on the part of the population.  I want
the *primary* meaning.  In other words, look at both "celibacy" and
"celibate".
