Okay not sure what level it "becomes trivial" and you always hide when
pressing the hide button, but I would say it was in the teens at the
latest.  You do practice hide all the time when your sitting waitign for
a pull etc, like you do with sense heading or similar skills.  You
should be able to be bound there, and in such a place that even if you
failed hide initially you could try again.  Sneak and hide are a rogues
best friends, use them often.
