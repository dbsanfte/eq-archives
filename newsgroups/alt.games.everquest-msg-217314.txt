But they are pointless.
1) They don't assist you actually making anything.

2) Unless you surf the web you are unlikely to know they exist, or how 
to get them. Discovering them "in-game" without outside help can be a 
major chore. Like looking for needles in a haystack, without actually 
knowing their are any needles in their. How can you search for 'Mixy's 
Delicacies Vol 6" if you don't know its in the game. The NPCs mention 
just a few of them; over all its pretty rare.

3) Once you are surfing the web, finding out what books are available, 
and where to get the books, you might as well just read the book online 
too. Because it doesn't do you your character any good to actually have 
them.

A carpenter learns to make a chair... then someone says hey can you make 
a table?... and he looks at you blankly never tried that before... but I 
can try... lets get some wood, and nails, and a hammer and see what 
happens... poof... hmmm... maybe i need more wood... poof... nails? not 
enough nails...? poof? bat fur... of course... poof... more bat fur? 
ok... Success!!!... So-and-so has successfully crafted a padded wagon... 
Hmmmm!!!

That's my point. People don't find recipes for 'new items' they decide 
they want to make something, and then figure out how to make it. They 
start with the end result in mind.

I don't take metal bits, bat fur, and water and put it in a bowl to see 
what happens... I say I want to make a jewelled choker... I'll need some 
metal, water, jewels. I'm not going to end up with a bejewelled dagger 
hilt of ogre slaying by accident.

Sure **sometimes**, neat stuff *is* found while looking for other stuff, 
but then its usually along the lines of ... hey this jeweled choker I'm 
working on isn't quite long enough to be a choker, but it would make a 
great bracelet if I just... "something".

So to find everything we're back to true trial and error.

So now instead of waiting for skillups we're waiting for it to tell us 
what is actually needed to succeed. Its a shift sideways, not better.

  And this way

I actually have little interest in emulating trial and error, via a 
carpel tunnel clicking system. Trial and error isn't fun. Give me a 
system where my level of skill gives me recipes... at 10th I know how to 
make X, at 11th I know how to make Y...or make it a civ-like tech tree, 
  and let me advance through it that way choosing what I learn to make 
at each skillup/AApoint/Tradeskill point/whatever, and give me droppable 
recipes that I can read like spells, and 'learn' (once I het a certain 
required prereq skillevel). And once my character knows how to make 
something...let me make it by seleciting the recipe, let the game sift 
through my inventory to see if I've got what i need. And let me make 
more than one at a time (even if it 'takes time' to cycle then)...



On another note:

I'm pretty sure if I took some metal bits, some jewels, and some water 
and tried to make a choker, even if it didn't work, I'd still have metal 
bits, and jewels at the end of it.

And:

I'd rather see 'varying' quality items result from failures. From dismal 
to excellent. An occasional poof is ok...thoguh I'd have to screw 
something up pretty bad to poof the entire thing... (except maybe with 
baking or alchemy... but even then I should get the bottle or pie plate 
back... most of the time :)
