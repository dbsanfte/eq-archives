Well... I have to agree with the earlier poster to a point... either 
travelling should be slow or fast... nobody is going to take a boat from 
freeport to kaladim over 20 minutes when they can book up and down to 
the pok in a minute flat. There really isn't much point.

I liked the luclin spires. They were a nice compromise. The pok books 
are just silly. Hell... the whole pok is just silly.
