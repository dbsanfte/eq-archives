If you have Velious...I would suggests Eastern Wastes.
Awesome Loot! Compared to OT.

Though to be honest...30 might be a bit early for that zone (unless
you can get Sow & Invis to travel)...but I did group with a few
characters that were 28-30, so I guess in a group - you are safe.

Velious Weapon drop are common and sell to vendors about 4PP (I think
if you had the mind to- you could auction these for about 10PP or so
in EC- not sure though, markets change all the time).

Another thing I like about the Velious Weapons is that you can use for
new characters and make life a bit easier when hunting wisps.

Ult Tusks...people buy these all the time for about 40PP.

I've made about 200PP so far just playing on an off for a few days.

I'm in a hell level as you (35), and I got sick of the chain pulling
that goes on in OT, so I needed a break.

Glad I hit Velious- has been fun.
