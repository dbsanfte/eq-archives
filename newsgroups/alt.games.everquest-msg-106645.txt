>>> Is it possible to transfer my character from one server to another?
     I started on Firiona Vie <<<

Unfortunately, no. Here's the link in case you want to read about it:

https://store.station.sony.com/eq_char_moves/

but the part you are interested in is this...

<quote>
Characters will not be moved to or from the following servers: The Test
Server, Sullon Zek Server and Firiona Vie
</quote>

However, you should try starting a new character on the European server.
Why? Because the rules are not as strict on the Euro server as the FV
server, so you can group with anyone, anyone can buff you, anyone can talk
to you, etc, etc

So try it anyway, you might make level 10 by summer :)
