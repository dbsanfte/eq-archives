I called VI and low and behold there is an issue with PORT TRIGGERING on the
linksys routers. Here is the fix.
1 Log into the router from your browser
2 click the ADVANCED tab
3 click on the FORWARDING tab
4 click on PORT TRIGGERING
5 put a name like EQ ro Everquest for ap name
6 put in BOTH trigger and incoming port fields 1024 7000
7 since i have done this i have not had any problems.
