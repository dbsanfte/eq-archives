So, basically, we agree.  DoN equipment is sufficient for hitting RSS, 
but there are snobs who don't think so.

There are also quite a few non uber guild players in the game who are 
happy to hit RSS, and will take less well equipped people with them.

The problem here is not gear availability, it's player attitude.
