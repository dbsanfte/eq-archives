Depends on what you want, and what OS you are using.

If you have Win 98/SE/ME, you don't want to have over 512MB RAM total
anyway.

If you have Win2K/XP, you won't get as big a performance upgrade from
512-768 as you will from 256-512.

The 16MB graphics card is a bigger hindrance to you than the 256MB system
RAM, but you would get a better overall performance boost from upgrading the
video to a modern 32MB video card and the RAM to 512MB than from either a
64MB video card or 768MB total system RAM.

You might also want to look here:

You may be able to get yourself a 256MB RAM stick * and * a nice GeForce4 Ti
4200 64MB DDR video card for little more than the price of the video card at
a local computer shop. Be careful you know * exactly * what you need, there
is no tech support at pricewatch.
