Three VERY well equipped and drilled groups might be able to take Nagafen
down. For your first attempt you probably want more like 5-6 groups. Make
them melee heavy, lotsa clerics, and grab as many L52 Wizards as you can
(Lure of Frost). Then make sure your Resists are up to scratch (this is a
PvP server so I guess you all prolly have quite good resists). Aim for a
MINIMUM of about 100 unbuffed resist to Magic and Fire. I preferred to focus
on Magic in my first Nag fights cos it was the Fears that turned them into
routs. The fire breath hurts, but that can be healed. Fear just makes all
your planning pointless as everyone runs like headless chickens :)
Oh, and the fire breath dispels buffs as well if you dont resist it, so put
some junk-buffs up in the top slots.
So then you just fight him in his lair. Call the nukers in at about half
life (less if you only have a couple of them). And good luck ;)
