I just recently created a Troll Warrior, and am happily chopping away at 
newbie creatures like snakes, spiderlings, wolves and such with amy 2H Axe.
Occasionally I switch over to my Bloodforge Hammer wich a very, very kind 
bard gave to me, to shed some light on my path while I am chopping away.

Thing is, I am now nearly lvl 5 and I've seen NO improvement in either 2H 
slashing or 2H blunt. Is this normal?? I've finally spent 5 points into the 
basiscs off all my weapon skills, 1H slashing, 2H slashing, 1H blunt, 2H 
blunt, and piercing. But even after that I've seen no advancement in any of 
these skills, even though I'm using quite some different weapons and 
killing a lot of blue and yellow critters.

Anyone able to shed a light on this poor confused troll ???
