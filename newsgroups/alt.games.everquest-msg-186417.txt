Do you believe everything you're told? How about every bit of 
misinformation that multiple people are circulating? Neither do I without 
an explanation that satisfies my own skepticism.

Who do you think you are to chime in on a thread I start with legitimate 
questions, basically telling me to accept what's being said and stop 
posting about it?! Fuck off, you arrogant punk-ass bitch.

If you don't like the fact that I challenge a particular bit of 
information I'm given, too bad. So I require a bit more convincing than 
you may think should be necessary. Again I ask, who do you think you are 
to decide that I require too much?! Stay the hell out of the thread if 
you feel that way.

You guess that I would "argue with a brick about the weather". Well, I'm 
guessing that you never miss an opportunity to flay someone in an effort 
to build up your online image in a subconscious effort to compensate for 
severe real life deficiencies - not the least of which I'd wager would be 
a lack of social skills.

The telling sign is the fact that you started your little high-horse 
tirade by replying to my post that was about the lease argumentative of 
them all.
