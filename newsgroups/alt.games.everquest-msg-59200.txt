oh yes jazzmanian!

nothing better than to, log in spend an hour trying to get my 56th war a
ride, then an hour or more waiting for others to get to ToV, then another
hour to set up groups/buff, then another two hours fighting to the juicy
mobs.

Then if we have a cool wipe out (rarely happens but does on occasion's) to
do a 1 hour CR! woot fun fun!

Then we get to the core of enjoyement post 55 where you prep for 30 mins for
a fight that will last about 90 sec's, wash rinse repeate

um same old EQ! yay !


I cant wait!


or I could play my enchanter (55) and pezz buffs and sit on my azz for an
hour till my buffs wear off and I get to repeate the proccess! woot choices
too no less wow I am so excited!

(SOL is named that for a reason)

talk all you want fanboy, but you will lose this argument
