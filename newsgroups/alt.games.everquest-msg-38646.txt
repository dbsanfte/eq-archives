You can't get 300,000 EQ players from a 120,000 player UO user base,
especially when UO goes from 120,000 to 150,000 in that same year. You can
get 300,000 EQ players from former UO who quit because they didn't find the
game to their satisfaction. The numbers I heard for "churn rate"  were no
where near 25,000 players a month.

The UO servers/land mass were also more then doubled in size. Twenty servers
that are twice as big is expansion.
