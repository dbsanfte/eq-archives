[Darklet and Bizbee, sitting in a tree...]

Naw, just kidding, Darklet. I know your true love is that hippie
wood elf from LotR, not Biz.

Well, isn't someone pretty much *always* flinging personal
attacks at him and/or stalking him across newsgroups? Always
makes me wonder how sucky a life those guys must have and/or
how starved for attention they can get... Given his posting
style and stuff, I can see how you could *dislike* him, but
the weirdos he attracts, man, it gets me thinking...
