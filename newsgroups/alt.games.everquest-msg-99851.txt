Although Iksars are cool looking and effects.  I HATE the KOS idea, and I've
tried both Monk and SK and never got above LV12.  Kunark is just way too
boaring to try to pass that LV range.  Field of Bone gets hard to find
anything not RED or green, Ill Omen is too spread out and ends up the
same...you can find a rare blue or black but thats only about every half
hour on NON-peak hunting times.
So now that you mention monk...Humans can be monks too, and the old world
still poses many challenges (running from Qeynos to Freeport or Halas to
Freeport, or Oggok to anywhere else at low LVs).  These challenges can be
overcome by planning and adventure.  The excitement of having to cut through
dangerous zones with advise other than "hug the zone line and miss seeing
the entire zone or you won't make it".  Personally I think at lower LVs,
Kunark just doesn't offer much, and even crossing higher LV zones you either
don't see them because you have to stay along the edge, or you don't even go
through them.  Antonica...well...3 words...."Kithokur", "Pass", and "Karanas
(SP?)".  Still a good planning stratagy, not too hard, not too easy, perfect
match of witt and skill and excitement.
    So what are the pros of a human monk over an Iksar monk other than
faction?  So far it is looking like either Human Monk or Wizzard of some
kind (just to try as someone else said).

Primary fighting weapon is hand to hand...so you've got your weapon with you
on a corpse run.

If I do monk, I'll keep these in mind.  I liked the Iksar ones.
