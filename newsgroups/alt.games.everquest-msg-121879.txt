Nobody asked about the world or silly comments about it being a big
scary place.

All that was asked was that you show some respect to the fact children
are present and that you respect this is a forum in which not everyone

Forward, as occasion offers. Never look round to see whether any shall note itï¿½. Be satisfied with success in even the smallest matter, and think that even such a result is no trifle.
