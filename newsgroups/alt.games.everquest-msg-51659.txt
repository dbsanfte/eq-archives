Permasowing a low level caster is, indeed, a *HUGE* freaking difference.
Often, by the time a melee type gets to the point of realizing they are
going to lose a fight or have something on them they can't handle,
they're too badly injured to try to run, even with sow.

However, a caster might be at or near full health when they realize
this, and with sow on all the time, and the experience and perspective
of a seasoned player, they would well know "when to hold them and when
to fold them".  One of the first twinkage items I plan on working on for
my wizard if/when I ever dust him off again will be to camp the AC for
j-boots for him. Between j-boots and gate, and the experience of knowing
which mobs to fight in which zones, I don't seem him dying much either.
