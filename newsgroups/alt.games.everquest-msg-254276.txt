The "Average Joe" player was always able to reach Veeshan's Peak.  It
was really super easy to go through and do for quite some time now,
especially since Trakanon and other Kunark events aren't taken up by
high tier raiding guilds.  The quest for the new key has not been
posted yet, so we don't know how much easier or hearder this new key
will be.  Just work at it with your "Average Joe" time and you'll reach
your goal in no time.  You didn't need an uber raiding guild to get the
key for the old VP.
