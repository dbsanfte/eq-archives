I met ( through GuildChat ) two new people in our small guild on Saturday, 
a 42 War and 35 Drd.  Our 40 CLC leader logged in and as I was camping, he 
and the War started talking about doing the Avatar of Fear, which I had 
brought up a while back.  Last thing I heard was "How about around 12:30 
tomorrow?"  I didn't really thing they were too serious about it, but I was 
logged in about noon with Drag, who I had run to Dalnirs.

On the nose, the War logs on at 12:30, and brings it up.  I was semi-
shocked, because I -really- thought they were kidding.  Well, we had:

35 ENC, 40 CLC, 42 WAR, and 35 DRD.  We were all spread out, but all 
started heading towards Cazic ( Zym was in Shadowhaven ).  It took us a 
good 30-45 minutes, but we all made it there, and the WAR had a 39 CLC 
friend who wanted to come along so we sent the DRD after her.  While we 
were waiting for the 2 of them to show, the other 3 of us went down and 
found the Steel Golem up.  We killed gators ( got the shovel ) and were 
about to pull the Golem when the DRD and CLC made it to Cazic, so I went to 
get them to take out the Golem.  A little after I left, the War pulled him 
anyway.  I got back just in time to tash and nuke for the kill =)

We made our way down to the AOF room, and used harmony to clean the place.  
The Troll WAR was having some problems getting through the doorway, though.  
A 51 Mage shows up and it looks like he is going to contest the AoF, since 
he was -in- the room and we were in the hallway.  Our leader is very good 
at these situation, and the Mage decided to leave if we would port him to 
WC.  Right before we take him, he kills the AOF PH.

The DRD and I decide to go so that I can bring the DRD back.  Our leader, 
the 40 CLC gets caught in the port, leaving just the 42 WAR and 39 CLC down 
there.  They should be fine.  The 3 of us run back to Cazic from the 
Feerrott ring, and in the courtyard, our leader goes LD.  He's level 40, 
invis, close to the zone line, and knows Cazic real well.  We leave him 
there after he despawns and head down to the AOF doorway.  The room has 
spawned, so we start pulling it again and kill a Cenobyte.  Then:

Druid: AOF is up.
Me: Oof, Grams ( leader ) isn't here.

We sit for a minute talking about it, and then one of them opens the door.  
I guess it was our Warrior, since he was the recipient of the 300pt HT.

"Avatar of Fear begins to cast a spell." ( something like that )
Me: /g Oh Shit.

35 ENC, 42 WAR, 39 CLC, 35 DRD  - VS - Avatar of Fear

I'm pretty sure I heard the Warrior tell the cleric to camp - will have to 
check the logs.  Even if he did, she didn't =)  AOF jumps in the room, pet 
in tow.  I mez the pet, haste the tank, tash the AOF.  War is tanking like 
crazy, and is at 1/2 life FAST ( with the HT ).  I grab 2 screenshots, one 
from the front, one from the back.  Cleric is healing, DRD casts a DS and 
started meleeing ( think ).  I tried to Slow and to Nuke, but all resisted.  
AOF at 1 bub, CLC OOM, Drd starts to heal, War is about 1/2 life.  I remez 
the pet and sit down to mem Rune III ( had planned on having it memmed 
BEFORE the battle, but didn't realize someone was going to open the door 
and start the excitement =).  I get it memmed, and the AOF is about 10% 
life.  He drops.  War dispatches the pet.  I never even runed, even though 
I thought I would have to Chain-Rune.

Leader logs back in and we give him the news.  He couldn't believe he 
missed it.

Was a BLAST!  Our new Warrior guild-mate tanked like a champ.  The 39 CLC 
was wonderful at healing and not drawing aggro.  The druid picked up 
perfectly when the CLC went OOM.  I really didn't do a lot, except watch 
for adds, pray someone lived, and prepare for the worst.  I got the 3rd 
screenshot of us all at the corpse in that small hallway before we looted 
it.

Claws, and ringmail arms =(  The Cenobyte earlier dropped the potion, and 
we let the 39 Cleric have it and I gave her the claws, too, since she saved 
our Bacon.  These 2 new additions to our Guild, the War and Drd, are 
awesome.  We decided to kill the Archon a few times, and that began the 
REAL fiaso of the day.  That's another story, and you guys don't really 
care about it.  Between there and LGuk, I had 5 deaths.  All of them 
stupid.

I think we are going to go back and try to get some Ravenscale armor.
