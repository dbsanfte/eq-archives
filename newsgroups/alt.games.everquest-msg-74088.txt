I've fixed the other problems with SoL, but this one is still bugging me and
I would appreciate a suggestion/fix, whatever. Sound works everywhere else
except in EQ... it even works logging INTO EQ (you know, that 'theme song
thingie') I can't however, get any sound at all once I've logged into the
game. Nothing that I do helps.

Any suggestions? Should I just bug VI about it? Stuff is harder to kill when
it makes no noise! :( Well, ok, it's just harder to hear.

Thanks for playing.
