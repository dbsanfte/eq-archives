No, you aren't top posting, I'd say.  Top posting is when *all* of the
substance of your reply comes above the quotes.  The reason top posting is
bad is that it makes it hard to read the reply in context.  A secondary
reason is that top posters almost never trim the quoted material.

Note that there are people who bottom post but do not trim...they quote the
entire post, and then put their reply to a small part of it below.  These
people are almost as annoying as top posters.

Hmmm...is that twinked or non-twinked?  My recollection is that at 29 and a
bit after, my mana pool was not big enough to quad.  The AOE spells are less
mana efficient per mob than regular nukes...quadding gets its efficiency
because you are doing four mobs at once.  Because of the lower per mob
efficiency, I didn't have enough mana to cast the spell enough times to kill
the mobs.  Also, I seem to recall BoF being a bit iffy at 29, because of
resists.  Of course, this was before KEI.
