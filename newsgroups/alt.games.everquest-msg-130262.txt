If we are going to dig back into history, you might want to remember that
there was a time when there were no Jews in the middle east, or anywhere
else for that matter.  Well, unless of course we are taking the bible at
face value as a complete historical document of the times.  Of course, at
that time there were also no Muslims anywhere to be found either, or
Christians for that matter.  Maybe we should see if we can find the
descendants of the people who lived there at that time, and give the land to
them?

The fact of the matter is that at this time several million Jews do live in
Israel, and quite a few Muslims live in and around Israel.  Somehow, some
sort of arrangement needs to be found that will allow them to live
peacefully side by side.  If I knew the answer to this problem, then I could
probably expect to become a recipient of the Nobel peace prize.
Unfortunately, I don't.
