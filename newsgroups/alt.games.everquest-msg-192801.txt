And what about characters who earn their pp trading gear in the bazaar?

What about characters who earn their pp hunting tradestuffs off low
level mobs and then selling them to other player characters (in bazaar
or directly)?

And what about low level characters who camped the Aqua Goblins in BBM
for hours on end before they were nerfed?

It has been a long time since it was difficult for a knowledgeable
player to acquire 1000pp on a character prior to making L11, and if
you can acquire 1000pp you can acquire 2000pp, & etc.  Barring direct
personal knowledge, you can't be confident another character is a
twink unless they're wearing gear worth 10's of thousands of pp at
very low level.  Mudflation has devalued twinking as well.
