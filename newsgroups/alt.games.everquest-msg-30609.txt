Agreed, but be aware that depending on class, etc. there are some skills
that will go up regardless of the level of the mob. A notable exception
for warriors, at least, is the disarm skill. Mine isn't quite topped out
yet (mid 190's). When I was working on faction in WC, I was clearing out
the orc camp during off hours when no newbies were camping them, and was
hitting disarm against the ones with rusty weapons and was shocked to
see a skill improvement. I also got a couple on the guards there, though
they are also non-xp giving except Valon on rare occasions.
  But, that said, I've never seen any of my weapons skills increase on a
low green.
