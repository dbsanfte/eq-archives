    It's intended, although pointless now that the TLC is gone from The
Warrens.

    Those items were available in EC, one zone away. Freeport had it pretty
good. People from Paineel have no real alternatives until you get to
Neriak/Oggok/a neutral site in an expansion. That's quite the hike!

    Yup, that was the original plan. In the modern game, though, all it does
is concentrate players in those few neutral sites that contain all the
vendors players need. If there were more supplies in other places, perhaps
players would spread out a bit more and you wouldn't get things like people
fighting over the brewing barrels in PoK. Well, the lazy ones still would.
