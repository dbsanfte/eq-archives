There is a lot of (fierce) competition for the mammoths they give pretty good
exp and the tusks sell to merchant for nice pp but they are free for all so its
just a question of getting to them first, as a ranger you have an advantage.
However if you want to try something different you can visit South Karana or
Highhold pass/keep 2 zones closeby that are relatively easy to get a group in.

Both spawn in q.hills Talym Shoontar follows the path from the wk zone to
qeynos and gnasher the other side of the path opposite blackburrow. Its
possible that gnasher is triggered (heared rumours to the effect but no real
testing) but more likely just random.
Shoontar also spawns (occasionaly) in qeynos at the fish's tavern and in
freeport at the docks you might have more luck trying to kill him there.
