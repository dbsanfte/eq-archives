The NPC in Oasis who will take Lightstones is named Sythian, and she's at
Gypsy camp.

Sythian gives you some exp and a random research book (that is, one with
research information in it - Its NOT a container) for each Lightstone, and
the Concordance of Research and some exp for a Greater Lightstone.

If anyone is around when you go to do the turn-ins, make sure you get a
Charisma buff, so you can get more money from selling the items back
afterward.
