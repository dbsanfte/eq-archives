The experience is pretty good for this quest at low level, and you can
repeat it.  Combine this with the fact that the merchants in Misty
Thicket pay a lot less for any given item than the ones in Rivervale,
and it works out very nicely.  Run half the quest, hunt in Misty
Thicket until your inventory is full, go back to Rivervale to sell and
finish the quest, then pick up the quest again and repeat.  When you
get one of those occasional lulls in mob spawning, where you just
can't seem to find anything good to kill, run the quest 5 or 6 times
while waiting.
