> Level 5 Human Cleric of Erollisi Marr Looking for solo areas near
Freeport.

Yard trash in the dirt areas of East Commonlands or North Ro, right after
you zone in from Freeport. Good for a couple more lvls, before moving into
the grass. You can actually solo into the mid-teens or so in those areas, in
fact. (Although I'd recommend trying to get a Derv group in North Ro once
you hit 10, then heading to Oasis and trying to get a couple of people to
hunt crocs with around 14 - Orc Highway is still fairly buggy)

either /lfg, which puts a LFG tag after your name for people to see, or
occasionally doing an /ooc. I don't recommend grouping until about lvl 8,
though.

No clue. Haven't used ICQ in ages, and I wouldn't leave it or any other chat
program running while in EQ, anyway.
