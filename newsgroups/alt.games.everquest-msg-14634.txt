With 3 points in it, your skill is 16. That is really, REALLY bad. But, it
goes up fairly quickly. Find a fast weapon to put offhand to get the most
chances for swings, and therefore skill improvements.

You won't start seeing your second hand go off regularly until your skill
hits 90 or so. At level 30, you will start double attacking with the second
hand as well as the first, and with your skill being 155ish, you will be
getting that second attack more often than not.
