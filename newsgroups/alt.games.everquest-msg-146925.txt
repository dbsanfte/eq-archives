I had a horse and there not worth the money, heres why.
(1) Even without sow youll be able to run nearly as fast as the cheapest 
horse, and mobs will catch you if there chasing.
(2) As your classed as sat down on a horse your more likely to keep 
getting hassle from opportunist mobs that you can kill easy but if you 
healing already the last thing you need is some wolf or skeleton trying 
there luck.
(3) If you buy one it is never worth selling it unless you have lots of 
cash because you get less than half price back on the sale of an old 
horse, personally i think there some be some trade in option for a 
better horse.
(4) You dont med or heal while sat on a horse, you heal at the same rate 
as being stood, which is stupid imo
(5) There is only 1 use for horses and that to show off in front of 
newbies and even then they go "oh look a horse, interesting"
(6) Overpriced and useless, dont waste the cash, i understand the 
ongoing cost of sow potions is more expensive you wont stop using sow 
potions when you get a horse, youll still need them cause the horse is 
too slow, oh and did i say if you are either on or off the horse then 
drink a potion it had zero effect, youll travel at the horses speed. The 
horse isnt affected by the sow potion, it is however effected by things 
like invis and will also go invis.
(7) Finally the items are no drop so you cant even try make less of a 
loss on the sale of a horse by selling it over auction, that sucks, you 
will take a 60% loss if you ever sell the horse

In summary, id save ya cash.
