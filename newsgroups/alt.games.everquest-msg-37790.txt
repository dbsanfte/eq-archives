If you assist someone who plays an AoE song and I assume spell, you will be
added to the hate list.  I had this happen to my druid in Qeynos once.  Saw a
newbie bard running to the guards, very low on life and a trail of mobs on his
butt.  I fired off a heal, and then all the guards bum rushed me.  Sucked being
bound several zones away too.  It took me a minute to figure out what had
happened, but then I realized he must have forgotten to turn of his AoE song
when he ran to the guards.  I healed him after he was on the hate list, adding
me to the hatelist.
