I can see your point. But in Verant's case it's a bit extreme. Sure, in 
a group, you make a mistake, you die, you run for your corpse.
In a raid you die, raid gets wiped out (you know, shit happens). Then a 
whole bunch of naked people spend 3-4 very frustrated hours recovering 
corpses. Many lose multiple levels and won't be rezzed afterwards. If 
you had to leave in the middle of the raid, you can't, or you won't get 
your shit back.
And that's a good thing how?
