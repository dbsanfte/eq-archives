I stopped at 175, haven't felt like going further yet, 175 was plenty good
enough for barbarian cultural armor to fill in a few holes in my armor.  175
was easy.  Shouldn't take you more than 2 to 3 hundred more combines to get
there.  Actually, I found the skillups to be much more frequent than that,
and that was with a wis in the 180s, and str around 200 at the time.
