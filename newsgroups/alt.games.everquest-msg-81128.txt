Donald Trump was given several million dollars by his father when he
went into business. Nothing moral or immoral about it. If you have
something to pass down, then that is your right.

If you roleplay, twinking can be an inheritance or a gift to give an
alt a leg up in the world of Norrath.

There are three types of twinks...

Those that can, those that can't, and those that someday will.

Trust me, when you get your main levelled up, you will not be looking
forward to spending the same amount of time bashing rats and bats with
your alts.
