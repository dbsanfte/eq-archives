Obviously our opinions are worthless so I asked a few leading world figures
what their opinion of U-God was:

"Let's face it guys - the biggest international crime at them moment is that
we are wasting time killing each other whilst complete and utter fucktards
like this are allowed to continue drawing breath unhindered." - Joint
statement: Ariel Sharon and Yasser Arafat

"I cannot remember the last time I had such an overwhelming urge to strangle
the living fuck out of someone."   -Mother Therasa

"He's my kind of guy. Best rimjob this side of the Caspian" - Ayatollah Ali
Hoseini-Khamenei

"Now do you see why the internet needs controlling?" -  Chinese President
Jiang Zemin
