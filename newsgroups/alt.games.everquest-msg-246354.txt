Paladins offer various utilities that even if they didn't make main tank,
they could still offer a lot towards beating trial expeditions.
Group heals, fast heals, hp buff, LoH, stuns all count for a lot when even
warriors are getting destroyed in the blink of an eye.

And the top paladins could tank the named mobs required for progression.

They just couldn't accept they aren't tank of choice anymore... thus a
