    If by "start up help" you mean information so that you might have an
idea of what to do and such, then this newsgroup as a whole as already done
something to help you.  All you have to do is click on the FAQ in my sig. 
It's pretty long, but the most up to date, comprehensive everquest FAQ
available, to my knowledge.

  If you mean you want someone to give you stuff/Powerlevel you up, well,
um, you might have along wait on that.
