Yes, your characters will be saved. I don't believe they've ever deleted any
characters ever that weren't level 1s. I could be wrong on that, but you
really don't have to worry about it. Also, you can cancel your account and
keep logging in until the next billing date where it will tell you your
account has expired. So, just keep right on playing until it tells you you
can't anymore. :)
