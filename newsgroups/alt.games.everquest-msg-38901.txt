Nope, there is no way to do this.

What you see are people typing in the auction once
and then using [shift] and the up arrow key to repeat
the auction.

You CAN do multiple line auctions if you put a pause on the
command line but each line will be a separate auction line.
Like this:

/auc WTS blah blah
/pause 10
/auc great item for casters!
/pause 10
/auc blah blah


So the most you could get would be 3 lines in auction.

Note: you have to put a pause in there because the server
will dump chat commands that are sent too quickly to
keep people from spamming too much.
