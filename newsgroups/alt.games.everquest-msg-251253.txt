No problem. I'm willing to listen about advice on gaming.
 
] Never, ever, ever buy equipment off NPC merchants.  Let me put this in

I did find a web page that mentioned 4 'greedy' merchants. I have
noticed, after it was pointed out by that web page ( I usually game
when I'm tired), that they were buying for less and selling higher
than other npc merchants. Goomba the big and the merchant at the
gate of North Qeynos. I forget the other ones off-hand.

My characters are broke at the moment, but I could always go fishing
again... blacksmith rusty to tarnished items to get plat.

Sony should have change the prices then... dynamic market... well,
in another mmorpg I played in.

I might be able to scrounge up, from character bank, 1 maybe 2 plat
at the moment.

Yeah, figures.

I've been thinking about going to Bazaar. I'll see what I can come
up with in plat, traveling and gaming time, etc.
