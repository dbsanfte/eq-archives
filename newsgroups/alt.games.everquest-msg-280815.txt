Your expectations were unreasonable. "I want to be born in new york. You 
want to be born in Cairo. Lets meet meet for some FUN in Paris 10 
minutes from now." Nevermind that we don't have a good map, money, or a 
clue how the world works. Does this seem like a realistic plan?

My circle of friends learned to start in the same place, and scattered 
around once we knew how to get around.

And the root of my response is that you had unreasonable expectations. 
You could have played with a friend, all you had to do was agree to 
start in the same place. Its hardly a total failure of EQ that YOU 
didn't know how to safely circumnavigate the entire freaking world 
within 5 minutes of creating your very first character.

I totally agree. If you want to play in the same place and you don't 
have clue how to get around it should be crystal clear that the best 
thing to do is to start in the same place.

The issue is that you are fixated on the world violating its own 
internal consistency to satisfy your desire to do the one thing you find 
fun... hookup with friends and kill stuff.

Its an unreasonable request. If the world violates its internal 
consistency it ceases to become an immersive world.

I never had that problem. I didn't crisscross the planet every time I 
played. That was the POINT. Being somewhere meant something. It was part 
of the immersion. If you on an adventure in the antartic you don't pop 
off to have lunch in London. People with friends planned their 
expeditions and moved more or less as a group.

Definately Travel in EQ needed *improvement*. They needed to make it 
more interesting and more engaging. They could have done amazing 
things... we'll never know... they simply removed it wholesale instead.

The only obstacles were self imposed. *YOU* decided that the way to have 
FUN was to hookup with friends and hunt with them. There was nothing 
stopping you from logging in and putting a group together with someone 
who was available locally. There was nothing stopping you from 
organizing where you'd meet your friends in advance. There was nothing 
stopping you from smelling the roses along the way from Qeynos to 
Freeport, chatting with NPCs, rescuing people in trouble, taking a stab 
a hill giant...

> getting together to play.

That was a constraint, you imposed on yourself. For what its worth I 
*agree* that features to make it easier to get to groups was a good 
idea; wholesale removal of travel from the game for everyone from level 
onwards was overkill.

But I'm not?

You see, MY idea of fun is take 2 people I'm good friends with and 
together defeat the challenges of everquest. That's where I'm happiest. 
Guess what, it doesn't work. sure there is stuff we can do, but a 3 man 
crew CANNOT defeat most of the interesting challenges of everquest. Most 
of the interesting parts of the game are geared for around 5 or 6, and 
anything truly interesting is tuned for 30+.

Should Anguish be doable by a 3 man crew? Should I be able to do highend 
content with my 3? I'd like to; it would be fun, but I can't. And unlike 
you I can't "waste" an hour getting to the fun part, I have to make a 
big sacrifice, and either set my expectations for accomplishment very 
low, or sign into 30+ member raids to see anything.

Thank god I'm not the majority or whining constantly about it, because 
if SOE "listened" they'd make endgame instances scale to the group that 
went in. So the legitimate raiders could still play the way they always 
have, but I'd be able to take my little 3-man crew and beat the same 
monsters for the same loot. Its all about choice right?

For what its worth I HATE scaling content. Some people think its FUN to 
always have the content tailored to your abilities, 'hard but not too 
hard'... in an mmorpg I prefer fixed challenges that I go from not 
having a hope in hell of touching to eventually being able to mop up in.

Except that in catering to you the game is no longer a world. The rest 
of us lost out, just as catering to me would undermine the game for 
others, or catering to the idgodmode people would ruin the game for 
others. (E.g. if the difficulty scales there is no such thing as raid 
progression... take whatever you want against Mata Muram... don't worry 
he'll just just get toned WAAY down if your still wearing leather armor. 
Wouldn't want you to face a challenge that's impossible to beat... we'll 
make him tough... but rest assured, you -can- take him.)

Pretty much. Although I prefer to think I attributed it to someone who's 
applying your pattern of logic to the issue, not you in particular. I 
really have nothing against you.

Sounds dreadfully un-FUN. You sure you don't want that penalty removed?  
I mean how is it any different than your friends picking up and leaving 
you 2 continents behind? Why is it unreasonable for you to have to pay 
the penalty of catching up with them? 

(You can always hire a porter, its not like you have to walk.) 
(Admittedly for the first few weeks there were no porters, but that was 
a breif anomoly in the player level distribution that would never 
recurr.)

/shrug. 

I have no issue with the implementation of shadowrest. I agree that 
they're should never have been any total loss of corpse. I'd personally 
endorsed the idea of having you respawn 'invisible-invulnerable-
unaggroable until you moved' at the zone-in you orginally entered the 
zone at. Being knocked halfway around the world for tripping over a 
hillgiant was decidely unimmersive to me.

Lucky you. They've turned it into a 3d diablo instead of a game world 
pretty much to suit you.

> Insult me as you feel free (I've just ignored those sections mostly),

Yeah, that really takes all the fun out of it. Still I'm glad you didn't 
take it personally it really wasn't intended as personal despite being 
written to the 2nd person. (ie "you").

The game was never "hard". At best, once upon a time it was "new". 
The game used to be a virtual world. Now its a glorified diablo2. I miss 
the world.

hardly. And orders of magnitude less than it used to be. At least for 
me. I really don't mind that you "have your game". I'd just like to have 
mine too but virtual worlds are in short supply so I'm annoyed that you 
co-opted this one. Lets face it, 'Login and get-right-into-the-action-
with-your-friends' style games are a dime a dozen.

Somebody thinks it would be fun. I know plenty of people who ran around 
in godmode in Doom. So should they add the command? *You* don't have to 
use it. You can play as you always have. Or do you think by simply 
adding the invulnerability mode it will undermine your enjoyment of the 
game EVEN though you aren't personally forced to use it?

I for one would feel completely ripped off and disgusted if they added 
such a command so that people who found it fun to play like that could 
have THEIR FUN.

You see, that's why I "made that up". All the little convenience travel 
features they added for you completely undermined the immersiveness for 
me. It didn't totally ruin the game for me... I still play it after all, 
as much for lack of better alternatives as anything else. But I'm pretty 
annoyed. They made the game more fun for you by making it more like 
EVERY OTHER FRIGGING GAME EVER MADE. Me, I liked, EQ the virtual world. 
There aren't a lot of substitutes out there...

We agree again. I never thought travel was particularly well done in EQ 
either. But whereas you wanted (and got) it effectively REMOVED, I 
simply wanted it IMPROVED.
