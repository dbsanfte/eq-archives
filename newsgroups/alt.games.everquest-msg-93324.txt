No sir.  He wanders into the Iksar Master after about 2 hours, and
apparently Mr. Rinmark doesn't care too much for nasty looking fish and
proceeds to make fish sticks out of Mr. Ugly.

He's really just too hard to bother with under most circumstances due to
this, especially now that the pod of water for the druid epic can be gotten
off the spawned version (who appears in the hidden inn area, where there
will be a raid force assembled to kill him, or die trying)

Although he does drop the meat for Othmir Prexus Totem quest, either pally
book and Dragon Hero bracer from the "real" spawn.   All of which are
obtainable from other sources (Kelorek'dar; Vox/Gore for frost or
Naggy/Talendor/Ragefire for burnt; Sev/Talendor/Gore)

IMO, the real threat to him is accidentally popping up on one of the Raptor
isles, they will eat him so fast he won't know what hit him, and they have
an immensely large agro radius.
