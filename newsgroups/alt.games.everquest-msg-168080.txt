I don't think you have any idea just how "many other things" are
involved here.

rofl.  So you're gonna hold up all patches/updates for <months> of
testing?

Go ahead, work that out as a proof.  Then, if you aren't convinced
yet, add in 5 soloers and groups of 2, 4, 3, 3, 5, 2, 3, 5, and 4.

Nope, my "basic argument" is that you are glossing over an exceedingly
complex problem without any indication that you have grasped the
complexity.  I am reminded of my own belief, at age 12, that it should
be a simple matter to write a computer chess program (in BASIC no less).

Me too, but your suggestion isn't gonna come close.  Take some time
and really think about it.  Work out a moderately complex example.
Then spend even more time finding ways it could be "exploited" or
"broken" by players who cared nothing for the spirit of your rules,
but only about winning (and remember that griefers have a different
definition of winning).  The simple mechanical model you described
cannot cope with the complexity that players would create.  If you
do succeed in coming up with a solid system I'd love to hear about
it.
