Bummer that happened!
But- consider @lvl7 you get a no exp loss death- and @lvl10 he does.
The guy might have died a few times already transitioning from
easy-painless deaths to exp. loss deaths...

I don't know...usually when I group (esp. at low levels)- if one
person goes down, I'm usually right behind as I don't dig abandoning
people.  People tend to remember and are appreciative of that fact...
you make friends fast that way.

Good luck :)
