Yes,waste of time,I rarely die more then once in 18 hours,Divine res
brings me up with 100% mana and no res effects.Plenty of mana
to res others and even cast a MGB Virtue or Symbol.
And I like my Chardok faction too,Chardok B being the only place
where I can solo dark blue mobs with reasonable loot(research drops).
