I have 3 computers sharing a cable router.  Oddly enough, one of them is
inclined to disconnect after suffering what you describe.  The EQ folder is
identical to my working computer (I copied it over, after all...and both
have a GF2 card in it) so I'm kinda clueless.  After starting the game again
it's usually fine.

No, adding more RAM won't solve the problem.  Despite my odd issues I'm more
inclined to blame your ISP, especially if you're using AOL as your email
address suggests.
