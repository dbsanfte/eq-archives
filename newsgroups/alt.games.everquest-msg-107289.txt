Doesn't Quillmane drop a cloak that is a pretty decent item for many folks?
There is also the possibility of selling MQ rights to a mage.  Regardless,
KSing someone is just wrong.  MF should have petitioned and reported, and
gotten the drop taken away from the KSer.  Condoning that type of act
regardless of why the person did it is just plain wrong.  From the
description of the story, it sounded like there was little doubt that the KS
was intentional, why else would the KSer have even bothered talking to them?
The cloak is of possible use to MF as a free unlimited, reagentless levitate
spell, possibly an upgrade in AC, or as a sellable MQ to a mage for their
epic.  Regardless of any of that, to KS it is wrong.  MF might have allowed
said person to loot it, if asked politely, who knows, he was not given the
chance to make the choice.
