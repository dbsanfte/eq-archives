You obviously have never played an Enchanter or Bard. That "one less
thing" you mentioned is the *ONLY* thing they are "considered" good
for below the mid-30s (when most players actually learn about true
crowd control, and realize how good the two classes really are). I
never said mana-regen was the only thing they offered to a group. I
know the strengths of the two classes...most players don't.
*ESPECIALLY* the ones that level-up in outdoor zones (or PC) where
crowd control is a non-issue.

So basically in a 45-55 zone you could not have pulled off what you
did without KEI. Now think about how much KEI would do for you in a
group at levels 20-30....

I said "ruining" not ruined. I should have said "hurting". It would
have been more accurate.

On a character below level 30 KEI is godly, and has completed skewed
grouping. People now shout out "Level XXX LFG (Have KEI)" and are
picked up over those without it. Classes that are considerred weak
soloers can solo with KEI making it harder for non-casting classes to
find groups.
