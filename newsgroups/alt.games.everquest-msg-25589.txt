I can't imagine why you don't have solid friends?  I get free ports from
strangers all the time, why?? well because I ask nicely,  "/shout
Looking for a SoW to get to point XXX,  Sorry to take your time,  I can
only offer my gratitude as I'm on a Corpse recovery.  This message will
not repeat, thank you for reading it."

Because 10 minutes of their time=50pp, therefore 10 minutes of their
time=50pp.

learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
