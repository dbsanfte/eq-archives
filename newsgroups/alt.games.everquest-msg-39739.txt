Casters Realm have this to say on it:

Q:      Does agility affect running speed? I've noticed people with a 
        agi of 96 tend to out distance me my agi is 90.

A:      You must be seeing things, or perhaps over burdened. The only 
        thing which affects your running speed is your weight and any 
        movement haste or slow spells which are in effect on you.
