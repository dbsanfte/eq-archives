Anybody can tag a pull, but only with two FD classes can you double tag, where
FD one stirs up the hornet's nest and pulls it off one way, and then the second
FD puller gets some of those  and pulls them a different direction, before your
real tagger pulls just one out of that mini swarm.  Or the two FD pullers can
alternate back and forth till they get the mob or mobs they wanted.

As a cleric, I happily took monk over any other tank up into the low 50s, since
their high damage mitigation meant that healing them was cheap.  Once we got up
to where CHeals were the heal of choice even for monks this stopped making so
much sense, I was the same amount of mana healing monks as healing warriors...
except that I'd still prefer a monk since his DPS was higher so the mob would
die quicker, meaning less heal cycles.

Here's how it looked from a healer's standpoint.  Warrior HP bar on mob X would
drop 50% per 30 seconds.  Monk HP bar on mob X would also drop 50% per 30
seconds.  Yes, the warrior's total HP was twice that of the monk's, but the
monk was taking half the damage, so it looked the same.  Now I apply a 500
point heal.  Warrior's HP bar goes up by 20%, monk HP bar goes up by 40%.
Clearly the monk was the better tank!

Post nerf, of course, the monk's HP bar would drop 100% in the time it took the
warrior's to drop 50%.  And a rez and rebuff is a lot more mana cost than just
a CHeal.
