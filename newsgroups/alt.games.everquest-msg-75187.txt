I dont see what the real big deal is here?
I am no xpert but it seems that every little nuence of this game is
"exploited" .....?
Not complaining thats just how/what it is.

In this case You just dont have to be a Veteran to be able to do or know
about the xploit.....Seems anyone can take advantage....(which is not always
the case i have found)

Now I have never particapated in a gaurd killing (though i have hit them by
accident and died) but what is the difference here ?
..... one persons gain is maybe *anothers*  loss.

I just dont see the differnce of killing a SB,  and the killing of the gaurd
by the Toll Booth in the Commons?   ...that gaurd may be there to benenfit a
low level by protection but it seems more than not that he is there to
bennifit others from giving xp......hummm

Now I know this is probably a slanted view of things after reading the other
posts but i feel the questions are:
1. wow what is the SB respawn time because i am gonna get that 2hb(that i
have neglected) up real fast.....Woot !
2. What faction (if any) does this change?
3. I sure know where i am coming for my next hell level

Now all that said i am sure that i will never try to attempt killing a SB
(cause i believe in good Carma)  but it sure sounds awfully tempting  :)

ohhh well I had to say that   :)
