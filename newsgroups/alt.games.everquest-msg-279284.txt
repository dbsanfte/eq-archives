I was going to list them all, but then decided I'd been enough of a
smartass :)

Yeah, the whole "monster" thing... sounds like they're trying to add in
some "DungeonKeeper" elements to try and keep things fresh for the
casual gamer.  But I see this easily backfiring even worse than PoK
portals. Really, mechanics-wise, how is allowing you to play as an orc
any different from playing as a froglok, troll, or iksar?

Truly one of the greatest shows of all time.

Now here's an idea (may have already been mentioned/thought of) that
might work to keep things more interesting: some vandal/vandals go
about destroying all the PoK books, except for some of the more remote
ones (Thurgadin, Firiona Vie, perhaps Shar Vahl, etc).  New
Norrath-side PoK portals are put in to replace them, but in more remote
and better protected locations.  People in PoK while this is all going
down can take portals to their original destination cities, but not
back into PoK.  Suddenly, the World of Norrath becomes huge and epic to
traverse again.  To make things more fun, people can work to
defend/destroy the portals, depending on their allegiences (I see the
Iksar as highly motivated to destroy all PoK portals, for example)

I'd rather that than "now play as an NPC model/archetype for an
unspecified time period! Fight against PC models and archtypes being
controlled by our crappy AI!" That has a great deal of potential for
abuse and to just get plain old, with very little nifty factor.

I mean, if I want to play DungeonKeeper, I'll go play DungeonKeeper. Or
maybe "Wizardry V: Heart of the Maelstrom" (? The one where you get to
play as Werdna).  I don't play EverQuest for that sort of fix, I play
it for my total immersion RP fix that's not handing levels out like
candy (maybe out like burgers at a company picnic - back in line, you!)
