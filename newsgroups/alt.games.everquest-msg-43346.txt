Well, one thing you DEFINATELY won't like:

In daoc you can't cast spells while engaged, as in you can't when a
thing is beating on you.. at all. Its not a case of being interrupted,
you simply can't.. not at all. I was playing a viking girl type healer
character with a 2 hand hammer and beating on stuff but I could only
heal after the fight was over. Of course if grouped with a tank I
could stop attacking and if the tank was getting hit I could heal the
tank but if something was hitting me I could not, not at all. 

In some ways I kind of like that since although I can't heal during
the fight mana goes back up to full EXTREMELY fast, so I cast a couple
heals after a fight then by the time the next fight is over I'm FM
again.

I can't see how this would work really for straight caster types,
you'd have to essentially nuke something to death before it got close
to you or nuke first then finish with melee. I think this makes it
much more of a group type game.
