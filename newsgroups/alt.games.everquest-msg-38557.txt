Hello everyone,

I play Fudor on the Xegony server.

I haven't played for quite some time now, and have upgraded my system to
win2000.  I have installed every win2000 patch available.

When I try to start everquest, I go through the normal upgrade process, but
when I press play online, I immediately get the following message.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
eqgame.exe

The exception priveledged instruction.
(0xc0000096) occured in the application at location 0x01098002

Click ok to terminate
Click cancel to debug
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Have any of you had a similar problem?  How did you solve it?

Thanks,
Russ
