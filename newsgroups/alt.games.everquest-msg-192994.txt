IMHO, the Oasis route is safer, if you have SoW or are on constant watch.
(I've gone to Oasis to turn in Lightstones several times as one of my alts,
WITHOUT SoW, and made it there and back out without being attacked at all,
but I've also had occasions where I've ended up training something to zone
when leaving or been attacked while handing the Lightstones in)

You can reasonably run from a mob and zone safely if a mob is on you, unless
its a Ghoul and it roots you, or its an SG. And unless it spawns right on
top of you, you should be able to hear an SG coming in plenty of time to get
out of its way. (Drybones and some Desert Madmen will cast, though, so
you'll still take some hits anyway if one is on you)

True, you could run past the wizzy spires and across the bridge to SK, but
there are more mobs (Hill Giants and Griffins, mostly) that will aggro on
you in NK are more likely to kill you before you can even reach the bridge
than mobs in Oasis that will kill you before you zone.

If you go the Oasis route, getting fire and cold resist buffs might also be
a good idea (fire, especially).

Plus, if you take the port to NK from the Nexus, you're going to have to
wait around 15 minutes or so for the portal to reactivate, and mobs DO
attack people at the spires. I don't recommend doing this unless you can
cast Camo, Invisibilty or Gather Shadows on yourself and\or have a decent
Hide ability.
