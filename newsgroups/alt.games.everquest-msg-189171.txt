If you have chosen to dismiss my arguments as stubbornness, that's your 
prerogative, but it's not true. I'm more than willing to admit to be 
wrong if weapons of mass destruction are actually found, and if the US 
honors the extant oil agreements Iraq has acquired.

While I have no axe to grind with the US at all (quite the opposite, in 
fact... I certainly hope no INS or DHS officials are reading this thread 
and putting me in an immigration blacklist), I have no national pride to 
make me dismiss the "oil grab" explanation out of hand either, and so 
far it appears to me to be the one that best fits all the facts 
concerning both Iraq and North Korea.

As for the UN, rest assured that I'm not missing any of your points, nor 
denying them. Where we seem to disagree is to the motivation for taking 
action at this point. You seem to believe it's out of concern for the 
security of Israel (which has proven capable of defending itself so far, 
and *has* got its own weapons of mass destruction), and I believe that 
to be not so much a reason, but an excuse.

Anyway, I'm glad we have managed to keep this conversation civil so far. 
You are welcome to have the last word.
