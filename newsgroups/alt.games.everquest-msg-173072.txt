Check your cast time again in game with a stop watch, its more like 4
seconds now. Dont know exactly when it changed but it did. Shocked the
heck outa some of us but it isnt 3 seconds any longer. Noticed it when
doing 5 twists then confirmed it on 4. On a 3 sec cast getting 4
twists was easy (good connection) and 5 doable. Now barely can get 4
in and many times cant.
