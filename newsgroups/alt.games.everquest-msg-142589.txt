Maybe on the raids you do...

Im always with a cleric.  if theres no spare clerics, I'll take my own.  If
im not getting exp, I know for fact that the guy who is getting exp has got
a cleric in group (his 24/7 cleric bot)

The ONLY group I know who is happy having no cleric, is our 5 man wizard
team who group with a druid

I've had my cleric and shaman bots in my group in the past, and still been
getting exp.
