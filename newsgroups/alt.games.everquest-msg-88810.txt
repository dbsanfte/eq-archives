Aye, in EverFrost on Tunare Server there was an event much similar to the
one in WC, it had werewolves as the main monster, along with some other
undead things and a witch as the main bad person. I didnt get to really see
any of it.

Honestly I think VI is taking it way to easy with quests, its all preset
events they made up, dont even care enough to put a real GM on. And its the
same repetitive quest.
