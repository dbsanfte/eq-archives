Well, sort of. You have to gain level 5 or 6 (I forget) to get off the Isle 
of Refuge where everyone starts, but this is akin to getting level 3 or 4 in 
EQLive, since you essentially start off at level 3 after the tutorial. 
Shouldn't take more than a couple of hours' time, I think, to hit that. Once 
you're off the Isle and in town there is no adventuring ever required again. 
You can sit in a tradeskill instance and craft exclusively. I don't see many 
players do that because adventuring is fun and a nice change of pace, but if 
you wanted to I don't see any reason you couldn't.
