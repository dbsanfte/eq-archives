While I sort of agree with you, definitely agree if you're talking
about hardcore gamers, I think the main complaint that is spurring on
Bitch-fest 2001 here on a.g.e is the fact that people feel like they
are being FORCED to upgrade to play a game that they have already been
playing for a while now.  This is not true, but there you go.

I can see how a truly casual gamer, a beast I don't think one ever
actually sees on EverCrack, I can see having this dropped on you can
be a bit disconcerting.

But they have never, to my knowledge, had to do such a drastic upgrade
for just an expansion pack.  But then again, FPS games usually don't
have a lifespan of three years.  New versions come out every 1.5 to 2
years.  Unless of course we're talking about Valve Software and Half
Life.

Pretty much agree here except with the harddrive and OS.

I was running on a 10gig harddrive up until about six or seven months
ago.  You have no idea how minuscule that seems after you've gotten
much more than two good size apps on it.  Ah for the days when you
install an OS on less than a 100mb drive.

And as for the OS, if you're a hardcore gamer, I wouldn't go any
higher than WinME.  Win2K can handle games, but it really isn't it's
forte, and XP is still too new for me to trust.
