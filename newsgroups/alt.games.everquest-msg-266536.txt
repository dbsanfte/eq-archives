   Poisoning people is bad, Mm'kay?

   Yes, in most cases the victim will not die.  But it is possible for that
to happen, and I don't want to accidentally become a murderer.   This
business of my trying to induce food poisoning in someone simply is _not_
going to happen, ever, under any circumstances.

   After reading through this thread and thinking it through, I'm leaning
heavily to visiting the "backing" department of my local megamart and
scoring some alum.  I seem to remember it as being a white powder, so it
should be easy to either mix in strait to something like mashed potatoes,
or mix with a bit of water pour over noodles.  The plus side here is that I
don't think the thief will be able to tell it is there until the get a
mouthful of the stuff.  

   The idea of using the gel dyes that links have been provided for is
very, very appealing to me as well.  But I think that there is more of a
chance for a "Hey, what the heck is this?" moment that will foil the whole
thing.  I'm also thinking that I might have to do more than one application
of lunchroom justice to truly dissuade the guilty, so maybe the dye idea
will still come into play.

   Thanks for the great ideas, everyone.  I knew you'd come through for me.
