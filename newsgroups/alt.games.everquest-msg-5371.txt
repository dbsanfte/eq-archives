Okay, I'm filled with questions today as I've been playing some alts the
last month or so.  I have a rogue who just reached level 16.  I'm wondering
on how exactly backstab works and what would be the best weapons and stats
to invest in.  Currently I've been using my newly bought serrated bone dirk
and in my off-hand a walrus tooth.  I also have a stilletto of the bloodclaw
that I'm debating on using in my secondary instead of the walrus tooth.  I'm
a halfling and currently my str is 94, agility is 115, and dex is 105.  I
think my stamina is 98, but I can't remember.  I've noticed my backstab
damage goes up with higher strength and higher weapon damage in my main
hand.  How does backstab skill level and my level affect the damage output?
Any suggestions on affordable weapons that would be better than what I'm
currently using?   Thanks.

Menarion
