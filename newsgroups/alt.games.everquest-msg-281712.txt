So, I've got some plat finally and want to see about a horse (or drog
or whatever).

Question is, what am I looking for?  Where am I looking for it?

I know very little about mounts.  Can I melee while on one?  If so, do
I still get sitting benefits (health and mana) while doing so?  Speed
and responsiveness of differing mount types?

Someone I grouped with one time mentioned spending a grip of cache on
bard speed, but the toon was a shaman.  The comment was made regarding
mounts.  Is there a mount that moves at bard speed (besides the knight
mounts)?

If someone has a link for information like the above I would
appreciate it.

Thanks.

google?".
