Hmmm, I leveled up in DL and have a very good reputation and am quite
sought after to do dungeon raids. Soloers tend to be the ones who lack
experience and do poorly in dungeons in my experience. And loot? Well
items wise DL doesnt have much but most mobs drop about five plat, you
should be taking at least 100pp a session there. But I have to agree,
Rathe Mountains is probably a good place for you.
