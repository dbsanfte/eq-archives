Crushbone scalps can be given to Captain Ashlan who is now usually on or
around the fortification near the Deathfist Orcs. He starts on the west
side, moves to the east side, then moves down to the path and gradually
gets creamed after a few orcs. then respawns about 15 (?) minutes later
(estimate, not timed).

I am currently getting 5gp+ per CB Orc scalps from him for my wood elf
ranger. This can be a handy source of plat for anyone with a newb
character in Kelethin/GF. Allocate one box in a bank slot to collect orc
scalps as you come across them whilst levelling. Then when you wander
through HighPass, you can cash the box load in for 100pp.


I have not been able to find anyone who talks Deathfist PAWN scalps.
Allakhazam only lists them for a newbie armour quest. Hazran, Ashlan and
Commander Thafer do not want them.
