Stamina. This is true for all classes, but rogues are rather
stat-independent on most things. Your job is to dish damage more than
anything else. Strength gives a small boost to maximum hit, but often
takes care of itself with equiptment upgrades.

A good haste item is essential for a rogue. Silver Chitin Handwraps,
at the least, would be critical. For most other pieces, I'd look for
Mrylokar's. Most pieces can be had for 1-3k now. Also, I'd look out
for Chetari Bonecrafted Shield (back,) Barbed Ringmail (chest,) Idol
of the Thorned (range,) and a good old hero bracer (wrist.)
