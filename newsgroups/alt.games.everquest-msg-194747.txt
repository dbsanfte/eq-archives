Yes you did, you missed the Ranger. Ultimately *the* best class in the game
if you like going solo :), although I've only ever played a Ranger, Wizard,
Magician, Shaman and Warrior.

With a Ranger you have the best tracking in the game, so you can always find
what you are looking for to hunt or to quest. You can SoW yourself, hide,
sneak, go invisible, snare, root, DoT and have great archery and weapon
skills. The downside in a group is you will take a lot of damage tanking,
and will be called a mana sponge by the cleric. But on the whole, a very
versatile character that I don't get bored with.
