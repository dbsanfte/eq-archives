If I read him right, he was talking about the mobs, not the developers. 
It *is* nice to see that mobs are being given some AI to discern that 
they are having no effect whatsoever... its only logical that they'll 
pick a new target... its what you would do isn't it.

Its the evolution of the game, and for once its in the right direction.

Sure players are going to need new tools to deal with smarter mobs, but 
bitching about how much better it would be if the mobs got dumb again is 
just stupid.
