    The wand, Staff, and Stave are items that you rarely if ever see up for
auction (people that have them keep them), and which are rare drops if
camped. I'd guess it would be easier to get a PoG/Thurg/Kael/SS WIZ robe, or
those bard boots from Cazic Thule, than those items. Or you could settle for
a Ball of Velium from Velk's - those always seem to drop when nobody wants
one!

    Heh - there's how many Starfire BPs in the game across all servers?
"Hard" is putting it mildly. The Rend Robe is the most useful right-click
damage item in game right now, pretty much - and it's easy to get if you
have a VP crew with a few Manaburners.
