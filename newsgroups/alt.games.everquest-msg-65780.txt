    It was hard to tell - there could be (and frequently would be) 100 folks
in the zone, but how many were hunting actively?

>Sol B 5-6?

    Again, tough to say. Pool, King et. al., Noble/Circle. Bats, Nox, Stone
Spider. That would be six without anyone mounting a raid / getting a solid
group together to do Efreeti.

    If Vox was down, they could attempt to get into the Pit and set up
there. It would certainly be a "you must know what you're doing" situation,
but not impossible.

    Oh - add specs in Oasis to the list of things to hunt. 8) Not to 50, but
to darn close to 50.

    Agreed there. The things that weren't being hunted were quite difficult
for the gear of the day, and once people hit 50 there was nothing to do
except farm stuff waiting for the expansion.
