Since I've been saying that a Troll Shaman with tons of Stamina is
clearly going to have a lot more HP than a Wood Elf Ranger with his bonus
points in Str and Dex and Wis,  I think that comparing the HP of a troll
shaman to a wood elf ranger to be far more appropriate than ogre warrior
to wood elf warrior.

Further, since I've been saying "at low levels" I think level one is far
more appropriate for comparison than level 65.

Still further, since I've been saying that concentrating on STA alone,
compared to other people spreading their starting points around into
various useful stats, I think it best explored my point to put all the
Shaman's points into STA and none of the ranger's points into STA, thus
giving the largest possible disparity.

Now the fact that my experiment utterly disproved my theory in no way
invalidates the experiment.  In fact, an experiment that disproves a
hypothesis is in many ways the -best- experiment!

I suspect though that melee may recieve some sort of bonus that has more
effect at extremely low levels than stamina, so that perhaps at 5 or 10
or 15 the shaman will have more HP... I don't  have a way to experiment
with this as I can't do Magelo and don't care quite enough to actually
-run- my newbie shaman and ranger duo's up to 20 each.

Admittedly your method would be interesting for comparing the effect of
stamina and race on HP at high levels, by having both characters be
warriors.  Better would be to use two ogre warriors, one with high sta
and one with low sta.  Then a wood elf warrior and an ogre warrior both
with the same sta.  Then an ogre shaman and an ogre warrior with the same
stamina.  Isolate just the one variable you want to explore.

Kind of makes me wish I could get Magelo to work.
