Yes, should have made it clearer I guess

You have easy access to Luclin and as such, the Bazaar with the PoK portals.
Without these, any race except Wood Elves (and maybe Erudites) are going to
have a rough time (or a long wait) getting to a set of Spires.
Few people tout ports in newbie zones, there is little money to be made
there.
