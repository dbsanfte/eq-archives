LOL Yeah, me too. It's not nearly as nice a thing to have as the Rod of
Insidious Glamour. I guess it could be useful if you were in one of
those chain stunning situations; you never know, you might get lucky on
the proc and if you're gonna be in melee range anyway, you might as well
be whacking on the mob with a stick I suppose. Mine sat in the bank
forever. I finally ended up giving it to a lowbie chanter I met; I
figured he was still meleeing so he might actually get some use from it.
