RvR is done only in the Frontiers or the "Battlegrounds".  Battlegrounds are
level limited areas that serve as "training grounds" for endgame RvR.  They
are basically circular zones with a keep in the center and individual realm
Keeps at 3 points (Guarded by level 80, or something insane, border guards
to keep people out of opposing realms).  The realms contend for ownership of
the central keep using siege engines, squads and armies.  I have been part
of some truly epic realm battles in the battle grounds.

The Frontiers however are a different matter.  They recently completely
reworked the layout of the Frontiers and how they work, so a good bit of my
data is dated, but the basics will not have changed much.

RvR revolves around Relics.  Each realm has 2, one magic based the other
melee based.  They add bonuses to the realms power in its base.  The idea is
to steal enemy's relics, get them to your relic keep and defend them.  Each
relic adds more to that damage type for the entire realm, in RvR or PvE.

Stealth can be amazing.  The Stealth wars can be deadly and brutal.  Stealth
classes include the Assassins: Infiltrator(Alb), Nightshade(Hib), and
Shadowblade(Mid), and the Archers: Hunter(Mid), Scout(Alb), and Ranger(Hib)
as well as the Minstrel from Albion.  Learn about this before you go into
any RvR, there are few defenses against them, but they are not the be all
and end all of RvR, but truly devastating if well used.

As a Paladin, and a two hand weapon user, I was not overly welcome in RvR,
nor did I enjoy it over much (that was mostly just me though).  As Ben
pointed out Mez can be a fun killer, and Albion had the short end of the
stick on that skill, but it is not truly the be all and end all of RvR.

The new Frontiers have completely reworked the terrain, making choke points,
and one way areas (as in, "No you really cannot climb up that cliff to get
out of the river, you will have to swim to the lower banks" type thing,
which one used to be able to do).  They have also added towers to each keep,
and taking the towers is a necessity to prevent the enemy from "porting"
into the keep for defense.  They have made it possible to break down keep
walls rather than just coming in through the gates (Old way was to break
down 2 gates with rams or melee, and you where in).  I have considered
popping back in just to see what is new and fun with the New Frontiers, but
have not done so.

Personally, I loved it.  As for the PvE being boring and predictable, on
that count I would have to disagree.  In EQ, if I have a mob I can beat in
melee, I can hit auto attack, and pick up a book.  In DAoC, as I train up my
weapon skill, I receive new weapons "styles" each with a different effect,
possibly a Stun, or Snare and a different combat prerequisite, as in I must
Parry my attacker to use this style, and possibly its follow up as well.
So, in combat I HAD to pay close attention to what was going on.  Before
they reworked the 2 Hand styles, I was able to stun my opponent for 3
seconds, which allowed me the time to strafe to his flank and use my Flank
style, whose follow up also had a stun effect, giving me the time once
again, to strafe and use the Flank style.  If I did not both time the strafe
right and hit the right hot key for the proper style, I did not get this
opportunity.  This would give me the opportunity to kill higher level mobs
if I worked the styles carefully.  Being a Paladin, I also had Chants,
different magical effects usable in combat, but only one could be "up" at a
time.  If I was good at what I was doing, I could twist my chants (much like
an EQ Bard twists songs) AND use my styles to devastating effect.  AND, the
weapon type, Thrust, Slash, Crush, would determine how much damage you would
do against certain mobs.  As an example, fleshy undead, say a zombie, would
take much more damage from a slashing weapon than a crushing weapon.  So,
choosing your opponent could be very important.  This Weapon type to armor
type damage thing carried over into RvR as well.  There are charts out there
indicating which armor types are weak to which damage type (Each realm has
all three types of weapons by different names).  Albion, however are the
only plate mail wearers, Paladins and Armsmen.  While their armor had a
higher absorb rate, they did not get the Evade skill that the other main
tanks got.

I could go on and on...

I left, because myself and my friends simply did not enjoy it any more.
Trials of Atlantis, while adding some amazing areas and fun PvE stuff, the
Artifacts, and Master Levels were a bit beyond me, since I rarely had the
opportunity to spend multiple hours on a raid (EQ will be the same for me,
but my friends are here).  Much of the PvE areas they added I was unable to
reach without many friends.  And, as I said, RvR was rarely my favorite
place.

Helps?
