We necromancers don't study blasphemous tomes full of sanity warping
text for nothing.  Why else do we like to play with the dead, heheheh,
and yes my Necromancer is an erudite.  The faction may be something
related to being an erudite, but as an evil class, I shouldn't be able
to sell in Oasis with the gypsies etc.  My characters who all killed
dervs were apprehensive or worse, IIRC my Necro is indifferent.  I
followed the advice of a fellow erudite necro who told me that dervs
affect gypsy faction, not sure where his info came from but it's seemed
to hold true for my necro.  YMMV of course.
