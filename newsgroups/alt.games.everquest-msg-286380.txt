System coming down at 5am PDT, estimated downtime 6 hours.

The updates page says 	
	
	The next Game Update is tentatively planned for Wednesday, July 25, 
2007.  Details will be made available as we get closer to the date.

so thats interesting.

I'm guessing they're trying to fix the pathing issues for pets, and the 
way mobs can now be pushed or otherwise path right thru walls, and the 
way bodies often end up unlootable, dropped thru a hillside onto the 
floor.

Guessing might not be the word, how about hoping.  Say, for instance, 
that they aren't hard at work trying to stop my AA from affecting my 
lifetap procs, as they suggested was happening last patch.
