www.eqdruids.com has a good hunting forum.

I'm trying to remember what the heck I did at 31.  I think I started the
multiple pulls around then.  Lake of Ill Omen you can pull 2 goblin warlords
to start, snare, run in a circle until they are on top of each other than
blast away with lightning.  This will work better at 34 and you can pull up
to four.  It's pretty cool dropping 4 at once and it's mad exp.  Just rinse
and repeat.

For grouping OT (OVerThere) is the best place at that level.

If you happen to be on the Drinal server, I'll help you with some items.
