Totemic armor used banded as part of the quest.  Some of the pieces were 
such a royal pain to get the drops for, at least at a level where the 
Totemic would be worthwhile, that it was not worth the effort.  I did do 
a few of the pieces, and even wore the helm into my 50s, until I got a 
Thurgadin quest helm, however, that helm was given to me, I did not 
finish the quest for it.
