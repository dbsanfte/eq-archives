Exactly, meaning any 3 groups can kill him. As you indicated there are
probably lots of green scales out there not being put to use heh

As for the epics, I've seriously considered destroying the mainhand epic
and Scabard after I've made a second 2hander. Losing 6 bank slots is a
real pain, but I'll prolly keep it just in case heh. Hell, I still can
bear to destroy my monsoon, though my Grim pauldrons and a few pieces of
Indic went in the bin last week ):oP

Woushi doesn't drop green scales btw, he drops emerald scales for the
Emerald Dragonscale BP Quest and I don't think they're interchangeable
