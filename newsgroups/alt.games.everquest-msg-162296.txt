You, as in your cat character cannot do this.  No way, no how.  Now if you,
the player, make 4 alts, one in each cat class, and level them up a bit and do
their cat quests and skill up in their class chosen trade skills, then you,
the player, can do this quest.  Or if your cat manages to find cat friends who
didn't skip the quests or are willing to start them now, then the group of you
can do this quest.

But alone, I really don't see how one cat can do it.

And as I said before, I've never met anyone who did do it.

Llyric, 41 bard with quests done up to this stage, Morell Thule (if you want
to transfer servers, then you'll have at least one other part potentially
made)

ps the bard quests yeild very nice bard instruments unless you are heavily
twinked.
