Just remember that "discretion is the better part of valor".  Don't
let all the doom and gloom from the other posters scare you off.
Back long before PoP or even SoL (i.e. before FV became a ghost
town) I had several characters based out of FV who ran from there
to LOIO (and back) routinely without ever having the benefit of an
Invis and occasionally without SoW.  The drachs can be avoided, all
it takes is patience and attention to where they are and where
they're going.  Points to remember:
1) the drachs are Rangers, those that are L30+ can and sometimes do
cast See Invis on themselves.  This means that if you are relying
on Invis/Camo to get past them you have to con them before getting
close (indifferent means they don't see you).

2) if you're following the wal from the book to the LOIO zone you

may occasionally see drachs very close to the wall, if they con
as KOS wait for them to move away before passing by them.

I've never had a Druid or Ranger of any level killed travelling thru
FV, in fact my only death travelling was a Warrior who put too much
faith in his SoW on the way back from LOIO and succumbed to DoTs on
the bridge because he didn't detour wide enough around a group of
drachs.  That same Warrior made the trip at least a dozen times
without the benefit of SoW, just takes more caution.
