Or make the current epics soloable and the new uber epics of uberness
require raid forces. Instanced encounters to prevent stupid multi questing
and competition for the same mobs. I think the current monk epic should be a
series of fights between monks where you defeat the monk of higher order at
your guild, for example. I acknowledge that the original epic holders went
through hell, but lets move on and make epics accessible to soloers and
casual players who can't call on the resources of a guild or sit in a
dungeon for 12 hours continuously.

Climbing a mountain solo is a lot harder than with a group, and a single
group struggles more than with a backup team looking after them, but it's
always an achievement. Soloing an epic would be the same; easiest for those
with backups (eg buffed and damage shielded etc, maybe even with borrowed
droppable planar gear, although perhaps the later fights would start with
all buffs being stripped).

Maybe the epic could be accompanied with screenshots, an animation, and your
name appearing on the walls of PoK. That would be lovely :-)

There was a fight in the Thomas Covenant books between monks for the
position of the guardian (memory now hazy, it was a decade ago that I read
it.) No matter how well he fought, he couldn't beat the current guardian,
until he realised he had to sacrifice himself as well. In dying, he was
transformed. That fight was epic, to my mind... can you imagine if a warrior
had to fight solo a horde of green mobs, and simply kill enough of the
bastards before he died to save his city from invasion to be victorious?

Simply fighting that battle, even if you lost, would be glorious. You could
have the mobs swarming into the city upon the warriors death, laying waste
to anyone who didn't hear the warnings of armies approaching. Cities like
freeport are ghost towns now, but wouldn't it be fun to see how much of a
defense you could organise if you knew someone was fighting their epic and
weren't certain they would make it? Sure, the swarm might be green, and drop
little loot, but a faction hit with all the inhabitants of a city would be
sweet, and perhaps with sufficient faction you could get a medal and be
declared a town hero ( no-drop medal, charm, stats depend on number of horde
killed???)

A side thought; maybe necromancers would simply murder their guild masters
to "start a new guild" as part of their epic. It's evil, and seems to fit
into the lore of necros being 'anti-social'. Shadow knights or paladins
could fight in honorable combat against their opposite number.

The rogue epic seems pretty much right except for the bit about dark elves
in kithicor... those dark elves and the fog make the zone empty, because
even paladins and clerics don't want to fight effectively blind against mobs
that start going blue in the 30's but which have level 50+ friends. To my
mind kithicor forest needs to be revamped so that it's more player friendly;
simply kill the fog and make epic mobs sit in a corner rather than near
centre would help.
