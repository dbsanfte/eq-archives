And it's a heck of a lot of fun if you're of the explorer bent.
Exploring a dungeon like cazic thule or lower guk without a map is
probably the most fun I ever had in EQ. Running around the various zones
as a bard back in Mar 99 when there was no one at the Aviak village, or
in Lake Rathe or the Rathe mountains was also great fun.

Brad said at least once, back when he used to visit this newsgroup, that
they had hoped players would get the information from each other. A
totally naive view with the 20/20 hindsight we have now, but it was
quite true in the beginning. My bard used to get a lot of tells from
younger bards asking what songs did, as I was one of the 2 or 3 highest
on the server at the time. I'm still a bit embarresed that I didn't
realize what Bewitching Bravura did for 2 or 3 levels, when I finally
realized it was a charm song.
