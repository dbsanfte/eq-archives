Maybe the invis suggestion is to get up to indifferent faction when
you're not KOS but you still have worse faction than you need to hand
the stuff in. Suppose the guy accepts scalps at apprehensive but not at
dubious, maybe you could invis (so you're indifferent), hand the guy the
stuff (you've now dropped invis), then have someone cast invis on you
again *before* you click the 'give' button (so you are indifferent again
when you make the trade) - I've heard that is supposed to work although
I've not tried it...
