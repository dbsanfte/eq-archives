A lot of largely true stuff.

One thing, though: Porters do go to the Tox, because of the Hole.  Catching

a ride is hardly impossible, especially for those of us playing alt
characters,
a growing population, as the game attracts fewer new players, but is still
interesting for those of us with one high level character and curiousity
about playing other classes up for one reason or another.

Also, the very lowest level ports seem to include Tox, can't porters
take you there at 29?  29 porters work the taxi business, and they
do it relatively cheaply, 5 or 10 pp should suffice to get you from
say WC to the Tox relatively quickly.

Second, your theory that designers should design for two years and not
for two weeks is logical, but what would prevent them from doing
both?  Start all new zones with TCC, run it that way for two weeks,
then strip the TCC off entirely.  There, two weeks of level protection
so the "appropriate" guys get in first, then probably a couple weeks
where the zone sort of sucks as it is overrun with some of the high
levels exploring (and getting their money's worth) and then it
settles down to a mix... unless they accidentally put ultra loot in
a lowbie zone so that the Pharmers never leave.  Even in the "overrun"
phase it shouldn't be as bad as it would be if the gloves were off
from the beginning, as the rush is split into two smaller units.

Good for two weeks, -and- good for two years.

Just a thought
