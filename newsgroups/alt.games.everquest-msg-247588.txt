Read it again.

"Online games such as Sony Corp.'s "EverQuest" and Microsoft Corp.'s
"Asheron's Call" charge players by the month, *but* the audience for such
titles is limited to several hundred thousand die-hard fans. (emphasis mine)

The reason why they mention EQ in this context is because it shows that
while they're wildly popular, the actual number of people who have purchased
the games and are paying the monthly fees are dwarfed by the numbers of
people who have purchased particular games that aren't MMOGs.  Game X may
have sold 10 million copies, but GameMaker Y of Game X may never see another
dollar from that after the 10 millionth copy was sold.  What I'm reading
into that is that they'll sell minor upgrade or addons online for those
games, and hence be able to exploit a title's profitability beyond the basic
sale.  If, say, Maxis would be able to sell a couple addons packages of
items or skins for the Sims for $2 a pop without having to do all the
development and conceptualization that a full blown Sims expansion would
require, and managed to sell that addon through an online transaction to
even a tenth of all the people who have the Sims, that's a huge boon to
them.  It'd probably be a lot more profitable per dollar spent on the
project than a traditional expansion.

While this may not be exactly what Andrew House was referring to in that
article, it *was* what everyone else quoted was referring to.

I'm still puzzled by the comments about Andrew House.  I don't know why he
wasn't quoted to the extent the other people mentioned in the article were,
and I don't understand how the actual quote he gave, about "online,
downloadable content", applies to transactions like IGE's or the
transactions through EBay.  There's no content being downloaded in those
transactions.

Plus, from the original quote you gave:

"publishers big and small buzzed about how the proliferation of game
consoles and PCs with high-speed Internet connections opened up new
opportunities....."

How are EBay or IGE-type transactions helped by the proliferation of high
speed net connections for consoles and PCs?  What new opportunities are
presented in that context that weren't available with a 56k or even a 28.8k
connection?

But addons and mini-expansions are very feasible if your customer base is
mostly high speed.   Expecting them to download a 100-200 meg add on isn't
outrageous with those speeds, and you know there's no way a game maker could
justify selling a full blown expansion for $25-30 with that little content,
not with most expansions these days running upwards of a gig or two of
content.  So they sell them online for much less, and reduce their overhead
since they don't have to produce hard copies of the software, and watch them
turn out more profitable, per amount invested, ventures.

It's a new possibility.
