Who runs by the AC island in OOT in passing?  Now that the boats are not a

This reasoning is flawed.  Your chance of winning the lottery TODAY are the
same as those of that regular player, sure.  But in the 12 years your chances
are one in 20 million, while his chances of having won once in 12 years are
1248 in 20 million more or less; FAR higher than yours (and still miniscule)

If your 5% chance estimate is correct, then your chances are a little worse
than 15% of getting a success with three tries, while the guy that stays for
100 tries approaches a 100% chance.

This plan works if you have something else to do with another character, or
have a porter character who can bind at the AC spawn.  Log on the AC
character, play as long as you like if the camp is open, and then log to
someone else.  If not, well, see below.

Here's whats wrong with your plan.  Setup time.  Getting to OOT spawn takes
time.  When you do get there, its often camped.  If you "pop by for a few
spawns" every day for a week, you spend say a half hour setting up each day,
camp for an hour, then move on, half the time.  The other half the time, you
spend the same half hour but don't get the spawn.  Lets say you play 6 days a
week just to make the math easy.  That means you spend 3 hours setting up and
3 hours trying the spawn, and have 3 hours worth of chances at a pop.  Now
lets say person B comes by but intends to stay for 6hours.  Day one spawn is
camped.  Day two its open so he takes camp and stays put.  He gets 5 and a
half hours of chances, but has still spent the same total time on the project
that you did, 6 hours.  His chance of a pop are nearly twice yours.

The best plan for doing this spawn is to do it in a way that is profitable
whether you get the AC to pop or not.  This means being able to kill
Seafuries, whether solo or with friends.  When a regular cyclops pops, you
kill that, when any of the massively lower level PHs pop you kill that, and
pull a Seafury to kill.  For most people interested in the ring, this is a
decent exp camp with decent cash/gems loot dropping.  If you are relatively
low level, bring a partner or group... preferably one willing to help you get
your ring instead of wanting to roll with you for it, that plan is silly.
