Heh, I didn't. I thought it was incredibly dull and lacking in either
imagination or inspiration.

Everything seemed to be "go here, kill everything that moves". Diablo
2 did that better. For NWN to have excelled as a single player game,
it needed to return to the true rpgs of the past, especially the style
of U7. It didn't do so, and now I'm waiting on a better connection to
play online with people. I have, for all intents and purposes, given
up on its single player component.

But I agree EQ has made all single player rpgs seem that much
shallower.
