...and what about the people who did break new ground? Doing it without
those AA points making most encounters significanly easier than any
weapons. 400hps on your MT as well as mitigation and avoidance. Casters
critting for over 4k regularly. Healers with more mana and less fizzles.

The first people to kill a mob, do so without step-by-step spoilers on
what to expect and how to execute it. They do so without having a clue
as to whether the rewards are worth it. They do so with a larger-than-
average risk of bugs ruining their day, because things haven't been
fully tested live. Uber loot is more commonly enhanced than nerfed, and
tweaking of encounters wroks both ways - sometimes tough mobs are made
easier but keep their loot table.

If you are 'hot on the heels' of another guild, you can kill everything
they farm, simply by making the effort on flawless execution and high
turnout. Player skill and attendance is considerably more crucial to
victory than a couple of weeks worth of loot.
