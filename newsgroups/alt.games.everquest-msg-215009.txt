Canning should not be costing anyone mana to regen or heal you, you are 
prefectly capable of taking care of that yourself.  Besides, why would 
someone be healing you, you should be busy healing the people you are 
grouped with, after you slow the mob.  If the only thing you have to do 
after slowing the mob (You do slow them, don't you? That takes 5 seconds, 
plus, Malosi if that is needed, another 7 seconds, which takes away from 
your nuking) is use your JBB, then you that means that you have someone 
else in the group who has to heal, which means that you don't have one 
more person doing damage instead.  When are you getting back the mana you 
expended to slow the mob?  Your chain JBB is doing just over 25DPS, you'd 
be far better served dumping the healer, and getting a DPS class instead, 
and doing the healing yourself.

Go get Stoicism, it has a great hp to mana heal ratio.  Keep yourself 
regenned, don't wait on natural regen.

At level 65, I constantly use cannibalize, cann V when it refreshes, cann 
IV in between.  Don't have Quiescence yet, but, I don't melee anyway, so 
I Torpor.  If need be, I use my gimp CH.  Either way, I gain back far 
more mana than I expend keeping my own health up.  I also keep myself in 
Replenishment, 24hp/tick regen, and I am wearing a fungi.
