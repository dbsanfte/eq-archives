Shaman as main healer works find, so long as there is somone else slowing, 
like, another shaman.  Shaman as main healer, and slower is a bit risky.  I 
do like how you seem to imply that malo will just fall into a shamans lap 
at level 60 too.  That statement should read:  Once you hit 60, if you get 
Malo, ...  Cheapest I have seen it for sale on EMarr now is 45k.  I have 
never seen all of the research items for it, I do have 2 of them.

I prefer having a cleric around, because deaths do happen.

I have crawled PoI with me as the main healer, a 51 shaman as the slower, a 
warrior, enchanter, monk, and paladin.  I had to slow a few of the mobs, 
but, overall, the 51 shaman did not have too much trouble.  He did die once 
due to too many resists getting him aggro, and he dropped before anyone 
could do much of anything.
