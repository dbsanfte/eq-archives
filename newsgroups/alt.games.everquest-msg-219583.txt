   This newsgroup is unmoderated, as others have pointed out.  This nice thing
about this is that anyone can reply to and say anything, which in my opinion
gives the group a more dynamic and vital nature.  The drawback is that we don't
really have a way to keep out spam.

   True enough.  I never said that you lied about your status as a persons who
spams.  Are you aware that internet spam is pretty much universally hated?

   You would have to pay for advertising on tv or the streets.  Advertising
here, on the other hand, is causing your victims to have to pay for your
indulgences.  We have to download your spam.  We have to take the time to read
it to figure out its nature.  Some of us pay by the amount of data we download,
or the amount of time we spend connected to the internet.  Even if others don't
directly pay this way, by sending out this sort of crap you are wasting
bandwidth, with the end result that we are using more of the resources of the
internet, which is indirectly being passed on to us.

   No, no.  I appreciate that you are taking the trouble to explain yourself. 
That is a Good Thing.  I was willing to give you the benefit of a doubt before
because your message was very short, and you might not have realized that it was
spam and what the negative consequences of this can be for the newsgroup.  I
think you are a weasel because you clarified that you know you are spamming, you
know that spam is damaging to this group (as you imply when you acknowledge that
if all MUDs spammed us we would be overwhelmed), but you still do it because it
is convenient, easy, and free for you to do so.  

> Exactly why did you think we advertised here? For fun or by accident?

You do it because you are a spammer.  You do it because it might benefit you, to
the detriment of those of us who are using the newsgroup in a way that the
regular users approve of.  You do it because you are a selfless weasel git.

> What have I said since that has changed your opinion?

  You've clarified that you know what you are doing, and don't care about the
negative consequences to the group as a whole since it might benefit you.

    Removed by whom?  Do you know the difference between moderated and
unmoderated newsgroups?  The only one that can remove your post is you, and even
then many newsgroups will ignore the "remove" tag and display the message
anyways.   The fact that your advertisement wasn't removed means absolutely
nothing.  It certainly DOES NOT mean that it is acceptable.

   I will tell you one of the most efficient tool we have to deal with spammers
like yourself.  It is call a "killfile".  The way it works is that a person
directs their newsreader to ignore either a certain person or series of words in
an incoming post.  They don't see whatever or whomever is offending them
anymore.  Out of sight, out of mind.  But the person who is being killfiled has
no way to know that they have been dealt with thusly, unless they are told so
(if someone tells you "Plonk!" this means they have done this to you).  Another
way is to report the spam to abuse@your_ips.net.  Darktyger has already done
this.

    I've been told that I do tend to have a hostile, condescending, or pompous
voice to my writing.  Usually I don't mean to come across this way, but this
time I did (well, not the "pompous" part).  You are spammer, you admit it
freely, you know that what you are doing is hurtful, but it's ok because it
might benefit you.  I do give you credit for being refreshingly honest, and
willing to vocalize what many spammer don't even bother to do when confronted. 
But these two good points do not erase the overall negative impact you are
having.

> Perhaps you don't speak for everyone in this forum.

    I probably don't.  But I would wager that I speak for most.
