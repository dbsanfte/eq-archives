Maybe you've come across this James.. it sure frustrated and annoyed the
heck out of us.

Second try on the Burrower in The Deep.. plow through the early stuff no
problem this time.. finally get to the Burrower.

This time were prepared (had about 45 people there, and a few bots).. engage
on him, start kicking his ass.  We have the rotation down, the melee box
problem down.. then all of a sudden he warped to the zone line! wtf??

He summoned various people to the zoneline including most of the cheal
rotation, then warped back to his bind spot and pwnt the rest of the raid.

So wtf did he do that? :(

http://www.mas.ukshells.co.uk/burrower.jpg   We had that pos too :(

Im guessing his room/the walls are really buggy or something?   Whats this
guys respawn?
