No.   Dodge is a skill enchanters learn at level 22.   Not terribly
effective, since it caps out at 75 skill... but every so often it does go
off.  You just must not have been paying much attention to it.

I thought avoidance AA's (and armor mods) were supposed to make things miss
you in melee combat, not just increase the few times you dodge / parry /
riposte?

So, for the sake of example, if a mob would normally hit you 60 percent of
the time, you're avoiding 40 percent of the blows.  CA 3 is a 10 percent
increase, so you would now be hit on average 56 percent of the time, and 44
percent of the swings would miss.

Any damage mitigation skills, block / dodge / parry / riposte would then be
rolled after the hit lands or misses.

So... assuming thats the way it works, it's a pretty good damage reduction.
It's not something you will visibly see scanning the numbers, but it should
show up in parses, and in the amount of healing you need over a period of
time.
