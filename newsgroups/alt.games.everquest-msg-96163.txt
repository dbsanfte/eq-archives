The other day my daughter was so excited when she finally got her 14th level
druid spells which included levititate. She levitated herself and was going
to levitate me also but after casting the spell I was still standing on the
ground.  Then she realized that she had clicked on the wrong person and
levitated some unsuspecting bystander.

Probably not what is happening, but we thought it was pretty funny.
