Well tried the exi trial lastnight. Group consisted of a 62 cleric, 65 wiz,
65 ench, 65 necro, 62 war and me....58 rogue. They told me to try so I did
heh.

Failed, cleric got aggro on the exe (other than that we were excellent). Ah
well will try again tonight. Guild is pushing to have people as low as 55
flagged for pov/pos.
