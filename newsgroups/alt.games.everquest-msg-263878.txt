Perhaps you would clarify =why= someone in UO felt the need to use a 
2ndary slave/mule character to do his crafting? I can't imagine why I'd 
roll a new character to accomplish what my main character could do just 
fine.

Generally mule crafters are created because a main character would have 
to sacrifice some 'adventuring' ability in order to craft optimally, but 
I can't speak directly to UO, as I haven't played it.
