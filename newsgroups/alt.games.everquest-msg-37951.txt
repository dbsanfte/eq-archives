October 16. You seem to think the developers, Mythic Entertainment, have
no hope of meeting their goal. I have no idea, really, whether they can
or not, but from reports from beta testers I have read, the game is
supposedly very stable. The company has been right on the mark for
incorporating new content into the betas in the past year I've been
following it. They are basing much of the game on their previous
text-based games, which they have about 10 years of experience with. I
don't think it's gonna "Kill EQ!", but I think they have a real chance
at making a game that I will happily split my gaming time between it and
EQ. It looks like it could be quite good; we'll know in a month and a
half =)
