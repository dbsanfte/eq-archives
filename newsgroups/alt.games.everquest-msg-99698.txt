I keep hearing that over and over, and as a programmer myself I understand
what everyone keeps saying.  However, anecdotal evidence keeps mounting:

- The XP requirement changes in the last patch
- The announcement of a new expansion where you can walk the planes and meet
the gods
- The statement by Mr. Humble

Let's think about it ... rebalancing would be a awesome task, but it could
be done.  There are players out there (I'm not one of 'em :-)) who have
retired lvl 60 characters years ago.  As it stands now, it takes multiple
high level groups to take Nag, Vox, or even Woushi.

Or perhaps some other ploy could be devised to eliminate the need to
rebalance every mid to high level area.  I don't know, let your imagination
run wild.  You can ding 61, but once you do, you can never leave the Planes
(a-la Raistlin in the DragonLance series ... he could become a god, but
never leave the Abyss).  Or something better.

But from looking around at the changes and announcement, ~something's~
afoot.

Just thinking at the keyboard.
