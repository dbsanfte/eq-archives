Talk to Garradain in Eastern Wastes, or look it up at Allakazams for quests
for that zone.

The Coldain Ring quests are great fun.  A series of 10 quests done in order.
Along the way they tell the story of a war between the giants and the dwarves.
Great fun.

The 10'th ring culminates in a four hour long invasion of Thurgadin by a giant
army, during which your force must protect the dwarven city.  If you fail,
then the entire city is killed, and stays dead for a couple hours.

Each quest results in a ring that is a little better than the last one.  First
ring is 1 ac, 1 str, 1 magic resist, and each step gets better by one each.
The 8'th ring also has a right clickable buff, "Shield of the Eighth", and the
10'th one has Regen and a right clickable Damage shield.  (not sure what is on
the 9'th one.)
