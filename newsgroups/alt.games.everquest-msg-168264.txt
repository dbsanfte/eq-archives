Not common practice for rezzes, but then there's a very good reason
why payment in advance would not work for rezzes. :-)

But then I generally don't ask for donations for rezzes unless I'm
grouped and the rez requires group downtime (in which case I offer
to split the donation). Not that I turn down spontaneous donations
(unless I've said in advance that the rez is a freebie).

Of course this means that the cleric accepts the risk when rezzing.
Personally I don't much mind. When you enter a transaction expecting
to receive nothing, anything is a bonus. :-)
