I agree.  Had a druid kite through us in EW.  We broke up the kite (Root +
Atone, great combo) and the druid /shouts that we nearly got him killed b/c
we disrupted his rhythm.  Shortly afterward I get a tell from the druid
asking for a rez (not a result of the broken kite, he screwed up all by
himself later on).  Oh the joys of laughing in someone's face that didn't
bother to bind closer.

Basically if you KS or train me, no Rez for you.  If you have helped me in
any way, Rez for free.  If I have to go to you to rez, its going to cost
something (even if that something is a promise to help in the future).
