I don't have to say a thing.  Take a look.  Compare AoE, AoE2, and AoM.
Three strategy games by the same developers, and they get easier each time.

Or try Command & Conquer / Red Alert / Tiberian Sun / RA2 / Generals.  Each
time the game is made easier while more content is added.

Or go through the Battleground series chronologically.  It's probably most
evident there.

I didn't invent this stuff, y'know.
