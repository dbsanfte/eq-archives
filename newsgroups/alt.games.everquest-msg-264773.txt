And deny ourselves the immediate gratification of starting to play as soon 
as physically possible? What are you, crazy? ;-)

I'm a light RP'er myself, I enjoy it and I employ it, but it's not my

in my experience the RP community is more interesting to be around than the 
general gaming population.
