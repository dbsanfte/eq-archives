This reminds me a great deal of the jerks who whine incessantly in /ooc
about having three level 60s who are going to come kick X's butt for not
doing whatever the jerk wants (port, sow, get in a group, join their guild,
etc). Having uber characters does not prevent anyone from being an asshole.
And just cause some ass claims to have uber characters doesn't mean they
really do, or for that matter, know how to play level 60 they really have.
We brought Shelston, level 60 enchanter, on a Phinny raid. He nicely gave
everyone KEI, then went AFK without telling anyone (apparently), because he
sure as hell didn't try to mezz anything. Yes I know those seahorses and
Phinny can't be mezzed- but there were other pops there too that he just
plain ignored. Idiots abound, even at high levels.

Have met nice folks at all levels, thank goodness, or I'd have tossed the
game.

This is not the newsgroup alt.fluffy.bunnies, so grow a thick skin or go
away.
