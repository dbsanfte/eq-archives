Well as I made plain, I know that Shamen (as well as other classes) have
precious little to offer in the actual fight with the boss-guy, there is
plenty more to a raid than just this, and every class gets their chance to
contribute. Most of the unhappy shamen I know say it's got very little to do
with their effectiveness in the fights but that they are bored of buffing
after 60 levels of it. I mean, even pre-SoV 90% of a shamans life on raids
was buffing and for the boss mobs they would then slow/debuff and usually
die. All they are missing now is that 10% of their role, and then only in
the Final Battles. There is an argument to be made that this was what
defined the class, what made it indispensible, but it's still true. Even
armour-farming in ToV becomes a nightmare with none-to-substandard Slows and
every melee on the raid missing the ~600hp they would get from Shaman buffs.
Either way it is a shame for Shamen and they are another casualty of the
design of >32k HP mobs. As I see it, there is little choice but to make
these mobs unslowable. Slowed they would become too easy with their current
damage output reduced by 75%. So if VI then scaled UP their damage so that
when Slowed they were as dangerous as they are now, nobody would survive
long enough to get the debuffs on in the first place.
