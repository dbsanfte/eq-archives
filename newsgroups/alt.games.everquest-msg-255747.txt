    Thankee... don't think anyone's ever said that about one of my posts
before.

    In retrospect, I agree that it was poor strategy at the time, however,
it got me to 52 probably faster than I otherwise would have got there (I
really WAS sick of grouping), and it did put me in a rather weak situation
which was then a nice challenge to get out of :)

    Because I had been shown it and realised the experience was almost
double what I would make anywhere else, and I knew that I could gear up a
little and then tank there. I guess I was also determined that being a tank,
and therefore gear-dependant, would not lock me out of the faster
experience.

    Karnors seemed to be worse experience than soloing - hence why I did 52
solo in the dreadlands instead of going to karnors at 50 like everyone else.

    I suppose you can read a lot into that, but I did try other zones as
well - soloing in maiden's eye was abysmally slow and not very challenging,
and non-planar groups tended to consist of all kinds of people who couldn't
make it in the planes (as well as people who could, but didn't want to for
whatever reason of course)

    Yeah, I wanted one very early on, having done the maths myself, but
unfortunately when we bought the price was rising again because others had
cottoned on - still it's been worth the money, only just replaced the thing
the other night.

    That is a problem with the necro and enchanter classes, and it should
not be worked around by denying content and drops to single and small groups
of other classes.

    I found that for a hybrid tank the drops were right up there - I haven't
done a comparison with top-end velious, but certainly drops such as the
ritual talisman of fate, boots of the kunzar wanderer, the nice plate helm
etc were the best I could lay hands on until LDoN.

    Maybe I don't actually care how the drops compare to the top level
stuff, but I do expect to be able to group upgrades to my group-drop gear in
each expansion. It looks like I can (barely) do this with GoD so maybe I'm
happy with it, time will tell.

    Having only done one of the Sewer trials, I have limited scope for
comment, but I can say that although the trials themselves might be
unwinnable for a duo, the shammy/SK duo I used to form would crush those
mobs like the bugs they are. Named might be a challenge tho :>

    I look forward to seeing some drops on the other trials :)

    I've done a few HarDoN's and have had one upgrade drop so far. I mainly
like them for the exp and the huge points - when elemental level gear lands
on LDoN merchants I will probably be HarDoNing my way to it in short order.

    I kinda got burned out on LDoN's though, there was a loooong period
where we didn't have the firepower or armour to tackle the hards, and
getting even four pieces of LDoN gear at 51pts/adventure inevitably means
some insanely repetitive work. Not a good peice of design, that.

Cheers,
James
