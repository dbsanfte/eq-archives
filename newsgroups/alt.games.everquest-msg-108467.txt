Ah, fair enough. Yes. The link broke and I followed the wrong one. And
you're talking about a tank who's no longer being a "tank" in any sense
of the word. He's equipped with an item that has effectively turned him
into another wizard for the AoE group. Which is, of course, cool,
because then you can use him for an actual tank if everyone goes OoM and
you need something bashed. 

Sorry. My bad. I thought you meant a melee hitting for 300,000 damage of
*melee* damage per minute. Obviously silly.

Some other threads here pointed out high end druids who tank on some
encounters because of bizarre gear not intended for casters.

You use what you get and what works. Sounds like a winner unless it
get's nerfed.
