    Yes. The key is off Prast Ianitor (or something like that), and is No
Rent. Unless you keep a key corpse in zone, you need a new one every time
you want to kill Grieg. I believe that key is also the key to the Servitor
of Luclin, a much easier mob with so-so drops.

    Oh, for XP the zone is a hole. The front end is horribly misconned, and
by the time you get deep enough to see blues you really don't want to stay
any more.

    Grieg and Servitor are raid encounters. Prast isn't, from what I recall,
but only drops that key. Alchemist isn't a raid encounter, and drops a +10%
Alchemy item usually. Praetorian Myral is a couple of groups encounter,
depending on what he is holding. If he has the DA hammer (nice hammer for a
PAL/SK but the proc is awful), then you need to plan how you'll take him
down and it'll be a long fight. If he has the scythe or (if you're lucky)
the Wand of Casual Blessings then he's a straightforward fight, if a bit
long. There may be other nameds in there, but they didn't have anything we
needed so we never killed them.

    Try organizing a small Myral raid. He's right near the SD zone, as in
clear two mobs and you're at him. He also on Recuso faction, so he's base
indifferent. If he doesn't have that hammer I bet you could one-party him,
although be aware he has massive HPs (seems to take forever to kill him).
Very tankable though, hits in 200's, flurries but not often enough,
debuffable.
