I'd enjoy that.

The graphics systems of the day weren't up to the lighting challenge. 
Carrying a gls in the Karana's was useless... the limitations of simple 
vertex lighting models were painfully apparent...

At any rate it demonstrates that night blindness 'as a vision feature' 
wasn't the problem. However looking at a black screen, even while 
holding a lightsource -was a problem-.
