He did ask specific questions.  They were:

1) Which class do you think is best?
2) Which race/class should I be?
3) Which race/class do you think sucks?

Well, ok, the questions weren't exactly that, but the answers will be as
useful.  It's his guild, it's not a popularity contest, he needs to create
it as something he'll enjoy being a part of.

"What makes a good guild" is answered 300,000 different ways if you ask
300,000 different people.  Why bother asking such a question at all when the
ONLY opinion that's ANYWHERE NEAR important is your own?
