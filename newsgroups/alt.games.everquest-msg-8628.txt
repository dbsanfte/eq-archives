Well, if you're looking for good prices, go to one of the older
servers, where there's tousands of copies of every item in existance.

And to be honest, with all the new territory out now, if you have a
problem finding something to hunt, it's your own fault.  Move about a
bit.  It's amazing how many good hunting grounds go unused because
everybody thinks they have to be in the oasis and lake of ill omen.
