Well, generally I root after a second failed Taunt or if I am not
MT (root usually holds until a nuke or proc, so it buys time for
the MT to build agro).  Another thing I often do is toss a heal on
somebody before breaking mez.

I always plan to get beat on, just not as much as a Warrior.  The one
long lasting group I had in Sebilis the MT was consuming about 4 CHeals
for every one the Cleric hit me with, and I was chain stunning every
caster plus anything that went after one of our casters, so it seemed
like I was getting my job done without getting too much agro.
