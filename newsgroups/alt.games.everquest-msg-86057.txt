And let me guess, he pops right on the statue's corpse immediately,
right? Assuming your guild is barely capable of taking the statue, WTF
do you do then? Just throw a couple melee on him and try to camp all the
clerics and a couple rogues as far away as possible?

And how the hell do you loot the statue?

"You tell the Avator of War, 'Excuse me, old chap. Don't mind me. Just
grabbing a few things off this statue. I'll be moving along shortly.
No.. no... don't bother showing me out. I can find the zone, thank you.'
