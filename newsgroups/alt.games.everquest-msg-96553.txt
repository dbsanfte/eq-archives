I had the exact same thing happen to me in South Qeynos the other night, 
couldn't go near anything that would normally have sound (i.e. the clock or 
the bank), even turning down my speakers didn't help, North Qeynos however 
was fine. Bug reported it, but they probably just brushed it off as 'bah, fix 
your audio dummy'.

Glad to hear its just not me :)
