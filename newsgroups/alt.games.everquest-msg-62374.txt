I agree 100%....Usually I spend LOTS of time in a game (and applications)
setting up macros, GUi, etc. to my liking... But, I guess with EQ, there was
few options back when it came out, I learned to play with what was there,
and I didn't spend the time to learn/adjust when they added new features....

Right click mouse, totally agree....I hated that.....but instead of making
it left click...give us the option to make it left or right, or middle...I
mean, give me the customability options.....Oh yeah, the drag n drop item in
chat window thing was great....totally eliminated the /ooc What are the
stats on that?
