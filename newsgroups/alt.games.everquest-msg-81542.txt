Purely character based. If your an asine asshole, you can relatively quickly
make cash. Or if you got the immunity tot total boredom to sit for weeks in
EC, doing the trading game (buy low, sell high) etc. My level 54 Shaman
owns a total of 900 pp. My friends are somewhere in the dozens of thousands
of pp *shrug*. Never really bothered me. I always gave everything away to 
newbie friends, that still play (even Wu Trance Sticks etc and other things
worth several thousand). That left me poor, but I rarely buy items anyway,
I hunt them down. Can't say I'm really badly equipped right now :)

I sometimes have people paying me 3 pp for a SoW. It's a more or less usual
payment *if* anyone pays it. I normally reject it, though, as most people
ask it outside a fight .. and asking money for a mouseclick at level 54
is silly.

Well, you're really at levels here wher being broke is normal. YOu're still far
away from being bale to cover your simple spell costs. At your level, my shaman
was walking around in stained paper. I didn't ask, where to get a Black
Crystalline RObe and whatever people expect at level 10 nowadays :)

: just curious as to whether there was a class that was more broke than
: others, generally speaking.

No, I don't think that has anything to do with class. Most people group
and there you get your share (or not), doesn't really matter what you
are in a group, lootwise (apart from the high level game 55+). You'll
mass up a few pp after level 20 (some 100 if you're lucky and to lazy to
do trading). At 40, I was finally getting some 600 pp or more through
simply looting the exp mobs .. 600 because I had some expenses for my
armour quests etc that also were in the couple of hundreds, costwise.
At that level you can own a lot more if you can be bothered to hunt
hill giants in groups etc .. but that a;ways annoyed thehell out of me.
