The only racist person here is the one suddenly feeling a need to defend
Sweden and continue to press the neeed to emphasize something, with no
provocation or real basis.

The Russians spent much of the war fighting a bloody hard defensive
operation. My hat is off to them. They took advantage of Hitler's idiotic
move to attack in the fall and made the best of it, while also being
overwhelmed but still winning the battles.

Let's not also forget after that, NATO spent a long time making sure Sweden
didnt end up speaking Russian at some point.

But that is old news, the world moves on... When Sweden is willing to stop
being this sheep pen of side liners, willing to sacrifice, and help
reinforce policy as in picking a side and supporting it with tangible,
quantifiable effort, then I will be more symapthetic. Until then, they will
probably continue to gravitate to the strongest and play the sideline. That
is my opinion. And in my eyes, one that is earned. Racism doesn't even
factor into it.
