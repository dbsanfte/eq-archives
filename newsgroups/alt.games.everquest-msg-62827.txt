I Just had this problem and fixxed it, it pissed me off.... spent 2 hours
about, fixin it
I... deleted vital EQ files and redownloaded them... Tried even more of them
(gequip, global stuff, dll's, some exes, and some others)
deleted and reinstalled latest drivers, DX8.1
then it came down to delete almost every file in eq (all but my hotkeys),
reinstalled from Kunark and Velious cd's, and downloaded the patch...
that worked.
