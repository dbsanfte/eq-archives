Trying this out some more in Gunthak this morning, where I can kill 
stuff without paying a lot of attention because it doesn't run and 
doesn't hit all that hard, I found my 80% figure to be way out of whack; 
when I pulled pairs the add was generally at around 94% when I turned to 
him.  This means rather than 20% of my output, the DS is about 6% of my 
output, again assuming my logic is right:

Killing mob A = 100% of my output
Mob B at 94% = 6% of my output over the same span of time.

I hear the thing procs at level 22, I bet at that point it would be a 
huge boost!
