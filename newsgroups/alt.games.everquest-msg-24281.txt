I've researched this a lot (I'm a faction junkie, my Paladin is
beloved in Cabilis and Neriak, and allied with *both* the
Freeport Militia *and* the Knights of Truth), and all my
research leads me to the conclusion that the only way to
increase Indigo Brotherhood faction is to permanently hose
several "good" factions, including a lot of the Kelethin and
Rivervale factions.

Now -- does anyone know of a practical way to gain Grobb or Ogguk
faction standing if you've begun KoS with them?
