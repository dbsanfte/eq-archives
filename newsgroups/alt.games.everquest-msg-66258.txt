  None of the big EQ sites seem to have more than three or four Luclin
screenshots other than the preview shots.  I'm particularly curious about
what erudites (who look a little eggheaded in the screenshots from what I've
seen so far, but oh well) look like in chain and plate armor.  I'm curious
about what the other races look like too, of course.

  So does anybody know of a good site for these sorts of pictures?  Maybe
some guild with a good webmaster that has screenshots of half the guild in
the new models?  Thanks.
