I love the way you always snip what you don't like or makes you look
like an ass, always, it's a DT trademark.
OK DT, just leave out the part where you told the OP that if he wanted
to play an asian to pick a monk, just in case you forgot, here i'll
C/P it here for you: DT said, "Asian, well...play a human monk."
That's purely a racist comment or you are just ignorant in thinking
that only "Asians" know martial arts. But that's OK just leave it out.
And no, I don't believe or pretend to be an expert on your mind, only
you know what you really think, and I never said you "Were" a racist,
I only said that it was a racist comment.

OMG whose back pedalling here is you DT and here's another DT
trademark, if some ones even remotely has the upper hand you shout
"TROLL", wrong , no troll here. Just someone that read your comment,
which by the way you still have danced around and not cleared up your
meaning, and thought it wrong. But you'll more than likely just waltz
over it and say something like, "see he is a troll" or "if you were
smart you'd understand" or some other BS to take away attention to you
comments. Keep dancing DT, it suits you.
