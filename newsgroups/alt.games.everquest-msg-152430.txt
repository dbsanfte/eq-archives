I suppose I'm just not endgame oriented enough, I see things
somewhat differently.

Problem that I see warriors having is that they aren't as good
at their job as they should be, and other classes keep getting
better at doing the warrior job as things progress.

Warriors exist to soak damage.  They should be the best
at mitigating damage and then have the most HP to soak
up what damage does get thru.  Once upon a time, this
was true, and still is true in an environment free of anything
resembling twinking... but noone has played in an environment
like that in ages.

I say "resembling" because currently even a player who
has made only one character and not recieved any gifts
or help from friends whatsoever can still get much
better gear than someone could have a year ago.  Better
gear is dropping, which degrades the prices of all older
gear, and the addition of the bazaar means far more
people are out there selling stuff, dropping the prices
of gear still further while increasing availability massively.

This, coupled with the addition of more and more all/all
gear, means that traditionally AC/HP handicapped
classes will normally have better AC and HP than
comperable leveled warriors did a year ago; and insofar
as AC goes, can easily get up to the soft cap for the
mobs they are facing, where a warrior with hundreds
more AC doesn't see any appreciable further mitigation.

Ignoring Defensive, which is a moderatly high level
discipline, and which is only available on a timer, which
means for big mobs only, decently equipped monks
can do more or less just as well sponging as warriors
can; perhaps a bit less well with a cleric healer towards
the high end, but arguably better with shaman/druid
healers

My suggestion is to remove or significantly alter the
soft cap AC, such that more AC continues to mean
more mitigation.  AC should never mean complete
mitigation, but if 1000 AC means taking half damage,
then 1500 AC should mean taking quarter damage
and 2000 AC should mean taking eighth damage,
something along those lines.  Diminishing returns, but
not like the current situation where 1200, 1500, and
2000 all mean about the same thing.

Secondly, AC and HP on warrior items should be
better than that found on all/all items.  But this penalizes
warriors who get ahold of those endgame items.  So
my alternate suggestion would be to make the benefits
of some items class based.  Like the level based item
reductions on certain items (when you are below the
"reccomended" level for the item) class based reductions
or increases could be put in place.  Thus an item
that has 51 AC and 150 HP for a warrior, Paladin, SK,
Bard, or Cleric, might have only 41 AC and 125 HP for a
rogue,  ranger, or shaman and a "mere" 31 AC and 100 HP
for a  monk, beastlord, or druid, and a pitiful 21 AC and
75 HP for a pure caster
