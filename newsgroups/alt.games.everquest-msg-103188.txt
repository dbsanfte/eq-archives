Can geet used to it. My Iksar Shammie has not many problems. There's the
nexus and you can bank in Bazaar etc.

Uhm, Antonic is about as boring :) Field of Bone is arguably the best
Newbie area there is, no idea what you are talking about. Loads of
fast spawning mobs directly at your footstep, none of that running
around in the bloody dunes of South Ro, none of the getting surprised
by desert madmen and very easy to find mobs for any level.

oring? Yes. Going the fastest standard way: FoB -> LOIO -> FM/OT ->
DL/KC is good exp and boring as hell.

I am a european timezone on an american server, maybe that's why, but I find
loads of mobs for me in LOIO. I avoid all the standard group places (Mill,
Fortress etc) like the plague. LOIO newbies are about the most annoying
kind of encounter you can have. Lake of Ill Manners it is :)

Kunark is designed self contained for Iksar (or others, apart from not being
able to go through the 'nexus' that cabilis is). It has lots to offer
but you need to be open about it and not just exactly do 'run along the
edges'. If you're adventurous, there's lots to see. Nobody ever goes to Nurga
or Droga. Have you done a village raid in Swamp of No Hope? Hunted down the
named cycle in FM? Been to Charasis in The Overthere? Or try running aorund
as a lowbie < 10 in Warslik Woods if you need that 'I get killed any minute
now' thrill. :)

Personally, I prefer Kunark to Antonica *shrug* :)
