I dunno, I think the most amusing mob in the game (in my experience,
at least) can be seen in the Warrens- watching the Muglwump
squish-hopping around his lair, we were laughing so hard we almost let
him get away. Worth a trip to the Warrens for that, even if you find
the rest of the dungeon unbearable.
