Does anyone know the formula for post-200 mana yet?

My druid doesn't need the AC, but he DOES have a bunch of mana-adds items on
top of his 201 Wis... so do I swap out the +20mana rings for the +6 Wis
again? (yeah, both plat... couldn't afford the Vel Wis rings, and the mana
rings don't come in Velium flavour)
