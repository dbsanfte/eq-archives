Hi Ray,

I remember having wandered and wondered some time.
In fact the following steps are crucial:
- read the scroll in your inventory and give it to the person mentioned
there (guild leader), and do some 'practice' (right mouse button) like 1hb
or so (check if your weapon is 1hb or 2 hb or so)
- go out of the city and kill rats (or snakes)
- loot them and sell the loot to some merchant.

Keep doing this for some levels.
Oh yes, to see if there is a possibility to kill an opponent you can check
with the right mouse button).

these are some essential. I may have missed some (like running back to the
guards when your red bar is very small) but that's it. Don't be bothered
with the quests at this moment.

Happy hunting
Carlo
