Not in a pickup group.  In a pickup group of strangers NBG is usually
a code standing for "I'm a greedy asswipe who only hunts where loot I
"need" drops, and I expect you to help me get said loot without
compensation".

I find the tone of his post to be considerably less arrogant than yours,

All arguments, logical or not, are based on assumptions.  Try again.

Wrong.  He has presented a reasonably clear argument, and done a better
job than is usual in this forum of making clear where his position is
based on opinion, as opposed to the habit employed by many of stating
opinions as facts (yes, I too am guilty).  Logic in and of itself is
utterly indifferent to the premise(s) of the argument it supports.
Start with false assumptions, and the most rigorous logic is pretty
well certain (barring bizarre coincidence) to lead you to false
conclusions.

I do not have sufficient evidence to judge whether you are a fool, but
this post of yours is rather exceptional in its foolishness when
compared to others of yours I have read.  Of course, compared to usenet
as a whole I could give it no better than a 4.5 for foolishness.
