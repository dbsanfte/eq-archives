What a joke. None of those items have a mana free 96% rez.
They are not even comparable.

The cleric epic is arguably the best epic in the game.
The savings on downtime for a raid wipe out is huge.

Bottom line is if you are in a guild that has big raids its
very very much worth it. If you just adventure in small groups
and are a casual player then no.
