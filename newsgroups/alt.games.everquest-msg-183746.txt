I agree, I went to MS with my cleric after paludal, and kept trying
other zones.  I found MS sucked ass, DSP was better, yes even at 26... 
MM & splitpaw entrance was really good, better loot in MM though, never
got into HK though, and CC was just too hard to get to, too many mobs
agroing at once, with no one to group with.

I didn't find it particularly easy until 28, I was getting far too many
adds too quick, sure there's the zone there, but if you spend half your
time running to them it's no good.
