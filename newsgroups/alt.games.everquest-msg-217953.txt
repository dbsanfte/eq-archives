Bot and hoh will let you in as soon as you hit level 62. You can enter
before then if you kill the glass dragon for hoh (mob found in pov) , or do
a quest requiring you kill 2 nasty giants in sky (bot).

VT is entirely diffrent and quite possibly the most obnoxious quest to date.
Since ldon and pop are out I strongly recommend you juts leave it alone
entirely. It requires killing 10 diffrent mobs in 10 diffrent zones
thousands of times to get 10 shards. It requires killing an emperor in ssra
. It requires some questing. Figure 3-6 monthes of full time guild activity
to complete keys for most members and some serious guild grief. Pop flagging
is much easier in comparison and while the elementals may be a bit stingier
on gear is much more fun. A full fennin run can net you lots of good gear if
the counselors drop nicely .
