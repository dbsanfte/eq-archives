They haven't in my case. After doing the quest and putting the necklace 
on I still con dubious to most merchants in the zone and they still 
won't sell to me. There are some who I con amiable to (mostly around the 
Nexus zone) but I think this is a result of another trader quest I did a 
few times which involved running back and forth delivering notes to one 
of the gnome traders in the bazaar.
