I notice you made no attempt to answer the

accounts benefit Verant?

Now, now... stop getting hysterical, and leaping
into one of your typically inappropriate, and
leaden-footed, analogies.

It has nothing to do with being a criminal, petty
or otherwise. 

It was about honour.

What I would like to see, is you, telling a
decorated war-hero, that he has no honour, because
he shared his Everquest account.

I'll even send you the fee for the ambulance and
possibly, proctologist.
