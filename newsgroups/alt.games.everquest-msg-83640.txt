Heres the secret to fear kiting.

When something is fleeing from you, it does not swing back when you hit it.

Snare, cast fear, then follow along behind it smacking it in the back while it
tries to get away.   When fear drops, cast it again.     Arrows will not do
the kind of damage that you are after.  You will want to melee.  And since it
is not attacking back, your main advantage of using nukes and arrows (that
they allow you to attack from outside of it's current melee range) is
irrelevant.   It won't be hitting you whether you are next to it or a mile
away.
