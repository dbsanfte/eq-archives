As far as my experiences with Necromancery go (and I've had a LOT of
experience as a necromancer since I have played a Necromancer all the way
from 1 to 53) FD is an all or nothing spell, if it works, be happy, if it
doesnt, you're screwed, especially since we Necros have VERY low HP.

You can tell if FD has worked or not by looking at your screen when you cast
it, if it says "Soandso has fallen to the ground" it means that FD has
failed and the mob will return to munch on you. If there's no message at all
it generally means it's succeeded, however, just to be sure, keep the mob
targetted and /con it to make sure you're Indifferent to it. If you're still
Scowling or Threateningly to it then FD has failed and you should
IMMEDIATELY stand up, run in the opposite direction until the FD spell
renews and recast it, if it fails again, run away again and try again (this
IS assuming you've managed a successful fear). Eventually it'll work, either
that or you'll get sick of it and try to zone OR you'll die, either way,
you'll be away from the mob :)

Oh, 1 more thing, mobs at level 30 and above dont forget so easily of your
crimes against them, sometimes the mob will think you're dead and it'll wipe
it's aggro too, other times it'll think you're dead but not wipe the aggro
meaning that when you stand up you'll have 1 very pissed off fully
regenerated (depending on the damage you did to it, etc.) mob charging like
a freight train in your direction. As for a way to increase the chance of
success, I don't know of a way for Necromancers to raise the chance that the
spell will work the way it is intended to. However, I suggest that you keep
your Abjuration skill maxed as much as you can, I know it's a hassle, a pain
in the ass AND a timewaster as far as the amount of hunting you could be
doing in that time but it WILL pay off, guaranteed.

I hope this helps.
