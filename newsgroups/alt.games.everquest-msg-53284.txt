I've always found Stonebrunt to be a decent hunting ground. Severely
underrated. By the way, I've never had a problem with greenie kobolds
aggroing me beyond the normal situations (I'm extremely low HP, I sat
down next to one, they're really high green). Even when I pull a blue
from right beside them.
