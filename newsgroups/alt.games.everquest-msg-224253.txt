Subject: Clerics *donating* peridots??

I joined a group tonight 50 - 57 - all strangers.
I get a /tell IMMEDIATELY:  would you donate the peridots for a group virtue? 
From one of my group members!!!
My response:  "Hello?  Shouldn't that be a group expense? "  no response from
the asker.  
No one offers to pay for my KEI, why should anyone expect me to donate the dots
for a group virtue??? HELLO????
FWIW, I made 90 plat on my LDON adventures tonight.  I spent 80 plat on dots,
and another 40 for KEI..   I'm glad to only be 30 behind.  
Last but not least:  if you offer to *reimburse* for the dots I spent on you,
don't wait 15 minutes, until I've left the zone.  No, I'm not going to run all
the way back for 19 plat, DUH!
But expect THIS in the future, if you don't know me:  "I only have 3 dots left,
please donate 10 plat or a peridot for your temperance."
Be prepared!!!
