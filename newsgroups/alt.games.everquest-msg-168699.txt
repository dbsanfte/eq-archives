I don't even lose playing time.  I have a bazaar mule...  Drop some
batwings, fresh fish, and anything else that would never be sold on the mule
for 10K each.  See what happens over the course of a month.

Could be quite funny...

platpharmer_1 tells you "I made an error...Could you refund that 40K I just
gave you for the batwings?  It was for random_buyer_167."
You tell platpharmer_1 "I am currently not available for discussions at this
time.  You may want to speak with my attorney."
platpharmer_1 tells you "Are you there???"
You tell platpharmer_1 "No."
platpharmer_1 tells you "YES YOU ARE.  I WANT MY PP!!!"
You tell platpharmer_1 "I am currently not available for discussions at this
time.  You may want to speak with my attorney.  Regaring your PP, you may
want to speak with your doctor."
