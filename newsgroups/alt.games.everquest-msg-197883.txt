Or, add up the levels of all the characters I've played and it's 
perfectly reasonable, fwiw.

I can see how that might be the case. Does that mean that only *those* 
players should even be considered feasible for the trials? I wouldn't 
think so. I would think they are just your best chance, naturally.

Let me just say this. If I develop a bond with guildmates by hunting with 
them all the time as we help each other whenever needed, progressing 
through the levels together, I don't throw that bond out the window just 
because I got flagged and can now to shoot up to 65 and rake in the 
AAP's. Why would I be any less inclined to help them over this hurdle as 
well? Why would *you*?

Why would they be useless in those post-trial xp groups? Are we talking 
about getting low-50's flagged here? Mid-fifties? I think if they are not 
of appropriate level for those later xp groups, then they should 
understand perfectly the need to hunt elsewhere until they can attain a 
more appropriate level. I'm hearing that they need to pass the trial to 
do that. Well, at that point, they would be through it and the world 
should be their oyster.

If they're not in a hurry, then it shouldn't be a problem, right?
