You did a /guildstatus on him to determine if he was guilded?

I was in a similar situation in a group a while back in PC when a couple of
people (PL'ing) decided to take the whole cave (we were happy to share) and
when we complained got a guildmate in and trained us.  I was a bit slow on
the /report, but it is immortalised in my eqlog.txt file.  Not that it
counts for anything as it can be changed I suppose, but I don't buff or go
near anyone in that guild ;)
