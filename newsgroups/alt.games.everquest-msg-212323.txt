What would you high level enchanters suggest for AA to get for me?  I'm
going to be level 62 pretty soon and have my first 6 out of the way and one
in the bank.

I'm not going to 65 for my own reasons and will be cranking AA for quite a
while at 62.

My guild is about 75% casual.  We do about 2 raids a week, and they usually
aren't huge ones, but we usually field 4+ groups, level 60-61 average for
these things.  I won't ever be a part of a serious raid guild if that
influences the choosing.

I'm getting MGB for these minor raid situations and will be getting as much
extended buffage as possible for personal reasons.  Besides those, what
should I be shooting for?  I rarely, if ever these days, solo - but that
isn't out of the question in the future.

Thanks for your input,
-Zym
