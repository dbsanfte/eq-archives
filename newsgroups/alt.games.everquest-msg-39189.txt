Well I did (for a while) till I got bored. What would that have done to 
improve the situation? Sure I could have petitioned and waited an hour 
or so for a guide or GM to come watch the dingus' habits. But, I felt 
running around the ruins for a while right in his face made me feel 
better then I left. (Not to mention HAD Pyz shown her face my fiance's 
druid would've nuked her to hell and back ;) )
