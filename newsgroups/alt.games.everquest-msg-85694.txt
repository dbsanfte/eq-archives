you want eggs eh.... well I did my best egg hunting in Paineel newbie
area...
Just kill every snake you see.... many drop 3 or 4 eggs at a time.
I was there gathering up some bones for my young necro, and my wife
asked if Id try to get some eggs from the roaming snakes.

to our suprise at how many did drop...

good hunting.
