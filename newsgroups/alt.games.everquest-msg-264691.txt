EQ's problems were for the initial 2 weeks and weren't server issues. 
Their problem was that they didn't get the internet pipeline 
infrastructure in place because they didn't think they would do as well 
as they did, so they had to play catch up and get more bandwidth from 
multiple providers and that took a little time.
