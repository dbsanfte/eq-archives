    Cornering, with a few exceptions, eliminates the "back" from the mob,
dropping rogue DPS like a stone. It can also kill archery DPS if a mob ends
up pushed into two walls, as opposed to one. And if a mob starts to Gate,
you want to be able to push it to interrupt the gate - and a cornered mob
can't be pushed. Cornering is a lazy habit, basically. If you can corner it,
then with proper placement you can pin it on one wall.
