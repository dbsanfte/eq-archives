You left out the most likely possibility: that the difference you're
seeing is random statistical noise. :-)

What's the reset delay on FD?  6 seconds?  10?  (I know, I know, it
seems like FOREVER when you're waiting to feign again after a failure. :-)
It shouldn't be too hard to set up a controlled test where you can be
sure of how many times you attempt FD (the following assumes a 6-second
reset):

/pause 65,/doability <FD>
/say Standing up
/stand

Set that up and start spamming the hotkey.  (Use autofire if you've
got it.)  As long as the /pause is long enough for FD to reset, the
hotkey will lock out re-invoking it until after the /stand, so you
can be sure each time the hotkey fires you really did attempt FD.
Easy enough to count the failures vs successes.

I think I'll do this experiment myself, but I can't reach Sol Ro Temple
to check that zone specifically.  But my own rough estimate from earlier
log parses was that I'm failing only about 2-3%, so your claim of 5-7%
has me wanting to get a more dependable number.
