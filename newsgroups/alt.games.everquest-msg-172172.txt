I dunno, there is some good acting in LotR.  I never really cared for
Viggo Mortensen before this (not that I'd seen him all that much), but
I think he's doing an EXCELLENT job as Aragorn.  This counters the
Gimli situation, but in all honesty that doesn't bother me too much.
Considering that there are something like nine principal (by that I
mean, getting a lot of screen time) characters in the story, so
someone was going to have their roll reduced a bit.  Yeah, it's a
shame he was reduced to comic relief, but I'm sorry, I laughed my ass
of at the dwarf tossing bit.  :-)

Because Gandalf looked much better sitting atop a white horse.
