Cool!  Various members of my guild have been camping that wand
unsuccessfully. Last night I wasn't killing any of the Burynai.. the first
couple ran and I wasn't in the mood to go chasing greenies all around that
place. I had enough of that with the annoying skulking brutling part of the
shackle quest. The Burynai didn't aggro on me, so I just concentrated on the
skeletons.

Of course, I've got to go back down there for the one last finger. I didn't
have the patience for killing more greenies after getting my "prize."
