Thanks for the advice all.  Looks like I'll stay away from satellite, and
hope they upgrade the phonelines out here someday soon.  They are back to
normal as of today tho, so im good for a few more days at the
greased-lightning speed of 26k.  And it's not the comp, the phone lines
where I'm at really are bad, for the last few days I couldn't stay connected
to EQ for more than 2 minutes or the internet for more than 10.  Plus
dropped calls while talking on the phone, static, etc.  And of course the
phone company doesn't answer the phone or show up when they supposed to.
Lag was the least of my problems!  So I wait until Cable comes down our
road, and get used to the deteriorating reliability of my landlines.
<insert heavy melodramatic sigh here>
ANYWAY, thanks again for the advice, and for listening to me whine!
