I've left corpses to rot, but usually only with a root on them. If my
rez timer runs out I try to clean up the mess after me, but if I
forget and go somewhere else, I'm not running back to Permafrost for
the sake of one vegetable (that was my previous life)

I once saw a treeform corpse in Cazic Thule for three days in a row.
It was kind of hard to miss, as he'd died just at the doorway to the
throne room and everyone had to click inside his body just to open the
door.

You better believe that without (and probably even with) this warning,
some people are going to have corpses around and lose stuff... same
thing happens when they split servers - corpses don't move with your
character.

Eww. Ask a level 24+ druid to wolf up and pull it to zone for you?
