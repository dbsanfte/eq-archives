It all depends on the target. I saw even level paladins solo stuff I
couldn't touch, and I soloed stuff they couldn't touch.

I can't actually remember what level I last had problems rooting in
Velk's in, but I lived there 53-57. Main problem solo was adds and the
fact that those spiders bite pretty hard through leather.

Actually, my most fun exping in Velk's was done duoing with a paladin
in the lil corner just inside and to the right of the entrance :)
