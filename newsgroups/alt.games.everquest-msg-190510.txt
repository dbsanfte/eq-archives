Ugh, low level raids.  I tried running low level raids a while back
and I will never try again.

-Inexperienced players (some of those 15-30 level players will be on
their highest character)  This is the number one problem...
-Usually higher aggro problems than you would have on upper end raids.
-Low level dungeons = faster respawn rates (repops catch up to you)
