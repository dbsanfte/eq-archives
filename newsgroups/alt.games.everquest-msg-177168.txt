An alternative to one-size-fits-all approaches:  Know your enemy!
Knowledge is power.  For example, undead care a lot about proximity,
especially compared to most other low level (under 30) mobs, so if
you can stun an undead and step clear (around the other side of the
melee who is going to help you, don't make the tank chase you, he
may decide you're not worth the bother) you're probably golden.
Another alternative:  If mobs are snared kite them in circles
around the group, intelligent melees will immediately see what's
going on and peel the mob off you as soon as it's convenient.  But,
if you are not sowed and the mob is not snared running around will
only increase your chance of dying (as you so correctly noted).

You really should have worded that more clearly.  :)  Try this:
"If you have root and it is at all likely to stick... USE IT!"
I've channeled root with under-10 untwinked INT casters.  There
is NO level of any class that is not high enough to try to channel
root once you've got it.  As for the "likely to stick" part, root
is unlikely to stick on highly magic resistant mobs and also does
not stick well on red cons, or somewhat magic resistant even/yellow
cons.  But, since root is not particularly high agro as offensive
spells go, root can get you a crucial headstart when attempting to
flee a red con.

Yes, there'll be plenty of time to hit the Disband button after you
make your escape.
