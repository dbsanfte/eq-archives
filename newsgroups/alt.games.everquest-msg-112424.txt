I have been hearing that the next patch will have some changes to the 
Firiona Vie server:  evils will now be able to group with goods.  And 
also something about the languages being changed so people can now 
communicate with one another.

Personally I think the high elfs should not be grouping with ogres but 
oh well, what does my opinion mean -- can anybody verify these changes 
will be taking place?

I overheard this on the MARKET channel on that server.

Also, as a troll warrior at level 10 I noticed I had just 3 languages 
available to me to train in:  troll, ogre and gnoll.  Do more ever 
become available at higher levels because how do I ever communicate with 
any of the clerics that are neutral or dark elf?  Very curious and 
concerned about this.

If you are playing on the Firiona Vie server can you please post here 
what your race/alignment is and what languages you have available to you 
to train in, so I can better understand who can speak what languages.  
Previously I thought everybody was trying to learn the human language 
but apparently that is not the case.  Hmmmm.....
