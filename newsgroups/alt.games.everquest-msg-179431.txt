Ok, I can't find the spell.

I have been told many times that it is at either (or both) of the gypsy
camps (NK and Oasis). It is NOT.  Circle of Combine is there, but not Ring.
I have also checked Toxx, BB, Commons, Karana, Steamfont, Misty, Rivervale,
Surefall, and Shadowhaven.

I guess there is some person in FV that sells some druid spells but haven't
been yet.

Where to heck is it?

Also, my plan is to get the spell, port into the Valley near the Dreadlands,
then run to Front Mtns and finally to the overthere to hunt from 29 to 40
ish. Is that a good plan?  Are there monsters in the Lost Valley to worry
about? Will superior camouflage work to make the run across the zones, or
can stuff see you anyway? Will the wolf form help? Once in the Overthere, is
there like a perfect place or mob for a 29 druid to solo?

Thanks for any help - especially just finding me the spell.  I almost think
this is a bug.  At ALL other druid spell locations, if they sell the Ring,
they sell the associated Circle - EXCEPT the damn gypsies. But they too have
both Ring and Circle of Iceclad for example. Hmm?
