    Horn is one of the best weapons you'll find for offhand. Even that 15/23
droppable dagger from the Carprin event has roughly the same offhand DPS.
About the only droppable dagger I can think of with better ratio would be
the 15/20 one from the Ring of Slime, and that has a significant price tag
attached.
