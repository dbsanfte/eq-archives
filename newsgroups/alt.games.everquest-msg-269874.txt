I hope I am doing the right thing here as I don't have a great deal of 
experience on Usenet but I decided to leaved quoted the entirety of your 
excellent and thoughtful reply. Thank you so much for taking the time to 
so thoroughly go over the issues at hand. And actually, while I didn't 
mention it, your final suggestion has crossed my mind. I am in complete 
agreement with you about the Enchanter the more I think about it. I 
already have one rolled and ready to go, who just got his newbie charm 
and some nice twink gear. Likewise, I have a newbie beastlord in the 
same state. And you were on the right track regarding my Druid. He's 
only level 11 and I have been wowed by the difference in abilities he 
has compared to my cleric, playing him most recently in CB and soloing 
him there quite well. I really, really like him and did the newbie armor 
for him in a day. He's also somewhat twinked as well.

As I was standing in line returning something I don't need for Christmas 
after all for someone, I was thinking about this stuff and I was 
considering something along the lines of your last suggestion. Namely, 
moving all the gear from account 2, to my main account and twinking out 
the toons there or saving level req. gear for when they are older.

I understand what you were saying about the Druid and melee. I don't 
recall seeing any higher level druids melee ever. Then again, I don't 
often see clerics soloing but I am pretty good at it given the gear, 
spells and practice I have had at it over time. My offense, defense and 
1hb are all maxed and I do pretty good with a Hammer of Damnation, 
Hammer Pet (yes, I know it's lame but every little bit of dps helps and 
it costs next to nothing to cast), nukes, reverse damage shield, etc. 
I've pretty much got it down to a science and while I am obviously no 
where near as effective as most other classes soloing, it can be done.

So what I am saying there is, that while most druids would never melee, 
it is just my nature to want the skill maxed for those times when taking 
a few swipes with the old scimitar may come in handy. Kind of for the 
sake of completeness I guess. Although I suppose in actual practice it 
would probably rarely matter. But that's just me. I know it isn't 
something a Druid needs really, but on a toon I brought up from level 1, 
it would be maxed well before I ever had an epic.

I think you are right about the druid. I probably could pick him up 
pretty well compared to the others. I doubt the warrior would be too 
hard either. But I don't want to be guilty of being in a group and not 
playing my class effectively for any of these.

So I think I will move the gear to account one to those toons and play 
them from the ground up. It will be fun anyway. And I will learn "the 
right way" so to speak. Once the gear is moved over, I will deactive the 
second account and just let it sit. If for some reason SOE ever deletes 
the toons, oh, well. But I doubt it. I'm sure they'll be there later on.

You had an excellent point about the Enchanter. It might be sweet to 
play up to 50 or so and with that experience under my belt, decide 
whether to make the immediate jump to 67 or not.

In the end, bringing up my own warrior and beastlord would be easy to 
the levels of the toons on the second account. So perhaps in the future 
I might just opt to do a character transfer and bring the chanter and 
druid over to my main account and let the rest just go. Saving the time 
of playing through 50-65 and 50-67 might be very nice. Then again, at 
that point maybe I will just want to continue with my own toons. Either 
way, I got a bunch of nice gear for them and that's pretty cool.

Thanks again. I think your advice was quite good.
