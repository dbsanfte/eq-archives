I have a special hotkey for in group 'spam' that says 'no mana, do NOT 
pull' in french, english, spanish and german. repeats itself 3 times so 
it is hard to miss. made it up after being in a group where english was 
considered something for pool balls to make funky angles off the pads 
... we had a spanish and a belgian pair of pullers, and the mage was 
german. sort of like a nato action without the gunfire;-)Was an 
interesting session. At any given time one of the pullers would take off 
for the hinterlands to return followed by something big and angry. Since 
i have a dedicated group chat window, I tend to see the little lines 
saying /lom/ or /oom/ and will hit the hot key if a puller starts off on 
a run if we are in a multilingual group. And why it repeats multiple 
times? fills up multiple lines on a screen so they cant miss that little 
/oom/ or /lom/ phrase.
