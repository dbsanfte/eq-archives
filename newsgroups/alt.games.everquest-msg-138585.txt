One other thing I meant to mention.  A good way to work up weapon skills
is to head to an area that is high level for you, find a group with steady
pulls.  Tell them you're a wimpy shaman and ask if you can practice
weapon skills by hitting their mobs.  You'll do WAY less damage then they
will, so you won't get aggro or kill steal, but your weapon skills should
still steadily go up.

Cheers,

John
