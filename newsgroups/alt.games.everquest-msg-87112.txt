Hmmm... favourite last words...

Well "I'm fine, I still got LOH" always tickles me... and "Harmtouch is
almost NEVER resisted" is another.

The following isn't VERBATIM, but you've prolly ALL seen similar at least
once... (btw... I was the warrior and had only just joined an Orc Highway
group in Oasis)

Shadowknight "inc"
Monk "inc"
Warrior "who's puller?"
Cleric "lom"
Shadowknight "add"
Monk "oops FD" (which fails)
Enchanter has gone Linkdead
Shadowknight " 2 inc assist me"
Monk "heal me"
Cleric casts Divine Aura and runs for docks...
...SK pet eats sand fast
...Monk doesn't need to Feign death anymore
Enchanter has left the group
Cleric "SH" (note... this turns out to be 'sg' typed with one hand)
A Sand Giant reminds you of the drawback of 1st-person-perspective views
LOADING PLEASE WAIT
You have lost level 17!
Enchanter /tell "sorry about that, been lagging all nite"
