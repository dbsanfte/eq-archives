Well, the message stated:

Experience for killing NPCs will be distributed to all members of the
raid that are within range. However, the experience given will be
smaller than the experience that would be earned by a single group.
Generally, unless you are fighting NPCs that require a raid, you will
still be better off earning experience with the old fashioned six-person
group.

Raids will definitely allow for larger than traditional groups, however,
much of EverQuest is designed with the six-person group in mind. Adding  
small number of people to a given group will allow this "oversized"
group to gain experience. However, we recommend that once a "raid" of
ten or more people forms, a second, traditional group split off and
adventure on their own.

>Inquiring minds want to know!

That hints to me of the experience split becoming less beneficial over
single groups around 10 people. The important part is: Adventure on
their own.

My intuition on this is that raidgroups will have a FIXED exp modifier
of about 1/10th to 1/15th of the exp given for a mob PER PERSON. We all
know mobs have a fixed amount of exp. 

Say L52 NPC called: Orcus_Pawnus 'contains' 30,000 

A L52 kills that specific white-con mob in ECo, in a 2 man group, and
gets X% exp. The actual exp he gets is made up of:
30,000/2 = 15,000 'raw' exp
2 man group modifier
White con bonus brought in recent patch
Zone EXP modifier
Maybe some other modifier.
Then the exp he gets is translated into moving your exp bar:
<Actual exp>/<Exp for L53 - Exp for L52> * 100% = X%

Now there's also a L52 NPC called: Fungius_Shroomius in the Deep. A full
group of L60s kill it.

This mob also 'contains' 30,000 exp, by virtue of it's level. The actual
exp the group gets:

30,000/6= 5,000 'raw' exp
higher 6 man group modifier
low blue con penalty brought in recent patch
higher Zone EXP modifier
Maybe some other modifier.
Then the exp her gets is translated into moving your exp bar:
<Actual exp>/<Exp for L53 - Exp for L52> * 100% = Y%

The mob contains the same amount of 'raw' exp, determined by level. What
I think raid exp will change is to *fix* the group modifier.

GroupA would've gotten the exp on MobTrash05, containing 600,000 exp. 

CURRENT SITUATION
If GroupA has 6 members, each get 100,000 exp each (600,000/6) then
modifiers (including 6 man group bonus) are applied
If GroupA has 5 members, each get 120,000 exp each (600,000/5) then
modifiers (including lesser 5 man group bonus) are applied
If you aren't in GroupA you get nothing

THEORETICAL RAIDEXP SITUATION
I think the raidexp modifier will be around 1/15.
Everyone on the raid gets 40,000 exp each (600,000/15) then modifiers
(excluding group modifiers) are applied.

************************************************************************

SYNOPSIS:

Basically, instead of 1 group getting 2AA each on a 60 person 10 hour
clearing VT (300 blue bubbles total) everyone will get 3 yellows (900
blues). Regular group exping will still be clearly superior, but the
raid as a whole will benefit from 3 times as much exp
