I've been thinking of getting a personalized license plate that says "SOW
PLZ".
I live in BC, Canada and doubt if anyone has grabbed it yet in my province
anyways. And my car could really use a SoW now and again.  Anyone ever seen
a plate like this before.  My only reason for not doing it already is having
to explain it hundreds of times.  I think the times that I see someone
looking and laughing will be priceless though.
