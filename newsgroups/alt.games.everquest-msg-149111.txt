At first I was unsure of the new UI. I hadn't been in EQ for a long time but I 
was still used to the old one. After I got accustomed to the new UI, however, I 
just loved it. The seperate chat windows are helpful to me (I didn't know of 
/hitsmode before). Window arrangement is very handy. My favorite feature is the 
XML coding that allows percentages to be added. Now I can have a % next to my 
target's hp, % on all my group members' health, and % readings for my own hp, 
mana, and fatigue. Add to that I can now have AA exp and exp bars in my player 
info window, also each with % readings. CurrentHP/MaxHP next to my name in the 
player info window, ATK/AC, and whatever else basically.

Now, if only they'll make it so the auto-equip slot and destroy button that I 
added to my HotButton window will actually function... (they only work within the 
inventory window currently)
