I thought it would be, but surprisingly, it's not.

That's probably because modern flat-panel laptop displays
switch colors far faster than the older models.  On really
old laptops, you can actually watch the image fade away
after the screen clears, and animated objects leave
long "streaks".  Not so on the latest laptops.

In fact, EQ seems brighter, more vivid, and crisper on
the laptop than on my desktop system.  Go figure.
