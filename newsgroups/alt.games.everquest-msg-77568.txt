Ok, what you said is right, but lemme explain a little more. On Tallon Zek,
Shorts are on the purple team, Humans are blue, Darks are orange, and Elfs
are Yellow (their names are these colors). You can only attack those that
arnt your color. To kill someone you have to be 6+ and can only kill someone
8 levels higher or lower. You can only loot the coinage they have on their
body (most i ever got was 65 plat). On Tallon Zek most people go by the
Light Vs. Dark thing where you attack only what has the Orange name, but
alot of people just kill anyone. Everything the other guy said is right
though.
