ATI Radeon 9800 Pro. Same problem, only I have not been able to recover 
from it yet. 100% failure rate trying to go to windowed mode. Luckliy (sort 
of) I have that nagging Windows error reporting turned on, so I can hit 
enter to click the button (mouse doesn't work at this point either) to get 
me back to normal at the Windows desktop.
