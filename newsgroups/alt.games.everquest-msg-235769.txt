May I use Craniacs thread for another PL question?

I two box all the time in order to PL.  Account 1 has my druid account 2
has the char being PL'd. 

PLing a tank class is a piece of cake and the exp comes in fast because
the tank just keep aggroing (adding). 

My question is, is there a trick to PLing a caster or a caster with pet?
 I've done it, but the exp is much slower.
