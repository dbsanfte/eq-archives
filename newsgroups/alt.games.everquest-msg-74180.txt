  Yeah, but sometimes that doesn't quite work.  The items you're
comparing it against have to be pretty similar, because if "Item A"
can be used by, say, erudites, and "Item B" can't, that may increase
the value of "Item A" even if "Item B" is superior overall.  But
you're right, generally speaking a good way to get an idea of the
value of an item is to take two other items: one that's worse than the
one you're appraising, and one that's better.  Presuming you have a
fair idea of the going rate of these two items, you can safely assume
that the value of the item you're appraising falls somewhere in
between.
