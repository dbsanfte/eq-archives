While running through the Lake of Ill Omen zone headed for Frontier
Mountains I came acrossed a sarnak revealer and quickly dispatched him. All
he dropped was a few gold and a Farsight Crystal (Lore Item) all/all.
Anybody have any clues as to what this is for? How much it's worth?

I checked all the sites I could think of and got a big zero on info. (no
listing)

Thanks in advance.
