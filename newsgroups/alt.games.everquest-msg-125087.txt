Ahh, for playing a Shadow Knight, you just have to have the perfect
screaming, threatening, and risquï¿½ music. The kind of music that makes you
want to rip out a Drolvarg's rib cage and wear it like a vest.

My playlist: Adema, Bile, Chimaira, Coal Chamber, Disturbed, Dope, Drowning
Pool, Flaw, Godsmack, Gravity Kills, Korn (the older stuff, naturally...),
Marilyn Manson, Metallica, Mudvayne, Mushroom Head, Nine Inch Nails,
Nirvana, Powerman 5000, Prodigy, Rammstein, Sevendust, Slipknot, Soulfly,
Static-X, System of a Down, The Refreshments, and Tool.

The Refreshments' "Banditos" is great for group situations, or when you
spend time in LOIO. And of course, "Waiting to Die" by Hed P.E is just
perfect for mass-slaughter of greens.
