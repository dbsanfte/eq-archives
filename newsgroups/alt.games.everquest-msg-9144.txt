I'm standing around North Qeynos, binding and farming bat wings.

Guy runs up to me and says, "I've got something that you can kill."

Aparently a Zombie had spawned, and was making hunting difficult for the

"Can you please kill that?"

"Hmmm... Maybe." <BOOM> <breath on it> it's dead.

I loot it ... like 4 silver (wheee).

"Can I have the loot?"
