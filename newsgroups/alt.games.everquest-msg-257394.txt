Another perfect example of a situation where there's no rule, but we can 
imagine one at the drop of a hat. :)

Well, if you didn't learn it by rule, it's not necessarily a rule, is it? 
:)

I ahven't checked Strunk&white this morning, but I would be most suprised 
if they have a 'q with no u' pronunciation rule.

Similarly, I'm quite satisfied with the American education I received.  
And there is a lot good to be said about our more prestigious 
universities, for example.

But far too large a percentage of our population can't even read, much 
less post to USENET.  We can do much, much better if we as a society put 
our minds to it.
