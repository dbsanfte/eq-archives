    I'd be more than a bit peeved if that happened.  After all, if I understand
right the endurance thing is just for warriors, rogues and monks.  I wouldn't
want that extra hps I have from sta gear to suddenly go poof.  And is stamina
going completely away for these 3 classes?  I would guess that their hps would
still be based off it.  If not, what about all the melee who sank all their
bonus points at creation into sta?
