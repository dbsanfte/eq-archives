I don't think I've ever seen more than a (potential) 5 pull in LDoN
but you're right that in the crowded rooms pacify comes in REALLY
handy. IME that's usually no more than 2 rooms in any given dungeon
though.

I can't speak to the lvl 50s adventures but in the lvl 65 ones (normal
difficulty) a pet can offtank easily. There's really no way a monk or
ranger (even in horrible equipment) couldnt' do the same. It isn't a
matter of AAs or uber gear, my more Uber friends tend to be off
raiding in the evenings when we do LDoN soI tend to be the highest in
my groups with about 75 AAs. ... and we're talking mainly bazaar and
HoT gear. Normal mode is still a pretty good challenge for us. Add one
or two people with 200+ AAs and VT/Elemental gear and I'll readily
admit that it becomes trivial. 

My perspective is biased in the sense that any group I'm in will have
a slower and backup healer and I tend to get groups within a circle of
about a dozen friends which helps a lot. Not necessarily because
they're better players (which they are, if only because we've always
hunted dungeons) but after you group with people for a while you tend
to know their strengths and weaknesses and automatically compensate
for that.
