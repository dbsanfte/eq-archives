It's possible the ranger was root sniping the giant when you sent the
pet in, and by the time she chased you down, your dots had been
running long enough that you held aggro. DOTs tend to be high aggro,
especially when you have multiples stacked. That plus the melee damage
the pet had done could well have pulled more hate on the giant than
the ranger could compensate for, especially if she wasn't taunting
herself. One tip, always use your assist hotkey when pulling in areas
others are soloing nearby to make sure the mob you're pulling doesn't
already have aggro on someone else.

It's entirely possible that the ranger hadn't touched the giant before
you, though. She might be one of those asshats that considers someone
else pulling the mobs they're tracking to be KSing. =/ Either way, it
did not make rooting the giant next to you right. The second half of
the ranger's response to you tells me she did it on purpose, and a
/report of that tell with a petition would 've probably at least
gotten her a stern talking-to from a guide/GM.
