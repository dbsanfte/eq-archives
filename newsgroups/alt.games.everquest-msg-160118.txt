Hi everyone!

I am looking to find some opinions on a good wep combo to help my warrior
keep aggro.

At L53 I have a lammy (9/19) and VAB (11/24+proc 85DD), that does ok DPS,
but not good at keeping aggro.

I do also have a Felhammer (36/46+proc 83DD), and that seems to keep aggro
better, but seems too slow to be effective at times.

So what good weapon combo can should I consider to get/keep aggro and still
do decent DPS.

TIA,
