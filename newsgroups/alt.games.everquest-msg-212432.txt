My guild could easily land two 50's groups most anyplace on the map. With
the number of 40's we've got growing and a little recruiting it wont be long
before that's four 50's groups, with some people in their 60's. [me for
instance within two weeks I'd say].

We've got a 50's enchanter, one 50's cleric and another at 49, a 54 shammy
and two early 50's warriors. We also have a 58 wizzy, some rangers and
druids, a necro, a pally, etc etc all in the 50's. A couple of people are
into their epics, none are complete yet. I'm not touching mine with a barge
pole.

Dear ubers:

If you were running our guild, where would you raid first? Where can we raid
with four groups?

How many hit points do NTOV dragons have? :o) Do they hit much harder than
PoN/PoD mobs? :>

Are they slowable? Are they snare-able? How much do we need to gear-up an
early or mid 50's warrior to tank them? Has anyone ever tanked them with a
60sk? <g>
