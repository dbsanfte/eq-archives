The policy has undergone a bit of revision in the time
since I joined, and I got it a little wrong - straight
from our guild policies

--------------------
Our RPP (Raid Participation Point) system is based on 60% raid attendance 
and closed-bid RPP auctions.

You will gain RPP's for attending raids and may use your points to bid on 
items dropped at raids. These are your points to bid with however you see 
fit.

You must maintain a 60% attendance status to stay on RPP roster and remain 
eligible to bid.

You will not lose your RPP if you drop below 60% you just will not be able 
to bid until you are back to 60% attendance threshold.

There are three ways to do this:

Attend more often and get back up to 60+ per cent or...

You may "buy" attendence percentage points at the rate of 10 RPP per point 
to get it back up there. This can be done once per 6 months.

You may reset your attendence to 100% and RPP to zero once a year.

You must be at a raid for at least 2 hours for it to count towards 
attendance. If the raid is shorter than 3 hours you will be awarded 
attendance.
-----------------------
On holds (a time period in which your attendence % won't change)

-----------------------
Dear Guildies, we have elaborated a new Hold Policy, it's important for all 
of you to know it. 

You can ask for Hold for at least two weeks if you have: a RL problem, 
vacations, extended work travel, or you are a bit burned and would love to 
be "On Hold" to think if you want to continue playing this evil game.

You can NOT ask for a Hold if you have a work problem that causes that you 
can't play at nights (or some nights or weekend days or any combo), or if 
you want to play an Alt for a bit to level him up. Sorry, but we can't 
allow this, we are a raiding guild and we need that most if not all of the 
guildies attend the raids, or we will never progress enough further in to 
get our goals.

You can't ask for a Hold too often, you will be allowed to be on hold two 
times per calendar year, this will apply only for vacations and extended 
travels. Of course if you have an important RL issue we will talk about it 
and consider it.

If you are on hold and you could get your hands into a PC and want to join 
us in groups or in a raid, you will be welcomed, but you will not be 
allowed to bid (or get in random rolls) on items and neither RPP nor ATT% 
will go up for you unless that you want to get out of Hold from that raid.

If you are on hold and you start playing too frequently during the day or 
some nights, the Council will ask your reasons to still be on hold, so it 
can be evaluated if you continue or not.
---------------------------

So, you can see we provide tools to take care of a forseeable lapse
in attendence (by going on hold until RL is under control), recover
small amounts of low attendence percentage, and move from 0% to
100% attendence at the cost of your remaining RPP.
