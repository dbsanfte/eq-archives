>Jeesh, why do some people think that being annonymous on the internet gives
>them the right to say things to others that would offend in the real world?

Probably the same thing that gives every noob the chance to spout off
5 pages of ill writ diatribe and dewd speak about pointless things
without lurking for a day or two and seeing which way the wind blows.

Because they CAN.  Welcome to Usenet, there arent a whole lot of rules
unless you start threatening physical violence, and if you do that I
believe you'll find many layers of anonymity arent as foolproof as you
may have once hoped. 

I find your comment hugely hilarious on another level tho...  Pot and
Kettle and all that.  Personally, I think Usenet anonymity for daily
use is pretty lame, but thats just me.
