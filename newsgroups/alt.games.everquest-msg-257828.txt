This was common with random driver versions when I was running an Nvidia
card in EQ. Look for the 2xS fsaa setting to minimize it, and when you
find a driver release that doesn't blur the text in your chat box save a
copy and don't upgrade unless forced to. I have no clue why they manage
to flip back and forth between text being unaffected and blurry between
different driver versions but it was common from the 3.x version on for
me on my 4200.
