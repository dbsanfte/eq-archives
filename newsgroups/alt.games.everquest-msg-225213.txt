English is one of the worst languages I'm familiar with, loaded up with 
terrible constructs like this one, which is great if you like puns or 
complexity in your poetry, but awful if you are trying to teach your 
three year old to read.

"Just because" should never be a reason.

A female pig is called a sow, which is pronounced like how or now or cow.

To plant seeds is to sow, which is pronounced like low or know or 
show... or as mentioned in this thread most often, like sew, to tailor 
cloth with a needle and thread.

There are other words like this; bow (to bend at the waist as a show of 
respect, or the front of a ship) is pronounced like how, while the same 
spelling meaning the archery weapon is pronounced like sew.

Then there's Live (like give) and Live (like hive), and lots more.

Stupid ass language, full of letters with multiple pronunciations, 
sounds with multiple letters that make that sound, and assorted nonsense.

Makes me want to teach my kids in spanish, which is at least 90% more 
sensible... and spoken by more people in the world!
