I just found some wild blueberries but there are no recipe that can
use it.  Why not?  What's wrong with: Wild Blueberries, Clump of
Dough, and Pie Tin to make a blueberry pie?

I also noticed that there are a few broken recipes listed in EQ
universe that can never be used.  For example: Fizzle pop (not to be
confused with fizzlepop without the space)  It required:
    * bottle(2)
    * berries
    * sylvan berries
    * aerated mineral water

Aerated mineral water doesn't exists so why is there recipes that uses
nmonexistient item still in the game?
