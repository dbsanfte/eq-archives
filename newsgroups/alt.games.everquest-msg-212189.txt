It won't be too far off full stats at 53rd.He may loose a point or two in
damage but it will still be a flipped ratio even then. (hell its a decent 2
hander even in my twinky 35 warrior)
And he's not likely to be 53rd forever so its a good forward looking choice.
Hell the way levels come in this day and age the character being debated is
probably already above the recomended level.

Most of swiftwind can be done nowadays with one group and the sphere from
sky can be MQ'd still even discounting that then your dual wield set up
falls even further behind becuase you won't be getting the haste or atk
modifiers.

heheh point ;)

But what I was refering too where issues of Damage bonus's and how the
different types of weapons are used. Two handers are in general out
performing dual wield in PoP this is well known. And has been since about a
month after release when people noticed that windblades were ranger usable.

Weapon stat itself is probably like 48 49dmg 44dly
Tis been a while since I was 53rd so I don't know what the damage bonus at
that level is but its still decent enough.
And once again this is a weapon that the character in question will grow
into.

I don't raid much because I tend to play in Bursts I play real sersious for
3 or 4 months and then I take 3 or 4 months off. /shrug just ain't been
lucky enough to see a weapon like your talking about drop and rot I suppose.

Mobs sometimes turn, plus there the fact that the high ratio 2 handers do
more dps.

Happened often enough that its important to tke into consideration. Warrior
takes a dirt nap someone has to pinch tank. And a two hander can make the
difference between survival and a whipe. Even in raids mobs get cornered and
when an enrage message is missed it a 2 hander can make the difference
between a ranger tearing himself apart with fast dual wield set ups or
surviving.
Tank goes link dead or has to go to work and no replacement tank is
available sure its less mana efficient for a ranger to tank but slow xp is
better than no xp.

What ever, I've tanked at every level of play. Even at 65th pop I've even
pinch tanked in BoT so being prepared for that eventuality is hardly
"stupid"
Basically the only way your going to out damage a windblade all other things
being equal (haste) is if you have one of those high end no drop 1 handers
(I'm talking ahb and similar) and have dropped the 9 points into
ambidexterity. Even then if you were to spend those points on Punishing
blade it would probably be back at a tos up.

A windblade remains a nice weapon for a ranger arsenal. Even if a 53rd
ranger isn't getting full benifit out of it he'll eventually grow into it.
Heck everything you say that is an advantage to me at 65 weilding the damn
thing applies to 1 handers as well. Better damage bonus higher atk and
higher damage tables.
I didn't mention my parsing to illustrate absolute numbers (I've done enough
parsing to know the futility in that idea) but to show relative str of
different weapons choices. Windworn handblade was pretty close to a
windblade I'll admit but not close enough to justify the price premium nor
the other disadvantages. Disembowler is decidedly inferior. and the other
droppable options are even worse.
Now I have to admit I'm surprised at the low dps for the ranger that this
argument started based on. I about half suspect he wasn't maxed with 2hs
which would explain his lower than expected dps. Though it could be related
to haste as well.
However I still maintain that a windblade is an excellent ranger weapon. All
of its advantages apply to us as far as tanking advantages though to a
lesser degree than plate tanks.
Still considering that it does better than dual wield dps and has those
tanking advantages makes it worth its weight in plats.
