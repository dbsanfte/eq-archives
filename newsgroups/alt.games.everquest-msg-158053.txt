No apology necessary, I'm an old enough hand to understand how difficult it
can be to get the real picture in Usenet.  Any misunderstanding was likely
the fault of my poor analogies, not yours at all.  Besides, you WERE right,
I SHOULD feel happy for them.

Well, I never demanded payment for ports, either I would or I wouldn't.
Even the one time I actually TRIED to raise money porting, I would still
port for free, I just told them to "pay me what you feel it's worth".  That,
of course, was a catastrophic waste of time as far as raising money was
concerned.  After three days, I never did it again.  I could never bring
myself to DEMAND money for a port.

Solo, I would sometimes port.  I never ported ANYONE while grouped.  Unlike
you (and the wizzise, with their TL), porting required not only the
expenditure of my mana, but my ABSENCE at least long enough for two zonings.
I'm sorry, but while grouping that's tantamount to desertion.  That's like
them yelling for the evac and finding out I already gated.  If something had
happened while I had been gone, I would never have forgiven myself; I'm the
Evacer, I am to be there to get everyone out when the group leader says so.
If I fail, I die with the group.  This is NON-negotiable.

Yes, well...  I'm level 44.  58 is a LONG way away, and my play is sporadic,
so I may never get there at all.  Lets face it, a Level 58 spell is not much
help to the class, it's only a help to those that have already made it to
the top, or very close to it.  Those trying to GET there aren't helped at
all, it just gives them something to drool over.

Well, harmony had its problems as well.  It was usable only in outdoor zones
(where XP is usually the lowest), some mobs were immune, and despite what
people said it didn't always work.  It had a VERY short casting range, and
gave you no warning if you were OUT of range.  A mob with a wide aggro range
couldn't be harmonied, since he would attack you before you could get close
enough to cast the spell, and if you were too cautious about getting close
to cast it, then it didn't work and you didn't know it.

It was far from the uber spell it's been made out to be, but something about
it became inconvenient to what they wanted to do in the POP, so now we don't
have it any more.  <sigh>

I understand that they MUST make changes, but they need to put some work
into giving the classes something BACK when they make a major nerf to long
established abilities.

We ARE still good at solo, and this is what everyone points to when
discussions of class balance come into play, but we then turn around and get
derided and insulted for PLAYING solo.  At my level, the big things I had to
offer a group were Ensnare (still an excellent spell), and the ability to
stretch to cover most missing abilities from a group.  Root is a good
emergency "Mez", we can do some emergency healing but my experience as of
6-7 months ago was we just didn't have the mana efficiency to be the main
healer in a full group, we're good pullers if you don't have a monk or a
Ranger, and some of our buffs are decent in the area of regeneration, AC &
HP, and resists.  Our problem is that we can't do ALL of this.  Just because
we have the spells available doesn't mean we have the mana to do it all.  In
addition, since our spells are less mana efficient, we have a harder time
filling ONE of those roles, much less stretching to cover two or three.

Oh, and Melee is right out.  Not a chance at level 44.

A grouping Druid needs to carefully pick his memorized spells after he
discovers what  classes are going to be in the group.  Each grouping needs
to be carefully tailored, something others don't understand.  I have a hard
time getting answers when I ask who is going to be there, and what each one
is going to do.  They think we should just throw up our best spells and "go
to it", but that will get you killed quickly.  It's VERY important for a
druid to plan.

Ah well, as Davian told me in a /t last night, I came in after a VERY long
absence and posted some fairly strong ideas that go against "conventional
wisdom".  I guess I need to back off a bit and let people get to know me
again...
