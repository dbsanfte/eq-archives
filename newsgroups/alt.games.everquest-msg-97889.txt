I heard that he was giving out armour for Sarnak Blood but this wasn't
confirmed and, as you experienced, once attacked he became unresponsive
(although I did enjoy his AoE knock back) and after that it became a few
people trying to roleplay and a lot, pissing around. 200 plus in the zone,
eventually.

I'd rather the GM's put approprait NPC's in zones, Tunare in Gfay (think
this was done and she got attacked, tho) Inny in Nektolus etc and made any
one attacking him/her/it KoS to factions of that area (adding some high 40's
Newbie Guards to enforce this faction will keep anyone that wants a fight
happy (or at least occupied)

Doubt this would happen but if it did it might help the chances of the
Event.
