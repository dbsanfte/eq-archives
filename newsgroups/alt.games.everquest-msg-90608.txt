I was thinking the same thing about the Shadows in Twilight.  I don't know
if you've ever encountered the horrid shadow, but that sucker is a
lifetapping nightmare!  It took me 4 attempts to finally solo him by
changing tactics.  If he wasn't getting the HP back from the lifetaps, then
he is going to be even worse for the next guy.  All he dropped was the Mark
of Horror for Twilight Armor which is pretty much not worth the effort
(stats, AC, faction involved in even starting these.)
