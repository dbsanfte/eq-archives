    If you look at some of the old Crucible bar charts that showed number of
hits at a given damage, you'd see that's exactly the case. STR increases
allow for harder hits, but don't change the accuracy.

    Back in Beta, ATK was split into two components, named something like
Accuracy and Damage. They were combined into one number around the same time
that AC was combined into one number.
