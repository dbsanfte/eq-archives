That's what I thought too, but someone made some good points that
caused me to reconsider.

Verant *could* make a Win95 server, technologically frozen at a
pre-SoL level. Those users would never get another patch, never get
new goodies, new quests, etc., but their game would continue to work.
Name the server "Moribund", just for fun.

There would of course be some infrastructure hurdles, such as a front
end that didn't bother with patching, and a separate login server, but
once all that was set up, they could basically ignore the system.


Now, just because they could do it doesn't mean I think they should -
I'd much rather they focussed on improving the game.

Which in a way is an oddly pleasant thought. Usually it's the Suits
who make some dumb decision, leaving the programmers to scramble. It's
nice to see that it might be the other way around once in awhile :)
