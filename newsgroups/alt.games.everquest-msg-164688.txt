19th century imperialism - government sponsored companies go to third
world countries, take their natural resources and raw materials so
they can be processed at home or in factories owned by the imperialist
nation. The only lasting benefit to the locals is the temporary jobs
it provides while the raw materials are cost effective to gather. Some
countries were better about this than others (UK fairly good compared
to, say, Belgium or Portugal), and did provide some lasting benefits.
Environmental and humanitarian concerns were often, though not always,
ignored (at least by that century's standards).

20th century imperialism - companies completely out of control of the
government (but with its tacit approval) go to third world countries,
take their natural resources and raw materials so they can be
processed at home or in factories owned by the imperialist company.
The only lasting benefits to the locals is the temprorary jobs it
provides while the raw materials are cost effective to gather. There
is no example of a company staying past its profit line, and
environmental and humanitarian concerns are almost always completely
ignored.

I think they know what imperialism means just fine. And the US is by
far the biggest exporters of it these days.
