Rastus butchered the english badly in <at least> the following ways:

"...halfway to the second stars..."
"...until I started some tried..."
"...high stength spell..."

Hmmn - looks like it's time to break out the spellchecker or do something
equally rash... like proof read or something.

In my defence I have recently had my anti-depressant dosage doubled and now
spend my entire working day under the direct supervison of Prince Valium....
ahh - sweet insanity... : )

Of course on the postive side at the moment I could have both my legs broken
and be stuck and the bottom of an abandoned mine shaft but still be having a
wonderful time, complete with idiotic grin (let's just politely ignore the
drool though ok?) It helps my work performance markedly.......

Really, Really Big   ^__^
