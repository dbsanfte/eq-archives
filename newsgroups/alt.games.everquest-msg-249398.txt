They are all old school rangers, that long ago had all the "good" AAs.  But
MGB just seems to rank only slightly higher than innate lung capacity for
actual usefulness.  Their spells aren't expensive, there are generally
several at a raid to share the duty, and they have nothing else to use their
mana on anyway.   =)

While they may be at the bottom of the list of soloers...  I say again, care
to guess how many AAs I can get soloing with my monk in an hour?  4 hours? 
8 hours?  A week...  =)
