Let me guess... Gardner borrowed it? :)

Thank you for the reading list, definitely.  I think I have several of 
those tucked away in my (alas very distant) library.  I might very much 
need a "Tarot for Dummies" first, though. :)

Interesting.  Looks like we agree on a lot, except it would be nice if all 
the times he said, "learn more!" it was actually linked somehow to more 
information.  But hey.
