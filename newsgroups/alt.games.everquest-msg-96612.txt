My druid is level 26.  I always cast snare first, followed by fear.
If I need  it, I'll use ensnaring roots.  For most mobs, I'd rather
fear kite them then ensnare them.

If it's a mob that can't be feared off, then I'll use ensnaring root
and safely nuke from a distance using a DoT followed by same patient
boosts from a DD spell.
