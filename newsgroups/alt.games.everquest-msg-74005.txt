Any comments on lower level (12) pal weapon choice.  I have good 2hs
but looking for good 1hs - using a bastard sword as my 1hs weapon at
this time.  But fighting in BB would really like to do the bigger
damage (8/39 isn't cutting it)  but want to keep my 1hs skill
progressing along with bash.  I'm working out of Qeynos and solo alot
so if any suggestions on where to go or quest to try in the area
please let me know.  Don't want to go on long corpse runs.
