Absolutely.  Trials are single group, and anyone who can get over level 60
can do them.  (You can try pre-60, but you're unlikely to succeed unless
your group is uber enough that the other 5 dont' really need you there.)

Farm the rares, for sure.  Unless you have a *lot* of friends beyond what
you've listed.

I've seen Grummus wipe out a 60 person raid with an average level of 62.
Repeatedly.

You can do the maze event, but that just gets you Plane of Nightmare B.
Killing Terris Thule will take many more people than you listed. I haven't
gotten a chance to try her yet, but I'd be suprised if she was much easier
than Grummus.
