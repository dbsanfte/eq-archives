When in doubt...

When you do anything that may temporarily alter your faction standings
(wolf form, skeletal form, werewolf form, etc. etc.), it's always a
good idea to stand back from any NPC you haven't yet been near
in wolf (or whatever) form, and /con them.  That'll tell you their
current attitude towards you in your current form.  You'll be safe
if they neither "scowl" nor "glare" at you.

Over time you'll learn who/what/where is safe in wolf form, without
having to rely on someone else's potentially incomplete guide.
