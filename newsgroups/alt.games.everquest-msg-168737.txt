I find Kelethin easier, being based out of Ak'Anon still.  Pop up to PoK,
down to Kelethin, and run over to the appropriate vendor.  Less zoning that
way.  There is a boot vendor in Kelethin, but I have not checked on the
sandals there yet, I did get all the other cloth armor that I cannot wear
but will need for the quest armor in Kelethin.  You would think that gnome
quest armor would start with the small variants of these armors, but
noooooooo, have to get the stupid human sized stuff.  I was hoping to at
least wear the cloth armor until I upgraded each piece.
