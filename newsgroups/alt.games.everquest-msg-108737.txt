Does it have problems with graphics at all?
I've got the ATI All-in-Wonder and it had problems with the 2D graphics
(trees and rugs in buildings, things like that, character names, NPC names)
would be grayscale and flicker shades of gray as you moved closer to them.
They would also show up through (in front of) everything else.  A tree
behind a hill or building would look normal for everything except the leaves
would appear as if they shown through the building.  Playing an Ogre was
near impossible due to this.

I'm building a new system in a few months, I'd like to put the ATI Radeon
All-in-wonder in it (for video capture mainly).  I'll see then how XP and it
work for EQ.  Until then I'm considering another card in this system
(All-in-wonder Radeon only supported by XP, not 98SE?).

I've considered a Geforce4 MX400? How do they work for EQ?
