Which supports my point, not yours.  MtG was highly influential, and the 
world of games would be poorer without it and the many gams influenced 
by it, including games with non-collectable cards.  People who wanted to 
play other card games (with or without money) just carried right on, 
without trying to destroy MtG before it even got started.

Irrelevant here - we are talking about games in which the rules permit 
payment.

But what you see is in your head, not in the real world. 

And nobody is going to be chained to their computer and forced to play a 
particular game.

Whether it stinks is a matter of opinion.  Whether most people don't 
want it will be decided in the marketplace.  And the bit about whether 
it is inevitable is, presumably, just a rallying call to panic half-wits 
into 'acting now, before They take control of your computer'.
