You can lose all you gear due to Bugs but that is rare now.
Used to happen a lot when EQ was first started.

You can also lose all your gear by letting your corpse rot.
Almost happened to me I died and 'thought' I had camped
out. I came back after about 20 hours. Close call.

You can also give all you equipment away and quit EQ only
to come back later and want to play again.

You can also sell all the gear on one character to finance
gear on a new character only to come back to that character
after a while.
