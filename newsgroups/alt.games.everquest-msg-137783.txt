    For anything without an AoE, ressing folks back in works. Even slowed by
res effects, Joe Melee is still contributing damage. He may not live long if
he catches aggro, but hopefully he won't get aggro in the first place.

    Speaking of aggro - cycling main tanks is pretty commonplace when first
doing an encounter. MT 1 dies, res him back while MT 2, MT 3 etc. take over.
By the time the last MT dies, MT 1 is fully healed, rebuffed with at least
the HP-giving buffs and haste, and depending on length of the fight might
even have Evasive or Defensive back. You therefore need fewer main tanks -
you recycle the ones you have.

    You end up losing levels because of all the deaths. It's an in-joke in
my guild that the members of one high-end guild always go /role because they
want to hide the fact that most of them have lost 60. And it's amazing -
when I see a group of them I /con them, and half are blue to me. They've
gotten better since the old days, but still.

    Cleric resses, casts CH. Shaman clicks on velious BP and casts RH.
Enchanter clicks on epic and casts SoS. Welcome back to the fight, for 400
mana and three total clicks. You'll be fighting at regular speed or so for a
little bit, then hasted normally. Your HPs will be down maybe 1500 or so
from normal. You're far from gimped. Casters, agreed. They're gimped when
they come back.

    Most end-game mobs are glued to whoever is taunting and tanking the hell
out of them. If the mob has an AoE, battle ressing won't work well. If it
does not, battle ressing will work rather well. The idea isn't to kill 50
people, then send them all back in at once. You send in 50, and as attrition
starts to happen you bring them back while the people still there keep doing
their jobs.

    If someone casting res is higher on the hate list than any of the
players banging away on the mob you have bigger problems than just zerging.

    That blue-con guild just did Cursed yesterday. They wiped first time,
and while someone kited him they ressed, rebuffed, re-engaged and won. I can
remember us wiping to AoW, then getting ressed and rebuffed before he
depopped and killing him the second attempt. It happens more than you know.
