Hmmm would this program by any chance store keystrokes for things like..I
don't know..say...Usernames and Passwords?
No need to answer that.

The funny thing is that the people who would risk this are those that have
f*** all, haven't played long and who's accounts would be worth nothing, all
you'll get is a free couple of days to grief before the account is barred by
request of original owner.

Nice try
