If it does conserve mana this would be much more useful than I thought!

There are still to reasons which make me dubious about it though:

1. Many people have been insisting that the summoned necklace conserves 
mana rather than it giving a chance to conserve a reagent, but I haven't 
seen this conserving mana in using it.

2. The dictionary definition of "abate" (because "abatement" is the 
focus effect listed on the earring) is:

 From Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913) [web1913]:

   Abate \A*bate"\ ([.a]*b[=a]t"), v. i. [See {Abate}, v. t.]
      1. To decrease, or become less in strength or violence; as,
         pain abates, a storm abates.

               The fury of Glengarry . . . rapidly abated.
                                                     --Macaulay.

      2. To be defeated, or come to naught; to fall through; to
         fail; as, a writ abates.


This suggests it has more to do with reducing agro.

Have there been any tests done to determine exactly what it does?
