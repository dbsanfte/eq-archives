Not nearly as good as either seb or hs but you have at least a fair
chance at a piokup group in Maiden's Eye, and a below fair but
possible chance in Fungus Grove if you want to go through the bother
of getting there.

But note ME is an outdoor zone which means its boring as hell and
really easy for everyone but the puller, and FG can be BYOG hell
sometimes. You're better off with Sebilis if you're by yourself.

There's always open raid type situations in Kael you could get in on,
those can be fun.
