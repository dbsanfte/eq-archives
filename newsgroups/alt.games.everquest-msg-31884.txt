Put points only into skills you are about to start using.

Why?  Because when you put a point into a skill, that buys it at your
current character level.

Mages, for example, can buy Research at level 15 or so.  Yet they
have no real use for it until level 24.  If they buy it at level 15, they
need to slog thru an extra 9 skill increases that they could have
had for free.

Similarly, most newbie characters can't afford to buy bandages
for several levels.  Waiting until you -can- buy a few stacks,
before you plunk a point into the skill, will essentially give you
four or five free skill levels for that first point.
