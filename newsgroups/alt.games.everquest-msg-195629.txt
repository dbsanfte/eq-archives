Ok, so I'm having the most miserable time for about the last month with
this, time to beg for advice.

My system:
1GB 233Mhz DDR ram
Athlon 1600+
Soyo Dragon Plus! SY-K7V motherboard
Gainward Geforce3 Ti550 (which means Ti500 chip, they're just weird) 64Mb
 -- Detonator 40.81 drivers, DirectX 8.1
W2K Pro (upgraded from Win98, but problems persisted)
SBC Yahoo! DSL
I run EQW a lot.  Sometimes two sessions from installs in 2 different
directories.  But I crash when I'm running just one, just as much.
No router.  DSL plugged straight into the computer.

The problem:
Frequently, and for no clear reason, I simply crash to desktop.  Sometimes
it's when I've used a trader, sometimes right after I zone.  Not during
the zone, I actually see the new zone for 2-3 seconds.  Sometimes it's
right after I log in from clearing the last @#$%! 1018.  Frequently, of
course, it's right after I engage a mob that can kill me. :(

It seems to go in spates... I'll be fine for 6 hours, then spend 4 hours
doing nothing but waiting on 1018s.

Things I've tried:
* Upgrading to W2K pro.  Had high hopes for that one. :(
* Changing to various combinations of video drivers and versions of Dx.
* Running it without EQW.  Just as bad if not worse. :(
* Switching what kind of network card I run the DSL through.  Tried the
  onboard one, a Netgear one, and a DLink one.
* Getting a shielded phone line for the DSL.
* Taking out Zonealarm.  Feels risky, but... Well, it doesn't seem to have
  helped either. :( But it's the only other thing running besides OS stuff
  and ISP stuff...
* Reinstalling the dang ISP software eleventy-seven bajillion times.
* Running thorough file check twelvety-eight bajillion times.
* Turning off Texture Cacheing.
* Fresh installs of EQ.  Kinda went with the upgrade to W2K.
* Noticing that Win2K insists that my network card, graphics card, and
  sound all share IRQ11 and won't stop even if I deliberately try to force
  the NIC to be IRQ 10 in the CMOS.
* Online live EQ tech support.  Ha!  They had me email them some files,
  then haven't gotten back to me after a week and a half.
* Making sure windows messaging service is good and thoroughly disabled.
* Running AdAware lots.  Noticed it stopped finding stuff after I switched
  to Netscape 7 and set preferences about what cookies to take.
* Taking out half the Yahoo! crap my ISPs installer put in.  No, I don't
  need another messaging service, customized browser, extra stupid toolbar
  in all my folders, parental controls, blah blah.
* Disabling sound entirely.
* Re-enabling the onboard sound when that didn't seem to help.

So come on, what am I overlooking here?  The thing I've just noticed and
can't quite suss is that the ISP software seems to want two sets of
drivers running on my network card at the same time.  Does anyone else's
DSL do that?  What I mean is, when I look in Start--> Settings--> Network
and Dialup, I see 2 'Local Area Connection' icons.  But disabling either
one makes windows whine like a baby and things not run.  One seems to be
the NIC itself, the other seems to be some part of the DSL software.

There's no way this should be this hard. :(
