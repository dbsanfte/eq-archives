The runes do drop off mobs you kill, you might try changing
zones as some runes seem to be more common in some
zones than in others.

You could also look into trading pages and words for runes,
or get into a guild with a research bank, where all the players
dump all their research stuff into a common pool... 95% of
all research parts are destroyed because the person or group
that got them don't have someone who needs them, and they
take up valuable loot space.

Max out your skill before trying a combine if you want your best
odds.

This is true of many sorts of loot, get used to it.  On the other hand,
you may find changing zones or changing mobs helps.

You should spend practice points on research till its maxed out, and
every time you level dump all your points in to keep it maxed.  Practicing
research is a fools game, the practice rune parts are just as annoying
to get as the real parts, and as you note below, you can try again and
again and again and get very few skill ups.

Practice research is the worst waste of time, I can't believe they
put this in the game in such a poorly planned way.  For a wizard,
I suppose it could be a viable plan... but without ports its just
never going to be worthwhile

Nope, like any other skill, you are merely meant to have a chance at
increasing skill.  Sucks, eh?

Well thats bad luck, I'd have expected it to go up about one point.
Would still be far too much effort expended, especially since you
have the points free each level to raise skill 5 points... which is how
fast the cap goes up!

If the runes are trivial you will not gain skill.

Find a level 60 character with the research skill maxed out, and
pay him to do the combine for you.  Even this is only 95% effective.
If you are paranoid, group with him, this way you get a message
saying whether he successfully combined or not.

The skill caps at 200 I think.  This is best possible odds.  Still 5% fail
rate even on the very easiest attempt.

>

Yes, skill relative to what you are trying to create matters, for good
odds you want the skill to be at least at cap for the level of the
scroll you are working on... which I think is 5* level or 5*level+5

You will have about a 5% chance of success, just as a "research maxed
out" character would have a 5% chance of failure.  For a decent
chance at success your skill should be as high as a level 50 character
with maxed research, to work on a 50 research combine.

If you create it by some lucky fluke, you still won't be able to mem
it till 50.

You should get most of the research only spells, but honestly you
might look into just buying them off other characters who did enjoy
working on research.
