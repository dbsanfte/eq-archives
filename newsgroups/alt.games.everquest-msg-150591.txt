Druids have SOW and fast casting single target snare, at level
14 and up they can practice getting 4 mobs snared at the same
time and running around in a tight pack without taking any damage.
Unlike a wizard, its a simple matter for them to outrun mobs,
what they need snare for is slow mobs down enough that
when they stop to nuke, the mobs can't reach then in the
interval between "in range" and "nuke goes off"

Single target snare is more mana efficient than AE snare,
except for the rare occaision (very rare occaision) where all
four of your desired mobs happen to be standing very close
to each other when you start out.  With single target, the
fact that you are often running around trailing one, two,
or three mobs looking for a fourth isn't really a factor.
Single target snare also means you don't have to worry
about hitting normally non-aggro mobs who happen to
cross paths with your target just as the spell goes off.

By the time druids realistically can quad kite, they've
even gotten a snare upgrade that beats yours all hollow
for quadding purposes.  Quadding takes significantly
longer than single target killing.  Ensnare lasts a full
9 minutes, instead of the relatively short duration of
wizard snares (and the level one druid snare)... rare is
the quad pack that outlasts a single application of
Ensnare.  If one or two happen to outlast it, though,
the druid has SOW (or puppy or some other run
enhancer) on anyway.

I can't think of a single druid who's ever had a nice
thing to say about their 58 AE snare, most seem
to feel its a waste of a perfectly good spell slot
that could have been something useful, say a
fast casting heal for example.
