Sure, except that somebody else will already be there. You see, if its
the 'easiest best most profitable farming' and somebody knows about
it, then someone will be there, which makes it the biggest waste of
your time, unless you put a lot of value in watching someone else farm
the 'best farming'.

You'd probably have more fun just playing the game, do some ldon and
rack up some cash and aa or levels. You'll be way farther ahead then
if you tried to farm some heavily contested crap  for the same 20
hours.

cheers,
