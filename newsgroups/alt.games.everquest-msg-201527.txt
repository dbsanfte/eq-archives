I want a graveyard in Dragon Necropolis! Or at least get rid of those
roaming gating rats. I'd really like to be able to head into the
tunnels without having summon corpse on call. The zone is too hard to
get to.

Nerfed the old ones into uselessness (for a high end shaman at least)
then let the players chase a new set of shiny toys that they MAYBE
won't nerf in the future? Be still my beating heart. For Shaman, high
end DoTs will pretty much be useless unless they fix the agro issues
on the poison line. Nice for Druids I think, dunno about necros.

They already started with some of them, getting rid of worthless
shaman spectral turnins and giving us a group haste.  A nice set of
changes so far, hope it continues. I know every class has really
annoying spell issues.
