I really don't think this is over the top. It should stop a lot of the
"where is the bank" type shouts, from new players. (and old players
new to the zone). It is also a sales tool to encourage people to buy
LoY if they want maps for all zones.

Common in many games. Sorely lacking in EQ, until now.

>- Improved Help Information - The in game help files have been improved.

Again not over the top. In the past people were sent to spoiler sites,
or had to rely on the kindness of strangers to explain basic game
mechanics. 

>- All New Characters now start with a weapon skill - a skill of 5 in their primary weapon

Is this really over the top? For a level 1 the difference will be
huge, but once you hit level 2 (5 kills?) it won't matter much at all.

>- Taunt no longer requires training - Taunt now works without <being> trained.

I have always felt that this was a bug. It has never been "common
knowledge". Newbies had to learn by word of mouth. I am willing to bet
there are still characters in their 20s+ that never trained the skill
to get it jump started.

>- Packet Loss Meter is now Off by default 

I have no opinion on this....OK I do....They should have just changed
it to show green/yellow/red. The numbers really don't matter even when
you know what they mean. 

>- New Message to prompt new players about the Help button 

Annoying more than anything else, but hardly over the top.
