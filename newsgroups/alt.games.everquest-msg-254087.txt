I've been very happy with dropping them into intimidation, which seems 
nearly impossible to raise any other way; at any rate mine went up on 
the order of 5 points in 14 levels of continuous use, and has only 
really started seeing "normal" advancement (5 points in a couple hours) 
since it topped 100.

My mage, as you suggest above, used almost all his points for research, 
capped the skill out without ever having earned a single point. 
Research components are too rare and valuable to blow on skill up 
attempts, or for any purpose but actually trying to make a given spell. 
  The practice research thing was a nice idea, but its components were 
just as annoying to get ahold of and yeilded nothing of any use.  But 
the cap goes up 5 points per level and you get 5 points per level you 
have no use for... seemed a perfect match.
