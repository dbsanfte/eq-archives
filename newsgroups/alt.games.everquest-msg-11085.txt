Overwrite as in just while the proc lasts or wipe out the buff haste so
that when proc wears off you have none?  I was playing my li'l gnome
warrior last night and he was using his IBC along with shaman Alacrity
just fine, both spell icons were there and shaman haste still there when
proc dropped.  Or is it different in this case due to different spell
icons.  Haste is only part of the IBC proc and the icon is an arm rather
than a boot like Alacrity if that matters.  Dang guy was so fast even
before the proc it was hard to tell but he seemed to speed up when proc
went off.
