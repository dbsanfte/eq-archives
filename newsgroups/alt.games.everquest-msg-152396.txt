After looking at what was posted in the two short threads on
boosting the value of higher level Warriors, in particular
the comments made by our two "resident" Warlords, I'm wondering
what useful ideas we might be able to come up with as a group.

What I hear and observe is that the "problem" with Warriors is
that they're purely a one-trick pony at the high end, with very
little versatility and consequently little value to a raiding
force once you've got enough to handle MT duties for the
raid (often only one or two Warriors "needed").

Davian disliked my suggestion of a new offensive disc for the
Warrior, because it would conflict with the use of Defensive,
suggesting that it would be more useful as an AA ability.
Ben Wilson opined in the other thread that "exp-reliant end
game gimmicks, especially ones on timers" were insufficent.
I'm not so sure of this myself.  First, I've not heard anybody
question the value of Defensive (a "gimmick" on a timer), and
second the timer restriction is a powerful tool for tuning a
special ability so as not to tilt the table as far to the
Warrior's advantage as it seems to be to the Monk's advantage
the way things are now.

The one role where the Warrior is superior to all others is
secure (unless VI does something really stupid with the Knights
or Monks).  But MT'ing for raids is a pretty small box to try
to jam every Warrior in the game into.  It seems to me that
improving the utility of Warriors without treading too heavily
on the toes of the other melees could best be accomplished by
some sort of limited boost to their offensive abilities.  IMO,
the ideal result would allow the Warrior to occasionally
generate a lot more damage, but not so much sustained damage
that Monks/Rogues become superfluous, and, since hate/agro scales
with damage and hit frequency, not so frequently the Knights'
role as off-tankers is compromised unless you bring a whole
mess of Warriors to the dance.

So, the best idea I've come up with so far is a disc along the
lines of the one I proposed in the "Here's an idea" thread,
with the basic disc achieved at L50 or L51 and then improved
by some class specific AA enhancements to scale it into the
realm of the "ubers" at very high level.

Anybody have any other thoughts (or even flames) on this?
