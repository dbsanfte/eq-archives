****Thread drift*********

OK, why would people want to zone left, other than just being obsinate
or british?  I think it's pretty well established that the *majority*
of the world drives right, and in places where you drive right you
generally walk/run/bike/stroll/whatever right too.  Wouldn't it make
sense to do the same in game?  I know that the UK, Australia, NZ,
Japan, and some caribbean nations drive on the left, but that's more
of an historical artifact at this point, and I don't see EQ
development or player bases centered in any of those countries.
On Innoruuk at least, any dungeon with two zones is alwasy train
right, rez left, and it works well.  We've had this discussion before,
but I have never seen a reason to train left.  Maybe I'm missing my
secret decoder ring, or is it just the Brits trying to regain the
glory of their lost empire.

just teasing, don't throw crumpets!
