Unfortunately, I do believe it. If Verant is too lazy to fix a flaw that is
so apparent and that weakens pet classes, I don't see any reason why others
can't use it as well.

I understand that pathing is complicated, and such, but to setup something
poorly and not have any intention to fix it, even though it harms certain
classes and people is just ridiculous. Maybe since people are taking
advantage of it, Verant will make some sort of effort to either fix the
problem, or at least make it less problematic.

Frankly, I don't really care if people want to power-game through EQ. They
do it all the time, and they won't be stopped. You seem to enjoy the game
very much... so why let a few people ruin your experience? If you don't like
this sort of 'exploit' don't group with the people involved.
