  Yeah, I had the same problems with my AWE64.  I switched to a Turtle Beach
Montego A3Dxstream and some of the issues went away, but others stayed. :\

  Yeah, I think it's ridiculous too.  The bottom line is, if they're that
paranoid about people modifying their client application, they're placing
too much "trust" in the client in the first place... for a determined
hacker/cracker (or whatever you want to call them), I'd imagine a simple
measure like preventing alt-tabbing would overall be a pretty trivial thing
for them to bypass.  Evidently I'm right, since all those programs like
ShowEQ and EQMacros were released.

  But I thank you for your advice.  We shouldn't HAVE to tune our PCs to
this degree to let them run around EQ, but I guess that's just the way it
has to be.
