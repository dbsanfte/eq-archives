I must say it is usually more enjoyable when I'm part of a group that
doesn't get all worked up on looting, loot order, etc.  Those groups are
either more into roleplaying (always my preference), the Hunt (second
preference), or leveling (last preference ... with being fixated on looting
never being a preference).  One person (usually the receiving tank so the
puller can go out scouting right away and spellcasters can get to meditating
right away) get assigned "clean-up" duty and the best ones make people aware
of when they find something really good.  Something good is found and it's
either given the person that wants it or, if more than one does, its raffled
off to those that do want it.

However, there are groups that are great in every way except that looting is
a priority to one or more of the members.  When this happens, I usually also
suggest alpha looting.  Unfortunately, no one's perfect and whoever is to
keep track of who's turn it is sometimes loses track.  When more than one
mob is killed at a time, this only makes matter worse.  Thus I'm wondering
if Verant could design a random loot giver program.  Here's my idea:

Just as auto-split is an option, a Random Loot Giver could also be an
option.  When this is turned on, nothing can be looted until everyone in the
group has their auto-attack turned off.  Once battle is over, anyone can
loot the corpses.  When they pick up an item, all party members see it in a
pop-up window and can choose to be part of the raffle or not.  You can right
click on it to see its stats.  It would also tell if you can't use the item
(due to possibly class or race restrictions), that you have no open slots
for it, or it would put you over your weight limit.  No slots or too heavy
and you can drop or destroy something you currently have to make room for
it.  Then once all have either decided to be part of the raffle or not, the
computer does the raffle and gives it to the person that won it.  No looter
giving it to winner.  Computer just does it "magically".  All this being
possible while people meditate so it actually helps cool the heals of tanks
and enables spellcasters not to waste time that could be also used to build
up mana again.

Nice little bells and whistles on this idea could be:

+ Only those that can use something get to be part of the raffle.  This
decided by the group leader when setting it up.

+ Members can choose to just receive coins and no drops or no coins and just
drops.  No improvement in chances to win the type they want.  Merely no
bothered with the ones they don't want.

+ Members can select to be in on the raffle of certain kinds of coins.  You
check off the boxes of the coins you don't want to be part of the raffle
for.  Wouldn't mean you get a better chance at the coins you do want (most
likely the more valuable ones), but merely you've decided that you don't
want to be burdened down with say a billion copper pieces.  No one wants a
type of coin (most likely copper) and a prompt lets the party know this and
that unless someone agrees to take that coin, it will be left on the corpse.

+ Members can assign all or a portion of their percentage to win loot and/or
their coin cut to another member.  Personally, I've been in parties where
the tanks were just happy to have a cleric and they routinely gave me (I'm a
cleric) the coins they got (even platinum ones) as their way of saying
"thanks".  This option could also be used to get desired members into a
group.

So what do you think of this idea?
