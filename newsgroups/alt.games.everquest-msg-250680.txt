The same thing happens to me when we get up to the massive raid levels 
of play.  I've been able to avoid, by and large, the impulse to farm or 
trade skill in order to fund gear; by and large I've found gear to be 
less important than level, and that there always seems to be enough 
money to buy the spells I really need.  But eventually I get to the 
point where I'm expected to spend six hours at a stretch on a raid 
encounter (which I don't mind, honestly), and then do the same encounter 
again and again (which drives me nuts.)  Once is a fun new challenge, 
three times is getting it right... but once we've got it, I'm ready to 
move on.  Gearing up a guild worth of people means doing it dozens and 
dozens more times, and suddenly its not an adventure, its a job.

When I did do trade skilling, I was the same way; as long as I was 
progressing to new items, I didn't mind the repetitiveness of doing 50 
combines of this or that in a ten minute period... but at the high end 
it came down to spending several minutes for each combine, and advancing 
at a glacial rate of a skill point in a day, still doing the same thing 
over and over... well no thanks.

Yeah, does seem to be a major shakeup.  Isn't the first though, and I 
honestly doubt it will be the last.  Wonder how many people would have 
to quit in order to really kill EQ; 20%?  50%?

Bard is indeed a great alternative class, not just because its powerful, 
good in groups and soloable... but because its so different than other 
classes; each song is relatively wimpy compared to the spells you are 
used to, but you can run three overlapped at a time (or four or five... 
or two if you really suck at it), and pay no mana for almost all of 
them; it turns many of the assumptions of other caster classes on their 
heads.  Its NOT a good class for someone chatty, though, as its the most 
constantly busy class in the entire game, clicking at least once every 6 
seconds, but to be really good, more like four times every 4 seconds 
(juggling instruments, weapons, and twisting more than the 3 song 
minimum)  Its very hard to get a word in wedgewise... heck, its often 
hard to pay attention to what other people are saying!

Druid is a pretty good class if you don't mean to go to the high end of 
the game, group and solo friendly, not heavily reliant on gear.  Biggest 
complaint I can think of is that its not heavily desired for groups; 
good in them but most people don't seem to know that.  I have a 34 druid 
and have grouped and hung out with druid friends up to 65 with one or 
another class, and thats the principle concern I've seen with the class; 
ignore the whole Port Taxi Nerf, thats just small time easy money that's 
no longer really viable.

Well, we could start up together on Morell Thule perhaps, where we'd 
have the resources of a 65 cleric, 57 bard, 51 shaman... I'd just have 
to delete one of the "lesser lights" on that account.

Another temptation for me would be to set up a second account for my 
son, who's been playing (against the EULA I know) on my account for 
several years now; if I get DSL in here which seems likely, we could 
both play together.  Heck, he might finally get a character over tenth 
level, and at 7 he's a much better player than he was at 4.  Down side 
would be that he'd be able to communicate with me by yelling across the 
house, which might piss off the wife... not to mention doubling my 
payout monthly... worst part thought would be that it would become even 
harder to get him playing outside than it is now; at the moment I can 
just deny him access to my machine, I'd have to start kickin him off his 
own!
