The way it is *supposed* to occur is a weapon that has a dmg less than the
pets' normal damage will increase the chance for a max hit.  The delay will
always remain 30. If the weapon has a greater dmg rating than the pet, the
pet will be now do more damage.  Once a pet reaches a level that it can dual
wield but it is not automatic, you do want to provide any 2 weapons to get
the dual wield benefit (even rusty weapons work for this).
