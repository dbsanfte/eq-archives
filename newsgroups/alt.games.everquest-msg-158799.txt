Hmmn - not really either one, but a bit of both. Not only Socialist's have
anti-corporate sentiments. Maybe the person doesn't have any particular
pidgeon hole apart from "spamming asshole" and maybe "enviromentalist".

Nope - this is where the cynicism really comes in strong actually.

No, I do not believe all people are mindless, but I definately think they
are in the majority. It would just be the "stupid fucks" part that I believe
applies to all persons, myself most definately included. I also fully
realise I am actually quite insane which is about the only unusual thing
about me (most insane people don't think they are). Quite often I wish I was
part of the mindless crowd though, because the mind I do happen to occupy is
not the most pleasant one to live with.

Hmmn - I thought you were the person who referenced stuff about terrorism to
some right wing nationalistic news site which was the origin of my jab.
Apologies as I seem to have confused you with someone else. This would be
the part where I underline the part where I mentioned that I am also a
Stupid Fuck as well....
