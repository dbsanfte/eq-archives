My lvl 26 Mage tried to do her first research for the fire pet today, and
ran into a problem.  I went to Mythiran Tower website to get the Research
components list, and it said that the lvl 24 fire pet needed one jade shard
and Words of Dimension.  I tried to combine just one jade shard and one
Words of Dimension in my Elemental Grimoire, and I get a message, "you
cannot combine these items in this container type".  Can anyone see what I'm
doing wrong?  I made sure it was a jade shard, and not a jade.

Thanks,

Dreanna
26th Magician
