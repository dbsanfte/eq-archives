}Yeah. Right. Again, I ask you, how you can possibly think that using
}any of the above is not a bad thing? By *definition* they are
}offensive. Therefore, it is to be expected that you might offend by
}doing so.

They are tools for communication.  Think, for a moment, of attemting to 
commnicate as being like trying to fix a machine...  There's an old saying 
about getting a larger hammer, and those are the larger hammers.  
Sometimes, the *goal* is to offend, usually when you are already offended 
yourself.  And sometimes, offending is not a bad thing.  It may be what 
finaly unsticks the mecanism and gets your message through.

I generally prefer more delicate tools myself.   But I wouldn't say 
sledgehammers have no place.  Nor would I deny that smacking stuff up with 
a sledgehammer is just -fun-, sometimes. :)

}Refusing to recognize this can only be seen as rude and selfish. One
}of this mindset merely refuses to be held accountable for their
}actions is all. If they can convince that what they are doing is not
}offensive, and at the same time place the blame on the victim, then
}they can feel all the better doing it.

I'm sorry, I find the word "rude" offesive.  I mean, it's so -obviously- a 
rude word, how can you not see that?  Why don't you go back and find 
another way to put that without resorting to such obviously offensive 
strings of ASCII?

}Does it foster ill will more often than not? Yep. Say to a passerby,
}"Excuse me..." Then say to the next, "Fuckin' excuse me..." Take note
}of the different responses you get.

It also seems to vary rather more with where I put the accent on the last 
half of te phrase.  "Erm, fuckin' excuse me" is a lot diffeent from 
<Steve Martin>Well, excuuuuuse me!</Steve Martin>.

}This is a ridiculous exercise in futility. Congratulations on getting
}me more than a little worked up about it. Honestly, it's not my job to
}fix what your mother didn't do right in raising you.

Oh, bringin' my mother into it, now?  Now that's -really- offensive, bro.
You got somethin' to say, you say it to me, and leave my mother right out 
of it, ok?
