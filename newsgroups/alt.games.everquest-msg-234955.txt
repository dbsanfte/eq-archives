All I want to know is....

How did you (on top of the ice and not in the water) manage to land a spell
on the cleric (under the ice, and thus in the water)?

One method of avoiding being hit by spells, and also a cause of constant
frustration, when wanting a heal or buff, is to be in water, or not in
water, when the caster is in the other element, the spells DO NOT land.
