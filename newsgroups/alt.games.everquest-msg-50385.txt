OK, that makes sense then.  I keep thinking I'm going to run my twink
warrior to Icewell Keep and outfit him, or at least have him loot and
destroy the stuff rather than the damn zone beggars.  It's amazing how
the first beggar I run into there is someone I was guilded with 18
months ago, who begged then.  The really funny part is that he's only
about 5 levels higher and still in crappy gear.
Speaking of lev poofing, I've noticed that DMF stays up, even in
Velk's Lab.  Damn necros should be nerfed!
