I've insulted "42" in every post (three inclusing this one) I've made
on this subject.  He lied.

I never accused anyone of intolerance.  I accused "42" of lying.  If you
think I started the mud-slinging this late in the thread, you really
need to pay more attention.

You may not be hiding behind your alias, but "42" is.  You may not be
taking advantage of the anomymity your alias offers to make accusations
without have to worry about any damage to your reputation, but "42" is.
Worst case, "42" can just change his name.  Which I'm sure won't be
first time.

My long experience on Usenet has tought me that posts of people who
use their real name are in general of higher quality than people who
use aliases.  The most intelligent thoughtful posts come from people
using there real names, the worst trolls come from people using aliases.
Knowing that everything you've post could have an affect your reputation
with your friends, your coworkers, your relatives, seems to somehow make
a difference in the posts people make.
