Well.. let's see..

I solo a lot. I'm an Iksar so my banking options are seriously limited
(haven't done any faction work yet). I don't return to Cabilis after every
session (especially on weeknights), so the summoned bags wouldn't really
help. It's not just a question of selling the loot, but I usually need to
drop copper and silver to stay underweight. So I have to bank right after
selling. Most of my groups *are* pickup groups - and I would trust the
people to hold the heavy loot for me, but once again I wouldn't be returning
to town each time. So, for me, a tink bag would be MUCH more useful than
Jboots or Tboots. Plus, with the tink bag I have a much better chance of
getting loot to pay for the boots! :-)
