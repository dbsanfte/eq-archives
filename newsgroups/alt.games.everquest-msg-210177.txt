I've been doing nothing but charm kiting in ME for the past couple of
months. It's true that charm kiting generally breaks rather fast, but CHA
will help this. Find some nice CHA gear, and maybe get one of those +50 CHA
buffs from an enchanter. If you can get CHA to around 150, that should be
enough for decent charm kiting. (More is better, of course).
Don't trade WIS/mana for CHA, though.
Find the desired animal you wish to charm, and pull with snare. Charm, buff,
DS, and send it on its way to kill. :-)
The important thing to remember is to always keep it snared. Every time
charm breaks, resnare, recharm. ALWAYS resnare. This way, it should be easy
to keep thing flowing at a steady pace.

Good luck. Charm kiting is da bomb! He-he...
