Okay, had to share this story from today.  We were in the OverThere fighting
in a group and this Human Monk of level 34 is part of a discussion on monk
weight yada yada yada (he had 54wt).  Anyway, after mentioning that he loses
AC if his weight gets above a point, he asks....ready for this?  "What is AC
and what does it do?"  Now, I could understand a total newbie sub-level 5 or
so who had never played an RPG asking this question.  But how the heck did
he get to level 34 and not know what AC is?  Conversation ensues:

ME- Have you played this character from level 1?

HIM-Yes, I have.  Why?

ME- No reason.

*hanging head in shame of my fellow monk*  Of course he was playing a
human......<----------totally inviting flames wasn't that statement.  Just a
joke my usenet friends, just a joke.
