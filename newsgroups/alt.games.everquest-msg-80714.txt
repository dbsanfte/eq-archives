Making swatches never fails, but you don't make them from threads; you
make them by combining two spider silks. 
With the threads you make from two spiderling silks you either combine
two to make silk bandages, or three to make silk cords (used for
higher tailoring). Stick with making threads and swatches till they
cap at skill 17. 
Also, hang on to cat and wolf pelts, ruined pelts combined with a
pattern give you patchwork armor, and since you are a wood elf, you
can wear both cat (medium) and wolf (small).
