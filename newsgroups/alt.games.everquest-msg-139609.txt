Ok  Dawnshroud... pointless Nexus is 2 zones away... very small zone
to run through (Netherbian Lair).
Twiligh Sea, thas good, cut out some hairy zones for the young ones.
Grimling Forest....  not so bad either...

How bout a port to Sanct Seru.   Sanct has several mini pyramids in
them... great portal spots.

hmm... and where are they porting to?  I dont recall any spires, druid
rings, or dragon circles?
