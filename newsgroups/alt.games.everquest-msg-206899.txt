Ok, lemme use my guild as an example.  I'm one of the raid leaders.  When we
get ready to face a mob we've never faced, I'll check and see if I can find
out any info on the mob.  If I can, that info will impact if not dictate our
strategy, because like you said, no point reinventing the wheel.  Most
people don't even get to the point of doing any sort of research, much less
formulating an original plan.

That's the way most guilds work, at most any raiding level.

As well, I have had to work out strategies on mobs that either nobody had
any sort of inside scoop on or, rarely, because as far as we knew nobody had
ever fought the mob (or won) before.  Like you also say, it's not rocket
science.  But at the same time, that's me or one of a couple people in my
guild.  The rest of my guild has little interest in strategizing about the
mechanics of a fight, they'd just like to be informed as to what they're
supposed to do so they can get down to business.  :)  That, too, is the way
most guilds work.

Seriously, try this exercise.  I regularly lead my guild into the unknown
(and unknowable when I ask a friend in a higher level guild how to take
down a mob and they say they do a weaponshield chain...  and I count two
rangers on my raid).  In spite of that, when I count up the mobs I have
encountered without *any* prior knowledge whatsoever, the number is quite
small compared to the fights I went into with a hint or even a full blown
plan.  List them out.  The mobs you've fought (and killed...  to be fair,
being a monk I could go running around and take a swing at anything) without
any prior knowledge at all.  I bet for 98% of the people playing EQ, that
list is zero.
