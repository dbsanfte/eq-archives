Well... It's an observation of many people, among them me and three of
my friends, that IBM disks tend to have bad blocks from the day
they're bought, and develop new ones on a regular basis. 

New harddisks aren't supposed to have bad blocks _at all_, and disks
shouldn't develop any until just before they die (after five-ten
years!).

There's also this: http://www.tech-report.com/onearticle.x/3494

The tech report is one of the last really reputable sources of info on
the net, so their word carries weight. 
Still, there's no hard evidence that the IBM harddisks have quality
issues (so please don't sue me, IBM!).
