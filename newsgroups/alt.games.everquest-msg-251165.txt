> 1) At lvl's 1-30? Mage or Wiz?
Define what they need to be better at.

> 2) At higher lvl's 30-50? Mage or Wiz?
Same

> 3) To solo with pet?  Mage or Wiz?
Mage with pet, or Wiz without pet, they both are excellent dps casting
classes
>
> 4) Overall "fun to play" factor? Mage or Wiz?
Mages have good nukes, can summon excellent no-rent gear, and can solo many
places with their pet. Wizards have the best DD spells, limited pet
functionality, but can kite if you know what you are doing. The class is
only as fun as you percieve it. If this doesn't answer your questions, log
on Test server make a mage, and test buff it, play it for a week, then
repeat with a wizard and you will be able to make a much more informed
decision. That's what test is there for.
