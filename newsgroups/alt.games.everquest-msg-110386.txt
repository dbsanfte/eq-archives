Howdy again :o)
I'm Lvl 52 and seek better no drop gear. Anyone know of anything better? I have just
joined a great guild but I kinda baulk at asking them to help me get better stuff
until I'm an established member that has helped them on more raids. I can't afford to
go buying RBB's and high end stuff 'cos the gankers are very common and will ususally
wait until you're engaged with mobs before casting on you and helping themselves to
your gear.
Not whining, I accept it's a pvp server but my resists really suck and I'm fair game
for druids and wizards who can wax me in two or three casts.
Check out my profile - the blank spaces (and laughable items like derv rings), I have
better gear for, but I keep 'em in my Tinkerers bag unless I'm raiding or deep in
some dungeon. Favourite trick for random PKers is to zone in invisible and knock over
a player when low on HP's, loot and gate out before anyone realises what's happened.
