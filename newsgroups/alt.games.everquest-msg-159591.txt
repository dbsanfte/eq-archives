I was kinda upset that they didn't have more low level werewolves. Last year
I had a lvl 30
druid so it was kinda cool. Then I quit for a while and just started the
other day. Even though
I was only lvl 11 it was still kinda cool racing around the zone trying to
find some decent loot.
Managed to get my warrior a frost giant belt, fine steel bracers and the
helm. All in all it
wasn't too bad. Better then almost every other day of the year when they
have no events
at all. I say if you're really that unhappy with the event, then go to one
of the many other
zones in the game and quit whining....
