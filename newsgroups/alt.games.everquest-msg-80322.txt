Yeah I'm in Kelethin. Handy suggested I try Butchblock Mts. Still
travel is out of the question till I get my ink and maps done up. What
I've been doing is starting chars in the various cities and taking a
look see. Took a look at FP and it seems easy to get around in. I'm
also famialer with Qenyos and Surefall Glade and have maps for the
last 2 areas. I might try and beg a ride  It just seems so damn hard
to keep my bearings in the Faydark. Of course that was probably the
intent. One more level at Kelethin then I'll move for sure. Working on
kick now.
