What if they did it like CoH instances outdoor zones?  For those who have
not played CoH, it basically works like this: when a zone gets enough people
in it, a new instance is created.  When you zone into a zone, you get a menu
which lists the instances (e.g., "Atlas Park", "Atlas Park 2"), and you can
pick which one to zone into.  On "who" lists, it shows which instance people
are in, so you can make sure to go to the right instance if you are trying
to meet up with friends.

I hope the web interface to this stuff is simple enough to reasonably
script.  I have a script on my Linux box that goes and polls the DAoC site
every few minutes, checking the status of all my friends.  If the "last on"
time of any of them changes, it plays the DAoC "Call to Arms" music.  I
start this on weekends when I'm planning to play with a friend, but we
haven't set aside a particular time, and then go about my business,
watchting TV and doing chores and stuff, and when he gets on, my Linux box
starts playing the DAoC music, and I go boot my Windows box and join him.
Works great, and wasn't too hard, because querying this stuff is just a
simple GET request with the server name and character ID as arguments.

Comparing the design of Sony websites to Mythic websites, I see Sony goes in
for a lot more scripting and stuff like that (hell, for a long time,
everquest.com didn't work well in non-IE browsers).  I hope someone smacks
the Sony web people on the side of the head and says "make the site
simple!".  (Dare we hope that they make all the data available in some XML
format, so that automating things is really easy?)
