One of the worst is out in FoB newbie area in the pit. If something
turns to run at the end of the fight and reaches the pit wall, you'd
best kill it very fast. Otherwise it blips out of existance, goes under
the world, and starts wailing on you. There is no way to clear it except
to go zone into Cabilis. Even if you stand next to the troopers at the
gate with it wailing on you, they will not respond. You have to zone to
clear aggro. Annoying as all fuck indeed.
