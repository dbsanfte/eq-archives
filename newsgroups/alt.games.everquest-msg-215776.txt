So, avg level 38.

LB is 2/3rds of level min.  DB is 75%.  So, lowest mob
level was 27 (3/4ths of 36).  Max hit is 95.

Any chance you asked the Pally how many points he got in the first?
I'm guessing he got the full 5.  How close you get to the theoretical
maximum seems to be dependent on how far above the dungeon level
you are.
