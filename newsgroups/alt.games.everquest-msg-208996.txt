That's what I figured, just wanted to find out for sure.  So, can a 
permarooted mob be rooted?  If so, does this change his aggro mechanism?

I seem to recall from doing the shroom in Echo several times that he does 
not actually ever summon me if my pet engages him.  Don't recall if he 
will summon me if my pet is not there, never tried it without a pet.  A 
normal mob would summon me several times with my pet on him if I don't 
root the mob.
