Which is EXACTLY why the "artificial" barrier in place on the FV
server is not needed. There is absolutely *NO* RP value in sitting for
20 minutes spamming a hotkey to pump up a language skill. It should be
up to the players to RP languages if they so choose. As it currently
stands the way languages work now on the FV server reduces the amount
of RP, by forcing players to go out of character (spamming a hot-key)
as a work around.
