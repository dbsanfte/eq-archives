Monk runs to camp, gets three mushrooms, which alternate casts and keep
breaking feign death. Monk dies.

Against some mobs, fd is great. i.e., non-casters.

If you have a 51 monk who can break the shroom camps, please tell me what
server you are on, so i can create a character on that server whose sole
purpose existence will be to observer you. Halfling rogues are good throaway
scouts.

 Perhaps it is possible with better gear than i possess, but i doubt it.

I have no trouble breaking mobs of skeletons in DL, poachers in JPF, and so
on, without harmony, but any caster mobs (eg grim forest) just chain cast,
and a mass of them will make fd useless.

p.s. how do you buy characters on ebay? I've never so much as seen the
website, and am surprised that it can be done. I presume the login for the
character is what is traded? Or is it the credit card number? Sounds like
you'd be very vulnerable.
