I know it's kind of improper form to make an entire post to say I agree, but
just wanted to add a few things on the Keep.  I personally LOVE this zone.
The convenience of having a shop and bank within seconds from the fighting
spot is amazingly helpful.  Also a rumor that I've heard and don't really
know the full truth of it (doesn't really apply to since you're a gnome, but
thought I'd add it in anyway) is that if you are a race that levels slower
(i.e. Iksar, Ogre, Troll, etc) this is a city zone and that xp bonus does
not apply to you.  I'm not sure if that would affect Halflings as well and
therefore be a negative for them, but it's all rumor anyway.

The ONLY bad thing about this zone is its popularity.  Everyone loves it so
it can be hard to find a group there.  What I would suggest is go there when
you have a good chunk of time to dedicate to the game, wait till you can get
into a group and then once you're in, STAY there until your eyes are
bleeding from staring at the screen for so long, and then stay a bit longer.
You can do it soldier, stand and fight, or sit and cast whatever the case
may be.  :)

Good luck to you out there.
