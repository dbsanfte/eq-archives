   Yes, of course.  I knew from the start
that I was talking to another person.  But
the flavor of the language he used was the 
same as what the NPC's use.  But there is 
no doubt that he was NOT an NPC.  The real
question was, was he a Verant shill or 
just a run of the mill player setting up 
his own "quests".
