Hello, where would a Shaman 37 go hunt for a full group? I am currently in
the Great Divide. Bear hunting gets kind of slow now expwise, if you stay
in a full group. I'm not much of a soloer or partnerer (?), though, and
prefer the commodities and security of a full group. As I also try to make
a bit of money: Where would you go? For money you'd hunt Hill Giants, but
I was there .. totally overcamped, not for experience. I pondered going
to crystal caverns, as it seems to be about my level and offers a few
rare drops that maybe could be made into money. I am a bit afraid of
not finding people there to group with, as it is a bit off-path and
I start playing at Euro times (i.e. when you americans sleep .. ideal
solo time, but not for groupers like me). Or should I go to the Dreadlands,
which seem to be popular .. I might be a bit underlevel for that, though?
