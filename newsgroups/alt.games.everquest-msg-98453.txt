I wouldn't be playing the game if my husband weren't, I can say
that. :)  We're both lucky that the other likes it, because we are the
sort that would play a game if the other didn't want to (did that make
sense?).

The only real downer to having my spouse play is that while we are a
Really Good Team, it means we don't put up with much in the way of messy
groupings.  We are used to vocal communication and intuiting what needs to
be done next.  Not that many people can't do this in game...many do, but
we haven't yet forced ourselves to learn how to do this with people that
aren't sitting next to us. (Whew, I'm a real winner with the baffling
sentences today.)

We are, of course, trying to get various family members and friends into
Our World, but we haven't had too much luck yet.  To much anti-computers
anti-SatanicRPingGamesYouFreaks stuff going on there.  *sad sigh*
