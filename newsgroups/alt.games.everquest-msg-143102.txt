If they do it the same way as they did when they removed 30/35/40/45 hells,
I suspect that xp totals will be adjusted such that you're the same
percentage through the same level as you previously were.  This would result
in most people getting a little "free" experience, most notably those who were
close to the start point of a post-50 hell level.  (As opposed to your
example above which might result in a level-up, but no real change in
absolute xp total.
