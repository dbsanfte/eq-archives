Feel free to write a test script, plan and process for all combinations of
hardware, software drivers (one particular network driver broke certain
parts of WoW, odd but true), character levels, character gear combinations,
character aa combinations, character buff combinations, character
positioning, speech, GUI layout, etc., etc., etc.

I'm pretty certain that the code is tested before it's deployed.  In fact,
much of it is hosted on the test server in advance.  But testing for an
environment in which there are this many variables is extremely expensive,
and other industries mitigate that by using formal languages which can be
mathematically proven.

Give them a break - it's never as easy as 'just test it'.
