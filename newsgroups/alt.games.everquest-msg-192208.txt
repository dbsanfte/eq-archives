If Gorgoth's vaunted "loophole" boils down to the tired and very much
discredited "I'm selling my time spent acquiring the item(s)" reason,
I'm going to be terribly disappointed.

But it probably is, seeing as how he said scalping was legal in every
state, not because there aren't states that have made it illegal, but
by simply changing the semantics referring to what you're doing when
you're scalping.

If you believe that works, you gotta believe every judge in this
country's a moron, or that no meaningful laws exist whatsoever.
