EQWindows worked awesome until yesterday when the patch broke it.  Hopefully 
an update will come out soon to get it working again.  I was having a blast 
with my newly created Frog Shaman and Frog Warrior.  I do have access to a 3rd 
account and was even thinking of adding a Frog Wizard to complement them.  For 
now it's back to one boxing though.
