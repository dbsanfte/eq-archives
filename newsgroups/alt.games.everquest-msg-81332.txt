The "mill" you speak of is the Windmill.  This is easily recognizeable and
is where most low lev. chars. in LOIO meet to group up.  There are 2
merchants there and most low lev. groups use that as their grouping area.
It is safe b/c there are usuly high levs selling and can help out a newbie
/yell ing for help.  Usually there are 60-80 people in this zone and b/c
there are so many places to group its very easy to find one.  You can
group at the windmill, fort front door, left and right ledges, back door,
gob mines left ent. gob mines right ent., gob ruins, skele ruins, and
generally almost everywhere in between.  You must have caught the zone at
a bad time.  I would give it another chance as you will most probably get
a group quickly.

Log on and shout   "Lev 20 Beastlord LFG"
