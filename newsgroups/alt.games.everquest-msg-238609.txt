Definitely the 1M pp. I'll go as far as to say that I'd pay $100 for
1M pp. Not to twink out my character, although I'm far from the level
where there are no useful upgrades in bazaar, but to add the barbarian
mask (which I WILL get either way, buying or looting) and the gnome mask
(which has never dropped on my server, and the one time I saw one for
sale it was for 750k pp, which is way beyond my reach for the forseeable
future) to my illusion collection.

This even though I usually despise plat buying/selling as much as the
next guy. I'm just a sucker for illusion items.
