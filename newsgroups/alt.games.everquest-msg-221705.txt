Zone in, shout "is UbermobX camped" 

Beat
Beat
Beat

Joebob shouts "yes it is".

Mind you, Joebob has zoned in after me, and is standing there
next to me, but after those three beats went by and nobody spoke
up, he figures why not claim it himself, rather than let me have
it since I clearly will let it go if someone speaks up.

Yep, shouting is a lot like walking down a dark alley and
shouting out "hey, anyone know where the night deposit box is?  I
have a whole lot of cash here I need to get rid of"
