Plainsight is better than ultravision, plus see invis.  Thus my 
"plainsight instead of something better" line.

I agree that See Invis is a powerful tool, but plainsight items are 
pretty nice otherwise, generally.

I'd wear the 41% haste neck, no question.  I'd get an EB earring or 
something for "Just in case".  And I might buy the AA, since I can't 
think of any really -good- EB items, unlike the Plainsight objection.

Hadn't thought of that, but its true.  And if they -don't- then everyone 
who did buy those will be really pissed.

There is that.  Not  being a tradeskiller I don't pay much attention to 
quests of that sort, sure the Thurg shawl is nice but its not worth 6 
months of my life, I figure.

Ah, I see.  Why not say so?  Mystical effects, I thought there was maybe 
some kind of GoD or OOW new crap I didn't know about.

More buff slots good.  But one at a time?  Need like 10 more so you can 
wear full buffs including the bard buffs that are stupidly using normal 
buff slots even though they got a box of their own to solve their 
uselessness problem, and the recourse buffs and the HOT and the several 
tash/malo debuffs and DOTs and roots that mobs stack on you.

In fact come to think of it, its ridiculous that there's any limit at 
all to this; this limit only weakens the desirability of an assortment 
of classes in a raid, as you end up clicking off their buffs anyway, 
killing between 10 and 25% of their utility.

An AA you have to spend points on in order to overcome a limit 
originally imposed by Verant being frugal when setting up the database, 
back when that many buffs was just hard to imagine anyway, long since 
superceded?  Crazy.

It will still be a rare occurance, but the bigger the damage of a single 
hit, the less likely you are to hit that 10 point window; expanding the 
window makes it more likely you're remaining HP will fall into the box. 
  If you fall into the box and then a Cheal lands, you're in the purple 
club!

The eye candy effect can't be overlooked.  People will always like 
crits, no matter how often we prove that they are nearly insignificant 
on a statistical basis.

Yep, just be nice if there was a way to turn it on or off.  Ability is 
already in existance, this will just buff it up still further, anyone 
considering getting this should already know if it was a bad idea.

I think its funny, though, that they've used the wrong word for the 
expression, unless they mean they will be reducing the size of your 
hand.  Maybe large races will wear normal gloves, and normal races small 
gloves, and small races will only be able to wear gloves marked as pixie 
only.

I'm guessing most of the people getting this AA will already have more 
than 20 FT in gear on them, just cause they picked it up for its other 
stats rather than let it rot.

Rare post 60?  I thought it was only rare 50-60 spells.   I capped out 
my research skill and had a geerlok pen for doing research for just such 
a purpose, but never ended up with the right component sets for any of 
the few 50+ spells that were actually rare and desirable, it seemed 
easier to just get the spells rather than get the components!  (not just 
mage spells, but shaman, cleric, druid spells... I had friends of all 
three classes, but nobody ever came up with the components for anything 
they needed before being able to buy the spell in the bazaar)
