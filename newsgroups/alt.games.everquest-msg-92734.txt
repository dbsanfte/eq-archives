Amen to that. My mother has tendencies in that direction. I one had to
remove two dozen identical printing jobs from the queue after she'd
tried to fix a paper jam. Her usual reaction to things not going the
way she want is to rant and rave because it should work the way she
wants - this especially comes to light when she can't remember where
or what she saved a document as, when she can't understand that
different text editors are not necessarily compatible, when she has to
send someone a document by email, and when dealing with the printer.

I especially loved it when she got a  fax of a printout of an emailed
article, had it translated and wrote her own article around it, had me
print out the article and then faxed it to the editor of her society's
magazine, someone whom I presume has an email address.
