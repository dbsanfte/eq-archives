That is true. I didn't actually play much EQ this weekend. I have one
lowbie sitting at the beginning of 30, and another one just started
(at 3), and I decided to put off playing them until the new patch so I
could see the effects firsthand. My other characters either had
nothing important to do or (in one case) are stuck because I bought
too many damn ores and now she can't move and I don't want to sell any
back. I'll get the enchanter to come to ME damnit. :-p

As for time on the thread, I get to read usenet during some daytimes,
but not others.

Such evidence is impossible until they are actually implemented (as is
the reverse viewpoint, of course). Until then we can only draw on our
previous experience and what would have been different in them had we
done them with these changes. In most people's cases - almost nothing.
We would be sitting and staring at mobs instead of staring at
spellbooks. We would have gotten L10 a little quicker but most people
get L10 untwinked in about 6-8 hours /played anyways - not much you
can possibly cut off of that. The hell level experience is still
there, just spread out.

When you stop to *think* instead of trying to live off of vague
generalities its pretty obvious.
