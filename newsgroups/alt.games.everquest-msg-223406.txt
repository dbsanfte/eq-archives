In fact Im not entirely sure how Id know if they were testing me for
anything other than 20/20.

Im the same, if Im wearing glassess/contacts I wanna see, I dont want
to see 20 ft, if Im driving I wanna see the road sign as soon as
letters should be readable, if Im doing 70mph no use in only being
able to read them at 20ft coz I'd be past em by the time I could read
them

Fortunately for me, im a stubborn cow, and I have purswaded the last
optician who made me go out with glasses I felt I couldnt see with,
put my prescription up, interestingly it was back at the value it was
before... She set me out with a 0.5 difference, and I swear I was
struggling to read road names from junctions like traffic lights.. so,
I put up with it as long as I could and went back, and argued with her
about not caring if she felt it would strain my eyes, Id strain em
more if I was trying to read stuff I coudlnt.

I believe so, they've never suggested i have anything else wrong with
my eyes other than standard short sight.
