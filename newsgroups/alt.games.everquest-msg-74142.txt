I have a simple solution for people who dont take no for an answer. If i
want to get a port myself, I use /ooc, I specify a price im prepared to pay,
and leave it up to the porters to send me a tell.

In response to the original poster, I always sow people for free, and I
always charge *at least* 20p for a port. People outside velks can pay 40p or
walk. Give me TL and I will port for a lot cheaper.
I will never sow someone who orders me around (as per your examples).
