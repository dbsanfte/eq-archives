You were careful to use the word "murder", which is a legal term, and
draw a distinction between that and "self-defense". The laws that define
such words are also written by "the winners".  In the recent Afghanistan
campaign, at one point early on, one of our "smart bombs" had a senior
moment and went crashing into a civilian building killing several relief
workers.  Were they murdered?

Again, it's all relative, and it's all defined by who's writing the
rules this week.
