I've found that Root and Atone are great spells when a druid is kiting in my
area.  On more then one occasion I've been hunting Ulthorks in EW only to
have a druid run by with 2 and a seal in tow looking for a fourth.  Target
Ulthork, Root.  Druid moves away, Atone, pull.  If the druid becomes
hostile, I just explain that he's taken enough of our pulls (we'd lost quite
a few that were in route to the camp), and thank him for supplying us with
our next pull.  Typically they get the hint and move a little further away.

And when the druid dies and asks for a rez...  Oh clerics have there own
sort of sweet revenge.
