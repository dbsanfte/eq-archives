Dont mean to sound Harsh dude, but, quite your whining.
All your problems are well,
(whine - I cant get a group to level).
Solo till u can.
(Whine - Magicians are underated)
So are druids, shaman, rogues, wiz's, necro's, clerics, monks, tanks,
bards).
(Whine - There is an anti magician bias)
Yeah, all the other classes secretly meet, and talk about how we gonna keep
ya class down).
Maybe its your approach....Try it without the wine and cheese, make some
friends, have some fun.

Hell, I got a mage also.
No problems grouping...and, I have a blast soloing.
Sounds like you have a bad case of "Everythings not going my way, help"
