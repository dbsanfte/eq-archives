I don't think you will find ANY level 60 warrior, be it dark elf or even 
gnome, with 70 stamina. I'm willing to bet that you won't find any with 
stamina less than 100 at all. Dressed that is

Warrior, of course. He *will* have more hitpoints (because of per level 
bonuses, because there are no high level warriors with that little of 
stamina, and because warriors get greater hp bonuses after 50), and he 
will have better armor class
