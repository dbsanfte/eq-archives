I tried to get it to work with Dragon Naturally speaking based on the
instructions in the EQmanual_supplement file.

After retraining users 3 times I finnaly got to the point where it looked
like EQ recognized that I had the software and a trainded user that it liked
(it ended up eventually crating one called 'unknown' that it liked...)

At thins point I could turn the /mic on and when I'd say things the computer
would go really slow, but nothing happened.  I tried messing with the
vrdelay but no help.

I gave up.
