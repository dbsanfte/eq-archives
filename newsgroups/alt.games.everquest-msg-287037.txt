Recently I started a cleric to run as an alt/bot.  Got him up to 62 so 
far, engaged in reasonably vanilla activities.

But now that he's coming along, I want to be able to take him to some 
more interesting places, either alone or grouped with my SK.

THing is, some of those places are locked, and I don't know which or by 
what means.

Since the latest Hot Zone change, for example, the POP zone HOH has seen 
substantial traffic.  I'm familiar with the flagging process of POP, and 
  haven't run him thru it yet to get him in there.  However, a group 
which was short on clerics and looking for some time finally asked him 
in; at 58 and no flag, I knew he'd have to be Gimped.

Turns out as long as we had 5 people of sufficient level in the group, 
in zone or not (only 4 were) he could zone in.  When one of those people 
dropped out, he had a 2 minute warning message, getting a substitute let 
him stay.

There was some discussion about when he could zone in without a flag, I 
tested at 61 he could not zone in, however at 62 he was able to stay in 
the zone without a group; I guess that answers that question definatively.

What I can't seem to locate on the net, though, is a list of all the 
level required zones, with their minimum levels.

Also, a list of which zones allow this same "Gimp" entry; five people 
with flags allowing a sixth to zone in (or 85/15 for raids)

Then there are Instances; LDoN I know requires all members be within 10 
levels of each other; at a 62/70 split I guess this is no longer a 
concern, but I couldn't find this info for other instanced zones like 
DON ones, back when a 55 cleric might have been of substantial help; 
could I have brought him along or would I have had to wait till he hit 
the 60 line?

Earlier my son tried to bring a low 50's mage to help out/soak exp in a 
guild group farming a cleric drop somewhere in OOW, only to find his 
level wasn't sufficient (Somewhere off Barundi I think); again we'd 
never even tried to bring in someone that low level, hadn't had to do 
any flagging to get in, so we had no idea till he got there that it was 
locked to him!

If anyone has such a list, or knows where it can be found on the web, 
I'd love to see it.
