It CAN be frustrating when you have quests that require groups -
increasingly, I find myself leaving them until I can solo the mobs I
needs, usually 5 or 6 levels later when they're grey to me.  The xp
reward, and the item, is usually worth is, as item reqwards tend to be
desingned to 'grow in to'.

For the bigger quests, you can normally get a group - Zek access,
Enchanted Lands boat ride, etc, but for reqular quests it's often
impossible, unless you're killing the same things for a second quest
(as in Stormhold, where there are quests to kill things that you need
for one of the armour quests).

My guild has a website, and one of the forums is for Quests, and
that's a great way to get a group together, although you often have to
plan 3-5 days in advance (as it's a fairly casual Guild).  I'm looking
forward to these solo instances as I'll have somewhere to go for
decent xp and loot on the days everyone is doing their own thing.

And as for the guy who is bitching about the adventure packs - why the
moaning ?  I probably spend more on a hardback book than I'll spend
one of those, and for a lot less entertainment.
