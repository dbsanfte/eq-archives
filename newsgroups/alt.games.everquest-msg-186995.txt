The character was created on May 30th 2002 at 2am.  That was before I
had any real knowledge of the naming policy, but nevertheless I was
surprised that it was allowed.  Why I created a bard for the first
time at 2am I cannot remember, but I think I was having a go at
putting a few levels on several different classes to see how I got on
with them.  At that time of day, I was probably getting a bit short on
inspiration for names (something I struggle with at the best of
times).  He got to level 5 later that day, and was then parked because
at the time I didn't get on with being a bard.  Recently I decided
that in fact the bard is the class I enjoy most, and I decided to go
back to young Zappa.  None of that justifies a name that contravenes
the policy, but as I said, at the time the character was created I
didn't really know any different.  Having just been through a load of
the Vah Shir newbie quests with a different character I wasn't
inclined to go through all that again, otherwise I would probably have
started afresh.

If a GM comes along and changes the name on me, so be it.  I don't
have any attachment to it, or any other name I've used for that
matter.  Most of my time is spent soloing, 100% in this instance, so a
name change wouldn't cause me any inconvenience whatsoever.  However,
I'm not going to request a change myself, as I regularly see names on
AB that not only contravene the policy, they go beyond the bounds of
reasonable taste for a family game.  "Eatmypussee" indeed!

If you want to be totally anal about it, go ahead and petition it
yourself, but you won't get the satisfaction of pissing me off because
that's not going to happen.  Sorry.

BTW, yes it is a reference to FZ, and I'm a big fan of his.  But there
was never any intention to have a surname like Mothersofinvention - he
does not, and will not, have a surname.
