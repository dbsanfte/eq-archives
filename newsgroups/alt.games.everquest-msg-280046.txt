Obviously they will shut down EQ,not EQ2 in some time,
I am anxious if they are that bold to demand to buy the CDs
from their EQ customers to play EQ2.
Not that I would ever touch another game from Sony,I hate their
attitude trying to squeeze the last cent out of the players.
Probably its not only SOE but the entire Sony group,who has this
problem,I read some weeks ago in a German newsmagazin,that
their share of the world market for electronics entertainment has
diminished from 15% to 10%.
