I use to see these in East Commons, so I would run to the inn, buy
them from the Erudite, and run them over. Some guys would buy six or
eight stack at a time from me. They can pay for the convienence.

Rarely, I see any newbies selling batwings. I still collect bone
chips, I have a couple necro friends I hand them too, and if I am
grouped with nec or SKs I hand some over.
