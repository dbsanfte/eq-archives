Honestly, that's the way I've used it in EQLive. Turn on /roleplay, but 
make sure I mention my class/level in any LFG activity. I like /roleplay 
when it's used properly. If roleplaying, people *shouldn't* know much about 
me unless I tell them, which I am quick to do when appropriate. If I'm just 
out adventuring or exploring, it works as I would prefer.
