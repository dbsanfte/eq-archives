Wow, biz, I didn't expect such vitriol.

I don't want to embay because embay is against the EULA, and because I'm
having fun leveling up my character.  I'm learning how to play a melee,
which was half the point of creating the character.

I was enthusiastic about the fear-kiting method, but cautious.  I came here
to ask if it was an exploit.  I was told it was an exploit - James explained
it very well - so therefore I won't use it.  Simple as that.  I don't
exploit my way across Siren's Grotto any more because of the same reason.

I want to level up as quickly as possible while at the same time learning
how to play my character.  That's why I twinkled him out and get KEI and
Virtue as much as possible.  That's also why I don't ask my friends to come
and heal / cast DS's / pull mobs for him.  I want to learn how to pull and
fight and die - and even at my accelerated leveling speed, I *am* learning
those things.  I wouldn't learn such things from an embay character.

Give me some credit for finding out if something is an exploit before using
it.  Trust me, I feel bad enough about all the times I 'spouted my way
across SG; I am *not* someone who will intentionally use an exploit to gain
XP.

I am very much against embay; I could have made hundreds if not thousands of
dollars using my smiting to gain plat to sell on player.  I don't because
it's against the rules, and because I think it's a slimy thing to do
anyway - that people with real-life money can simply buy plat and equipment
and characters, while poor people have to do it the hard way.

So please don't make such assumptions about me and my moral character.  It's
because I *am* careful about following the rules and using exploits that I
asked this question in the first place.
