But that is not the case, FS weapons have a best buy/sell price that is 
much worse than Peridots.  Peridots are sold to vendors for a max of 
9.5pp, and bought for a min of 10.5pp, giving a 5% difference from an 
ideal price of 10pp.  FS weapons on the other hand are more like 10pp 
sell, 40pp buy, giving an ideal price of 25pp, and a 60% difference from 
the ideal price.  There are many items with an even bigger difference.  
So, there is some mechanism that SoE uses to set what the best sell price 
is, and the best buy price, and it is not based solely on charisma and 
faction.  They either have a set best buy price and best sell price, or 
they have an ideal price, and a variance from it that is the best 
buy/sell price.

If you mean that the percentage that the buy prices varies based on 
charisma/faction from the best buy price, then you are probably correct, 
although there is also a greed factor, and a factor based on the amount 
of buying/selling that has been done with that merchant that have been 
observed.
