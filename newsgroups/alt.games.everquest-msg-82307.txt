I'm sorry... I just keep wondering why you posted a thread about how much
you loved DAoC on an EQ NG... I suppose you might be trying to win over
friends and get them to come play too. As I said earlier, I *hated* Camelot.
I don't begrudge you your obvious love of it, but I do wonder why, exactly,
you posted here? Are you still playing (grinding through, apparently, from
your posts) EQ? Do you just want people to agree with you? Abandon ship?
What, pray tell?
