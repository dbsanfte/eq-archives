That's where I generally keep myself bound, yes.  It works out well for
travelling, and is not too bad if I have to do a CR.  The whole reason they
give for the tp to Nexus not working from Norrath is stupid, given that you
can gate to anywhere you can bind from anywhere, and that you can tp from
the moon to any of the destinations on Norrath.
