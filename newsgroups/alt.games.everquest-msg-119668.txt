Yeah, you ought to be just fine in PoG... Paying Tunare my respects was the 
first thing I did upon dinging 46 (although I worship Karana, actually). If 
you have some spare cash, you can also pay a Wizard to take you to the 
Plane of Air (you won't be KOS in the first island). I have a short movie 
made of screenshots taken as I jumped off the first island.
