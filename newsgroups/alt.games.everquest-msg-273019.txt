It's got a -1000 resist modifier, 1.5 second cast time, and doesn't have the
2.25 second delay after casting a spell before you can cast another. 
Lasts one minute per level.

Works up to level 73 mobs, only if they're not flagged immune to mez.  

It's handy as a backup mez on a hard-hitting mob that resists your first mez
attempt.  Rather than trying to survive for the 4.5 seconds until you can
recast your normal mez and maybe get resisted again, hit Stasis and it'll
almost always work.

The long reuse timer makes it less than stellar, though.  Level one is worth
getting, further levels I'd probably wait until you've got everything else
that's vaguely interesting.
