Hehehe, yes, I love this one.  Did it EVER make sense that a person can
meditate in the middle of a sprawling melee?  Seriously, have you
(nonspecific you here) ever meditated?  And tried in a bus station?  How
bout in the middle of battle?  ;D  So no medding in battle is great by my
standards.  And it just may alleviate the tedium for "pure healers" when
it comes down to "twiddle fingers and look pretty or melee" vs "med or
melee".

Course, all mage classes have the equivalent of canni for themselves, KEI
for others, and instant-mana-boost spells.  So a good mage means that the
priest won't run out of mana.

Assuming said mage doesn't prefer to nuke, in which case said priest will
shrug and pick up a weapon, because the tanks can't blame THEM if they
aren't healing anymore.

(I don't think a lot of mages realize that their role in EQ2 has suddenly
become MUCH more support than it ever was.  THey are the healers of the
power bar, for melee as well as priests, and if they want to just be
damage dealers their group members could very quickly get as cranky as
they do when a cleric just wants to melee and nuke.  Mr. Wizard isna
going to appreciate that new twist to things.)

They had that at one point, then removed it... I'm now wondering if they
added it back in, or if the reviewer was out of date.  I can dig up quote
where Moorgard has said "You bet your butt there'll be trains!"

I really really like this one. :)  The "Locking" in general is good,
because it makes it easier for the developers to balance the game.  When
you *know* there will be at most X people fighting a mob, you don't have
to make mobs overpowered.
