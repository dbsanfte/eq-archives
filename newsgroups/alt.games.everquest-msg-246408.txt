I never said I wasn't having fun.  I have had a great time getting to where I 
am.  I started about a year ago only with EQ Classic.  I soloed my Shaman up 
to the high 30s in just the old world zones.  Then Evolutions came out and I 
got all the other expansions and then I started grouping.  I've mostly grouped 
from the high 30s to where I am now at 64.  Like I said it has been great 
playing, however I believe that once you reach 65 the game 'really' becomes 
fun.
