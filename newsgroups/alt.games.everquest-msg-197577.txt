Get to 60 before going hell-for-leather towards AA.  Get Run 2 or 3 if
you spend lots of time indoors.  As a ranger I did get Run 3 / Regen 3
at around 55/56 then I went 100% reg exp until 60, then got a buffer
of 30% into 60 (an death costs around 20% - even with a 96% rezz you
still lose about 1% of the level).

To get your archetype abilities, I guess Run 3, then Improved Natural
Wisdom 3 in general.
Then to get your class abilities, Mental Clarity 3 perhaps in
archetype.
Dire Charm is nice, from what I've seen.

After you get your class abilities, you could probably go and backfill
some of the general and archetype too. eg Healing adept etc.

I don't play a druid, but if I did I'd take a line similar to the
above...but remember...conventional wisdom suggests you get to 60
before going all out AA.

Tzen

P.S.  Did I mention...get to level 60?? :)
