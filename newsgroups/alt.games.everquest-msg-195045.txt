Been interested in getting a few chars faction up with Katta for the
nice quests there (really want to get the eb item - since I pretty
much have all the organs for all my alts). Ive heard conflicting
stories about the viability of getting your faction to a decent level
here. Some say that its nearly impossible, others seem to think its
not that hard. Has anyone gone from KOS to a decent level in a decent
amount of time? And if so, how? I know killing vamps in TM will help.
Ive started a little guard hunting in SSeru, but this only seems to
increase the VC faction (and not the citizen faction). Are most quest
givers here on the VC or citizen faction?

Oh heres a tip if anyone is hunting in the observation deck in SSeru
and you die, DONT drag your corpse and jump out a window. The corspe
WILL follow you down, but then becomes stuck on the ground. You can be
standing on it, and its "too far away" to drag or loot. Had to summon
the corpse with my SK to rez and loot it.
