And yet... It is amazing that the people who post in complaint about every
little thing seems to think the money going to Verant isn't doing much for
them.

While I blew it on some of the numbers...  The fact that people don't get
paid small sums of money as far as networking is concerned.  Heck,
programmers themselves are not cheap, nor are they perfect.

The expectation of a lot of people for $10 a month to handle a lot of things
is ludicrous at best.  It is even more fun when changes happen, some good,
some bad... People complain about it and act as if $10 is literally their
life savings each month.

Try a car payment, kids...  Try insurance for the first time...  Monthly
rent...  Utility bills...  Costs more a month than a whole whoppin $3.00...
And you aren't guarenteed much there either.
