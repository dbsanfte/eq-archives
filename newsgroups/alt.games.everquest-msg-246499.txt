Think about it this way...  A highly popular place closes down,
everyone is forced out.  Then the popular place is reopened after
tuning (patching) and all the people come back because they like it
there.  Now, how do those tons and tons of people get in at once
through that one tiny door?  The answer is - they don't.  People who
have problems logging on after server ups are having problems because
there are so many other people trying to log in at the same time, or
generally there are too many people lounging around the Server select
screen.
