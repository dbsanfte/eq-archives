Not speaking for Tukka, though 50+ includes level 60.  With three characters
of level 60, yes, I've done just about all there is to do in Antonica,
Kunark and Velious, though luckily I have many more class/race combinations
to level and now better yet an entirely new race and class, along with zone
files.

Yesterday while they were patching EQ was painless.  I actually got to see a
sun set for once in three years. <grin> ;p  Though seriously, it will be
okay.. we will all get our fix sooner than never.
