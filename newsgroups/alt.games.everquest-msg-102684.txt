I went in to pull reavers last night for a group of us in CoM.  We got 
there as another group was finishing.  So when I got to the attic spawns, 
they weren't back up yet.

Waited, cleared, waited, cleared... thank God, first attic reaver is back 
up.  Pulled, ran back to camp.

We're fighting, keep fighting, yawn yawn, it dies, phantom pops up, as we 
start to kill the phantom... another black reaver runs up.  No one had 
gone up to the attic.  It spawned, and left on it's own.  As THAT one was 
about to die... the third one ran up to us.

They were agroing on us from up in the attic AS THEY SPAWNED .. and we 
were outside the building at the right turn around fighting.

On the second round, we got behind a little and the spawns backed up, so I 
went to pull, and 3 of the 4 black reavers were up in the attic.  No 
problem.  I'm a level 60 rogue and I did it at level 57, I can sneak pull 
them and split them.  No big deal.

Wait for the elevator to go down.  Sneak and hide.  Flip a dagger, rehide 
before it hits, drop down the shaft, high tail it out the building... I 
get outside and nothing is following.  I stop for a second at the end of 
the bridge, wait for a few seconds, and the reaver warps out on top of me.  
Run it around a little to make sure it is single.  It is.

Run the reaver back to the camp, tank engages, we're fighting... and BOOM, 
the other two reavers warp in on top of the camp.  (not on me, the puller, 
they warped in on top of the camp, away from me, and on top of the cleric 
and druid).

I've never seen reavers act this freaky before to be honest.

Anyone else had this problem recently?  I'd hate to run around saying 
something got nerfed, that happens too often.  But I *am* experiencing new 
behaviour in a spot I've spent a lot of time in since Kunark opened.
