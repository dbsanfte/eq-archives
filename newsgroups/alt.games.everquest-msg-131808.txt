}Essense of Fire - only thing I can find on Ally's is this quest: 
}http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1601 - minor reward, 
}not useful to anybody in our guild.  All I can find *off* Ally's is that 
}it's 'now stackable' in old news files.

Your guess is as good as mine, so it's probably for the quest you found. 
:)

}Regeant's Pouch - dropped off of magicians or necros in the Bonecracker 
}room and near, can't remember which.  Got 4 of them, can't find a thing 
}on them, either with Ally's or Google (I'm not sure I'm spelling it 
}right, but I tried different spellings)

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1275

}Bloodstone - just a jewelry ingredient, from what I can find.

Yea, jewelry ingredient, or spell reagent for cleric, chanter, or wizard.  
Very easy to get though, so probably sell it.

}Small Ball of Clay - all I can find out is that it can also be foraged.

It must have some use!  For some quest we just haven't discovered yet!  
Keep it! treasure it! :) Naw, it's garbage. :)

}Lava rock - brewing ingredient?
}Drop of mercury - temper ingredient?

Brewing ingredients for making dwarven cultural smithing temper.

}Russet oxide - temper ingredient that also seems to be a ground spawn 
}(ie, worthless)

Used to make dye for player-made fine steel armor.
