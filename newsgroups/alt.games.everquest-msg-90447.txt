No, I'm completely ignorant when it comes to CE stuff.

FWIW, I *really* like the m505. Especially the expansion card slot. I
wasn't really sure that I'd make much use of it, but I've already
filled a 16MB expansion card with documents.

The only complaint I have about it is that because of the color
screen, under certain lighting conditions it's not as easy to read as
my Palm Vx was, even with the (excellent) back light on.
