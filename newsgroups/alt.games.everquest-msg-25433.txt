No -- because it would be too easy to accidentally drop a bag of "uber
items" and have a RL friend pick it up to use or sell.  
There are enough problems for the guides as is.  We don't want them
popping in and saying, "Last week you bought a stolen AC 700
breastplate and 60 dmg 30 delay weapon for 40000 platinum.  Here's
your money; I have your breastplate and weapon.  BTW, that giant sure
looks mad at you.  Bye"
