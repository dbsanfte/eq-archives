"Poo" basically describes it. Marginally more interesting than watching
paint dry.

For the first 10 levels, you sit planting fir seeds in the 8 squares
around you and watching them grow. If one survives to maturity (takes 30
minutes), you get to chop it down and start again on that square.
Everything you do, takes your health away.

I think what really pissed me off was that it would not run together
with everquest, or anything else. So it really is boring. SOE is safe
