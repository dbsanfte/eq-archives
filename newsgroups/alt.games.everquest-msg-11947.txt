That sounds right.
I guess that this is to encourage grouping.
Have to ba able to do more that 11 damage evey 6 second to stand a
chance.
A full group can do this easy, but solo for someone getting xp owch.
There was me hoping that I could solo my druid up on the top floor for
another 2 levels (
Do all Goblin runts do this or just the ones here ?
Is this a good place to test if Disease based DOTs stop regen.
I can't tink of another level 10 mob that regens that fast.

Humm,
