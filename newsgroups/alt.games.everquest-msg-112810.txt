Half your luck - all mines comes from Korea. I signed up for a free trail
month of that online game they are all nuts over and have been inundated
with spam in korean text ever since, to the order of 20-30 a day.

It's easy enough to get rid of, after I removed the asian language packs off
my PC the subjects all come up as gibberish so they all get deleted without
a moments thought. A good thing I have my preview pane turned off and have
disabled active-x though - everytime I accidently double click instead of
single clicking to drag and drop they tend to try to open a shit load of
browser windows with more of their crap but are stomped by the security
settings.

Thankfully my isp still has a unix shell I can log into so I set up a mail
rule under pine trashing anything coming from ".kr". That slowed the stream
down to 10-15 a day which used differing international email addresses
everytime. How I wish you could set up rules based on character sets
used.... Well - you proberly can but not with my meagre knowledge.
