The only difference between your hands is that one of them doesn't always 
work and one of them gets a damage bonus. To make best use of your damage 
bonus, the fastest (followed by best ratio, obviously a 12/19 beats a 2/18) 
weapon should be used. The offhand has no such need to maximize the bonus, 
thus the main criteria is ratio.
