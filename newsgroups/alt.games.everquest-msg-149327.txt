For most, yeah.  I rarely have it memmed.  Back when they fixed it so that
it would actually work, I used it a bit more.  Now it's broken (may not work
on the first OR second casts) again so I rarely do.

Taunting is a waste of time before breaking mezzes probably 90% of the time.
Proper way for the tank to get aggro is to root the critter right before he
breaks it.  Preferably with a druid/ranger root.  I'm not talking about
taunting during battle...I hear that THAT's pretty useless, but that's not
first-hand info, just listening to warriors bitch.
