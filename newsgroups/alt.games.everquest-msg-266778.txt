So, how much do the web-based extras for EQ2 really cost?  On the account
creation dialogs, it says something like "Get these for $0.99/month, or all
four for $2.99!", but then the checkboxes for each list them as something
like $2.97 each, or all four for close to $9.

Anyone have any speculation on how the availability of these will affect the
information available on third-party sites?  For example, will most of the
people that would be willing to buy premium access at a site like
Allakhazam's instead buy the item info option from Sony, and so sites like
Allakhazam's won't find it worth the effort to have extensive EQ2 info?
