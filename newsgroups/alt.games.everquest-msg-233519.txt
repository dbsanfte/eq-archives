In the short term, you are right, in the long term, it makes no real 
difference, if you keep a constant split, rather than switching back and 
forth 100% to AA or regular, you will, in the long run, ding just as many 
times in the same time period, and you won't have to dick around with 
switching back and forth.  That being said, I still recommend just going 
to level 65, then earn your AAs, not quite what I did, but pretty close.
