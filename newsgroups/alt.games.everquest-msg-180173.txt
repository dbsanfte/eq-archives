    I feel very, very sorry for you.

    You can chain-stun those with your enchanters, can you not? The usual
worry about chain-stunning is that the boss will pop midway through, get
annoyed, and eat the enchanters. But if you can control where the boss is,
you should be golden. If you have the wizards for it, you can even AoE down
the adds.
