I'm going to have to agree here.  Wherever they know how to merge in
Oregon, it's not in Portland.  And believe me when I say I've seen more
abandoned cars in the Portland area after a snow or ice storm just
because people there haven't been able to figure out that you DON'T slow
down that much on a banked road or bridge.  If you do, you *will* end up
in the ditch/against the rail!
