<snip> Any tips on good spots to set up and/or where I can med in peace
between pulls?

If you want to play in Stonebrunt, I suggest that you head over to LOIO
first.  Hang out by the windmill and keep an eye out for the Sarnak courier.
It sometimes will drop a Goblin Gazhgul ring.  That ring has an instant cast
invis to animals spell which makes Stonebrunt VERY easy to get around in.
With that, you can roam pretty freely all over.  Just watch out for the
wandering kobolds and heretics.
