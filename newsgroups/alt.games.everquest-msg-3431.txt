I have moved to Vazaelle server also.  When I wanted a stein I set a
hot key.  WTB Mogg Stein 90pp.   That was IT had one in 3 hours plus a
breze.

Why would an enchanter sell it for more.  They could sell three at
90pp before some other person sell one for 150pp.  Old servers have
more money so maybe people do not mind spending 200pp for it.
