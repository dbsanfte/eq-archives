Since the release of Shadows of Luclin, Everquest has become
unplayable for 
many. 
 
WE would like to have our accounts credited for the time we have been
unable 
to play. WE would like to be able to get refunds for the upgrade that
is 
worse than most beta software. 
 
Until such time as that happens, We will not purchase any SONY
product. 
 
Once happy EQ'ers 
 
 
Sincerely,

Please take whatever action you normally do in such instances.
