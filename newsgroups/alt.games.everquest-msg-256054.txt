Delay is the number of 10ths of a second between swings iirc
A melee weapon will do (by itself) up to 2x the damage listed on the 
weapon. Why they did it that way I'm not sure. You can however do more 
than that, based on STR, primary hand weapon bonus, 2 hander weapon 
bonus, etc...
Below level... 20 iirc... there is a cap on the amount of damage you can 
do per attack. also 20 iirc.

DPS for a specific weapon is dificult to calculate... it really has to 
be parsed out for a specific person's weapon/skills/class/gear. However 
what you can do is calculate the weapons 'ratio':
Delay/Damage, the lower the number, the better. (if you sort by 'ratio' 
on www.allakhazam.com's premium search, 1.0 is 'amazing', and lower is 
better)

In *general* if you have two weapons with identical ratios, the faster 
one will be better (because ratio doesn't take into account things like 
damage bonuses)
There are exceptions to this rule, however, such as big slow 2 handers 
getting additional damage bonuses.
Example: If your stats and skills are such that, for your primary 
weapon, you effectivly add 10 points to your damage per swing, using the
Mega slicing orc sticker of doom! (Damage 500, delay 1500, ratio '3')
will be inferior to the
Speedy Gonzales slice 'n' dice (damage 5, delay 15, also ratio '3')
because in 300 seconds the msosod! will do (assuming you don't miss) 
1020 damage, and the sgsnd will do (again assuming you don't miss) 3000 
damage.

of course having not played in, oh, a year, and not played a melee 
seriously in, oh, 3 years, I may be way off base.
