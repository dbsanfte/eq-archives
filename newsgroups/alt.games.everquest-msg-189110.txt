What's the point of going through due process, if the intention is to go 
ahead anyway regardless of how this process turns out? (rethorical 
question... I know what the point is, to be able to claim that they did 
try the legitimate channels). The US may just as well have come clear 
from the beginning that they intended to go in anyway, and not wasted 
everybody's time.

So, again, the purpose of the UN is exclusively to rubber-stamp US 
foreign policy or else shut the fuck up.

And now you don't? Who's having it both ways? North Korea has clearly 
stated that they want those weapons, even if they didn't have them 
already, by pulling out of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.

/shrug. I can see that you do. Me, I haven't seen credible evidence from 
anywhere that Iraq is a threat to anybody, let alone the US. Unless, of 
course, the perceived threat came from their switching from the US 
dollar to the Euro for their oil trade.

I certainly don't support it, but I don't oppose it either. It's just 
that I dislike being lied to as to the reasons, much as I understand 
those reasons to be unpalatable to public opinion.
