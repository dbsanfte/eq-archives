Ignoring charm here...

From the perspective of someone that isn't elemental flagged, most
enchanters I know just aren't up to handling the mobs in a LDoN hard.
They just can't handle the pounding for the inevitable resists with
mobs that hit for 1000. Hell, my shaman can't take the pounding on a
resisted slow and I'm closing in on 6k hitpoints buffed. There are
exceptions of course, I know a Time lvl enchanter that has about 2k
hitpoints on me. He does quite well on Crowd Control duty there but
most of the people I group with aren't nearly that 'uber'. 

 Hence my earlier comment that any place where I feel that I need an
enchanter for CC, I'd prefer a bard. Bards can have most pulls under
control by the time they get back to the group and when something does
go wrong they can at least take a few hits.

Not sure what map it was but I do recall getting owned on a hard in
Ruj not too long ago. With all the roamers, it took us about 40
minutes and a couple of deaths just to make it past the zone in. ... a
most humbling experience <g>.
