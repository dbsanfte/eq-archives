Bzzzt!  Wrong answer!  PotG and _Blessing_ of the Nine are mana regen,
not hp regen.  Aego and Temperance regen neither mana nor hp.  Size of
hp pool and size of mana pool are rarely important, while mana regen
is almost always vital and hp regen is valuable in most non-raid
situations.

You type the words, and utterly fail to comprehend their meaning.

Go on all you like.  It might help you to better understand the
situation if you realized that the whooshing sound you keep hearing
is that flock of clues circling above your head.  Of course, you'd
have to open your eyes and look up first.

Is there any caster class that has no mana regen spells now?  Besides,
Chloroplast's 10hp/tick for 12 to 20 minutes is hardly comparable to
KEI's 14mana/tick for 150 minutes.

And another clue flies by, unheeded.

For your next attempt, you might try replacing "quick scan" with
"careful study and thoughtful analysis" and "at castersrealm" with
"of actual gameplay".

Good Luck!
