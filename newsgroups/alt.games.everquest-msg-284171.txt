As a low level SK, I'm finding more and more one thing holds true; mana 
flow is the most important thing I can get.

With mana, I can get and hold aggro reliably, slapping a snare on and 
supplementing with Terror of Darkness as needed, if someone else is 
pulling I can sit for a few seconds between pulls and generally keep 
this level up.

In an emergency situation, I can blow mass quantities of mana on PBAE 
str debuff (as an AE taunt), and Lifedraw like mad to burn a mob down 
and heal myself up; Lifedraws also serve as an AE taunt although not a 
very good one, because mobs hate a healer and that seems to count me 
healing myself with their buddy's HP.

I can't repeat that though, if I'm LOM, and if the pulling keeps up, I 
won't recover from LOM state.

Pulling, I'm even less able to cast spells; luckily I've invested some 
time in fletching so I have a decent range bow (100) and arrows (150) so 
I can pull without spending mana, as I can basically only afford to cast 
a single snare per mob, and if we are killing too slowly that snare runs 
out before the mob gets around to running.

I certainly can't afford any fancy pulling tricks involving FD; I can 
use FD to split a camp initially, but like the emergency chain lifedraw 
tactic, this leaves me permanently LOM, I can't repeat that; luckily if 
the camp is split properly, its not necessary to repeat, I can just pull 
singles as they respawn.

Contrast this situation to me with a clarity, though (or even to a 
lesser extent, a breeze); now I can pull with an aggro spell, I can FD 
split any number of camps, I can slap on str debuffs on any tough mobs, 
I can lifedraw several times per fight, relieving the healer of several 
hundred HP worth of healing and almost doubling my own DPS, I can use 
the bigger, longer duration snare, I can stack a few DOTs on to really 
lock in aggro.. its literally difficult for me to go LOM with clarity 
on, and unlike the other casters, I don't have to abate my casting for 
fear of stealing aggro from the MT, I >AM< the MT!

I was in a group with a bard and chanter the other day, and I could have 
been weilding a rusty two hander for all the importance my weapon based 
damage was making, I was chain casting constantly.. and the cleric 
commented that he was glad to see a tank he only had to heal once every 
5 mobs for once.

When he joined us, the chanter asked if I wanted Alacrity or 
Augmentation; I said "Clarity!"



Meanwhile, several times chanters have dropped by groups I'm in, hitting 
the casters with clarity, and vanishing before I can point out that I 
probably get more use out of it than they do, because they're limited as 
to how much casting they can do without getting the mobs angry at them.
