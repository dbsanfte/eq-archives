Reread my post. I mention a couple times the need for Atropine. I do not
recommend self medicating with it unless you know exactly what you are
doing. MOST chem attacks, the first medication is Atropine. But it can be
lethal if not administered in proper dosages. The homegrown medication
Jimsonweed (not sure but I think) also is a source of Atropine.

I agree with most of that as well. The water supply for the most part
(unless a downstream source is tapped... Is relatively safe). Small Pox and
Plague are not something that needs any large disbursement... They can
effectively be spread with little expertise. Many others require aerosol
deployment and the materials needed outweigh the efficient effort to make an
attack. However, there are many possible methods of distribution out there
that indeed have merit. For one example is Mosquito spraying equipment of
the south that are part of every day life. And ripe for use, with little
notice from those used to that processes. I will not detail any more devices
or methods further, other than using this one as an example to support that
concern is needed.

Let's not deflate the need to be cautious. Certainly 90% of people IMHO will
not need gas masks, or even treatment (on the most optimistic level). But
let's also agree to say that many will need it, and many might benefit from
precautions as well as anything they might be able to augment their personal
defenses with. My efforts are not to scare people, unless scaring them makes
them think long and hard about what they can do to protect themselves. My
efforts are to simply try very hard to get to the bottom line of what each
of us can do for our families in this time of conflict. I stand behind our
president, we need to take these actions, but there is no doubt in my mind
it will cause us to suffer at home. We have to be prepared for that. We for
the first time in many many years, are under attack locally. We need to find
ways to defend ourselves, physically, and even emotionally.

That's more plausible I agree, But parents with kids have a need to cover
all the bases. Simply understanding that, and offering some options, gives
them a peace of mind.  My attempt here is to provide information, solutions,
and tools, for each person to figure out what they feel is enough security.
I am afraid many of us are in denial in a way. We simply can't believe we
are suddenly thrust into dangers way. We are fooling ourselves etcetera. The
fact is America is now like Israel. Like any other country in the world. We
are vulnerable and very open to attack. The warning signs have been there,
and now the reality is here. There is no going back. This IS our life from
the 11th on. We ARE targets in ways never before experienced.

Your input has been the most intelligent and realistic so far. Thank you for
being lucid in your respose.
