Sorry to keep pounding this to death, but found the vendors by clicking on
the tapestries.  That was a huge help.  However, the only research spell I
could find was Gravity Flux, which is sold by the Wizard vendor Geran
Starshiner.

I'm really looking for Mind Wipe, Mana Sieve, and Radiant Visage.  These are
level 34 and 39 research spells.  Can anyone confirm that these are sold in
Katta?

Thanks,

Mike
