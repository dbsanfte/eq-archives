Both me and my brother play EQ, at the same time.  We are currently both lvl
8 and are fighting in gfay and steamfont.  However, we are ALWAYS broke and
were were hoping that we could find something that gave good XP and loot to
tide us over until 11-12 when I have been told we should go to Lavastorm to
combine our summoned-hurting powers.


Any ideas?
