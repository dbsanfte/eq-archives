    Well, if they're major twinks (probably are if they've always got Aego)
they probably don't mind you leeching along with them, besides you're not
*completely* useless, as ppl have said even keeping a dmg shield up on the
MT will help a load.

    I haven't done much twinking yet (just an emergency lvl 20 enchanter)
but if I did twink a character to actually play I would want to help anyone
unwtinked having just done that particular trial myself... Although I wish
sony would do some things to reduce its impact a bit, I did used to find it
very disheartening to have the rogue in our group main tank because they had
far more armour class than my SK. (happened at least once in high keep)

Cheers,
James
