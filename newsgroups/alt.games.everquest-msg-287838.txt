1) Should "tab
" key target the mob in front of you?

I am continually getting self and having to clear it all the time and 
mostly not getting mob in front of me.

2) What weapon do bards kite with? I thought my char had a bow and arrows 
and used that for kiting giants at one stage, but on return I had a 
throwing knife(which doesn't fire). Did they take bows away from half-elf 
bards?

3) What is it will all mobs running away the moment you finally get a hit 
on them?

4) Was mob agro nerfed? I'm getting about 5% of mobs that actually agro 
on me. The rest just ignore me.

<sigh, less than 14 days and I'm already parked up again and looking for 
another game to play>.
