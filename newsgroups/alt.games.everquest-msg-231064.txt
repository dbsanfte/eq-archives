[Note the cross-post.  AGE often has discussion of other games, so this will
be of interest to many people there, and it has lots of interesting specific
DAoC inside information, hence the crosspost to a.g.daoc]

At http://www.gamedev.net/reference/list.asp?categoryid=64 there are links
to postmortems for various games, written by the game developers.  The
postmortems are actually at Gamasutra.com, and you need to register there to
read them.

Two of them are for MMORPGS: AC and DAoC.  They've also got some interesting
non-MMORPGS: Black & White, Diablo 2, Unreal Tournament, and a couple dozen
others.

Some interesting numbers:

AC:
    Cost: multi-million dollars
    Time: 40 months + 8 month beta
    Size: ~2 million lines of code
    Team: 30+ developers, including 6 artists, 4 game designers, 15 software
        engineers, 5 QA testers
    Critical development software: Visual C++, Visual SourceSafe, Lightware,
        Photoshop, RAID

DAoC:
    Cost: $2.5 million
    Time: 18 months
    Team: 25 + 5 contractors.
    Development software: 3DS Max, Photoshop, Visual C++, Linux GNU C++ (The
        servers are Dells running Linux)

Diablo 2:
    Time: 3 years
    Team: 40
    Software: 3DS Max, Photoshop

Black & White:
    Time: 3 years, 1 month, 10 days
    Team: 25 + 3 contractors
    Cost: 4 million pounds (about $5.7 million dollars)
    Size: ~2 million lines of code

Descent 3:
    Cost: $2 million
    Time: 31 months
    Team: 19

Resident Evil 2 for the N64:
    Cost: $1 million
    Team: 9 + 1 contractor
    Time: 12 months

Unreal Tournament:
    Cost: $2 million
    Time: 18 months
    Team: 16

There are some interesting things in the DAoC postmortem.  Since Mythic had
never borrowed money before, they did not have an established credit rating,
and Dell flat out refused to lease servers to them.  Fortunately, they had
enough room in the budget to buy the servers outright.

One of the reasons they had room in the budget was they used open source
where possible:

    Because running Camelot would require a considerable amount of data
    management, we initially planned on using Oracle to store account and
    character information. However, Oracle's quoted license fee of more than
    $900,000 quickly removed them from contention. Once we got over our
    shock and amusement at Oracle's pricing, we turned to a Linux-based
    freeware solution, MySQL, to manage Camelot's data storage, which so far
    has worked admirably.

I wonder if SWG could have avoided their months of database problems if they
had went with MySQL or PostgreSQL and Linux?  Maybe they could even have
afforded to allow more than one character per server! :-)

The things they list in the "What Went Wrong" section are instructive:

    1. They didn't develop customer support tools early enough.  Even though
    the launch was smooth, so they had less problems percentage-wise than
    other MMORPGs, the game sold way faster than they forecast: 51000 boxes
    in the first four days, and they had staffed for customer service based
    on much lower forecast numbers, so early customer service sucked.

    2. Lack of a cohesive marketing plan.

    3. Dungeons and cities were harder than they thought.  Updating the
    engine they were using for better outdoor stuff was one of the earliest
    things they did, and they spent a lot of working on the outdoors.  The
    ease of that gave them a false sense of security, and the large number
    of models in a small space that you have in dungeons and cities turned
    out to be harder to deal with than they thought it would be, and they
    just didn't get enough done for launch (3 cities, 15 dungeons).

    4. Not having a credit history.

    5. Poor communications after release.  The method they had been using
    during beta--heavy official participation on internet message boards,
    simply did not scale.

The "Want Went Wrong" for Asheron's Call is also interesting:

    1. Poor project management.  Turbine and Microsoft drew up the schedule
    and milestones with neither side having any idea what the scope of the
    project was.  They had poor communications during the project because of
    a 3000 mile and 3 time zone difference.  When cutting features to try to
    get back on schedule, they didn't evaluate them to see how they would
    affect playability--and then they lost additional time having to put
    those features back in.

    2. Inexperienced development team.  None of the senior developers at
    Turbine had ever shipped a retail PC game.  Many of the developers were
    straight out of college, and some were even still in college on
    work-study.

    3. No feature iteration during development.  Features were schedule by
    milestone, and expected to be completed before other features were
    worked on.  For example, the melee system was speced and implemented
    long before they put in magic, but the melee and magic systems need to
    be tested and balanced together, so trying to develop one completely
    first just doesn't work.

    4. An ambitious project lacking fundamental underlying technologies.
    They committed to things like dynamically load-balanced servers and
    continuous, uninterrupted outdoor environments which were all unproven
    concepts in games at the time.  Add to that creating their own 3D engine
    and game system, and you've got a hell of a lot of R&D, which is damned
    hard to schedule.

    5. No documented high-level feature statement.  They never worked out
    with Microsoft an official set of features the game was to have!  There
    was no high-level vision or anything like that, making it hard to
    educate new employees about what was going on.  They constantly had to
    justify features, and had no documentation to fall back on when trying
    to do this.

Considering all the strikes against them, they did remarkably well on AC, I
think.

I'd love to see a postmortem like this for EQ, but I doubt Sony would allow
it.
