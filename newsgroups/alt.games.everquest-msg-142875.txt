/nod.  Or... _OR_ you might try getting away from arrows all together. 
To my knowledge no one was doing arrow sigs when I started posting
here.  I found a distinct posting style without a guide.  I just know
that you can do the same!

     I see.  So, what you are implying then, is that I am lying when I
say I am pathetic.  That I am "putting on airs" so to speak, trying to
portray myself as something I am not.  Wow.  What could be more pathetic
than _that_?
