Seems like I remember reading some time ago that the skill system has some 
sort of quirk whereby when you receive a skillup (or several in the case of 
streaks), there is an artificial delay built in before your next one. If 
this is true, and your typical series of actions involves hitting the taunt 
key and then bash, it might explain why your taunt skill got more skillups 
of the two.

Of course, there could be nothing of the sort, and it could just be a case 
of bash being designed to increase more slowly. /shrug
