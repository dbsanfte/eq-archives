I noticed that some people have suggested that having the class defining
feature of the druid (the ability to port others) replaced by the PoP books
(which are much much better and faster too) was no reason to complain. Well,
I can see both sides; it's a huge loss of revenue for the druid but sooo
easy for the newbie who wants to go to every starting zone (even cabilis, if
you don't mind a brief visit).

I think it would be fair if they do have an equialent of the soulbinder, who
does rezzes, heals, etc, for free. Why not? How do those books differ?

I don't feel bitter about the loss of income as essentially i was moving out
of that as being the main source and moving onto tradeskilling and questing
(rallic pack etc), but i'd hate to be a druid with my first port spells.
Telling people i can port them for a few plat and having them tell me that
this book does the same job, free, and without draining mana or being
interruptible or requiring human interaction of any sort. Reminds me of how
i always donated when i was sowed, but when i got sow as a barb shaman (my
3rd character, first caster), no-one would pay a shiny copper for my
troubles.

What about a vending machine set up in the graveyards of the planes, which
give 100 % rezzes for a 100 pp? I reckon they'd be very popular.
