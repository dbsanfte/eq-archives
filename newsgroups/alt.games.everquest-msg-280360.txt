Sony has to have people who actually study the economy of EQ, or at
least who worry about that kind of shit.  Prices are driven up by the
introduction of new players and the introduction of plat.  More players
mean more demand for gear.  More plat means inflation.  Prices are
driven down by item farming and destruction of plat (see also:
Shadowhaven casino).  Eliminating the Rathe giants would indeed slow
down the introduction of new plat on the server.  This would tend to
lower trading prices in the long run.  What I can't understand is why
the hell they would suddenly be worried about inflation now.  I would
think they had to be worried about inflation and deflation for years
and if they thought there was too much plat out there, why would they
wait until 2005 to exterminate the giants?

I'm guessing that this is temporary or maybe even a mistake.  (They
repopped the zone with mobs from Innothule on accident, for example).
Or maybe I am just over-thinking this.
