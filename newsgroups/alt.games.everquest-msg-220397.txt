Just as a point of info, when this method was first suggested to me, back
when I was playing my warrior, I did several tests of it over a night.   Not
once did the mezed mob ever target me after taunting, even though the
majority of the times when I broke mez, it stayed on me instead of going
after the enchanter.

So... my opinion of it was that it's a waste of time.

My usual mez breaking strategy was taunt, then wait about 4 seconds until
taunt is *almost* recycled, kick and attack on, taunt a second time.    It
worked on many levels.  If the first taunt succeded, it was all good
anyways.  If the first taunt did not succeed, the kick often stunned them
(over 55 warrior kicks do), giving me plenty of time to get aggro.  If the
kick missed, you've just put 4 or 5 attacks on the mob, to build some quick
hate for your second taunt.   In the very rare case that the second taunt
doesn't work, then AE taunt.

Worked very well for preventing aggro on the enchanter, and best of all kept
the group moving at a good clip, as opposed to warriors that would do the
"taunt dance"...  taunt 3 times, sit down, stand up, taunt another time,
then break mez. (and have the mob still go after the enchanter ususally)


(And a hint for some of you "pallys" out there...  one stun on a mezed mob,
used in concert with taunt, is almost certainly going to gain you aggro.
There is no need to do 3 stuns in a row before breaking mez, slowing an
adventure group down to a crawl.)
