My experience (Erudite magician, circa lvl 50) was to see sitting HP
regen start at 6 for a minute then go to 9 in the next. After another
minute, HP regen went to 18, then 27 in the next, and 36 (I was fully
healed, having tried to get some defense off the underbulks). I don't
know if there is a maximum cap

At 10 tics per minute, my HP regened 60 HP, then 90, 180, 270, etc.

I remember times when having lost a lot of hit points, I would have
expected to take 20+ minutes of sitting to regen back to full whereas
with the enhanced regen, I was ready to go get beaten on more in 5 or
6 minutes.

I have started working up Bind Wounds on all my active characters as I
remember one LDoN where the ability of a couple of characters to Bind
Wounds saved a bunch of mana and made the dungeon somewhat easier.
