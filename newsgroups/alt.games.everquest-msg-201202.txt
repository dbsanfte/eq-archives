I would do some research before deciding what EQ programs to buy as
different classes and races appear in different expansions (e.g Iksar came
in Kunark, Beastlord / Vah Shir came in Luclin and Frogloks came in Legacy
of Ykesha). Decide what you want to play and why, then decide what packages
are required. Do Google searches on Druid, Enchanter, Beastlord, Monk, etc.
and read up on their strengths and weaknesses.

Alternatively just buy the gold edition and play a simple class or two for
10 -15 levels (they go quite fast at low levels) to get the feel for
warriors versus casters. Maybe try an evil race and see what its like to be
hated / have to sneak around. Beat something into the mud with a sword, or
blow something with a red sparking spell.
