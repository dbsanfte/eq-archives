    Some BIG guilds have a ton of spam, but in general yeah, dead on.

    That can paralyze a guild, though. I've heard a lot of top-level
guildmembers complain bitterly about raiding so damn much that they can't
GET level 60, because the combined effects of 24/7 raiding and deaths on
raids hold them down. Many of the bigger guilds have raised the level limit
on applicants to level 60 not just because they want people with all the
tools, but because they know with their raid schedule that people who aren't
level 60 won't get there anytime soon. Some of the "legacy" members in my
server's top guilds are just hitting 60 now. Remember, Jazz: there will
always be some thing that someone in the guild wants, and the mob/camp will
be up/open. Always.

    That can be another area of dissent. :-) Some people couldn't give a
damn about epics, and don't have a rare spawn they want aid with. Or the
item they need the most is a spell/special ability that, if they only had
uninterrupted XP time, they'd get. You know the difference between a 54 and
55 warrior and what they can do is huge. There are similar jumps for other
classes, like the jump between level 59 and 60 for a shaman or wizard.
Without having the ability to find a group and stay with that group for
hours on end, they never reach their goal and feel frustrated at the guild
for constantly taking them away from something worthwhile.

    It's as though the guild is saying to them, "Getting anyone in this
guild an item is always MORE IMPORTANT THAN you levelling to cast Torpor and
Malo, since we can call you away from XP at any time to help with items and
expect you to show." And usually, if the person complains about having no XP
time, they'll be told how nobody has much XP time, or how they just need to
play more "when we aren't raiding". And that really goes over poorly with
folks with limited time online.
