Actually it's an old joke and holds a fair amount of truth, America
dentistry is obsessed with straight teeth whereas British dentistry is happy
providing some of your teeth meet when you close your mouth, sad but true.
If you say "But my teeth are fine" the well you haven't a problem but if you
had an over bite or crooked teeth the chances are, although better, they
still are crooked and you still have some kind of overbite.

Orthodontic standards aren't necessarily lower here but because much is done
on state health care the cosmetic side of things is less important. In the
states you pay for that work and because of that they do the job right.
