I'm a college student.  My computer and internet connection are paid for, as
is my dorm, my tuition, my food tickets, and my bus pass.  Of the $50 my
parents send me every month, this is the absolute cheapest entertainment I
can imagine.

Well ok, I'm long out of college, married and with a kid, but that didn't
sound so crazy, now did it?
