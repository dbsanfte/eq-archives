One vote "against." ;-)

I agree with this as well.  That's why I think the locked chests as
loot (some that bards can pick) as well as a "Knock" type spell for
a casting class that can basically function as a rogue of a certain
level would be a boon to the game.

No class should be essential for regular exp'ing or dungeon crawling.
I can go with the fact that some raids should need certain classes,
just because it gives those classes a place to shine (like having a
rogue scout for a monk in Hate, or having 4 wizards burn down Yelniak
with a Bane spell/manaburn).
