Very well the examples you wished for:

The US paid the price in over a million deaths and millions more
shattered lives along with a staggering blow to its constitution and
economy, particularly in the South,  the effects of which are still
visible today to the observant.

Africa continues to pay the price for its part in this crime, one of
the justifications europe had for slavery is that it was fellow
africans selling the poor unfortunates into bondage in the first
place. The fact is the slave trade could not have existed to any
profitable degree without this condition.This was later used as
justification for colonialism in africa by the euros, to protect them
from each other. Not making judgments only statements of history. 

Perhaps not as well connected but I see two world wars on its soil as
being ample punishment for past sins of the euros. With many of the
tensions causing the first war springing from attempted control of the
african continent by both sides. 

Shall I continue? History is rife with this cycle of degradation and
punishment, only a part of it having to do with slavery. Think of this
when watching a country choose between morality and debauchery, there
will be a reward for either path I assure you. We have paid for the
choice of slavery as one of the worst kinds of foolishness. What
escapes most people is that they refuse to believe that we will pay
for the choices being made today just as they did in the past.
