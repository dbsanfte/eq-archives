u people dont listen TRIT said originally "guards at entrence to arena"
which in my opinion would mean where the see-invis line begins. Its easy to
get to that point, even fighting to it (seeing as though u can invis all the
way to the see-invis line)..I just think the warrior being 54 needs a main
healer, not a 2nd rate shammy healer thats trying to slow the mob as well as
do whatever else need be to help in the fight..and you will get an add on
the first two pulls seeing as though niether of u are above lvl 55. Why dont
u just have guild help farm armor? or go with a stronger guild when there
killing mobs like KT, Statue, Vindi, and AoW. Thurg quest is junk to them
and will most likley loot for an alt or it will rott.
