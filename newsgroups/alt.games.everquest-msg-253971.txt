Having finally gotten to level 15+ with the only alt that I've
created since the tutorial zone went in, I went and got my LDoN
stone, and noticed something interesting.  (Well, I thought it
was, anyway. :-)  The very nice charm you get in the tutorial,
and that my older characters were salivating over, does have any
augmentation slots.  And the adventurer's stone augment doesn't
go in anything but a charm.  So you can never have both on one
character, which means eventually everyone "outgrows" their
tutorial charm (if they go adventuring).

I sorta like that.  Gee, maybe somebody designing this stuff
actually had a clue! :-)
