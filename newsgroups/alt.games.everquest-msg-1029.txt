No, it's not about magic cookies ...

I'm currently testing out a gnome wizard in parallel with a halfling
warrior, and I'll decide which I'll focus on once I level up a few
times with each.

One of the EQ manuals -- the real one, or the Prima one -- says that
AkAnon has rare spells available. Is this true? Is there a list of
which are the uncommon ones? Because once I leave town, it might be a
good investment for me to have a stash of those scrolls in the bank to
sell to other PCs.

Also, it'll be a while before I'm able to research, but is anything
required for it other than the components? Is there, for instance, a
spell component bag or something needed?

Thanks.
