I don't think that it's a case here of hating the US; though if this
latest farce in the Gulf goes ahead then the US will be having worse
interenational PR problems than it does today.

As the person who posted the reply stated that this action is purely
about economics.   Living here in the UK (and we are supposed to be
your biggest allies) I have not met one person who thinks that the
forthcoming war against Iraq is justified.

Everyone I know in the UK and all of the discussion programmes on the
television all state the same thing and the whole country is in
agreement with this; the action in the Gulf has sod all to do with
terrorism but about bagging one of the largest oil reserves on the
planet.

Our spineless leader (Blair) is stuckso far up Bush's colon that he
can't see that the population in the UK are against sending troops out
there again.  Obviously political pressure has been put to bear on
Blair; when the oil starts to run out the US will start to remember
who supported them in the Gulf.

Make no mistake.  This is nothing to do with the Iraqi state
sponsoring terrorism; if it were then how come the US and the UK were
supplying Iraq with materials and weapons?    The whole thing is a
sham and a whitewash and I am surprised you are casting doubts on the
poster's postion.
