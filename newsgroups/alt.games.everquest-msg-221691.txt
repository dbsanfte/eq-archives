The exact value that maxxes out your prices varies with your faction with 
the merchant, higher than 106 is required for the minimum faction to do 
business with a merchant, don't recall the exact value.  Regardless, many 
do actually start out with significantly lower charisma, and, so, raising 
it does affect them, even if they only do so with a couple of steins.
