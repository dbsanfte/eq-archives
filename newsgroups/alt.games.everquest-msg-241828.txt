Hi

Alt-tab is about the only thing left working on my AMD K6-2 550Mhz, 
384MB memory, Geforce 2Ti Video Card :(

Framerates in old world zones are what I use to have in Luclin.

PoK is now like the Bazaar it takes 5mins from the Ak'Anon stone to the 
Halfling bank.

The whole game is out of sync by a couple of seconds. Even though my 
lagmeter is rarely above 5% on either side of the meter.

Targeting is impossible. I have to stand by a stationary NPC for a 
couple of seconds before the "Out of Range" stops and I can interact 
with them or hit them.

If it's moving or running forget it and zone unless you have a range 
attack.

My machine worked reasonable well with DX8 now the game is unplayable.

But Alt-tab works :(
Yours
