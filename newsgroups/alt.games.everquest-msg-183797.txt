With the excpetion of the ports to Stonebrunt, ALL the new spells are
quested items. There are quest NPCs in Gunthak who only respond "correctly"
to you if you are the needed class match.

For example, the paly NPC would give you the quest if you hailed him whereas
the NPC would only give me a "hello colcannon"-type message if I hailed him.

I cannot remember the name, but I think one of the Paly NPCs is an Erudite
close to water over by the lighthouse.

Hope this helps....
