I'm looking thru a ZEM chart when I notice Shadow Haven listed at 100, 
thats a lot better than the 75 and 85 of most of the zones I've been 
looking at recently.  But what do you hunt in Shadow Haven?  Tons of 
mobs, many of them merchants, none of them KOS on sight.  Pick a faction 
to screw and then go ahead?  Or does killing anything in the zone ruin 
the place for you regardless?

I've never really seen anyone hunting here, despite the relatively high 
posted ZEM.  Does this mean that the mobs are still too difficult for 
the exp you get off of them?  I mean, say there's a level 50 mob and 
I'll get 75,000 exp for killing it in Fungusgrove, or 100,000 exp for 
killing it in Shadowhaven, thats great, but if I can kill 10 in 
fungusgrove or 5 in shadowhaven in the same time period, I'd actually 
come out ahead in the lower ZEM zone.

Sadly, the "bad guy" mobs similar to most of Shadowhaven's sets of 
trainers, merchants, and guards, are located nearby in Echo Caverns, 
which has a ZEM of 80.  I don't really see any reason to pick a fight 
with the guys in SH itself.  For evil races/classes, though, or people 
who don't really give a damn about such issues, I'd think SH would be 
popular, very near to bazaar, relatively near POK... whats not to like?
