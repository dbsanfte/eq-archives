The lead-in was great.  Over the course of a few weeks, various
changes began appearing, including some quests that stuck around
for about a week and then went away.  Good races could talk to a
new NPC in Felwithe about the apparent kidnapping of Firiona Vie
(the person, not the city!) and do quests for some decent rewards.
Then some new NPCs showed up in the Outpost in Overthere and in DL,
with rewards for helping the evil side.  (Though if you were
careful, a good race could get those rewards also, and there were
no faction hits.)  I actually spotted the latter NPCs and figured
out several of the quests the night they appeared, which was a lot
of fun.  Then Lanys T'Vyl and Al Kabor showed up in DL, with their
armies, and stood around for a few days; I think there may've been
more quests available there, but I didn't have characters of the
right level/faction to do them.  Still, I figured something would
happen at some point.

So I was actually rather disappointed to log in one night and find
that the entire event had taken place while I was off line.  I don't
know if there was some board I could've been watching that would've
clued me in what time things were going to happen, but as it was I
never had a chance to get involved.  (I doubt that my 50-ish chars
could've done much except get killed, or go link dead from all the
lag, but I still would've liked to see it firsthand.)

From what I heard second-hand, it was a great event to watch if your
box could keep up with all the mobs and effects filling the zone(s).
People were definitely freaked when Lanys T'Vyl crossed the zone
line from DL to FV. :-)
