You couldn't be more correct. I am a tank through and through and can't tell
you how many times I've been complimented on my skills as a warrior. I'm not
bragging though it does make me feel good to know I'm doing my part and
acting w/ in the group for a duel purpose: get experience/loot and living to
fight another day. The key is to keep those MoBs on ya! Granted a tank
should have the most HP in the group so you're also correct in your
statement that the tank is not there to give damage, he/she's there to TAKE
the damage. Keep that MoB pissed off at you so it sees you and only you.

Simply stated, the tank should do exactly as described; keep the MoBs where
they should be.

I've found a few tips that really help when it's time for battle:

- when the MoB has been pulled (by me or another) and is headed for the
group I will always position myself so that the MoB is between myself and
the caster(s) so that I can watch for any roaming MoBs who may try to agro
or if the attacking MoB(s) breaks away and heads for the caster(s). A dead
cleric is of no good to me and I will give my life to protect this honorable
class. *note on this*: if you've a rouge in your group have all those
meleeing on the same side as the tank. That way the rouge can backstab to
his/her heart's content while the MoB stays focused on the tank and the
rouge doesn't have to dance around trying to get on the MoB's backside.

- make sure that EVERYONE in the group is ready and FOM (or comfortable w/
their mana amount) for the pull. The only way you'll know is by asking or
being told. Don't assume.

- taunt, taunt, taunt, taunt, taunt, taunt, taunt, taunt

- Casters if you find yourself being hit PLEASE!!! say something!!!
Especially those w/ very low HP. Set up a macro and when the heat pours on
(like you know it can) all you have to do is hit one button rather than type
anything. Sometimes, in a full boat of 6 group members, I can't see everyone
so please PLEASE!!! call for help if you need it and DON'T RUN unless it is
your last option.

- Assist when there's more than one MoB of the same name/type and always
assist the main tank. If it's me then I've already figured out which MoB
should die first. It does little to take the pounding and HP loss from a
blue Sarnak only to have a pissed off yellow, full of life, ready to take
the entire partie's head off. If one of the MoBs has been mez'd then don't
start swinging until the main tank does. That gives a few moments for the
tank to taunt a few times and get right up there to the top of the hate list
so that the MoB does not go straight for the caster who cast Mez in the
first place.

I don't think you should get too many flaming email. Those "tanks" who are
not paying attention should be instructed and if they can not learn from
their mistakes and the teaching of other group members then they are not an
asset and should be dropped. Give em fair warning tho.
