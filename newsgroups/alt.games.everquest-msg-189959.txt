I got it the first time.  I got the error also.  I can understand someone
asking for a clarification, but instead of baiting, asking if you had gotten
that backwards would have been more productive.

For the life of me, I'll never understand why communicating on a newsgroup
has to be such a jousting match.  It's simple.  Someone makes an error.  The
corrector should correctly and accurately indicate the error, for the
clarification of all.  Then the original poster can simple acknowledge the
honest mistake, or indicate why his/her original post was actually correct.

Of course, that's a pipe dream.

Cheers,
Eric
