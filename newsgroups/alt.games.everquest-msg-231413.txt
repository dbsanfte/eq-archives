Could be and probably am wrong, but I was thinking that when the new UI 
came out, it was optional (that part I *KNOW* is right, as I didn't use 
it), but around the time PoP came out (maybe when WHEN it came out), they 
dropped the old UI for good.  That's the way I remember it, and only 
because I started playing shortly before Luclin came out (matter of 
weeks).
