This is true up to a point....

Mobs over level 37 (I think that is right...I know it's in the 30s)
will not always forget you. It can take several successul FDs or even
a /quit to completely clear agro. If you have 4 mobs on you and 3
clear....the fourth could chain agro the other 3 as he paths back to
you when you stand up. It can be very tough sometimes to clear agro
when fighting mobs that stand/path close together.

DoTs....If you have cast a DoT on the mob it will remember you if the
DoT ticks off more damage.

As a Monk, I can FD then pop-up and repeat every 10 seconds until I am
sure all agro is cleared. This is also how monks Feign-Pull and Feign
Split mobs. 

I am not familiar with the cast/recast time of Necro FD, but since
necros can't take much of a beating you might want to use /quit when
fighting big-uglies and things go wrong.
