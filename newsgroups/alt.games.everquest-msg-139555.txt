}I know.  That makes it *so* much easier.  Well, for the only real class

What do you mean?  Chanters don't get Sneak/Hide... :)

}Really sucky, REALLY boring quest.  Plus I managed to stumble into the 
}bar above the dock and run into some gnome who didn't like me.  Thank 
}goodness *he* was blue.  Ran into a blue one *and* a white one later, 
}and had caution enough to con first that time.  Weird thing is, that 
}gnome was apparently supposed to be in HHK only he tends to appear in 
}that bar every so often.

Lozani will be happy to take any illegible scrolls and cantrips you may 
have. :)  Fairly rare spawn in the bar.  After 6pm though, watch out for 
Lenka Stoutheart and her ogre chum.  They like Dark Elf pate`. :)

}How much do those picks cost from merchants?  The orc hatchets used for 
}a GFay quest are sold for something like 6 copper then they turn around 
}and charge somewhere around 7pp per hatchet when you want to buy em.  I 
}figured the picks would be the same, and farming em would be a royal 
}pita.

They're in the 1-2gp range from a merchant last I checked.  You may need 
about a hundred of them... about 40 per faction level, as I recall.

}Actually, not talking about the gypsies anymore.  Talking about the 
}everyday sellers in Freeport.  I'm tired of having to climb over the 
}counter everytime I have to buy more kiola sap in North Freeport :)  I 
}just cannot get that faction to move though.  Is there *one* faction 
}only that will raise them?  Because some of those merchants don't seem 
}to be on any faction at all (ie, those guys in the building you run 
}through when coming off the boat in EFree) and some of them are on four 
}or five (ie, the chicks in the pub in NFree with the brewer cask in it, 
}that bitch in the bank who won't deal with me until I squeeeeeze in 
}behind her...)

There's some variation, yep.  The pawn pick quest raises most of the 
relevant factions... Can't remember for sure on the ones you specify, I 
think those may actually be the exceptions.  But EFP is much easier for 
kiola sap making anyway.  I think the ones in the port authority building 
may be beta neutral or something.  The bank ho is probably knights of 
truth.  But she's a greedy wench anyway, so heck with her. :)
