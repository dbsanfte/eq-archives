Whining, yes.  Kiddo - no (unless you ask my wife).

In the past year, I can count on one hand the number of times that I have
died with all my toons.  Ok, the druid had a bit of bad luck last week, but
that's beside the point...so it's not dying.

I have a lot of fun with the game, I just like to vent on occasion.  I know
where the food is in Freeport (although I've always bought in the commons).
but what about the other zones that no one is using anymore?  I don't even
see guard campers anymore.

Five years on and off, screwing around, yadda yadda....although with my new
druid, I got to 30 in about 1 day played.  Soloing.

and I know the grind.

I would, however like to hear your suggestions for levelling.

say....15-30.
