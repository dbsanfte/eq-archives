}Big difference.

Very true -- and the evidence I gave only really supports the weaker 
statement. :)

I really have no problem with the idea of a creator that let random chance 
get that involved in things.  I even think that's reasonably likely.  But 
I also think that such a creator would be very unlikely to care a whit 
about what kind of trouble a particular species of monkeys gets into. :)
