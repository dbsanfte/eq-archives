Alright, just a quick clueless question here.

With the advent of the Raid XP, would it be worth it to make your
normal 6-man group into a Raid for the purposes fo gaining XP?

Does been in a raid (even of one group) crater yur XP that much, or
would you still get normal xp from the group?

Is it even possible to have a raid of one group? (or less...a duo or
trio, say?)

Thanks,
