Yes. I first thought of making a guild charity chest and donate old gear to
others outside the guild but realistically..no one will want them or they
would be in the guild.
I think attunable or pretend once equipped then no drop. I forget if that is
what attunable is quit playing around that that time. Or was it augments.
Feels rather interesting not having a clue about the UI or what keys do
what. Took me about 10 minutes to talk on a chat channel. Finally made new
window with the channel as default and filtered. Couldn't recall the /tell
command to chat to a channel. ) I digress.
One of the equipment problems is no item decay and treating as all no drop
isn't great either. Some of my best memories are getting handme downs of
rare ( well rare then) gear. Not uber overpowering gear just old and used.

Nahhh... I really hope policing is a non issue. After all why would someone
not like minded want to be part of the crew ?
