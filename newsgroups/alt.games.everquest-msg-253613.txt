Do what the other level 65 mages do......start soloing stuff to see if
you can.  Start with stuff like Phinny, Ice Burrower, Cliff Golem,
Neh'Ashirr....move up to things like Lodizal...and go from there.
You'll find out that many AA's are helpful.

Honestly though, I have a hard time believing you actually like
playing a mage.  Seems every post I've ever read of yours, on your
adventure from 1-65 as a mage has been negative.
