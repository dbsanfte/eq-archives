I think I understand what you're saying here a little better now. It
makes sense and should be seriously considered.

I was just thinking that since the monks effectiveness is being

Was just going by what I read in their "we're just people too"

Granted, but everyone else's job is geared toward either directly
affecting the mob or keeping the mob on one tank by keeping the MA
alive. The mod rodding role seems to be a bit detached from the
immediate battle for my liking. Maybe it's just personal preference.
