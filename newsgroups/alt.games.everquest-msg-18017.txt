Good paladins use mana constantly in a group; in fact I've
been in many groups where given limited enchanter
resources (chanter covering two full groups) we were
putting clarity on the paladins, while my cleric was turning
it down.  By and large I only cast heavily in a disaster,
where the med component isn't terribly useful, while they
tend to cast a good deal in every battle... and don't have
the luxury of sitting during fights like I do.

Stun, Flash of Light, Root, various Divine spells... its
really amazing what they get up to.

Last year, before the patch which made hybrid spell
casting not reset the weapon delay counter, you'd see
paladins running Divine Purpose and thats about it,
but no longer.
