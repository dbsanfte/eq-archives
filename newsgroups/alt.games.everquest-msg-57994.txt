Except that Verant has established through its network status messages
and server-wide messages that most machines hold a single zone for a
single server.

I'm pretty sure the server setup is a sort of fractal starfish. There
is a single-IP server cluster to handle logins in a load-balanced way.
The login cluster passes just enough information (probably your IP
address and the UUID that SOE gives you when you sign up for a Station
account) to the master machine (or cluster) for the "server" you log
into. That server contains or connects to a database of all the
information about your character--level, hitpoints, equiptment, last
location, etc., which it feeds to the zone servers. Besides the hints
that Verant has given from the server status messages, the fact that
individual zones can go down and be reset without upsetting the rest
of the world would seem to indicate a more modular setup, albeit with
no mirroring other than chunky disaster recovery. This would explain
why, for example, you can see your character and the login server
thinks you can login, but then dumps you out when you try to go into a
crashed zone.

Just my 2 cents and 11 years of experience.
