Correct - JM Capozzi was producer for SoL (and a poster to EQBards long
ago with much inside info).  He is now with Sigil

It's the opposite of the vicious circle - as long as they are successful
they will produce expansions, which will keep people in the game and get
new players.  Of course, if at any time the outflow of customers makes that
a bad business decision then the opposite will happen - no more expansions
and more people leaving a stagnating game.

New content for my long established and cherished characters to explore
with longtime friends > a new game with potentially fatal flaws, non of
my friends and some stranger as my avatar.

This from someone who tried several of the "EQ Killers" when they came
out.
