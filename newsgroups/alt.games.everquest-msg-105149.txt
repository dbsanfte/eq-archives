I had it once removed. The GM did it without needing a reason. That same day
I picked another one. That means you can assign yourself a new surnname even
after you've had it removed by a GM. I ended up removing that surnname
yesterday. The GM met me in the zone and removed it without a question, and
a nice smile. Nice GM. Good customer service.
