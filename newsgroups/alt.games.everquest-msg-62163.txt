If you are not a twink (no Sugar Daddy), the next non-stat bonus attire
would be something like gossamer or damask.  You can get these pretty cheap
is anyone bothers to sell them.  Your first robe will probably be a Flowing
Black Robe (FBR) that has an INT bonus.  They go for about 100pp-150pp
nowadays.
