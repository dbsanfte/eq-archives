No, I don't believe it...but then again, I don't vote any Party Line.  Eh,
ok, I'll amend that:

Helping those goddamned homeless (move them out of my neighborhood!) and
Cadillac-driving welfare people (they're all like that!) is Liberal.

Fact is, the country is moving away from social programs and anyone who says
"Whoa, wait a second, that's just not right!" gets the big ol' "Liberal"
stamped on their forehead.

Hmmm, I can't think of a good statement that Liberals make about Reps.
Someone else is likely to, though.

Silly thing is...the Democrats that "liberals" vote for also want those
"damned homeless" in someone else's yard.  While Republicans have people
they can vote for who actually espouse the bad stuff (well, "good" in their
opinion...but stuff that kinda tosses the country into the toilet) that
their constituents want, Democrats don't have that luxury.  A vote for Gore
wouldn't be a vote for the People...it'd just be a vote for HIS corporate
sponsors.  Err, I should hurry to say that I'm talking about US-level
offices...I'm sure there's plenty of good State and Local politicos of both
parties.
