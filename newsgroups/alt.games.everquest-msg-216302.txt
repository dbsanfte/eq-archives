Depending on the size of the lair I could imagine the dragon capable of
flight or not.  If we assume that the lair is too small for that dragon to
take flight from a *standing* start then we can move on to the question of
stopping a walking dragon.  If you want to suppose a dragon so immense that
8 fighters could not corner it then that dragon would also be strong enough
to stomp those fighters without a second thought.  But if you have a dragon
small enough that x number of fighters have any chance of lasting more than
10 seconds then there is also the possibility of stopping it with force or
pain.  You could also look at it as 10 fighters @350lbs = 3500 lbs > 2000
lbs
