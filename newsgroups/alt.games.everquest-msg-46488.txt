I was just zoning into GD from EW. then i never zoned in. i couldnt wait
another 5 minutes so i ctrl+alt+deleted EQ finally got out. redid the patch
did velious patch kunark patch and optional patch. then tried again same
thing happend i couldnt get in. then i did it again only tryed another char
that was in another zone. that one worked fine. so i tried the one that was
giving me trouble and it didnt work. i waited longer and it took me to a
black screen. i cntrl+alt+deleted it and it said entering world...(not
responding). entering world... is EQ when it is zoning. so i am a lil mad.
