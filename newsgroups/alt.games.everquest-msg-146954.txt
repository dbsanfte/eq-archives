No, because the mobs would be higher-level to the 51 than to the
60.  The 51 would get more AAXP per kill.

The problem with the "it's better to get them at 51" approach
is that, even if you don't raid, you're still going to have a
much easier time killing them at 60 than at 51.  Casters are
going to have, even assuming the same equipment, 20% more raw
mana from INT or WIS up to 200.  Resists, both full and partial,
are going to be limited at 60 compared to what they are at 51,
so you get more damage per spell.  And so on and so on.

Hitting 60 (or even 52 from 51) is an upgrade.  Other than some
benefit from getting run speed 1, NOTHING else you get is going
to be as worthwhile day-in and day-out as leveling.
