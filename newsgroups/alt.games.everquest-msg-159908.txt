Just for the record, it appears that Wolfie is talking about wizards
quad kiting in the "training phase" when your best (and in fact only
viable) choice is circle of force. It works, and we all do it, and it's
a great way to learn. But it's far from being as efficient as it gets.
With each circle of AoE spells the wizard gets, the damage to mana
ration keeps going up. By the mid forties, I had found that, for
soloing, if I couldn't find anything to quad, I didn't bother soloing
that day and played an alt. *NOTHING* comes close to efficiency, either
in mana or in time spent for xp gained, to quad kiting. Particularly
later on. You're also dealing with a relatively meager xp pool back at
that level, and even on single kills you can med back up fairly quickly.
With KEI at those low levels, it's nothing to speak of.

However now, (at level 57) I've got a mana pool topping out over 3.5 K.
Try medding that up from scratch, even with KEI. It takes a while. And
as for damage efficient, take a look at the Pillar line of spells and
what they do. I can do three quarters of an Ice Comet's worth of damage
to *four* mobs for less mana than it takes for a single one of my
straight DD nukes these days.

Judging the mana efficiency of wizard quad kiting based solely on the
min/max numbers you'll see in the lowbie levels using circle of force
and bonds of force (which also goes away later when you get Atol's
Spectral Shackles) is not a very good comparison for analysis.
