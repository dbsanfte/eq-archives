I don't know about Yonder, but a similar bard song, Melanie's Mellifluous Motion is
interesting to play with.

It ports you a short distance, never thru a wall, and never up.  If it ports you to a place
where you'd fall, you instead also get ported down to the ground.

This latter feature means you never end up falling to your death because of it... but it
also means you can use it as an elevator, for example I used to use it all the time in the
Crystal Caverns to go from the top to the bottom without having to hop hop hop my way
down.  I'd jump off the ledge with the song about to go off, and boom I'd end up on the
bottom floor 9 times out of 10.

The fact that you never port up, though, means that you can use it and the terrain to
control your direction of teleport with some reliability.  I've won several foot races
against higher level bards, by manuevering so that "downhill" was in the direction I was
running and having this go off.  Running east, say, I'd run up a hill and then when running
back down the other side, hit MMM, which would usually pop me eastwards and downhill a good
ways.  Run up the next hill and repeat.

Indoors, the "you don't go thru walls" thing makes this even more reliable.  Just find a
straight stretch of corridor where you are running uphill away from the mob, then use
this.  You'll either move left or right a short ways and be stopped by a wall, or you'll
move back down the slope, hopefully past the mob.  (if Yonder has a fixed TP distance so
you never come up short that will be even better, MMM could drop you randomly right in his
lap)  Hmm, I should have said "where its downhill all the way to past the mob, where you
want to be."

==============================================
Another option, much more reliable, would be to bind yourself in the corridor, run the mob
past your bind spot, then gate back.  This will work every time and put you right where you
want to be.  Better, now you can run the other way as far as you like and then gate again
to be back on the "towards the coldain" side of the mob again.

Try not to bind where there's a KOS mob spawn or wander, but in CC there's a pretty long
stretch of corridor between the mobs and the guards, should work great.  Death will still
suck a bit, of course, but at least as a wizard you will find it easy enough to get out
when you are thru kiting, just port!
