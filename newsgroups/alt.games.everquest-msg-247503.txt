Took me a minute to figure that one out. I assume you meant confiscating 
the guns? If so your right that is a better analagy. The innocent is 
still the one getting penalized though, and its still wrong.

And there is an obvious difference between buying a replacement gun and 
a replacement account... the replacement gun is pretty much equivalent 
to the original out of the box... the replacement account is possibly 
1000s of hours of work away from matching the original.
