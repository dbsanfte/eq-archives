adding more spells seems rediculous to me when no matter how many spells you
have in your spell book, you got the bottleneck of 8 spells memed at a time.
we cannot even begin to cast all the spells we currently have without
constantly swapping out spells, even 30 + level people.  Saying this is a
limitation that Verant wants to keep shows a lack of vision.  Just like
Clarity for enchanters wasn't even in the initial specifications for the
game, so is not adding new spell slots.

My preference would be to add 1 spell at certain levels so we at least
double the number of spell slots available at a specific level.  one example
of this would be to give one spell slot for every level over 52nd.  this
would give a 60th level 16 total spell slots.  this would match the addition
to other melee classes in allowing them to do disciplines.  another
possibility is to instead give it to all spell casters 25th, 30th, 35th,
40th, 45th, 50th, 55th, and 60th a new spell slot.  this would also give 8
more spell slots, but allow the younger crowd the benefit of the new spell
slots earlier.

even 1 or 2 spell slots would help some though.  I personally don't see the
game unbalancing by allowing people to be able to mem more spells.  The real
bottleneck should be the mana to cast the spells.  1 or 2 extra spell slots
is not going to throw the game out of balance.  I don't believe 8 would
either.  what it would do is allow it to make it more convenient for spell
casters, who then wouldn't have to constantly swap spells out all the time
to cast things.

My understanding is that there are some spells that have a time delay on how
long it takes before they become available.  like divine aura and boon of
garou.  these spells if memmed should probably also reduce the number of
available extra spell slots by one.  Otherwise the time limit on these
spells might not be taken into account properly.  thus if I had 2 of these
types of spells mem'ed, instead of 8 extra slots I would only have 6.  it
doesn't make sense to do this if only 1 or 2 spell slots is added.

lets view a world where you had a 10 banks of 8 slot spells you could mem.
so you sit around and mem half of them, for a total of 40 spells.  your sick
of memming spells, and don't really need the extra spell slots.  what would
be the net result of this?  you wouldn't have to swap spells in and out.
you could have the spells that take forever to mem at your fingertips for at
least one cast.  you can buff people and debuff monsters and blast away
without having to swap spells in and out.

This is mostly a client/programming issue and less of a balance issue, in my
eyes.

I presume / am guessing that monsters also have a limit of 8 spells they can
cast, and also am guessing they don't swap spells in and out.  From an AI
stand point, I think they are already limited if they cannot swap spells in
and out.   If they can swap spells, I'd be really surprised, since I never
see critters sitting down for a second to swap out spells.  redoing all the
monsters for spell casting just sounds like a ton of work, and doesn't seem
like it would add much overall to the actual game.
