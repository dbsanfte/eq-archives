Because, though they are an extremely rare, almost
mythical breed, there are some people that role-play
and wouldn't be caught dead doing such a thing.  Or
some folks would consider it more fun to go through a
minor puzzle/task instead of resorting to the shortcut of
using a disposable level 1 character.

Not that I'm one of those people - I have a rather old
memory of using a level 1 to go swimming around the
temple and killing the fish... hee hee.... though for the
life (Priests of Life?) of me I can't remember what the
quest is for!
