Didn't you read my last note to you about this? LOL!

As many have said, try a variety until you find what you like, and play it.
Most all of them are good. Some better than others. If you are sick on not
getting in groups, Clerics, Warriors, and Chanters (if you can live through
the first 20 levels) are good picks.

That has been debated to death here. Some will still say the the 50+ wiz is
still a serious bad ass.  They are still the only way to get to two of the
planes, so that's an advantage. Others will tell you that the Vellious
expansion has nerfed the wizard to the point of being useless.  I haven't
gotten there, so I don't know, but it sounds like it's never going to be easy.

I used to read Graffe's all the time when playing my wiz.  There are folks
there who will go so far as to tell you that the wizard is the ultimate solo
class and you can solo to 60.  (I personally think they say that because they
could never get into a group. LOL!)  And yes, I solo'd a LOT, and just for
that reason. It can be done, but you will spend SO much time sitting on your
ass waiting to recharge mana that it was a pretty dismal existance for me. Why
do you think my wizard is a master fisherman?
