With identify, make sure that  your cursor is holding the item that you
wanted id'd.  It took me a few to gather how to use Lyrral's ID song, and
the kicker was that I had to have myself targeted.  (Apparently I can ID
stuff other people are holding.)

ID is weird.  There are some things that you need to have id'd (the ancient
coins, the skulls and fists for iksar shamans and monks, etc) and other
things that really don't need an id, but hell, why not, you have the
capability, right?

However, I'm not sure how important it will be later on with the newest
expansion coming about.
