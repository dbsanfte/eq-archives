 Buffs are a nice thing to have. Shamans also work as fairly decent
backup healers. I'll admit they aren't the damage dealers like
warriors/rogues/monks/wizards are but if they want to be main damage
dealers I'm sure they would have played one of those classes.

 Then it sounds like they're not really enjoying the game anymore. We
have quite a few high level shamans in our guild (5 60s) and they
normally all attend raids and continue playing. I guess they are having
fun being buff monkeys. In my opinion Enchanters have it even worse,
really, in what they get to actively do during encounters.
