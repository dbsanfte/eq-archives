Hmmn - not sure, doesn't sound like a sure thing. The first thing your
opponent is going to try doing is disabling your pet:
snare/root/fear/instill doubt etc, by whatever means availiable to them in
other words.

Then they're going to come gunning for you.

You will proberly be shadowstepping like a South Parkian "right little
bastard" while piling on DoTs at any avialiable chance.

As I play an Ranger on Sullon, I would be using a low delay bow whilst
trying to close the distance. I will be hoping that a timely interupt, lag,
panic, stupidity or whatever gives me a chance to close into mellee range
where game over would occur.

If I don't make it to mellee range then I will be in a world of hurt, but at
least the bow works means you won't be untouched. Then you will be become a
target of opportunity for others at least...

Thats the textbook version, in reality I would proberly goof, root myself
and get cleaned up by your pet whilst you sit back reading a novel and
sipping tequila....Doh!
