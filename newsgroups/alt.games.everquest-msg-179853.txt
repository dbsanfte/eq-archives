A God of order that is for certain, not necessarily always military. =
There is an order in the human Christian hierarchy, which I do not know =
for certain, but it is something like Disciples > Prophets > Teachers > =
Deacons > Righteous Men > Fallen yet saved men, etc. I think that =
Disciples are the ones who go out into the world and devote their lives =
to saving souls, Prophets generally interpret conditions of various =
types in the world and apply them to scripture in order to provide =
comfort to believers and curses to non-believers. I also think that all =
Prophets are generally fallen disciples which gives them kind of an =
extra amount of burning angst and mystery from which to draw from in =
openly cursing Kings and Cities, I also believe from what I know that =
the highest rank a woman can achieve is Prophet, and I am pretty sure =
that the other Prophet is indeed a woman and may be infused with the =
spirit of Elijah, and I may be the spirit of Elias. Teachers I would =
have to assume are the preachers of churches and other teachers of =
doctrine, Deacons are the church leaders, and Righteous people are those =
who support the whole thing financially and in spirit and action by =
going to church and tithing and living the good life, Fallen yet saved =
people are those who once dedicated their lives to God but fell away =
from him who will be saved of course but not given much reward, but i'm =
sure it will be decent enough.=20

=20

I guess the interesting thing is that in 7 years there will be such a =
profound paradigm shift that everything will turn upside down, and =
generally everyone who supported Jesus even though everyone around them =
hates Jesus, will be rewarded accordingly by those ranks which I =
mentioned, here is some scripture to cogitate.



1Cor.12
[1] Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you =
ignorant.


[2] Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, =
even as ye were led.


[3] Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the =
Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus =
is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.


[4] Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.


[5] And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.


[6] And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God =
which worketh all in all.


[7] But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit =
withal.


[8] For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the =
word of knowledge by the same Spirit;


[9] To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing =
by the same Spirit;


[10] To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another =
discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another =
the interpretation of tongues:


[11] But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to =
every man severally as he will.


[12] For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members =
of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.


[13] For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be =
Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to =
drink into one Spirit.


[14] For the body is not one member, but many.


[15] If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the =
body; is it therefore not of the body?


[16] And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the =
body; is it therefore not of the body?


[17] If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole =
were hearing, where were the smelling?


[18] But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as =
it hath pleased him.


[19] And if they were all one member, where were the body?


[20] But now are they many members, yet but one body.


[21] And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor =
again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.


[22] Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more =
feeble, are necessary:


[23] And those members of the body, which we think to be less =
honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely =
parts have more abundant comeliness.


[24] For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body =
together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked:


[25] That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members =
should have the same care one for another.


[26] And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or =
one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.


[27] Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.


[28] And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily =
prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, =
helps, governments, diversities of tongues.


So basically, apostles are first and best, prophets are neither best or =
worst, teachers are great, and the rest are important.

I knew a guy briefly when I was growing up who now I know was an =
apostle, and I have never met another man like him since, and I could =
tell that he was over me and I could also tell that both of us were way =
over everyone else although me according to my gifts and him according =
to his.

I should hope that he has appreciated me taking over France if only in =
theory.

[29] Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all =
workers of miracles?

[30] Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all =
interpret?


[31] But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more =
excellent way.


I believe this is saying that if your heart desires a certain role to =
play then you will get it, I've always wanted to be one of those two end =
time prophets, although there was an evil, angry part of me (that is =
slowly abating with God's help) that wanted to be the antichrist as =
well, eventually I had to make my choice as we all do at some point in =
our lives, and I chose to serve God, and he had told me that I will be =
well rewarded and that I am well worth it.

So I guess in the future theocracy centered around around Christ, I can =
only assume that the apostles will be in charge and the prophets will be =
their advisors. I would think that the two end time prophets will have =
some special role to play and will be largely independent of the regular =
comings and going on. My guess which God seems to confirm is that one of =
the prophets will have an interim leadership role of some kind over =
America and the other will have a role over Europe, I think I will be =
the one with Europe as I am the artsy, rebellious, kinky one and the =
other is the more straightlaced, church club, coffee and donuts PTA =
going one. I plan on having a 30 year long party personally, after which =
I probably will step down as I have no interest in running Europe =
(although someone related to me by that time may). God tells me that =
being a prophet will actually be a government job title and that =
eventually I will have to work as that is a part of normal life and the =
job is basically what I am doing now which is reading the news, =
monitoring but not controlling the mass media if you are clever enough =
for that, using scripture to back up your claims and rebuking the =
unrepentant and showing real world evidence of their folly, kind of like =
being God's representative in a government and given equal importance as =
the other offices but not given any power and ultimately no =
responsibility or accountability to anyone but God. I assume there will =
be prophets in city, state, national and the world government, but God =
tells me that since evil will be utterly banished from the earth in the =
beginning, I won't usually ever have to go to work for like 300 years or =
so until it starts to gain a foothold again, which it will for the last =
time, and I doubt highly that I will have anything to do with stopping =
it in the end as I will be an old man, older than Methuselah, suppose I =
will be 1036 years old and still married to the same woman who won't =
have rejected me even when all others have, including my own mother, as =
she is mine chosen from the beginning of the world, when time is =
forcibly stopped and everyone is then judged. Most likely I will retire =
as will everyone else and probably live in this time even though I have =
never really had a home to go to here. There is nothing in space, this =
planet is the only one containing intelligent life in this universe and =
that is largely debatable at this time=20
----

I disagree. I believe that there is an order to everything. God is a =
"God of hosts". A host is an army. He is a God of military order. Even =
among humans there is an order. You have followers & leaders. I believe =
He created all things great & small. But I also believe that there is =
rank. I believe that you are more special in His eyes than a flower, a =
dog or a horses (& I love horses!!!). But I believe you are created in =
His image...likeness. We have the choice to decide where we will fall =
into rank. Just my thoughts. I also lean very heavily on the Native =
American belief that we are to respect ALL things created. Kill no more =
than you can eat, do not waste, and love all mankind as you would your =
own.

---- =20

  I usually feel more sorry for animals about things than I do humans.  =
I hate seeing a puppy or kitty dead in the road.  It makes me want to =
cry.
