I dont know why... It wasnt hard. With the little 184 pt nuke, it took
me from about level 45. Fantastic XP. KEI was enough to do it reliably,
KEI and POTG meant I had virtually zero downtime. This was pre-harmony
nerf, of course, but once pulled and snared quadding along the beach
by the (non kos) otters was trivial. Druids are EQ on easy mode. When
I occasionally misjudged I had sow and chloro up so just running ahead
and carrying on meant I fixed myself up.
