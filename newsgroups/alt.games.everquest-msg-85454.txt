With Luclin, the wisdom "cap" was raised from 200 to 255.  I had been
concentrating on AC gear so my wisdom is only 194 from a base of 130.
High level clerics in my guild say wisdom is everything for a cleric,
even at the expense of AC (not counting raids here ;)

I hate to put away my Tree Weave, but it just doesn't have any
wisdom/mana on it.  

From reading old posts, I know this was a controversial topic when the
cap was 200, but now what do people think?
