Yet again I find myself agreeing with DT. :)
KEI needs a simple level limit, why it hasnt been implemented I have
no idea, its causing sheer havoc in the low game.

First:
Think of Kei as an item with the following stats:
Flowing Thought 14 
+25 Int 
+25 Wis
Common drop off Orc pawns
Required level 1
You think thats not unbalancing?
Put simply manna regen was always the balencing factor between
melee/hybred/caster. Now thats been removed. Casters are nuts to do
anything but solo, group just slows them down.

Second:
There is NO melee Equivilant to KEI.
Doesnt exist if it did they would nerf that to hell so fast its funny.
Its playing hell with PvP also, dont have to have much imaginaton
about why, God help you if the necro, druid, mag, wizzie spots you
first, the whole group could go down WHILE said caster is killing
mobs.

So thats why it always turns to KEI.
