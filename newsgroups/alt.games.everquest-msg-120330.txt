*double* top posting fixed, but I couldn't ignore this one...

You've shoved BoF into your "seldom used" pages???!!??
/gasp
/boggle
/faint

Probably the most used spell I have besides Circle of Force and my big
nuke. You're fighting casters with high MR, so you're going to see more
resists there.

Back to your original question... you want a more effective solo
strategy? You're a post 34 wizard, for god's sakes. START QUADDING! You
have j-boots, so there's ninety percent of the battle right there. If
you dont' have your staff of Temp Flux yet, go get it.

Then get the hell out of FV and head on over to Vellious. Go to GD and
find the packs of wolves that hang out near the EW zone area. Get your
steelskin up, click on your boots, and start running around that area
clicking your staff on dire wolves until you have four chasing you.(Stay
clear of the giants during this, but they move slow so it's not hard.)
Run them in a big circle up near the walls in the NE corner to avoid
adds, until they are bunched up tight. Get ahead of them and cast BoF.
If you get any resists, target the resisting mobs in 3rd person view,
run ahead and cast again. Once all are snared, circle around to round
them up again in a bunch, and cast BoF again until you get all four
snared at once. Then just kite them along the wall casting Circle of
Force until they are all dead, or all but one. If you get one holdout
(he'll be snared and low on health so facing away) just finish him off
with a low mana nuke. (I use Garrisons).

You can go to level 39 faster than you'd believe that way. Then move
next door to EW, find the Ulthorks, and rinse/repeat.
