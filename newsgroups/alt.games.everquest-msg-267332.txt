   Welcome to group, BigMak.

   So far it's been my experience is that other than the to kill a orc
quest on the starter tutorial isle, there really doesn't seem to be much
groupage going on until one start hitting the double digits in levels.  One
can group at any age, but since it is easy to solo at these levels I think
many choose to do that.  

    In EQ2 there are four professions to choose from from the start; one of
these is Mage.  I don't know what you mean by "White Mage" or what game you
might be using that term in context with, so I can't say if it the same
same.

   Also, when you start a thread about EQII in this newsgroup, please
indicate that by putting it in the title of the thread.  Something like
"[EQII] Tealeaf on AB is a Lying Scumbag".  It newsgroup has many who only
play EQLive, and  some do not wish to have to wade through posts aimed at a
game that they do not play.

In EQII:

Tealeaf-- Ogre Priest on AB
Teacup -- Gnome Fighter on AB
