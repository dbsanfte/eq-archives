I disagree.  Players who are of the appropriate Level to obtain items,
say some of the low level items like you speak of that drop off of the
Evil Eyes in the Gorge certainly have rings that are better than +5
HPs.  But there is no reason why they couldnt sell them to low level
characters for a couple gold or silver. just like the merchant give
you.  

Because you would not use certain items that drop off a said mob
because you would naturally have better does not mean that it was
Verants intention that you GIVE them to anyone.
