The loot in a L30 dungeon is going to be interesting to less than 10%
of the PCs of that level.  Maybe less than 2%.  Same is true of a L40
dungeon.  Even if they made a brand new game that would become true
in a fairly short period of time.  Unless you made all wearable loot
except for tradeskill products NODROP, nobody is gonna care all that
much about the lesser stuff, if it has any use it'll be pharmed by
higher levels who will get 0 xp killing the mobs dropping it (ref:
Sol A, Runnyeye).

The effect is that only the "best" loot (i.e. highest level gear)
actually attracts players in numbers (gee, just the way it is now).
Loot isn't going to spread people out, it's gonna have the same
effect it has now, attracting most of the players to a handful of
zones perceived to have the best stuff.  And the lower level stuff
you put in in an attempt to "train" the players is gonna be camped
by higher level pharmers.  To minimize the "pharmer/twinker effect"
you need both NODROP loot and minimum entry requirements.  But if
you don't do this on a large scale the perceived best content will
just be monopolized by the power gamers anyway (ala the old Planes
prior to Velious).
