I found it best, when using a visa check card, to cancel my account
after subscribing. That way, when bill time comes around again, I get
a box saying "not curently subscribed." Then I can check the balance,
THEN resubscribe with my visa check card. EQ and Anarchy Online both
let you do this while still being in good standing, FFXI does not, as
I recall, nor will your character last long on FFXI ( I think 3 months
if you are still paying the dollar a month playonline fee, cancel
playonline as well and POOF, no more FFXI char.)
