I'm back for the 30 day free account activation.  I played casually for
about 1 1/2 years around 2 years ago.  About 6 months ago I reopened my
account and played a bit more, but found out I just don't have the time to
play.  So now I'm back again for 30 days.   While I probably won't be
playing again, I wanted to make sure that I didn't miss the "not to be
missed" stuff.

Because I only played casually, I never really got a chance to see a lot of
the world.  I have Kunark and Luclin, although I've seen very little of
either.  In Kunark, just Lake of Ill Omen and a few surrounding zones.  In
Luclin, I never went past the first city (can't remember its name) and the
bazaar.  I've never seen all of the original worlds either, but not really
sure if I can go to some of the remaining zones.

I want to bank all my stuff and go on a tour to see the sights.  I'm only a
level 30 enchanter so I probably won't be able to see a lot, but I can trade
clarity for SOWs and ports and use inviz as much as possible.  I'm bound in
the firepot room so I can easily travel all over the original world.  The
question is.... If you were level 30 and didn't care about dying, what would
you go see?  What are the main tourist attractions that are not to be
missed?

Thanks.
