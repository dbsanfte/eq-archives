Hehe, 5 is not so bad. Took me 2 days to get the silks, just found a group that
didnt need silks, they asked if i could loot them, then sat and buffed and DS
the group.
On the bile now, and my 47 druid can solo even the casting ancient ones, so
that not gonna be hard. Tailoring for it is piece of cake, only around 115 or
so.

The worst quest if were talking tradeskills are the 6th. Tailoring reported not
trivial at 190. I dont even plan to get mine that high (or rather, i will do
the shawl before it get that high, 167 now), ill just get stuff for 2-3 tries
and hope thats enough.

Jewelcraft not bad, for all tradeskills but tailoring its ONLY a question of
having enough money. Tailoring require some work too.
