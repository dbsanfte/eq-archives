They useful are they? I had over half a dozen in the bank becuase it sounded
like something a tradeskiller might need - but ended up selling them to
vendors becuase I never heard anyone ask for any. They were definitely
perfects too - I destroy the less than top line skins to save weight.

Hmmn - makes me wonder whether any of those gorilla hides in stonebrunt I
have been routinely destrying are worth anything either.

If your on legends, let me know.
