Because there isn't enough texture memory or developer time to give every 
item in the game a unique look visible to all others, therefore they 
implemented a way to "get a closer look". I agree with Lance, though, in 
that they made a mistake with the notification message. There is no reason 
for that.

And why exactly would you choose not to let someone inspect you?

Agreed. PvP is a special case. Then again, in some instances, people can 
already see part of your equipment, at least those items with an unique 
graphic.

That's only how you choose to interpret it. I understand it as something 
brought about by the limitations of the game engine. If every item in the 
game showed up with a distinct graphic, it would have exactly the same 
effect as inspecting, and people wouldn't call that "an invasion of 
privacy".

Again, because of texture memory constraints.
