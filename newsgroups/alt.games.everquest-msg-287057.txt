They went up as scheduled, then shortly afterwards said they had to come 
  down for a patch.  Countdown went thru and then they said the shutdown 
was cancelled  A few minutes after that, I crashed out simultaneously on 
both accounts, I assume they did go down after all.

We'll see about the half hour patch they predicted.

Observations:

Most of the new AA are SOF only, so not interesting to someone on 
Combine for quite some time to come.

One exception: Forage  Anyone can buy this, for 3 AA, to get a 50 point 
bonus to their forage skill.  For people without forage, this means a 50 
forage skill... as a gnome SK for example, or a gnome cleric for that 
matter.

On Claim there are two new items; one is Steamfists, which is an odd 
primary slot item you can click to get shoved forward a little bit, and 
then get a buff which can be cast indoors and apparantly gives you 
something similar to JBoot run speed... useless to me as I already have 
Run 4

The other is actually three items:

One is something that looks like a misty thicket picnic but which seems 
to be something you trade in in a SOF zone for some reward, dunno what.

The second, a LON booster pack

The third, a clicky sparkly aura item

Also, skill caps were raised on a few skills, in particular I noticed my 
  Meditation skill on my SK has a much higher cap.  Offensive/melee 
skills didn't seem to go up, someone in guild chat said dodge/parry did 
but I didn't get around to checking before the crash

I have something like 11/18 of the new HT AA, and didn't get any AA 
back... which makes sense given that I havent put a single point into 
this broken SK mechanic, and don't currently intend to pour any into the 
new version.

Didn't really get to look at my cleric before the crash at all, so no 
idea what if any changes went on there... would be nice to see higher 
med cap and dodge/parry caps there too.
