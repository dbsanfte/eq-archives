Tell me about it. Went on Vox raid last night. Died before I realized I
was dying. Health bar looked like it was around half. (damn lag) so I
turned to run to the healers outside and ... LOADING. PLEASE WAIT.
*sigh*.

Either 38 or 39. I've been pulling ahead a bit, since she's been
focusing on tradeskills for the shawls (she's wearing number six now)
and I've been ... well... quadding.

Turned out to be a total non issue. And I know a lot of the other shawl
questers are going to /rude me when I say this, but the eggs were a
breeze. A 55 druid friend who I've helped a lot with my Troll, came to
help me hunt snow griffons, as they are VERY hard for me to solo and I
can't track. We got four eggs in five griffons. Took less than fifteen
minutes and two bars of mana.

Oh, YEAH, baby! Of course, if it's ID III then I won't be able to
benefit from that part until I hit 49, but that won't be long anyway.
And in the meantime it still looks like a great item. Wonder what I can
sell my Shissar Dagger for once I get it? Hrmmm..
