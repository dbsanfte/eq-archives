Having played both games, I can ay that that statment is completely and
utterly false. AC and AC2 are WORLDS apart in both tech used, and game play.
AC is a traight skil based classless system, whereas AC2 is a skill tree
based game ala Diablo 2. Crafting in AC is VERY limited in usefulness and
scope, whereas AC2 is reportedly much better in that regard.

No, AC2 is a revolutionary, rather than evolutionary change from the orignal
AC.


Now, all that being said, of the games the OP listed I woudl still say that
EQ would be his best choice.
