Eh.  The idea was to appeal to more socializer-types by giving them
noncombat ways to play in the game.  For them, the Crafter *was* their
main.

It still does, from what I've heard:  time spent crafting to increase
your 'artisan' levels is time you're not spending to increase your
'adventuring'  levels.  The main bonus I see is, the process is
interesting enough to have some appeal on it's own and time-consuming
enough that developing a crafter takes away from developing an
adventurer regardless of whether you're doing it on a main or a mule.

UO *sort* of had that as well, except that in UO there was a clear
top-end for character development:  once you've maxed your chosen 7
skills (or whatever combination of points you chose instead of
7-at-max,) you don't need to sink any more time into 'levelling' him. 

EQ seems to have no clear top-end for character development;
level-based systems can always just tack on more levels.
