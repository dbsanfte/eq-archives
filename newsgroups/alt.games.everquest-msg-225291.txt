Burnout has haste and AC.
Swift Like The Wind is a 'pure' haste, only has haste.  All shaman haste is
'pure' haste, but not all enchanter haste.
Augmentation has haste and AC.

Burnout and Swifties can be cast on the same pet, the pet will get the
benefit of whichever haste is faster.  The haste will not be additive.
Burnout and Aug can't be cast on the same pet, the AC buffs bounce.
Depending on which Burnout you use, the Aug may or may not be overwritten
(Aug is a level 29 spell, try it with the pre-29 Burnout and I'll bet it
bounces).
