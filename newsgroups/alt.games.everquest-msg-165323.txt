On the contrary, the first several camps can be done by someone in their 30s or
40s as a exp group exercise, which turns the interminable wait killing green
after green... and those at what, 15 minute intervals?  ...  into a serious
profitable day or three.  I certainly wish I'd done Lord Bergurgle and
whatsisname in Sol A long before I did, because thats several wasted days which
COULD have been decent exp and hey, even decent loot (quite a lot of FS drops and
there's a vendor in zone to keep turning it into cash for you)

While its possible to complete the entire quest in under a week at high levels,
its also possible for it to be, as is apparantly the intent, a quest of epic
proportions, begun young and worked on over the months as you level up and gain
in power.  Since eventually every cleric will want their epic, I can't think of
any reason not to start the quest as soon as its reasonable to do so, while the
early portions are still interesting.
