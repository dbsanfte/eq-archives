That is a good site to help you get started, however keep in mind that this
writer is pretty opinionated about the usefullness of some spells and in
many cases he is completely wrong.  There are some other good necro websites
with forums that might be helpful.

Necro is a pet class and they get a pet starting at level 1.  Even at that
low level you will find that having a pet is very helpful.  There is a quest
in Paineel for Erudite Necros that allow you to get your pet spell for free
and there might be a similiar spell for DE necros but I'm not sure because I
have never played one.

Also, check Castersrealm for information on Necro spells.  They are listed
there by level and by clicking on the spell you can get more information
about it.
