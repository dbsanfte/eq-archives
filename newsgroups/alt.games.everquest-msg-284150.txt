So, on advice recieved here, I blew off my plans to use fast low DPS 
weapons to skill up on, and plans to solo or even play second tank; 
instead I got what appeared to be the best "threat" weapon I could find, 
which is to say the one with the best ratio, and continued to tank for 
groups as per normal.

It appears reports are correct, my aggro is based on the threat my 
weapons pose and the number of swings I take with it, my ability to get 
and hold aggro went up rather than down despite the fact that early on I 
could hardly hit the broad side of an orc pawn.

I went and plunked 50 training points into 2hs so I'd stop embarassing 
myself completely, then went back to grouping.  Although it moves in 
fits, a few points over the run of a fight or two, then not at all over 
several others, then two off one (double attack) swing... it did move, 
till at 30 I'm at around 120 skill.

I'm sure it would be faster to cap the skill out using a faster weapon, 
but I experimented with doing so and found, just as people said here, 
that it became noticably more difficult to hold aggro with a crappy 
ratio weapon.

It appears I'm incorrect about the actual ratio formula, Graeme posted 
this one which I now recall from discussions about this in the distant past:

(2 x damage + bonus) / delay

So I'll have to take a look again for comparisons sake.

At 24 I had no damage bonus at all, I don't think it appeared until I 
hit 28 (I wasn't monitoring closely, so there may have been one a level 
or two earlier, or perhaps there was one for really slow weapons and not 
for faster ones.  At 28, most weapons showed a bonus of one, while the 
weapon I ended up buying showed a bonus of 6 (yeah, its pretty slow)

Another thought is that there's a damage cap, particularly at lower 
levels, this would, I suppose, mean that the damage portion of the 
weapon should be artificially reduced in that formula until you level 
past the cap?

For example, would a 30/40 weapon in the hands of someone who can only 
hit for a maximum of 20 count the same as a 10/40 weapon, and thus be 
inferior to a 10/30 weapon?

Thinking about that further though, since the aggro is based on 
potential damage, would the 30/40 weapon be higher aggro than a 10/20 
weapon despite producing much less actual DPS under the circumstances, 
or does the aggro formula know about the damage cap?
