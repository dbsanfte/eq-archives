Well, I was just over 4 blue into 60, took a death and was just an RCH 
from 60.  I think 2 or 3 kills before that death and I would have kept 60.  
Of course the 3-4 deaths playing with Vindi have knocked my exp down a 
notch, but it comes fast now.  I've not minded dying before, I expect I'll 
mind it even less now, since the AA skills don't add that much for a bard, 
at least not right off the bat.  Yeah, run speed will be nice for pulling 
in dungeons, but the damn casters get all pissy when I start pulling.
