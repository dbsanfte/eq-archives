The economy, there would be none. part of the economy is players
selling and trading, meaning that X item in the bazaar can be sold for
84,000 plat if a player selects to sell it for that amount.

Even if they did make it so only NPC/bazaar vendors could take money
transactions, people on yantis and such would get around it by setting
up a bazaar vendor who sold 5 spiderling silk to you for 84 k of your
plat, after you sent them real money.

So it would just be horrible for any players wanting to sell stuff the
old fashioned way, while it would not stop Yantis type sales.
