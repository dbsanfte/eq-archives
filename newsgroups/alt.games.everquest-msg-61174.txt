Hard to help without knowing what cash you have to spend, but here goes:

>Weapon = Mith Two Handed Sword

Mace of Shadowed Souls (MoSS) is dead cheap by now, and a sizeable
upgrade if you can get alternate haste (FBSS, Sash of Dragonborn etc.)

A new weapon (or weapon/shield combo) and different haste are your PRIME
upgrade slots IMO

>
>Face =  Lizardskin Tribal Mask

Get Fine Plate for more AC

>Neck = Ringmail Neckplate

Get Fine Plate for more AC
Spider Fur, Rygorr, or Sentry armour also pretty good here I think

>R Ear = Obsidian Bead Hoop
>L Ear = Gold Ear Stud

Sarnak earrings (ac5 str6) if you're around Overthere hunting. 
Velium black sapphire (ac2 35hp 25mana) if you've got a couple of k for
a pair
Even the old earrings from Mistmoore (forget stats/name) have AC and
would benefit you more - prolly being given away on older servers
Some playermade resist jewellery even has AC


>R finger = Adamantite Band
>L Finger = Adamantite Band

GET SOME AC!!!
2 x Vel Fire Opal (ac6 65hp) if you can afford them - should be well
under 1k for two
Jagged bands (AC5 str5 I think) if you're poor - 20pp each or something

>R Wrist = Darkforge Bracer
>L Wrist = Giant Scalemail Bracer
>Arms = Darkforge Vambraces
>Hands = Darkforge Gauntlets
>Head = Drakforge Helmet
>Chest = Darkforge Breastplate
>Legs = Darkforge Greaves
>Feet = Darkforge Boots

Good for now, but getting old. Look out for cheap upgrades

>Sholder = Bloodstained Mantel

Tattered Mantle (erm... AC13 some hp and resists I think?) dirt cheap
and common

>Back = Small Banded Cloak

Fine plate if you can find it, Spider fur, any AC upgrade

>Waist = A Think Leather Apron

Haste if possible (see above)

>
>Any idears on what I should change

Generally, ditch the stuff with little or no AC. You will notice a
significant difference with a little cash outlay in the above areas.
