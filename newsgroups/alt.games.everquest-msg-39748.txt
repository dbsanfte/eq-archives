You are correct here. TCC in concept is making the statement that only low level
players have the right to camp that nice item in that low level zone. Those
against the TCC are stating that EVERYONE should have the right to camp that nice
item in that low level zone. Those against the TCC are against that favortism and
monoliplization that the TCC clearly attempts to make.

And the bigger problem is that even though the TCC is trying to make a statement
that only low level players have the right to camp a nice item in a low level
zone (which we believe is wrong), it fails to follow through with it. What it
really does is state that those truly dedicated farmers who have multiple
accounts or decent size guilds or a large number of dispersed twinks are the
people who have the right to camp that nice item in that low level zone. It gives
the rights of camping to the lowest and dirties forms of farmers while keeping
the truly honest ones (those that only want what they will use themselves) from
achieving their goal. So you see, not only does it fail to do what it was
supposed to do even though that is wrong, it further rewards the very people that
it was most thought of to stop by reducing those worse offenders' competition.
