Ok, hour and a half instead of multiple hours.  I overstated it.  Not 
five minutes, though.  Repeatedly, for an extended period of time, and 
despite reboots and so on.

It was a problem with the patch at the time is a good answer, adding 
that many other people were having it at the time an even better one.

However, Your response, rather than to tender this information, was to 
instead jump down the poor lad's throat over something he didn't do, 
which was to ask about the sort of message you -normally- get when a 
patch is on.

I think I'm a bit sensitive about this sort of thing at the moment, 
because the same sort of thing has happened to me twice in the past few 
days, one person jumping all over me in the AGE chat channel when I 
mentioned that I could confirm the mage pet canni thing was live 
(telling me if I'd read the patch message I'd have known that, when my 
point was that indeed the patch message was correct... which they 
sometimes aren't), the second where I was accused again of not reading a 
notice, this time about the setup for discord which explained how the 
server is a contest, when the text of my message clearly referred to the 
contest nature of the server.

It looks to me like you didn't read the OP's complaint thouroughly, 
piled into him for the capital crime of griping about the way the game 
fails to properly tell you whats going on when a patch is happening 
(which, by the way, I have objected strenuously to ever since they 
changed the way it works so you can't tell if a patch is on or if the 
login is merely congested- two situations with radically different 
courses of action indicated)... and now instead of backing off when 
called on it, you quibble over "hours" versus "90 minutes".. and 
helpfully volunteer that you were actually aware of the problem he was 
experiencing, and knew it to be different from the run of the mill, 
which would have made a real response from you at the time informative 
and helpful.

Not, admittedly, that thats your normal style or anything.  I hear you 
are nicer in game though.

Splendid
Meaner in game
