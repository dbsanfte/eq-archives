Was wondering from the way it was all listed if mabey it was more of an
offensive and a defensive/utility choice, never even crossed my mind it
might have to do with diety (is there even diety selection in eq2?) or plain
old good guy/bad guy choices. Either way.. I'll be going with what I know
best in eq2... mage, can't get enough "Goner's" to make me give up on the
class lol.
