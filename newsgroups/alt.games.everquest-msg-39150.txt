I hate to agree with Sang on anything, but he's absoultely right here.
The PvE game, at least, is now much easier than it was even a year ago.

Loss of XP penalties sped up levelling a lot, but just the addition of
good hunting areas was enough to make it easier to level up (a good
thing IMO - the days when 40+ meant ONLY SolB, LGuk, or city guards were
worthwhile were not pleasant).

Then the insane loot upgrade with Kunark and Velous probably doubled the
power of the average group.  It's now the case that an industrious L30
or a twinked L15 will often have equipment better than a pre-kunark L50.

The nerfs have been far less than the upgrades.  Which is the thing that
makes them most annoying, actually.  It would be far better not to
over-upgrade and therefore not to have to nerf in the first place.
