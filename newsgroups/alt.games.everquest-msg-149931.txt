    Monk gear is good for that. You can really buy your way to some
exceptional stuff if you have the cash.

    If you know exactly what pieces you want, do searches in The Bazaar for
the components. For most TS quests you can get half the items for the quest
there for 50 pp or so, leaving you with just one mob to camp. The Safehouse
also has a ton of information on what pops where if you can sift through the
monster thread.

    No kidding. When I upgraded to the Acrylia Reinforced I stopped wearing
a Lockjaw Tunic. Two expansions, and the best chest item for low to mid end
was still off a gator in Oasis.

    The mobs I kill at level 40 seem to have difficulty hitting 940 AC. ;-)
I'll eventually get over 1 K - I don't think he's even quite capped level 40
DEF yet.

    Yeah, I've been watching for cheap Iksar Hide Boots too but I still
haven't seen them dip low enough for me to feel I'd be getting value. This
is one slot where the tradeoff between AC, stats, and weight is very well
balanced across twink gear. Well, not if you count those Barbed Dragonscale
things but I'm not blowing that much cash!

    I have yet to see a tunic drop. Even if I did manage to get one, saving
up the mind worm hides for it while not making the other pieces I have in
the bank would be tough. ;-) If I was made of money I'd get a Bracelet of
Fortitude, but I'm not made of money.
