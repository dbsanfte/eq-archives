I have the same outlook on the fog. THE REAL world is not this foggy in ANY
part of it. and the entire outdoor real world is not littered in fog, like
in the game.
There is rarely any fog where im at for example, and im near water!! (early
mornings, late late late at night if the humidity and such are right, there
will be fog)


they should have seasons in eq... the worst of the worst when it comes to
fog and thunder storms do not last year round, down here, in the summer it
storms every day, for like 10-15 minutes(its a real bitch of a storm,
though) and sometimes lasts longer. but during winter and such... not much,
certainly not daily.


as far as the sound, I got tired of it too, I particularly got tired of the
enviromental sounds in pok and other places STILL PLAYING with enviromental
sound turned off. so now sound is completely disabled.


and as long as im bitching.. :)

my wood elf bard still tries to auto duck, even tho i've turned that
"feature" off.
