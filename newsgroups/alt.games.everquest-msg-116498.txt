Merchants won't agro you directly, but they are social, this is why you were
attacked, you ran by her, most likely with a dervish chasing you, and she
helped her friend.  This is also why I was attacked in Rivervale by the
newspaper lady, she was social with the guards that attacked me because I
had lower faction than the newbie that hit me in a duel.
