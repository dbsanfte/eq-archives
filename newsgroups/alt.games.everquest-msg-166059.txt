He procs a stun, I believe.    Or at least so my "You have resisted"
messages tell me.

Malaise is a resistance debuff, and cannot be cured.

At 43 you're going to have a  hell of a time soloing this one, even if he is
green.   He is a massive undercon.  I saw some mid 50's or higher shamans
and druids dying to him.

As Dennis said though... he's no problem for anyone at 60, and you do not
need the remove curse spell he drops (very rarely) until you are killing
Luclin raid mobs.
