Take for example, level 51, Pillar of Frost, 755 to 800 for 325 mana on 
up to four targets.  Compare to level 53, Inferno of Al'Crapbor, 750 to 
800 for 625 mana, on up to 5 targets.  Both spells have a -10 resist 
adjust.

Assuuming max damage (at level 60 for both), no resists, against the most 
mobs possible, that is still 800x4=3200 damage for 325 mana versus 800x5=
4000 damage for 625 mana.  That's a ratio of 9.85 to 1 for pillar, or a 
ratio of 6.4 to 1 for Inferno.  Which one would you use?

Even if your pillar hits only 3 targets, that's still 2400/325=7.38 to 
one damage to mana ratio.

There is a reason that those spells are nicknamed as they are.
