Bazzar zone should make prices dip AND people buy far more items. Are
you going to hang around in EC auctioning to buy a jade prod in which
case people are going to gouge you or find my happy dwarf vendor all
in yellow fine steel plate on the tribunal server while I'm sleepy
time bye bye and she has one for sale for like 700 plat?

The only problem is that so many people will go 'vendor' there that
there could be like 2,000 people in that zone. I mean, verant actually
INTENDS that you'll be afk or sleeping when set up as a vendor. So
anyone who does not have toll phone or has cable connections (everyone
non euro basically) will be able to be a vendor.. it will be NUTS.

I see that having a large impact. Horses I don't think will have a
super large impact. People thought tboots would but they don't.
Only the very rich who blow money like drunken sailors on their gear
and gear for their twinks already will feel they can afford the 9 k
for a horse.
