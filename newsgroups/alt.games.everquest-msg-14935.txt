Having spend a couple levels in Najena, I was repeatedly struck by the
idiotic things some mobs say.  In this case, it's the elementals that
you find stationed all over the top floor, and some even down lower.
Whe I first attack them, they all say, "Time to die, Jakugg."  Ok, fine.
You're going to try to kill me. Makes perfect sense.
   *Then* after the first round of blows is exchanged, they follow it up
with, "I'll teach you to interfere with me, Jakugg!"
   Ummmmm......... excuse me. "Interfere" with you? I've been running
around this dungeon for the last two hours and you've done nothing but
sit here on your fat ass like you were asleep.  I only attacked to see
if you were a statue or not.  What exactly is this master fucking plan I
seem to be "interfering" with?
