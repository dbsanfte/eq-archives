So what are Woody and Buzz Lightyear?  Computer generated character
following a scripted act.  Hand Animated is practically dead, most
animation is now done by computer control.

Assuming you will grant me that computer generated characters following
a script are indeed still toons, then what if we get good enough at
generating
them on the fly that we can have "actors" doing the voice and controlling
movement live following a script?  Say performing Hamlet with a computer
controlled ghost?

OK, how about if we ditch the script and do some improv, still controlling
CGI on the fly, a "porky and daffy" version  of "who's line is it anyway"

I put it to you that the central determining factor of whether something
is a "toon" is that it is a rendered animation capable of performing at
the animator's whim, regardless of the tools used to create it, or whether
or not a script is followed.

Further, I put it to you that although we have a limited control over
these characters, that they do fit those qualifications closely enough
that even if you find some fine line being crossed, using the expression
as a nickname is certainly within reason.

PS I put it to you further that early versions of Tinkerbell, in live
performances of Peter Pan, were in fact Toons as well, a hand
animated visual representation of something not existing in  the
real world and bearing no visual relationship to the actor performing
the part... in this case a spotlight and someone with some bells to
jingle.
