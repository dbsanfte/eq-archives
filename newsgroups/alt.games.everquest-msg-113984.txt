Who cares' what EQ's policy is - you need to get onto your bank. Once a
transaction is questioned the responsibility of proving the legitimacy of
the transactions rests with them and if they do not <prove> it to be valid -
then the balance will be TAKEN from them.

You have rights with a court of law - not with your bank or tax department
(IRS for you fellas). We should all be thankful for being on this end of
credit card transactions - the other side is a relative nightmare.
