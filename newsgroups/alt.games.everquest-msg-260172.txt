What a great idea... except that its not a new one. Hell.. I even 
*thought* they were doing that with PoP when it was first announced. I 
thought PoP AA, etc was only going to be active in the planes. So that 
the increased power you could accumulate in the planes would not 
trivialize pre-existing content. 

I'm pleased to hear that someone (FF11) has tried it. Has it been 
successful do you think?

Best to prevent that too, imo.
