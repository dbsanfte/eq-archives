What, you mean the one that had the Ottoman Empire siding with the regime
that butchered the Jews?  Maybe we should have killed 6 million people from
every nation in the axis powers just to hammer the point home?  So, some
formerly arab lands was lost... stuff like that happens when you loose a
war.

Speaking of loosing a war, let's not forget that three of Isreal's
"neighbors" decided to invade them.  That's why Isreal's bigger than it was
to start with.  I'm sure that's all nice and acceptable in your book,
though.

�Q� is right, even though you don't want to admit it.  It's like the Moody
Blues wrote:  "there's none so blind as those who will not see."
