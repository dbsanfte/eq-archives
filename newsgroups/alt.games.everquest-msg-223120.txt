I'm not sure if anyone has ever posted something like this but here
goes.

I wanted to thank all of you that watch these groups and post
information here. This board has been, by far, one of the most
informative sites outside of my favorites
(http://everquest.allakhazam.com/ , http://eq.crgaming.com/ , and of
course http://www.eqdruids.com/ , [Because I'm a Druid, mostly, in
game]).

Thank you to everyone that posts here... If you read this and want to
thank the great people that make up all the postings here please reply
to this tread and post your praise.
