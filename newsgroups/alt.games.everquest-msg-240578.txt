Granted, but I think it makes it pointless to ask what -he- would have 
done, when he's said the only reasonably available option is the mega-zerg 
that was used.  So therefore, obviously, he would have zerged it too...

A more appropriate approach might be showing evidence of RZ guilds -not- 
zerging, which I can't imagine would be all that difficult, or simply 
killfiling his vitriolic butt until he goes away or grows up.
