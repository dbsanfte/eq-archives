I asked a straightforward and innocent question, which implied 
nothing with respect to your actions. A question, nothing more, 
nothing less.

I was immediately jumped on by many, some of whom displayed 
the intelligence of a troglodyte, impugning motives to my question, 
challenging my integrity, maturity, intellect,  and offering advice to 
STFU etc. I have not posted a _single_ statement with respect to 
this except as a response to posts directly aimed at me. It could be
argued that I should have simply let it go, but I'm sorry perhaps
in my next life I'll come back as Ghandi.

The fact is that there was nothing ungrammatical, contradictory 
or illogical in my question. The question parsed perfectly.

The answer is simple, because I've been repeatedly challenged over 
and over on it. If there was any doubt as to the validity of my use
of the word I would have apologized, clarified my intent, and moved
on. Why don't you ask why so many have chosen to make it an issue ?
My posts haven't been a series of soliloquies--it takes two [ or more ] 
to tango.

Why don't you ask why in light of the fact that I've repeatedly stated I
think the person should have been reported and that he did utter a 
threat, we end up searching people for bombs in a theater and the
posts continue ?

Don't take this as a ' Oh whoa is me--the bad people are picking on
me " post--because it's not. I'm willing to defend my position until 
Hell freezes over, and will--although I'd rather not have to.

Jim
