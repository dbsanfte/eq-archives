Got in a little POD group last night with my shaman, and I'm
still trying to shake off the aftereffects.

First its

50 shaman (me)
52 warrior
51 mage
49 chanter
52 rogue

For some reason, warrior is puller.

She brings in one rat, I have serious trouble slowing it and we
get beat up pretty bad, but finally slow sticks and we manage to
pull it out; close but it worked.  Immediately half the group
wants to leave, go do something easier.  We talk them into
staying, now we know better and can improve our tactics.  I can't
believe they wanted to give up after one success!

Next the warrior pulls in two mobs.  Mez one, we cry.  Oh, I
forgot says the chanter, who spends most of the fight memming mez
apparantly.  I'm now using Malosi and getting slow stuck pretty
well, this fight, despite two mobs, doesn't kick our butts nearly
as bad as the other one with only one mob!

Now we pull one or two at a time and do pretty well, with chanter
mezzing, only trouble is if I dont' get lucky with slow early on
things can go south fast; at one point the warrior ends up dead
because I can't stick a slow to save her life... then we get mob
slowed and kill them with pets and kiting.  I log in cleric, rez
warrior, Virtue everyone, and go back to shaman.

We pull for a while longer, exp is really quite poor considering
we are supposed to have 5 man bonus and are killing yellow to me
mobs in a POP zone; I get better killing a mix of dark blue and
light blue in COM solo or with a partner!

Then we add in a druid.  I announce that I'm happy not to be
healer anymore, I'll be devoting myself to malosi and slow and
pet.  Well, this plan doesn't work out at all, druid doesn't seem
to heal or something, but now the warrior's HP bar plummets and
goes to purple each pull while I try and land malosi and slow;
its bad luck that I'm seeing a few resists compared to how things
went on earlier pulls, but all we'd need would be a few GHeals to
stay afloat, and the druid is high enough to do better than that!

Well, I rez the warrior a couple more times, and we decide to
break up the group, they run off to Chardok or something and I go
do some quest stuff while the warrior logs out in frustration.

Repeatedly during the time we were together some of them kept
asking about chardok... yes, I think chardok would be pretty
good, but not with a chanter who's at all dubious; we never had
more than one add and still we didn't get the right one mezzed at
least half the time.  With no real healer... shaman is still
using level 19 cleric spell as a heal, I don't see handling the
crowds of chardok without excellent mezzing and teamwork.  When
the druid came along I might have been convinced, except as it
turns out the druid was worse at healing than I was (admittedly I
have 65 levels worth of cleric under my belt so I have an idea
how healing works)

I don't suppose I have a point here, other than to remind myself
that despite the new group bonus, sometimes soloing is still
better than the "any random assortment" plan.

Paax

PS don't ask me why the warrior didn't just kite the mobs around
until slow stuck, either, cause I don't know.
