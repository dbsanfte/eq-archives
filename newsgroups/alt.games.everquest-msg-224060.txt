Puts me in mind of the phrase "Looting is working as intended"  for those
that remember that.

Basicly, a paladin looted his body by right clicking on the items.  One of
the items went into his weapon slot, and when it came time to click his epic
weapon, there were no more slots to put it in.  Since a no drop item cannot
fall to the ground, the item was destroyed.   The official GM response,
after multiple e-mails... "Looting is working as intended."

The final resolution didn't come for several weeks, until in an interview,
one of the game websites (ah for the good ol' days, with Lum the Mad : ) )
asked (I forget if it was John Smedley, or Brad McQuaid.) exactly what was
meant by "Looting is working as intended."   He was essentially shocked to
hear how the situation had been handled.  Within a few days, the paladin had
his weapon restored, and the next patch had a change, "Looting no drop items
when you are out of room will now place the item on your cursor, instead of
destroying it."

So basicly, if e-mails aren't working for you, begin phone calls.  Keep
talking and keep talking to someone higher up.   You can get this fixed.
