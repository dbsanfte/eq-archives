Sorry, I should have been more clear.  You can stack shawl and SCRM for 
70%.  I was meaning to say you can get as high as 50% (but not more) with 
AA alone.  I have heard (but not personally verified) that you can get to 
75%, with SCRM and Chrononostrum, and there are hints in lucy that there 
may be 30% items in the works, which could push it to 80%.
