Yeah, no shit man. Makes me really think hard as to whether or not to even
keep playing my 51 Wizard, now that I know I'm fucked. I suppose Rogues will
still have Assassinate? Gee, that's not bullshit or anything. We wizards
have SHIT for HP, SHIT for melee ability, and our nukes are marginal against
big mobs. So now we get our one "Homerun hitter" taken away. Well that's
just great. Now all we can look forward to is being mages without pets.
Think I'll start a Druid. =(
