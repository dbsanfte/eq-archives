Stun
Root
Snare
Canni IV
Fear
Mez
Yaulp VI
Stoicism

While the other spell lists I've seen are interesting, they'd be pretty
useless at level one, I tried to go with spells with casting costs so low
that they'd be affordable nearly from the start.

Stun and Root are very cheap highly effective spells that my cleric was
still casting into his 60s.  Snare, well, I'd be tempted to hold out for
Ensnare, but the cost is higher and much of the time you kill things before
they outlive Snare.  Canni IV, well, that I'm not sure of.  I took it as its
the highest level canni and AFAIK has no casting cost... but how big is it?
If its too large you won't be able to use it at low levels because doing so
would kill you outright!  So maybe III... II is only 66 hp per, so it really
wouldn't be a problem but its sure a pain to keep chain clicking it
constantly and a larger one wouldn't be out of order unless the hp cost is
really high.  Fear is also cheap and effective, works on all targets.  Mez
(single target version) is also cheap and effective, but I do worry at very
high levels that it will no longer stick.  Yaulp VI is a great buff, giving
AC, Haste, Dex, and Mana regen, at a very low operating cost (in fact its a
net gain), any hybrid running this spell continuously would be a happy
camper if he's lacking regular haste.  I'd consider a "real" haste, but
picking a really good one would mean not being able to cast it for half your
life, plus its easy enough to get buffs.  Stoicism is the one that gave me
the most pause; its too expensive to cast early on, but get thru the first
10 levels or so and you'd have canni/torpor style mana and HP supply, which
is difficult indeed to beat, plus stoicism is a decent enough heal for
others.

I already see a flaw with my lineup; I've put in a mana supply and a HP
supply, but I neglected to put in a mana sink!  Where am I going to spend
all that mana I so carefully supplied myself with?  I need a spell that eats
mana in a useful way but doesn't cost too much to be castable.

I guess swap the fear for a slow, but the flaw with that is that any useful
slow costs too much for use at low levels, and any cheap slow will be
desperately outdated by the time you get higher levels.  Fear, stun, root,
and snare remain useful from 1 to 65, and mez nearly so.

Well it bears thinking about
