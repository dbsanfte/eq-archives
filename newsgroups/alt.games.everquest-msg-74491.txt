I don't join a group with someone who acts like an ass.  This encompasses 
/shouting or /oocing garbage all the time or doing anything else stupid.  
If they are an idiot in one way, they're an idiot thru and thru.  Idiots 
make for an unpleasant gaming experience and sometimes unnecessary deaths.  
I play the game for fun and that diminishes when I'm in close proximity to 
an idiot.  If someone in my group is acting like an ass, and small nudges 
don't fix them, I send a tell to the leader that they go or I go, and I 
don't care which.  100% of the time, it is them.  Always.  If I am the 
leader, I send them a tell if nudges don't work, explaining that their 
behavior is out of hand and that they need to fix it or leave.  Simple 
enough.

Once you find some people that you -love- to group with, make a good effort 
to keep grouping with them.  My current experiences with this are detailed 
below.

I learned -here-.  My very first char was a wizard.  I grouped continually 
with a Bard and a Mage.  Horrible group, but we had a blast.  I had no 
friggin' clue how to play my wizard.  When Jazz started asking questions 
about his new Wiz, I learned a TON on how to play my wizard.  But, I moved 
to a different server to be with a bud, so I haven't touched that char in 
forever, and never will again.

When I realized what a great resource this NG was, I started compiling info 
on Chanters and started one from my mule when my Necro was getting boring.  
He became my main, quickly.  Until last night, he was my highest level 
char.  Now, he's tied with my warrior.  While I played my Chanter, I read 
every thread on warriors, and paid special attention to the people on here 
that I know play them and know what the Hell they are talking about.  My 
warrior dinged 35 last night because of the great info I have learned here.  
I know more about aggro, taunting, assisting, pulling, keeping the Cleric 
alive, etc. than I could have ever learned on my own.  A big thanks to all 
the contributers here.

> #3) And is it -worth- it, so far as experience and cash goes?

I put "having fun" above both of those.  But, I have found the perfect 
place and perfect people.  I started grouping Draglorvin with a pair of 
people ( Nightingael [ CLC ] and Ughhies [ WAR ] ) back at the Sarnak Fort 
in tLoIO.  They are great players, have great personalities, and can play 
while they talk.  No loot bickering, no -anything- to slow down the EXP.  
They told me they were going to move to Dalnirs when they hit 30 and wanted 
me to join them.  I was level 29, and they hadn't logged on for some days, 
so I moved to the Giant Fort in FM.  I was getting -OK- EXP and met a few 
decent people, and then saw them logged on and in Dalnirs.  Sent them a 
tell, asked them where the Hell Dalnirs -was-, and got my ass there.

We grouped and kicked serious ass.  Just the 3 of us.  As people would 
wander into Dalnirs, we'd get them in the group, because we don't believe 
in denying anyone a group ( unless they are an aforementioned idiot - case 
in point, an idiot Iksar Warrior named Therax - no one in Dalnirs will 
group with him, at least not more than once ).  I got 5 levels this weekend 
with Draglorvin, and that's with playing my Chanter some to help some 
guild-mates and doing a little questing.  The EXP in Dalnirs is -insane- 
with a good group, and safe to boot ( again, with a good group ).  Most of 
the time, we had 5-6 people in the group, and -never- stopped pulling, 
except when we ended up with 3+ mobs, usually casters, and the CLC would go 
under 30 mana.  Then, we would just pull guaranteed singles while she 
medded.  Getting a blue bubble every 4-7 minutes should be illegal at level 
34.  Unfortunately, at 35, it's slowing down.  Not sure where we are going 
to go next.  In the 5 levels, I pulled down over 700 plat, including items.    
That's probably not a lot, but it will buy me a new present, I'm sure.

I finally got a Sap of Piety.  I rolled a 182, and was happy.  Then, one 
bard rolled a 198.  OOf.  To top that, the other bard rolled a 199 on it.  
Ow.  She gave it to me ( she has a 60 Necro and 29k in the bank, she said 
).  Very nice lady.
