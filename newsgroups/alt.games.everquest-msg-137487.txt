My personal take on PvP in Shadowbane is as follows:

PvP  It can happen, but has serious consequences, possibly leading to
Guild V Guild

GvG This will start off small but will also escalate if not contained
to Kingdom V Kingdom

KvK  Weeheee, all out war without the limits placed on you like DAOC.

I like the sound of the game, especially the fact that you can
powerlevel your character to very high level in 3 weeks, or play it to
the same level in 3 months. This is because t he game is not about
just building a char, but building a town/world. (anyone else bored of
XPing with DAOC)
