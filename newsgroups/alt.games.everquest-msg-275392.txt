Behind what curve? 

Most players don't want bought/sold accounts. (Even among those that 
support item sales, there are many that don't support character/account 
sales.)

There is a reason 'ebayer' is considered an insult, after all.

Why should soe/blizzard implement a feature that primarily irritates 
everyone around the player who bought the character/account?

The biggest group of people generally vocally in favour of selling 
accounts are those that are finished with the game, don't plan to 
return, and want to make a few bucks. (As if they think time spent 
playing the game was a financial investment.)  

Those that are actively playing have no need for the feature, and those 
that are just starting aren't doing themselves or anyone else a favour 
by starting at 68th level with 424AA. 

Thus its mainly a feature that benefits the people quitting the 
game...why should we develop features for them?
