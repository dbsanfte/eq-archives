Heh.  My wife plays a mage, and there's several spells she
didn't buy because she simply can't use them.  A mage,
for instance, can't use the arrows they summon (to the
best of my knowledge, anyway.)

It does make her day to be able to summon them, though,
enough that she actually went out and bought the spell just
to be able to do it.  One of those "Wow, I get to play with this
spell!!!" things.  Clerics get "Halo of Light", a head slot lightsource
that's summoned.   Totally useless, since any cleric should have
*armor* there by the time he gets the spell.    It's great to give
out, though.   And, since I hardly ever have to conjure my own food,
it lets me practice my conjuration skills, too.  I simply *love* the
newbies in Qeynos and Freeport when they ask for pp to buy a
lightsourse.  ;)
