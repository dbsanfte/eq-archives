The tree animation doesn't have a noticable effect on framerate.  The
problem with the trees is that they have more polygons than the
old-world trees, and there are a lot more trees in the Kunark forrests
than in the old-world forrests.  That's what hurts your framerate.

Take a close look at old-world trees sometime.  The trunk is only 3 or 4
polygons, and the brances and leaves are just 2 polygons.
