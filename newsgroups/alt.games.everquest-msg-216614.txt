On the bright side rogues are by far the best balanced of any of the 3 melee
classes. They do their job very well. Good dps, usefull secondary abilities,
ability to tank in a pinch.

Warriors ok dps, no secondary abilities, and are quite good tanks when all
other party members reduce there main function by 50%.

Monks good dps, no tanking ability , no usefull secondary abilities.

Complaining that rogues might be a bit underpowered compared to the
rididculously overpowered classes (cleric , bard, shaman, ranger), while
maybe true is kinda funny when comparing to the other 2 members of the pure
melee triumvirate.
