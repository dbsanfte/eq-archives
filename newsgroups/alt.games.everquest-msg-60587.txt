I've been going link dead (LD) a lot lately, and now it's starting to hurt
me! I've lost hours of exp due to getting killed while EQ servers disconnect
me! It's not my ISP, because after I go Link Dead, I wait a minute and go
back into the game, without ever dialing back up. Sony reps won't do
anything! What's the deal???

I don't have this problem with other online games -- sure sometimes there's
lag, but no "link death!"
