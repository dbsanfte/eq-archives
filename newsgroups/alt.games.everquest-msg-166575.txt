Yes and No to these questions at different times.  Some zones are all but
abandoned with the add of newer "better" zones, while others have been
re-born.  The Planes of Power pushed many of the 60+ folks out of the higher
zones and tend to make it easier for us pre-55 folks to get groups there.

It's still a great game, and the new additions (the bazaar, nexus ports and
Plane of Knowledge, etc.) will be nice changes from the days of old.

Good Luck!
