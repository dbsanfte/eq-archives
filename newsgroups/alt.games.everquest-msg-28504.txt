Lol, finally I learn to read all the replies before making one of
my own.

You made most of the points I intended to.

Heck, I rarely even memmed CHeal till I got into my late
40s and was grouping with 50s tanks.  It sounds great,
but in reality the long cast time and high mana cost means
that unless your target has HP over 2500 or so its only
usable as a post combat heal.  Otherwise you find that
the increase in efficiency doesn't overcome the problems
of aggro, waiting till tank is hurt enough (but you hope
not too hurt...) and the very long cast time.

SHeal, on the other hand, makes the 34 to 50 cleric
the best healer hands down for those levels... and
Celestial blows all comparison away.  Relatively fast,
more mana efficient, very low aggro, castable
-before- enough damage has been taken to use the
whole heal up... well, while you can see that a cleric
is a better healer from 34 to 50, from 44 up its
silly even to think about comparing him with the
other classes.

The distinction being made when shamans are
discussed is that shaman have other talents
that make them valuable contributors to a group,
just as do clerics.  This doesn't make them
better healers, if you want to see what I mean,
compare a group with two shaman to one with
a shaman and a cleric.  The shaman is a better
debuffer... no surprise, thats his job; buff the
tanks, debuff the mobs, and contribute some
light melee and secondary level healing to the
fight.


Clerics get better AC and HP and resist buffs,
better heals, can stun and fear while the shaman
cannot.  Shaman can haste the tanks, slow the
mobs, SOW the party (when possible, the best
buff in the game) tend to melee better, have
reasonable pets (especially buffed up to the nines)
and have a built in mana generator.

If you have to chose between a shaman and
a cleric, for some reason, then you need to take
the mobs you are going up against and the party
composition into account.  If you have both
available, though, I'd take both unless you somehow
built a 5 man group with no healer in it at all.

Biggest down side to a cleric, frankly, is the lack
of mana generation... come to think of it every
non-hybrid mana user but the cleric has some
way of boosting its meditation rate.  Hmm, topic
for another thread, I think.
