Yup!  And I love it.  No more shuffling stuff around to
free up the tradeskill container first.

Nope.

No.  It completely ignores whatever's already in the container,
and just does the combine (unless of course it needs an
ingredient that you're keeping *in* the container).

combines in an 8-slot sewing kit?  A 2-slot sewing kit?
