The AE groups I've been in have been:

1 cleric.
2 enchanters.
3 wizards.

Enchanters use their "color" stun lines, NOT the AE mez.  Mez takes too long
to cast, uses too much mana, and will be broken by the first AE nuke.  Keep
3 of the stuns up, and just chain cast, keeping all the mobs stunned.  You
need 2 enchanters so that they can cover each other's resists.

The wizards nuke.  An epic-equipped wizard also pulls.

The cleric heals.

Do you have an inferiority complex?
Do you feel that people persecute you?  Are you an idiot?
Can you stand your ground without sounding helpless?
