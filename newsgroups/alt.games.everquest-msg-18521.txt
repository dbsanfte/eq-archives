Hey Gets....

I timed the boats a couple of months back.  Boat from Butcherblock to
Fironia Vie takes 18 minutes (forget whether that includes the shuttle times
or not... don't think so.)  Boat from Qeynos to Erudin and back to Qeynos
again takes 18 minutes round trip.  Boat from Butcherblock to Freeport is 17
minutes.
