I'm sorry for asking here, but I don't have many contacts in the
military.  Many of you are informed in ways that goes beyond EQ. 

Does anyone know what a "bounced email" from someone in the Navy would
signify?  My friend is on the Saipan over in the middle east, and while I
know their email is occasionally "down" (it's a ship during wartime, after
all), it's never bounced before.  That I'm getting a bounce message means
that the server is up enough to bother to send me the "recipient not
recognized".  If it were really down, it wouldn't reply at all, would it?  
Or if they simply couldn't access it, it would simply store the message.

What I'm getting at is, how likely is it that this means he's
dead?  Course, I don't know how efficient the military is in regards to
deleting the email accounts of folks who have died, but...ugh, I'm
babbling now.

Any insight would be appreciated.
