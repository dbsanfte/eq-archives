Unfortunately, no.  The East Freeport Soulbinder is situated
between two archways, both heavily guarded by the Freeport
Militia, plus there's a wandering guard that walks right by
him.  So anyone KoS to the Freeport Militia is going to be
right out of luck.

It would have been handier if they had put him out in the
newbie area, near the tunnels that KoS people use to
sneak around/through Freeport.  That way he would be
safely usable by anyone regardless of faction issues.
