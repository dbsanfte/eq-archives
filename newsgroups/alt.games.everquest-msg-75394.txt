I'd be apt to say yes, simply because it's NT/2000 based (more stable) and
you can use the NSFT file system (less prone to corruption). I've been
running EQ (Luclin) on it flawlessly. It also comes with the System Restore
feature similar to the one included with Win ME.

There are some serious headaches to upgrading, though. I recommend you have
updated Win XP drivers ready to install for all your hardware before you
start. And backing up your important data is always a good idea before
attempting any sort of operating change.

Good luck!
