You're welcome to believe in psychics, Buddhism, psychic surgery,
Judaism, telekinesis, Christianity, chiropractors, divining,
communication with the dead, pet psychics, Islam, magic, auras,
Amway, crystals, telepathy, make money fast, magnets that help
you heal, fortelling the future, alien abductions, that the moon
landings were faked, Nostradamus, and Zeus all you want.  I won't
stop you.

Knock yourself out.  I'll stick with being one of those terrible
close minded skeptics.  Thanks.  :)
