You don't get it. I don't *care* what you believe.

Do you use usenet as a support group?

I certainly don't. At least, not *this* group.

If you or anyone else keeps coming back over and over because of it?
Yes.

You just accused me of exactly the same thing. If its not obsession
for you, then why would you say it is for me?

Please. Cry me a river. If they couldn't handle it they wouldn't be
here.

When you people are the judge and jury? Not even remotely.

You assign yourself and the others more importance than they deserve.

And I apply that to myself, as well. They shouldn't care what I think
of them, either. That's why I shrug off any whines about whether or
not I am being abusive. They have a killfile, *use* it.

Ironic. I am accused of reading people's minds and now you do exactly
the same thing.

Welcome to the dark side. :-)

To address this, once again, I don't respond any differently than they
do.

That would be a flame thread. You were saying something funny earlier,
something about being the better person....

I'll keep that in mind. /s

That's not my problem.

Like I said before, the response follows the tone of what I am
responding to. Even when they ease off.
