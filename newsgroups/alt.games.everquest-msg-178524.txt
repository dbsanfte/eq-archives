It used to be that you could edit your eqclient.ini file to activate the old
interface. I don't think that's possible any more. The January 9th patch
said:

"Demise of the Classic/Velious Interface
Over the last six months we have been keeping the Classic EverQuest
interface as well as the Velious interface working through all of the
features that we have added (built-in MP3 player, item links, compass,
enhanced /bug reporting tool, and others). However, with the release of some
of the new features in this patch, such as running EQ in a window, we must
now say goodbye to the older interfaces. They have been disabled as of
today.

They served us well."
