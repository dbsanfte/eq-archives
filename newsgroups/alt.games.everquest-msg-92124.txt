GEEZ $1.35 a day gonna kill ya ?
I spend three times that much on coffee a day.

$9.95 a month comes to about $0.34 a day.
WHERE can you get something that you can spend 12 to 14 hours
immersive hours a day for that kind of money ?

I'm hoping that the upped price will cut out some of the "KIDDIES"
that run thru zones shouting how they are "UBAH" and "MINES BIGGER
THAN YOURS".

From what I've seen so far it is more fun and there are less of the
above mentioned type running around.

Nothing like zoning in and seeing a GM in the zone.
