Well, I'm not familiar with Australian law. Frankly, that's a rather
asanine one, though. Basicly, if BNet ever shuts down completely,
they're gonna get their asses burned for violating that ACCC thingy
unless they recall all the packages on the shelves and change them?
Even if it gets to the point where so few people use it, it's not
worth the cost of keeping it up?

Sounds about as stupid as Mattel having to put notices on the Barbie
commercials that she does not walk and talk by herself...
