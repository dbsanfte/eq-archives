As a Wiz, I always have some kind of levitate on. But if you don't,
yes you need to be a little careful comming down that pyramid.

I only noticed this reduction in number of skels about a week and a
half ago, but have since confirmed with some other players on my
server that used to hunt there. Maybe I haven't waited long enough (if
the spawn times got greatly increased). But I'm pretty sure that they
are now on a 20 min spawn. I'll check again tonight to make sure I'm
not full of it.
