It is easy to get your account back if you are legit. Tell Verant CS
that you lost your password. They will require you to provide specific
info to prove the account was originally yours, then they will issue
you a new password and you are all set.

If you have lost any items or characters due to the "hack", then that
is just too bad. I have yet to see a "hack" that was NOT done by a
friend, relative, or guildmate. All have been the result of  that
player gaving their account info out. If you play with fire your will
eventually get burned.
