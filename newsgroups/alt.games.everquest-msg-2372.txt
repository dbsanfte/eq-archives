There's been some good advice offered on where to go and how to get
there, and I appreciate it. I was also interested in some creation
specifics too. For instance, some guides say to put the max into
strenght and the remaining five into dex. Some say 10 STR, 10 AGI and 5
DEX. Any thoughts? Also, how do you spread around your early training
points. And are there any good quests in the troll home city area that
are actually worth doing? Or should I just get out there and bash till
4th lvl then bash my way towards the froglocks?
   Also, I always seem to have a good time hunting in the Karanas and
HH, so being able to either get into Qeynos or HHK would be a plus later
on. Either of them easier, factionwise, to get up to the point where I
can deal with merchants and bankers, as well as getting past the guards?
