I point you to Larry1964's thread below.  In the case of popular media
there would be a <lot> more Larrys out there (hundreds of thousands in
the case of a national network, I am quite certain).  And an awful lot
of these Larrys would succeed in getting attention from media outlets
and politicians (the overwhelming majority of whom would no doubt be
doing their best to be the most noticeable Larry of them all).

I know quite a few people who watched the "media circus", though I
avoided it in keeping with my habit of avoiding TV in general.  I've
found most people to be highly irrational about death (big shock, I
know) and I think all the rest pretty much follows.
