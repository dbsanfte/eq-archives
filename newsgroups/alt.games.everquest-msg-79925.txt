The upper person can't be any more than 1.5x the lowest person, or else the
lowest won't get xp.  The rules may be different for <15.

Clerics cast a no-xp rez at 29, their first xp rez at 39 (50%?  Don't
recall), at least 90% at 49, and probably around 95% at 56.

Necros get something like a 98% rez in their upper 40s or low 50s (I forget)
but the cost is a gem that you only get if someone of high level sacrifices
their own non-rezzable experience.

Sorry, I don't have exact numbers.  I've never given a crap about powergamer
numbers so I don't remember them.
