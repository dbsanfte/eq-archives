I haven't played on Halloween since the first one in '99.

I mean, com'on....fucking level 50 skeletons in RIVERVALE!?!
That were non-KOS to the guards?  Apparantly RV was the
new "I LUV SKELES" zone for the day, so I didn't play in 2000,
2001, or last night.  Sure, I participated in the Halloween events
last year, helping out a bunch of folks find their class-specific
stuff...but actually play ON 10/31?

Not a chance...
