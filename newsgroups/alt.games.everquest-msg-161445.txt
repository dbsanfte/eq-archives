I see no real reason to consider it "broke."  The article says that it is,
but doesn't really back that up.  It gives plenty of different options, but
no compelling reason (at least that I could see) to go away from the "one
man, one vote" method.

One would think, but 2000 seemed to suggest otherwise.

Sounds like a good way to cull "points" for the unscrupulous....  A little
rounding here, a small change in the interpretation of the conditions
there...  I'd rather have it "this is the person I'm backing to be
President, and that's that."  Though, it would be funny to see them try to
explain how the 600 votes that "suddenly" turned up in the church are all
worded exactly the same...

Not really.  Sometimes it's best to be clear and concise.  I prefer a system
with a well-functioning spinal column.
