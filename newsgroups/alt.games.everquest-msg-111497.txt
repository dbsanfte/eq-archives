I don't know if it was chessboard island or not, but the same thing
happened to me going from FP to BB. Zoned (supposedly into OOT) and
POOF - I'm standing on the docks on some little island. While waiting
for the boat to come by and pick me up, I decided to do a bit of
exploring; big mistake. Some NPC near the top of the hill knocked the
crap out of me as I turned to run and saw the boat - sailing away.
Luckily, when I hopped back onto the boat to go looking for my corpse,
the zone into OOT kicked me to the little island AGAIN.

Also caught myself being hauled up the crows nest pole once in time to
sit/stand/jump/turn/run out of "its" grasp.

The boats are DEFINITELY a pain.
