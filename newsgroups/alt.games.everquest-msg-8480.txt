You're at a prime "age" to do the Armor of Ro quests.  Ro armor is
excellent at your level, and is even good enough that my level
51 Paladin is still wearing about half of his original Ro
armor.

Not only is it good armor (and looks great), but even though
the Ro quests are hard and lengthy to do (or perhaps because of
that fact) doing my Ro armor quests has been some of the best
fun I've ever had in Everquest.  And since the pieces of the
quest are very far-flung, it's a great incentive to "see the
world", traveling to place you probably would never have gone
to otherwise.

No mid-level Paladin should be without Ro armor, and all Paladins
should quest their own armor, instead of getting hand-me-down Ro
or buying it at auction.  Trust me on this: earn it yourself,
and you'll feel like a real Knight.
