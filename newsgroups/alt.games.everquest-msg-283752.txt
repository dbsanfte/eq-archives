I depended on /loc.  I figured out that one coord was (essentially)
latitude and the other longitude, so I'd /loc, run a short distance,
/loc, and then translate the change in location to a  direction (e.g.
if first coord decreased I was headed south, if 2nd coord increased I
was headed west, or someting like that).  

I have to say I prefer having a reliable compass and markers for
groupmates on the minimap (as in WoW).  Maybe it's "cheating" but as
far as I'm concerned it's just taking some of the useless drudgery out
of a game.
