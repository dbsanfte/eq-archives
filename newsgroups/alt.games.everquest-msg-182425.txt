Um... doesn't a chanter have to have AAs to turn other people into 
stuff?  Or was your puller a bard?  Although I thought even they had to 
be fairly high level to use the Lute of the Howler.

Speaking of bards, there was one on TMarr that led to a few of my 
earlier demises.  He was in his 50s, and he took me a lot of places and 
helped me a lot, but twice ... well :)  One time he took me to one of 
the Karanas.  I can't remember which one, but he dragged me into the 
middle of one of them and sat me down and said that if we waited for 
night, there'd be this cool fight between two NPCs to watch.  There 
wasn't, but I did end up getting eaten by a werewolf.  He'd forgotten 
about them. :)  The second time was getting to LOIO.  Oh how I hated 
that run.  Introduced me to how much I hate the place now.  The silly 
bard ran up the river instead of along the wall, and one spider aggro'd, 
then another, and another, and another - until both of us died.  To be 
fair, he did say "RUN", but it took about 3 seconds for another spider 
to find me and root me and eat me, seeing as I didn't know the way and 
had to stick to the water :)
