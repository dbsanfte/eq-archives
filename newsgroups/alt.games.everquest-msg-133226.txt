}Would be interesting how you came to THIS conclusion..

Should be obvious, mate.  He came to that conclusion by the exaion that he 
is not 'clear and precse'.  Simiarly, by the exact same mechanism you used 
to conclude that Lesa is using a PC wayto say, "wait until you're older".  
It is, as he said, misrepresentation, and more specifically, the 
generation of strawmen arguments.  You may want to think about it, because 
it actually makes you much less enjoyable to argue with.  In an enjoyable 
argument, you would have a point, and evidence to support it, rather than 
trying to spend your whole time disproving things no one claimed.
