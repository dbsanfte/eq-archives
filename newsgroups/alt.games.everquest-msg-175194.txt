Been there done that. Ive been in groups who have passed up a cleric LFG,
only to have our own cleric inform us "Its time for me to leave now" just
minutes afterward and leave us stranded. All I suggest you do is keep a list
of names of people who have messed you about, and try not to group with them
in future. Its a pity we dont get a /badmark command like we get /friend and
/ignore. Maybe have marked players come up in a different color (tells and
says) so you dont miss them.

ps POI sucks for xp. Try and get a group in LC/RC in POD or the hobgoblins
(or  consorts if youre brave) in PON.
