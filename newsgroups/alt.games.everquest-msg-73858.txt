My experience with groups, since I am not "guilded" is that sometimes the
karma works, sometimes it doesn't.  Being an older gamer (cough, cough, 43),
I really get frustrated with the gimme this (SoW), gimme that (heal me
now--when down less than 1/2 bub), attitude of some players.  And the
greediness of many players is frustrating.  There used to be a tendency to
master loot, then split the loot between all when someone had to leave.
That way everyone got a fair share.  Now it's just the tanks looting
everything, split off for the monks, etc., so when I group, I generally get
nothing but exp (which, btw, I can get much more of solo).  But I do LOVE
the interaction when I get a good group, all know how to play, don't run at
the first sign of a challenging battle, and share the loot properly.  A lot
of group leaders, when they declare FFA (free for all looting) seem to
forget the healers and casters who must med every chance they get, which
doesn't allow time for finding the slain mob and trying to beat the tank
(who is standing right over it) to the loot.  So, needless to say, I usually
only group with some folks I have known since day one of EQ, or folks they
recommend.  Or, if I am playing solo, say in East Wastes, I can kind of
watch how a group is operating and if they advertise for my class, and I
think they have it together, I'll join them just to have someone to talk to.
I've tried and tried to get those mobs to talk about life, but they just
seem to keep swinging =).  My advice to you is keep trying groups, you will
eventually find folks who play your style, are great to talk to, and you
will have friends for your EQ life.  p.s.  Nothing wrong with solo or
teaming, just takes a bit longer to get the nice things).  Hope this was
helpful....
