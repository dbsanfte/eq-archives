This is either:
a)a myth
b)Bugged
c)I grouped with a moron in the Stye

A group of undead got TTZ by someone, then, having seen their quarry
vanish through a sewer duct, walked back home, passing by me and my
party...and proceeded to whup thecrap out of us. I can only assume
they aggroed on us as they walked by for some reason, and I really
hope no one in my party decided to attack them for the hell of it.
