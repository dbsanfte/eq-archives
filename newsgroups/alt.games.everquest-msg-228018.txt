Doesn't it suck looking for the worst in your fellows all the time?
Maybe, like me, he paid to equip his twink with winnings from things
that no one needed and thus went to open roll. It really doesn't take a
L65 long to win at least a couple of 10-50k items while working on aa
points. Sometimes just being in places ahead of the crowd gets you a
couple of nice items that sell for huge platinum before the crowd gets
there and the price falls. That 2hb 31/30 staff from BoT sold for 20+k
on my server for the first month it dropped, recently a friend picked
one up for 200pp. One staff of flowing water won when there's no monk in
the group can equip a twink pretty damn well too.

It's quite easy to end up with more than enough plat to twink out a
character if you play a lot with a high level character without
accepting things under false pretenses. Hell I think I made about 10k
plat just from the chitinous drops helping guildmates farm the fungus
grove shard piece for vt.
