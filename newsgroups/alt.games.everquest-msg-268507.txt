All downsides if the reason you play games is to just do the same
thing over and over again.

Even from your point of view, now that EQ2 is out, you have to look at
and revalue the return on time investment with any character.
Time/effort spent levelling an EQ1 character will become invalidated
far sooner than the same investment into a new EQ2 character.

But don't let that stop you from playing EQ1 if you really enjoy it. I
still play old NES games, even though there's zero persistant value
for my efforts.
