No I'm not fighting undead, clerics have very little real advantage in 
doing so as the damage output is almost entirely off the proc on the 
hammer, not the damage/delay, not even with undead bane added in.

A nuke?  Don't be silly, thats a waste of mana.  DOT?  They are less 
efficient than the nukes!

Realistically, I'd use a root for the 9th spell, so that I could back 
up, mem a heal, cast it, remem the root, and go back to work.

But its easier to pick targets that aren't that hard, after all, clerics 
aren't shaman.

Not if it had a graphic!  Which was me cooperating with your joke. 
Maybe we should adopt smilies, but I've a whole lifetime of dry "wit" 
behind me and just don't care to cute it up.

Sure but thats...  I just don't think we are getting each other here.

I can loot soulbound on equip items and sell them in the bazaar for uber 
phat cash.  Once someone has one and gears up with it he's stuck with 
it, but that doesn't stop me farming it because I never intended to wear it.

I see the point, sort of, what I don't see is the attraction, the reason 
you'd copy the idea from WOW, if thats what has happened.

Just as in current EQ, at least for droppables.

I guess one advantage is that you can make the guy that claimed an item 
based on Need Before Greed actually put the item on, so now he can't 
sell it out from under you.

Unless the item isn't Lore, in which case he puts on the one he already 
owns, and leaves the duplicate still sellable.
