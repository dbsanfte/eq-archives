Taras, in the way only Taras can do, said something to 'Dark' about his
favorite 'bizbeeisms' being where he urges someone to commit suicide.

I guess after maneuvering through this guy's posts for years in the UO
newsgroup then here, you get full - stuffed even.

Obsessed?  Nah, there are others that come by here often enough that seem to
have that area well covered.

I do indeed know better - and that's to just killfile his posts, which I've
done *again*.  I have to tell you folks, everytime I get rid of the filters
and get back to the *whole* of the postings to this group, here pops up
bizbee again with the same thing.
