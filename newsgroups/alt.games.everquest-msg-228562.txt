Which, yet again as I say every time someone brings up this fucking
moronic attempt at loop holing, DOES NOT FUCKING WORK. The INSTANT
"merchandize" is changed hands, it ceases being "selling my time". The
merchandize is a REQUIRED part of the deal, so you're selling the
merchandize, not the time. Same applies to specific services.

Besides, no plat-selling service has ever advertised "selling the time
we spent to earn plat". They always have advertised their service as
selling the *PLAT* The plat selling services usually don't even spend
the time to earn the plat themselves. They buy it from players then
resell it. Again, never offering to buy the "time" from those people.

The time was already spent before the deal was ever offered. Thus, the
time isn't being sold. Technically, the time spent on SOE's servers
isn't really "theirs" to sell, anyway. Permission to perform a service
for a fee on someone else's property is the owner's right to grant or
deny, anyway. In this case, it has been expressly denied. They have
the right to tell you you can't conduct BUSINESS on their property,
and they have civil law to back it up.

Doesn't necessarily mean it's not a scam. Any time an item is sold
without the seller having the proper authority to sell said item, it's
considered a scam. Doesn't matter if the buyer knows it or not.
