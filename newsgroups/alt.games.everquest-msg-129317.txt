Not sure if you are implying VI should rez you or something for going LD,
but that would be impossible to determine if it was legit or not. For
example, big_ass_mob01 is whipping yer ass, and instead of die, you pull the
Ethernet cable or hit reset or something, and voila, instant LD.

It seems GM reponse has alot to do with when you play, I play late at night
(10pm-2am PST), so if I petition it takes *atleast* 30mins to get someone.
Persoanlly I've only needed to petitoion a few times for some bizzare
situations (corpse in a wall and what not), and leave the GM's alone unless
I have a real issue.

I think my $12.95 is more than enough, matter of fact, if they raise the
price too much more, I'd leave.
