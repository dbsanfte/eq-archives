I agree that the way she (he?) prefaced her post indicated that she
(he?) obtained the product in an illicit way, however, that being said
the product it's self is not illicit. It is an official release from
SoE that is actually in retail stores.

Neko, really needs to keep an eye on what she (he?) is implying, but
other people need to be a little more informed before they blow their
top. But then this is Usenet, flaming is practically expected.
