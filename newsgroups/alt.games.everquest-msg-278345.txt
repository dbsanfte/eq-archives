Greetings.

Since the latest patch, I have been having momentary screen freezes during 
gameplay. Casting spells, opening bags, hitting the I key for inventory, in 
fact almost anything except targetting things with a mouseclick, all result 
in about a 1 second freeze or lock up. Extremely frustrating to say the 
least.

I have tried a thorough patch, resetting my computer, checking for latest 
drivers all to no avail.
Apparently there is a few others who share this problem on The Rathe, but as 
of yet, I have had no response from Sony via Email, petition or bug report, 
so I'm asking if anyone here has had similar problems and was able to fix 
this.

Any help?
Thanks in advance.
