suffered the same prob, was caused my several things. Make sure your system
get's cooled enough! Overheating can be a cause of problems. In my case due
to flatcables of 1 scsi controller and 1 additional ide-controller,
attaching the flatcables to the frame with additional tiewraps made sure
that the airflow was not interupted at keyponts.

And set your bios to failsafe don't tweak it, some things may work for while
but cause quits to desktop sooner or later, especially agp and pci related
items.

And a clean install of windows and getting the latest drivers might also
bring some relief.
