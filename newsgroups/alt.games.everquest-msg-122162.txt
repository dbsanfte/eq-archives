You never know.  Some of these people are EXTREMELY superstitious.  When I
first got a broadband connection I had no firewall.  While I was at work my
system got hacked by someone who had compromised some born-again site my
wife frequents.  She was writing an email to the minister that runs the site
and I guess that's when everything went hay-wire.  I don't know as I wasn't
home at the time.  She calls her minister to say she thinks the computer is
"possessed by the devil".  God, I wish I had been home.  He instructed her
to not touch it (I would have said SHUT IT OFF NOW!) but it was still on
when I got home with some suckass doing whatever he wanted with my computer
for several hours at this point.  Luckily I have nothing to hide.

The moral of this story?  My wife is a pinhead.
