Oh mighty all-knowing usenet:

Any suggestions on items for a level 30 druid ? Currently I have gear
picked up around the world in my early 20'es, and I can see that I have to
to somthing to keep up to the level.
I am looking for the druid equivalent to the warriors "crafted armor quest"
or similar drops/quests. I am not a big solo'er, so I will go for WIS over
AC gear.

I have done the Testament, and I think it is the only of my items worth
keeping. As a "porting is free" druid, I have no pp but for my spells, so
shopping bigtime is not an option.

Looking forward for suggestions from all you wise druids...
