Interesting, I'd have thought monks or rangers would be better haste
targets, since haste won't speed up the principle damage component
of a rogue, the backstab.  Monks and rangers both have the highest
damage output of all melee classes (other than backstab) and should
benefit the most... although increasing a ranger's aggro might not be
worth the increase in damage.

The problem with this system is that it means casting the spell on
everyone in the party at once.  At high levels, casting SOW costs
next to no mana, so its natural to do it this way, but at his level its
better to stagger the cast so he never has to do more than one
target at a time.  I do the same thing with my higher mana cleric buffs,
Shield of Words, for example, is quite a mana hog, and I'm not
going to cast it on myself as a timer if I don't need it, nor am I
going to cast it on three tanks in my group all at once if I can
avoid doing so... thats 4 SoW in a row and I'm at 20M now, guess
we sit and wait.  Instead, casting SoW on demand means I'm
never taking more than a 20% hit, rarely adds much wait time at
all.  Yes, I don't look like a god, but I know in my heart I'm
being more efficient.
