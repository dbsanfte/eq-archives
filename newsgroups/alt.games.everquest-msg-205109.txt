Just a detail to add to what others have replied...  Druid swarm-
type DoTs (Stinging Swarm, Creeping Crud, Drones of Doom, & etc.)
have a -100 resist adjustment.  This means that they very rarely
fail to stick to a mob (I have had a swarm-type DoT resisted by a
blue con mob exactly once each with my two Druids, one is L41 and
the other L37).
