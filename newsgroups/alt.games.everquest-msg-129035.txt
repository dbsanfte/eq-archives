Ok I keep recommending this but really it's the best, cheap weapon a rogue
can get.  A Sturdy Grimling Mining Pick.  You should be able to pick up one
of these for under 200pp.  I think the stats are 29DEL and 12 DMG.  The only
drawback, is that the weapon is not magic, so hang on to your Tombcarver for
those situations that need magic weapons.
