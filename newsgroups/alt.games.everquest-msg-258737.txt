Lately I ahve been having  a lot of fun with my enchanter. Guild has been
very supportive with my decision to make her my "main", over my Druid or
Warrior.  Lately thought Ive been a bit frustrated with trying to aquire the
spell Forlorn Deeds. Thanks to a guildy thats a research-aholic, and some
fortuituous purchases of pages in the baz I've been able to get all of what
I consider the "essential" level 60 spells, Dictate, Speed of the Brood, and
a 3rd spell that I cant seem to recall the name of right now, the single
target haste spell. KEI was obtained on a guild raid of RC / DS, so thats
taken care of :)

Still though, Folorn deeds has eluded me, and thats been an irritant to me.
70% slow would be really nice for those times when a Shaman isnt available.
I know that Shiftless Deeds is only 5% Less at my level, but I am looking at
starting to get groups befoer to long in BoT, and HoH  where that extra 5%
could actually make a difference.

So with that said can anyone give me the benefit of thier wisdom in how THEY
obtained Forlorn Deeds ? Ive been watching the baz for the pages, but pg 91
( left ) appears to be a semi-rare drop from VT, a zone Im not keyed for.
( Working on that though ! )

Any input is appreciated!!!
