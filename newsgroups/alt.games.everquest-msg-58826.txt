Typically the group leader will chime up about responsabilities.

I had the misfortune to group with a rather pathetic chanter in Velks Lab.
War comes back with 2 spiders on him and we begin the fight.  Once the 1st
spider was half dead I chimed up, "chanter, care to mez 1?"  We had to beg
for haste/boon/clarity.  Definately on my no-group list.  I was just praying
to see "Enchanter LFG" so I could replace him.
