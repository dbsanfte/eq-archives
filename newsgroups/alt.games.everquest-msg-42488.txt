Starting around the 30s, reputation starts to matter.  Some just don't
notice until the 50s because 1) they solo when nobody invites them into
a group, or 2) they power up to 50 faster than average so they outrun
their reputation.

Very true, of all classes that do not have an obvious single purpose in a
group.

Speaking as an enchanter, root is just about always appreciated.
It makes it easy to back up and mez.  It's almost no mana and it doesn't
overwrite snare (it used to, and caused many trains when it broke, which
is probably why it's not used enough now), so there's very little reason
not to be root-happy.

I like the "cast evac early, duck out if it's not needed" tactic.  Just
be clear up front who is allowed to call for evac.

Communication like this is the single biggest indicator of a good group.

Yup.  This kind of error kills enchanters (followed by the rest of the
party in many cases).  Calling out dots is a good idea too, so the party
knows that target cannot be switched away from.
