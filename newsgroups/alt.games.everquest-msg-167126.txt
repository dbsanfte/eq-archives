This are settings for the particle systems as you could guess from
their names. These settings you can adjust in the display options
ingame.

This are some settings for the soundsystem. No idea, what exactly they
do. Except the Sound44k which could possibly be some switch for the
sampling rate of the sound and so control the quality of the sound.
Something about this mixahead was mentioned in a prior patch message if
i'm remembering right.
> DefaultChannel=8
This is the default channel you're talking to in the game. I don't know,
which number corresponds to which channel, but you can easily set this
in the game through the main windows channel menu.
I hop this helps you a bit
