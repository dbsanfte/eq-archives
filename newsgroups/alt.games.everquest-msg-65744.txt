It means as you suspected. IBM jerked you around.

Out of my league. I know *how* to do it, it's just another option
buried in the BIOS. I just don't know what any of it means.

Yes, and that's probably your best bet.

It will allow you to get visuals on your machine because of the way
Video cards work. This explanation probably won't be technically
correct, but should suffice conceptually...

You may have noticed when booting computers, often one of the first
things you see is a message from the video card (stating mfr. bios
version, etc.).

Video cards have the ability to insert themselves into the computer
BIOS at a very early point in the bootup sequence. All video cards
have a certain standard minimum level of functionality which requires
no drivers. This basic format will allow for text mode, as well as
limited graphics (basic VGA 640x480, I believe). This, then, is enough
for Windows to show you what you need to install the new drivers.


Using the PCI version of the card you won't get as good performance as
you would with a real AGP, but it'll probably be plenty good. Just
make sure you get a really good PCI card.
