It's not just the low end population that's dwindling. At least among
my aquaintences, the highest end raiders are taking a pretty serious
hit also.

 ...and that might well be a bigger problem, long term.

You might be surprised. Even a newbie, if he doesn't mind farming
trade skill components for a few hundred plat, should find it trivial
to solo as a low level melee. Unless you just can't stand the boredom
of soloing, there isn't any use for a low level melee to group. 

Even at the higher levels, it just isn't all that hard to solo a
melee. Last week, I pulled a 46 warrior out of semi-retirement and
solo'd hit up to almost 50th lvl to catch up with some friends. It
took me about 4 hours per level through 49, although it will probably
take closer to  6 hours to get that last level before 50.
