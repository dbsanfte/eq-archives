Used to be 175 for banded.  Next step after that is Plate armor, it is
cheaper than the Ornate Ring.  It is a royal pain in the butt, as you need
to farm for pelts (LQ,MQ,HQ) and spiderling silks to make the leather
padding.  That will take you to 214 I think now, not certain, I'd have to
look it up.  Used to take you to 242.
