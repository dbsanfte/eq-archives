Hi there.

People keep advising me not to buy a horse cause it blocks out the screen
and you can't see / target but I can't see my High Elf Cleric riding a
lizzy.  He'd be much more noble on a horse.  Could someone please post a
link to a screenshot of what a horse view looks like so I can see exactly
how much screen is blocked by the horse head?

Thanks,

T.
