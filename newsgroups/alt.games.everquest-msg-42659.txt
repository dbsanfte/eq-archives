Yes, they do. At least, some of them do. I was watching bin Laden addressing
a crowd, and this is exactly what he was saying to them, if the translation
is to be believed. In evidence he pointed to the bombing that claimed the
lives of 241 US Marines in 1983. He told the crowd, that as soon as the US
military faces casualties, it goes home.
