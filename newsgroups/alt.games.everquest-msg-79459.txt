  They were genuine corpses, but some characters will be accepted in
at least some places in the Foreign Quarter.  My erudite shadow knight
was accepted in the 3rd Gate without any problem, as long as I didn't
wander too close to the necromancer/shadow knight guild.

  There are a number of was to retreive your possessions if you're
dead in an area where you're KOS.  Maybe you're not familiar with the
/corpse command, but when you use it, you summon your corpse to your
feet (it only works if you're within a certain range of your corpse).
Using this command you can "drag" your corpse to a safe spot.  You can
do this while invisible too.

  Or, you can /consent someone who isn't KOS (kill on sight) and they
can drag your corpse for you.

  Also, there's the necromancer "Summon Corpse" spell, but that is
mainly used in the most desperate of situations, since it requires
both a high level necromancer to cast (and the spell, last I checked,
is a drop off a mob in a dungeon rather than one that can simply be
purchased) and also consumes a costly regeant... a "coffin" that costs
something like 120-200 platinum that can only be purchased in Neriak.
They aren't portable either... they're a "container" so they take up a
main inventory space, weigh a lot and don't hold much.  Also, they can
only be purchased in a couple of places (Neriak is one of them).

> I take it that Drow are persona non grata in some areas, too?

  Dark elves (I don't like calling them "drow", despite the
similarities... they're not drow) are KOS in many cities (mostly those
of a "good" or "neutral" character.)  It's a little more difficult to
travel and find a place to do business, typically, if your character
is evil (though it's give and take... in some regions "good"
characters are at a disadvantage.)
