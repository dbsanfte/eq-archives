Ahh, JaZZ, I know. I just can't figure out why they'd post to an alternate
language NG :( (which likely says something about my sense heading :)) I'd
*love* to be able to read it (though I've been informed a few times that
most of it is spam -- and I'll take that one for what it's worth because *I*
damn sure couldn't tell it from spam or hello, kiss my butt! :)) Yes, we
actually are spolied, aren't we? That sucks. Well. it certainly sucks a
little, anyway. I know that *I'm* used to everything being in English for
our ease or whatever reason. But I still can't get the alternate language
posting to what someone can obviously *see* is an english NG... unless I'm
just not recieving the Chinese/Swahili one? :) Now if someone could
answer -that- I'd give 'em a kiss ;) Or at least a really big thank you! ;)
