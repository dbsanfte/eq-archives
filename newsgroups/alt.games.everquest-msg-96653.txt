Rangers (and I presume Druids) have all sorts of fun with the 
fact that the icons for Snare and SoW are identical...

As long as they're busy making changes to the game this
month, how about some new spell icons that are more 
distinguishable from each other?

Heck, at least while casting I can press "Alt" and get
label-popups on my spellcasting gems.  There's *no* way
to do a quick look at your current buffs to see what
you've got up and what you don't...  Wouldn't it be great
if all the buff icons were recognizably unique in some way?
