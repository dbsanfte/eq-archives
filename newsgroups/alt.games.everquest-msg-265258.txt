I didn't play in the WoW stress test, so don't know how they handle that.
DAoC handles it by having zoning in that situation.  The original game had
zones as follows:
    Each of the three realm's outdoor areas
    Each of the three realm's capital cities
    Each dungeon

The first expansion added another outdoor zone to each realm, and more
dungeons.  The second expansion added another small outdoor zone to each
realm, and a large outdoor zone.

The housing expansion added a housing zone to each realm.

The RvR revamp shrunk the original three outdoor zones, removing the
frontier areas from them, and added a new single frontier that has about the
same land mass as the parts removed from the three other zones plus an
ocean.  There are also battlegrounds (basically, level-restricted PvP areas)
that are separate zones.

(It always bugged me when zoning in and out of the capital cities in DAoC
that the clocks weren't synced.  It might be noon outside, and midnight in
the city!).

Well, DAoC deals with that by not having those spells. :-)  Almost all ports
are between zones.  There is a port between the border keeps on the co-op
server, so I went there and tried it.  It was an instantaneous port.

Well, now that I think about it...there IS something like a port: respawning
after death.  That too is fast, but they could be cheating on that one.
When you die, there is a slight delay before you can /release, I believe,
and perhaps they load your bind zone then.

Anyone here know how SWG handles zones?
