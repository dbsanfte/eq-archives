Congratulations!
The ToV camp is quite annoying, but worth it.

When I did the camp, no one bothered me, but I got tired of waiting and
left, but then accidentally gated back on top of Dyllin Starsine (yes, thats
what his name really is) with a 58 or so rogue in position to BS him, lol,
rogue stepped aside, I nuked him silly, no smuggler interference and blam, I
got a book, rogue congatulates me, and after about 2.5 hours of camping
total (not counting times I just stepped into the zone and checked track for
Dyllin).  But the way it seems, I got lucky not having to fend off KSers, I
had kept see invis up the WHOLE camp, as well as Skin like rock, SoW and
Barbcoat.
