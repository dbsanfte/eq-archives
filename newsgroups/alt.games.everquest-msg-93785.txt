"Judging by its social structure and nothing else, EQ is most certainly
not the game for you."

Why is it that newsgroup denizens love nothing better than to stand on a
soapbox and pontificate at those who don't give a damn about their little
pretend community?  Hmm.  I think I'll do a comparison test!  I'll find some
store dumb enough to take back opened software, burn the EQ disc and copy the
CD key, return the whole thing, then log in and spam obscenities while clocking
how long it takes me to get banned in comparison to Asheron's Call!  Then
again, why bother?

EQ is commonly viewed as a chat room with monsters, played by pack of catass
scented shut-ins who let their spouses leave them and their babies starve as
they run their static characters on a tedious hamster-wheel of leveling in
mindless pursuit of joining an uber-guild so that they can harvest whatever
shiny widget of k3w1ness Verant has decided their class can have, and are
either tormented or outright banned by a customer service staff that openly
hates them.
