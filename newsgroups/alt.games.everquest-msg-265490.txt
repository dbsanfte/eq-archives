If you can find a single example of any other religious group offering space
to be used and being turned down, while a "christian" church is used
instead, then you may have a valid point.

Accepting a donation isn't endorsement.  Accepting a donation from one while
turning down an equal donation from another could at least be argued as
such.

Considering the goofy stuff that people litigate over in this world, it's a
safe assumption that someone, somewhere, has already tried to find such an
example.  =)
