I have never played EQ or the like - the only dabbling with 'fake' rpgs like Diablo ( maxed out 3 classess)  or Neverwinter. Can someone please tell me if they think that this may be a 'good' change for me.
I do like starwars and want to try a new 'pace', I love fps's but dont want to be bored to death playing a game. I dont mind the concept of upgrading and proffessions - gut I want to have fun at it - not going outside of towns like Morrowing and casting 2000 spells to get to the next level.
I know this is different for everyone and is a tough question to ask - but anyone who may have a style like mine or know what I'm talking about please reply before I open my SWG box.

Thx in advance,
East
