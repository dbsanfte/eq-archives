You delude yourself. They will be buying it from a twink that belongs to a big
guild or one that has a high level protector. If the item has value, the true
"farmers" will find a way to get it. TCC results in the casual player not being
able to get want he/she wants because they are now unable to solo for the reward
when no one is around. TCC is the worse thing every thought up for the casual
player.

Except that the majority of them are playing EverQuest. If you believe that you
like it rough and not easy, never take a rez again. If you believe that you like
playing the game rough and not easy, pay 10k for the SSoY. If you believe you
like to play the game rough and tough, go to these empty zones now of your
appropriate level and get that group you want. I believe that you will find that
everyone single player wants to have some things safe and easy. Hence, un-used
zone at low level with contain items that are desired by high levels because it
is the best thing they can have. For a while at least.

But the information from zones even with the TCC is on the net in two days. See
Warrens and Stoneburnt for examples. Those that desire the be first to post
information and get the public recognition of the fact that they are first will
find a way to be first. No TCC code is going to stop this.

And can you explain this one for me? I personally have do not understand it. I
do not see an example of it. I never have seen an example of it. I mean, what
stopped these low level players from camping any location in Upper Guk in the
first place? Permfrost? Kerra Ridge? Swamp of No Hope? Droga? All of these are
under used zones for their level. What would the TCC do to change the fact that
these zones would be under used? How can the TCC increase the number of people
(other then farmers with 2 accounts) in Droga? Why are they not there now?

And may I ask again, how is the TCC going to increase the number of "Newbie(s).
Plural, not singular" that show up in zones that are under used? TCC does not
change that. Fact is, our 2 examples of current zones that we can use to make
our guess from in this discussions are Warrens and Stoneburnt. Warrens was a
dead zone after about 3 weeks regardless of the fact that TCC was in place. All
predictions is that the Stoneburnt zone will also be dead in about 2 or 3 more
weeks regardless of TCC. Why? Maybe because they are useless. So, if they are a
useless zone, why cannot a casual player that is above the level for these zones
go investigate and play around in the zone? BTW, part of exploring any zone is
seeing what drops off mobs. Even those that have visit the spoiler sites will
kill a mob to "see what it drops".
