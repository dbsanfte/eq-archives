Oh... I read the whole thread again and I did not put the right 
sense on your words. Excuse-me for this, please.
I thought you were telling that all French people are as this image 
of the 'French player', needing lots of baths and smoking 
cigarettes by whole packets behind his screen. But this picture is 
wrong too, you seem to know it.
My first answer would suit to another poster, my own post was not 
in a good position within the thread.
