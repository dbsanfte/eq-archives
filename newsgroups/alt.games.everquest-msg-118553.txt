It takes about an hour of easy faction work to get to Ally with about half of
Shadowhaven. Find the questgiver near the Paludal Caverns zone and bind next to
him. I think his name is something like Trade Commissioner Michael.

You'll wind up going to the Bazaar, then through Echo Caverns (invis for this)
to Fungus Grove. Gate back and repeat until you get to the con level you like.
