	Sorry, but I don't see a difference here.

	Don't let *them* choose.  The way to lose a war is to let the other guy
decide how it's going to be fought -- *you* make that decision.

|I disagree with the effectiveness of terror as a weapon, especially against

|economic.

	It has a minimal amount of economic effect, and no political value
whatsoever.  No nation will capitualate to terrorists.  Every world leader
knows that once you do that, you are finished.

	We've gone through a lot of public angst.  We lost some money.  A few
people died.

	On their side, a friendly regime got toppled, another one is on the
chopping block, and Israeli extremists have taken advantage of the situation
to push their hard-line agenda (since the US is in no position to pressure
them back towards moderation, not while we're out knocking over governments.)
The US is more involved in their part of the world than ever before and will
be for the next several decades.
