Some people have had success with EQ under the latest WineX from
Transgaming.  You *might* be able to run a Linux router and play EQ on the
same box! :-)

Yeah, that works.  There are a couple of bootable floppy router/firewall
projects for Linux (and a *BSD one or two, also).  If you put together a
cheap system to just be a firewall, I'd suggest going with a CD instead of a
floppy, for the extra flexibility.  With floppy drives ~$10 and CD drives
approximately ~$20, it's not much more expensive.  You can then use that
router boot floppy by making a bootable CD out of it, and you've then got
the option for going way beyond that and using something like Knoppix.
