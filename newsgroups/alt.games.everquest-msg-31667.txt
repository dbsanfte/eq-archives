Best  Advice I can give...which works for me is the Root/dot/dot method.
Start with root.  Head back to maximun range and cast your disease dot.
THAT stops them from healing back some of the damage over time.  Careful
though, because at higher lvls your DOT tends to break Root on contact.
Which is why you head to the maximum range to cast.  If Root breaks you
should be able to recast before getting hit.  If not, take the hit and get
the spell off.  Go ahead and med while Root/DoTs are in effect.  Remeber to
Have regen going on you at all times...and Canni to keep a ready supply of
mana.  Always try to sit far enough away that when root breaks you have time
to stand and cast it again before getting hit.  If you run low on
Mana...just keep rooting the MoB and med up.  If need be...mem a lower lvl
disease buff to keep the mob from healing.


I have tried the Pet method too.  That works as well.  Basically you start
with root.  Then SLOW...then you DD and DD and well...you get the idea.
When root breaks..and it will...you go ahead and melee it some.  Oh!  and
turn your pet's taunt off.  What you want to do is get as much argo on
yourself as posible.  Then...you start running.  With sow you should
outdistance these critters safely.  The MoB will follow you...your dog will
follow it, hitting it the entire time.  If it stops following you, turn
around and NUKE it to get its attention.  Your dog just cant take a beating
from the lvl Mobs you will need to be facing.


hope this helps
