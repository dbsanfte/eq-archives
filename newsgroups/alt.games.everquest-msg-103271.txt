I think it's pretty cool when the sleeper is woken up.   I know this
discussion has been beaten to death from both sides, I say kudos to the guys
for doing it even if a small group broke from the mainstream and took it
upon themselves.

These chuckle heads leaving the guild or whatever they're doing, well that's
fine if it makes them happy I suppose...  personally I'd love to be in a
guild that wakes the giant beast.  I think many are just angry that they
will never be part of that scenario, the rest are just pissed about the
loot.  Whatever.

My 2 cents.
