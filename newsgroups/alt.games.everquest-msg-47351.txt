For someone who likes to say so often "You don't know anything about me or
my family", you're really comfortable making generalizations about others,
aren't you? Actually, you're quite wrong about me. I've been saying for a
long time that something like this was going to happen. I dont live with my
head in the sand, I'm well aware of the risks inherent in the modern world.
The paranoia I speak of was not your assessment of the dangers afoot, but
your characterization of my comments as "barbs" and "subtle insults without
provocation". I had a chuckle at Paul's comment about your name. Hellloooo?
You have to admit, it's funny. Here you are, spouting false messages of doom
and you go by a name that is just dying to be misread as "False Doom". The
irony has been delicious and inescapable. I didn't raise it, but I had a
chuckle when Paul did. Call it a barb if you want, or a "subtle insult
without provocation" but if your skin is really that thin, you've got a lot
more to worry about than Sarin. ;-)

> My goal is to reasonably have some defenses

And there's the key word in your sentence: "reasonably". No one disputes the
notion that it pays to be prepared, the issue here is what can reasonably be
done and that comes down to at what price and for what benefit. So far, the
cost benefit analysis taking place in this thread doesn't support your views
in my opinion. What I don't understand is why you feel the need to come here
and tell everyone that you're doing this for their benefit and then call
them idiots when they disagree.

There you again with your invalid and insulting generalizations, as though
we were all like you. I read plenty more than game manuals, thank you. ;-)

Heh, I knew you couldn't help yourself. Eventually you were bound to explode
with the need to sling overt insults. And again with your generalizations. I
take all reasonable precautions to protect my family and loved ones, I
certainly don't need help from a sanctimonious little worm like you. But
then Phil was right; people were calling you an idiot long before you posted
this thread. ;-)
