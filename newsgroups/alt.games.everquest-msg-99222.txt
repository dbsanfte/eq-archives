*sigh*
One of my most stirring memories of the game. All my Troll's EQ life, I
had dreamed of getting up to the "Big Zones" and finally facing down
huge, unknown monsters that awaited there. I had grown up in the swamp,
and S. Ro, and was sick to death of killing froglocs and beetles. The
closest it got to interesting was going to King Xorb's Gorge and killing
muddites, since at least they *looked* different. But of course, that
got old too. But I persevered, killing my froglocs, beetles, and
muddites. And finally I grew up and got to level 50. With great
anticipation, I fought valiently to get my key to one of the BIG
ZONES.... Old Seb. Ah! Land of wonder, mystery and uberness. I could
finally go fight the mysterious powerful monsters who awaited me there,
and of which I'd dreamed and imagined for so long.

I zoned in the first time and got the guards camp.

"INCOMING"

WHAT THE FUCK???????????????????

/em sighs. Clearly disappointed.
