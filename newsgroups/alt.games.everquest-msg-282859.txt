It's up once again with some velious mobs added this year.  Already
I'm salviating over a fabled robe that drops in sleeper tomb but need
to get key for it :(

Fabled myga wiped a raid of 24 in just seconds with ae nuke of 5k+ and
fabled aow- forget it only uber guild has any chance of surviving 10k+
damages.  I'd hate to see how bad fabled PoP GOD would be next year.

3 different scavenger hunt quest, only 1 solved so far with cheesy
clicky firework item somewhat like the reward for retail OoW
expansion.  USELESS!!!
