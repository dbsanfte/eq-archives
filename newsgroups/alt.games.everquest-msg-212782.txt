I think it is because of summer.  My guild is down to maybe three people
when I play, because a lot of them are either college students who play
during the school year, or older people with families, who do family things
all summer with their kids being off from school.

I'd wait until school starts to see if things pick up, before seriously
starting another characters on another server.  However, goofing around on a
server with a different rule set, like FV, might be a fun way to pass the
time while waiting, or go try a bunch of different classes on Test (assuming
that /testbuf is still there, so you can boost them to 25).
