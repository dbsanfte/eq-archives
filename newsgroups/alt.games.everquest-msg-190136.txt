How obvious is that?  Or, is it just an assumption?  Do you have anything to
back up that "obviously"?

Oh?  How sure are you of that?  I haven't seen the taunt code, so I can't be
sure.

My taunt will never bee 230, but I can taunt well enough, even with a good
lead.  I guess I should try it on speaking mobs so I can be sure of exactly
what's going on...

Sounds like it to me.

Well, given the code of EQ, we still can't discount that possiblity, but it
does seem remote.

That was the inconclusive side of my argument.

If the "taunt plus one" people tried to say that, then they would be
contradicting their own claim.  If I have to worry about a hate lead from
the paladin, then it obviously isn't taunt plus one.  Hence, it is possible
to conclusively prove that the TP1 argument is false.  However, I believe
that TP1 is the correct model for how taunt works, so I doubt that it would
be the case.

You would need a speaking mob to do this correctly.  If the mob gives you
the "I'll teach you not to interfere with me" type speach, you know it was a
successful taunt.  If, after the successful taunt, the paladin still has
aggro, then you know TP1 is false.

> Once again, how exactly do you think this experiment will prove anything?

As explained above.  It can only disprove TP1 if it's inaccurate.  It is not
capable of proving it.
