For my example...

Person 1: "SOW me plz"

Me: "Ah, you asshole, you mother-fucker, you stupid son of a bitch! You are
the dumbest piece of shit I fucking know on this god damn planet! Fuck you,
fuck your Mom, fuck your Mom's dog, fuck your Mom's dog's cat's hamster, and
go to Hell! I don't owe you a god damn thing!"

Yeah, I really accomplished a lot with that statement... in fact, I just
made myself look like a jackass. For me, it's all about acting my age, or
above it.
