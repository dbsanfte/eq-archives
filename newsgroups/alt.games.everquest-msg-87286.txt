There are two portals to the outside.   At the end of South Wing, and at the
end of East Wing.   Both will port you to the temple entrance (not the orb).

The portals at the end of North and West both take you back to the zone in.

When you zone in, two mobs will aggro.   They will both be of the easiest
types for the place, but can be up to a 550 harm touch each.  They can be
either undead or normal, so invis doesn't help much.  Almost always at least
one of them will be undead.

There are 8 golems in the zone in area, 2 guarding each door.  They are not
close enough to aggro on zone in.  There is also a wanderer that goes out of
east wing door onto the platform, then back in.  Likewise, he will not be
close enough to aggro.

Even now with Luclin out so the loot isn't as good as it once was... it's
still one of my favorite zones in the game.  Incredible experience, completely
uncrowded, and most of all, fun.   You can wander around and explore the
entire place, tracking down names as you go.

(and one of these days I'll figure out the mystery of the keys and that damn
bloodstained glove.)
