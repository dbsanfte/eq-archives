I usually hit a few choice spots... Night now I'm soloing in PoN by
charming a blood raven and siccing him on treants & other ravens...
plus the occasional spider... GREAT exp. WHen I want cash, I go piss
everyone off in Cobalt Scar by quadding or in Burning Woods by
Root/rotting giants in the fort.

I DO hit a few dungeons as well... I duo with a Necro buddy of mine in
Veksars quite often, and I also hit the entrance or exit to Chardok
once in a great while. And yeah, I've been known to do an adventure or
two... Usually get stuck as Prime Healer, but we've been successfull
on about 66% of the adventures with me prime healing, so I guess
that's allright too.
