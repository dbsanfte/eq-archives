I know the two seem illogical when put together like this, but what I 
mean is, in a normal group it doesn't help you kill faster; it doesn't 
increase your DPS or make the mobs drop dead faster.

Soloing, or in a group where sitting down to regen hp is a vital part of 
the healing strategy, a larger HP total can increase your kills per 
hour... but still won't make any given mob drop dead any faster.
