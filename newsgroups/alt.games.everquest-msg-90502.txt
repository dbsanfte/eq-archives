UO would run in windowed mode.  And there were programs that would let
you write macros to click on hotkeys for you.  You could start a brand
new character, set up the right macro, go to bed, and when you woke up
you'd have all your melee related skills up to 50 (which i think was
the max for sparring dummy training) and have a stack of fish to turn
into fish cakes and sell to a vendor.  

You could do something similar to catch fish, or maybe max out sense
heading in EQ, but it wouldn't be as advantageous as it was in UO...


I always thought they disabled windowed mode to prevent the towns
being full of people macro'ing like UO towns always were.  If it was
doable, I'd be tempted to macro foraging in skyshrine.
