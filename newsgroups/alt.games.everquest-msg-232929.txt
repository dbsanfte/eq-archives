On my server (Mithaniel Marr), there is Team Japan (sorry...no website handy
atm) which is a coalition of very small Japanese guilds put together to
raid.  TJ has no problem with back flagging their applicants.

There is also Forsaken Realm (www.forsakenrealm.org).  Believe most of them
are based out of Sweden.  Good thing about FR is...they also don't care
about having to back flag.

Hope this helps.
