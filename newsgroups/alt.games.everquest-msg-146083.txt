I did about 3 1/2 blue last night, too, in about 5 hours of play, at 53,
bouncing around between Eastern Wastes (ulthorks men of war, manticores,
wholly rhinos) and Cobalt Scar (wyverns, one at a time, except for a couple
times I did two at once).  This didn't *seem* any worse than
normal...perhaps a little better.  I wasn't killing at the max rate: between
fights, I use racial hide, switch to the Linux machine, and read usenet or
answer email or browse, and sometimes forget about EQ for a bit.
