Aahahah.

That reminds me of a rather humorous skit or short film I saw once, I
can't remember the show but the wife was being arrested for
prostitution. It was a news media guy and he was saying "amazingly
enough this woman with no means of support of her own has been living
with this "husband" for 40 years and exchanging sexual favors for at
once time a food processor for a christmas gift .." etc, basically
comparing the old fashioned marriage to prostitution. The thing is,
the skit worked because it kind of rings true.
