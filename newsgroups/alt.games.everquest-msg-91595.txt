You are most likely right. The unfortunate part about these "whiners" lack of intelegent
and rational thought is that they will not be getting what they most desire. Most of them
(at least IMO) desire some form of public notirity and respect. By posting these whines,
they may get the public notiry but not the respect. Every single one of these type of
posts tends to cause people to have less and less respect for them. They are just to
ignorent to realize it.
