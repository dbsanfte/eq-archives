I would 100% recommend against *ever* buying EQ from ebay. The US version
of EQ works great, and I have both an original US account from 1999 and a
second account using evolutions that work here fine, but if you buy from ebay
you are risking somebody else having the code. At best, you just wasted
22 quid, at worst they let you play for 6 months, then take the account
back and steal all your gear + characters.

Buy it direct from Sony or a 1st hand retailer like Amazon.
