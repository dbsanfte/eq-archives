Aloha Max,
    Last night I picked up the 8500 because the 7200 is not supported 
under Lucin. Even with 512k of ram I had some video problems under my 
old ATI card. My knowledable friends inform me that the GeForce 4 would 
be the best for gaming and the ATI8500 would be the best "all around" 
card. As my girlfriend does other stuff besides gamming on this machine 
I have go with "she-who-must-be-obeyed" requirements as well as mine. -
