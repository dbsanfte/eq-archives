If you mean the most powerful <anything>, Any of the big shot GMs
(server/system guys, not the little apprentice GMs or a guide or anything)
or anybody on the devteam.

If you mean the most powerful MoB, Kerafyrm (AKA The Sleeper), especially
now that all the other big'uns are down (Vulak'Aerr, Avatar of War, and
Tunare (with her craptastic loot))

Not that he's so much HARD, as he only sticks around for like 6 seconds,
Bristlebane in PoM (and the fact that to get to PoM you have to go all the
way in to ToV, a hellish trip in and of itself...)
