    EB is a crutch. Our warriors that have been geared up hold aggro fine,
and they have gone down a number of different paths to do it. One, the big
one, has the most damaging weapons he could get (Jagged Shard of Frozen
Flame and The Rotting Fist). Another has a pair of EB one-handers
(Bloodfrenzy, Blade of Carnage) and the EB two-hander off Rallos Zek. Yet
another warrior has gone with as much Vengeance as he can physically pack
onto himself in a non-DKP guild. All three grab and hold aggro just as well
as the others.
