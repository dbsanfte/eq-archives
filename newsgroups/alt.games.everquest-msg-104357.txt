I use similar pauses to heal myself.  Rangers get a terrible heal and I
gotta cast it several times in a row to get enough benefit from it.  So I
programed a button to cast heal 5 times
/pause 45, /cast 1 (on 4 lines) and /cast 1 on the last,  last line I change
when I need it to cast camo too

I figured out pausing when I started a bard and wanted to twist songs
without clicking my life away.  Bard's buttons are set up like this
/pause 10, /stopsong
/pause 45, /cast 1
/pause 10, /stopsong
/pause 45, /cast 2

I fiddle around with the pauses till I find one that works with the songs
I'm using at the time.  Gotta make sure the pause after the cast is long
enough for the message about the song landing shows.  Made for me to be able
to have a button marked RunHeal and one I use for battles. Much easier to
sing if I don't have to hit the gem 2 times to get it to sing one song.
