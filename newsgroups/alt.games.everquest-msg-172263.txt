Different servers can vary in attitudes to new players. Some are 
friendly than others. The friendliest I have played on is Test- but it's 
also the most unstable.

Most servers are up reliably, although there are scheduled patches (as 
posted on EQ's website) and the occassional crash. But I've left trader 
mules on for a couple days straight with no problem.

I've never played AC2, so I can't tell you the differences between 
controls... but they make sense to me and I found them easy to cope with.

You can play on PVP server, or a server that doesn't have PvP except in 
designated arenas (or duels). The non-PvP servers are more popular.
