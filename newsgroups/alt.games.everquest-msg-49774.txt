I'm on Drinal and I'd love to buy and upgrade my stuff but it's just too
expensive right now for my level. I have a theory that upgrading usually
requires a factor of 10 more in cost. That first piece of equipment you
buy for a slot might cost 1pp, but then you'll be dishing out 10pp, then
100pp and then 1000pp for the significant upgrade for that slot. I'm at
the point where all my slots are filled with 500 to 1000pp+ items (at
the time I bought them) and upgrading them will cost a fortune. I'll
probably have to switch strategies and quest or dungeon crawl rather
than dishing out cash as I usually do.
