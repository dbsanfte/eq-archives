Because the majority of the people with roleplay on are not roleplaying.
They are hiding class and lvl to avoid giving Sow's, buffs or telelports.
Yes they could do that with anon but then their guild tag would not show.
I can "roleplay" my characters just as easily with or without /roleplay on.

Why would you penalize those who roleplay?
