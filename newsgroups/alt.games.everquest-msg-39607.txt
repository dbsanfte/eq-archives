My suggestion would be go to EC (or Nth FP, whatever is the Bazaar zone) and
sell all your decent, items for the most you can get for them, then keep the
plat, no drop and low end items on the character and leave it. by all means
post here what you want to sell (assuming you are asking plat for it and not
expecting anyone to fork out real ï¿½'s or $'s for it)
The reason I say this is you may one day want to play the pally again and
the chances are you're equipment will worth far less so you'll be able to
buy it back and have plat to spare or afford better items.
