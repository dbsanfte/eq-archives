I was using on my p2 400 with 512 meg ram, geforce 64 meg mx 400, so I
could move well in the bazaar. You are quite right, my female SK was
hilarious to me since I always play in third person from behind So I
can see myself (with view adjusted so my feet are about an inch above
bottom of screen) and see critter attacks from the rear. I found
myself overcome with nostalgia at seeing her, with the fun velious
texture barbed ringmail bp, and her big goofy smile. It did make me do
the old troll speak more. 

Now I got a celeron 1.8 hz cpu and new mboard, geforce 4 ti 4200 128
meg, tossed in my old stuff, so that I could enable luclin models and
move SLOWER than the above system (both setups with low textures,
clipping at 5 percent ;)  with the old models. I guess I am like
everyone else now, I could use the old models and REALLY fly in the
bazaar or on raids, but something about upgrading makes me have to use
the new models.. ahaha.

I'm afraid i can't do that. I either have all the new ones or all the
old. Otherwise they just don't go together well. One pretty kick ass
thing is that all the new NPCS in POP, such as in tranquility, have
the full gamut of cool velious various textures IF you use the old
models. This is kind of ironic. They have several types of leather,
such as the velious leather and that kelp leather texture, as well as
plate and chain and such.

I wish that they'd made the Luclin models like the originals, but more
polygons and updated somewhat. This would have probably made them
faster also. I mean, unless they threw away the original prototype
model saves, I'm sure they started out with much more detailed models
on the workstations they were on then shrunk them down for the
hardware of that day. 

The first thing I noticed with the new models was a loss of "charm",
especially on the ogres and trolls. Looking at EQ2, I notice the exact
same thing. The ogre is kind of similar to the luclin model one and is
just a big guy with little fangs, yay. The elves and humans shown look
like stock 3ds type models. I don't understand why they go more
realistic but to the point of smoothing the models down to where there
is no character.
