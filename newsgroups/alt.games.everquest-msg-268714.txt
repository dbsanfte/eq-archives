EQ2 lets you do this, *if they yell for help*. In other words, they have
to *want* your aid, and by doing so they forfeit the XP and loot... they're
stopping powerlevelling as well as griefing. I agree, its a loss of
immersiveness, but if I can get used to the hacks that are lore and no
drop, I guess this is just one more little thing, and its reasonably
elegant - take the risk for the loot, or get the help to survive.

And more to come, it seems... there are whole levels of skill and spell
trees that are meant to be unlocked by questing, but arent yet in the game
as I understand it.

I suppose you could debate whether they eever will be in the game, of course ;)
