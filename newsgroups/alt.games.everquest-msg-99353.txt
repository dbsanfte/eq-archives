yes necros - i have a 46 lvl necro and he solos in Dreadlands -

everyone else is grouping at that level or dieing -

Remember necros can fear kite and dot kite - and that pet they get is a
warrior about 5 levels below them  - so u get a 40th level tank with a
darkness and fear and just about anything is going to run away getting
smoked by the pet -
