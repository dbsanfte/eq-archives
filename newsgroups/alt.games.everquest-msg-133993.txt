HEAL.  HEAL.  HEAL.

If the buff in question has an HP component (Valor, or whatever you have at
your level), then it will increase total HP also (as a heal) and might save
them, but NEVER cast an AC-only or non-hp buff over a heal if you're in a
dire situation, especially if you're the only healer.  (obviously if someone
else can save him, but you're the only one that can cast a certain buff,
that buff *might* be more useful than *you* saving him, just make sure he
*does* get saved)

Exceptions of course can come in certain raid situations, but I somehow
doubt that's what you were asking.
