Not to mention the fact that many of us who did manage to
access the server selection screen were unable to log in
due to this crash-to-desktop error when attempting to log
in to our servers.

"EQGAME has caused an error in EQGFX_DX8.DLL ...
EQGAME will now close"

A lot of folks on the chat server are now complaining about
this.  The message scrolling across the top of the chat window
says those crashing "without an error message" need to update
their video drivers to version 22.80 though they neglect to
mention the manufacturer or chip set. (!)

All I can say is that logged out this morning, 5 minutes before
the scheduled patch, shut down my PC and kept it off until 1:30PM.
I then patched and attempted to log back in with the result noted
above.  :-(

Once again it appears that the patch will have to be patched.
