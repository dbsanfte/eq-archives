Twinking, giving equipment or money to another character (your alternative
character or a friends etc) that they have not gained by their own means and
normaly could not gain for some levels.

Example 1 a 30th level Warrior in Cobalt armour wielding 2 lamentations
(equipment you could not get until hi 40's to low 50's..mid 50's if you
include the Breast Plate) is a twink...there is no way he looted those items
or earn the money to pay for it.

Example 2 a 10th level Warrior in full Fine Plate armour armour and a pair
of Crystallised swords. Again, he couldn't loot the weapons and could not
afford the (player made) armour. Someone bought/looted it for him.

It is much hated by most newbies, when you see a character lower level than
you in shiny plate mail when you're wearing Raw hide and patchwork it is a
little frustrating but you get used to it and normally will end up doing the
same thing yourself.
