Our guild and our allied guild have lots of druids and
rangers, and we hold periodic CoM raids to try and 
obtain Jade Reavers for them - but we've run into a
snag - Namely that the rogue we had lined up to get
us in won't be able to show.

I've heard that it's possible to GFlux a mage past the
locked parts (I know the elevator is locked, is there
also a locked gate?) and have him CoTH the raid in.

Now, I'm less than 3 blue to 55 and have CoTH in the bank,
and will easily be 55 before the scheduled time of the
raid, and would like to give my guild an option other
than a rogue to get in.

So, if anyone has ever done this, and knows the trick, 
could you please give me a bit of info? 

Thank you very much
