Yup only thing that could be done is challenge the legality of EULAs which
really lost most of its bite since major software started putting the fact
there was a license with further conditions plainly on the box or made the
license visible at point of purchase, or to try and force a condition to
be declared unreasonable and that wouldnt make the whole contract invalid
anyway just the unreasonable part of it...either of which requires a court
decision and not a simple "i think....' to do it (and before anyone gets
onto the case yes I am aware of the whole 'if they dont find out then
everyone in the trade is happy' concept..I just dont view it as anything
other than taking a chance)

All in all it seems a standard 'Im gonna do it anyways'.....
