True. Also, I remember it was a very difficult (by difficult I mean
tedious) and very inconvenient. Part of the evil to good quest
involved killing 500 gnolls and several named mobs in the sub-20 level
area around Qeynos - a city you could not enter for resupply until you
had completed the quest, and even then many merchants gave you a hard
time. Plus, just *getting* to the lands around Qeynos from Freeport
was a lengthy and harrowing trek, so it wasn't like you were going to
make trips back and forth while working on the quest.

I tried out several different classes in EQ2. I really liked the
enchanter classes and the necromancer, but I just couldn't stand the
"pant suits" all the robe-wearing casters were stuck with. They looked
retarded.
