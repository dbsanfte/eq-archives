I'm running a GeForce 4 on an Athlon 2000+ machine.

For quite a while now, if I switched to windowed mode, it would work fine, 
but if I tried to switch back, it would keep EQ in a window, but make the 
window go black.  So, if I ever went to windowed mode, I could never go 
back to un-windowed mode without logging out and making the switch at the 
server-select screen or one of the other earlier screens.  I can 
continually switch between the normal windowed mode and the "black screen" 
windowed mode if I want, but that's not quite acceptable.

My NVidia drivers were a little old - I didn't have any problems other than 
this, so I had no need to upgrade - but I finally decided to go to DX9 and 
the latest NVidia drivers last Friday.  I still have the problem I had 
before and now have the gamma problem, which doesn't bother me as I don't 
play in windowed mode except when I get there accientally.

Any clue on what is keeping my machine from going back to full-screen mode?  
The only thing that comes to mind is that I may be playing EQ in a 
different resolution than I keep my desktop and that may be messing it up.  
I need to check that.
