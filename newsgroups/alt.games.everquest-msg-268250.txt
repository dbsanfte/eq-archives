You can solve problems like this by grabbing everything you've got that you
think *might possibly* be the intended ingredient then bringing up the
recipe on the appropriate device (forge for smithing, chem table for
alchemy, et cetera).  First, you'll see what item(s) it selected.  Then when
you click "change" beside the item, you'll see all of the items you were
carrying that are considered viable alternatives.  That's how I found out
that in the dye recipes Isonoid Loam can be used in place of Isonoid
Reagent.
