Ok, I read a few weeks, maybe months ago about playing cards that drop
in a plane or the planes.  First, clarification on this anyone?  Second,
I heard that you combine them in some kind of deck you get in Erudin.
Again, clarification?  Third, my friend has a King card of Erudin or
something like that, and it "WAS DROPPED BY" a guard in Qeynos hills.  I
repeat it did not "DROP" off him when the guard died, the guard actually
said "Ooops, did I drop something?"  and my friend ran over and picked
up a playing card.  WTF?!  If you need an actual name I'll post it
tomorrow when I ask him but I'm assuming there wouldn't be a whole lot
of different sets of playing cards.  Finally, a sum total clarification
anyone?  Thanks.
