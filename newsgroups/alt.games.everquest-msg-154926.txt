Some acquaintances of mine in the Zeb guild, Stone supposedly had one of
their raids recorded for 48 Hours (set up in one of the guild member's
home).  I meant to ask them what they ended up raiding and whether or not
they wiped. <g>  I recommended Fear 'cause it's a cool looking zone, though
all the other raid guilds will make fun of them for going to an easy zone
(for their caliber).

'Course it'll probably get about 10 seconds air time so I still won't know
even if I remember to watch it.
