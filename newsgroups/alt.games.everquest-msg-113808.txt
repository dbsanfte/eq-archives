I think a lot of you are getting way too worked up over something as
insignificant as SOW.  If you have a problem with the occasional rejection
of a sow, look for anohter druid, save for tboots, camp jboots, or if your
50+ get runspeed 3.  Your going to work for that anyway.

Druids and Shaman are everywhere, if someone say no move on.  If you are a
druid or shaman just resolve yourself that you are going to get asked for a
SOW.  Make a social key, for "/r Sorry, cant help you at this time, busy
with some things" or "/r fuck off" whatever you like.

I can understand not wanting to be bothered, my suggestion.  Go anon.  Why
the hell not?  People seeing your level and class in who is for two reasons:
1) to see if you want to group,  2) to see if you can buff/help them, oh I
guess ill venture a third: 3) Boost your own ego
