Aye - I've read many "You shoulda known before you chose your character"
arguments. Doesn't really apply to high level druids now. When I rolled
mine, druids could port a couple of zones away from anywhere in Norrath. Not
anymore. Druids were pretty desirable healers, but with ever increasing hit
points on other character classes - and MOB's that can take them away. Not
anymore. They used to be decent buffers, now every buff other than Cold and
Fire resists (soon to be nerfed) - is not useful to groups.

 I love my druid (not bitter about the class, just the bashers) - I play him
all the time in groups with friends and I still would not change classes
(even if I had the time). But things are MUCH different now than when I
originally chose druid. I do hope your wife does not grow frustrated with
the cleric after they finally give Paladins 96% rez, and CH items to tanks
of all types. I doubt many clerics will be happy after Verant introduces
"Soul Rezzers" in every zone. I can't wait for them, they will be handy. But
even all that will be irrelavent after Verant just does the no exp loss,
appear fully dressed rules up to level 60.

With the changes being made to the game, trying to judge what your
character's usefulness will be in a year is futile. The "You shoulda known"
argument is asinine in light of these changes.
