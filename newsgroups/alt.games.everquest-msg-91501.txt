    The spell turns you. When you're on a horse, you point in the direction
of the horse always. And we know the horse is a separate entity....

    What I want to know is the following: when passing through Butcherblock
to get to GFay spires recently, my little warrior decided to up Kaladim
rogue faction by clearing a Butcherblock bandit camp.

    Gundl at the camp closest to GFay zone now gives a Beta Neutral faction
hit. Yeowch.

    Petitioned, "Nope, that's wrong, could you /bug that please? Thanks!" I
mean, how did they mess THAT up?
