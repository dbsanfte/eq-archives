Irrelevant.

Beta slots are traditionally extremely rare, which is a well known trend.
If you want to be "assured" a beta slot, you *must* buy LoE, and you must do
it by January 4? when the offer runs out.  You will not know if you got one
of the "free" beta slots until after you have made the decision on the
purchase or not.

The one in 50,000 chance of winning a beta slot if you choose not to make
the purchase is not enough to influence my decision on the purchase.   The
odds are just too low.   So the difference is immaterial.
