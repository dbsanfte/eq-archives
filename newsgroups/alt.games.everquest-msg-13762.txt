1) You don't say which server you're on - it might be worth me looking, or
it might not, and I don't have that much free time.
2) Level 1-5 corpses last 30 minutes before decaying, level 6 and up last 24
hours while logged on (i.e. past server select screen) and 7 days while NOT
logged on (unless they're empty, when it's 3 minutes for all levels). I'm
guessing that your 30 minutes are up.
3) Try asking in-game; a bard or necromancer might be able to find it for
you. If you type /corpse and you're told "You have no corpses in this zone",
you've decayed already. Sorry.
