With the PoR expansion, Alchemy was totally revised.  The names of the
potions and the reicpes to create them all are new.  Furthermore, now the
potions are created as single-dose stacking only, no more large units that
spend down.  Specifically, what was Blood of the Wolf is now called Philter 
of the Wolf IV.  There are other Philter of the Wolf too, numbered I through 
V, including that one IV.  The difference among them is speed of travel.
