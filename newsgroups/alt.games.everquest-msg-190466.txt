That easy.  Look for items that there are a lot of, then look for guys who
are way underselling the average.  You begin to see the patterns if you
spend much time in the bazaar.  I don't have a second account, so when I'm
selling, it's my regular character there in the bazaar.  Even if I'm there,
I set him to AFK, because while the character is doing the selling, I'm
doing market research.  A lot of people complain about the auctioning and
shouts in the bazaar.  I don't even notice them, because the /bazaar and
/trader panels are sitting over the regular conversation panel.

Cheers,
Eric
