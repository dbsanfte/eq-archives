That's just bullshit.  Maybe true for well-geared L65s with piles of
AA and 4k+ mana pools, but certainly not for ordinary mid-50s groups.
All it takes is a few ill-timed resists and/or failures to resist
on a messy pull and your mezzer is down.  Now the difference between
survival or a wipe is likely to be determined by how much mana your
Cleric (and possibly other heal capable characters) has.  And if
you're working without a net (no Enchanter, Bard, or Necro) it's
even easier to get yourselves into the sort of trouble that will
wipe a low on mana group.

Just my $.02

And now we return you to round four of Faned vs. Bergh...
