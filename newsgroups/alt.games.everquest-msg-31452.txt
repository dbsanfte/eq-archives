 Walk in.

 Fear has a portal in Ferrott.

 Growth has a brain looking thing in Wakening Lands you click on.

 Mischief is in a rather nasty area of Temple of Veeshan. I'm guessing
you just click on the house thing as well.

 Hate and Sky you need a Wizard since they require a component to get
there. Although I think Phara Dars exit pad dumps you in Plane of Air.
We normally don't take that one. Any other VPers out there who can
verify?
