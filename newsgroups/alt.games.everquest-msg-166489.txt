What I've since learned in additional experimenting is that seems to be a
display issue. Health is increasing (my Light Healing at level 17 heals 32
hp), but my wife's Warrior has enough HP so that 32 hp doesn't necessarily
register on the magical red bar.

And I'm glad it did! I recall when the spell book filled my whole face.

So the only difference is the convenience? I had hoped for more to make it a
more valued experience. I may still pursue Alchemy even if the financial
rewards aren't there because (as with the Totemic armor quests), it is part
of my culture as a Shaman! But I'll have to assess that as I approach the
relevant time frames.

Thank you, I hope to see you on the battlefield!
