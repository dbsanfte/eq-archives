My roommate did some tests with others in his guild.  All were L60 warriors.
They used an assortment of weapons.  Apparently the warrior epic's proc is
just enough to make it marginally better than other weapons.  It looks like
Varant did the math on a lot of things, and made the epic a hair better.

However, for a lot less time and trouble you can get a pair of Bloodpoint
and out taunt a heck of a lot of things.  The life drain proc counts as
damage, and additionally 90% of it counts as a heal.  When dual wielding
them that adds up to a bunch of extra taunting.

Now consider the fact that it takes a guild to get a warrior epic, but only
a good party to get a Bloodpoint.  Not a whole bunch of reason to get the
epic.  If it had one less delay, my roomie would be screaming to get one.
Then it would be obviously better.  But as part of class balancing, the
issue of changing the warrior epic is closed.  Varant stated that many times
in San Diego at the Fan Fair.
