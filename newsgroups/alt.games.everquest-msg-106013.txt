i top posted on purpose, this thread is ridiculous long ;p
and it is easy to tell that one top posted on purpose.
show me how one can tell whether you can't resist posting or you want to
post? hahahahaha

and how much  college do you have under your belt? (since you believe

so far i've agreed with your posts in general, but your fallacy comment
i found very humorous in light of the fact that you have added just as
much to the thread as anyone.
do you have a sense of humor?
