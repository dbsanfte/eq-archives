However, who says SOE's is the only business model that works. NCSoft
seems to be looking at having lots of moderately successful games out on
the market rather than one blockbuster, and I can't say that that might
not work out for them quite well over the years. If you can make a
profit on 50k users and have a lot of games like that, great.

Look at EA. One former big hit, UO, and countless duds since, most of
which were expected to be huge like Sims Online. Even SOE hasn't
repeated EQ's success with anything they've put out since. The time of
400k+ user games may be over.
