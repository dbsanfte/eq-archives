But spell research is A) easy to keep capped...just spend the 5 free points
you get every level on it, and there's very little work to do and B) entirely
unnecessary, as far as I can see, easy enough to buy your spells of
a "research trader" or have a guild mate do the combine.  Is there a
no drop spell or two at high levels you can't get otherwise, for any class?

If its research keeping you from trying other classes, you might want
to reconsider.
