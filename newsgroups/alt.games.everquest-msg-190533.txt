I know what you're talking about.  Lightsources in EQ don't work the way a
light source should.  I've submitted feedback about this all the way back to
Beta 3 with never a hint at a resolution.

If you stand in a good spot (outdoors) the immediate area around you is lit
and fades away from you.  Great.  But then take 15 steps forward and you're
standing in complete darkness and can't see the ground beneath your feet.
What the hell?!?

Sure deters one from being a newbie human or erudite.
