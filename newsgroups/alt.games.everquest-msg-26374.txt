Well I can see this is something you take very seriously so my only
choice is to continue to make jokes on the subject:

What you say is all well and good, but how can you truly appreciate the
value of a committed, long term relationship till you've experienced the
torment of a series of meaningless physical relationships?  I know that
my current agreement with you on the value of such committed
relationships is directly related to the years I spent whoring around
when I was younger, without which I am not sure I would feel the same.

hmmm, maybe I'm not joking after all <G>
