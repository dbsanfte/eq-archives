I spoke of relative rarity of griefing. There were dozens of instances,
from abusive powerlevelers, kill stealers, careless constant trainers,
deliberate trainers, quest mob snipers, abusive twinks, camp thieves,
and more. Just because I don't still seethe from those incidents over
the last 5 years doesn't mean that for many of them I wasn't anywhere
from annoyed to pissed off.

Most of the time there was little I could do to get justice. Even if I
had been on a PVP server, 90% of the time I would have been ill
equipped to retaliate.

bizbee, as to your responses, first, my point here was that if the
majority of a server is able and willing to choose to powerlevel
quickly to max level, there will be few people for true newbies to play
with. That will have an impact in the midlife of a game, past the
initial rushes, and is why I believe so much work was put to make low
level EQ so easy to get through in the last few years. Are you denying
this is a reasonable design consideration?

Your freeway analogy is a trifle odd, when you consider how much effort
is put into keeping people from accidentally going the wrong way.
Meanwhile the effort to completely prevent any such accident would be
much more difficult than the effort to modify a game you are in the
process of designing; so much so that the analogy falls completely
flat. I will concede that it's possible that making an online world
where griefing is totally impossible might wind up as so stale and
uninteresting as to kill the world quickly. That's where the difference
lies between the highway and the game: cost is more important in the
former, while an enjoyable game is more important in the latter
(hopefully).
