But ICS is just microsoft's name for their implementation of NAT.
It forwards the same packets as NAT, in the same way. It sets up the
same translations for protocols like ftp that wouldn't otherwise work.

It provides DHCP so clients get a suitable set up. You can use it to
share an internet connection with any kind of machine, it's not just a
windows thing.

I used to have a linux machine with IP masquerading set up but now I
have a windows 2000 machine using ICS and they work exactly the same
way.

Anyway, this is hardly the correct forum to discuss this...
