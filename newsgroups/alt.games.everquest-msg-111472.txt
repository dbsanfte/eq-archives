    Just don't answer. It drives them batty. They don't know if you went LD,
if you're thinking about it or talking to friends about what to offer, and
they really want to leave EC. It's the only method I've found to drag a
price out of someone like that, and it doesn't always work.

    I talked to one trader (a professional, always-in-EC trader) about this
and he had another perspective. Whenever you DO set a price, if it's
reasonable then the first offer you get will invariably be discounted from
your set price. "50 pp for my Foozzle of Fondness!" "D00d, I have 35 pp and
some pocket lint. Ok?" You've likely seen this if you ever try to sell
there. So by not stating a price, they force the chronic discounter to make
a first offer - and they're more likely to offer in the "reasonable" range
for fear of being mocked. "35 pp for a Foozzle of Fondness? WTF, noob!" I've
tried to avoid the whole mess by twinking friends and trading item for item
rather than selling as much.
