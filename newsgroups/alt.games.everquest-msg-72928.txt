I'm guessing it's a full suit of Rubicite. Old St. Nick is old school.

"Twas the night before Christmas," refers to him as a "Jolly Old Elf."
Since he does also look like a gnome on occasions, a dwarf or a human
on others, this limits his class possibilities to enchanter, rogue, or
bard.

I think it's safe to assume that he's not Tier'dal. Believe me. We
would have heard.

The rate of speed he travels at would definitely indicate a bard. But,
I suspect that actually comes from his magical pre-nerf reindeer,
whose effects stack when you chain summon them.

I've got to go with rogue, based on his ability to get in and out of
houses with such ease. So, Santa is a High Elf rogue.
