On top of Lance's suggestions (and since he missed your profile)

Black Alloy Medallion to replace the Iron one. AC6 +5wis/int Mana Preserv II
The only trouble is, from what I've seen in the bazar, these are getting
farmed a lot.
Drop in Runnyeye off of Battlewizard, Lord Pickclaw and others (had one from
slayspell before)
You're the right level to hunt there but will have to get a group together
first, not a good place for pickups, if you're hunting with none twinks the
place has some decent drops.

Couple of bought Items (Player made) Acrylia Studded Mask AC5 +5wis +5cha
and Othmir Fur Cap AC3 +2agil +3dex +6wis (no graphic) both of these are
very cheap now, about 150pp each.

Mammoth Hide Cloak from Goblin Alchemist in Permafrost is another item you
could camp yourself (with friends)
This item might be quite cheap to buy now the Acrylia cloaks are about.

When you pass 40 I'd try and get into a group hunting Guardians in
SkyShrine, see if you can't get a set of Guardian Legs
AC12 +4str +4wis +5cha +5magic +15cold +15fire +15HP

Also try looking up Hollow Shade Moore (Luclin) on Allakhazam's, at your
level with a full group you could take advantage of the war for some nice
caster and melee drops off of the named spawns.
