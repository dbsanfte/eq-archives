Just a simple question I have about the waterfall at the entry to Thurgadin.
I can't SEE it!  I can hear it fine but all I ever see is a blank wall with
a hint of a doorway shimering in it.  From the Thurg side, I can see out
perfectly (but not pick PC's or NPC's on the other side of where the
waterfall is.)  I have tried messing with serverside filtering, showspells
and such but no luck.  Comments?

I will eventually post this to the tech support boards but I thought I would
run it by you all and see how common this is.
