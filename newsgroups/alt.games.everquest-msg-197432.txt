	Once the initial splitters left over the flags issue, we began bleeding at
the pores from collateral damage.  Some couldn't stand the stress.  Some
followed their cliques.  Some decided the people who were left weren't
interesting enough to continue to hang around with.  Some left because we lost
critical mass for raids.  It was definitely the flags issue that started the
chain reaction.

	Almost everyone who has left the guild has also left the game, for what
that's worth.
