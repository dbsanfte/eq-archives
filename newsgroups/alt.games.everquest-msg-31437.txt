Hmm, as to the no metal armour...there are some pretty fancy range pieces
at high level, plus varius self only buffs...I always assumed from the way
warrior friends of mine progressed the simple number of hit points that
you can take was going to be the biggest issue....

I found poor ac difficult in the early levels as people started pulling in
above banded and chains...so when crafted plate became an option......plus
for versatility and fitting in studded and reinforced aint that bad....

ALso can wear ANY of the elf racial armours as far as I can see....always
wondered if they can wear human stuff (with the other half so to speak)
which is fun if thats yer thing...you lose the making of that stuff as as
option though
