What's bitter about it?  What part of my post is incorrect?

Yup, a couple that plays together stays together but not every spouse wants
to play EQ.  And when they don't, they may get pissed off at all the time
their spouse is wasting in-game when they should be paying attention to
THEM.  They might tell the player "you have to quit that game or I'm
leaving," and the player says "bye."  The spouse leaves and blames it on the
player.
The player realizes how much he/she has lost and then incorrectly blames EQ
instead of saying, "Boy, I'm a freaking IDIOT."
