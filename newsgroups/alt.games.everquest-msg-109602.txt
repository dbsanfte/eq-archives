Except its not ; go to the grey sometime and take a well equipped monk. If
you watch you will notice not only do they kill blue mobs they do so taking
no dammage . They can do this continously. You can watch them do the same
thing in fungus grove whacking shrooms.

My monk at 55 can solo both shrooms and the blue katta leggionaries. What he
cant do is pull them well. However he can easily manage many other places
such as solb, lower guk , or even the rockhopper caves in dawnshroud. In
other words not only can he solo for exps now he can handle mobs that will
still be blue at 60. My monk is well equipped by normal standards but since
he is a twink is not nearly as well equipped as our real monks. They make
his petty soloing ability look trivial. Then again so do all the other
combat classes in any big raiding guild.
