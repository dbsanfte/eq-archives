This is cute. Finally got through the patch mess, hit Luclin Registration,
after accepting my key it tells me that since I have 384 Mb RAM, I need 
to select 10 new character models out of the 18 (?) total for "optimal
performance". I checked them all anyway and it gave me a warning that
Everquest might have problems starting since I exceeded their 
recommendations. Sure enough, it hung and I'm patching again.

256 Mb recommended, huh? Sheesh.
