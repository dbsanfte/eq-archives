Don't worry about it...It only greys out to demonstrate that you can't make
two different kinds of attacks at once. Next time against a low green put
something cheap into your range slot like a rusty ax or club and target a
mob. Hit your range key and it will throw this weapon at the mob. You will
lose the weapon whether you hit or miss the mob. If you are able to put a
bow in the range slot and arrows in the ammo, you can use them to pull with
instead of mana or running right up to the mob and using the regular auto
attack melee key. Nice range pulling trick for warriors that most never seem
to use.
