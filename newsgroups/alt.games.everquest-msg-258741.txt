Of course, the fact is, if you don't intend to buy SoL and thereby gain 
access to the Bazaar, then there is not a huge reason for generating plat 
quickly to be a major concern aside from saving up to buy spells. You're a 
warrior, so that's not a problem.

Even without the Bazaar available, you should never buy gear from a 
merchant. They are crazy over-priced. You're better off just doing an 
/auction periodically wherever you happen to be for whatever you're in the 
market for. <dangling prepositions be damned :P>
