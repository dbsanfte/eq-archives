Personally I think SOE knows that the people still playing EQ will
continue to play EQ regardless of a billing mistake like this.  There
may be a few who decide to cancel, that this was the last straw, but
really it will be lost in the noise.

At least that's how I see it.  If they were trying to charge a one
time membership fee then that might be a different story.
