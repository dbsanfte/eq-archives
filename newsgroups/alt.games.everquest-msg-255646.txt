It's not that obvious.

The only thing that is obvious is that the server knows something that
allows it to verify that the password you enter is correct.  That doesn't
have to be the password itself.

For example, the classic Unix password system stored a fixed string
encrypted with your password.  When you logged in, it took the password you
entered, encrypted the fixed string using that, and compared to the stored
encrypted string.  If they matched, it deduced that the password was
correct.
