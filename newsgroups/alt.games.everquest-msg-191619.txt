Subject: Direct3d problems with RAGE video card

I have a RAGE IIC AGP video card which I'll admit isn't very advanced.  I
decided I wanted to play Everquest again a few weeks ago, and I've been
struggling since then to update and configure my computer the right way.  I
have seen posts on the net about people with this exact video card and Windows
98 (just like me) who can get the game to work.  

My problem is running the Direct3d tests from DXDIAG.  It does the Direct3d 7
test and then skips 8 and 9.  I really think I have the most updated drivers,
although the newest ones on ATI's website seem to be a couple years old.. I've
downloaded all kinds of drivers from driverguide.com and other places, hoping
something would work.

If anyone has any advice OR currently plays with an older RAGE product (RAGE
IIC, IIC AGP, PRO, etc..) please I would appreciate a reply here or in emails
with any advice.
