> THE PRICE WE PAY: My name is Adam Mayblum. I am alive today. I am
committing
> this to "paper" so I never forget. SO WE NEVER FORGET. I am sure that
this
> is one of thousands of stories that will emerge over the next several
days
> and weeks.  I arrived as usual a little before 8am. My office was on
the
> 87th
> floor of 1 World Trade Center, AKA: Tower 1, AKA: the North Tower.
Most of
> my
> associates were in by 8:30m.  We were standing around, joking around,
eating
> breakfast, checking emails, and getting set for the day when the first
plane
> hit just a few stories above us. I must stress that we did not know
that it
> was a plane. The building lurched violently and shook as if it were an

> earthquake. People screamed. I watched out my window as the building
seemed
> to move 10 to 20 feet in each direction. It rumbled and shook long
enough
> for
> me to get my wits about myself and grab a co-worker and seek shelter
under a
> doorway. Light fixtures and parts of the ceiling collapsed. The
kitchen was
> destroyed. We were certain that it was a bomb. We looked out the
windows.
> Reams of paper were flying everywhere, like a ticker tape parade. I
looked
> down at the street. I could see people in Battery Park City looking
up.
> Smoke
> started billowing in through the holes in the ceiling. I believe that
there
> were 13 of us.
>
> We did not panic. I can only assume that we
> thought that the worst was over. The building was standing and we were

> shaken
> but alive. We checked the halls. The smoke was thick and white and did
not
> smell like I imagined smoke should smell. Not like your BBQ or your
> fireplace
> or even a bonfire. The phones were working. My wife had taken our 9
month
> old
> for his check up. I called my nanny at home and told her to page my
wife,
> tell her that a bomb went off, I was ok, and on my way out. I grabbed
my
> laptop. Took off my tee shirt and ripped it into 3 pieces. Soaked it
in
> water. Gave 2 pieces to my friends. Tied my piece around my face to
act as
> an
> air filter. And we all started moving to the staircase. One of my
dearest
> friends said that he was staying until the police or firemen came to
get
> him.
> In the halls there were tiny fires and sparks. The ceiling had
collapsed in
> the men's bathroom. It was gone along with anyone who may have been in

> there.
> We did not go in to look. We missed the staircase on the first run and
had
> to
> double back. Once in the staircase we picked up fire extinguishers
just
> incase.  On the 85th floor a brave associate of mine and I headed back
up to
> our office to drag out my partner who stayed behind. There was no air,
just
> white smoke. We made the rounds through the office calling his name.
No
> response. He must have succumbed to the smoke. We left defeated in our

> efforts and made our way back to the stairwell. We proceeded to the
78th
> floor where we had to change over to a different stairwell. 78 is the
main
> junction to switch to the upper floors. I expected to see more people.
There
> were some 50 to 60 more. Not enough. Wires and fires all over the
place.
> Smoke too. A brave man was fighting a fire with the emergency hose. I
> stopped
> with to friends to make sure that everyone from our office was
accounted
> for.
> We ushered them and confused people into the stairwell. In retrospect,
I
> recall seeing Harry, my head trader, doing the same several yards
behind me.
> I am only 35. I have known him for over 14 years.  I headed into the
> stairwell with 2 friends.
>
> We were moving down very orderly in
> Stair Case A. very slowly. No panic. At least not overt panic. My legs
could
> not stop shaking. My heart was pounding. Some nervous jokes and
laughter.  I
> made a crack about ruining a brand new pair of Merrells. Even still,
they
> were right, my feet felt great. We all laughed. We checked our cell
phones.
> Surprisingly, there was a very good signal, but the Sprint network was

> jammed. I heard that the Blackberry 2 way email devices worked
perfectly. On
> the phones, 1 out of 20 dial attempts got through. I knew I could not
reach
> my wife so I called my parents. I told them what happened and that we
were
> all okay and on the way down. Soon, my sister in law reached me. I
told her
> we were fine and moving down. I believe that was about the 65th floor.
We
> were bored and nervous. I called my friend Angel in San Francisco. I
knew he
> would be watching. He was amazed I was on the phone. He told me to get
out
> that there was another plane on its way. I did not know what he was
talking
> about. By now the second plane had struck Tower 2. We were so deep
into the
> middle of our building that we did not hear or feel anything. We had
no idea
> what was really going on. We kept making way for wounded to go down
ahead of
> us. Not many of them, just a few. No one seemed seriously wounded.
Just some
> cuts and scrapes. Everyone cooperated. Everyone was a hero yesterday.
No
> questions asked. I had co-workers in another office on the 77th floor.
I
> tried dozens of times to get them on their cell phones or office
lines. It
> was futile. Later I found that they were alive. One of the many
miracles on

> day of tragedy.
>
> On the 53rd floor we came across a very heavyset
> man sitting on the stairs. I asked if he needed help or was he just
resting.
> He needed help. I knew I would have trouble carrying him because I
have a
> very bad back. But my friend and I offered anyway. We told him he
could lean
> on us. He hesitated, I don't know why. I said do you want to come or
do you
> want us to send help for you. He chose for help. I told him he was on
the
> 53rd floor in Stairwell A and that's what I would tell the rescue
workers.
> He

>
> On the 44th floor my phone rang again. It
> was my parents. They were hysterical. I said relax, I'm fine. My
father said
> get out, there is third plane coming. I still did not understand. I
was kind
> of angry. What did my parents think? Like I needed some other reason
to get
> going? I couldn't move the thousand people in front of me any faster.
I know

was. My

K-9

> without the dogs, anyone with a badge, started coming up as we were
heading

people

building.

that.

at all.

The

Twisted

I did

five.

girl on

My

out.

them.
