The ONE thing that ALL of these games have taught me is there is less
of a spirit of cooperation in this world today than there ever has
been.... Especially from the younger crowd. There is a HUGE selfish
streak that runs through many people today and they could care less
about the other guy so long as they get what they want and need.

Not the world I envisioned in my youth by a long shot.
