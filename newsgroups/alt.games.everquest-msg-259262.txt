I) Warrior
II) Knight/Bard/Cleric
III) Ranger/Rogue/Shaman/Berserker
IV) Beastlord/Druid
V) Monk
VI) Int Caster

I put warriors on a different "table" even though it's probably the same
table as the other plate classes, because they have a bonus that affects the
entire range of hits.  Same reasoning for monks being on their own table,
except it's a penalty.

And clerics are definitely on the same table as the other plate classes. 
The difference is they don't have (or don't have the same skill caps on)
dodge/parry/riposte/block, plus they tend to not have the same support AAs,
though most of those AAs are available to them.  On top of that, even though
they wear plate they usually have considerably lower AC (and hp) than the
warriors/knights (same applies to bards).

Yet another factor.

There are tables for offense as well.  There are fewer, with the bulk of the
classes grouped into one table and skill caps making the difference in
offense capability.

Mitigation.  Avoidance seems to be a single table for all classes.

Anecdotal evidence, but from watching the beatdown berserkers get when they
steal aggro from a plate tank, they're definitely not on the plate table.
