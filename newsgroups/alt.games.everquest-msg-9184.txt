Needing to recast during downtime is not the issue...

Yes you can.  And as long as you remember to do so quite often
during quiet times, the casting time is not an issue.

But one drawback of the JBoots effect is that its total duration
is quite a bit shorter than SoW, so you have more opportunities
for it to run out at an awkward time after you've been distracted
for a while and forgotten to refresh it.

I've lost count of the number of times I've had my JBoots run out
and thought to myself, "damn, I thought I just cast that not more
than a few minutes ago..."  And a goodly portion of those times
have been during battle.

The shorter duration a buff is, the harder it is to remember to
refresh it on time, every time.

Not to mention those times you'll be parked medding, tradeskilling,
chatting, afk, or whatever, only to suddenly get jumped by something
unexpectedly and discover that your fast-feet ran out a while back
because you didn't think you'd be needing it.  Zero-cast-time to
the rescue.

With perfect play, a 1.5 second cast time (or longer) is no
disadvantage versus a 0.0 second cast time.  In practice, however,
none of us are perfect all the time, and in lord-knows-how-many
hours of play will have many times that a 0.0 cast time will turn
out to be a lifesaver after all.
