Since I only have been playing for a few months I'm still a relative newbie,
but what I believe classifies me as no longer a newbie is that I'm learning
and have learned.  The people that I refer to in my own mind as newbies are
those that HAVE been playing for awhile and still don't really know a lot of
the fundamentals.  The big one recently for me has been /assist.  This is a
very simple thing to learn, and even more simple to program into a hotkey.
And yet last night I was grouping with a lvl 18 pally that didn't know how
to do this.  I'd go pull, come running back, even with an 'incoming soandso'
and start fighting.  Suddenly I'd look up and see "dumbass slashes
someothermob".  This happening once is cool.  I tell him how to use assist
and think, well maybe in the next couple of fights he'll figure it out and
we'll do better.  But nooooooo 6 fights later he is still attacking
something different than I was attacking.  Mind you, this is in Paludal
caverns where assist really does matter with the number of mobs you are
fighting.  So I tell him to go pull and I will /assist him.  Thinking this
might solve the problem.  He pulls, turns around starts fighting, I give him
like two seconds so he has time to pick the mob he wants to fight (hoping
he'd go for the highest level one, but that is beside the point) and then
assist him, and jump into the fray.  Low and behold I look up and he's
smacking something different.  Why the heck would you suddenly change
targets mid-fight.  There is a very simple law of most RPG's that a wounded
enemy does just as much damage as a full health one, so there is no reason
to spread the damage around.  Kill something until it is dead, then move to
the next one, repeat.  (Now I would like to see a game that this wasn't true
with.  Think about it, the more damaged you are, the weaker you would be and
therefore the less amount of damage, but that is off topic.)

Anyway, point of all that rant.  The true newbie (just logged in for the
first time and having no real idea of what to do, even after reading the
instruction book) is seldom annoying.  I asked a lot of questions when I
started and got a lot of help.  The annoying nOObie is the one that has been
playing for awhile and due to begging, or powerleveling or something or
other, or maybe just the complete unwillingness to learn still has no real
clue what they are doing and as a result gets you killed in a group, or just
annoys the hell out of you while you are playing, begging for money, sow, or
whatever.

To all of you that have helped me out in the game (and in this newsgroup for
that matter) I thank you.  For those people out there (who I highly doubt
read this newsgroup, since that demonstrates a willingness to learn more
about the game) who refuse to learn simple mechanics and niceties in the
game, please find a one player game to play and stop bugging the rest of us,
and giving us genuine newbies a bad rap.
