Recently aqquired OOW.
Main char is 60 druid, and also have 57 warrior on second account.
I am only a casual player, usually Uk afternoons, and venril server can be 
queit sometimes.

Have been to Draniks Scar, and quite easily killed in the north west corner 
of the zone. Typical Druid?Warrior strategies, and made reasonable XP.

Not yet ventured anywhere else, but have seen many peeps in WoS, Proving 
Grounds, Bloodfields and Causeway.

So basic questions are along the following lines...

1. The instanced Zones? Only from Draniks? How to enter and how many minimum 
for grp. Assume after is similar to LDoN?

2. Is draniks a bit like POTranq, as in its a zone that is used to enter all 
the other OOW zones? And if so, do I need to be flagged or of a certain 
level?

3. On entering any such zones, will I be met with any nasty suprises, I 
still remember my first port into Wakening lands.

4. What are the exits like, though as a druid Iassume I could port out 
easily enough.

I know these questions sound like I need somone to "hold my hand" but as I 
said, Im only casual, learning all the time, and most times is hard to find 
required help in game. This newsgroup has been very helpful along my way.

I am aware that the game has evolved and that many many chars are very 
experienced, and are usually part of "uber" Guilds. Amenta, Tide WW, etc in 
fact some appeared to level from 65 to 70 quicker than I leveled through 
1 -20!! I'm also aware that as yet Im not "flagged" for all POP zones, and 
should possibly do more Planes but to be honest, the games population is now 
so "high leveled" and Uber, that not many small raids take place, especially 
on venril sathir, and places like PON and POV are sometimes empty, 
especially after OOW. But that said, I do occassionally manage to find a 
group in Planes.

But Im drifting of the point now, so please, any help, simple as neccassary 
concerning OOW Zones/Camp spots for me and my 2, plus other occassional 
friends would be really appreciated.

Thanks in anticipation.
