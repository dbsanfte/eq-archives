1. Love in all it's forms
2. God and his King James Bible written in 1611
3. United States of America with laws that are not all unconstitutional
4. Freedom of speech and thought

All of these things are illegal now or will be very soon, I'm waiting to be
forcibly extracted from my home in the middle of the night without a
warrant, beaten and arrested, have ridiculous lies about me published in the
newspaper then swiftly executed by beheading without a trial, preferably on
television, i'll even pretend to be scared to death and beg for mercy so
it'll be more entertaining. I guess i'm an entertainer at heart, lol.

Anyway, you know you want to do it, why don't you just do it now so I don't
have to wait around here any longer.

Oh yeah, it hasn't rained for 3 weeks either, I don't expect it ever to
again. I just wish I could create a plague that is more forceful and
punishing but I don't know how, guess I'll just ask God to bring down a new
plague that is more forceful and directly punishing and see what happens.

Dear God, please afflict these people with something a little more
devastating than a draught, or an earthquake or a winter storm, so they will
learn to fear you and won't have to go through the really bad 3.5 years
where fire is involved, I can't really tell you what to do, but they just
aren't getting the point I don't think.

In Jesus name,
Amen
