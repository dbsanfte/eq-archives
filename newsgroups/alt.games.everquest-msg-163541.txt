    Right now I'm flagged for PoV/PoS, PoI-Factory, CoD upper and lower
(Bertox), PoTorment, NightmareB. Other members of the guild are flagged for
HoH, Seventh Hammer, PoTactics (ooooh, I gotta get this flag!). Last night
we tried the Bertox ring for the first time, and it was an absolute BLAST!
My favourite ring event by far. Anything where I can make an AA yellow in a
two hour raid is fun. ;-) And there were some really neat drops - fast
two-handers (33 DEL) with DAM > DEL, a 90/90 FT II caster shoulder with nice
stats, and we didn't even get to Bertox!

    Well, it's not that simple. His point about not being able to get spells
is a valid one, even if he exaggerates the difficulty a bit. Casters don't
think of spells as loot, but rather as part of what they are. Until you have
your 65 spells, you don't feel like a level 65 caster. Verant doesn't agree
with that, sadly.
