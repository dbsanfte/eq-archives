What about people who use high levels to protect a lowbie
(invis etc.) while the high level kills a mob and lets the
lowbie loot it?

Also, it could get tricky deciding where to draw the line.
Are tradeskill ingredients nodrop or saleable?  Not that
there'd be as much selling (or at least, the prices wouldn't
be as high) since there wouldn't be much to buy except other
tradeskill stuff).  But then what happens when I combine
stuff to make new things?  Two spider silks for a swatch; is
the swatch nodrop?

It also means people would end up with a lot of useless junk,
unless they also made it possible to donate nodrop items for
tribute.  (Or at least the nodrop items that are droppable on
other servers.)
