I am sure it wasn't planned, but it wasn't safeguarded against either. If it
was a power problem thats what back ups are for. Not many systems go without
back up. What I really think is stupid is the lack of information provided
when something likes this happens. Would have loved to have seen a message
on the website or on eqcastersrealm saying "Yes we have a problem and yes we
are working on it and yes we will retrieve corpse etc, to correct things"
Instead we get lame stuff. Call me frustrated. The upgrade came out almost 2
weeks ago and its been full of headaches. They should do better beta testing
on new software, its not a novel concept - its a common practice. This
brownout or whatever the heck it was just seemed to be the icing on the
cake.
