My original comment was thus:

"Let me see, now how
much of an influence is 18 odd years of bringing up a kid from an age where
they don't even know if it is wrong or right to smear shit over their faces
and play with their pecker all day? Now for the kicker - how much are
genetics involved in the chances of developing mental illness?"

I have never said once it is the parents fault soley because of genetics.
The other thing I have consisitently paired it with is enviroment which
during the upbringing (we are dealing with a teenager in the example) years
is the responsibility of the parents also.

The thread just took a detour since your honed in solely on the genetics
issue, ignoring everything else, and made the immortal comment:

"suggesting its the parents fault that the kid has bad genetics is far far
worse".

I thought it was amusing in a ridiculous way that you have stated, and
continue to state, that a person has bad genetics - but this is not
attributed to parents. I am intrigued who you think is responsible for a
persons genetics if not the parents? The stork who delivered the baby? The
farmer in the cabbage patch?
