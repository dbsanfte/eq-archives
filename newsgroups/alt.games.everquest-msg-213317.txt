I have to admit I had to chuckle when I read that. While I'm fully
agreeing with you.... what about that comment in parenthesis? Isn't
that exactly what you're saying is not being responsible for your own

else?

But regardless, I fully understand where you're comming wrong and
wholeheartedly agree.
