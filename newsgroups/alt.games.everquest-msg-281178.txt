Why not? Did you read his post?

> I have no idea what his

This, for example, could be remedied by reading his post:

"Yesterday I go to login and I get the error message:

Error downloading Pather Files
Error:Could not download file.
Please rerun Everquest.exe to try again."

> but he seemed pretty sure it was a video card problem  and

If you went to your mechanic and said "My brakes don't work, i put in an 
aftermarket stereo, I think its the problem" and the mechanic said "We 
don't support aftermakret stereos, goodbye." 

Would you think that was a reasonable response? Would that be a mechanic 
you went back to?

The tech should have performed his own diagnosis of the PROBLEM based on 
the symptoms and/or error messages not what the OP said he thought the 
problem was. I can tell you from experience that sometimes the customer 
does have a good handle on what the problem is, but far more often than 
not, the customers theory on why his system isn't working is utterly and 
completely misguided.

Of course at SOE they are rewarded for fast turnaround not effective 
support. If he can close another ticket by writing down "unsupported gfx 
card" instead of actually troubleshooting the problem, he makes his boss 
glow with pride and happiness.

> I don't see where he said the TS guy said it was a video card problem.

"I then contacted SOE online tech chat and he told me that my card is 
not supported."

Sure, you *could* theorize that the first, and only thing he said was 
"EQ doesn't work, I have Radeon blah blah blah that worked for 5 
months..." but we have no reason to beleive that is the case.

I beleive this is what happened:

TS How can I help you?
OP I get an error runing the patcher. "Error downloading pather 
files" ...
TS Ok... lets see what we can do. OK...What video card do you have?
OP radeon blah blah.
TS that's not on our supported list
OP its new and its worked for 5 months
TS we don't support it and can't help you. try the latest drivers. 
TS goodbye.

OP Hey A.G.E... I have a radeon blah blah blah and I'm getting this 
error, and i called tech support and they said my video card wasn't 
supported...
