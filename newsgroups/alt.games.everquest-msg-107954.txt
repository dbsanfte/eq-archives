Have you considered taking your time, playing to enjoy rather than level,
doing some quests, helping out newbies and guildies, exploring zones that do
not necessarily give the best experience but which you haven't been in
before, developing trade skills, exploring the world etc? How about some
role-playing?

I just ask.....on account of the fact that so many people seem to miss out
on what the game is all about - its just a game, to be enjoyed, its not a
race or competition. Moreover, any character's advancement will depend far
more on how he/she is played and the level of any twinking than on whether
he/she gets a 5% exp bonus etc.

I'm also surprised that anyone who's taken 2 characters from scratch to 50
(as opposed to ebaying them) should even need to ask :).
