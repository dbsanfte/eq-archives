SCS = Single Character Servers.

Due to the unique structure of the game (particularly (1) the fact that
every character is guaranteed a certain amount of in-game real-estate,
making it necessary to be able to figure pretty exactly how many characters
will be active on any given server, and (2) the mechanics designed to
strongly encourage helping out lower level players, nearly all of which
could be circumvented by simply creating a second character, "helping" that
character, then deleting him/her), the devs decided that each account can
have only 1 character per server.  You can, however, have multiple
characters, each on a different server.

I suppose this is a matter of opinion.  My point of view is that since I
started playing EQ, I've seen a number of things I did not like (granted,
I've also seen many things I *do* like).  Until recently I still intended to
keep playing EQ because it's still the best there is.  But when I checked
out the SWG site I found, to my amazement, that for every single issue I've
seen with EQ, they have a solution that looks very good in the works for
SWG.  You have to keep in mind that these are the EQ developers who now have
4 years of experience and are creating an entirely new game using everything
they've learned from the good and bad of EQ.

> And if you believe everything you read, I've got a deal for you.....

I don't believe everything I read.  I don't recall ever making an absolute
statement that everything people are saying about SWG is going to turn out
to be true.  I'm simply taking exception to the following statement of
yours:

"SWG isn't going to be as cool as everyone
thinks."

Now, if you'd said "I don't think SWG will be as cool as everyone thinks"
then I'd say you're entitled to your opinion.  But I think it's a bit
arrogant to say, nope, that game sucks, period, before it's even been
released and before *anyone* knows anything about it besides what's been
said on the SOE website.
