Yep. And I wish the color was different. The stats rock, but the color? Bleh.
Should have been Navy Blue or Black. My Human Necro has a set of Flayed Skin, a
Harvester and a Staff of Writhing. Someone once told me I look like a gay Monk!

(I'd love to trade the Flayed Skin Cap for a different Necro-wearable
headpiece)

I'm on the Rathe Server, and I've NEVER seen an Erudite wearing Flayed Skin;
only humans.
