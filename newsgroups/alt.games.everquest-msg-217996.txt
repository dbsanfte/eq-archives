You're right. "Dumbing down" really isn't the right term. It is more a 
case of EQ getting trivialized over time. It is *much* easier to level a 
character up now than ever before, thanks solely to the frequent changes 
to fundamental aspects of the game.

Fun doesn't have to mean easy. The process of developing a character in 
EQ shouldn't be trivialized because a vocal segment of players can't 
find a way to have fun without it being made easy for them.

Of course I recognize full well the fact that this is just my 2cp worth 
and others may well not share my views on what makes a game worth 
playing. Simply put, I just miss the way EQ used to feel.
