Never underestimate the importance of the support flunky.

Chanters don't get snare.  It's very helpful to have someone who can stun 
the pet when it breaks.  We will need at least one rez during the trial.

And I've definitely noticed the mobs die faster with both my pet and 
melees beating on them, rather than just one or the other.

And at the very least, I need 4 other non-cleric bodies to get in the pet 
and target mob's ways when charm breaks...
