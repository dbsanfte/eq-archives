They have that for gm's/guides... at least a /who zone command... but they
say the main world server can't handle the load that would result from the
ability to do a /who zone from another zone.

Raid shows class/level in the raid window
Group does NOT. Fortunately at my level it's usually easy to guess, at least
close enough for my buffing job (group clarity, and if it looks like it is a
melee, haste it.)
I think the easy way to implement this would be to go ahead and drop the
group into the group 1 area of the raid window when you form the group, to
let people see who's who, or something.

now onto the other part of my discussion, my ideal /who command.

/who (all/zone) (class) (level range) (group/raid, only for the one you are
in, shows class/level regardless of anon) (race) (name) (guildname, by full
name, or GUILD for your own guild) (officer, for an officer in the guild you
are looking at) (guildleader, same thing) (LFG) (groupleader, to see who is
leading groups in the area you are interested in) (raidleader, same thing)
(NOTTRADER, for bazaar) (NOTSOLO, for people who have not set the 'solo'
tag, see below) (healer) (melee) (nuker)
revamp the /anon command.
/a (level) (class) (race) (guildtag, hides your guildtag, can still be found
by cluefull people with /guildstatus) (guildlist, for when you feel the need
to not show up on /who all GUILD)
/roleplay should simply turn your name purple for 'I wanna roleplay'
I want to see the following added:
/solo on/off, for people who want to solo and not be bothered for groups.
/busy for people who may not be afk, but are busy doing tradeskilling,
fishing, quest turn in's, practicing spell skills, cybering, whatever. I
always seem to get invites to seb when I sit down to do jewelcrafting...
hmmm maybe I'll start doing that more often :)
/lfg on should turn off anon class/level.. I hate /lfg anon/roleplay
people... means I actually have to talk to them, and if it's, for example,
another 53rd druid and I need a tank, they get bitchy.
