Just wanted to say hey and hope everyone had a happy holiday.  It's been a
great one for me.

Decided to take the night off yesterday and watch a movie.  Was sitting on
the couch and phone rang, so I went to answer and looked over at one of my
comps that had my bazaar mule up.  I got a tell from a friend asking if I
ever got VSR yet.  I said no, and he said that they killed him at 21:30 the
night before.  Hmmm...should I log in?  Well, it's 21:38, so I told friend
on the phone that VSR died the night before...told her to go check him and
give me a call if he shows up.  Back to movie.

About fifteen minutes later, phone rings.  I answer, and she says "get here
NOW".  Well, I log in and hoof it to KC.  Get summoned to VSR room and we
kill the barstard.  I've been after him off and on since July, and
FINALLY...got the stone!!!

YAY!  Was a good night for me!  Anyway, just wanted to share...that made my
weekend.

Cheers!
