You'll want to check with the evil guy at every level to get the quests from
him or you may miss out as I did on one character not sure if it was a
glitch or not but I got task 1-4 missed 5 even though I went to him at the
appropriate lvl and am onto lvl 6 now.
Just for the record I did the same thing as you, rolled up on a new server
and I'm having a blast.  Now some of the tasks are a pain in the butt, but
the armor is decent.  I have wrists (if you don't mind the dark elf faction
hit you can do the good quest you have to kill the crushbone orc
centurions), feet, hands, and helm.  If the helm is any indication the rest
of the armor is gonna be great.
