Most of my time in PC was on Venril Sathir when it was all new - 60-80
players in PC. Quite painful. I started the monk later on, and by then
it was more like 20-30 players, still occasional grouping
opportunities at fiends or bugs, though less so with bugs because
they're so low level. I mostly just soloed with her, though, because I
didn't feel like doing pick up groups at the time.

I've never pick-up-grouped in Paludal on any other server, but on The
Tribunal, there were about 20-30 players there last time I visited
(and that was at low population time, before most Americans get on),
so it might be possible to get a non-bandit pick up group.
