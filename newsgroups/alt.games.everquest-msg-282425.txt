The thing you effectivly advocate is to shut down all the zones that
aren't used. After all that costs cpu power and bandwith(when somebody
gets there). Content is only interesting until it is exhausted.
Sometimes not even then. Just have a look at the DoN missions and ask
around what missions everyone has done. Creator...sure. And a couple
more too just to confirm that nothing beats the Crystals/mission ratio! :(

That aside EQ is old. Revamping zones is one way to make it attractive
to even new players. Because I don't buy the "don't care about looks"
crap. If you don't find the game attractive you won't spend time on it.
Unless you already have been convinced that this game offers you
something you look for.

So yes I am all for a zone revamp if the zones try to retain their
original feeling. That definitely does not apply to nektulus but how
about lavastorm?

Until DoN I doubt this zone has been frequented heavily. And freeport
doesn't come empty. There is a whole set of quests in this town.
Complete with backing lore. And that is content I like in a mmorpg.
Again if you just cut all that isn't current content EQ would be an
extremely poor game imho. Giving me the opportunity to do something else
is a thing I'm grateful for. Even if this means running around a zone
just for the experience.

And I believe that this revamp should start with the less used zones.
For the single reason that this could motivate a few people to actually
go out of their way to experience and talk about other than current zones.
