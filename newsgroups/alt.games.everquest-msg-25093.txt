That's is because VI wants to FORCE people to group. You aren't supposed to
solo, yet some of the people like the one you mentioned its just way to
unrealistic. There is a point where even in fantasy something can become to
much.

I do agree at lower levels you stand against things = to your power. Yet as
you "level" you most seek friends to destory the things that con blue to
you. Its just to encourage wait REQUIRE that people group...
