True.

But consider 1984 -- in that case: despite the fact that I actively 
despised most of the characters in it, and disliked practically 
everything about it by the time it was over. I still walked away from it 
with a profound sense of the theme and the warning that was its subtext, 
and still appreciate it on that level.

ST simply doesn't have that level, B5 did. Regardless of which you 
enjoyed better.
