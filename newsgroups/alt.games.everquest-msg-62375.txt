I don't think so. I'm pretty sure I know the one you're talking about,
but he's triggered through a series of actions, and comes out and
announces to the zone something about "...another fool come to challenge
me and die.." or somesuch. He's also not invisible to the best of my
knowledge. The one being discussed here is the alleged "Pain and
Suffering". I've been with rangers that claim to have had him on track
as an NPC with no name, but we never bothered trying to drag him out of
the lava.
