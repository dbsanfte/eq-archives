Not at all, but you have to be weary on new members and let them know
what the current loot strat is at the time that they join. If they
don't want to group, that's fine.

It may seem obvious to you.. and if you want him to follow your loot
system.. explain it at the time of his joining. With pickup in Sol Ro
I can count on one hand the number of times NBG ever came up or was
much less used. In guild... sure. But most of the people that you can
get to come to Sol Ro in pickup come for the loot, they can certainly
get better xp in earth. And for most the odds that their one or two
particular items will drop is insanely remote. So most people i've met
have no problem with the following.

'All ornate gets rolled on. If you win a piece of ornate, you can roll
on another, but if you win it you must give up the piece you have.
That way nobody has two pieces until everyone has at least one.'

The last part of it is in case someone won Silk Turban(craptastic),
and Plate Greaves(omfg) dropped... they had a chance to win the
greaves while tossing the Silk Turban back.

Uh.. ya. If you want to bring someone in to your group its your
responsibility to get them set on the loot strat.

Pretty much :>.

And now you admit there was a good chance you didn't need them anyways
and would just sell. This is exactly the reason groups don't go NBG in
Sol Ro.
