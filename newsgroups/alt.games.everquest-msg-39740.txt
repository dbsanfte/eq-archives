You're pretty much making my point for me. Hughes said the item would
not be available to buy, and here you've outlined yet another way by
which it *will* be available. Thanks.

I'd counter that it's not much of a reward if it's an appropriate item
for a character many levels lower than the casual player. Unless, of
course, the casual player is only there to farm the item.

Ok, so you and I both disagree with this point that Hughes made.

As far as I've seen, a given TCC zone has nothing to do with changing
what people do in other zones. Why do you ask?
