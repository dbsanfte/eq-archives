The reason no drop equipment exsists at all is to keep the poor people poor.
If a large majority of the equipment was not no drop then quickly the lower
level people would have access to really nice equipment at a very small
price . The sole function of no drop is to keep those that acquire equipment
from passing it on.

This harms the overall economy though . The lower level plebians have no
access to the good stuff , while the upper level nobles have no way to
profit from their access to extra equipment . Both are harmed and the
overall economy and growth of that economy is thus much less.

Note the upper level nobles did indeed work for everything they get and are
not actively trying to keep the poorer people poor. I wonder if our fine
socialists here can begin to understand trickle down economics if it is
reduced to such a simple model that everquest does.
