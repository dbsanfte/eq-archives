Acutally, they'd have to be in order to play at that level. Think
about it.

How many real adults, contributing to society with a job and/or
children, that you know of could even meet the requirements listed to
join FOH or Afterlife? I know of zero.
This means that by definition they'd have to be taken care of by their
parents and are very likely to be immature. 

You might be in a regular guild of people with full time jobs and
lives outside of the game, who all play sometimes at night or
something, but you won't be playing at anywhere near that level.
