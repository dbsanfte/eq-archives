So don't exercise your free will and choose to believe

Sure, but those courses depend upon the observed object
lessons of those around them.   Orbital patterns are "set
in stone," right?   They still depend on the gravitational
pull of other objects or, even more, the absence of
another object at the same time and place.  Sometimes
it's necessary to have another object, even if you're not
interested it in on its own merits.

To you, not to others.

You presumably play a game over which you have zero
control, although you have the illusion of control.  At some
point, "God" will pull the plug.   All your effort, all your
accomplishments, will be as dust in the wind.   Why play
at all?

Assuming a creator, to know why you exist you'd have to
understand God's motives.  IMO, that's a bit much to ask.
Most of us have enough trouble understanding our own
motives all the time.
