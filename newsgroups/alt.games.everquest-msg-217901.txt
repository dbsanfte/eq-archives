Phinigel has two kinds of guards.
Swirlspine Seahorses are not immune to magic, not particularly tough, and
not able to see invisible.  They spawn when Phinney spawns.
Swirlspine Guardians are nearly immune to magic, CH, are a mild pain in the
butt, drop a mildly nifty haste belt as a rare drop, and can see invis.
They despawn about twenty minutes after Phinney dies, if they have not been
cleared before you kill Phinney.

Note:  The information in the following paragraph has been tested over two
weeks of daily Phinney kills.  I know it wasn't always this way, but this is
how it's working now:
     When Phinny first spawns, he only has Swirlspine Seahorses up.
Swirlspine Guardians spawn WHEN YOU KILL SWIRLSPINE SEAHORSES.  So, if you
lull the Seahorses and pull Phinney past them, you don't have to mess with
Guardians.  Simplicity itself.

Oh, and btw - Rapture is not unresistable; I had quite a mess once in
Chardok when it was resisted right outside the king room.  :)  And the
recast time on it stinks.
