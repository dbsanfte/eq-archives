I'm not sure if something like this already exists (the information is out
there in a less collected fashion), but in case not, I thought I'd share
this if folks wanted to bookmark it or some such.  I had some notes I'd
kept on the details of the 5 different drogan free slave quests (the ones
that give nice FT2 and Veng2 items), and I wrote up a guide.  It doesn't
talk about the quest to actually free the slaves, but focuses on what you
do once they are freed.

If anyone has any suggestions of additional information I could
include...such as perhaps a map giving the location of named mobs and
which areas have the non-named mobs you need...hmm, ok, yes, better add
that. But in addition to that, let me know what else this guide could
use. :) It's my first time trying to give back to the EQ spoiler community
and I want to do it right.
