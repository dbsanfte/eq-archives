Class add a lot of utility with Twitch, and Corpse summons.

*mock* No... I have no idea what Protection of the nine is... Ive only
played a druid for 65 levels and 60+ AA's not knowing anything about a
druid....

WTF are you talking about ? Biased ? In what way ? I have nothing against
druids, like I said Ive played one a LONG time, and Still enjoy it, but
plainly put there isnt anything that a druid brings to a high level raid
that isnt brought by some other class that can do it even better. Sure Pot9
+ Symbol is a couple of hundred HP More, but it also takes 3 slots vs 1 for
Virtue ( 1 slot for Pot9, 1 for Kazzaad, and one for the cleric AC Buff,
dont recall the name )  to have the same effect, a poor trade off if you ask
me.
