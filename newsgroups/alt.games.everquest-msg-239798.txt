Always the 'gun to head' argument. Give it a rest. 

By not making it explicit that you are using an unessary tool to
access a resource that is both free and readily available is at best
incomplete information, and at worst, especially  when motivated by a
desire to increase audiences for advertising revenue is dishonest and
deceptive on par with the twits that that repackage and redistribute
freeware applications for money and don't tell you that you can
download it elsewhere for free.

You are aware that when a company goes to the point of blocking
"access to newsgroups, even through programs like Outlook Express", it
is trying to enforce the pretty self evident policy that they do not
wish their computing resources to be used for that purpose.

It is a clear  misuse of what access they did grant you, if you use it
to find 'gateways' and other alternative ways of accessing resources
they went out of their way to block.

Actually most  usenet users tend to take a dim view of web forums, and
a very dim view when web forums are bridged onto usenet.

To each their own.
