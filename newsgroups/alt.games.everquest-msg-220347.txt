I actually played again this weekend - I dont so much any more - duoing
in Cazic thule with a druid for healer. Amazingly enough, even
with level 57 heals I still melee'd through enrage. They didnt hit hard
at all and my damage shield cut em up fast - frequently, they hit for
less than the damage shield did to them and I was more concerned about
getting through the kills fast enough to keep up with the pops than
anything else ;)

It was fun though ;)
