Take a look at

http://www.alcaudon.com/everquest/hanrahan_horse_large.jpg

and replace the CGS with a pulsating Crystal Chitin Shield, and that's me

were in a position to get Golden Efreeti Gaunts to match the GEBs. =/

If you look at the neck area, that hasn't changed, so I have the feeling 
/dopropertinting is still broken, at least with my GeForce 3. Bah.
