You're still DD kiting, which is never good efficiency compared to a
group in a decent spot.

Some spots don't seem so harmonyable. Oh sure the spell affects them
but then you pull and a second comes anyways. I think, in some spots,
they are simply linked and you get two no matter what.

Then there's the necro shadowmen. Their spells hit you just as hard as
yours hit them. They aren't much fun. Add a cleric shadowman and you
got trouble. A cleric shadowman can run an untwinked druid at the
proper levels dry and still be healing themselves as you beat a hasty
retreat (did we mention that all but one spot of shadowmen are
sowed?).

No, shadowmen are pretty low on the list of good mobs to hunt at that
level.
