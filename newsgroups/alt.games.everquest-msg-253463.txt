I think the biggest problem is that people do a lot more city driving
now, and most people don't use their manual trannys in an efficient
manner. I know my dad really lays on the tranny and engine to jump off
the starting lines (aka. traffic signals) and just about everyone else
I see too. For freeway driving the manual is more efficient, but with
everyone racing down the road at the highest speed they can get away
with, fuel effificncy seems to be secondary. Every vehicle would be a
lot more fuel efficient, if people would just slow down and not take
off like a bat out of hell at each and every stop light.

As for the V8 issue, people who want larger trucks generally want
larger engines. Also on my truck (a Dodge Ram 1500) I had the option
of going with a V6, but I was informed that with the added weight of
the vehicle the V6 didn't get that much better gas milage than the V8,
and had to work harder, shortening it's life. I didn't actually see
the gas milage stickers on the V6, so they may have been blowing smoke
up my ass. (My truck gets horrid gas milage, and every day I wish I
had a more efficient vehicle, but that was the only one out that year
that I could sit in without rubbing my head on the roof.)
