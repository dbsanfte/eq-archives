So if the mob casts a damage shield on itself, you can't change
weapons? If we didn't have a weapon ready, we have to hand-to-hand or
cast spells instead of pulling out a weapon? On the hate list for
snaring a mob and ran two hundred yards from it, but I can't take off
a cloak or ready a bow? Main tank is engaged with the mob and I am 50
feet away but I still can't change wands because I'm on a hate list?
