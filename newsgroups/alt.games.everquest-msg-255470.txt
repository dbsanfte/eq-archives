Sadly, it's starting to look more and more apparent that they won't wake up,
or that they choose not to becasue they have an out.  With EQ2 taking aim at
this type of player, I doubt very seriously that they'll do anything other
than point at the other door down the hall and say "Go there instead".

That's okay by me, though.  If I can roleplay a ranger that way in EQ2, I'll
just bail out and restart.  It will always be a concern, though, that
history will repeat itself over there ... it's two rooms in the same
building, after all.

I suppose it would be different if this type of playing wasn't viable from
the start ... then one's not left with the 'bait and switch' impression.
It's pretty lousy, IMO, that you can get so far in to a character before
having to change your ways.
