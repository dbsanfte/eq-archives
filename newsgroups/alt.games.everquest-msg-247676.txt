Well, I knew he was angry at me by the asked me what I was doing after he
made the effort to run up to me and get right in my face (my first levitate
spell!).
Unfortunately this was after I had engaged the mob and it was down to
40-ish% so there wasn't much I could do about it then.
Things could have gone way nasty.

I left the zone as I had achieved what I wanted to do and it wasn't worth
getting aggro over.
