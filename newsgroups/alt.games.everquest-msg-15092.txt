25 is not a hell level.  If you've only soloed so far you should definitely
start grouping,  personally I hate soloing because it's so boring.  It's
also a good idea to decide on which character you really want to play, if
you want to level relatively fast, because trying to take 2+ characters
through the 20s at the same time will be really bad, but if you don't care
about leveling, it doesn't really matter.  Basically it just takes a lot of
time.  One of the favorite hunting zones for 20s characters is Lake of Ill
Omen in Kunark, personally I haven't hunted there but it's pretty popular,
though it got stealth nerfed like 1 or 2 months back (ZEM was changed from
100 to 75).
