Moot point?  The official implementation of windows EQ fucking blows!

Some "hacker" school kid wrote a better system then VI's high paid team of
programmers.. thats embarassing.

Why didn't they just buy EQW and take the MS approach...

As it stands, I expect to crash when alt+entering, alt+tab makes the screen
do weird stuff.. its just not cool.
Im glad they added the feature.. but why break EQW?  At least EQW worked,
god damn them.

Maybe the kid can tell them how to fix the "running multiple copies"
problem...
