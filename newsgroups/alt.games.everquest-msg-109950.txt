I have not asserted that "My Way is the Only Way".  I do believe that
there is a universal concept that can be referred to as "good", and
that there is another that can be referred to as "evil".  I take my
inability to articulate these concepts clearly as an indication that
my conscious understanding of them is incomplete, not as an indication
that they are either inexpressible or non-existant.

And yet you assert the "universal truth" that there is no absolute
standard that can be referred to by the words "good" and "evil".

The observable fact that the words "good" and "evil" (and those words
in other languages that are translated into english as "good" and
"evil") are used with different meanings does not have any bearing on
the existence or non-existence of universal concepts that can be
refered to using the words.
Consider:  When you attempt to get someone's attention and the reply
"just a second", "one sec", etc. you well know that this person is
speaking of a probably brief but variable interval of time that is
not identical to the well defined interval used in science, industry,
law, & etc.  And so while "a second" can refer to a subjective interval
of time, that fact alone does not mean that there is not a universal
concept that can be and is referred to by the term "second", nor does
it cause time to vanish in a puff of bad logic.  Nor does the fact that
I cannot tell you how many oscillations of a cesium atom at what
absolute temperature and gravity potential (or whatever the hell the
"official" definition of a "second" as a unit of time is) mean that
this specific interval of time does not exist.

No one in my experience has ever demonstrated the truth of any article
of faith, yourself included (see below).

Cleverness is no more a virtue than tallness or shortness.

And this differs from any other statement of belief in a universal
truth how?
