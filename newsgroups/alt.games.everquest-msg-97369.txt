I never really liked Monty Haul style sessions when I played
D&D, but, like it or not, EQ is about more and better stuff
dropped all the time.  My first character was a bard, named
Tindayen on Povar.  I started him the day after release, and
played him to 24 or 25 (can't quite remember) in 22 days 
played.  I stopped because I had to switch ISP's and lost the
ability to keep 3 songs up.  Ironic, because I discovered
weaving on my own prior learning about the mailing list EQbards.
The point - At 25 I had mostly banded, a couple of pieces of 
bronze, a dwarven axe (can't remember the stats, but non-magic,
a 2:7 ish dam/del ratio) and a dragoon dirk.  I was not ill
equipped back then.  Now, a new player, 0 twinkage, can be
outfitted in vastly superior gear by 15 simply by virtue of
mudflation.  I believe (an opinion only) that mudflation has
had a vastly greater impact on the difficulty of 1-30 than the
changes currently being proposed.  I don't forsee that changing
either.  More and better gear will enter a world, forcing the
always increasing stores of previously great gear down in price
to the point that a true lowbie has no problem affording it.

Those of you who worry about the "slippery slope" should have
started worrying more than 3 years ago, during beta when casters
got the ability to manipulate inventory and talk while medding.
(previously, you're character was medding, you couldn't do anything
else).

No CR before level 10 is a bit more of a change.  But it represents
only a quantitative change from previous VI practice, that is easing
a new player into the penalties of death.  I refer to the newbie
starter kit of food/water and a weapon on respawn up to 3, and no
xp loss up to 6.

The rezz extension and xp bonuses in dungeons are an obvious attempt
to get people out of the Oasis/LoIO/OT/DL rut.  They have done a great
deal that wasn't in the original vision to encourage peope to go to
dungeons more, including adding melee bindpoints.  The problem with 
Brad and his vision wasn't that it was bad, but that no plan survives
contact with reality, and he was too inflexible to adjust to the 
changing demographic of EQ.  And the reality of nearly half a million 
people playing EQ is that many of them don't want to risk death in a 
dungeon that is a 30min to 1 hour CR from the nearest bind point.  (The 
reason old paw was so under-utilized)  You're a non-binder, but you possess
an advantage (as did I when I grouped in Paw at 14-16) that other non-
binders do not - you can run *VERY* fast on your way from your bind 
point on a CR.  Now, imagine you're a 55 troll warrior.  Prior to the
added bind points, the nearest bind to seb was OT (if I'm not mistaken).
Now, you're bound in OT, there is no such thing as rez, and not enough
bonus XP in a dungeon to get you to go there - what are the chances you
are going to want to group in Seb?

(Sorry, I wasn't clear, we're taking Rez out of the game, because
it doesn't exist for the <30's we're trying to get to go to dungeons.
To appreciate their reluctance we have to assume that the Warrior
above will not be rezzed back to his party.)

With the exception of the level 10/CR thing, I think each of these
changes has the potential to increase the enjoyability of the game
for low level players.  In addition, I think encouraging them to go
to dungeons more and earlier, and being able to see during fights
(for casters) will help them learn the skills needed in the post 50
world.

Of course, I've thought for a very long time that EQ is careening
down the slippery slope of mudflation at an every increasing rate,
but that is another issue entirely.
