What Sword is doing here is showing that hypocrisy comes in all shapes and
sizes.  What he can't believe is that people are actually so bent out of
shape on a video game newsgroup, that they're willing to take the time to
call someone's ISP and have their accounts cancelled because they're too
thin-skinned to handle words being thrown.  Bizbee here, for example, can
dish it out, but is completely unable to take it.  Should he have his
internet service cancelled?  If being an idiot were a TOC violation, I'd
have to say he wouldn't be able to obtain services anywhere.
