Well it boils down to personal preference. EQ Atlas gave it a pretty
big thumbs up - and while factually correct - I do not agree with the
review. Ive only tried the goggles with EQ - and it does NOT add to
the experience, only detracts from it.

Afer the first oooo and ahhhhs.. I took them off, put them in a box,
and havent touched them since. Since EQ's interface is unreadable with
the 3d glasses, this renders the glasses useless, only good for
novelty. If this can be corrected, then it *might* be somewhat
worthwhile. I havent tried them in about 3 or 4 months, has there been
any improvement recently?
