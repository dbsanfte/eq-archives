Last discussion I saw on this topic at necro.eqclasses.com had most of
the older necros logging in to say that by then, unless you're giving
the pet some rediculously expensive weapon, they only do it "for looks".
The nerf was that the proccing was cut back to a level you'd more likely
see for a PC than an NPC. The raw damage, of course, will still be
whichever is larger of the weapon's damage, or the pet's bare fisted
(bare boned?) damage. The delay, likewise, will be the faster of the
two. I suppose a hammer of flattening or a tree flayer might still be an
awesome weapon for the pet. I'm looking forward to moving over to Kunark
in a few levels to experiement with that myself. he he.
