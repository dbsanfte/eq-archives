Among the holidays in the US, this is the one with the least overt
Religious overtones, family significance (trick or treating with the
youngsters excluded) and such.  Thus, it seems to be (at least around
this way) one of the prime holidays for setting up adult type parties.
Kind of a bear when it falls on a weeknight, though.

The really fun part is inviting your more geeky friends that you don't
mind abusing a bit to your "costume party", and forgetting to tell the
other guests that they should dress up.
