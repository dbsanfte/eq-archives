Youth of today? Well I'm actually getting up there in age much faster than
I'd like to admit although I'm not 'old' by any stretch.  To be quite
honest, I'm amazed that I've never heard of these books before the movie
either (now that I see just what  following they have)

Re: Sword, I suppose -  I understand that these books were written quite
sometime ago before all the dnd stuff which most people now consider
guidelines for wizards etc.

LOL - I really had to laugh on this one.  You see, I've never read the bible
either, I guess every year I just have an atheist Christmas :)  While I
can't see myself reading the bible, perhaps over the winter I will read the
first book.

Cheers!
