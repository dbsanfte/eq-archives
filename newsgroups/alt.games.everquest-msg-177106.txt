And while they're at it, double, not quadruple the mana pool and
increase the mana regen rate 10-fold.

Ok, I'm just funnin' ya. However, I do see the merit of limiting the
number of spells available for use. With regard to RP aspects, casters
expend mental energy readying and keeping ready whatever spells they
intend to have at their disposal at any given time. Therefore, this
number cannot be too great.

Secondly, and more importantly I think, a limit on the number of
spells at your disposal forces the employment of planning and tact.
You have to have some sort of idea what you need to plan for in many
cases. Anyone and their brother can root and nuke an Orc Centurion,
but the tougher the mobs get, the more effort should be required to
manage them.

I play casters and a bard. Whereas boosting the number of gems to
maybe 10 probably wouldn't be such a bad thing, I think that more than
that would detract from the game.
