And alchemy.  You know there are some physicists who still insist you can
make one element from another?  They call it "fission," but we aren't
fooled, are we?

It's always amazed me how people who fancy themselves to be scientific are
so willing to dismiss the possiblity of things that they have no proof,
either way, of.  Just because our rigid notions of what is science, and what
isn't hasn't seen fit to probe such questions as the soul (or "bio-kenetic
energy"), doesn't mean it doesn't exist, only that our modern society is too
narrow-minded to study it.  There are more things in heaven and earth, than
are dealt with in the sciences of man (with appologies to the Bard).

Well, I wasn't here 10,000 years ago, so I can't say for sure.  Still, it's
entirely possible.  Carbon dating is not as exact as the "experts" would
like you  to think... not by a wide margin.  I tend to believe it's a bit
older than that, but not as old as some try to say it is.

Absolutely amazing how much the human race assumes it knows.

Evidently, some people do actually win that money.
