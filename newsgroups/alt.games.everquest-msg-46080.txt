Euh, +int gear is about it. Resists might be useful, but not in the lower
levels. You could get your wiz a few Crystalline Nets for snaring mobs so
you have more time to try to root before nuking, but for the rest it's
mostly a problem of getting into groups. Try to get a few friends to twink
their alts and have you tag along for the ride.
