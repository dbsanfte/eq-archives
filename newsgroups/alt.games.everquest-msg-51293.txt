Don't feel to bad, I have an Iskar Sk and trade between a Darkenwood staff and polished brass shield
and a fine steel great staff. On crush/bash i average about 10 with the darkenwood staff and 6 with
the shield. my whopin' stick (the great staff) only averages about 12-15 damage. my 2h blunt is only
about 8 or 9 while my 1h blunt is 75 or so.....
I have found that the bash works best when i'm not really needing to cast a lot and have a pet as
cannon fodder.
