We don't get the fact that the 'proddies' go to look at something that they
have every right to look at?

We don't get the fact that as a 'test tubie' they should know that if
something exciting - Like new GUI... go figure - is announced, everyone and
their brother is gonna wanna take a look?

What we don't get is why this would surprise some one. It strikes me as
stupid that someone could be surprised by that. and since they know it's
gonna happen, maybe they should stop whining and deal with it.

just my 2c.
