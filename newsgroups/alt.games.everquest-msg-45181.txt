Any open area will do and your best bet is to partner with a druid or necro
mancer. Then use fear kiting method

1. Druid casts snare as you cast Tashan (tashan hits first so snare holds
easier)
2) mob comes hit you, step back as pet flies in
3) cast fear
4) nuke, dot, /poke mob, whatever ya wanna do, refear as neccessary
5) repeat

You can mez adds etc.

But.... you should only be doing this sort of thing occasionally for an exp
rush. You should group, group, group. Not only do you learn the tricks of
the trade (and there are more to learn then any other class) but the people
of your level also learn how to work with a chanter. Nothing more annoying
than having idiots at lvl 50+ still breaking mezzed mobs 'cos they have
never really learned.
