Blah, blah, blah... :)  We have all become frustrated with something
and come here merely to rant about it. It is good therapy until people
start to look for petty ways to convince you that your opinions are
invalid.

Of course I will continue to enjoy the rest of the game quite a lot.
Of course I will still run into the occasional frustration which
drives me to a.g.e. Of course then, it stands to reason, the
know-it-alls and elitists - present company excluded - will bash me
for it.

Thought it would make me feel better to rant about it a little. Some
folks just can't even let you do that.

A.g.e called - she wants her sense of community back
