The quest poster said from Qeynos to Freeport.  Qeynos Hills-West Karana-
North Karana-East Karana (all lovingly populated with violent nasties 
like hill giants, werewolves, gorge wolves (or something of the sort), 
lions, griffins (sp?)... although a friend kindly showed me that running 
along the waterline was fairly safe as long as you watched for raiders) - 
then you have a choice - King Xorb's Something, where you have minotaurs 
and muddites wandering free, able to stun and kick your ass in a very 
short time - Runnyeye which has SEVERAL fairly strong gobs even on the 
first floor which enjoy stunning you and then again creaming you (and 
there are lots around so they'll be happy to join in) - Misty Thicket - 
Rivervale - Kithicor Wood (running along the edge - in the DAY only - is 
again safe as safe can be - West Commons - East Commons - Freeport - then 
back.  OR you can skip Xorb/Runnyeye/MistyThicket/Rivervale by running 
from East Karana through High Hold to Kithicor Wood - but several players 
I've talked to have said that High Hold is extremely dangerous and that 
the Runnyeye route was the easier way.  This was at level 11 or 12.

OTOH, I'd say the vengefuls are a fairly safe bet now.  Maybe not the one 
that cons red - a friend gave me a 'twink' in the form of a jade chodikai 
prod, I have no idea how good that is, so it's hard to tell how much that 
influenced my winning against the reds - but the yellows are pushovers.

(ack - there's a lot of ()s in that long paragraph. sorry.)
