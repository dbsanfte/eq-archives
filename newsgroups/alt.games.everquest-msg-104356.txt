Welll...you could *also* say that monks get FD and bards get to run
like a bat outta hell.  Shit happens.  Even discounting LD and raids.
You get feared, you get rooted, you get charmed, you get blinded, you
get summoned...you get the picture.  Some mega oober thing spawns
right on top of you and you're dead before you even know you've been
hit.  Dungeons are much easier places to die in; do you hunt in them
much?

That said, sure, some people die more than others.  To say my pally
friend is a bit directionally challenged is like saying the ocean is a
tad wet.  She can be counted on , sure as death and taxes, not only to
run the wrong way in a "whoa shit" situation, but to run in the
*precise* direction which will maximize injury to herself.  She's
elevated running the wrong way to an art form.  I keep telling her to
go the *opposite* of the direction she thinks she should go, but that
doesn't seem to work out either...

What was the question?  Oh, I remember.  I don't think I die that
often, I average perhaps a death for every 80 or 100 hours of play.
But that's a lot more than 10 over the life of my character.  And I
almost invariably know where the zone is and what's around me.
