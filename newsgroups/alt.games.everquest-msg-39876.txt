These are the reasons I gave for low levels not liking the code. I did so
because I was asked . These reasons are not supposed to be valid for you but
valid for the lower level characters that want to know why tcc hurts *them*
. I was trying to explain how it makes the game harder, or how it detracts
from the overall experience , and these reasons are to some point mutually
exclusive with other reasons.
