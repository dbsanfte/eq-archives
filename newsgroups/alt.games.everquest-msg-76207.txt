Hiya!

While awaiting the ability to transfer Cory to the second account, I have
made a Barb Shaman.  One of the Halas Quests is to go collect 6 honey comb.

I sat for an hour auctioning a trade of 2 HQ Bear and 1 HQ wolf for a port
to Misty Thicket so that I might gather some honeycomb.  Nobody was
interested.

I got tired of that and made a Halfling Warrior to collect the comb thinking
it would be easier to get a port from Rivervale/Misty to Surefall...

I collect 6 honey comb and begin looking for a port.

/auction WTT 2 HQ Bear and 1 HQ Wolf Pelts for a port to Misty Thicket plz!

Someone types back,

/ooc We are IN Misty Thicket Hun

Well @$%#$% I think to myself!  So I say,

/ooc SUREFALL!  LOL I meant SUREFALL!

Of course, no takers.  So, I log out the hobbit, log in the Barb and run her
to Surefall.

 /auction WTT 2 HQ Bear and 1 HQ Wolf Pelts for a port to Surefall Glade
plz!

Ok, I'm sure you can see where that went too right?  LOL

Anyway, cycle actually repeated itself once more before some kind halfling
in Rivervale took pity on me and not only ported my little Warrior, he held
the comb and dropped in on my Barb when I gave him the pelts.  He also
buffed the Barb really well.

It was just one of THOSE days and I thought I'd share...
hehe
