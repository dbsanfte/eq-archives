The problem isnt finding the right mobs... its finding the players to group
with. I like doing EK by the gnoll reavers (pull to the water edge where
they dont path), but you will be hard presssed to find a group here. You
might be able to find a group doing aviaks in SK during the day, but it
would suck. The aviak guards would also make good hunting with a healing
partner, but dont expect to find a group there. About the one place you
*can* expect to find a group is... wait for it.... loio by the windmill!
