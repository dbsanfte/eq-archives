My father died when I was 10, actually. and my mother takes care of my
grandmother every moment of the day.

what I EXPECT, is that you quit complaining, go get a fucking job, and earn
the shit like everybody else does.

your reply pretty much sums up what I thought of you, too. nice of you to
assume thtat just because somebody has something, their momma musta bought
it for them. that might be the case for 12 year olds but I am 23 bud.
