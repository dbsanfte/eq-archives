Most cable companies don't actually change people's dynamic addresses very
often, so what's wrong with using one of the dynamic DNS services?  Or just
get some personal web space somewhere (doesn't Comcast include some?) and
run a script at home that finds your IP address and uploads it to a page on
your web site.  You can check that from outside to find out what the current
IP address is.

You aren't nearly as screwed as a friend of mine.  His DSL is ~680k both
ways, which just cries out for running a server.  However, he is NATed at
the ISP!  I don't mean that his DSL modem is providing NAT...it is something
upstream that is doing it.  This means no servers for him.

The really weird thing is that the IP address his computer uses is NOT from
the usual ranges used for NAT.  In fact, the address they gave him is one
that is in a range assigned to a different ISP.  I have no idea if they are
just sloppy, or if they wanted to avoid the usual addresses so their
customers would be less likely to notice they are NATed.
