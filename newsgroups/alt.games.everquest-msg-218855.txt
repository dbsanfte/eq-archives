I wouldn't think that being FM would ever stack up unfavorably to bing dead:
# Xp loss = effective negative time
# wasting mana on rebuffs better spent on blowing holes through/healing rips
in things.
# rez just screws it all up, putting you at zero mana, low health, delay in
being able to stick for several important buffs
# recoup time, the time it takes to get back into 'the groove'

technically, by your definition, if noone hits fm, then noone had any
effective downtime (you'd have to slow down eventually or go oom, yes?)
