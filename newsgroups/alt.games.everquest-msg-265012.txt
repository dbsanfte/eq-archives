I assume you are talking about EQ2 --  There's a weird bug that showed up 
today.  Reboot your computer then repatch, shouldn't have that LD happen 
again.  There's a dev post in the beta forum about that.  Otherwise, there 
seems to be trouble all over in EQ2 today.  The new spells suck, crafting 
is totally impossible, Lagtonica is back and with a vengeance.  That game 
is totally not ready to go live on the 8th.  I'm glad I dont' have a pre-
order to cancel.
