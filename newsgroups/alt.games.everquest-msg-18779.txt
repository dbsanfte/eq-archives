Is a good spot very close by actually.... head from the Universal Flux
Agitator ( or the mill as some quaintly refer to it <g>) towards the
river, then keep going along the shoreline.  Go past the ruins and the
area between the ruins and the sarnak fortress has good stuff to get you
to 30 pretty quickly.  Pull kitties to the shore and fear kite, charm
kitties for pets, or just nuke the stuffing out of whatever you find
there depending on your preferences and abilities.  Should be able to
get them lvl 29 spells in no time, assuming you already have the coin,
not great loot in this area.
