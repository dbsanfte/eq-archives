No, it just doesn't look "female" at all, besides not having breasts.
The style of iksar helm covers up all but one of the horns on the head
which make you know its female if you are into iksar. 95 percent of
the players I've played with did not even know the character was
female, except the odd other iksar character. 

Seems they could have done more to make it seem female to me.
