Ok, I'll help you. Because it's nothing but an indication of a basic
lack of civility and respect. It's the same as settling disputes with
violence. It is the rudest way of expressing yourself.

The line from the movie Contact says it best. Do you love your
parents? Yes? Prove it. There is no proof. You just know you do.

I use profanity myself far too often. The thing is, I know the moment
I do that I have just done something crass, and that I'm wrong to do
so.
