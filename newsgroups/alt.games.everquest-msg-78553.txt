 Pumice stones do the same thing. Just not as convenient. However, much
easier to get.

 I have no idea on the percentage. I just know I've pulled a lot of mobs
that summoned during the fight that didn't bother to do it during the
pull. I used to think it was 10% but I'm pretty sure that's not the case
anymore. Maybe 1%? Personally, I don't know. All I know is I've never
been summoned on a pull if the mob was at full health.
