Generally, with the asian movies I have seen, while the original actors may
be very talented, it seems like they picked a bunch of high-school teenagers
looking for a summer job to do the voice overs.  The dubbed versions just
ruin my suspension of disbelief.

I find I can forget that I am reading the subtitles much easier than I can
put out of my mind the fact a film is dubbed.  I equate dubbed films to a
recent experience where I went in a theater and somone had thrown something
on the screen and stained it.  No matter how much I tried to get into the
film, I just kept seeing that damned stain -- on the actress's nose, in the
sky, on the side of a car, etc.  Dubbing, if noticeable at all, has the same
effect.

Given that people can be classified into aural or visual learners, I'm sure
there will always be some that find dubbed films more preferrable to
subtitled and vice versa.
