}Yeah, tried it for a while, ended up keeping the world, and using several

Heh, I _loved_ the Fantasy Hero rules.  Especially the magic system, and 
the magic items system.  Although I do remember one time I made a warrior 
characterwho had some magic charm that raised a couple of his stats to 
some incredible level once a day, under an extreme set of limitations... 
It ended up basically being an exploit.  It was my first true lesson in 
how exploits can really take the fun out of a game.  We went through all 
the adventuring part, and went up to face off with the truly big bad guy.  
My warrior activated his charm, took one swing with his big pick, and 
smeared him all over the wall.  The GM wasn't very happy with that.  
Ultimately, neither was I.  Still, it's gotta be the most versatile rules 
set I've ever seen.
