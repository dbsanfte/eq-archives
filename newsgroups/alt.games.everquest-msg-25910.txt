I disagree, I take AC over stats, my cleric ac buffed is about 900.  A dead
cleric with a 200 wis dose the party no good, or a cleric that keeps getting hit
and interrupted dose the party no good either.  I have been on raids where I was
the last cleric standing, the other lightly armored clerics all went down.  Oh
and as a human cleric my wisdom is 194, high ac wisdom items are out there, you
just need to look for them.

I never use a two handed weapon, I have a charred guardian shield in one hand
and a firebrand hammer or a paw of opula in the other.

"A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I advise
the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness,
enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the ball, and others
of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no character on the mind.
Let your gun therefore be your constant companion of your walks."
--Thomas Jefferson
