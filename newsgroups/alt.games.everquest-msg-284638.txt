I used the term MA rather than MT because I was aware that at some point 
they might be two different people, but my assumption was that for the 
foreseeable future they'd be one and the same.  Most of your notes 
below, though, seem to assume that they are two different people.

Why would you not want the MA to be the MT?  The MT, after all, is the 
guy who is engaging the target first.  And more importantly, is the one 
who gets to see whether his taunt succeded or failed, whether (at least 
in the case of SK MT) his hate increasing spells have landed, and thus 
is in the best position to say when he's got a good aggro lock.

I didn't suggest that the MA switch to a target thats going to need mez, 
I suggested that in some instances, a target which cannot be mezzed 
might arrive unexpectedly; if the Assist call has not gone out yet, the 
original target could be mezzed and the new target selected instead.

If, on the other hand, some members of the raid assist early and are 
actively doing damage to the original target, it has now become 
essentially unmezzable.

Here's where the "MA is not MT" thing confuses my point.  My letter 
generally assumed MA = MT.  If they aren't the same, then yes, you are 
correct, its the MT that is building the hate.  But the rest of my point 
stands.

Since people aren't waiting for the assist call, I feel they are somehow 
missing the point of why they should.  Shouldn't I be ennumerating every 
reason I can think of for this, instead of just glossing over it with a 
Martha Steward "assist call, its a good thing" (tm)?
