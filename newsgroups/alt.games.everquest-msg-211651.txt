Required means you need to be that level to equip the item.  Recommended
means to have the stats that the weapon oritem has then you need to be that
level.  Otherwise that 12/18 sword may only be a 1/18 sword .

I have also heard stories from people who have items that had a required
level higher than they were.  They were keeping them in their backpacks
until they were high enough to use them.  Then they got killed by a mob and
when they went to loot their corpses the items were gone.  I do not know if
this is fact or fiction but it is something I would definitiely investigate
if you get the idea of carrying stuff that is too high of level for you.
