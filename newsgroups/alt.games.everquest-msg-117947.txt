Ok, first of all, don't panic. You're level twelve, which means that
your corpse has gear on it, and it *shouldn't* [1] decay for a solid
week. (Real time. Not game time.) Also, at level twelve, you're not
going to lose enough xp to worry about a rez, so we can forget the rez
timer.

Now, a number of things might have happened. If you didn't get a /loc
before you died, it's possible that you're looking in the wrong area.
The catacombs can be confusing. Or, even if in the right area, when you
died you may have fallen into a wall, with only your toes sticking out.
Very hard to find that way. If that's the case, it's *posssible* that
one of the safety net features of the game moved your corpse to the zone
in area. Check there.  If you still can't find it, you need to go
looking around the neighborhood for either a bard or a necro. Doesn't
matter much what level, as long as they are near to yours.

A bard can do a locate corpse trick to lead you right to the corpse.
Necros can also do this, plus, if you have the money to pay for a coffin
(material spell component) they can actually summon your corpse to you
at the zone line. If the necro is level 12 or more, they can do this I
believe. They can track it at either level one or level four. I forget.

Court of last resort, if you can't find it, and can't find anybody else
to help you get it, wait until a business day this week when GM's are
online and do a /petition. If you are a true newbie losing all your
worldly goods on a level 12 corpse in Qeynos, just explain that you've
looked for a bard or necro to help you to no avail, be polite and
respectful and ask nicely, and the GM will likely summon it for you. 
They generally do that unless you get one having a really bad day.

[1] I say your corpse *shouldn't* decay before a week is up because the
whole corpse management system can be rather screwy at times, and it's
not impossible for a brand new, fully equipped corpse to just poof after
a short time. But it's highly unlikely. In that event, /petition about
having lost all your stuff on a bugged/poofed corpse. Occasionally the
GM with give you a "starter kit" to get you back on your feet, with some
gear appropriate to your level. Again, just be polite and act nice and
they'll likely help you.
