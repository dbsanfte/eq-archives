  But resist the temptation to do this.  You will go nuts if you try it.
  Actually, when I first started, I had an idea that I would try to do
just that.  That way I would be be meeting more people, and have a
chance at making more friends.  I actually made it onto a good half
dozen or so servers.  Made a few friends on each, also.  But then, I got
attached to one of my characters on Drinal, and ended up staying there
for the next year till I made the move to FV.
   One word of advice.  If you have any friends you know of who play a
particular server, you may want to go with that one.  Seems like obvious
advice, but it didn't connect with me at the time.  I was introduced to
the game by a real life friend who play on 7th hammer.  By the time I
figured out that I was getting real attached to my Drinal characters, it
was too late to join him.  Just as well, it turns out, because he is a
freak who plays for 25 hours at a time, and comes this >< close to
putting his fist through a wall on patch days.
