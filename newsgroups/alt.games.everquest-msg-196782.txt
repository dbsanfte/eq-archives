Well, here's mine at 51 - I'm completely untwinked. Hope your netscape can
at least read Magelos, even if you can't set one up!

I've gone for mostly for AC - I get to about 920 when buffed. Most of my
stuff is really cheap as I tend to save up for "big" items (JBB, drogma -
about 1k to go!), and skimp on everything else.

Much of your stuff doesn't really look twinked for a 28. The only things
that stick out are:
Ceremonial Iksar Chestplate - this one really really makes a big difference
at your level and lower
Silver Chitin Hand Wraps

and maybe these, but not really due to mudflation (i.e. you wouldn't have
these untwinked a year ago)
Sarnak Battleshield
Black Alloy Medalion

Your twinkee status is dropping off rapidly as you level - you're just
reaching the stage where characters start to make reasonable money on their
own, as you've discovered!
