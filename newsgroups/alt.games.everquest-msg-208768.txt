Our guild isn't even in the elemental planes yet and according to Magelo
I have (had) 372 wisdom. This was without having necessarily paid
attention to wisdom alone in my item selection in the past 6 months
(main focus has been hp and mana after capping ft). I know the int
casters in my guild are basically in the same boat as well. Even with
your cap raised to 355 with AA you also get a free 28 int/wis from VoQ
so at max you need 327 int/wis and with the items you see on the way to
Time this is not hard at all to have.
