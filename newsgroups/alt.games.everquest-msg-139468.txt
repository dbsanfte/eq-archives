 Yeah, none of the giants seem to like that. We make sure everyone is
standing when we pull statue/idol/aow. Of course, not much you can do in
the instances of being ambushed.

 He's the trigger mob for AoW. So if you try him, please don't slow him.
If you can't kill an unslowed Idol you're not going to be able to take
