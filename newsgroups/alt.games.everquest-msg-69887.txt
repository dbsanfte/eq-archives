If it makes you feel any better, a guildie dropped his 51 magician to
start an iksar SK for the simple fact that with the amount of
magicians in the guild already there was going to be a VERY long wait
for help with his epic. There were absolutely NO iksar SK's in the
guild so he has first dibs on the iksar SK only stuff that drops in
the planes while the other SK's have to divvy up the "other SK" items.
