   You would think that that would be right, wouldn't you?  I did,
but it never worked for me.  I finally broke down and RTFM.  It's
actually Alt-P, the "p" standing for "party".
   Also, the first time I got it to come up, it was "hidden" behind
another semitransparent window, and hard to see.  I was able to click
on the top of the window, and you can do this with all the windows 
go semitransparent, I believe, and drag to to place where I could 
actually use it.  
   I believe this view is call full window view, btw, though I could
be mistaken about that.
