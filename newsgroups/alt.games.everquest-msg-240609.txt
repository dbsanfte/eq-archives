Well - it all depends on how many HP the necro has and whether the
mage gets lucky with a crit.  Even with the 2/3rds damage rule, a
nice FoT crit will hit for 2800+  But now you're in straight dueling
land, and mages aren't the best duelers out there.

Without any caster support the epic pet will win simply due to the DS, and 
the incredible proc rate on its stuns, this has been demonstrated in pet
on pet action between mages - BL's and Necros.  Get rid of the DS (use 61
air for example) and things get much more even.
