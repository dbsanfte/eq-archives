   On Firiona Vie?  I know that we did have a "Whosyourdaddy" for quite a while,
but that might very well have been a first name.  There was quite a bit of
bitching about him on the FV community board, though it seems SoE took it's
sweet time talking to him, if in fact they ever did.  
   Other names that raise ire on FV: "Patio Furniture" and "Cleric", whose last
name for a while was "Oftunare".
