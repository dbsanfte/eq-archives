> Looking for additional input.

It's already being worked on by several projects, notably this one,
which is very close to actually working:
http://www.eqemulator.net/

However, this completely defeats the purpose of the MM in MMORPG or
MMOG. If you consider you and 10 other people in a tiny rip-off world
a massive multiplayer online experience... well, you aren't getting
it.

The reality is that the server content is what the game is all about,
and you can't recreate that without hiring several designers and
testers (and have a LOT of time on your hands, and some serious cash).
And even if you did and it was anything close to what EQ actually is,
you'd be infringing on copyright and (rightly so) get sued into the
ground.

In other words, while eq emulator projects are interesting, they will
never actually be anything like EQ.

If you want to play EQ, you _have_ to buy it. Otherwise you're merely
playing some ripoff, that is guaranteed to be small and buggy, and has
nothing to do with what it is that we all think when we talk about EQ.
(That's by no means ment offensive to the eq emulator people - i think
what they are trying and succeeding in doing is impressive - but it is
NOT EQ - it's just compatible with the client)

Oh, and please don't cross post like that.
