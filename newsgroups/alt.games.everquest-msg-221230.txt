/em self mocking laugh.... Your Absolutely right :(  I know exactly what
your talking about players not valuing versatility.
My druid is finally seen as usefull in groups, but its taken 65 levels to
get that.

Sigh.... I really, REALLY dont want to see the Knights nerfed. Hell I dont
want ANYONE to get nerfed. All I want is a fighting chance, heck Id even
take a decrease in the refresh time on Taunt as a start to a fix. Combine
that with a 50/50 chance of taunt working for Warr's and Id even call it
fixed :P

Yaya.. I know... Not a chance in hell of that happening.

Thats a creative, and interesting solution..... Of course that has instantly
consigned it to purgatory now :P
