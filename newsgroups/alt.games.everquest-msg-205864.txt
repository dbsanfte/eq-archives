C'mon, first you're 59, then you're 58.  You're retired, yet, you're 
killing Stormy, Lodi, etc. . .

You're the Misinformation Queen!!!  *wink*

Oh, wait.  My .sig says my Rogue is 39, and he died in CoM while I was 
killing Faydedar yesterday so now he's 38.  That's what I get for 
practicing sneak/hide and fogetting to leave him in hide mode when I 
started forming groups.

I've also noticed the behaviour of a mob getting more pissed on a resist 
than on that spell landing.  The one spell that I use where I have the 
opportunity to notice this the most is *drum roll* Slow.  What a 
coincidence, eh?  I'm sure one of these experimental people will figger it 
out for us.
