As the player of a 30 druid, a 19 chanter, and a 16 monk, I must say that 
soloing gets BORING. I can't seem to get motivated to really go out and 
play my druid these days, as I prefer the team dynamics of my monk or 
chanter.

home. I just gave up after a while. I figure if I want to talk
to me, I'll just have to do it in person.)" -Walker
