Sorry but you have no understanding whatsoever of the psychology
behind ideologues such as these. Being ' pissed off ' doesn't enter into
the equation at all. They are acting not out of a sense of rage, but 
as a duty to Allah.

Why people can't grasp what your saying is because it's a superficial, 
juvenile and uninformed analysis of what's going on. One of the most
serious transgressions confirming America is the Evil Empire to bin 
Laden was the fact_women_ were in uniform when American troops 
were in Saudi Arabia. Not _what_they were doing, but the simple fact
that women in uniform was a serious violation of his particular interpretation 
of the Koran.

Utter bullshit. If you had the slightest understanding of history you would be 
aware that terrorism has no correlation to any country flexing money or
might. Northern Ireland and the Basque are two ongoing examples of this.

The Taliban generally and bin Laden specifically are psychotic 
religious zealots and their actions are a product of a warped psyche 
not as you ignorantly imply a justifiable and understandable reaction 
to a proactive America.
