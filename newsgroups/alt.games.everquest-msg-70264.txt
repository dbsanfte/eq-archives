I just finished weekend number 2 with my vah shir beastlord. I got her
to 13th level and that required killing a large number of Loda Kai.
Since the Loda Kai are somewhat aligned with the Gor Taku i was taking
faction hits. Since I started I noticed that i was dubious to Gor Taku
and KOS to the Shak Dratha. I figured there must have been a reason
somewhere to why the Loda Kai are alinged with them and why Im kos to
shak dratha. The NPCs give conflicting stories about who to go after.
Has anyone who has leveld a Vah Shir so far encountered another race
aligned with the Shak Dratha? I adventured into the caves a little bit
and noticed them populated mainly with Gor Taku. After killing so many
brigands i ended up kos to them so i would go kill any Shak Dratha I
saw to get the faction back up enough so I could safely go back into
the caves without getting mobbed. Any reason I should choose one side
or the other? Im sure as I level Im gonna see the big picture but I
hope I wasnt suckered into killing the wrong guys.
