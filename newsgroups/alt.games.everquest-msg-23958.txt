 Sang, I hate to break it to you but not everyone is as Uber as you.
Some guilds are just up and coming and Fear/Hate are good zones to learn
the raid ropes. Just because some guilds have no problem clearing a zone
with 12 people others aren't so fortunate. Also those zones provide some
nice items for some people that don't have better. Just because you (or
I) consider most items there 'junk' which usually rots doesn't mean it's
junk for other guilds out there.

 True. But I agree with his point of view. If you want xp you don't go
to Fear. I'm not saying you wont get any but there are (I know I've
gotten good xp there before) but it's just not the sort of place you go
if you just want xp. If you get xp fine but that's normally why you're
not there.
