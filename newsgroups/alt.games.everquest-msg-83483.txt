Don't be so quick to thank him, he is wrong.  You can hotkey any of the 8
gem slots into any of the 10 hotkey slots on any of the hotkey banks.  You
hotkey a spell gem exactly the same way as you hotkey any other button.
This does not give you more than 8 spells available at once, just duplicates
an existing spell gem slot with a hotkey.  If you change the spell in that
gem slot, then the spell on the hotkey changes as well.  You can also hotkey
a spell by putting "/cast <gem slot number>" in a social.  For example
"/cast 1" will cast the spell that is in your first gem slot.  This allows
you to add in color, and/or informative comments regarding what you are
casting.
