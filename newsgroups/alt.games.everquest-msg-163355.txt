In his two posts Kaev has very ably dealt with your trying to
weasel out of your original implication, so I won't rehash that
here.

I will, however, say that it's remarkably childish of you to
bring your obvious bitterness over an off-topic political
discussion into an on-topic thread, especially since
you weren't even a participant in that thread, and thus you
don't even have the cheap excuse of being upset with me for
personally taking issue with something you had said.
