Hello All;

I'm new to EQ and have made a Hafling Cleric.  I picked the Hafling race
because I read they have Sneak and Hide.  I've just made level 10. However,
Sneak and Hide do not seem all that good. It's like half the monsters can
see me. I notice that my skills go up as I use them, except these 2. How do
you improve the usefulness of these skills if I can't raise them to a better
level?  Or, do they just stay at some fixed level and no matter how high my
level is they are just so so abilities?

Thanks in advance for your time.
