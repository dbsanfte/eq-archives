Yesterday a guy on SZ asked me to teach him Vah Shir by grouping with him
and repeatedly hitting hotbuttons to say things in Vah Shir.  I don't spend
and practice points or time learning languages, since everyone speaks the
Common Tongue anyway, with very few exceptions.  As I understand the
language system this should have worked, though... but his language skill
stayed at 3 for about 20 mins of doing this, even though he got several
messages in his chat window saying that the skill went up.  Anyone have any
idea why?
