Well, because in certain situations, they are.  Generally not directly, 
but a DEX buff makes weapons proc more often, and some procs are very, 
very nice.  I will ALWAYS ask for a DEX buff, since it means that I can 
put my epic in off-hand, and still get it to proc enough to keep my group 
hasted 55% with +30 to both ATK and STR.  Would I want DEX buffs in a 
caster group?  Nope, but with melee-types with proccing weapons, oh yeah 
you better believe I like DEX buffs.
