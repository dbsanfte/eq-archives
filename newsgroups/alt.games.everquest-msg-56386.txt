    It may be implemented only because of DAoC, but we HAVE wanted this for
a while. 8) So, has anyone popped as Fippy yet?

    I wonder how high "have very high faction" will turn out to be?

    About time this was fixed. Goodbye to that griefer at the Qeynos gates.

This means

    Heh. No more zerging Statue!

Warrens.

    About time. If the only point of TLC is to delay farmers so those who
want to adventure and are the target levels can adventure freely, then it
should expire after a set amount of time.

    But did they keep the teleporting gnome?

    FINALLY! Sol B has been fixed! Where this always caught people was when
you died next to an interior wall - interior walls are very buggy. Ask
people in Chardok for details.

    The widened XP range likely won't matter - the old XP penalties on "high
greens" made them very unattractive to kill, and I doubt those have been
removed. But being able to tell if something is XP-giving or not will be
great. I like to log on my baby warrior and clear out the entry hallway on
Lower Guk dead side while checking the friends list to decide what to do
that day. Many of the frogs are green, but many of the greens give XP. Now
I'll know exactly which to kill and which to skip over.

    Very nice for the raid crowd. Good that they caught the grief-factor
with illusions, too. Can anyone think of any other grief-inducing uses of
/targetgroupbuff? It'd be nice to get a petition in to VI ASAP about them,
so they can be patched in the inevitable emergency patch.

    A good start. One would hope that eventually they'd have some system
that can recognize when an inventory would be overflowed from a transaction,
and cancel the transaction by putting all items back where they were taken
from.

>- Added code that prevents player characters from dropping coins on the
ground.  This

    Insert tempest in a teapot from monks here. It would be nice if
eventually, in conjunction with the above proposed fix, this was extended to
all items. No more druid droppings - eat, save, or destroy!

    So will clerics now compete for the biggest CHeal ever? 8)

    I must be tired. Can anyone summarize what this means to a person with
low and high foraging skills?

    Nice patch!
