1) Either you are a troll looking for some attention.
or
2) When you say you have "played just about every class in the game" its
been for about 10 levels each.

Face it. Each class has its own strengths and weaknesses. It's an issue of
class balance. Wars are made for dealing out the damage in melee and soaking
it up. Pure and simple. No other purpose. All other classes damage tables
are based off of them and subsequently, less than theirs.

True, you dont' get to gate. You don't get pets. You don't get any of those
fancy sprite creating magic abilities. But then again, NO ONE can dish out
the damage like a War can. Yes you will do CR's, but once you get past the
initial "learning" phase of the game, you'll be grouping with people who can
res or port you back to your corpse. CR's become a trivial thing. When you
sit down and do the analysis, even at level 15, a decently equiped War will
out damage just about any other class in melee by a long shot. That's what
you were made for. But yes, it can get a little bit tedious, hack/slash, get
healed, hack/slash, get healed, etc. But hey, how do you think clerics deal
with it? Heal, buff, heal, buff, etc. Or enchanters, mezz, mezz, mezz, more
mezz.
If you don't like playing a War, then stop. Don't put down the whole class.
That won't get you anywhere.

Another reason for your post just came to mind. You were soloing somewhere
you shouldn't have been, got ganked, no one would res you and you had to do
the CR thing. It happens. Get used to it. Happens to all of us.
