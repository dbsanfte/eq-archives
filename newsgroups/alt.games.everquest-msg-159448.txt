Heh, it is from the intro to each episode of "The Prisoner", a British
TV series that was a sequel to the series "Secret Agent Man".  "The
Prisoner" is, IMO, the best TV series ever aired, no other comes close.

Number 2: "We want information"
Number 6: "You won't get it!"
Number 2: "By hook or by crook, we will"
Number 6: "Who are you?"
Number 2: "I am Number 2"
Number 6: "Who is Number 1?"
Number 2: "You are Number 6"
Number 6: "I am not a number, I am a free man!"
Number 2: "Ahahahahaha"
