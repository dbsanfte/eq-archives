This idea, which isn't to bad on teh face of it, would break the common
tactic of using Revive/Rez along with Summon Corpse to ferry across rading
parties. Most commonly used in the Plane of Sky, among other places...

I'm not familiar with the Cleric line of spells, but differences in casting
time may also make a difference in what one whould choose for rezzing in the
midst of combat, perhaps choosing a faster spell in exchange for less XP
returned.
