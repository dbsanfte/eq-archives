I'm a level 34 bard and I use a Crystal Grinder and Icetooth Claws as
my main weapons.  Like most people I'm interested in upgrading to
something which does more damage.  The problem I have is I don't know
what weapons to upgrade to.  If anyone could possibly recommend a set
of better (and not impossible to obtain) weapons I would be extremely
grateful.
