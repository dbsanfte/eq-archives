I was already seriously pissed at my then-guild. I detest being treated 
as the rez-ho, not grouped with because they had a shammy/druid to heal 
then asked to come and rez them. I was tired of helping everybody else 
get their epics,  but they couldnt be bothered to help me by tracking 
burgurgle when i asked....yet they whine about me not having my 
epic...and it took a non-guilded buddy and i less than an hour to get 
him one saturday...[i kept my then 28 ranger camped out in and 49 cleric 
bound in lake rathe for 4 weeks trying to catch him up. i found out in 
guild chat he was up by some arswipe that I just rezzed telling someone 
else about burgurgle after we had spent several minutes joking about why 
i had bound my cleric in such an absurd place. he KNEW i needed that 
stupid gobbo and didnt tell me that he was up, instead told someone who 
had been in the guild less time than i, and was only 42nd level.

Aza as a friend was worth putting myself through Sky to get part of her 
epic. Anybody else could have gone and packed sand before i would have 
helped them to that extent. A hole raid? sure, not a problem...najenas 
for the pages? not a problem..I even helped in CoM. Sky? no way in hell.
aru
though i would love to get the quest mace for clerics...mana proc=) but 
i am not guilded now, and the only way i could get up there is a as a 
guest, and no way will a guild let a nonguild roll on drops.
