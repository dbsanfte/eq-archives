That's nice...however the 35 Rogue I regularly group with cannot do that
kind of damge at this point.  She can hit for 100, sometimes more ( I don't
always catch her damage statements), but no one in my party hits a total of
350 or better in one shot.  The life bar of the mob in quite a few instances
drops significantly after a good nuke.  The whole thing was just to say that
wizards are not as useless as some would believe.
