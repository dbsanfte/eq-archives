 He was 27 as of about midnight pst.  In HHK.

But I have a question.  IS that really the best place to PL a
character in the mid 20's? The ratio is nice, but the amount of spawns
and spawn time is kinda low.  The times that I've spent there seemed
to be a fair amount of downtime unless we were pulling more than one
camp. (and sometimes even then)

Woudl not Sol A be better? The xp bonus is close, but there are a lot
more mobs in the dungeon to drag to their PL'd doom.  Anyone else have
thoughts?
