Tell her that if you use VNC while using Everquest quite often, the game
will boot you to the desktop.  By using the contraband EQW, one could
access their Everquest account from another computer if they are so
inclined.  The only problem the person telling me about all this has had
is that the mouse goes wonky on EQ when accessed via VNC whether EQW is
used or not.  With the slightest movement it jumps from one side of the
window to another.  So your wife's best friend could chat and look up
stuff in the bazaar, but that's about it.
