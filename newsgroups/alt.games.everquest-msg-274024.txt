He's not exaggerating anything.  I agree with him 100%.

One refers to someone who is a coward and other is just calling someone
a jerk in general.  Different meanings, yes.  But they definitely still
do both refer to the human body.  And you can rank words as being more
or less profane than other words even when they do have different
meanings.

It's not a coincidence that the same word refers to a wimp and to a
woman's body.  He was entirely right when he talked about taking a
stereotype of women as weak, then taking a profane word for a woman's
anatomy, and putting those two things together to come up with an
insult.  It's a metaphor.
