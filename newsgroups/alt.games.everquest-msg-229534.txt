Actually I'd expect enchanters to do very well.  You may be in love with
charm, but I really don't think it will be useful on this server, even if
they have it.   Charm is too unreliable.  You're not going to get time to
run through the zone looking for X monster to charm, buff and then take to a
battle.   Charm soloing in PVE may work great on the regular servers... but
thats mostly because the experience is high enough that the speed of the
gain offsets the experience lost to deaths.  The extreme riskiness of that
strategy does not go well in a "hardcore" (permanent death) enviroment.

One big advantage to them is tash.   It compounds the caster advantage of
everyone having low resistances, and makes their nukes much more effective.
Mez and stun also work on players.  And work quite well, when the players
have negative magic resistance.

DoT's are not generally something you want to rely on, IMO.   I've seen many
battles with DoT'ers that ended up with both combatants dying.   A partial
win like that is something you cannot afford in a hardcore environment.
