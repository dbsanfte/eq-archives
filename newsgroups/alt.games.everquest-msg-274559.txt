Guild search function seems to be nonexistent in EQ2.  The /who command 
totally ignores guilds.  I'd KINDA like to join a guild soon, but I have no 
idea how to research what is a good or bad guild when I can't do a /who on a 
really nice person I saw in ooc, or a jerk in ooc to find out their guild 
affiliation (if any).  The command /guildstatus doesn't exist either.

Oh, here's a thread in eq2's forum when I did a search for "/who guild"
