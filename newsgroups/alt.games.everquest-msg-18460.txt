What's your home town?  Mine is Neriak, and you buy the paper from a new
merchant outside of the Mage/Wiz/Ench guild.  She stands next to a cart. I
think its like 3 silver for the paper and she won't buy it back after you've
read it.

Most places have the paper for sale not too far from the bank.

Good luck.
