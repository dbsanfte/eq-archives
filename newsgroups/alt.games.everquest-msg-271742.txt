Actually no, we all came over from SWG and already had a group ready, which 
brings me to: how many of your friends are playing?  You only need 6 people 
to start, really not too hard if you have people who will be playing with 
you from another game/guild/clan.  The hardest part was getting the silver, 
and even that wasnt too difficult, we had everything we needed once we all 
gained citizenship.

Starting a guild by yourself however would be a royal pain.  Word of advice, 
don't make anyone you don't completely trust a leader as you cannot by any 
means remove them from the guild if you decide you want to for whatever 
reason.  Sounds simple, but there can be more than one person with the rank 
of leader, and since they are of equal rank, cannot remove each other.  You 
would think that the founder would be able to kick anyone he/she wanted to, 
but it isn't that way.  Maybe they will change that later after enough 
feedback, who knows.

Good luck with your guild, hope you find the right people!
