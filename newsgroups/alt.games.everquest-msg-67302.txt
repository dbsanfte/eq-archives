Did you COMPLETELY remove the old 3dfx drivers before installing the
new card?

What is the chipset on your Motherboard? If it is made by VIA download
and install the latest Via 4in1 Driver set (version 4.35)
www.viahardware.com

What are the AGP settings in your system BIOS? (The 3dfx card did not
take advantage of AGP, the Nvidia card does)
Set AGP Aperture to 128mb
Enable Fast Writes
Enable AGPX4 if supported by your MB


Cheers
