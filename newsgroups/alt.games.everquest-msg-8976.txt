I do hope you'll let us know their response.

Yup. He's one sandwich shy of a picnic basket, alright.

I'm inclined to think not, in all honesty. He has all the classic
symptoms of a blow-hard bully-boy who gets off on attacking people who
either won't or can't hit back.

Indeed it isn't. His knee-jerk reaction is to trawl usenet's archives
for info on his intended target. Yet he doesn't recognise his own
actions as "stalking".

He's also received death threats in other newsgroup(s?)... it is a
hobby for him.
