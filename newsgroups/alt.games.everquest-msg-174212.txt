Something similar happened to us last night, except that a party wound up
with 4% health showing red in the zone, all while he was making his way back
from his bind point in the PoK. There was actually a conversation in which
he said "I'm dead" and got the response "No, you're still alive and in the
zone, with 4% health", "No, I'm at the PoK naked and very dead", followed by
variations on "Huh?"
