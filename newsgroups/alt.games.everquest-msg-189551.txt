True of any mob with a ranged attack (goblins in DC for instance will 
shoot you with arrows).  It's mainly the damage on the spells they're 
casting that's a pain.

Nah, it's not anywhere near bottomless.  They do tend to blow their wad 
pretty quickly though, so once they've stopped casting you know you've 
pretty much got 'em if you're still alive and have enough to not die from 
their DS (time to invest in a 2 hander) ;)

Compared to standard warrior-type mobs, the wizards have very few HP and 
do go down quickly once you work through their rune.

PC wizards can crit for more than my total HP with virtue :P  Haven't had 
the pleasure of being nuked to death in a single blow by an NPC yet :P

Clerics' nukes aren't nearly as bad as wizard's.  It's just a matter of 
effectively beating down 3 of 'em in a row if they get their CHs off.  
Haven't seen one have enough mana to do more than that.  What's a real 
pain is when they're DS'd by the wizard around the corner :P
