    About half the classes can solo effectively, most CAN solo but its a
serious compromise, and for some it just isn't viable at all.

    Necro would be the most popular soloer, however a bard, druid,
beastlord, or shaman would have no trouble whatsoever reaching 70 just by
soloing - and getting some gear at the same time.

    Enchanter and wizard can also solo all the way to 70 without too much
trouble, but take more effort and risk at the higher levels.

    Mages are ok to begin with but slowly convert into a fairly crappy solo
class. They remain technically solo capable at 70, but getting a group as a
mage is so effortless it isn't worth the bother learning to solo at high
level.

    The remaining hybrids can all solo to a degree, particularly in some
level ranges, but it is not recommended to play any of these as a solo
class.

    No pure melee is much of a soloer.

cheers,
James
