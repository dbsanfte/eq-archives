AFAIK the courier does not spawn at the DE camp, but gets there fast. I would
say if you can't get there fast enough, bind between the DE camp and MM, so you
can kill the necro and Gate right to the ideal spot to take out the courier. I
haven't gotten off my butt to do this one yet though :P (so many quests, so
little time between tping transportationally-challenged people).
