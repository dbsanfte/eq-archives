Yes, and the mob still dies and leaves a corpse, just
as it does with a damage shield death.  There's obviously
*something* unique about rains;  the only visible difference
is the damage component is handled individually.  That's
where I'd get a "caster casts spell and DD is checked" on
the first wave, with the other waves being cast internally.
Attribution wouldn't seem to be an issue;  I've seen mobs
die (and leave corpses) after the caster has died before.
