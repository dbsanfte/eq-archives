What is meant is for all intents and purposes 'Irrelevant'. For the most 
part it simply doesn't really matter what your starting stats are.

Isn't really that bad? I suppose it could be worse.... but it could be 
so much batter too.

The 'main' complaint about the various combat issues, is that the game 
system lacks numerous 'improvements'. From mobs walking/agroing through 
walls, to being 'distracted' by the MT for the duration of combat, etc.

Changes I would consider making:
1) Implement blocking. A few warriors blocking a passage should keep the 
mob off the cleric behind them.

2) Mobs should organize themselves the same way.

3) Mobs that are not engaged should hit much much harder. As 'efficient' 
as ignoring all the mobs but one while you kill one at a time is its a 
ridiculous situation. 15 guys can't really effectively fight with one 
opponent, especially when that guys 4 friends are being totally 
ignored... should make it easy for them to find some weaknesses to exploit.

4) Larger combats. Again, a group of 4-6 people gang banging single mobs 
while their friends look on is very efficient, but not terribly 
realistic. If I were a mob and someone whacked me, I wouldn't go blindly 
chasing him to an out of the way alley while my 'pacified' friends just 
stood back in the distance... I'd smack them myself to wake them up, or 
ring the alarm, spawning an appropriate force to take on the threat.

6) Make archery an actual part of the game, not just a side feature.

7) Dynamic spawns. If the group is 40th level and their clearing some 
camp, start spawning tougher/more creatures, or stop respawning... if my 
village was getting butchered I would come back with friends, or not at all.

There are many ways that the combat system could be changed. Some of you 
love it the way it is... and that's why I'm not suggesting they change 
EQ1. But theres no reason why that should prevent sony from catering to 
people who would like to see some of those changes made.

dynamic quests (kill or at least maime walkthrus), in game personalized 
hints/clues + loot that spawns for me and drops when I kill the target, 
and it always drops and only lootable by me... many more improvements 
possible here.
