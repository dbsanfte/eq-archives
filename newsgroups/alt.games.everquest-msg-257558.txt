Whenever eq runs in background on my machine, it stops taking its fair share
of processor time....
for example if I do a ctrl-alt-del to bring up the task manager, its frame
rate will drop badly, but according to the task manager its only using a
small percentage of cpu time, and almost 90% is going into the system idle
process. Its not getting anywhere near the desired frame rate, so that isnt
whats causing the problem.

Most people have the problem that eq hogs too much processor time in
background, but my problem is the reverse!
Any ideas how to fix this? I suppose I could launch eq at high priority, but
surely at normal priority it should run at close to 100% is nothing else is
happening?
TIA
