I find this quite shocking.  I have only played an assassin to the
sub-class selection point and both the scout->predator and the
predator->assassin quests were solo.  And they weren't too difficult.
It was easy to mess up and die in both quests as they involved sneaking
around past mobs which were too tough for me.  The assassin quest
involved sneaking past red++ groupx2 mobs but the aim was to be an
assassin and you were only required to kill one white con mob to
complete it.

If you have the understanding of your task right and you do need to
kill mobs that are too tough to solo then I think that that is very
wrong.  You shouldn't need to group to progress your class selection.
It's something only you are interested in so it must be very difficult
to get group mates to kill them unless the mobs are part of other
quests.

Is this really the case?  How many of the class progression quests are
not solo?
