I found that I could kill evens and yellow np at those levels using the Fear
technique, but....  that way the pet was taking too much of the EXP, so I
switched to the double act method of pet and I both hammering away and stuck
to blue's, that way I flew through the lvls, although I did find 10 - 12 to
be rather slow still, compared some other classes I have played. I found
that once I had hit 12 and got the new spells, then my necro was what I had
been looking for, go find a nice yellow, DoT the hell out of it, fear it and
send in the pet.... yummy, one dead beastie, whilst I am happily meddin,
just don't med to close LOL...mob seems to take that as an insult.....  he
he

Probably better methods out there, that's just what I did, and it worked fer
me.
