The usual excuse in fantasy settings is that some of them *are* female. 
They just don't look any different to a human, short of close examination. 
It's not uncommon with animals to have less apparent gender traits.  For
example, if you were looking at a wolf, could you tell whether it was male
or female without lifting the tail?  :)

The real excuse is that it probably never occured to Verant, and besides,
they only had very limited space in the model files for each zone when the
game first came out.  (EQ used to run on a mere 2MB video card.)
