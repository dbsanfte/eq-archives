On test, if you decide to type /testbuff, your lowbie character will
magically be promoted to level 25, be given all appropiate spells, and
3 packs of starting gear that are on the ok side.  To give an idea, my
formerly level 11 ogre shaman, who started by dumping as much as she
could into widom, then the rest into stamina, ended up with the stats:
HP-557, AC-491, ATK-490, STR-113, STA-122, AGI-95, DEX-78, WIS-157,
INT-63, CHA-51.  One's skills do not raise to reflect one's new level.

    This is, Sony says, so that the people on Test can explore more
places and test more content easier.  I doubt that this will make it
to proddie servers.

   Obviously, starting on Test just got alot easier.  Dunno if this is
generally a good thing or not.  But it could be a good thing for the
AGE guild... if any of you might be interested in that.

Sorry if this has been posted elsewhere.
