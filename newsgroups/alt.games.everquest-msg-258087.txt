Conversely, my guild almost always uses 9/K instead of symbol, *shrug*.  
Usually, a 70% extended symbol will last for a boss or two, as well.  Our 
casters put a lot more store in the extra 8 mana.  The difference I think 
it makes is that when we're done clearing trash, we're all pretty close to 
FM and good to go for the boss fight almost right away.  Some fights can 
go on for 10 minutes.  8 mana a tic makes about 800 mana, or 2-3 extra 
nukes from me, 2-3 extra CH's from the cleric.  When it's down to the 
wire, that can make a lot more difference, in my opinion.

Personally, I'll just take 9.  You can keep the K. :)

And -here- we are in aboslute, complete, total agreement. :)  Well, except 
the shaman, everyone should have focus regardless, unless they need the MR 
from some self-buff it doesn't stack with. :)  But that same page bit is 
-big-.
