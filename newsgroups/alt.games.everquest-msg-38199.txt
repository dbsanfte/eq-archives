*snort* -- that depends entirely on who's doing the
scoring, doesn't it?  It's traditional for participants
in a fight to overrate their own performance,
that's why judges score boxing matches, not the fighters.
From where I sit, Bizbee has come out on the short 
end of a fight here quite a few times.

He's reasonably formidable as long as he stays
clearheaded, but he has lost more than one exchange
by letting his propensity to get overemotional
(e.g. defensive, irate, hypersensitive, or belligerent)
take over and shoot the quality of his material all 
to hell.  Even his reading comprehension suffers
noticeably when he's wound up, which further limits
the effectiveness of his retorts.

>almost always a moron doing the mouthing off.

That's one possible explanation.  Another is that Bizbee
thinks that his getting apoplectic and screeching
"ignorant fuckwit!" several times when someone nails
him constitutes some sort of victory on his part,
instead of being simply outraged denial and
comforting rationalization.

Refusing to accept that one has lost a discussion
is not the same as having won it.

That's not to say that Bizbee hasn't knocked quite
a few out of the park against various trollers and 
idiots (I've even complimented him on some of his
successes), but it's wildly overstating the case
for him to claim that he has never once been bested,
because he has.
