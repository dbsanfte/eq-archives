I've vendored about 12 copies of that stupid spell.
I've loaded it on goblin warriors in Misty at least 5 times now.

Velious level 55+ druid spells are NOT rare.  Everytime we farm for
Myga, we get three or four copies of this useless train starting
spell.

Go and hunt the mobs that drop these spells, you'll realize how common
these spells are.  Infact, I think we've vendored at least 20 or so
copies of PotG back when we farm the crap out of Lodizal.
