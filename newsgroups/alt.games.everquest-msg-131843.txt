Well, I was tanking better than the level 52 bard in my group, that's all I
meant.  Then again, I was tanking better than the cleric too, apparently I
had 400 hp more than him unbuffed while he had hero up, and 200 ac more (the
gimpy cleric).  If an add attacked him, he was half health before anyone
could say "add".
