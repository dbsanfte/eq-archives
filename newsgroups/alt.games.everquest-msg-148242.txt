Im trying the must have item for wizzies, staff of temperate flux
I have the staff of ro item by giving the guy the lambent stone, next i 
tried the skeletons in the tower off lake rathetear and they slaughtered 
me lvl 30, a beastlord level 30 and a mage level 25 group
I guess we need tanks too but i thought it would have been possible to 
do.
the 2 stone skels con dark blue to me and there earth pets light blue
With there being 4 mobs i wouldve thought i could quad kite these solo 
but it didnt work because i didnt realise how shit bonds of force is,
The mobs have to very very close together which they never are at first 
to get them so i can bof them
Try the 2aviaks in sk at the bottom of the aviak city and youll see what 
i mean, there like 5 feet apart and i cast bof, one of them didnt even 
bother assisting the other and wasnt at all affected by my bof
I thought the range of this was 20 feet?
Anyways other than trying to get a group of 35s with tanks to make sure 
of this, does anyone have any tactics i can use for securing the rod of 
bone i need for the quest.
I was thinking of using enstill as an opener on one of the stone skels 
then running away and trying to cast bof on the chasing group of 3 then 
aoe them to death, only problem is the lack of space to kite them well
i got resisted on bof when i was lvl 30, now im 32 it might stick

any tips anyone?
