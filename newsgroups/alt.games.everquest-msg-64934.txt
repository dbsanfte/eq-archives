    Heh, server-specific issue. On Quellious "Gnomercy" has become the
rallying cry for the Gnome Power types. Whenever a gnome zones into
someplace with other like-minded gnomes, you get a few shouted "GNOMERCY"s.
Has gone a bit quiet since the actual guild called Gnome Power went
belly-up, though.
