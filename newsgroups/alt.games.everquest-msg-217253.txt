That's about a success and a half in the 50's. ;)

Anyway, yeah, lots of people have been complaining about how harsh the
box traps are. ( On the up side, that's the openable boxes. The
interactive objects that you have to actually hit don't have nearly as
harsh dangers. Either a enchanter-style pet, heal, mana boost, or
spawns some mobs which are usually relatively weak -- average xp, but
they just slow you down since they don't count toward kill totals or
drop collection items ) Rumor is that they're tweaking the traps a bit
on Test.

They need to do 3 things with them:

1) Tone down the range on them. Dungeon-wide effects are plain stupid.
They need a little range, but currently, their reach is *WAY*
overdone.

2) Tone down the effects. A disease that takes several casts of the
best cure disease of the level the party was when they hit the trap
shouldn't do damage too fast for 3 casts on a single party member
before he dies. Biggest problem with this is the whole party dying
while the cleric is trying to cure the one.

3) Make it harder to trip the traps. Heck, I'd say to go as far as to
make them only trip if the box is opened without disarming first or
attacked.

Right now, the risk FAR outweighs the rewards. Box loot is pretty much
crap usually.
