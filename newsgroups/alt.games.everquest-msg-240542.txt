IC:

I have always noticed the hunters within my town preying on the fat city 
guards. Even after the trolls saught refuge within our stronghold, the 
hunters came to the Foreign quarter. I have never really minded nor 
interfered, and always found it easy to elude their grasp. And whenver a 
shieldmate taunted me that they were headed to Neriak to hunt, I always 
just smiled. Thin the herd of the fat and weak- I will mind it not. 
Those left among us will be stronger and more powerful, and you will 
tremble in fear when we cull the ranks of your hometown.
