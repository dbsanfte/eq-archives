Well... I've had my OS key for months now, but I've never had the chance 
to visit, as it doesn't seem to be a popular spot with my guild. So, the 
question is... How easy would it be for me to find a pickup group there? 
Also, is OS like CoM, where the good loot is distributed randomly among 
all the mobs? Do I stand a chance to make any significant loot if I try 
to solo near the zone-in?

Thanks.
