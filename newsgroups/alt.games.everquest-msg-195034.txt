Yes, there -is- something to what you say, most of the people that say they are
female seem to have large soft spots on the front of their upper bodies.  LARGE
soft spots in most cases.

Ledgend has it that the original plan was to make humans (clearly the weakest
race from stats, with no night vision, no regen, no innate foraging or AC or
other abilities) have an exp bonus to compensate.  For some reason this was
coded into Halflings by accident instead, although they have better stats (for
some classes), IR, innate sneak and hide.  If this was unintentional, its hard
to say why it wasn't corrected long since, they've already shown that they are
more than happy to make radical changes similar to this one.

There would be much rejoicing among the hard headed who play humans despite the
"human penalty", and much gnashing of teeth among those who took halflings
despite perhaps preferring another race, because of the exp bonus.  Win Win.
