Get thee to Crystal Caverns. One of the only dungeons around that level
where you may have a fair chance of getting a pick-up group.

Are you in a guild? It might be time to join one, if not. At this level,
you'll want to start getting solid groups of people you can trust rather
than random pick-up idiots. Having a premade group will open up many
more zones to you that you'd simply never see alone.
