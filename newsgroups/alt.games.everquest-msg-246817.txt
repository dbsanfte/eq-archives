Hi,

By way of introduction .. I have played Everquest for five years.  In
that time I have enjoyed most of my EQ experiences but the game is
souring for me.

Your bad management decisions are detracting from my enjoyment of the
game. Let's just have a look at some of those over recent times.

Let's see ... introduce an expansion GoD which is super hard for even
some of the uber guilds then tone this down a bit with a patch (not far
enough). Oh and a new class Berserker which has no unique capabilities
and is thoroughly broken .. good one that.

Introduce a new expansion which promises even harder content and a new
lvl cap (70) .. oh great.  Let's not forget a new epic (SOE forgot that
most long term players forgot about epics when PoP came out). Oh and
DX9 of course.

If I were to predict how you will attempt to keep players I would
suggest you will do these:

1.  Do away with the flagging requirements for VT, VP and the Tier 2/3
PoP zones which still have them.

2.  Introduce more low/mid-lvl content This must be part of your intent
with the new expansion and the things we have seen already such as ZEM
hotspots.

3.  Lower the cost of the game.  Yes I know you will initially lose
money but something is better than nothing which you are fast heading
towards.

4.  Bring your customer service out of a third world country.

5.  Bring back in-game GMs and un-cripple the guide service (what
service they have no powers).

6.  Listen to the player base not only uber-guilds when doing your
forward planning.

7.  Stop alienating your player base by a lack of communication .. all
well and good while you are top of the heap but not so good when you
are losing people hand over fist.  Or is this why you have finally
introduced "customer service officers" on your dev boards?  What do
they do with all the lists they ask for btw?

8.  Oh and while you are at it un-cripple the classes you have
alienated from the high end game in GoD ... a good example here is the
Shaman class.

9.  And while we are on a roll let's also suggest that you fix all
graphics problems; and

10.  Sack your current management because they have failed miserably.

I know this is not a long list and by no means complete but it
certainly captures how you have managed to wreck a good game and gives
some suggestions about how you can fix it.

Will anything happen as a result of my letter to you.

Prolly not ... you never appear in this long standing newsgroup ... in
fact you almost never appear .. communication again.

regards

@ndrew
