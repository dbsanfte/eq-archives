Late last night skeletons of a type unknown for the Qeynos area were
running around, according to a friend that was there. I was on my way
to Freeport so no turning back to see for myself.  Snakes up the pants
in Greater Faydark. Something about missing a blubber belly, don't
worry he'll be back. I think I got that right and saw this a couple
places. Rodcet Nife as well.
