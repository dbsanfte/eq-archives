I din't mean to imply that you didn't know what you were talking about, 
just that there were probably more details to it.

Hmm, well without a list thats not very helpful, and its possible that 
whatever list she was using was wrong anyway.  But at least its not 
"only in LOY zone", which would be a pain because its hard to get people 
to go there, and 50+ mobs aren't the sort of thing I want to solo as a 
mage.  Well, not just yet anyway.

Aha, thats right, I'd forgotten. 52-15= 37*5= 185, just what I capped 
at.  So to max the skill forever will take 3 more levels, 15 more 
training points, probably 1000 more pp.  And at that, probably cheaper 
to get to 200 than any other skill, certainly far less time used.

Too bad it doesn't go to 250 and have a grandmaster item, I'd be happy 
to spend the 10k more on the skill if it was just click on the trainer!

Splendid
