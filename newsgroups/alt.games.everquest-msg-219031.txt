SHHHH!!!!! :) Was just there yesterday, and noticing that it was decent Exp
( 1 tick of AA in a 4 person group per kill ), but that the mobs seemed to
have less HP and hit for LOTS less than PoN yard trash. Was thinking this
could be quite a nice place to do a little stressless root-n-rot soloing for
my drood, and I certainly dont need the competition ;)
