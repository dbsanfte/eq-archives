Well, first step is to get hold of a group.  There's simply things you
cannot do by yourself.  If you insist on solo'ing, then you're going
to have to settle for catching lone stragglers.

With a group, you have quite a few options avaliable to you.  You can
have you druid or ranger harmony pull, you can have your Shadow Knight
or Monk or Necro Feign Death pull, you can have your enchanter mes the
additions, you can have your wizard or cleric root the camp before
pulling.

And get a bow.  There's really no reason not to, and a pally has
enough trouble trying to pull in the first place.
