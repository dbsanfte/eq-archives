Well, I thought I'd go ahead and bite the bullet and try my luck.

I downloaded Dx8.1 last night and installed it today.  I reinstalled my
video drivers (leaked 23.10 for my GeForce 2 MX400).  Next, I ran the TestEQ
for the dx8 file and then ran it for regular to get things back to normal.
Edited the eqclient.ini and I was set to go.

I gritted my teeth and pressed "Accept" ... first thing was the game
confirming my Video card (don't know if I might've clicked the Options by
accident) and, more importantly, *identifying* my card by name for the first
time ever.

Got into the game, all the way to the character.  Hmmm, things are smoother,
quicker.  I'm definitely noticing MUCH less choppiness / better framerates.
Swinging my mouse-look around looks like .. well ... like I'm looking around
rather than having a seizure of some sort.

The *only* glitch I've noticed so far (EC-NFP area) is the flames in the
firepots have a square patch around them, but chars can still be seen
through them.  I expect they'll fix that soon enough and I can certainly
accept the tradeoff with the improved framerates.

I just wish there were some way to actually SEE my framerate expressed in
numbers on the screen.
