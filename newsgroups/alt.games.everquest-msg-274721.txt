It's official - Clerics are better killers than Rogues.  Today she was

whereas my Scout was 50/50 to win a fight against a green >>
scarecrow.  And when she did win one, it was with a sliver of health

At lvl 14, my Cleric has an 2 AC buffs, 3 healing spells (one of them
a HoT that activates when struck) and 2 debuffs for making mobs wimpy.

She kicks ass, pure and simple - if I'd know how tough Clerics are,
I'd have had one as my main from the start.

And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
