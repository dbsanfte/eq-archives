I get it too with my Voodoo 3 card.  Clicking out of the persona and/or
merchant screen should get rid of it.  If not, hit the "i" button until it goes

I sent EQ tech support an e-mail but (no surprise) they gave me the run around.
 The address they sent me has done nothing for me so this Christmas I'm getting
luclin and if that doesn't fix it i'm sol.
