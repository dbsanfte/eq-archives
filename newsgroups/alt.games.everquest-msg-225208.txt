They drop an average of 15pp, and half of them have a FS weapon worth 
another 5pp, plus occaisional jewelry items from black pearls to jade 
rings worth as much as another 15pp.  It -seemed- like it was worth 
checking them.  Cleaning them up, on the other hand, well if I didn't it 
would rapidly become difficult to loot for cash, because I was killing 
roughly 15 giants within the 7 minute rot time... which body was it my 
pet killed while I was off finding the next target?

Piled up bodies also made it difficult to spot the various PH, which 
were running around in and amongst the bodies, and were dwarfed by them; 
I did have as many as 5 down at a time before bothering to loot them.

I didn't loot the lizards or basilisks or giant skeletons, I did loot 
the cyclops because they were in my way and did have an average of 2pp cash.

Since its Firiona Vie I can't have a mule there without having a second 
account, and I'm too RL cheap to have a second account just to hold my 
money.

Ideally, having a gate casting secondary with an OT hammer and 
sufficient faction to bank in OT seems like the solution, instead of 
gating to a bank, hammer out and gate back... this solution does require 
SOW, though, without SOW its possible to get so overloaded you can't move.

I was complaining about 1500pp loot, not 827pp loot; the two of us 
looted less than I've been lead to expect One person to get.

I wasn't having the shaman heal my pet every 3rd or 4th giant, on 
singles there was literally no need to ever heal him, with two I'd 
consider it lightly, with 3 I'd use Primal Remedy, only with 4 At Once 
would the shaman throw in a heal.

Trouble with the disposable pet plan is that the best pet I have is the 
MS II one, IF it casts its Fireelementalaura.  This supposedly averages 
one pet in 4, but I've gone as many as 10 between DSing pets.  The DS is 
substantial, on the order of 40, and cuts kill time dramatically, its 
easy to tell the difference between an non DS'd pet, one I've cast my DS 
on, and one that's doing its own DSing.  Plus, I get a lot of milage out 
of Burnout III and Expedience, but kill pet and I have to refresh those. 
  Admittedly since I've just pet cannied my way thru 4+ non DSing pets 
the mana isnt' an issue... but the time to both do chain canni and then 
cast the buffs again is, even when soloing.

With the shaman, pet can get AC buff, HP buff, STR buff, Regen (the 
single best thing the shaman can do for him) and SOW instead of mere 
expedience... now killing him means losing even more investment

Its not some random guy anyway, in fact the shaman is the reason I'm on 
that server, and certainly the reason I'm there in RM; farming cash for 
myself and exp for her simultaneously; the mobs are DB to her while 
green to me, she's getting normal exp per hour while we both get rich. 
I was just wondering if the reports are inflated or if 3kpp per hour 
really is possible, and perhaps either I need even more levels or some 
better technique to clear that kind of dough.

Splendid
