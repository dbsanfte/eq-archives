That is rather unfair, for example when my 30 dark elf was in there it
was simply looking around, it is after all a city zone with some
quests and npcs to talk to. It is very easy to simply turn around or
back up forgeting about that rather large hole and the fact that
although the lower level has that forcefield, the upper one does not. 

However, the fact that you can just /corpse (at least where I fell)
from a lower floor (or maybe even the upper one.. forget) means it was
easy to get my body back.
