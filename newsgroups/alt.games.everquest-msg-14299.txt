If you are trying to level and nothing more, this quest is very much
worth the effort. I myself have decided not to do this quest, because
when you level only by doing quests such as this, you don't go up in
level on some important skills. Namely your weapon skills if your a
melee class, and your spell skills if you are a caster. You will be
higher level, but your skills overall will be lower than someone who
went up levels by fighting it out. Plus, the people who fight it out
and sell the belts have all the plat that comes with it. It takes
longer to level this way, but overall I think you're better off.
