Greetings.  You all have been very helpful in my last question, and even
advised me to speak plain English when I play (which I have done to great
success), so I have a few more questions.

What are guilds?  How does one join one?  Are there level requirements?

Can I purchase all of the spells (I'm a halfling druid) that are my spell
level?  Will there be enough room in the spellbook in the later levels?
What does the meditate button in the spellbook do?  I think it helps
regenerate mana but I don't have the meditate skill (I will as soon as I
make level 8, I'm level 7 now.).

Not that I'm anywhere near level 30, but what are the pros and cons to
specializing in each, um, specialty?  (Abjure, Alteration, Conjuration,
Divination, Evocation)?

What are misty acorns used for?  (So far I've only managed to sell them to
other players for a tidy profit.)

Why are honeycombs so sought after?  (Again, I've sold them to other
players.)

Why am I the only person who fishes for my food?  It's the cheapest way to
get food  (4 copper per bait) and a way to make some nickel and dime money
for newbies (when you fish out a rusty dagger).

Why is spiderling silk so popular?  (Aside from being able to use it to make
silk threads and using them in recipes for containers...unless that's the
reason?)

What are the skill levels?
1-10 - Awful
11-20 Very Bad
21-30 Bad... (What next?  Do I have the numbers right?  How high does it
go?)

Thank you all for your input.
