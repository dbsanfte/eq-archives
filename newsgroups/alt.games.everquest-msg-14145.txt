Here is another informative guide on smithing..
http://www.sbchuzzah.com/Smithing-I.htm

And of course http://eqtraders.com  is also a very good source as well - of
particular note- the lists of vendors which sell supplies needed for your
smithing career as well as lists of Foraged items and drops (Pigments, Blood
etc...).

Good luck..
