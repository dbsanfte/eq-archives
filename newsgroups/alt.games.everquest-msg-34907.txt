The same race makes it harder.  My wife teams up her human magician with my
Barb shaman.  I got assistance going to qeynos as a newbie so we could play
together.  It's fun.  That's our only combo that doesn't include a druid.
We also have a half-elf druid (me)/human enchanter (her) combo and a
half-elf druid(her)/half-elf ranger (me) combo.  We just got her kunark.
She's leveling up an iksar necro to group with my level 8 iksar shaman.
Maybe that's an option.  I love Kunark.  Is there an xp bonus there?  I
level fast.

Now that I wrote that down it seems kinda codependant or something.  At
least that goes right with our evercrack addiction.  hehe  BUT, we are
having fun.
