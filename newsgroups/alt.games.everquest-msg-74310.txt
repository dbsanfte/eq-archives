The port spells "ring of ...." spells that you get at 19 allow you to
travel to other locations without having to bind there.  

You target yourself (not that it makes a difference) and then click on
the loaded ring spell you want to use.

In a few moments, you'll appear at the ring specified in the spell.
You'll certainly want to get to West Commons, and you may need a port
to get there.  It's where most of your Ring spells for level 19 are
sold.

Make sure to get to Surefall Glade as well.  You can buy the Ring of
Surefall Glade spell there, which is really convenient.  You'll get
additional Ring spells at 24 and again at 29.

At level 29, you'll also get Circle spells which allow you to teleport
a group of people to the locations for which you have spells.

Your Ring spells don't require a component.  Just a healthy chunk of
mana.
