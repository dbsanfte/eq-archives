What great advice!  I had been using Berserker, Rune, and Haste on my 
Animation, with slow and nukes on the monster, which works on everything 
around there *except* Urusula, who sent me to the zoneline with 
double-digit hit points (I have yet to see Fantoma).  I hadn't thought 
of using the skeletons there, figuring I'd just have to gain a couple of 
levels and try again.

I hadn't found these quests yet.  Thanks very much for the tip!

By the way, I've also started doing some of the hotzone watchmaker 
quests.  The rewards seem to pretty much always be upgrades to what I 
have at the appropriate level of the hotzone.

I'm also making some plans to get started on your bard and general 
twenty-thirty-something hybrid class goodies you spoke of in Blightfire. 
  As for the Katta instruments, I've been there a couple times with 
Okosar, but Fungus Grove is one scary zone.  Is that the best way to get 
there, or is there a safer way for lower levels to make it?

Anyway, Prelgor, you are very knowledgeable and if I could hire you as 
my personal "stylist", I would.  You've helped get my oddly-equipped 
crew back on track again, and I am very grateful.  If you're on Prexus, 
let me teach you some languages or something (do people still learn 
those these days?).

Take care and safe travels!
