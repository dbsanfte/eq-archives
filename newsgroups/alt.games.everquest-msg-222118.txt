Shoot - rangers can get a 14/21 axe with vengeance 2.  They're down
to 1k or less on Lanys.  I picked up a 16/25 HTH weapon, and a nearly
as nice piercer for a total of <3k for my BL.  Both looked to come
from LDoN based on the names.  I remember when Crescent blades of
Luclin ran 10k plus and were a hot item <sigh>  Also, the MM leggings
and a LDoN cape are inexpensive, high (for bazaar gear) ac and HP
for a BL.
