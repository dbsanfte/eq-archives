It's not a matter of why France is afraid of their ethnic Moslems.
It's a matter of historical fact.

Go back upthread. I think I make a number of compelling cases why
Saddam with nukes + a whole passel of Middle Easter dictators who know
that the UN and US don't carry out their threats...scratch that. If
you need to go upthread to see that, I doubt I can convince you.

That's very cynical of you, David. The knee can jerk too far in the
other direction too, you know.

Please tell me you're being deliberately obtuse. Safely = without
getting whoever gathered the information killed. The people who
gathered the information are, by necessity, in Iraq.

And that comment about forged documents is just dirty pool, which I'm
sure you know. It was the US State Department that reported them
forged. They were not forged by us. They did not invalidate the case
made. And Iraq has already demonstrated their pernicity by firing SCUD
missiles, clearly forbidden by the UN resolutions.

I do admit that Iraq is a strange choice if you don't believe that
we're going after them for WoMD. I believe WoMD are a clear and
present danger. It doesn't seem far-fetched to me.

I'm not so naive as to believe everything the government tells me. But
I am not so cynical as to automatically disbelieve it either. Because
it seems reasonable to me to believe that Saddam is building WoMDs and
believe that our intelligence sources would be in danger if we
revealed the proof they gave us to demonstrate the WoMD programs. I do
think it's a trick the president should only try ONCE, though.

I don't think your interpretation is another way of looking at the
same thing I said. I think yours requires a tinfoil hat mentality and
doesn't hold up under the cut of Occam's Razor.

The US clearly tried to go through UN channels on this. We tried to
make the process work. We started that process back in October or
November.

But, joining the United Nations does not cause a nation to surrender
their soveriegnty. Members of the UN can still act outside of UN
purview if they see the need.

Now you believe the CIA? You can't have it both ways.

I didn't say NK wasn't a threat. I said they were not as serious or
immediate a threat. I stand by that assessment and do not see any real
challenges to it in yout perspective.

The opinions of a million buffoons are not worth that of one informed
man. World opinion doesn't interest me. Based on my own knowledge, I
see it as justified. So, I support it.
