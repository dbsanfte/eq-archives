All of the dialog boxes have a "handle" in the upper left corner of the box
itself...(it's a tiny square, hit pageup to disable tranparent polygons &
you'll be able to see it)

It works a little different than a standard windows box though, you don't
hold the mouse button down to drag...left-click the move block one time,
this enables drag mode...then move the box where you need it to be, and
click the move block again to disable dragging.  A little clunky, but it
works.


By the way, there's a similar block in the bottom right for resizing display
windows...similar operation, click, move mouse to resize, click again when
finished.
