True, there are improvements in areas. But there are also inevitable
effects of the code being constantly altered over a period of years
causing problems. The attempts to push the old engine's limits are
also going to create problems...

Besides, I'm sure Verant wasn't exactly given a big budget for
developement, so I doubt they had anything close to "best int he
business" coders working on the original code. So, yeah, it has
serious flaws because of that. At this point, it's not likely possible
to patch up all the holes without totally re-writing the game (Which
they're doing, ie: EQ2...).
