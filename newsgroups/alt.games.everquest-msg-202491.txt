It can't be trained and won't ever go up unless you're a class that
gets bash also. For races with Bash and slam, they can bash by hitting
their slam button and Bash will go up. It basically lets them bash
without equiping a shield. 

Slam does have an advantage in that it can stun an opponent and
interrupt spells, interrupting spells isn't something shaman do well
so it helps out some in that regard. Especially at the earlier levels
up to 30 or so. Somewhere in my 50s, that hotkey got deleted and it's
never been missed.
