Glad I could help.  =)  I meant to ask later if you guys got him but forgot.

Great accomplishment, btw.  One of my very first raids with my current guild
was HP, and I have the Shield of Ssraeshza from our farming of him.  In all
my subsequent Vex Thal farming and killing various PoP mobs up through the
elemental bosses, I have yet to find a better cleric shield.  FT6 and 45AC
and great stats are hard to beat.

So be sure to farm him as much as possible and get as many shields while you
can.

Oh, his other loot isn't bad either.  =)  I *just* replaced the Shroud of
Emerald Vines that he also drops.

Grats on the HP kill.  I'm honestly glad I had joined the channel and was
actually paying attention to the chat.  =)
