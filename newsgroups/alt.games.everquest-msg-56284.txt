This is a very amusing addition. I'm sorely tempted to try it out!

I take it SZ has a low player count?

Good thinking. TLC was probably the single most disliked thing ever
put into the game. The amazing thing was that it took many months, and
an online survey, for Verant to figure that out.

Heck, when I get done playing a random monster, I might just go visit
SM.

Let's see, the game has been out 2.5 years, and this is just getting
fixed. Hmmm. Why don't I believe that it's *really* fixed?

The light blue con is a nice addition, but I've always felt that *any*
exercise of my skills should result in *some* experience, even if it's
a minuscule amount. Or barring that, anything that might aggro on me,
including absurdly low greens, should give experience.

This sounds very much like fixing the wrong problem(s).

Have people still been occasionally going linkdead after picking up
stacks of coins from the ground? If so, is the right solution to not
allow coin dropping? Have people been scammed during trades because of
a bug involving trades near fire?  If so, is the right solution to not
allow coin dropping?

Hey, Verant, how about just get over your half-implemented anti-number
policy, and just show us the numbers for everything? You've never
wanted the game to be about the numbers, yet you show us some of them.
Pick a design philosophy and follow it, already!
