Except there was no sarcasm in your lamenting the fact that people did
not view the death of this child as a good thing. You said:

"Now since I wasn't a dumbass, I didn't manage to kill myself with
that toy. Sure enough, some other dumb child did. Rather than
celebrating
the removal of horribly flawed genes from the pool, they made the toy
nearly
impossible to kill yourself with. That was truly a sad day for
humanity."
 
Are you now going to say you were kidding? You used this incident as
supporting fact for your argument against stupidity. You weren't
kidding.

Nope. Children of the age that would be playing with a "See and Say"
type toy and risk serious injury or death from it couldn't possibly be
expected to know any better. Adults can be and should know better.
Also, to clarify, you were talking about adults irradiating
themselves, not being irradiated.

As I said, I have not tolerance for stupidity either. Stupidity, in
the typical conversational sense, could be defined as the misuse or
lack of use of possessed knowledge or wisdom. Children of that age
don't possess the knowledge to begin with. There is a huge difference.

Shocker.

Of course. Your own opinions go much farther in reflecting the level
of meaning your own life may have.
