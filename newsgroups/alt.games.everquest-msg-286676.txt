Really ? I got a ranger to 40th, with no guild help. I didn't even
find out temperance was for low level toons until I had played
almost a year. Didn't have the buff potions from the pok merchant
either.

When I bought the Evolution package deal, there was a book in it
that explained the interface, the background storry, etc.

As for the game, it isn't lal that hard to learn how to play.
Tactics took me a while, but I found a number of guides online on
tactics.
