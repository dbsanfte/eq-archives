My Enchanter just dinged 33, thought I would go to the bazaar to get a new
pair of shoes.I was still waring the Boots of the Collective Initiate. I did
find a pair for 150 pp. they person selling them was AFK
after awhile I get a tell from that him  . saying I was one luck b*****d,
then said he forgot to change the price for them.
the item was Loam Encrusted Lined Boots. I did feel some what bad about it.
but he did not raise a big stink about it . how much are they worth any way.
