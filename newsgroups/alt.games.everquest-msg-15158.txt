PC on Sarnak Ceremonial Dagger please.
I've heard it sell for as much as 1000pp.
Any other ideas?
Alakazahm lists it as 800pp but why is it so damn expensive? Its good
because it can go in a casters range weap slot.
Please someone verify?
How easy is it to sell and where is the best place to try and sell it?
