The Necro I mentioned isn't out 100% of the time. I can't remember his name,
but I'll try to get it for you.  He hangs out in the general area by the
statue where the river dumps into the lagoon.  I made the mistake of
thinking he was a PC (never heard of him up to that point) and ran right by
him.  Next thing I knew he was smacking me around with a few spells. I
didn't make it to the bridge.  I've had a few friends that have met
unfortunate ends while running past him too when he is out.

He's not a out all of the time, but trust me, he's there on occasion and he
seems to be a bit pissed for some reason.
