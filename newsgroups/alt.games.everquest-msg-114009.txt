 I could see that if it was an upper level guild that didn't have any
competition and could farm all the Trak teeth they needed. It's not like
the rest of the key quest is that difficult. With the exception of Verix
most everything else can be soloed. Getting an extra ST key probably not
that hard either for an upper level guild with no competition.

 Personally I'd just use the duel key-corpse method.
