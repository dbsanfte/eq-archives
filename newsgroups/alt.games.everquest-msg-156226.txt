      You should be able to teleport back just by walking over the
right spot -- I think it's the platform you mention, but I've honestly
not been there in several months.  You don't need to click or use
anything.

      If you've walked over everything obvious and you're still there,
then something is broken.  Use the /petition command to tell a guide
you're stuck so you can be warped out.
