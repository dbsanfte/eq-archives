    My reaction as well. I'd take a very dim view of this kind of behaviour.
As someone else pointed out, anyone amoral enough to do this to a stranger
would likely do things to guildmates, too.

    This isn't the first time I've heard of this happening. The problem is
the people doing the buying aren't familiar with the details of the quest,
so they don't know that what they're getting isn't what they need. They do a
search on "mold", see a "plate greaves mold" for 25 K, figure that nobody
would sell something for that much if it wasn't for that quest (the false
assumption), note how cheap it is, and rush to get it before someone else
nabs it out from under them. Shit, I was once halfway to a vendor with cash
in hand before I right-clicked and noticed that I was about to buy ornate
chain gauntlets, not an ornate chain gauntlet pattern, and I know the quest
very well.
