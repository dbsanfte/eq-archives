You may be on to something there.  Still, I'll note that an EXP death
is also a timesink (how do you regain that lost exp?).  In fact, unless
some spectacularly rare piece of loot rots on a corpse, all EQ penalties
boil down to timesinks (hmm, guess PoG and other one-way faction losses
don't, but they're outside the scope of death penalties).  But if going
to the graveyard was a voluntary choice that was an alternative to a
rez (i.e. going to the GY amounts to a self-only manaless corpse summon
that kills the rez timer on the corpse) thus fixing the unreasonably
high "lose all the gear that you took hundreds of hours to acquire"
risk and making a CR into a "quest for xp lost to death", I'd be a lot
less down on the whole idea.
