PATCH MESSAGE, SEPTEMBER 4, 2002

Experience Changes

- We have smoothed out level progression from 50-60. This should mitigate
the "penalty effect" that occurs in levels 51, 54 and 59. Note that it will
cost the same experience to level from 50 to 60 as it did before.

- Also, death experience loss will appear different in some levels. This is
an unfortunate side effect that must remain to prevent some experience
exploits.
