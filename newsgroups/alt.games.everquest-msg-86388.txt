Well, I am hearing that the cards won't actually be available until
March so I will have about three months to cry over my Ti500 and read
more benchmarks.

I do wish EQ had a better benchmarking utility.  Yesterday I was in
front of Felwithe and it started to rain.  For the first time I can
remember, the rain looked like rain, falling quickly and smoothly.  I
want that frame rate all the time!

If an extra 128 megs of video ram means higher framerates in denser
areas, I am all for it.
