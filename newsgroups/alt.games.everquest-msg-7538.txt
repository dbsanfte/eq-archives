I would disagree somewhat. People are not going to use the backpacks in their
bank, but the fact that packs at 3 stone are still lighter than the 4 stone kits,
and the 10% weight reduction, means that there will still be a lively demand for
"field work", as it were. Prices will no doubt come down, but that means perhaps
60pp rather than 80pp or 100pp.
