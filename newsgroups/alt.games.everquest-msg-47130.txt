I forget what the weapon I handed my pet was, it may have been
a leg chopper, anyway it was a 20 damage weapon, which meant
he was doing 40 points high end, double his normal damage, and of
course he ignored the high delay of the weapon, and kept swinging
at delay 30.   I know you need to be careful, some weapons can't
be weilded by some pets, I think the key is racial restriction; pet
can't use anything a human can't.
