I would assume a melee would have skills -- the melee would have to do
at least a point of damage before the mob died on the DS.  One would
reasonably assume the melee swung a weapon, kicked, and did anything
else possible to get that point of damage.  

Since lots of mobs would be swinging at the melee (some dieing to the
DS and giving no EXP because the melee did no damage), there would
have been lots of opportunities to learn dodge and gain defense skill.
Since the melee no longer has to put a point in taunt to gain skillups
in taunt, and the player doing the PL'r wants the mobs on the melee,
the melee should have been taunting continually.  

Offense may not be as good for a PL'd character as for a normal player
but when a normal melee is grouped with other melee his defense skill
might be lower than the PL'd character.  The normal guy may not be the
tank since another melee is better -- think ranger who groups often
with a paladin.  Kind of a wash if you ask me.
