I have just started a chanter and a lot of people have told me that
you can not solo.  I have soloed him from lvl 12 to 17, with no
problem, sure you can get faster exp in a group but no one told me
what fun you can have living on a knife edge with fear kiting and
charm soloing.  went from 14 to 16 charm soloing the bugs in pal cav's
great exp, shame about the cash.  but sure beats the booooring bit of
just sitting there handing out buffs, and sorting out adds, with a
strong group the chanter is much like a cleric, spending most of his
time sitting.  Some say that this is a chanters role, but soloing or
duoing with a necro or mele is so much fun.
