Well - my experience, and that of all but 2 of the 8 other 65 mages
in my guild, as well as many elemental+ mages on the tower, is 
different.

It is, however, a moot point.  The fix is in, my DPS *will* be reduced.

I feel they should refund SM1/2, QS1/2/3 and EP.  I bought all of these
(well, only QS1 so far) for the express purpose of canni-pet, as did many
other mages.  If they did this I'd immediately rebuy SM2.  However, EP
and QS are near useless except for canni-pet.  QS only effects summoning
things and CoH - and 9 second CoH's (with haste ring and cleric spell
haste) is more than fast enough.  I don't chain pet much - and if I
do I already had the timing down with just spell haste on.  As for
Elemental Pact - I only have one pet that takes malachite (water doesn't)
and, without canni, a couple of stacks of malachite lasts a week
or more..

After that it's just play for a while and see how my DPS compares to other
DPS classes I group with.  If I'm unhappy with it, I'll just switch mains
to my 58 BL.  If I focus on him instead of just goofing off, he'll be 65
in the next couple of weeks and probably have decent gear and his second
AA title by Feb.
