Oh give it a rest .... you and some others seem to insist on this ridiculous
convention in this particular newsgroup (I have not met another newsgroup
that is as rabid about this practice)... since you are not moderators just
killfile the top posters rather than seeming like the little boys you appear
to be.

When I posted almost a year ago a number of references on this matter about
top posting and the fact that it did adhere to "Netiquette" some of you were
reduced to vitriol and abuse. Just let the top posters alone or ignore them
if it offends your sensibilities.
