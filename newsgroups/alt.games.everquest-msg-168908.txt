You can order the servers by population, which serves much the same function.
You can't tell whether that "low population" server has 500 players or 500,000,
but you can see that it has more than any PVP server or the "pay more" server
Ledgends, and less than all the rest.

If server population is a serious issue for you, you could even go back several
times a day and see where servers move in the list as the day progresses, and
then on different days of the week to see how -that- affects population relative
to other servers.

Sadly, this prevents you just going ahead and playing.  What would be nice would
be if there was a web site that tracked that information so you could go in and
look for a server that tends to be low population during your playing times, or
something along those lines.

But IMO, it really doesn't matter all that much one way or the other.
