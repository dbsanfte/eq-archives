Different games have different beginnings and endings. You play to go
through the varied experience. There is no variety in DAoC, just endless
bland sameness.

They'll have it in DAoC...higher level characters who can kill you without
you ever seeing them, and no nearby bind stones so you have to run for an
hour to get back to where you were. Oooh, sounds like fun to me!

Yup, I sure do. Beta testing RvR in DAoC would imply that any previous
testing had been done. Since that is not the case, it will be in alpha
test. Unlike your normal alpha, there won't be all that many crash bugs to
discover, but that is about the only difference.
