I'm not sure, but if the item is an "Adventurer's Stone" or some such, yes
that's it. It is actually an augment that fits on an item that goes in your
charm slot, so you have to get a charm first.  The easiest charms to get for
many people are the charms you can buy with 6 or so adventure points that
add a few stat points when in LDoN adventures.
