I really like that.   The whole concentration angle
makes sense.  I'm not too sure of the buffs which don't
take concentration, however -- giving someone a SoW
doesn't take concentration, but disappears when not
grouped, for instance.  I'd rather see a 1/4 concentation
cost for it -- to make it consistent.  (And to stop the
constant recasting.)   There's no reason why they
couldn't have put in smaller buffs that way IMO.   But,
as is, it's a "good thing" in general.

> I dislike the encounter locking personally,

I'm willing to put up with it simply to avoid the training
and KS nonsense that goes with it.  It too has flaws
but it's damn hard to train someone intentionally in
EQ2 -- and KS is just impossible, at least within
their definition of KS.   More than that, it stops the
ability to power-level.

Neither of which is impossible now -- you just can't
power-level by doing so while they fight.

While some seem to concentrate on the KS or
whatever, it seems what they REALLY focused
on was stopping power-leveling.  If you played
a druid up to 50 and decide you'd really rather
have a brawler, that's fine -- you just actually
have to *play* the brawler up in levels.   I
certainly power-leveled in EQ (nothing like
leveling a wizard with KEI and Aego and
mod rods from level 1 up...)   But I also know
that wizard wasn't anywhere near as good at
his class as he would have been without it...

> I am not thrilled with the tradeskill system.

Me either but I was never happy with the mindless
click-fest tradeskills were in EQ either.  This is a
bit better than that -- but needs tweaking to make
it workable.   Of course we're not really seeing
what it will be like yet either due to the tradeskill
society leveling, etc.
