Ever heard of a pep rally? How about a parade in honor of the home team's 
Super Bowl or World Series victory? Then there are the small town newspaper 
articles about the local kid getting accepted to Harvard. How about simply 
a t-shirt that says "Don't mess with Texas" or "Roll Tide"? 

Pride can certainly be exhibited publicly and is often preferrably done so. 
That doesn't make it a selfish endeavor. Why is this so hard for you to 
understand?
