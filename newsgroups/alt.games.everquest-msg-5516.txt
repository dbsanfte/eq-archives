If you're talking about "Journeyman's Boots" yes they exist.  The effect is
"Journeyman's Boots" which is a watered down SOW (approx. 1/2 SOW speed).
The speed of the boots increases as you level.  At 30th my ranger could
outrun a level 14 druid SOW (barely)  (note: This was before ranger SOW was
moved from 39 to 30)

Travelers boots I don't know about.  I've heard rumors that they're boots
with 1ac and 1 charge of SOW
