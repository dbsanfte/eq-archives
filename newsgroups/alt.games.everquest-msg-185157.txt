I used to have the very same problem. About one in three times I
logged in, after about 2 min, my connection bar would turn into a red
smudge. I could send a /tell to clear it up (even to a non existant
user), but it would come back in 1 or 2 min. If I lasted more than the
inital 2 min after login, my connection was almost always good for my
entire session.

Then I upgraded to Windows XP. The problem has not happened since. Its
been months and I've had a single LD in that time and not a single
instance of the connection bar turning into a red smudge.

To me, that says that the problem is NOT Sony's servers, NOT the
client software, but the drivers for my network adapter (I suppose it
could also be Windows IP stack stuff, but I doubt it). For others, it
could be modem drivers.

None of this, however, is relevent to the OP's original comment -
crashing to the desktop while in trader mode in the bazaar.

Since this does't happen to everyone, and everyone uses the same
client software, it is clearly not the client software alone. More
likely an interaction between the client software and each users
individual system.

Virtually nothing anyone could tell me would convince me that Sony is
consciously and intentionally booting cusotmers off line in an attempt
to save bandwidth. If you honestly believe that...well, there's really
no words to complete that thought. But you might wanna pick up one of
those tinfoil hats that Empty was refering to.
