This is going off on a tangent, but...  Camping is amazingly accepted in the
game, and is a matter of course, and I find it amazing that Verant likes to
pretend it doesn't exist.  Instead of trying to cram the masses into their
vision, they, in this case, need to modify their vision to include the culture.
It's time to recognize camps, if just enough to keep people from coming in and
taking them over like this.
