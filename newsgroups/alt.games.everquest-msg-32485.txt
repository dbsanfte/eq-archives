I thought I was more coordinated than this, but....

Decided that I would try an Iksar ShadowKnight last night.  But how do you
get over to the platform where Arch Duke Xog is??  I have tried running up
that ladder and jumping across from every angle I can think of.  Am I
missing something very basic????


Thanks for your assistance!
