You can get a version of the game with all but the latest expansion for 
usually on the order of $30 or $40 I think.  Not sure off hand what it's 
called, but look for one that includes Ruins of Kunark, Scars of Velious, 
erm, uh, Something of Luclin, Planes of Power, Lost Dungeons of Norrath, 
Gates of Discord, Legacy of Ykesha, Omens of War.  You can also then 
pickup the latest expansion, Dragons of Norrath seperately.

The game is playable only online, and there is a monthly fee that just 
went up, or is going up shortly, to $13.95 I think.  I would suggest 
playing the first 30 days, which you get free (you will still need a 
credit card or game card to register, but, you can cancel your 
subscription immediately if using a credit card, and you will not be 
charged).  If you decide you will be playing long term, then go for one 
of the longer term subscriptions, 3, 6, or 12 months, and save a fair 
amount over the monthly cost.

There is also EQ2 which is generally easier to learn, and easier to play 
for short periods, if that suits your playstyles more.  It is also easy 
to solo any class in EQ2, whereas in EQ1 you will need to pick one of the 
solo classes (druid, wizard, bard, shaman, necromancer (probably missed 
one or two)).  If you will primarilly be playing with your wife, I highly 
recomend that one of you play a tanking type class (warrior, 
shadowknight, paladin), and the other a healing class (cleric, druid, 
shaman).  There are other combinations that can work as well.
