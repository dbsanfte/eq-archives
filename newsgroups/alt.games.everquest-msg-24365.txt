What I would really like to see is some kind of Animal-only Mesmerize
for Druids, with the hate-list wipe effect. I had someone die at my feet
in North Karana, eaten by wolves, because I'll be arsed if I'm going to

take each heal I put on him as a sign to keep fighting, rather than
heeding my advice of running like hell for the zone.
