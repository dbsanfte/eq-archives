Huh?
Last time I made the mistake of running the wrong way after I zoned
in, I zoned right out.

The only Velious zone I can think or which is one way is PoG and ToV.

Wouldn't freaking know about PoM since you need to kill like 8
freaking dragons in ToV North to even reach the freaking zone in
barring gimping your way over there.
