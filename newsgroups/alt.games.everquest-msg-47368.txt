Wrong again. I've never changed my position on the game. I've consistently
maintained my enthusiasm for it, I still do. I left because Funcom started
taking the fun out of my experience and I saw my investment going downhill
in their hands. I came to that conclusion after giving them some time to
self-correct for initial problems instead of getting my panties all bunched
up and advocating lawsuits like you did the first few days after the launch.


That's the difference between a reasoned approach and your approach. Your
first reaction is always to panic and run around proclaiming that the sky is
falling and that the only solution is to either file a billion dollar class
action lawsuit against the bastards who denied you your fun, or else round
up your family and stick them in a bomb shelter with gas masks until the bad
guys go away. Either way, you then cross-post to sixteen newsgroups a
provocative message and then sit at the keyboard for hours waiting for the
replies to come in and then respond to each one in record time. And then,
after you've had your fun slinging insults and calling people names, you
attempt to kiss and make up with a left-handed apology that you believe
makes everything Ok. It's your standard MO.



It's behaviors like this that have prompted so many people over the years to
suggest that you get a life (at which point you unfailingly drag in your 3
children, wife, 10,000 computer games and untold amounts of disposable
income as evidence that you in fact have one), and which cause people to
respond as they have to this thread. If you ever stop to relax, and stop
generating so much negativity in the name of saving us from ourselves,
people might actually have a reasonable dialog with you. Until then, this
thread epitomizes the kind of relationship you can expect to have with the
Usenet community (and, I suspect, others in your life).


As for making things "personal", I guess the things you say about me are
simply objective facts and not in any way meant personally, eh? ;-) I
honestly don't know why I continue to discuss anything with you; you're
utterly, completely hopeless. Go ahead and have the last word in reply, I
won�t be reading it anyway. I�m checking out of this thread in every one of
the *GAMING* newsgroups that you posted it to. Seeya! ;-)
