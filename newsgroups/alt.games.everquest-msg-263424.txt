I'd go farther, and say crafting in MMORPGs should be something that happens
automatically, when you are logged off.  Basically, when you camp in a city
or other area with tradeskill equipment, you should be able to designate a
certain amount of coin to spend, and a few hours real-time later, you should
have appropriate skill-ups in that tradeskill.  If you are trying to make
specific items, you select them when you camp, and the amount of money you
are willing to spend trying to make them, and you gather any special
ingrediants (no need to gather ordinary ingrediants...that's covered by the
money you designate).  When you log back in, you get the results.
