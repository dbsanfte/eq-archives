I love the old Ogre models, they are so goofy looking.  I keep them on now
that I started playing one, and Im just loving it.  I still do ogre speak
and made a bunch of emotes for em too.

/em picks a large booger from his nose ane flicks it on your shoe (or
another that flicks it on the ground depending on the person)
/em leans over and lets out a loud fart.
/em scratches his butt then smells his finger.
/em plops down on the ground with a loud *THUD*.

But personally I like the new Troll models, they look pretty neat.
