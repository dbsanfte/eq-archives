The benchmarks I've seen demonstrated that the P4 was significantly
outperformed by the K7 in business tasks like spreadsheet crunches and
the like. The primary reason given for this was that the P4 was
optimized for multimedia and deoptimized for these traditional tasks.
For a gaming system, the P4 may well have an advantage, since we're
now entering the world that the P4 was built for.
