    The zone line isn't supposed to act as a cleric. It only does so as a
bandage measure to stop a bug that would otherwise kill the player when they
zone. The zone line is supposed to clear aggro. See the difference?

    It all goes to designer intent. It was intended that zoning clear aggro.
That's why people that fight right beside a zone line, and run out it if
things go south, aren't exploiting. The designers did not intend zoning to
heal the character and reduce downtime, however. It does only as a stopgap
measure for another problem, players dying at the other end because item HPs
may not be applied to HP total before death conditions are checked. So using
that "feature" is an exploit.

    Shadow Knights actually use this method to pull, by the way, although
without the zone line. Pull a bunch of mobs, Darkness on the one you want,
Feign. The rest path home, the snared one stands there. I think it's because
the reduction of speed on a snared mob is applied to the run speed, as an
aside. So if mob X walks at 5 feet/second, and runs at 10 feet/second, and
you apply a 60% snare, his movement rate will always be slowed by 6
feet/second and he's incapable of moving when he's in "walk mode". Anyways,
after the rest path home either the SK stands up and tags his own pull if
aggro is clear off the other mobs, or a tagger will bring the snared mob
into camp while the SK tries to clear his aggro.
