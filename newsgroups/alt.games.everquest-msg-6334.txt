That's what I assumed myself, about the princes in the nick Vs 
princess in the sig.  But then again I tend to address people by what 
they call themselves and don't really care what it means...generally 
giving preference to the name in the sig if its different from the 
posting nick.

As for Dan having issues... I don't know about THAT.  Its not like 
clarity is Miss TPs strong suit.
