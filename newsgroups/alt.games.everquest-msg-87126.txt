Your necro, at 23, can *EASILY* solo the gargoyles on haunted island in
Ocean of Tears. (I took my necro to 24 there, so you'll still get fair
xp as well.) You can do two at a time with good strategy. They
occasionally drop gargoyle eyes which stack, and sell to vendors for
around 180 plat per stack (depending on charisma.) I made a lot of money
there.
