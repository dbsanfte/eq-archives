Note however that he has at least 6 time god loot items as well as a
majority of elemental plane drops in his other slots, meaning he's in a
guild that's been farming time for at least 6 months, or less if he's
the highest playtime cleric in a bid points type guild. My point being,
while it doesn't matter eventually, some choices can hamper your
enjoyment for a period of time at least.

As an example, my high elf cleric went through a few month period of
time where his str was an extreme liability, if for no other reason that
it limited his ability to collect loot while experiencing. Later on it
took me considerably longer to max out stamina to take advantage of the
extra hitpoints gained from the natural durability aa skill, while a
friend who was a dwarf cleric had much less trouble. In retrospect, I
probably would have put as many points in stamina as I could and the
rest in wisdom if I played a high elf again. High wisdom items abound in
the high end raid environment.  Another benefit of dwarf clerics in the
high end game is the lack of need to have a shrink device and keep
stocked up on mana batteries. Not a huge deal at that level but still a
pain in the butt sometimes.

I think if I did a cleric again knowing what I do now, I'd probably pick
dark elf. While the stats aren't particularly impressive, having an item
that casts a snare, a spell otherwise unavailable for a cleric, can be
huge if you happen to be in a group with no snaring class or, as is more
typical, a snaring class who forgets to snare. If I could though, I'd
play an ogre cleric. While it's true that being immune to stun doesn't
stop you getting interrupted, it does reduce it by a significant amount.
Sadly ogres can't play clerics.
