I read an interview with some SOE EQ bigwig (possibly found via a
link posted here, don't recall) that contained a statement to that
efect.  I can't recall the exact $$, some six-figure amount which
might have been a total over more than a calendar year.  IIRC, it
was mentioned as an example of how they were finding "revenue
opportunites" in EQ that nobody had predicted.

Just pointing out that if the James Hicks invented it then he also
managed to alter my memory as well, in which case I expect he'd
have much better things to do than argue trivia here.
