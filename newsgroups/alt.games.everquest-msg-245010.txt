}I heard a cautionary tale once, concerning boats, wherein there were a

}killed the fugitive, but at some time during the fight the boat had
}set sail, and much chaos was caused by the still-irate Cyclops who had
}decided to slaughter everyone on the boat.  Some players fought, some
}jumped off the boat, but the carnage was terrible.
}No idea if it is a true story, but it always had me looking over my
}shoulder for a Cyclops during the times boats worked  :D

That actually did happen to me a couple times. :)  Once, it was someone 
dashing aboard.  Another time, as the boat approached the Sister Isle 
dock, I happened to be looking ahead and saw Quag Maelstrom standing in 
the water at the end of the pier.  "Utoh", I thought to myself, and 
ditched over the side so I could gate. :)

The real problem with this scenario is, if you died on a boat, your corpse 
would go somewhere more or less random at the bottom of the sea when the 
boat zoned.  Luckily, this was considered a 'bug', so if you petitioned 
and were patient, a GM would eventually retrieve your corpse.
