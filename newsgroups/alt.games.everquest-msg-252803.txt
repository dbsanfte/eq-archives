This is probably worth doing for a player interested in questing his 
gear. This stuff can be done in a few weeks or less, depending on your 
level.


  There are the

Word has it the drops for these ... well... almost never do. You'd spend 
several months on them, and they're only a marginal upgrade over your 
Ivy Etched.

Thurgadin/Skyshrine/Kael. Velious has 3 factions and a different armour 
for each.

Are these still worth doing? Anyone? When Velious was endgame, taking 
several months to hunt the various zones was all there was to do so it 
wasn't a waste of time... now it seems effort vs reward is again 
ridiculous. By the time you can 1 group these drops, you can 1 group 
better stuff, and get it faster.

I would guess LDoN is probably a better route for most players, post 
ivy-etched.

(All this assumes you want to avoid shopping in the bazaar for all your 
gear, which, in my opinion sucks the life out of the game, especially at 
the low-midlevels.)
