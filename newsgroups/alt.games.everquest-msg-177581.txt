I was having a problem running a new character. Every time I loaded the
character the program would crash to desktop.  I tried deleting his
character INI file and it would then allow me to load him, but as soon as he
zoned, he would crash again. I gave up on finding an answer and figured that
one of these days I'd call customer abuse and see if there were any
suggestions.

But lo and behold, last night zoning problem gave me the clue and also put
me into detective mode.  I fixed my zoning problem and I was determined to
fix Fleea.  Instead of deleting his INI file I decided to take a look
instead and WOW! was it ever messed up.  I don't know how, or why, because
it was a brand new file, but it was totally screwed up.  His melee skill and
other skill buttons had really long numbers associated with them and I guess
it was freaking out the program trying to deal with them.  I fixed his INI
file the way it should have been and TADA! Fleea Lives!
