In that case there is no reason why you should take my word for anything I 
could tell you, so feel free to believe what you will.

Perhaps not *wrong*, per se, but certainly out of place. I can almost 
picture the scene in a rowdy bar somewhere, full of sailors on shore leave:

"Golly-gosh darn it! Did you spill my intercoursing beverage? My word! Look 
at the chestal area on that lady-of-the-night! It surely is making me 
aroused, I declare. Goodness gracious, what is this poop? It tastes like 
urine! Waiter, what in the intercourse is this doodie-doo? I shall drink no 
more of it! You can insert it up your sphincter!"
