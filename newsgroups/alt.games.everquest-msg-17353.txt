While looking at the item Jazzmanian Devil posted, I looked at some of the
others. This one caught my eye.

Someone wrote: "Last night I was in HHP and I zoned with 10 hit points.
Ended up somewhere out in the zone in Kith Woods. Let me add that this was
at night. So of course I didn't leave long. Seems to me I should either die
in the zone or make it just on the otherside where it is safe. Plus I have
still noticed that buffs are being removed on zoning. Most of the time when
you have low hit points. The only other time is when my DE Cleric has
Halfings Illision on. That will drop ever time I zone (is this as
intended). Thank you and still wondering if anyone reads these."

Ester the Tester responds

Yes we read them

This happends if you die just as you hit the zone line. The server gives
you a 'second chance' but it strips your buffs. This IS a bug but the fix
would most likely break other things. We have decided that we are not going
to change it.
**********

This happened to me a few days ago. GASP! It is now officially a bug. Will
I get banned for using this as an exploit?
