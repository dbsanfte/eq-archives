First things first, let them know what you see as wrong.  You can be polite
about it but let them know in as nice a way as possible "Heal now" or "Nuke
now"  or "Snare now" or what not.  Some folks haven't been playing a long
time and could use some advise on how to play better.

If it turns out you have an exp spongue, tell them why and drop them.  You
can also warn others in the area about the person worrying about upsetting
an exp spongue vs having them leech off of other groups...  think of it as a
public service to warn them <grin>

I've run across both types.  Some are sensitive about being told how to
play, others are grateful.  One guy I grouped with was a decent warrior but
didn't know squat about how to play a druid (as he told me) so I taught him
how to run a druid in a group and then how to kite.  We've been friends ever
since and both our chars are now in their 50's (from our teens) and he plays
a good druid char.
