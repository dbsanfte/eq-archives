For a bard with invis song, I'd just go back via FG.  Twilight Sea->
Fungus Grove->Echo Caverns->Shadowhaven->Nexus->PoK.  For anyone without 
a relatively reliable invis, I'd say the other way is probably safer.  Of 
course, as a bard, he can selos the long way to seriously reduce the time 
it takes, might even be faster actually, not sure.
