I also seem to channel most of my CHeals even when being beaten on - at
least when it's a single MOB. (If it's multiples, I've probably ducked
and am spam healing myself.)

Possibly the horse helps... can't really measure the knockback, but
it's logical that you would get less knockback when sitting on a horse.

One way to get aggro that Lance missed: broken or dropped mezzes. I'm
busy CHealing the tank and healing the chanter; if the chanter gets
stunned and fails to get a mez off, sometimes I'll be the one with
aggro from another MOB when the mez drops. When I'm healing a chanter,
I generally regard this as a good thing. I'd rather they get a chance
to re-mez.

But usually when being beaten on I'll try to channel a CHeal that
was already on the way, but won't cast a new one. CHeal invests too
much time for that - if you blow it (by failing to channel) then
the tank may die.

Yes, the domain is sad, but effective. :-)
