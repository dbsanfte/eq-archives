Exactly my point.  How many times do you go through a zone and hear "Camp
Check" by some elitist idiot?  Do you petition them for camping a MOB and not
sharing?  Do you send them a tell and say "Hey, I want the next spawn or else
I'll report you".

I'll bet you were the tattletale in school and cried to the teacher when you
didn't get your way.  I'll bet you were the one who pouted like a little girl
when you didn't get your way.  Too bad you never grew up.    MORON
