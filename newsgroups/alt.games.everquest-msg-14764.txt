	Never get a resisted message, but it does not work on some clockwork 
gmones.  I have tried it on Gearheart many times in the fairy camp, never works 
on him.  Guess now its the sprite camp, heh.

	My favorite use for harm, having a druid cast it on a quest NPC so my 
lizard can hand in item, of course a camo is also needed.
