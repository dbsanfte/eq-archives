This is pretty sound advice I think. Blind is da shit in PvP. I didn't
know BST got that spell, it's one you should always have memed in PvP
situations. I play a shaman, and keep blind memed. I also wield a
journeymans walking stick, that procs tashania. I'm not sure if BST
can use journeyman's stick, but if you can, try to pick one up.
Tashania will always stick, and once your enemy's MR is debuffed, it
will be much easier to land blind.

I think your basic strat should be to kite meleeists, and to get in
the face of casters and pound them with hand to hand. If a caster is
rooting your pet, you might consider blinding them, then moving right
next to the caster, and summoning your pet. If you can summon your pet
close enough, it should be able to attack even though rooted. This
works better if you can root your enemy, do BST get a root spell?

Of course, there are the standard admonitions: get your resists up for
PvP. Get em as high as you can. Carry extra resist items you can swap
out for AC gear when fighting casters. Acquire weapons with useful
procs that you can swap in and out for different situations. A lot of
PvP comes down to making the right equipment choices.

Lastly, the classes are not perfectly balanced. Some classes have
serious advantages over other classes. The only way to counter this
reality is to make friends and PK with a group. The PK power of a
group is greater than the sum of it's parts because of class synergy.
