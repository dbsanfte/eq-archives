Convienient you forgot to include your statement numbered 1
in your original post.

Let's see:

>> 1)Arguably the worst solo ability in the game.

Seems like you were talking about solo ability to me.
Or does solo mean group in your native language.

Hell why stop there lets compare them to Necros and Shaman.
Then then their spells really suck.

I said they can solo just fine. I didn't say they could solo as well
as druids or other good solo classes.

LOL You gotta be fucking kidding me.
Truncheon of Doom and a Fungi? Oh yeah those fall of trees
in misty thicket I forgot.

Let's outfit the cleric with similar uber gear then.

Lets compare the down time and exp per hour. Its a hell
of a lot faster to med back a full bar of Cleric mana than
it is to sit on your ass as a warrior or rogue waiting for
your hit points to come back.

Every class 'can' solo to some extent or another.
But Clerics being the 'worst'? Don't buy it.
