Hmm, gonna be interesting to see the following:

Does my druid epic still land on myself when casting on a mob once in a 
while?
Do the GD Book work during 10th ring/can bst summon pets in posky/one 
more i forgot, that they promised in TWO patches ago, then found out 
they missed and promised to put in the last patch?

Will the Bazaar LD issues be fixed? Going LD once a week while playing, 
1-3 times a night in bazaar on my mule (while i sleep, so no bandwith 
hogging from anything else).

Will Bazaar be more stable, been crashing at least once a day the last 
week on Veeshan
