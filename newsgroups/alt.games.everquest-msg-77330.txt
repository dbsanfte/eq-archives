I just came from Lake Ratherear, I did what you said to do.
I jumped in the boat by the barbarian fishing village and merchants,  south
of the areana. Did what you said, the boat would turn left and right but not
go forward or back. Are the boats broke or am I missing something?

Thank you for your assistants
