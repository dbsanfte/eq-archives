i think i have a way of lessening the chances of this happening to me
it hardly happens to me now...at least to the computer with out the memory
problem.
first i try to play on a computer with out a bunch of other programs loaded
onto it and then i try to close ALL programs...do [control] ,[alt],
[delete]and close all programs that are unneccessary before playing the
game.... i even get rid of "systray' and everything on it  oh!, and i get
rid of everything in my startup folder...except for EQ:)
