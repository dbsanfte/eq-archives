And as long as you don't try to pin this issue on men in black
helicopters we'll be laughing with you.  If you really want to know what
the problem is and what you can do about it until VI resolves the issue
please send 1 doz chocolate frosted chocolate cake donuts to my office
and I will explain to you what is really happening and a neat trick you
can use to prevent being dropped when the issue comes up.  The only time
this baby gets  me is if it strikes when I am zoning or I'm not paying
attention.  For faster service send good coffee as well!
