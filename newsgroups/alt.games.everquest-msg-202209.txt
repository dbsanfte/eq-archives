They weren't meant to be Tanks. They certainly were never meant to be a
better choice of Tank over plate classes. Whether this was because Monks
were too powerful or Tanks (Warriors and Knights) too weak is open to
debate, Monks took a beating from the nerf bat.
They were meant to reverse the Nerfing to some degree (not sure how much -
best ask Martin) but they are not back to the level they were.
