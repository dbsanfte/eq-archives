Fletching (the skill is also used for making bows) is very easy to
do at low levels.  The easiest Bow (Rough Hickory using the cheapest
string) "trivials" at 16 skill (roughly 2/3 chance of success at that
skill), as do the easiest arrows.  In general, to improve Fletching
skill you make arrows.  The difficulty scales with the price of the
most expensive ingredient, so when making arrows for skill-ups use
the cheapest parts for all save the current "skill-up" part you're
using.  IIRC, the initial progression is:
all cheapest (5cp) parts, then
Medium Nocks, next
Parabolic Fletch, next
Small Nocks, next
Bone Shafts, & etc.
always progressing to the next part based on price.  Once your skill
is at 68+ you'll want to make Small/Parabolic/Wood/Field arrows for
regular use (1dmg 150rng) because they are by far the best bang for
the buck at low level.  Also, find a write-up on the Trueshot Bow
quest, you are of a level to get experience hunting the pieces you
need in Steamfont now, which is probably the most tedious part of
the quest.  Be warned, your chance of success on the final combine
will be minimal (5%) unless your Fletching skill is over 150 or so,
and raising Fletching above 104 starts getting expensive.  But since
you want to RP it you could try the quest a few times before you
give it up as a bad job, you might get lucky, some people do.  Oh,
and if you do that quest know that the NPC in East Freeport is an
irritating imposter who will rip you off, you need to find the guy
in West Freeport (you'll know what I'm talking about when you get to
that part of the quest).

If the Ranger's Glade is still out there it has always had good info
on Fletching, Ranger quests, and Ranger tactics and equipment.
(Search the web, or maybe somebody will post an URL.)


As for shopping for weapons, at your low level try to find stuff
very cheap (under 10pp), like the Luggald Dagger (a 5/20 magic
piercer) that you can often find for 5 to 7 pp as NPC vendors pay
less than 5pp for it and it is a common drop.
