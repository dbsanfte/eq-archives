If Jesus died and nobody had picked up his teaching and ran with it I'd 
still call him a Christian. The fact that the religion hadn't been 
organized and named when he inspired it doesn't bear on whether or not 
he believed in what they eventually nailed down as christianties 
fundamentals. And if the defining quality of christianity is that you 
beleive those fundamentals then by definition he'd be a christian.

What exactly does it matter whether or not the flake is 'right wing'. In 
fact, what bearing does his winged-ness have on his flakiness?
