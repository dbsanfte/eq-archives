Misty Picnics, Kaladim Constitutionals, Fuzzlecutter (autodrink
hotkey set up so I don't down all the Constitutionals), Seafood
Salad (autoeat hotkey set up so I don't eat the picnics)

Spyglass (goes in the fuzzlecutter slot if I face a dispeller)

Epic (yep, its a POS but its handy when I see dead people, so
I carry it along)

Righteousness, Cudgel... sadly both outdated by the 6pp spell,
but handy when I've forgotten to summon it... and I still hold
out hope for stunnable mobs making Righteousness a good choice.

Assorted resist gear... although I've STILL not observed there
being any need to wear the damn stuff.  Anyone?

Stacks of Peridot, a stack of Emeralds, a stack of Bat Wings, stack
of Pearls.  Fish scales?   Well I don't have patience with people who
still haven't bothered getting an EB item, so no.

Travellers Boots.  Hmm, really can't think why.  If it was JBoots
would be better than Spyglass for outdoors, but since its not
insta cast, its not really usefull, and I have Run 3 which is always
faster and never fades out.

Key to Seb, HS, and the SS key (to get there from CS).  Since
the most recent patches I've been nowhere but Skyfire till
I got epic.  Sad eh?  Well soon these will stop hogging valuable
loot space.

Faithstone of Brell Serelis.  Man do I wish this was Soulbound!
Better than my epic... although I've not been on a raid since
getting epic, maybe I'll appreciate it more when I don't have to
corral bards and mages and so forth to rez mass deaths.
