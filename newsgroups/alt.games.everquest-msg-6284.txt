Eh.  There's allways been a shortage of decent healers in the game.
And despite Shamans and Druids actually being more use to a group most
of the time, most groups I've seen yelling for healers have allways
wanted clerics first for some strange reason.  So you're probably
never going to have a hard time finding a group.

Ehh.. probably the least "fun" of the hybird classes, IMHO.  You're
not taunting as well as the other hybird classes, your'e not doing
nearly the damage of a warrior, and you're not half the healer as a
cleric.  Still, they're handy to have around.  Just dont' expect as
many group invites as you would playing a cleric.

Meat sheilds are usually in demand, and Ogre/troll are good choices..
just be aware of the bitch of a time you'll have getting into most
dungeons.

Sounds like Shaman might be up your alley.  Ever consider it?
