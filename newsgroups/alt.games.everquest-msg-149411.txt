It is unbelievable, unless he's piss-poor at it right now.

Nope.  Each successful PP attempt gets half of the target's cash
(single coin type), down to a minimum of 1 coin left.  The giant you
got 21 Plat off of had 42 Plat on him.  If you'd succeeded again,
you'd have gotten 10 Plat, then 5...  After that it would have started
in on the Gold, then the Silver, then the Copper.  The tipoff that a
Rogue's running amok is when the mobs start dropping 1 of each coin.

Rogues who do this are stupid.

When I'm trying PP in Rathe, I try until I get ONE success on a giant,
then I go find another giant.  Doesn't matter what I get, one success
and off to find a new target.  Why?  So I don't thin the pool for the
others who are actually killing the mobs.

If I group with people, I usually don't bother with PP.  If I ask,
then I follow the above rule; PP until I get one success on the mob,
then wait for the next mob.

The most fun I ever had with PP was with a gnoll group in HH.  The
group I was with had decided that they wanted every single gnoll that
popped, both sides of the ridge, and that nobody would be allowed to
take one half while we did the other half.  So, I started PPing the
gnolls and every few minutes giving the "acquired" cash to a Paladin
in the group that was waiting for my group to stop acting like
jackasses.

Did you tell the group that?  That you were going to use PP and not
loot?  Keep in mind that (theoretically) that means that you'll get
the majority of the cash loot off *every* mob.

I got stamped the same on occasion in HHK.  Problem is stupid Rogues.

Yes, you sometimes can tell.  I expect them to be discreet.  If I can
tell, they aren't being discreet.  Yes, I hesitate to group with
Rogues who over-use their skill.  Yes, I'm a Rogue.

You've missed the best fun in the world.  You're skilling up on
Greens.  Do what I do.  Level 34, out into GD, and start skilling up
on Yellows.  Do it right or say goodnight.  (And yes, you *can* get
stuff off the Yellow-to-you Frost Giants.)
