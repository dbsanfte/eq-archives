SpiderLING silk drops were nerfed when they added drops for newbie
quest armour on spiderlings,and its still not reverted back to the old
droprate.
Spider Silk drop rate from Craigs in EK was always the same all this
years.
Prices for spider silk dropped from 10p to 3p or so,because everyone
and their brother has much better gear now,which makes farming Craigs
in EK very easy.
Last I did 1/2 a year go I collected 600 silks in 90 minutes with a
(well equipped) 55 Ranger.

Tradeskill ingredients needed for higher level skills like
Acrylia,Velium and assorted pelts,hides and furs are still pretty
expensive,not much changed over the years.For example I sold a dozen
Velium hound Furs for 700p each not long ago.

Conclusion:you can still make a living with farming tradeskill stuff.
