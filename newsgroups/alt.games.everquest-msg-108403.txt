If you had gotten very far, you would have just been summoned anyway.  I've
died a good number of times from running into Vekis.  I had the presence of
mind to run to the bridge and the guards, but just I was rounding the ruins
and could see the end of the bridge, boom: "You have been summoned!" and
then his pet was on me too.  I don't normally live too long once I've run
into him.
