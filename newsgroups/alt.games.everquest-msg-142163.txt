I must object.  We are Holy Warriors.  Our mandate and calling is by our
diety.  We are called to study both the clerical arts, and the profession of
arms.  We _are_ clerics, simply of a different calling.  We have had nothing
diminished, and nothing supplimented.  The fact that we share a common line
of spells with Clerics shows that we have been trained by their wise-men, we
are steeped in their traditions, we have trained with them for as long as we
have existed.  The druids and shamen, while nobel in their own right, have
little to do with the line of clerics.  They have different ways and
methods, they have not only different callings, but different trainings.
Paladins have more in common with clerics because we are part of the
clerical order; they are not.
