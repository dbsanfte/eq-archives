If you've got a 55 cleric to buff and heal and the cleric DS stacks with the
fire pet's innate shield, there's no reason not to use the fire pet
pre-level 52 (when the fire pets turn into jokes).  I've never found the
earth pet the best pet for tanking.  I think that's a myth that's slowly
being dispelled.  The earth pet has the most hp's, but it also takes a lot
more damage because of its low agility.  If you don't need the root and
don't plan on taking up chaincasting (which doesn't make sense in your
situation), I don't think you'll get much use from the earth pet.  With the
cleric to assist, I'm guessing you'll be set with fire pets (except the
level 52 gimp) all the way up to level 53, when you might want to switch to
the Vocerate Air pet.

At lower levels, I found the water pet to be a much better tank, at higher
levels the air pet's agility and stuns make it the best tank.
