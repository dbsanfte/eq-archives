It doesn't matter *why* its dangerous... it just is. If its the diseased 
and dirty needles and the bad unregulated cutting chemicals that are 
doing all the damage so be it... its still a game of russian roulette.

Your preaching to the choir as far as legal drugs vis-a-vis illegal 
ones. But the illegal ones (chemical ones in particular) *are* 
self-destructive even if its not intrinsically the drug itself at fault.

You've taken it upon yourself to defend the wrong point. If you can find 
a safe, harmless, controlled, way to shoot heroine then its fine by me. 
I feel we have an obligation not to be self-destructive, I don't have 
any opinion on heroine or even heroine vis-a-vis alchohol, per se.

And no I don't beleive my smoking a couple smokes a year, drinking a 
couple cups of java a month, and downing a few beers/wines/cocktails a 
week is doing any measurable irreparable damage.

How is that a problem? If refuse to see the log in my eye while pointing 
at the speck in yours that's one thing, but I'm happy to acknowledge my 
flaws while I advocate a less flawed lifestyle.

One issue I haven't addressed is *why* i think its immoral to be 
self-destructive. Its not out of some obligation to God, as someone 
postulated elsewhere, but to myself.

I believe that a human life has value, and that its immoral to 
deliberately degrade or destroy it. This extends to my own life, and by 
extension I beleive that all individuals have a similiar responsibility 
to themselves. Moreover I think this is one of the most important tenets 
in which I beleive, as it weighs on me greatly when I contemplate things 
like the death penalty and assisted suicide.

Unlike a simple right-to-life against the imperitive not to kill these 
have the ideals of justice (criminals must be punished), compassion 
(people should not be forced to suffer), and other ideals forming part 
of the scenario, which can combine more convincingly to justify these 
acts than simple 'right-to-live' can justify an organ harvest.
