They dont look dead to me, although the eyes and mouths do look bad, its
funny, I see them do the same stuff to celebrity photos on SNL and MADTV.  I
think even Leno and Conan do it.  The bad singing doesn't bother me but hey,
to each his own.  While I dont want to run out and buy Quizno's the
commercial is memorable because it is bad, they want people to remember
their ad do they not?

That's all i have to say
