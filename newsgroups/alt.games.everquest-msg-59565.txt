Running through EC tunnel to NRo on Tholuxe, Sunday evening (EST), I came
across what looked like three torches that had been ripped from the wall.
They were upright and evenly spread out across the width of the tunnel.

Puzzled, I targeted them and each one showed up in the target window as
'Khleth's corpse'.

I couldn't loot them (You cannot loot this corpse at this time.) and nobody
seemed to know what they were. Anyone have any idea what they could have
been?

Regards,
