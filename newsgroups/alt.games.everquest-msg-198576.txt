*Exactly.*   Now try to figure out why this invalidates your argument....

All relationships have vulnerabilities.   PoP (via the trials, the level
increase,
and the reduction in XP range) exploits those vulnerabilities.  A player who
was a good fit in a guild one day suddenly becomes a bad fit the next day.
Guilds (and players) *try* to overcome it.  Some do, because they're
closer to the upper-tier (a 'raiding' guild or a 'level-driven' player.)
Plenty
don't, because they're not.

PoP introduced a new schism for guilds to face.   Before, there was a change
from a "grouping" guild to a "raiding" guild.    Lots of guilds don't make
that
cut when players hit a level when raiding (and levels) becomes important.
There
was a change from an average "raiding" guild to a "ToV" guild (because of
the level
55 resists issue.)   Lots of guilds didn't make that cut because some
players
simply don't level well through the 50s.  A 'ToV" guild to a "NToV" (or
whatever you want to call "serious" raiding) guilds.  Lots of guilds don't
make
that cut because the majority of their members aren't interested in that
type
of time investment.    Now there's the "Tier 2" planes split.   And plenty
of
guilds don't make that cut either.

It's NOT that people WERE in the wrong guild.  It's that the rules of the
game
changed, introducing another hurdle for guilds.   And that rule change means
some guilds will fail to cross that hurdle, just as some guilds fail the
other
hurdles in the game.   A player WAS in the right guild;  now they're not.
Get it?
