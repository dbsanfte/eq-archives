OK, then you are in my op to sensitive.Primarlly because what I said was not
that offensive.

Beyond that, I will give you one more example: If we are in
alt.cancer.tobacco talking about the American Tobacco Company and you make
the statement "Chemist are scum" I will not take offense.  w/o expanding or
qualifying of your statement I know exactly who and what you are talking
about. You are not talking about chemist in anti cancer research, you are
not talking about chemist electroplating chrome on bumpers, you are talking
about chemist in the tobacco industry who do things like enhance the
addictive properties of tobacco. I would have to be a meglomaniac to think
you meant all chemist and specifically me.

Likewise if as we often see here, someone says halfling druids suck, I know
who they are most likely talking about vs myself and my character.

Any conversation defaults this way to the group you are discussing.  Beyond
explaining my position to you, I feel no obligation to modify my posting
style. You certainly have options available to you if you find my style
objectionable.
