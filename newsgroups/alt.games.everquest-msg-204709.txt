Hi all,

  I've taken some wierd aggro lately at some wierd times.  Once in PoJ,
there were just 3 of us near the exit.  Suddenly 2 rats came in and smoked
my bard quicker than you can say "smoked bard".  I barely even had a chance
to stand up because I didn't expect it since they are indifferent and gave
no warning.  Last night in PoJ the same thing happened except all of a
sudden there were like 6 types of mobs on me as we had just finished taking
out a rat.  Both times they only attacked me and not my group members.  This
has also happened to me in KC 3 times in the last few weeks.  Luckily I was
able to escape those 3 times.  Yes, I know KC has trains, but this was
different.  Twice was in LCY when waves and waves of mobs kept coming.
Wasn't a train because once we were the only ones in the zone and even the
hands and constructs made their way to LCY to render me into silly putty.
Other time was at the entrance.  We were deciding where to go as another
group was pulling entrance mobs when suddenly (after about 5 minutes of
sitting there with nothing happening) seemingly half the population of the
zone came screaming in and I made it out with barely any health.  Even the
other group bailed out and was /ooc'ing WTF DID YOU DO???  and stuff like
that.
Everytime I get questioned about using AE songs, which I haven't since level
2, running to the guards with chords still on.
Most of the time things are pretty same old-same old uneventful killing.
I'll take uneventful over CR's anyday, but in the meantime I can't figure
out what it is that's making me take odd aggro for no apparent reason...

Any ideas???

Sean...
