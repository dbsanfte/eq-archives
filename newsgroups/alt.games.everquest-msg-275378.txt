The thing I find most amusing is people in general at least on my server are
always complaining about nerfing or "dumbing down the game".  Yet when they
do something that is visually nice to look at and takes about 10 minutes to
learn, they complain it's too hard and /feedback and /ooc to no end.
Once you get the hang of it it's quite nice.
Think of it akin to street names, Red Dragon Portal being neighbourhood,
Diamond (for example) being your street name.
