No,

Protection of the Glades DRU/60
1: Increase AC by 24
2: Increase Max Hitpoints by 470 (L60) to 485 (L65)
3: Increase HP when cast by 470 (L60) to 485 (L65)
4: Increase Mana by 6 per tick
5: Stacking: Block new spell if slot 1 is effect 'AC' and < 1081
6: Stacking: Block new spell if slot 2 is effect 'Max Hitpoints' and < 2486

But then, SLN is only 2/tic

Skin like Nature RNG/59 DRU/49

5: Increase Hitpoints by 2 per tick

2: Increase AGI by 52
3: Increase DEX by 33
4: Increase ATK by 41

present).
