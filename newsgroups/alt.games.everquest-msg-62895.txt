I got lucky here, did it at 24, did need a heal from a friendly passing
druid, but i could get him almost dead, and would die from the creeping
crud every time. 
I killed him once, no cords, and died looting him heheh. I am sure some
day i will upgrade this, but i had someone offer me 500pp and Lizzy
mantle (yes i know that's a step down, but) and i turned them down.  Yes
i could have bought a new pair of cords with that 500, and had some
change plus the lizzie mantle to tide me over, but it just wouldn't have
the same satisfaction.

Another decent item is the netted kelp choker, which due to low int on
it, is actually only in the hundreds range rather than thousands, like
the rest.  AC3, 2int, 3wis and 3 str.
