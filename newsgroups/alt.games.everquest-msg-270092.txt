216 is based on what? Race x Class? Is every race a unique play 
experience? Seriously? In EQ1 that isn't remotely the case, at least 
beyond level 10.

Am I going to make a half-elf ranger, and find that a human ranger is a 
significantly different game that I might find suits my personality/play 
style better?
