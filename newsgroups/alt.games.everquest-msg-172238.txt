Yeah, that's pretty much correct. Female-female splicing is already 
possible, while male-male would obviously need a third-party egg, which 
would bring in its own mitochondrial DNA. I read an interesting article 
about it in New Scientist, but unfortunately their online archives are 
subscriber-only.

Personally, I can't wait. Reproduction hasn't changed fundamentally in a 
few million years, and it's high time for some alternatives to the 
current arrangements.
