Doesn't seem nearly as useful.

AE Cheal heals everyone it hits back up to full HP.  Big woop.  To kill
a boss target you have to heal one guy up to his full HP again and
again and again, keeping the rest of the raid from dying isn't really
so much the problem usually.  And keeping them from dying just once at
the cost of all your mana?  I'd be very underwhelmed.
