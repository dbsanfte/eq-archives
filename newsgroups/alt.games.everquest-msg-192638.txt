Whoever told you that was a fool. Yes, there are groups that will
bitch at a druid for not pretending to be a cleric, but those groups
are only hurting themselves. There are times where you will be the
only healer in the group, and therefore will be playing solely as a
healer. However, if there's a cleric in the group or someone else
designated as main healer, feel free to cast DS's, snares, nukes, and
DOTs. (Carefull with that last, and be sure the mob will stay alive
long enough for the DOT to do it's full run or at least most of it.)
Of course, do try to keep some mana in reserves for healing in
emergencies.

It happens a lot, but it's damn rude. You are free to chew out the
tanks for playing "loot before it hits the ground" style.

>Shoud I say something to the rest of the group about it??

Absolutely. And if they get bent out of shape over it, remember that
druids are one of the best solo classes in the game. Remind them of
that if you're the main healer. ;-)

Not always. There's a toggle setting to split coin or not when
looting. If you notice someone looting corpses of mobs that drop coin,
but never get a split, feel free to bonk him over the head and tell
him to turn on autosplit.
