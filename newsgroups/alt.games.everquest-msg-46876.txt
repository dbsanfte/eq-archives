20 sta*6= 120HP  at level 60 this is meaningful??

lets see now  

Ogr base Sta 132
Hum base sta 85
difference?

47 
200+47=247

Stat cap=255

255-247=8

8*6=48  thats not even one hit at 30.

Now, 20 points of agility at level 1 is approx 7 AC  7ac at level 1 is
more valuable than 7 hp?? YES?? NO??
