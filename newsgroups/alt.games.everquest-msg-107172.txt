hehe That is a canned response. Shall I follow with "No it isnt?"

What are they supposed to say? 
"Hello Ben, how can I help you?"
"Hello Ben, Can I help you?"

I sure would never instruct my people to say without greeting the
person first:
"Hello Ben, I am sorry you lost the bag with the Fungi Tunic, Lore
Centi Longsword and Stack of Blue Diamonds. We can't replace lost
items."
Guide: "Hello Ben, Your body was is lava and I have it at the zone
line"
Ben:"What Body?"

Those can all be canned as well. It's called a greeting. Just like
when I say "Good Morning" to the secretaries. It confirms that the
person you are talking with is ready to talk and exchange information.

Uh huh, when they say "Hello Ben, how can I help you?" that is
derserving of a bad rep?

Never had a problem with CS, and I use petition. I always get every
courtesy even when I am mad as anything. I don't always get the answer
I like, but thats the breaks.

CS is like that you have to say "Go to hell" and have people look
forward to the trip.
