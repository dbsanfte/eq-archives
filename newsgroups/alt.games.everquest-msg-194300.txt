I'm sure we will, like 11:00am your time, and with your Friday night RL 
"Events", I wouldn't expect you to be there =)  Then again, if we are able 
to do the CoH, it will knock a few hours off the raid and we may start 
later.

I'll give you good notice, though.  If we have a TRW, having you click us 
all after the corpses are summoned would be nice.  I don't see us wiping 
except in 3 possible places - the room after that trap, the room where the 
last raid wiped, and King's room.  We'll only have 2 Chanters if we stick 
with Guild people, so keeping that King room locked down won't be that 
easy.
