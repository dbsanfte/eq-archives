Did you try the usual stuff yet?  I'm not really an expert on this, but here are 
some possibilities:

Free up a bit more drive space, and defrag your drive.  If you really only have 
10Mb free that's certainly not enough.  It seems unlikely to me that EQ could 
even run with this little drive space and memory so I assume that's a typo.  I 
think I remember hearing that EQ likes 500Mb free on the drive it's running on.

Check to make sure you have the newest driver for your video card.

When you zone into a new zone, hit F10 to change screen res (make sure it's set 
to something other than 640x480), then hit it twice more to change back.  That 
made a world of difference for me in certain zones.

Try the UseUmbra=False line in EQclient.ini if you haven't tried it yet.  Do a 
google.com groups search to find it if you need to.
