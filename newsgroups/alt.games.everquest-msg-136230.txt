If the interest of the state was enhanced by same sex marriages there 
would be laws. However, that is not the case. The state has a direct 
interest in encouraging marriage between individuals who can reproduce.

Same sex marriages are simply a political statement intended to further
legitimize homosexuality as being ' normal ', offers no benefit to the 
state whatsoever, and would in fact reduce revenue.
