I love the SE basement - easiest place to solo that I've found &
decent exp (3 - 5% per kill).  The only drawback is only 6 mobs in the
room & not that quick at respawning.  Its a great place for anyone to
learn about charming with CoD though.

All the while armours have a reasonable chance to see invis so con all
of them.
Occasionally one of the humans can also see invis.  This tends to be
the Sentries more than others in my experience but still worth taking
an extra second to con them as your running through.

I've hunted quite a bit in there and both for soloing & grouping there
are lots of good spots, although certainly on Povar the basements and
the GY area are the only ones that seem to be camped on a regular
basis.  The other areas, I guess, are less popular due to the guards
that wander around through there & always turn up at inconvenient
moments!  Make nice pets though :)
