I'm not really sure how to phrase this so I guess I'll
just jump in.

I have a 47 enchanter.  I've been told that I should probably
wait until 48 / 49 to go to the planes.  My guild leader asked
me what my Intelligence was (240 w/ KEI) and then asked
how much HP I had (a little over 2000 w/ Ageo).
He said that when I upgrade equipment I should look for
HP,Mana,Stamina items.
I trust the opinions on this board way more that most people
in the game so I was wondering if you think that is a good
direction to take my equipment (HP/MN/STA) ?

Thanks
