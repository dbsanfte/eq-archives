Odd, I never killed a single trigger fish, and I got my ass eaten by sharks.
You really don't need extras around when you're being chewed on by 4 at
once.  Really.  Especially when that verdammt named one decided to add his 3
(rows of) teeth worth.

The only things I did kill to get more sharks were the barracuda thingies
(can't remember their names), and I didn't need to do that much.  Between
razortooths and sawtooths, I had more than sufficient sharks about 90% of
the time.
