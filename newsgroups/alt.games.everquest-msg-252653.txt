Yes, I actually think it is. VS is very much a raiding server, we have a very
low total player population but a high proportion of high end guilds. Well
equipped players (such as the ones in high end guilds) can easily get SPs
and rune words which means there are more high level spells around per
capita than other servers. Especially when it comes to rune words, which
drop from higher level mobs with long respawn times, these tend to drop at
close to the same rate as on other servers with fewer people needing them.

Also I get the impression that there aren't as many plat sellers on VS as
there are on other servers, so PP is worth more on VS.
