Sounds like you got caught in the mess they made of it when the 
resists changed.  I did all my Rak kills before that - so it may not
be possible to do it that way any more.

I haven't seen anything about it on the Magician's Tower for
a while - but there were many reports of 49 fire pets dying in
a hurry a while back.  This may have been deliberate on SOE's
part to make Rak less trivial (although the simple progression
of the game has done that just as well, just without mages)
