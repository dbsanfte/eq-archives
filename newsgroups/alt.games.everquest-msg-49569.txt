This is now false.  Kael armor pieces drop all over KD, not just in the
arena, and a necro could certainly hunt solo in KD if he sticks to the
easier mobs.  I see no reason why a dedicated hunter couldn't get
himself some thurgadin armor solo... and make a small fortune
multiquesting the three wrong sorts he picks up at the same time.
Mind you, it will take -forever- to get yourself a suit soloing, but it should
be exp and the faction hits are good too.
