Sorry I can't agree with this. It depends on the mob. For example, casters
should always be stunned. Better if someone else can do it perhaps, but if
they can't the little bit of mana you spend on a stun or even chain stuns is
more than made up for in what you have to spend healing damage from a nuke
or, gods forbid, a rez.

Also if the chanter or other caster is in real trouble stunning the mob on
them is almost always a good idea if it means keeping them alive.

When you're Fm then by all means nuke a little bit.

Even when you're not Fm sometimes if the group has lots of adds, you can
help a lot by nuking down that mob thats about to die so that the melee'ers
can move on to the next one. This takes judgement about your mana though.
