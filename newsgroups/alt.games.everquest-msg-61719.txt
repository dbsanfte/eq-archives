CL is a measurement of the number of clock cycles it takes before data
starts to flow once a command is received. The standard rating is CL3,
which is slightly slower than CL2. For most applications there is very
little difference in performance between CL2 and CL3 parts.

I have purchased online from Crucial several times in the past. They
have OUTSTANDING customer service! I highly recommend them.

IBM is horrible about that. Most of the internal components used by
IBM are proprietary, and impossible to upgrade through an outside
source.

I looked at IBM's Web site. The E-Pro 6867 shipped with the following
memory: Memory - 128 MB PC700 Memory RIMM, ECC 

A quick search of the net did not find anything hopeful. I fear IBM
has you over a barrel on this one. 

>Three: Applying to both of our systems, the video cards are listed as

It looks like the IBM box will only take a PCI video card. Look for a
cheap GeForce2 MX card in AGP for the Gateway and PCI for the IBM.

>But there are continual comments that 98SE will "blow up" if I upgrade my RAM above 128 or 256.

Win98/98SE works perfectly with up to 512mb of RAM. Once you exceed
512 problems can arise.

PCs are the sum of their parts. The most important part of any PC (and
the most often ignored) is the Motherboard. You can have the fastest
processor, the fastest RAM, the fastest video card, but if the
Motherboard is slow or a bottle-neck the system will run like a dog.
The MB is the "traffic cop" of the entire PC system. It controls how
fast and in what order all of the devices communicate with each other.
