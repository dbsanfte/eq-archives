LOL, I love this...grin.

CH is about the only thing I announce when I am casting it. I can't 
understand not being willing to pop a fast heal on the chanter, that is 
just plain stupid! I love grouping with chanters and bards because of 
the great CC possibilities. I have to admit, I like some oddball group 
combos, but I am thrilled when I can add a rogue, chanter or bard to my 
group=) I have a midlevel rogue alt, and a 18 chanter, and a 5 bardling 
so I can understand their grouping problems just a little=) and I try to 
make sure that when I put a group together I get as many people in that 
I have previously grouped with and know to be competent as I can.
