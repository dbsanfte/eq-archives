The point, which you keep attempting to dodge, is that the notion of
level-appropriateness is very much a part of AD&D.  Do not those very
modules you mention have recommended levels printed on their covers?
If your level 20 party bought a module which was recommended for
levels 1 to 3, would any DM allow you to play it unmodified?

And if a DM put a Defender +5 into that dungeon and let a level 1 to 3
party play it, we might shake our heads and call him a Monty Haul DM.
But if he put the sword there and then allowed a level 20 party to
play it, we'd call him crazy.

I've never heard anyone give that reason.  It doesn't make much sense,
in any case, there are loads of equivalent level places which aren't
level restricted.

Not really.  Although somewhere around 200 levels are possible I
believe, by the time you reach 60 or so you're high level and anything
after that is icing.  And the dungeons are often restricted to 1 to 10
or 10 to 25, etc.  This can be especially inconveniencing because of
AC's rather bizarre portaling system, which makes dungeons attractive
for reasons entirely unrelated to their content.

People cope, it's no big deal.

Your initial representation of these places made it sound as if
getting loot there were extremely difficult.  I recognize that as a
cleric you have additional expenses, but would you say the average
player in these zones would have a difficult time coming up with 800
pp for gator legs, if he were saving for that and not spending his
plat on other things?  From what I've heard from my friends, I
seriously doubt it.

So your reward for leveling up all those levels is to go and sit in
some boring dungeon all by yourself, killing green place holders hour
after hour until finally the green thing pops that has what you came
for?  This is why you played?

I should have thought the reward was the ability to go to the toughest
parts of the game, fighting gods and dragons with friends of long
acquaintance and at the end of a tough fight possibly get some neat
treasure.

You are hardly being penalized.  You get to interact with content
which the lower level player cannot.  You get to obtain items the
lower level player cannot.  You can cast spells he can't, which is one
of the primary motivations for leveling a caster, IME.

Do the mobs get tougher relative to you?  Sure.  It was presumed
originally that the level 50 would have a better notion how to play
than the level 1 (perhaps a questionable assumption in today's EQ).
