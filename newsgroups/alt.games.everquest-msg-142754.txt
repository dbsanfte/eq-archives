I also noticed that you confused "... that they are endowed by their
Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life,
Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." from the Declaration of
Independence with the first 10 amendments to the Constitution (the
Bill of Rights) written more than 10 years later.  If these documents
are so important to you then perhaps you ought to take your own
advice and read them.  While you're at it, for extra credit you can
study the actual meaning of non-exclusive phrasings like "among these".
Extra credit part two:  explain to the class the difference between
clearly identifying a belief (or opinion) as such (example: "We hold
these truths to be self-evident..." from the Declaration), and
asserting a belief (or opinion) as if it were fact (example:  "Well
ours where(sic) defined as the inalienale(sic) rights provided by god"
from your post).
