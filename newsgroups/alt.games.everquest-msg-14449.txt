This was worth a look because, in my opinion, it shows the GM's to be
remarkably reasonable and tolerant folk. Even after all the mayhem,
foul language, racial slurs etc. the GM was still advising him to cool
off and just cancel the account and that way he could come back again
if he wanted to. An amazing degree of tolerance and self control,
IMHO, far more than I would have shown given the circumstances and the
obvious mind set of the individual concerned.
