Aye.. pretty good general breakdown Some things i might point out..
you lean heavy on CC at the start, especially if we're talking 65's
across the board.. even somewhat elementally equipped. When you get
there you can compensate with high damage to negate some of the CC
issues. At the same time you can also go pet classes to provide
offtanking. Beastlord and necro combo is a great one. And a beastlord
is really two extra tanks.. himself and pet. Make sure the necro goes
warrior and not rogue pet for offtanking. Basically.. taking it from a
tank point of view and these are pretty specific to me... i went:

1. Get a slower. I don't care which.. just need a slower. Beastlord
preferred.
2. Get a healer. Druid or Cleric.
3. Get as much bloody damage as you can find. Rogues, preferably
higher level more the better, mages, wizards, necros(really great for
any ldon).

If i had to get an enchanter they had better know what they are doing,
keep up with what i do, and not be a glass caster(one hit and they
shatter). I would do stuff like transitions from mob A to mob B at
15%, even if that required running down 5 halls to get to it with the
previous mob on my tail and them following it. I loathed downtime, and
like everyone should have learned in DL.. the killing never stops.

Still.. my favorite group is Team Backstab. Warrior, Cleric, Bard, 3
rogues. You could smell the heat.

The thing I always went for was overkill.. that way the dungeon would
go by fast and if someone *HAD* to leave it didn't usually fail the
mission. If you try to get too conservative.. then the loss of one
player can break you.

But still.. good breakdown on your post.
