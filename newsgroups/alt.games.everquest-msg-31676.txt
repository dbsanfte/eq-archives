Wheel of Time series, Robert Jordan, I think.  That's where his whole name
comes from.  Quite petitionable I might add.  But then, IIRC he already
knows that, and isn't too worried about it.  Spelling is slightly changed I
think, been a while since I read the ones that are out so far.  I believe
it's Rand in the books.
