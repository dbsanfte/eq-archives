The Astral Projection on the top of the pillar in the lake will buy them for
50-60pp if you are churning through BG's. I always do a "/w rogue" to look
for teens level rogues in the zone - they are much happier getting this weap
than I would be getting 50pp =).

Since Luclin, though, with all the Uber Rogue Piercers, the HoD is not worth
much anymore. 12/28 mining picks that weigh only 0.4 drop like candy in
Tenebrous off low 30 mobs. You can find them laying on the ground if groups
are farming Acrylia. They don't hit magic, but at only 0.4 carry the thing
around for the 90% of the MOBs you can hit.
