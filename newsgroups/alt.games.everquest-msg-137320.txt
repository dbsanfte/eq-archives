Is it really such a big deal for the MA to be blind?   You know where your
hotkeys are.. people know you have agro to heal you etc.. and if you did
die, blind would obviously wear off

The gating mobs in TiV's room are an absolute pain.. its a mob where
everybody needs to be focused from the time you move to the fallen pillar,
wheras on most fights you just need to focus when the boss mob is inc.

As for the add's... hehe no matter what, *somebody* is guaranteed to agro
them!  We had some random_druid_01 tag along uninvited on a recent TiV
killing.. with names off and stuff, she didn't really get noticed.   Until
half way through the fight she decides to run to the wall, then run back to
us, agroing the entire side.  They are on a really fast timer, so its not
just 1 add you get either
