I have noticed something similar that might be the same thing.  I am a bard
so I have my inventory slots hotkeyed and am constantly picking instruments
up from one slot and swapping with another.  I notice that sometimes it
picks up from the wrong slot.  It doesnt visibly overshoot or undershoot but
it does not click where I expected.  I think there is a bit of video lag.  I
am also using a geo2 so that might be it.
