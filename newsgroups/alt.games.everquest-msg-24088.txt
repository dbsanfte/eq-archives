A third party program, that allows you to view information not normally
available in game, such as which monsters are spawned and where.   I'm not
sure what else it can do, I've never used it and it's been a while since it
was last discussed here.

Just to note, using this program is against the ELUA, and Verant will ban you
for it if they catch you using it.
