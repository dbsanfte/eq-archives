Because post-60 raiding's what the game is pointed towards. You'll run
out of AA before you run out of mobs worth killing.

...and how would giving them a slightly more important role (without
encroaching on other classes) be a 'Bad Thing' <tm> ?

Now you're being ridiculous. Mages are 100% needed for high level
fights. Most endgame content is unbeatable initially without a decent
mage turnout.

If you haven't established how useful necros are on 95% of raid level
mobs, either you're blind, or the necros you know are stupid.

Brells and prexus are enough of a reason in themselves, but throw in
LoH, strong backup healing whilst being able survive any agro generated,
plus reasonable melee, and awesome melee against the few undeads.
