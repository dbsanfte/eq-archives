	I think poor Chorkie may have been suffering from Brown Belt
Syndrome... :-) :-)  (That's a state that comes about when you master
something enough so that you're pretty good at it but not enough so
that you realize how much you still need to learn).  But ya know?
That happens to a lot of people, not because they're jerks, but because
it's an artifact of the way humans percieve the world.  If you're mean
to the brown belts and laugh at them you never get any more BLACK belts
and soon there's no one to play with...

	I'm not trying to address whether Chorkie could have been more
delicate, or if she's a good cleric, or if I'd group with her.  All I'm
trying to say is that IMHO we need to explicitly try and maintain a
positive and helpful atmosphere even to annoying brown belts because
our goal should be to cultivate more black belts, Norrathian and Usenetian :-)

	It's especially easy to be mean online even if you don't mean ;-)
to be. So it needs extra attention...
