Beyond which, do development costs mysteriously dissapear because you've
been playing since the start? It costs money to make a game. It costs
money to make an expansion. It costs money to maintain servers,
bandwidth, web pages, and so on. Frankly, and I grant I have only been
playing 2 months, I don't think it's that unreasonable. 

Also, they do bundles every few expansions, it seems. So you can get
trilogy cheap now, and next month, they have one with all the expansions
up to LoY. Seems like a sane deal to me.
