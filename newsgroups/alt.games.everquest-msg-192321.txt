After months of playing i have never had a problem with crashing to
desktop... Now after the patch it happens everytime i log in.  even
reinstalled the entire OS (don't start and yes i backed up  120 gigs of info
on cd's) Either it is a glitch or EQ is not compatable with RAID striping.
Here is my system specs.... Oh btw i set up RAID Striping after the patch
and had the crash problem happen a few times before i went to RAID.

OS : Win XP Professional SP1
Processor : Intel P4 2.40 gHz  533FSB
Memory : 1024 megs 2700 DDR SDRAM (266)
Motherboard : Soyo P4x400 Dragon Ultra
Vid Card : 128 meg GeForce 4 Ti4200 8x AGP
Hard Drive(s) : 2 Maxtor 60 gig ATA 133 on RAID Striping (RAID 0)
Sound :  C-Media Generic 4Channel Audio
Network Card : Realtek built-in
CD Rom : LG  DVD-ROM\CD-RW

Any info would be appreciated.  I have no problem reformatting and getting
rid of raid (but hey scsi access times for an ide drive :-)  )
