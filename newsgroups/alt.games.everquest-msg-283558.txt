Right now, the claim system is only partially tied to an expansion, in 
fact... As I understand it, it's only tied to an expansion account key.

When we load your character in game, we just query your account to see 
if you have any pending /claim rewards, that's it. There is no reason 
for us to bother checking to see if you have the expansion before 
allowing you to /claim the reward because, up until now, there was no 
way for you to get an expansion account key before the expansion 
actually launched.

With this server, we're changing that dynamic a bit, since your account 
can have the expansion, but the server may not. The system has to be 
looked at to see what it's going to take to be able to fully tie a 
pending /claim reward to an expansion. This may be simple. This may 
prove to be difficult.

Best case, claim rewards will be fully tied to an expansion, allowing us 
to restrict them to only be claimed when that expansion is unlocked.

Worst case, we'll have to lock all claim rewards until a time where we 
feel they are not unbalanced (which hasn't been discussed because we're 
still looking at the viability of fully tying them to an expansion)."

By the way, the Sony forums are well worth keeping up with, especially 
the Progression server ones.
