I suspect he just can't understand how we can have fun when we're not
being optimally efficient or when we try to roleplay, so he just
ignores us when we say we do.

Astigmatism, yay! It's an added flavor to my myopia. With a clear
visual range that ends 4 inches from my eyes (yes, ends where
normal-sighted people's vision begins) and a touch of double vision,
places like swimming pools are fun.
There's a new eye laser surgery clinic in town. They claim to have the
most modern equipment in the country. Maybe I should check them out.
