It doesn't bother me in the slightest.  Then again, I don't make it a point
to get twinks in my lowbie groups (after all, most of my lowbies are
twinks...what else am I going to do with my cast-offs?).

What I always read it as meaning is "I've got good AC and a good
weapon...you won't have to worry about keeping me alive as much as some
people."  It's useless information, but harmless.

Now totally going off on a tangent... <g>

If *I* wanted to bitch about something it'd be people who continue to say
"PST." That's about as stupid as saying "Level 60 druid with SoW lfg."

"I mean, yeah, no shit, you're looking for a tell?  Whodathunkit!?!?!"
