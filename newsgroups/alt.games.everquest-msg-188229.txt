I've heard many people say that monks are solo-able and I can see that
especially as an Iskar, but doesn't the weight penalty force you to
either lose on looting or constantly make vendor runs?  Or is it
simply a matter of saving $$ for WR bags?

I'm still a little confused on the whole penalty system as well.  Is
it 14 lbs total or 14 lbs encumbered?  I've seen people talk both
ways.

Then again, as fun as a monk sounds, I'm not sure if I could ever get
used to no SOW or Gate.

Thank you all for your opinions, they really do help.
