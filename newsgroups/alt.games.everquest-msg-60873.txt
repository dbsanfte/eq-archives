Sadly I think it is the pull. when you start the world is an insanely
dangerous place. You no sooner run down Halas ramp or a Feydark lift
and there are things out there that can kill you in seconds. Even when
you get tougher you always have to keep on eye out.

"Orc Legionnaire, how tough could it be?"

"Why is that skeleton called a vengeful soloist?......."

"Those are big footsteps for an oasis croc...."

"Big, black, scythe....that's not a croc either."

But eventually you get to the point where things that once terrified
you are fun. Where you actively hunt down vengefuls, where you decide
that Martar icebear gets his and Fippy goes no further. Even when you
come in and rescue a team of newbies like a one man cavalry charge.
Where you know how the world works and can travel with some degree of
safety. And can go on to hunt more powerful foes :)

The first problem is that 7th level really isn't that high. Up until
10th you're really supposed to be hunting within your starting area.
And most elves, sensibly, graduate into crushbone (north) rather than
Lesser Faydark.

The second problem is that some characters solo and travel badly. And
a paladin scores pretty low on both of these. Most people recommend
druid or ranger if you want to see the sights.

The third is that you should always seek information before you travel.
Normally you might ask seasoned adventurers or consult a guide book,
say the one at www.eqatlas.com which mentions that Lesser Faydark
has a level range of 6-30,40-45. In other words you either want to
be insanely careful or leave it for a visit somewhat later. 

Of course if you can't handle the repetitive nature of killing 
thousands of, more or less, innocent monsters then you probably
should consider another game.
