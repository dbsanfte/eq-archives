Wow...now I know why all the after-market Halloween scarecrows have
disappeared so quickly.  There've been so many straw men getting
knocked down in this thread that they've just about all been used up.

Private property gives you the right to define, not words, but
_acceptable standards of behavior_ while on that property.

To use an analogy (which is doubtless going to be picked apart, since
all analogies are imperfect anyway):

That's why, for example, some businesses are smoking permitted and
others are no-smoking.  If someone who doesn't smoke comes into a
smoking business, he can complain all he wants that there is behavior
there (smoking) that is unacceptable to him.  But if the management
has defined smoking as being acceptable behavior in that business,
they can simply tell him to put up with it or leave.  And that
non-smoker can choose to leave.

If enough people leave because of the smoking, the business will
adjust the standard of behavior accordingly out of
self-preservation--creating separate smoking facilities, or even
banning smoking altogether.  But if it's only one or two people out of
their entire clientele, the business will accept their defection as a
cost of providing a congenial atmosphere to the people it wants to
keep.

It seems to me that 42 has been complaining that what the CoH
management deems the "acceptable standard of behavior" vis a vis
"killstealing" does not match his own acceptable standard, which he
formed via EverQuest.  A lot of hot air has been expended as to whose
standard is more reasonable, and what standards CoH should actually
have.  I think at this point both sides of the argument should
probably just agree to disagree (and/or killfile each other) because
there's no way either one is going to convince the other of the
correctness of his position.

CoH's acceptable standard regarding what some people call
"killstealing" seems to be that the act of attacking a mob someone
else is fighting is not wrong _as an isolated incident_; there is no
actual "theft" since both parties only get credit for the damage they
actually did.  However, a pattern of doing this repeatedly can be
considered harassment, which is wrong.

Any evidence presented so far regarding how many people consider this
definition to be reasonable (or, conversely, how many people do not)
is anecdotal.  This does not mean it is invalid; it simply means that
it is hard to generalize based upon it.  Certainly some people
consider it to be valid; others do not.  Those people who do not are,
of course, free to complain about it to the developers, and/or to
leave.

The fact that the developers have apparently not, in any of the posts
about what they're looking at changing for future updates, mentioned
"killstealing" at all, and the fact that City of Heroes has apparently
not experienced any mass exoduses yet suggests to me that this issue
is probably either not a problem at all, or else not a large enough
problem to be a gamebreaker, for enough players to make a difference.

Of course, I could be wrong--but then, so could we all!
