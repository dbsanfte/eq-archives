My biggest complaint is Groups that are looking for players not adding their
groups to "Groups Looking For Players". If you do a /lfg on you will be seen
in the tool, even though the tool may have the button LFG On not greyed-out.
I was in a LDoN group yesterday looking for a player, I had to remind the
leader to add our group to the list. We got that 6th player in no time!
There are times that there are no GLFP listed but I hear a ton of OOC's from
groups!
