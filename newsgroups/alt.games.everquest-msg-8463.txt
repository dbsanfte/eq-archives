Go hunt somewhere else. There are many diferrent mobs of all
levels. Its a big game.

At the higher levels 1 death will equate to several hours with of
play time.

We could all debate for hours about what is the 'right' amount of
experience to lose on death. Some would even argue for no penalty
at all. But we would never come to a concencus. Verant is the final
decision maker and the death penalty has been what it is for 2 years
now and I don't see Verant changing it any time soon. Though stranger
things have happened.

My question is why do you need to level faster? Are we in a race? Is
there a prize at the end, or to get to level 60? If so then someone won
that prize a long time ago.

My point is its the journey that is the game, not the end.

Just concentrate on having fun, the experience will take care of itself
eventually. This is a game you are supposed to have fun. My contention
is if you are not having fun then you are doing something wrong.
The game is what you make of it.
