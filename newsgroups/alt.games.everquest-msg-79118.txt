C'mon, you can't tell me that you actually enjoy having to kill
hundreds of young rockhoppers (literally) in order to get 2 claws.

What a boring waste of time.  Personally, I'm going to try to finish
this newbie quest because I've already sunk so much time into it but
my advise to most newbie vah'shir beastlord players is wait until
you've improved your tailoring skill enough not to get frustrated,
then do this quest.
