No, no notification yet. :P  But my two thoughts on this are: 1) not until
after they close applications will anyone be notified and 2) the testing
itself starts in June, so we know it is before then!  Not very helpful,
but the best I can contribute.

I can also say that eqii.com or the official boards will go berzerk once
someone gets an invitation (and moorgard has said that he has
quasi-hand-picked members of the community from various fan boards he
knows would make good beta testers, so *someone* will be able to tell us
they got an invite), so I'll be happy to relay that here when it happens
if you don't make a habit of visiting either of those two sites David.
