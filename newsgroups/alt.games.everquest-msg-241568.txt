Been there, done that, Paladin pulling, four mobs in camp.  OK, so the 
cleric died on that pull, but I kept everyone else alive while we killed 
the four mobs, and pulled a few more waiting on the cleric to come back 
from LD and get rezzed in and get mana.  It did take us longer than 25 
minutes to finish, around 50 as I recall.
