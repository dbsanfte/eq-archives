Happens a lot at Frenzy camp in Velks. The people there make sure it's
always a high dam group with some essential utilities always around. Best
grindage comes when your melee don't pull.
Couple of times I was there I've seen the following classes pull:
- Chanter, pulled as many as he could find, parked them at our grindspot,
warrior only had to switch targets, taunt and continue hacking. Chanter used
epic for haste and we didn't bother about slows because of the extra dam
from a DS. Best group ever, we were the only 6 in the zone and even kept
half the groundfloor clear (that's frenzy, CE, Left Wall and Right Wall.
Mobs repopped before we could pull from backwall)

- Cleric, great puller. Only stopped once in a while to drop a complete on
the tank. Used root to park mobs nearby, I nuked those to get them to our
camp for us to continue grinding.

- Bard, he mainly used fear to get lots of mobs, AoE Mez from chanter.

- Mage, me! Mostly because we had mainly damage dealers (pally healer) and a
chanter without epic who was half the time lom because of hastes and
continuous mezzes. I kept frenzy and CE clear by pulling with bolts over
"large" distances (you can drop a bolt on a mob from frenzy to the
groundfloor. Great pulling that way :) )

And the most odd one:
- Rogue. we had a 1 tank, 3 rogue, 1 cleric, 1 mage (me!) group. We kept
running out of mobs and velks was pretty crowded so everything under us got
pulled. One rogue was a bastard and sneaked next to CE and as soon as there
was a pop he'd backstab then run the mob up. CE group usually never saw the
pop at all (or the rogue "stealing" it from them).
