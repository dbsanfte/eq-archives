Most skill ups I work on start at about 50 skill points higher than my 
current skill; in other words, whatever the next relatively cheap 
combine is I can find that isnt' too close to my current skill.

In fact, at the low end of some skills, I might be working on something 
more than a hundred points over my level; pottery and baking come to 
mind, where its simply not worth while bothering trying the low end 
stuff, just do fish rolls till you can't get skill ups any more, and 
literally destroy most of the product.

If the UI people think the same way I do, all is well and good, but if 
what they mean by "some above it" is "things within 5 points of trivial" 
this is practically useless for skill up work, at least till you get to 
the point where each skill up is -very- expensive and you expect to get 
a lot of milage out of selling successes back to the vendor or something.

Splendid
