On the bridge to EW, right next to the zone... and at a corner, too, not
smack in the center.

Then zone to EW and bind again, because there is no good place to
bind in Iceclad, nor any real reason to do so.

EW and GD are much better zones, or you can try your hand at CC
if you like.  Iceclad is the Firiona Vie of Velious, a zone more to
be crossed than hunted in.  Get that GD tooth as soon as you can,
too, since porting into Iceclad is a death trap... if not for you (you
should be invis when porting in) then for your porter (although there
-is- a way to port in invis, few know it and fewer still go to all that
trouble. Easier to die and get a res, I guess!)

By the way, with levels for your characters I could give you
more specific pointers for where/what to hunt in Velious
