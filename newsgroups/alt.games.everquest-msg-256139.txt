The fact that your guildies are not just pushing you to do it, but 
actively doing what they can to help should be a pretty good answer as to 
how valuable the cleric epic is to have.

Most raiding guilds will require the epic, it really is that useful.

Doing the quest sucks, no question about it, but, most everyone I know 
that finally completed it was quite happy they did.
