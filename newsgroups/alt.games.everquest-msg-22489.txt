Well, get yourself outdoors, then.  My first cleric had to spend a lot
more time healing, somehow I didn't discover the joys of the fear
kite till I was in my early 40s.  Now, even at 50, a small group can
take down a yellow mob, high five each other, and say "70M, go pull
another" while chortling at the "after 30 you'll never fight anything
but blues" crowd.

Which is to say, second fiddle.  They can park a few adds to some degree
of reliablility, by taking themselves largely offline as buffing/debuffing
agents... the best park from a bard IMO is the charm park.  Too bad
they don't have an AOE version of that puppy!

Yup, that just can't be allowed.  Even if the group can survive a fight
stripped of buffs, the time and energy spent reapplying them is such a waste...
or you find yourself skipping it since they'll just be stripped again, which
means throwing away half the benefit of having clerics, shaman, chanters
in your group.

Well, as I say, I haven't used it much in this incarnation.  If it really works
that well in the new antitaunt role, I might use it more.  Used to just leave
me exposed to more danger in a bit, unless somehow people managed
to get things under control while their cleric was gone.

Silly question, the ranger.  He has the aggro, he needs a celestial now,
followed
by a superior that only the celestial will let him live long enough to survive.
He
also needs the hotkey that tells him to stop using the good weapons and get
out that stupid big but slow two hander I gave him and stop trying to hurt
stuff so much.

Now that the ranger is dead (because there's only so much you can do for
when he taunts like a wizard trying to KS the other group...and has
approximately
the same AC and HP totals) the warrior needs one, followed by the paladin,
then a CHeal for the warrior, while the pally does a LOH on himself, and we
wish we could figure out a way to actually make more sound come out
of the enchanter's sound card since he's obviously watching the end of the
Mists of Avalon while the frogs we were trained with eat us alive.  Oddly,
all the MEZ THEM NOW all caps typing in the world won't do a thing
for the visually impaired "screen deaf," though.  So here we are stuck using
"its dead, assist me on the next %T" as our mez, running celestial
continuously on both tanks who are pingponging the love.  Why am I
not root parking or something to control the masses?  Well, to make this
a healing scenario, I"m imagining that I'm with a higher level party doing
stuff thats all yellow or red to me, and I can't stick a damn thing without
that chanter tashing... sure wish we had a mage or shaman to Malaise,
but no, its me an afk chanter, two sponges and a damage producer.

You don't have a heal faster than stun, and he can mes the mob in the
six seconds that will buy him, while that heal buys him more time to
live but he has to cast while being beat on.  Sure, like me, at higher
levels his channeling will probably let him shrug off two mobs pounding
on him and still get the spell off, but I"m sceptical about his ability to
live that long... your reaction+heal time is by necessity longer than
my reaction+stun time, although you do have a faster heal available
to you than I do.

If you have time to do all those things then your enchanter is watching the
same Mists of Avalon finale as mine was.  Plans that get aggro off
the chanter 30 seconds from now aren't very interesting, he has to be
quicker than that or we are all dead.  Immediate short term solutions
are necessary here, and they don't particularly have to last.

Never heard of it.  But then, my equipment sucks, and I just don't pay
much attention to it.  Up thru 30 or so I was wearing a full suit of
banded that I made myself at 10th.  Then I got a buddy to make
me FS plate for a few levels, although I eventually replaced it all
piece by piece with more decent gear, its nothing that would make
you scream Twink if you saw me wearing it in my 30s.  On the other
hand, this is the "spell loadout" thread, we could start an "equipment
loadout" one if you like.
