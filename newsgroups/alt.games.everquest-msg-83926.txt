That's just fucking mean.

It's a cute toy, and doable with the right groups.  If a quest is
"broken," I don't blame the programmers if they're working on a
fix or trying to find out what's wrong.  DELIBRATELY having a
placeholder ground-spawn is just wrong, if the guy is still
giving out the quest.  That's just about the meanest thing I
can think of to do to a player who logs on and spends several
nights running around in Iceclad looking for a ground-spawn.

That's just fucking sick in the head, because it's NOT a bug,
it's deliberate.
