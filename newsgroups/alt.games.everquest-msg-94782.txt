Not positive, but I believe that was the point of the original post. He
got upset that some mage was getting xp while he was afk through his pet
farming low blues, aggro'd a quad on the pet (thereby getting the afk
mage on the hate list) and got him killed. Not exactly something I'd be
bragging about here, though.

Then again, I may have missed the gist of the story, given the way it
was written. If so, apologies in advance.
