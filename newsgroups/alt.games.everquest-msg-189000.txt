I think you need to reread what I wrote. I believe that the UN, based
on French agitation, is engaged in appeasement of the first order. I
believe that this war is a pressure-stop that can prevent a much
larger war in the future. Therefore, I think that by dithering on the
war, the UN is putting the entire planet in danger and, as such,
failing in its most basic mission.

I never suggested the UN's purpose was to rubber-stamp the US's
position. I don't rubber stamp the US's position. When the UN takes up
an assinine position, regardless of whether the US takes the same side
or not, I consider them assinine.

I have never taken the position "my country, right or wrong" nor asked
anyone else to. My country is wrong far too often for that to be a
guiding principle.

As I clearly stated, the French are afraid of their own African-Moslem
minority and what they will do if displeased over France's actions in
the Middle East. This has made them cowards at the best of times and
collaborators at the worst.

No. "Unenlightened" means focusing on the short-term while the
long-term goes to shit. The French have their eyes so firmly glued on
the prospects of short-term profit and appeasement that concerns about
little things like pending armageddon don't enter their field of view.

Even at my most cynical, I don't think that this war is about oil,
except in the sense that every action in the Middle East is about oil.
I don't think it's about liberating the Iraqi people, either. I admit
there's a chance that it might be about Saddam being much closer to
WOMDs than the US government can safely reveal, but I don't think
that's necessary to make this a good war.

I think the primary purpose of this war is regional influence. Iraq as
a US ally could exert huge amounts of influence on Iran (an
acknowledged enemy terrorist nation) and Saudi Arabia (an
unacknowledged enemy terrorist nation.) Right now, the United States
exerts strong influence on the region through Israel, Baharain, and
Kuwait and weak influence through Saudi Arabia.

More specifically, this war is about our relationship with Saudi
Arabia. In most ways that matter, the Saudis are the real leaders of
this region. And, while they usually pay lip service to friendship
with the US, they are the single biggest supporter of anti-US and
anti-Israeli terrorism in the world. A secondary concern is the
current state of Iran, which is hovering on the edge of revolution.
Keeping that revolution in tune with its current pro-democratic
pro-personal-freedom leanings is incredibly important to the stability
of the region. There are plenty of Taliban-style elements in Iran who
would gladly grab power in the chaos of revolution.

The war will, incidentally, liberate millions of people from the
control of a genocidal megalomaniac. It will also, coincidentally,
take away the ability of regional Moslem radicals to use the world oil
market to extort action from the global community. Both of these are a
good thing. I don't believe this war would have happened unless the
goal of stopping regional support of terrorism were on the table.
Dubya had been in office nearly a year when 9/11 occured. During that
time, he made no hostile overtures towards Iraq and seemed hell-bent
on an isolationist policy, particularly in relation to the Middle
East. I can't believe that anyone who has actually thought about the
issue can seriously think that this war is about oil.

The US is not indifferent to North Korea. We're pursuing diplomatic
options there, the same way we did with Iraq for twelve years before
the current war. Are you suggesting that it's bad for us to go after
Saddam after he's violated seventeen UN resolution, but it would be
okay to go into North Korea before even giving the UN a chance to
draft a single resolution?

North Korea's saber rattling is not more dangerous that Saddam's slow
move to rebuild his war machine in clear contravention of
international censure. Southeast Asia is not the Middle East.
Restarting a nuclear power program is not stockpiling anthrax. North
Korea has not invaded her neighbors or committed genocide on her own
people. North Korea is not a state under UN administration for recent
malfeasance. And again, the US is *not* ignoring them. We're working
to keep the situation from turning into one where military action is
necessary. To suggest that the two situations are even comparable is
deeply disingenuous.
