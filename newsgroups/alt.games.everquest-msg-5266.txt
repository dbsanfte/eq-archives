Actually, you can re-size your chat window to catch many lines of chat (may
require SoV, dunno).  I read on the EQ board lately that it catches the
bottom 10 lines showing in your chat window.  So, if you have 20 lines
showing, you just have to be careful where it is when you /report.

Besides that, I agree with Davian...sound like you goofed.  Not a huge goof,
it's certainly one that *I* still make on occasion...just try not to do it
again. :)

As for saving dialogue for your own use (GMs don't take logs, ever) you can
automatically log all chat by going into eqclient.ini and changing the
logging to True.
