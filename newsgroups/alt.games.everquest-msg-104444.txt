    Congrats! The spells at 49 are really nice - try and put a push on, as
much as your guild commitments will let you (RP guild with lots of events,
right?)

    A pick-up raid? You were a brave druid! ;-) Fear is a very unforgiving
place. One of our server's top guilds recently wiped out just breaking in,
much to their embarassment. I've seen other, not-so-l33t guilds get hammered
and forced to call in help to get corpses back. I guess if Fear was
perma-camped on your server it wouldn't be too dangerous, but be aware that
people on a pick-up raid don't always feel the need to help other raiders if
things turn south.

    Was it fun seeing a train like that? It takes some getting used to the
idea that yes, we can kill that many things. Fear is bad for stuff like that
because of the dispellers - whenever we clear Fear I always chain-stun them
because I hate getting rebuffed.

    What are your settings? First off, if you have a cable modem get that
datarate.txt file set to 9. Next, try turning off particle effects, PC names
(you can always /target or /rt folks for buffs), level of detail, set PC
spells to you or group only, set NPC spells to off, turn off crits, and if
things are still bad turn off Luclin graphics. I'd also mention doing a
/serverfilter on, but it appears to be broken right now and not filtering as
intended.

    Did you folks use a raid channel, or just use a normal channel like
/shout? If you used a custom channel, how did you like it?

    Seems like every planar set of armour has one or two "dud" pieces. Guess
VI thought players wanted well-rounded stats. Drop rates in Fear are pretty
low - never go expecting more than one or two pieces to drop for your class.

    If you didn't accidentally evac your group out, you did fine for a first
time! :-)
