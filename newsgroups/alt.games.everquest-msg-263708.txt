You know the drill. This is from
http://eqiiforums.station.sony.com/eq2/board/message?board.id=general&message.id=216327&view=by_date_ascending&page=1&no_redir=true
or  http://makeashorterlink.com/?X3DB21199 if you like your link a bit
shorter. My comments are in brackets. The brackets, I tell you, the
brackets!


"1) Lag - the team is hard at work addressing the lag that's seen in a
few zones (Antonica and Commonlands are the main ones). They know
exactly what the problems are and are simply banging down the list
addressing them. This will go away soon. We have very deliberately
been pushing larger numbers of people through a smaller number of beta
servers to specifically handle performance issues on the server."

(Like the WoW stress test I guess. Except the WoW stress test started
stable and got shakier as time went on, this sounds like the opposite.
We'll see....)

 
"2) Class Diversity - One of the things about EQ II that everyone
should realize is that it is NOT EverQuest Live... nor is it intended
to be."

(Man it could be a third person shooter in space and people would
still think its like EQLive. Not a winnable battle, Smed!)


"This isn't watered down EQ, EQ Lite or any such thing. It's just a
fundamentally different experience from the ground up. It's designed
to grow from less diversity at the lower levels to much more diversity
at the higher ones. We think that we've been able to capture the soul
of EverQuest and add some new and interesting twists to the overall
experience. We've focused a massive amount of attention on Quests and
storyline around the different classes.. and what we're seeing is the
testers seem to like that focus. Our goal is to get players through
the lower levels of the game quickly so that they can reach the point
where the classes really diverge.   We have more distinctive class
features that we'll be adding in the days and weeks ahead (traps on
chests were just added for example). The team is working around the
clock adding content and is this is really the fun part for them..
getting to make new and unique skills and abilities AND ways to use
those in the game."

(Makes it sound like its nowhere close to release, doesn't it? If EQ2
goes gold in a month and they're still working on this, then look out
Nelly....)

 
"3) High-end spec - I've seen a lot of posts about how the game is
pretty CPU and graphics card intensive. One of the things I've been
the most pleased with is the amazing amount of options we have that
can give the players the ability to fine-tune the frame rate for
themselves. We run well on lower end machines when you turn down
things a few notches. We've made this very simple for the players to
do, and we have a utility that can check out the players machine and
reccomend the best specs based on the results. Our thinking on this is
long term."

(You mean you ripped off the code from EQPlayNice, don't you Smed...)


"We wanted to make an engine that would tax even high-end machines
*NOW*.. because we're in this for the long haul."

(That's one way of looking at it. Say this again after we know whether
the framerate issues are solved at release, okay?)


"4) State of the infrastructure - we have 4 Beta servers currently
accessable to the public - a total of 22 are up and running, but most
are not viewable by the beta testers for now (this will be changing
shortly)."

(Sounds like a massive increase in the number of betatesters, doesn't
it.)

 
"5) Station Players - I know many of you saw that IGN preview of
Station Players (our new web based community tools).. we'll be opening
this up to the beta testers sometime next week. It's a pretty amazing
collection of tools and fun stuff for our players. We've spent a lot
of time focusing on how to help the community with tools for  managing
guilds.. a knowledge base of items (the list actually grows on it's
own as new items are discovered..), player web pages. I think what
we've got is pretty cool, but you be the judge."

(I don't know wtf this is talking about. Obviously not something
addressed in Bob's writeups! Oh wait, I did see on the WoW boards some
people mentioning official guild boards. Sounded like it was something
even they (the epicenter of SOE hatred) thought was cool, so might be
worth seeing.)

 
"6) Misc. Bugs - remember, we're still in Beta. Obviously there are
bugs, but the team is fixing things at an amazingly fast rate right
now. Anyone that wants to can feel free to post the patch notes from
the past few months. See for yourself!"

(Other people have also mentioned that the EQ2 patch notes are just
jampacked with things. But it still doesn't sound like its anywhere
near being ready for release.)


That is all.
