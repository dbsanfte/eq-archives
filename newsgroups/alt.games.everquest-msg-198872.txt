...snort....

{:-) Damm, what a whingy bastard. Complaining 17 times {:-)
It took two months for my complaint to come up, then a few more weeks of
basically writing a reply in such a method that someone got pissed
enough to reply to me and actually read what my bug report is. 

Eventually, they must have done something because my chances of crash on
zoning in OoT is far far less,

Of course, they never admitted they did something.

Don't hold your breath.
