As a warrior doing his newbie armor quests, and also collecting the
ingredients needed for the weapon quest that finishes the collection(jagged
blade of the steel warrior), I have yet to find one piece needed for the
weapon quest.  A Lion Paw.

I have killed approximately a hundred lions of different levels and names in
the zones surrounding freeport and haven't seen anything that even closely
resembles them.  I can not even find them listed on any site.

If anyone has any information, please let me know either here, or in the
game.  I am Thessalon, level 9 warrior on Lanys.
