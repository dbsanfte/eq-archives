Selos?  55 bard needs someone to sing selos for him?

You have a 2 minute selos already.

Plus selos sucks anyway, you should have picked up JBoots/TBoots
back in your 30s.

But now don't bother, stop leveling for a couple hours and get
Run 3

Selos is the song you sing if you want to move across zones
quickly, not the one you use while actually killing stuff, even
the 2 minute one uses up a song slot or forces you to swap in
songs.

At any rate, your list said what one bard does.  Listed 5 songs. 
What does the other bard do, sit on the sidelines trying to find
a rhyme for Orange?

Llyric, 57 bard, Morel-Thule

ps, adds are just more exp for the swarming bard
