Actually you guys missed a great comment on this story.  I'll copy it over to

Edit: I just noticed this:

For reasons unexplained, the hacker sent all of the proprietary files that
were hacked to a Sony executive, "making it evident that (he) had illegally
obtained the files." Until then, Sony Online Entertainment was unaware of the
extent of the intrusion.

You know, some people just should be sterilized for their own safety. Did he
think SOE was going to congratulate him on his l33t skillZ or something?
