I disagree.

If you don't specify how much something costs, or the minimum you'll perform
a service for, then you should have no expectations regarding what you'll
get.  If you have a minimum, make sure your potential passengers KNOW it.
Otherwise, you do nothing but make yourself angry because someone wasn't a
mind reader.

There's nothing wrong with saying "Porting for donations, 10pp minimum" or
whatever.  It'll weed out the people who aren't worth your time.

Conversely, you get what you ask for.  . .  ;)
