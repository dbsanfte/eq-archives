If you are in a top guild, it suprises me your guild doesnt use an RKP
system.
Apart from that I think you need a head adjustment, killing mobs is work,
loot is bonus.
You sound alot like teens did back in the 80's when they played monty haul
adventures.
- "I WANT MO PHAT LEWT!"

At higher levels you will get less new loot, because you prolly got phat
lewt from before. Thats what the end game is like. If you dont like it,
reroll a newbie level 1 and dont twink. You should atleast manage to get a
new cloth armor piece a day.
