Hm.... I read your post and got out of the raid, claiming lack of sleep, 
which is true enough (oh, the joys of raiding with an American guild when 
you are in GMT). No harm done, we hadn't even started buffing.

My faction with the Dwarf King is max KOS already, through doing the 
Stein of Moggok quest, although the rest of the dwarves love me. Go 
figure. =)

Anyway, thanks for the info!
