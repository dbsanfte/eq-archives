There is a derv(I believe) in North Ro(I believe) that will sell to pretty
much anyone that doesn't have bad derv faction. As far as I know, the only
way to get bad derv faction is to kill dervs. She sells the basics, a great
resource for KoS people.

On a side note, are you sure you can't get any in your guild?
