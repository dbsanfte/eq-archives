I have heard that paper white is supposed to be good for lessening eye
fatigue when using the computer. Have you ever tried different
contrast and/or brightness settings to see how it affects you?

I have used PC's for many years now, and have never noticed a problem
with my eyes, even with 12+ hours a day for weeks and months at a
time. Just lucky, I guess, as I am not bothered by flourescent lights
either.
