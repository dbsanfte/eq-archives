Well, this is slightly freaky, but I do not appear to have either iptables 
or ipchains files in /etc/sysconfig. Both scripts in /etc/rc.d/init.d/ 
point to that directory, so it's not like they ended up in some other 
place.

I suppose Mandrake is storing that information somewhere else. Looks like 
it's time to RTFM again. The freaky thing is that it *was* working for a 
while... I do think something must be broken in Win2k. At least, with you 
can stop and re-start network services without a reboot... :)

By the way, I'm using dial-up with a dynamic IP address, although I do have 
every intention to get into firewalling and security sooner rather than 
later, to acquire good networking habits, and in preparation for when I do 
get an always-on connection.

Thanks to you and Gary for your help... I'll post any relevant progress 
made.
