Same here, if it wasnt for the RvR I would have moved on long ago..... RvR
makes the game more fun, it's always fun, you always need to be alert. Every
encounter is -new-, i mean it's always different, different tactics,
different players you encounter etc.

Were DAoC just PvE it would be boring after you gotten your first lvl 50,
just same procedure for next char you lvl. Now the boredom of lvling
(exaggereted a bit here ;p ) is underbroken by some RvR now and then
(talking about Battlegrounds). Dark Age of Camelot is best MMORPG so far in
my opinion!

Nevertheless I am very curious about World of Warcraft, I sure hope it can
compete with DAoC, if not I'll just stick to the game I like best !
