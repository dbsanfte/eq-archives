Being a shaman, not currently actively working on SS faction, and being that
arctic wyvern hides are necessary for some very spiffy shaman tailored
armor, I have no qualms about killing them.  Well, not entirely true, there
is a small twinge if I con them first, as while I used to be KOS, as a
result of much giant killing, they are now amiable.  I have refused to kill
any Othmir however, as they are cute, and have all those baking supplies
besides.

I have played around in Skyfire a bit, and there are certainly plenty of
mobs there that you can solo.  Burning Woods is also a possible choice for
you.
