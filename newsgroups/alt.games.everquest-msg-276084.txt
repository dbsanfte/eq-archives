Short answer is yes, the augs are a major PITA.

  Maybe the RNG just hates me, but I had a horrible failure rate on them 
in spite of my tradeskills being as high as they possibly could be, and 
having the appropriate trophy equipped for the small skill mod. This was 
before the tradeskill caps were raised, mind you, so it might not be 
quite as painful now.
