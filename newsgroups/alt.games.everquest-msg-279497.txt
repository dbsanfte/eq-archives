Damage avoidance has been a tertiary concern really, behind damage
output and rapid recovery (FD and mend).  I came to terms with not
being a tank shortly after Kunark and haven't really looked back.  I
was mainly concerned that monk DPS has been overshadowed by several
other classes; BL, rogue, ranger, beserker.

It used to be that monks were the ultimate non-caster DPS.  Then
rogues started getting badass when people figured out roguery didn't
really do anything and they just went for str and backstab.  It seemed
to go downhill from there.

Reading the posts from people on this thread seem to contradict posts
I received about beserkers; I was making one for a new group.  At that
point people were saying beserkers were on a close par with rogues for
DPS, and since rogues are supposed to be the highest non-caster DPS in
the game now I kinda figured that put monks at least 2 classes behind.
Then hearing about BL's and ranger AA's, well, I got slightly bummed
about it.  Not alot, just slightly.  I still love
on-the-run-or-while-fighting FD.  It just doesn't have an equal imo.

In any case, it seems there are alot of opposing viewpoints regarding
DPS; some say BL's overpowered, others Beserkers, though most agree
rogues are at or near the top.  So since there doesn't seem to be alot
of consensus I think my question was answered, albeit a little
circuitously.

Monks are still viable.

Thanks.
