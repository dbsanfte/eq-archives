Thanks for the quick answers.

But here is the confusing part from the Everquest Trilogy manual page 70

"PRACTICE. You can visit a Trainer at your local guild hall to improve your
weapon skills. The first few lessons are free, since you start the game with
spendable practice credits. Later, you "can" pay for quick tutoring
sessions.
(Right-click on the guild master or trainer, then click on the skill you
want to
practice.)

Now english is not my native tongue but this sounds like you can somehow
train with money.

Regards
