I strongly disagree with this.  Unless a person is a die-hard player or has
friends willing to power-level/twink them, it should take a VERY long time
to get to a high level.  It took me almost 4 year (since June 99) to get
50th level.  Some of the reasons being that I did a lot of exploring, would
take breaks from the game occasionally, poor equipment (ie wasn't able to
deal with the mobs that gave good experience), and was as interested in the
social aspects of the game as the levelling.  Anyone who is new to the game
and NOT exploring and looking around is missing out on a wonderfull part of
the game.

I agree.  The boat wait was a tedious part of the game, and I believe that
there are many events built in the game that requires players to sit around
with nothing to do (which they tried to cover up with Gems).  That being
said, I thought that Luclin and the Nexus was a fair balance.  As was
mentioned in the original post, new players are missing out on a lot by
using the books to travel.

A new race isn't going to mean much to a new player.  All the races are new
to someone who hasn't played before.

Again, the casual way in which you dismiss 1-50 suggests you mostly deal
with die-hard players (by die-hard I would suggest maybe 20 hours a week).
Most people don't have that kind of time to dedicate to the game.  You
probably don't notice them because they'll get on the game casually look for
a group, play for a while, then log off to get on with their lives.

Again, I think you're hasty with the use of the word "most".  I really don't
think the above statement applies to over 50% of EQ players.

Most of my friends play EQ.  Some quite a bit more than I do, some quite a
bit less.  We have all been playing since 1999, and only one of my friends
has more than one character over 50th level.  And he tends to get bored with
the high level game and starts up a new character.  Aside from the video
demands of the recent expansions (too much for my system, but that's my
problem), and the ease of travel using PoK, I like what's being done with
EQ.  As there things I would change?  Yes, many, but there are others who
wouldn't like the changes I'd make, so who's to say what's the best way to
go.  The original post suggested that EQ is catering mostly to the
established characters, and not adding anything for new players.  I have to
agree.  After all, if a new player makes a 1st level character and sees
another 1st level character with a lot of nice (doesn't even have to be
uber) gear, imagine how they would feel.  (And being handed cast-off gear as
some sort of charity case only hurts the gaming experience...not to mention
breeds beggers)
