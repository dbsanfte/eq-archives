Pfft. I could cross the center line on a highway by merely not paying 
enough attention, and the punishment for that is quite severe. I don't 
think your philosophy in this regard is grounded.

Except for the fact that when the punishment is more severe, you'll tend 
to take more steps to avoid the mishap. You have control.

Yeah, I've never quite figured that one out. I do believe the higher the 
reward the higher the risk.

Doh. You're right. I wasn't thinking. Darned game changes have gone to 
my brain.

No, but avoiding it *is*.

Not a fair comparison.

I've not seen any alternative to the PoK books come from you, so it was 
a safe enough assumption. Perhaps I'm not hearing your point in full.

That makes some sense.

Perhaps scattered outposts where prices aren't nearly as good as a more 
familiar locale.
