Often it's not the warrior at fault. The warrior (on a raid) can only
influence the way the mob is facing. more often than not, it's the rest
of the raid not adjusting their position that are the ones who end up
pushing into walls. 

>not having arrows to tag. 

I prefer agro radius pulling in the vast majority of situations. More
difficult to use well, but in my experience, a lot safer.

> being slow to pick a target/react to pulls

This is my area of expertise, since I've always believed that it's the
single most important aspect of trash clearance on raids. Positioning
during kill is important, but for the most part, tanking an ubermob is
putting yourself in your healers hands, without that much control. It's
during trash pulls a good warrior can shine or dismally fail.

Heavy pull, people dying around you. You have a split second to pick a
target. Which dies first? Wait too long or pick the wrong target, and
the entire raid wipes out, has to run back and summon corpse, and start
again from the last CoH point 'savegame'. This type of situation is the
most adrenaline pumping thing a warrior can control, the warrior knows
no-one else can determine the outcome.
