I've been watching that group for a little while and it appears to be
focused on tabletop games. CoH discussions haven't gotten any traction there
yet, although it's sure arguably more relevant there than here.

I've just started researching the mechanics of creating a new group and I'm
not sure we meet the criteria yet based on relevant message traffic and
expected longevity of discussion.

As for an a.g.e. supergroup, that sounds like a fun idea. My wife and I
joined an existing group on Protector recently based on some really
favorable grouping experiences we had earlier, and it's a good sized group
with some 50+ members. One of the advantages I saw in joining them (in
addition to the obvious benefits) is that we may become one of the first
groups on the server to participate in some of the Trials (which require 50
members belonging to the same SG). I'm eager to see what Trials are like and
how they compare to the kind of raiding that many of us are already familiar
with.
