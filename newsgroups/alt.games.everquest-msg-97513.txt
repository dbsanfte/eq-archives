I have an Athlon 1700+ XP, Epox 8KTA3PRO mobo, Win XP Pro, ISA 3Com modem,
512mb ram, NVidia Geforce4 440MX and was having the same problems, frequent
disconnects, crashing to desktop, etc.  After several phone calls to my ISP
it became apparent that the problem was on my end.   The ISP's tech support
suggested using system restore because that had worked with several other
people with the same problem using either Win ME or XP.  I had reinstalled
my old ISA modem because the problems with EQ and connections in general had
begun with a PCI modem.  Instead of using system restore, I uninstalled the
drivers for the modem in device manager then removed the modem in device
manager.  I then removed the connection from Network Connections, shut the
machine down, waited five minutes, restarted and let Windows redetect the
modem.  After it had finished, I rebuilt the dial up connection by hand
using the ISP's settings (you should be able to get these from the
homepage=> tech support if using a dial-up connection, be sure to obtain
first before you do any of this of course!!).  I connected and now have no
problem staying connected for several days if I forget to shut everything
down.   Also, the crashing to desktop has ceased as well.  Why XP or ME
drops the setting the tech support guy didn't know but says that he is
seeing that occasionally. Hope this helps some.
