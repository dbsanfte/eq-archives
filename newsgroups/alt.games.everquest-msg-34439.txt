Ah sweet, thanks for the info!  I do remember one of the chars /ooc'n asking
if everyone was ready.  It was so cool and I couldn't have timed it better
being there to see it, it sounds like.  I'm just blown away that as that
badboy pop'd in, I was standing right next to him HIDING and he didn't even
know I was there!  Jeesh, my heart was pounding - definitely got my $10
worth this month!
