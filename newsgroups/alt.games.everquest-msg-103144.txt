I think gun powder needs to be added to the game.  Let the Gnomes develope
it and create a new trade skill called "Explosives".  It would be really
cool.  Imagine coming across another locked door and just having to set a
bomb off near it to open it.  Or being able to throw a bomb into King
Crush's throne room.  The possibilities are endless.

Understand that the following is just for humor purposes and if it offends
anyone then I apologize.  You could create explosives that a character could
strap around its body.  Then add a delayed timer.  Then go up to Lady Vox or
some other baddy and pick a fight.  Then once you were eaten the delayed
timer would go off and Bamm.  No more baddy.  Then have a cleric rez you.

The gnomes could also develope crude pistols and cannons.  That would be the
ultimate in UBER weapons.
