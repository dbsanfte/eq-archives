Don't know why you say it's so diluted... even though bards and druids
get the skill, rangers are by far and away still the absolutely best
trackers in the game, period.  They get it right from the get go, it
can go to higher skill levels (as I recall), and they can organize
their track list so the damned thing is actually useful.  Tracking
with a bard is less than optimal, to say the least.

Sorta like Hide and Sneak.  Classes and races other than rogues get
the skills, but the rogue is the best it them, being able to use both
at the same time, and getting a message to tell 'em when they succeed.
The skills are not diluted so long as nobody else gets those little
extras.

That being said, I don't believe that rogues should get tracking.  I
can't give any sort of "factual" reason, it just goes against gut
instinct.  Doesn't have the right feel for the class.
