Actually it does, horses. In fact horses have totally screwed the
economy. No one wants to trade stuff now. No one wants to sell stuff
at reasonable prices. You see the same people auctioning noct blades,
sarnak battle shields and barbed ringmail for days because all they
want is cash and about the max market value of the item in cash. Since
any prospective buyers also just want cash for horsies, no one is
buying.

So its kind of interesting that all the people who screamed "need
money sinks in EQ!",  were basically wrong. Now we have one but its
causing undesireable things to happen. Everyone is becoming Scrooge.

Horses are a huge money sink though. Most people figure they will
build 100 k or more to get the top one. Of course everyone they are
trying to sell stuff to is figuring the same thing and on the low end
some people are just trying to get the 9 k one so they of course are
not going to buy stuff the 100 k person is trying to sell for 9 k or
even 4 k.

They put breeze clarity in as potion money sinks. Not really that bad
at 63 plat plus either (if you have shaman in your guild making at
cost)

You are talking about nickel and dime money sinks which hardly change
the game much. When people can get those services for players for 5
plat or so they are not going to pay more than that from npc vendors.
If npcs were charging only 5 plat for such services it would not be a
money sink really at all.

I really think we should see if the economy bounces back from horses
eventually before we start demanding more money sinks ;) Right now
money is tight as hell. I cant sell fantastic items for incredibly low
prices like 500 plat.
