I'm currently a level 12 summoner in EQ2. I'd like to upgrade at least
my two main spells, the summon and zap spell (can't remember their
actual names), to Apprentice III or Adept I.

Now, I know that Apprentice III can only be bought from artisans (btw,
I tried to make a sage of my own, but was lost as to how to level him
and make money) and Adept I is only dropped from mobs. So, my question
is where can I find someone selling these scrolls? Or, how can i find
out which mobs drops the scrolls I need? Or, is there an artisan/sage
tutorial out there so I can make my own spells?
