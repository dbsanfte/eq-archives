Maybe he was just making a point.

And a valid one at that.

It *did* help you. And there are a lot of people who *expect* the 
warrior to have a certain level of equipment... and who will pass 
playing with him if he doesn't, or at the very least criticize him 
endlessly.

I could see being expected by your groupmates to shell out thousands of 
pp to buy equipment primarily to satisfy your groupmates being more than 
a little irritating...irritating enough to feel the need to get the 
point accross.

...

Then again he might have just been a whiny loser.
