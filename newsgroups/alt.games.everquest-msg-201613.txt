The thing about D&D, and roleplaying games in general, is it's just a
lot more fun with your friends. I've played with random people I'd
never met before and with friends I'd known for a long time, and it's
-always- better with the people you know. Sure, you tend to stray off
topic of the game a lot easier, but that lightens the pace and makes
it more enjoyable. I haven't played since my friends left for the
army, and now I've moved across the country, no hope of getting any
semblence of the old 9 group back again. We've all just completely
seperated, though we keep in touch.
