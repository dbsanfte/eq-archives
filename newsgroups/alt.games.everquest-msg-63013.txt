What do you usually think of players with silly character names like
Bigbadmofo or Hottbunz or Mezztheheckoutof (I actually saw a player
with that name or something really close to it)?  Do you find they are
more likely to be lousy players (beggars/KSing/training, etc.) or do
you know some who are really good players?  Are any of you ever
reluctant to group with somebody just because they have a goofy name?

Oh, I saw another player recently with an iffy name that slipped by
the Name Censors--Tulsytsan.
