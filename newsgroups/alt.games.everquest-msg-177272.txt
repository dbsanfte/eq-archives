Lol.  Definitely keep those skills up, particularly pick lock, hide, sneak,
and, of course combat skills.  I was going to offer to come over and group
last night, after you said something about making the rounds, but, only
character I have at that level is my woefully underequipped warrior (I
really need to see about a haste item).  I do have one or two friends at
around that level that I have grouped with a fair amount, but, one of them
is taking an EQ break, and the other left the guild, and is no longer around
us much.
