It's a half sentence.  It's part of an exclamation.  Hell someone in this
very group even got me to use it (Lokari) when admitting defeat in another
thread and I had to shower several times afterwards to feel 'fresh' again.

It's not finished - a HALF THOUGHT!!! YOUR BAD WHAT??????  Tell us!

People that use 'my bad' probably also say to a stranger 'hey guy!'   GOD I
HATE THAT "GUY" ONE!  Sounds like some prospective gameshow host.

God AND Satan have special places I'm sure for the 'hey guy!' and 'my bad'
types...oh yes...
