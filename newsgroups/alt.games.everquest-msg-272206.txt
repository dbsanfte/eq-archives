Did you voice your opinion in a rational manner or did you bash,
flame, and insult the devs and everyone who supported them? Has this
always been your means of being "incredibly vocal"? 

Yeah, I know what you'll probably answer. But, judging from the tone
of this post, we all know it's a lie. You don't have to use vulgar
language to get banned... If you can't criticize constructively, shut
the fuck up because you're only causing problems, not solving any.
