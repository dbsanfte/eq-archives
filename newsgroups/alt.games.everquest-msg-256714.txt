Well, this way there's exactly one roll, and it always yeilds a clear 
winner, and the ML knows who that is even if people have missed it in 
the spam.  There'd be no reason to stop or even slow down on killing, 
you see an item you like, send in your request, see if you get it.

Compare this to the spam of 20+ people all doing ran 500, sorting thru 
and looking to see who got the high result, checking to see if everyone 
rolled, worrying about whether someone is dead and thus can't roll till 
rezzed...

As long as the ML isn't among the dead everone who puts up for the item 
could be among the dead and it would make no difference.

I've yet to see the system at work of course, so I'm merely speculating, 
but it strikes me that this is just as fair as normal random, and has 
some distinct advantages.
