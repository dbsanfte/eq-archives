     If you know a high level smith, see if he needs leather padding
(made by combining a low quality wolf, cat, or bear skin with one of
those silk threads).  Typically these paddings sell to a smith for 1
or 2 pp each.  Making the padding trivials at a low skill, but the
money for the padding can come in handy.
