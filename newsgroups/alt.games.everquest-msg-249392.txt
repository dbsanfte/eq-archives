I believe you are looking at "in combat" as fighting in a war somewhere
"over there".  Try looking at it from the perspective of if your country had
been taken over by one of your worst enemies.  I'm not trying to tempt you
to evil thoughts but I think you would see things differently if you were in
that position.  Personally, I hope that if we are ever taken over by a
foreign power that we never give up, and that we have people that will go to
any and all lengths to fight them.
