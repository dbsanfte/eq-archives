Reports on EQClerics indicate the respawn time is either 15 minutes or 30 minutes.

Would I have wanted to bet that way?  No.

Do I predict a patch nerfing this rate?  Yes.

Do I hold out hope that they deliberately made the respawn time
waaaaaay to fast in order to clear out the insane backlog of people
who have been waiting up to a year with all other steps completed?  Yep.

Do I therefore fear a long respawn time will be put in place soon, so
I'd sure as Brell better get mine now? Indeed I do!
