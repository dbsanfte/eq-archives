It's the common drop from the Cazic Cenobite, which spawns
in the Avatar of Fear room in Cazic-Thule.  (Ravenscale Boots
are his rare drop.)

The good news is that he's not noticeably tougher than most
of the other lizards in the zone.  The bad news is that the
Avatar of Fear sometimes spawns in the same room, and he
*will* kick your butt even if you can solo any other 3 mobs
in the zone simultaneously.

Alternately, you can buy the potion at auction for about
250-400p.
