As long as you don't mind a LONG time of sitting around waiting for health,
just about any zone with LBs in it would do.  I did /some/ soloing on my
rogue up until 46 or so, and they have the same health downtime that
warriors do.  Only advantage was the Intimidation skill that rogues get:
helps a LOT because rogues can't tank well, and when something runs, BSing
gets a lot easier. :)
