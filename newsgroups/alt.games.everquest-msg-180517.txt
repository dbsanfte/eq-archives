I am qualified to make that assessment based on play experience with the
original game and each of the expansions thus far.

So its wildly successful, and therefore the bugs dont matter and they
must test adequately?  I dont buy into that line of thinking.  Yes, its
wildly successful.  No, they dont test new content enough.

Its utter neglect, not just poor planning.  They dont give a fuck about
QA because they dont have to.

Why is there no doubt that they have paid testers?  What evidence do you
have of this?  They dont test the quests they introduce into the game,
they dont test spell effects.  These are examples you can find in nearly
every patch.  You are telling me that they do have paid testers, but
these people just dont test this stuff?  Why on earth wouldnt they?
What do you think they are testing?  As for the money thing, give me a
break.  $13 a pop from 400K+ active subscribers.  They *can* afford more
testing.  They choose not to because they would make less money.  I am
not against businesses making money, but you seem to think they are
doing their best to supply customers with a working product.  I disagree
completely.
