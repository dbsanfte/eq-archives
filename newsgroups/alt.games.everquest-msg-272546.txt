Run together sounds prone to error, so the scout might find him
self-agro, unable to take the hits and out of range of the healer.
Resulting in one dead scout. It might work most of the times but seems
to be an unnecessary complication to me.

Any spell a mage can cast on a mop will pull it, not necessary damage
ones. I.e. you could ward them (often the first thing mages do anyway)
or root/mez one and the others will come running (often used then
soloing). If they were significant distance away there would be enough
time for the tank to re-agro them. I've done this a few times where a
mob is in a place the tank can't easily get too. But its prone to
errors, far safer to get the tank to agro them in the first place.

My experience of scouts pulling is that they often die before the mob
reaches the group due to them being unable to take the hits before the
mob getting re-agroed of them healed in time. This rarely happens with
a tank.

Last night in CoB one scout kept on starting encounters and a lot of
the time he died before the tank could re-agro them. Once the tank had
them agroed the situation came under control and the mob was killed
easily.
