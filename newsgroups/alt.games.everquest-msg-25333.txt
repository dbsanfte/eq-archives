Oh, of course there's a way for a GM to intentionally get people into
those. They're used as a "prison" to hold players that are persistant
in rules violations that are disrupting the game for others. If you
saw the link to that site with that idiot's story about getting
himself banned intentionally, he talked about the GM summoning him
into one of those near the end of it.
