I've been in groups as far back as EC where people HAD
to have a SoW before they'd play.   And that continued
in just about every zone where sufficient numbers of people
congregated.  If you ever grouped in EC or WC, I'm sure
you've seen (or heard of) people who'd have to run over
to the tunnel every 20 minutes or so for a SoW...

And, of course, the people who had to have a port to
MT because running from EC was "too tough."   Nothing's
changed, IMO.  Those same people just now insist on
having KEI while game changes like the PoK books have
eliminated some of the others.

Like I said earlier, the only real difference is that travel
itself has become so much easier that it has increased the
visibility of something that has existed all along, just for
other buffs.

What, exactly, is the difference between "the very act of being
a KEI vending machine" and "the very act of being a port whore"
anyway?

Not in my experience.  KEI doesn't change aggro rules.  A wizard
who nukes too early still gets aggro and KEI doesn't mean the
mob doesn't stomp him into the floor when he does.

About the *only* things KEI changed was downtime.(since the
casters now don't have to med as long between pulls, if at all)
and allowing lower-level groups to hold areas that they would
have been incapable of doing before.   Neither of those are
"bad", IMO.
