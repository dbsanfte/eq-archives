Not that advanced - it did have it in EQ1 so it sounds like it was left out
on purpose.
 Not sure what purpose it would serve as you can still transfer items and
sell them on the other characters anyway.
If you went to move a stack of coin from your person to the bank via
dragging it, it would make you enter an amount and press accept.
Now it just picks the whole lot up and you can use a control key to bring up
the option to reduce the amount of transfer.
