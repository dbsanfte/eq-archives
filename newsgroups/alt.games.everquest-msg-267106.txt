    They had dozens of alternatives. I say it's an antiquated principle
because it's worked for a hundred years on conventional products, that are
very different to EQ and other product-services.

    Obviously things like that would never have been introduced.

    I've given you five points on how they have been 'destroying' it, and
how they are destroying it now. Did you read my original post? These points
also explained why EQ1 is ultimately doomed by EQ2's introduction. If you
want me to substantiate any of these, why don't you quote one and ask?

    I don't see how that invalidates anything I've said.

    At the risk of repeating myself, I'm not going to argue capitalism VS
socialism. Also, I really don't see how that statement is relevant to this
discussion. I don't believe I was proposing a socialist solution to the
EQ1/2 problem.
