>How would you know there were no GMs on?

I did a /who all GM, but I must have been tired because it didn't even occur
to me at the time the GM's might have been anon or rp, as Dan and Brent are
saying.

I've really never used report or petition before, never really had a need to
up to this point. Thanks, guys, for the info on petition and report.

Much appreciated,
Harken
