You could move back into the luggald caves there in Dulak or try root
rotting in Nadox.

Cast Egress as soon as you zone into Nadox and you will end up in a nice
little open area section by the zone to the Mines. The Shrine Bruisers will
stay blue until you hit 59.  Most were still blue at 59, but lt blues began
to pepper in ,

They were giving me 1%AA exp per kill and take waay less mana than Elysians.

Just be sure to be considerate to other player and root them to the sides of
the open area and not the center! There is nothing worse than exgressing
with low health and "landing on" mobs :)

You might also want to try root/rotting treants in PoN. They have more HPs,
but I have found the AAxp to be better than 1%.
