Sorry if I wasn't clear enough.  I wasn't saying that Paladins
aren't reasonably balanced *overall* when compared to Warriors
(given our spell set).  My parenthetical comment was meant to
admit that our spells do balance things out for us, but that
I wanted to discuss pure melee issues for a moment.

My point is that "but you have spells" has been the excuse
Verant has used for years now to "explain" why Paladins should
not be "allowed" to ever do a single, solitary aspect of
meleeing even as well as a Warrior, much less better, even
in limited circumstances or for limited times (e.g. not even
for 3 minutes out of an hour via a /disc).

It's not that I'm complaining, really -- unlike a year ago,
I think Paladins are pretty well balanced now.

It's just that The Vision has been nearsighted (so what
else is new) when it decreed that Paladins must necessarily
suck rocks in each and every melee aspect compared to Warriors --
even back in the days when Paladins, even *including* taking
their spells into account, were overall highly inferior to
Warriors in balance.

The recent attempted nerf is an example of their continuing
to use this arbitrary rule even when it doesn't make much
sense -- Slay Undead is finally something that allows
Paladins to do *something* better than a Warrior.  And yet
even though it made RP sense for them to do so, and could
only be acquired after massive AA infusions and used only
in a restricted subset of fights, someone at Verant hit
the ceiling because The Vision had been violated and they
got ready to pull out the Nerf Stick.

My post was just my overview of this mindset, and my
way of saying, "guys, get over it".  They should look
at overall balance, instead of simply recoiling in
horror at the very concept of a Paladin ever, ever, ever
doing a single thing with a sword (or armor) on par
with a Warrior.  Or heaven forbid, better at times.

Sure, but I was only describing our sucky disciplines as yet another
example of the "Thou Shalt Not Ever Have Any Melee Ability Even
Equal A Warrior's" commandment in action.  Normally, a discipline
would be a great place to give a class a token ability to
shine -- since they only can be used for a few short minutes
out of a long hour-or-more, they don't affect overall balance
much.  If you wanted to throw a class a bone or give them a
fun toy, that'd be a good place to do it.  But even there,
the "Thou Shalt Not etc." rule was obviously in play.  Take
the Paladin "Holyforge" discipline for example.  For about
three minutes it lets Paladins have a chance to crit/crip
against undead mobs.  It would have been fun if we could have
had a high enough crit rate to get some real eye-candy going
(and remember that "crits" are seldom better than a regular
swing anyway).  But noooooo....  During a typical Holyforge
activation, I get about two crits and one crip, if I'm lucky.
Ooh, baby, hold me back.  The extra damage (if any) amounts
to about one more average swing with my sword.  It's an utter joke.

I wasn't saying that we necessarily deserved improved disciplines.
As you point out, we shine in other areas.  I was just pointing
out that the "Thou Shalt Not etc." mindset has been too
reflexively followed without consideration of whether it
still makes sense.

Luckily, in the furor over the proposed nerf, they finally
actually *did* take a look at it and realize that while it's
a good rule of thumb, it doesn't make sense for it to be set in
stone.
