I would say there is a little more roleplaying by MUCH more polite players.
I don't recall meeting anyone who seemed to be RPing "to the hilt".
If someone in a good group asks where I'm from in real life, I tell them.

BUT (that's a big but) no one goes on and on about real life. I went to FV
server to get away from players who ruined the feel of being in another
world by their zone-wide shouts and OOCs. I also like most of the ruleset.

Let's see... I think I've only read the word "dewd" twice.
