   If EQ were prone to causing depression, I would think
that there would be one hell of a lot more of these suicide
incidents floating around.  How many people play EQ every
month?  And how many of these kill themselves  every month?  
    But to you question; what if EQ caused the depression? 
What do you think would be a reasonable answer?   If EQ is
true dangerous, even deadly, then wouldn't it be reasonable
to outlaw it, and unplug the servers?  Personally, I don't
think buy it.  Unstable people engage in the same activities
that all people do.  Blaming the actions of unstable people
on the activity that many participate in, with the vast
majority of them not end up in tragic endings, is illogical.

though.
