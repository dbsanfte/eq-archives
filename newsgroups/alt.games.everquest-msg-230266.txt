I actually saw that.  =)  I honestly don't think we have problems healing
the MT any more... last time we kept the MT up until TZ was at 50 percent.
What killed us what that darned near every healer was in the CH chain and we
didn't have enough left over to keep the RT up.  The clerics got to
experience TZ's page for themselves and learned to enjoy it for, oh, half a
second.

I think we have the strat down, all we need is numbers.

I am forced to admit, eventually the rogue stopped (actually, he quit EQ
altogether) and the problem was greatly diminished.  I still question the
methodolgy.  One of our rogue recruits has a very nice hotkey the sends a
tell to a corpse's owner asking for consent and very clearly spelling the
rogue's name.  I would think that's a more effective technique than the
yelling and screaming.

I don't have a hotkey up but I do always do a / all guild rogue and consent
the rogues still alive in the target zone.

Well, and that was the other thing - we weren't in position yet.  In fact, I
wasn't even close to my group's bard yet - I couldn't find him in the mass
of people, and I didn't even get a chance before the pull was made.  In
retrospect, a /follow would have gotten me to him quickly.

The next time we tried him it went very smoothly and I even got my 55 pally
keyed for EarthB.  Nevermind that his only other flag is Rallos Zek.  =)

That was my thought as well.

Oh yeah, we felt pretty stupid ourselves even without the guildleader's
ranting.  It was almost comical how everyone was saying "We should get GoD"
and no one sent a tell to a chanter.

The next time we did Arbiter, GoD was cast on my group no less than four
times.  =)

Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking.  I don't want people to think of my
guild as just another CiH.

Very nicely put.  =)

This made me lol in real life.  =)

Thanks for the response, James.
