Actually, it's a pain, but you can teach each other a language.  You can
learn a language to one point above the skill of the person teaching.  So,
train one point into it each.  Then spam until the other person gets an
increase, zone, have the other person spam you until you get 2 increases,
zone, repeat.  At least, this is what I am told, haven't actually tried it.
