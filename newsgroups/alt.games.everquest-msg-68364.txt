	Actually I have a 950 AC these days, which isn't bad for a Ranger still
really below SS/Kael armor level  (I'm only 56; been to HoT once so far and
didn't get horribly slaughtered, but still really should have another level or
two).  The extra 12 points of Defense I just got were a big help.  Hit points
are the real issue.

|Reward is "will I get something for getting gacked lots?"

	No, risk is *what are you going to lose* through average play?  Assuming
that the breaks are even and you don't have highly-skilled players behind the
'toons?  If the answer is "nothing" then there is *no risk*, no matter how
many times you die.  There is only risk to the extent that there is a
possibility that the mission will fail.

	There are better places to go though, where you don't need 10 stacks of
fish scales or perm EB items all around.
