Do not enter anything in that search window.  Just hit SEARCH and you will 
most likely see everything all players want to buy.  If it skips a few, just 
enter the first letter of the last alpha piece in the search box, for 
example, x.  It will then find all items with x in the name.  Then go for y, 
and z.
