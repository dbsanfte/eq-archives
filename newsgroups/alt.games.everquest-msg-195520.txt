Save your pennies, stop by the bazaar regularly and check prices.
Acrylia Plate (or for you, Large Acrylia Plate) is decent, but
pricey and not all the pieces show up as it's mostly made for
purposes of skill-ups on the way to being able to make the racial
armors.  But if you watch for it and get a feel for the "regular"
prices you may manage a bargain.  Barbed Ringmail (ac30 9str 50hp)
is probably the best "cheap" chest piece you'll find, I've seen it
as low as 2kpp on Tunare server, while the Acrylia Plate BP is ac30
10mr 15hp IIRC and usually runs 1500-2k.  Helm of Raldukan has come
down a lot in price but still 3-4kish, pretty sure it is Ogre
wearable.  Really the best plan is to squirrel away pp while making
frequent trips to the bazaar to get a feel for availability and
pricing on upgrades.  If you can find and join a guild that is raiding
Kael there is an opportunity for some nice armor via questing with
the Thurgadin Dwarves (all this in Velious), Kael raids usually seem
to be for characters in the 50 to 55 level range.

good luck,
kaev
