Part of the reason is that the audience for his games were so small.  There 
were precious few people with access to computers, and even fewer who could 
use them for frivolous purposes, like, say, games.

I remember sitting around one guy at OMSI in Portland as he played one of 
Scott Adams' games.  This game had you playing a superspy a. la. James Bond, 
and you were trying to prevent the bad guys from destroying the world.  You 
had to accomplish quite a lot of tasks - and you had to do them in the right 
order.  For embedded within you was a self-destruct device, and it would at 
first begin making a steady ringing sound, then a loud warbling, and then 
you'd blow up.  So not only did you have to do save the world, you had to 
keep your self-destruct device from going off.

So this one guy is playing the game with about a dozen people around him 
(including yours truly, a geeky eight-grader who was so poor he wouldn't own 
his own computer until he was in his late 20's).  He's getting deep into the 
game, but his self-destruct device is warbling, about to go off.  So quickly 
he executes the next step, then the next... and then the message appeared, 
"Your self-destruct device politely beeps", indicating that it's been shut 
off.  Everyone cheered!  It was a very exciting moment.

One of my deepest regrets is that I never finished the pirate adventure.  =(

This all just goes to show that our personal journeys to computer gaming 
nirvana are very different.  I went from Scott Adams to Zork to Leather 
Goddesses of Phobos to King's Quest to Ultima to 7th Guest to... the list is 
growing daily.  Some people began with the original MIT adventure game 
(xyzzy!), some people began with Doom, some with Final Fantasy VII.

Either way it eventually led everyone here, to EverQuest.  Even Scott Adams 
himself.  =)
