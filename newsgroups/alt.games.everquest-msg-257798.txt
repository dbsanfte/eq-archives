Well, today was the big day.  After getting forcibly getting
disconnected after the DX9 upgrade back in...well, whenever, I haven't
been able to play.  Granted, I haven't being playing much of anything.
So the stars were finally in alignment and there was (just barely)
enough cash in the bank for the upgrade.

The old system:
Pentium Celeron 330
128MB PC100 Ram
32MB Voodoo 4
and assorted peripherals.

Now, I'm not saying it played EQ *great* prior to DX9, but it was
still a playable game.  Outside of the PoP and LoY (yay for 2-3 min
load times!), most was playable.  SO i had some fun with friends in
the old world, Kunark and Velious, and tried to avoid PoK and the
Bazaar unless necessary.

So the upgrade:
AMB 64 3000+
512MB PC3200 DDR Ram
256 MB Radeon 9600
and assorted peripherals

Which is quite literally an order of magnitude faster than the old
system.  I'm thinking it will do well...

So I put it together while watching some Olympics, key in my Game
Card, and...

It's Emergency patch day!!

Soem things haven't changed in 5-1/2 years =)

I'll follow up wrt the differences...
