Im was in the same position as you about three levels ago..at level 38.
Ill list a few things that you could get solo, or with a small group. There
are lots of thing you can buy, but that all depends on how much money you
have, how long you want to spend in EC...etc

> Weapon:  Shieldstorm - 22/45 AC 15, Str 5, Dex 10, AGI 15, Resists 5
> (ghoulbane and a Clay guardian shield when I'm fighting casters or undead)

If ya wanna boost your damage dealing (and face it, we pallys always need to
boost our damage), you could maybe buy an Argent Defender or an Arbitors
Combine Greatsword...either would be sweet with your FBSS...twohanders are
pretty cheap, for the damage that they do. And get a Centi or Wurmy to
replace the GB when you arent fighting Undead...and probably when you are
too....Instrument of Nife is all ya need m8)

> Ear:  Cougar Claw Earring - AC 4, Str 3, Dex 2, Orc Fang Earring - AC 3,
Str
> 3, HP 15
> Neck:  Azure Stained Leather Gorget - AC 8, Str 3, Wis 3, Mag 5, Fire 5
> Face:  Silver Ruby Veil - Str 4, Wis 4

Goblin Forged Iron Mask AC8 HP10...Get some of your guildies together to go
get one from the Temple of Droga, or you could do the cougarskin mask quest
in Iceclad...easy at your level.

> Head:  Helm of Ro - AC 13, Wis 8

A good helm

> Shoulder:  Adamantite Epaulets - AC 9, Wis 7

Crested Spaulders AC11 STA6 - Kill the Avenging Caitliff in Mistmoore

> Finger:  Silver Jasper Ring x2 - Wis 2 (bah, these seriously need an
> upgrade)

Get some Jagged Bands AC5 STR3 from Garaniel Rucksif in Unrest...you might
need a partner to help you with that. Ideally you should get some AC/HP
rings from a jeweler...but they are quite expensive for the good ones.

> Wrist:  Serpentine Bracer AC 1, Agi 9, Dex 3,
Throw that in the bin, or give it to your pet monk
> Hardened Kodiak Bracer AC 6, Str 3

Replace these with a Hero Bracer AC9 STR10 and saves..Buy it or quest it
from the warrior guild in Qeynos
and a Bracer of Scavenging AC9 STA5 DEX5...Kill the Iksar Bandit Lord in
Warsliks Woods...slow spawn..but easily soloable at your level.

> Arm:  Fine Plate Vambraces - AC 10
> Chest:  Breastplate of Ro - AC 20, Str 4, Fire 10
> Back:  Dire Wolf-hide Cloak - AC 7, Str 5
> Feet:  Charred Boots - AC 6, Agi 3, Poison 5, Fire 5

You may get some Dwarven Workboots AC8 STR3 DEX5 from Garaniel in Unrest
while getting the Jagged Bands, they are better than the Charred Boots, but
you would be better off trading them with a chain class character for some
higher ac plate boots, Sentry Boots or suchlike.

> Legs:  Greaves of Ro - AC 13, Sta 6, Cold 10

/needs no replacement)

> Hands:  Sebilite Scale Gloves - AC 12, Agi 4, Int 4, Mag 2, Disease 2

Good gloves...but if you have the cash get a pair of Gauntlets of the Black
AC15 STR4 WIS3 (very good pally gloves)...about 350 on Antonius Bayle.

I hope this helps. I know you are going to get peeps telling you "Get
Deepwater...Get Deepwater" but you wont be able to kill for em for a few
levels yet, they wont proc until level 45 and they can be quite expensive.

I think the best and most satisfying way of getting equipment is getting it
yourself...so my list reflects that.
