Firstly, my opinion DOES not mean nothing, it is my opinion and therefore it
means a lot to me, just as I accept that your opinions mean a lot to you.

Secondly, here's the Ninja Looting Part of the Play Nice Policy.

a.. >You may not ninjaloot.
Ninjalooting is defined as taking special equipment from a fallen creature
without the express permission of those who killed the creature if they are
in attendance.

The purpose of this rule is to stop those who stand near creatures that
carry special items and attempt loot that equipment prior to it being looted
by the rightful owner.<



So yes, I stand corrected and accept that my statement is wrong, although
the key phrase there for me is 'if they are in attendance'. As such this
won't stop me looting trash corpses for stuff I use in trade skills, and I
will continue to leave NO DROP items on corpses unless I have permission
from the person who killed it. So I guess I won't be getting banned
according to the PnP after all :)

I also need to point out that looting 'yard trash' in this way has nothing
to do with looting Quest items from Velious Armour Quests for example.
