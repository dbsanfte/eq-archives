nothing wrong.

Something to note:
A few patches ago earned exp was changed. A lvl 50 mob will not give the
same exp to a level 50 as to a level 51 player. Difference in levels now
actually counts to exp modifiers. This was to stop solo classes farming
bottom-darkblue and light-blue cons for good exp.
