Got 20th level with Miznit the Gnome Wizard last night.  Went to the 
traineer and put a point in Evoc (nothing in the others for 
specialization).

Here's the question:  Can ya cast evoc spells on green stuff to get skill 
ups, or is it like melee skills..need a blue or higher?

I can deal with letting it progress normally, but was thinking of getting 
it above 50 before putting points in the other specializations.

If I have to nuke blues and above, I'll just leave it as-is and group until 
I get it above 50....no biggie.
