Hehe. My first character, Brikk, was an ogre warrior who thought he'd
found nirvana when he managed to buy a rusty halberd in Feeroot. This
thing would kill many level 1 and 2 MObs in a single swing. BANG.

It took me days, but after I got my cloth armor, I saved up the 37
plat or so it took to buy a halberd from a merchant. Eventually, I
swapped it out for dual wielding Langseax and Polished Granite
Tomahawk. But, as soon as I got my hands on a Shiny Brass Halberd, I
was back to 2hs.

Somewhere around 21, I managed to upgrade to a Langseax of the Wolves.
By the time I topped out at 26, I had my 1hs/DW/DA maxed, but I still
primarily loved my LotW.

Brikk always lusted after a SSoY, but he never did get one.
