He was. And Copelands Analyzer uses the fact that both hands are independent of each
other. That is why the original post was finding that there was a difference between
his calculations from the incorrect theory and that which is shown by Copelands.

It is believe that double attack has to be 150 before you get a chance to double
attack with a secondary hand. This is possible at level 29 for warriors and rangers.
But since at turning level 29, they will not be exactly 150 but must advance through
training the skill it is rounded to level 30 in general comments.
