LoL I feel you pain...I have a 51 druid and a 47 cleric.  As much as I like
to leave roleplay off, it never ceases to amaze me how many times I get
asked via /t for a port or a res without even being asked if I am busy atm.
Just be careful, as I try to do...I give everyone their chance and don't
automatically assume everyone is rude because one person forgets to thank
me...of course, all the poster in the bash the druid thread have had their
chance =) ....
