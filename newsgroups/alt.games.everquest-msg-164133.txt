Sure, let's do a google search.

We'll make it since the beginning of November, to keep the numbers
manageable.

I've posted 23 times, counting this one.

Humor = 3 (I'm slacking)
Informative or related to game mechanics = 8
Discussing ebay accounts in an informative rather than complaining manner = 5
Completely and bizarrely off-topic = 3 (If I'm kind to myself these may
qualify as humor)

Complaining about DT complaining about somebody complaining = 4 (counting
this one)

That's a 1/5 ratio.  My informative posts outnumber any posts complaining
about anything other than game mechanics (mostly you) by two-to-one.

Now let's look at your google...  179 posts.  Rather than sort through and
try to give a similar ranking, I'll just count up the ones that are
complaining about someone complaining or being a rules-monger.

...

Oh I give up...  I counted up to about 75 and still had more posts to look
at, but I really couldn't take yet another bandying of the rules or
complaint about someone complaining.

There's your ratio comparison.  I'll say 75 just to prevent myself from
looking at anymore of those posts.  1/3 ratio, being *very* kind.

Now, *why* would you ask if I'd like to make such a comparison?  Do you
really not realize how much of this stuff you post?

By the way, I like numbers.  I like them in game mechanics and I like them
in goofy little discussions like this.  I rarely lose on the numbers.  :P
