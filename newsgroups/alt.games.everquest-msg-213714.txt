I don't have room left for a DD spell when I am charming. Usually I have a
couple of DOTs, snare, root, camo, speed spell like SoW or one of the wolf
forms, animal fear spell.

I like to fear the target when my pet gets to ~10%. Soon as both target and
pet are well under 20% health I camo. That breaks charm and since both are
under 20% health and snared, they just stand there. I can pick and chose
which one dies first. If it works out right, the root does enough damage to
kill them and takes half the mana of the DOTs I have up.

I really need two DOTs to adjust the fight. I really need camo. I really
need root for those times when my pet just isn't quite dead enough and I
want the target to fight to the death vs. flee with my pet at 21% health and
ready to try and run me down.

Usually it is more like 5 or 6 things chasing me all over the zone due to
various resists + charm breaks + adds, so I have to do a drive by rootings
to get the experience for the one mob that took damage before my plan went
south.
