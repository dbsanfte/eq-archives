At paw spires people often cannot handle the spawn rate and let mobs stand
around waiting for them to med up.  I'd sometimes take the spawn and when
they complained I'd tell them "Don't worry by the time you get ready to
fight there'll be another one up".  One guy even threatened to report me
violating the PNP.  I told him "Go ahead the PNP means you have to share the
camp".  But their complaints eventually grew tiresome so I quit it and
camped the hill.  Now as a solo wizard I do have to med between fights,
obviously.  And I do it invised.  So eventually I got accused of stealing
the hill even though I was there first.  Some people seem to think that if
you are not camping in plain sight then you can't claim a camp.  I kept that
hill despite the complaints.
