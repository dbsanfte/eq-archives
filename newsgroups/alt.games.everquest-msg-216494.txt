If you're referring to the "too dangerous" message.... Current theory
is that means there are too many instances of that theme running at
the time you try to zone in. Sure, they thought that, while they
couldn't accommodate ALL the players, they could accommodate as many
as they would need at peak hours. They kinda underestimated the
popularity of the dungeons, it seems. :(

But that's just theory. They say the testers haven't nailed the cause
for sure. Good news is that leaving the mission before anyone enters
*shouldn't* cause a fail on your record...
