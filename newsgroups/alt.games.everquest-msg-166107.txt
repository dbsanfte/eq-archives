Did you bother to ask the numbnuts why he didn't get bound in Freeport? Of 
course he was probably part of the "gimme gang" (as my wife likes to call 
them) and never *had* to make a naked corpse run. I may be an old timer but 
I remember dying many times making the FP to Qeynos run (I still whack 
Broon whenever he's up) cause there were NO 'porters yet. That's really 
what's wrong with the game in my opinion. The latecomers (or old-timers who 
expect it) expecting everything handed to them "just cause you got it and I 
don't".
