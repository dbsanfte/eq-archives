Hrmmm.... I've never played a bard past level 4, so help me out here.
With warriors, our combat skills such as offence, defence, etc. reach a
cap around lvl 40. If any of them didn't manage to max out by then, they
would soon after. Don't most of the bards still melee in addition to the
old song and dance routine even up to/past forty? If that's the case,
then it should cap out on it's own. If not, then my mistake.
  I know that there are a lot of caster classes that will never max
those skills unless they go out of their way to find somplace to melee.
(Why I still hear Druids and Clerics asking about maxing melee skills
when they are in their forties is a mystery to me to this day.) But I
thought bards were still tanking a bit at those levels? No?
