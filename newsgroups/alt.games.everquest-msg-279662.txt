Fantastic. You seem like just the kind of player that would help make 
this work. I would hope we would attract many new players in addition to 
longtime veterans.

Drop me an email (you'll need to un-munge it, of course). I'll be 
compiling a list of those interested. Hopefully we'll very soon wind up 
with more than enough to get this started. At that point, I'll make 
arrangements for us all to get together and discuss some of the finer 
points.
