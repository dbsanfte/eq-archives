I Am The Storm
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

( - J. Bouchard - R. Binder - )

You scorned the love that I gave you
You lied now nothing can save you
Blue skies are turning to grey
I know the games that you play
Winds of rage they start to build
Too much madness will lay you under
The cards you draw don't help at all
Hear the sound of approaching thunder

When you see the clouds blacken
Remember you've been warned
No shelter from my fierce winds
Because, I am the storm

You'll hear my echoes of anger
You'll fear the roar of my thunder
Nightmares, confusion will come true
Aces and eights are the fate that you drew
Lightning bolts become my swords
When I pull them from the sky
Run my gauntlet of slashing rain
You won't survive to testify

When you see the clouds blacken
Remember you've been warned
No shelter from my fierce winds
Because, I am the storm
