I agree, at least for sub level 45 characters, but since the OP mentioned
twinking, he would get a lot of "twink effect" out of the C3.  As has been
mentioned before, a shorter time limit on C3 would kill its use in the sense
I mentioned.  Or to have it last for hours, but with the caveat that it
would dispel as soon as the recipient left the enchanter's group, would also
eliminate much of its use as a twink tool.
