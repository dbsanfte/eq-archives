True.  But my original point was that some people out there don't invite 
strange rogues into their group "because they PP".  Doesn't help that 
they're right ;p For awhile I'd ask other rogues in /tell "do you PP?" 
"Hell, yeah, pick em clean!".  *sigh*

> Tattle.. what do they say?

Something along the lines of "Stop! Thief! <Eiri>"

Sense heading and sense traps are mapped to my PP(or nonPP) hotkey.  I 
also have them and ID mapped to a hotkey for use when I'm upping pick 
lock (are you not raising that?).  Disarm, I keep forgetting to put in, 
but since it works, what, twice in one's lifetime... :p

I don't have problems with most melee skills - 1hs and 1hb are both over 
100 now, backstab is only barely 100, sadly.  Piercing, of course, is 
much higher.  And everything in DSP warps like mad.  All the time.  
Especially when I'm pulling.

Now THAT melee skill I can't get up.  But that's cause I still haven't 
nagged anybody into getting a pet to beat me up.

Um - doesn't level have to do with aggro, too?

Well, if it's not the above, I'd say that's why evade never works when I 
want it to :p
