For your pleasure :

Immanuel Kant was a real piss-ant who was very rarely stable. 
Heideggar, Heideggar was a boozy beggar who could think you under the
table. .. 
David Hume could out-consume Wilhelm Freidrich Hegel. 
And Whittenstein was a beery swine who was just as sloshed as Schlegel. 
There's nothing Nieizsche couldn't teach 'ya 'bout the raising of the
wrist. 
Socrates, himself, was permanently pissed. 
John Stewart Mill, of his own free will, after half a pint of shanty was
particularly ill. 
Plato, they say, could stick it away, half a crate of whiskey every day! 
Aristotle, Aristotle was a bugger for the bottle, 
And Hobbes was fond of his Dram. 
And Rene Descartes was a drunken fart: 
"I drink, therefore I am." 
Yes, Socrates himself is particularly missed; 
A lovely little thinker, but a bugger when he's pissed.
