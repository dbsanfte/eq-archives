Perhaps that's why I never meet them or clans like them, they all left to
play EQ :�)
I would say former, they may still play Quake but I doubt they would able to
compete at a level they used to (assuming they were any good) and also put
in time to get that far in EQ. Even having no life whatsoever, it would be
difficult to do both.

Yes I know a few good quake players who moved to EQ, Valore from United
Kingdoms was an excellent Q2 player as was Che, the leader (or founder, as I
am not sure he is leader anymore) of Innit on AB. RC and myself weren't bad,
either. AFAIK none of us have any serious ties with the game anymore. EQ is
a huge time sink and requires, even for a casual player like me, a degree of
dedication that will make something else in your life suffer. With any luck
it'll be something trivial like your loved ones and not something important
like Quake ;�)
