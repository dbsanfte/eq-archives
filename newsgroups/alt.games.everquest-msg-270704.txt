That would be great if that's the way it worked.  Unfortunately, it doesn't
work that way.  Folks research encounters before they even start them.  In
fact, it can be said that such research is required reading for many
encounters.

In WoW, I've never started a quest on purpose ... not once.  Every quest
I've done has been started by the same method, which goes something like
this:  "Hey, there's a NPC with a yellow exclamation point over his head.
Let's see what he's handing out."  Walk over to NPC, click on them, get
info, accept quest.  I've never researched any quests in WoW, nor do I
intend to.

I know quite a few people who won't play EQL (or EQ2) without having a
second box right next to them to be used for hitting the spoiler sites.

Anyone can cook when using a cookbook.  I much prefer the ability to stay in
game, pick up quests from any quest NPC I see, and have a reasonable chance
of staying immersed.

Mind you, with Blizzard's system I still get the fun of exploring .... in
fact, that's one of the things I'm enjoying most about WoW.  It's a new
world, and I don't know precisely what's around that next corner.  I'm
focused, I'm having fun, and I don't want to have to leave that to go to a
third party site to find out the precise loc of the particular NPC in all of
some huge zone (like Antonica)  I need to talk to to move the quest along.

To each their own.

FWIW, I've yet to come across broken quests in WoW, so I have no need of the
spolier sites for the reason you've outlined above.  YMMV.
