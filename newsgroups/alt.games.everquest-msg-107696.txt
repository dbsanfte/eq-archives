 Sure, if you're talking about new characters just starting out then
prices are an issue. I was talking more generally than that.

 So you get to the other end two minutes before me. Big deal. It's not
like I travel across TD three times a day. If you were thinking quicker
you could have just cited lessor succor. Gets you halfway across TD in
seconds!

 Go ahead. If I was over there it was with my guild. I'd hope they would
res me. I can't see myself being over there for any other reason than
ToV. Besides, it takes all of 15 minutes to get to CS from Thurg. 2
minutes to EW, 4 minutes to Kael. 2 minutes to WL. 6 minutes to SS. 1
minute to Fountain room with gate to CS. 

 I'll remember that next time I swim by some casters corpse in SG
because the seahorses saw through their invis and killed them. FD is
your friend.

 Depends on where you are. As I said earlier, in most Kunark dungeons,
at level 60 a runner will not bring back an add. I solo in Karnors, HW
and Sebilis all the time.

 For those people that see it that way, they play Druids. I'm guessing
most people who play monks are not feeling disadvantaged by most of the
things listed in the slightest. I know I'm not.
