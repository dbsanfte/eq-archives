Nope, its the biggest EQ dead issue. Of course things like increased
run speed and mana regain were dead issues also and we get them in
alternative advancement in Luclin. Oh, and horses was a dead issue.
Er.. and mana potions were a dead issue, we also got them with luclin
or around the same time (player made)

Think of it this way, it currently can't happen because the game is
not set up for it. They could have probably done it with an area in
Luclin with the dx8 engine upgrades and stuff if they wanted to, but
they did not. They could still probably do it in a further expansion
pack if they wanted to do so.

So the real honest answer is:

I don't know, but if they did it would probably require another
expansion which could be free (but I doubt that .. ;) )
