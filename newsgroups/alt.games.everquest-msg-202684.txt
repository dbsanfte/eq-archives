How often do you find yourself as the Main Tank of a group?  I play a
Warrior and my role in a group is to Tank and Taunt.  If you find youself in
a supporting role as assistant Tank then you should focus on STA and HP
gear.  Reason is that if the group is a  seasoned, well experienced group of
people then the healer will focus first on keeping the Main Tank of the
group alive and any back-up melee or caster as secondary.  Besides, you are
a Paladin and can heal yourself.  As a Warrior I focus on AC.  Since I will
be stuck out in front Taunting and taking hits I want a high AC.  Since you,
as a suport tank will hardly ever get agro from a mob if the Main Tank of
the group is doing his role correctly then having extra HPs either from
higher stamina or HP bonuses will serve you better.

Str is another item that you could focus on but not as much as HPs.  STR
will increase your atack rating a bit and help you carry more stuff.  Also,
it will help you hit a bit harder.  But there are plenty of buffs out there
that can put your STR to the max.  Very few that can max out your STA.  My
STA right now is 130 un-buffed and even with the best Shaman and Cleric
buffs I have not seen my STA above the lower 200s.  In contrast, my STR is
166 unbuffed and have seen it maxed at 255 when you add in the Shaman and
Cleric buffs.  A high unbuffed STA is harder to get than STR.  So go for
what is harder and the lower STR can be made up with the appropriate buffs.
