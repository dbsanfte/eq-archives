And thats a problem with Zone Alarm how? This was a discussion about how some
people can't get ZA to work for them with a given game and say ZA is to blame
and yet others can. Get a decent virus scanner and forget about it.

Curious as this is mentioned on SARC:

You didn't happent to install something like Beonex Communicator did you?

>Zone Alarm don't have a button for "Not just no, but HELL NO!!!"

Thats becuase Zone Alarm is a firewall and not a virus scanner/trojan
detector. ZA is doing it's job as it is denying it access to the net. Why do
you think ZA should detect a trojan/virus?

Hadn't read to the bottom of your post. So it was Beonex after all!
