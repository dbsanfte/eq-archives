Hmmmmm, probably not since bards don't get archery skill.  A frost
giant in GD was probably being kiting using the level 12 Brusco's
Boastful Bellow, which only does (level/2)+1 damage every pulse, so at
level 30 does about 16 damage every time it's sung.  Very, very
inefficient, and I've NEVER known anyone to use it as a serious kiting
method.  
A bard will generally solo one of three ways, fear-kiting,
charm-kiting, or chant-kiting.  Fear-kiting is possible at level 26
and charm-kiting at 27, though it's a bit dicey until about 30.
Chant-kiting is first possible at level 36 when bards get their second
target DOT, but not effecient until 46, when they get the third DOT.  
I did a bit of fear-kiting, hated it.  When it worked I felt like I
was cheating for some reason, and when it was resisted I was dead.  I
seemed to feel dead a lot more than I liked.  
Charm-kiting was a blast, practiced on gnolls in SK to learn it,
perfected it with cyclops in Rathe Mtns, then moved up to HGs.  I was
able to kill every single HG in Rathe solo and keep them cleared by
level 38, including the corrupted HG cycle.  I was also able to clear
and hold the Ice Giants in Everfrost at 40.  A well-played bard can be
absolutely overpowering on big, hard-hitting, melee mobs as long as
there are at least 2 of them and it's outdoors.  The bard sites that
joke about druids asking you to leave some mobs for them aren't
joking.
Chant-kiting is boring, but very very effecient.  All you need is an
outdoor zone with non-casting blue mobs.  Find mobs that don't have
any special resists, equip your best drum, and twist 3 DOTs.  If the
mobs run at regular speed, you just start out with selos to get a bit
of a lead, let selos drop, and run and DOT until they die.  If they
run at sow speed you can either buy sow potions or twist selos.  You
can easily do 1000hp/minute and since you have tracking to find
victims, you can kill up to 20 mobs an hour, solo.  You'll usually
mess up and get stunned and smacked around every now and then, so mix
in regen and afk time and you'll still do 15 an hour.  A hell of a lot
more than the 2 an hour or whatever you would do with bellow.
