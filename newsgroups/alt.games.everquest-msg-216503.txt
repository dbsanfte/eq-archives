I click off the mount icon with my mouse, but then I run 99% of my game
clicking things with my mouse, it just comes more natural to me than hitting
keys; even my hotkeys I generally access via mouse.  Moving the various things
I might want to click on close together, and shrinking the viewing window down
with the /viewport command so its not overlapping/overlapped by those things
helps me a lot, too.

At any rate, with the mount up, you can't interrupt casting; you can stop a
spell from going off by moving, but it will still take the entire casting
time.  Lose the mount, duck, unduck, resummon mount when you get around to it;
thats the only fast answer.
