What is your cha these days, and do you find it relevant as a charm class?

For that matter, how many zones actually have worthwhile charmable 
summoned mobs by the time you get that ability?  Is it just a one trick 
pony, used for BOT and nothing else?

Sadly, my utterly untwinked mage (OK< Tea and Lenny twinked me with 
several hundred points of Elvish, Ogre, etc., which are invaluable on 
FV... and much later Aru gave me a hunk of pp to put towards my lizard 
mount) already has over 200 INT unbuffed... only with my new set of 
Naggy resist gear am I ever back under that line, and even then only 
without KEI.  I haven't deliberately tried for int gear, but it is a 
factor to consider when pricing gear in the bazaar, and I seem to get 
most of the INT augs that drop as I don't see all that many int casters 
in LDoN groups with me and those who are there often have all the INT 
augs they can use.

I'd trade my grandmother for FT, in fact the only thing I wouldn't trade 
for FT would be my drogmar drum (I spent more cash for that than a 
solstice earring would have run) and my Torch of Alna.. both of which 
mean far more mana potential than a point of FT.  Hmm, and my mana 
preservation slot, DD boost slot, enshrouded veil... come to think of it 
there do seem to be quite a few things I wouldn't trade for a point of 
FT.  But my grandmother doesn't give me any mana, so she's out of there!
