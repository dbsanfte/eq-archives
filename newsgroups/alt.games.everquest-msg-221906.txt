Ok, I know how to do the quest now, but what the heck is a "slot"?
Can I actually open up the guy's inventory, and you're referring to
inventory slots (he only has 4?).

More specialized lingo.  I assume you mean "mobiles", which is what
the abers called opponents.

I'm fully convinced it was a bug.  Since I can get into and out of the
water easily now, and was able to do that easily before I hit this
bug.  The real question was if there was a way to force myself out.
Ie, in Morrowind there's a "fix" console command that randomly moves
your character a few inches, in case it was stuck in the scenery.  Are
there online personnel that I could have called for help?
