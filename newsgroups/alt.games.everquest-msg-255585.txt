you don't actually get any new recipes ... what you do get is the ability to
use raw GoD components. Even if your skills are over 54 it's worth doing the
GoD tradeskill quests ... of course if any of your skills are under 54 then
it's a good way to get them to that level for free. There are 4 stages to
each of the tradeskill quests iirc, I've managed to complete a set with 90
hand ins the one time I counted :) ... it's boring for sure but necessary if
you're going to tradeskill GoD stuff.
