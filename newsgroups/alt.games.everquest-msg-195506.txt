I started doing this a long time back, as mentioned in another post.

The trick is to put STA gear on when you bandage, because unlike HP
gear it changes only your max HP, not your current.  IIRC, the Crude
Stein, the best of the old-time vendor price enhancers, has like 10
STA on it, so I was often able to squeeze out one more bandage by
swapping it in (some weapons have noticeable STA also).
