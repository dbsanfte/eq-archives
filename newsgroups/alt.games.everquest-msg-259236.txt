Hey bro,

Saw you on necro.eqclasses.com the other day.

It is indeed a great site, with many people who know the ins and outs of
necromancy like no other.  There are also a bunch of idiots that relish in
flaming the simplest of posts.  Take it with a grain of salt and sift
through for the good stuff.

PM me there with any questions you have if you'd like.
