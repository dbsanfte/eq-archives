Not easily spotted, if you hadn't put it in a thread about inappropriate
names I'd not have thought anything of it, imo that doesn't break the rules
and if it was petitioned I doubt it would get changed.

Using the name of a famous person/character is not against the rules, using
Chan or Lee or Li as surnames wouldn't be against the rules as long as they
are not aligned with their own first names. I doubt if you used Akira
Kurosawa anyone would notice (I take it that is who you meant) except that
Akira might either be blocked (for the Manga comic/cartoon) or taken (due to
the same) call yourself Brandon Lee and you'll be forced to change it, call
yourself Lee Kwok Ho and I doubt many would notice and would a GM uphold it
if they did?
Obscurity will let many names slide.
