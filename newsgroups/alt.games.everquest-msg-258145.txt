I've tested dispelling myself (Cancel Magic) and buffs were taken down
randomly, heavily weighted towards the first few but regardless of the
order cast or duration remaining.

Just the other day I was helping a Cleric farm shards, and after a few
chromodracs all but one of my 8 buffs were gone, the only survivor was
Virtue in the #3 slot which lasted a while longer before succumbing to
the relentless stream of dispels (possibly lending some ammo to the
theory that the level of the buff spell effects its "resistance" to
dispel).  Oh, and I hadn't had a death in 4 or 5 play sessions, so
that seems unlikely to have anything to do with the results.
