Nope :) I don't have either of them, nor the money to buy one. The issue was that
I wonder which melee skills I should be training for later use of good weapons
and I wodnered if there's some kind of drawback of some weapon classes (i.e. if
bashing would be less good than slashing in general because of some immunities
or so). I guess EQ does not treat the different weapon skills different now .. apart
from the skill you need to use them. The MoSS appleals to me mainly because of the
low weight. I think I'll go for that then. I just never or rarely saw SK's with
non-slashing weapons, so I started wondering :) For training I'd need some mediocre
weapons of all skills, but with utterly fast delay .. any sugegstions there? I can
look that up on allakhazams etc, but it's hard to find out which weapons are easy
to get or popular.
