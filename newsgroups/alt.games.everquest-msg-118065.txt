Exactly.  It's a matter of not wasting the lives of the animals you live off
of, than entire hunting-a-species-into-extinction type thing.  No, the
animal's not going to no the difference, neither is the one you don't kill,
becasue you don't need to.  On the other hand, if it's living, and it
doesn't know it was marked for eatin', it still comes out ahead.
