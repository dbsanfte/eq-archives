Actually, Velious. KEI is often referred to as Clarity 3 (or C3). It's
an upgrade to Clarity 2 (ya think? ;-) ) as well as an int/wis buff
that has an extremely long duration (with proper focus effects and
AAs, over 2 hours, as I understand it). It's a level 60 group spell
which normally would be able to be cast on lower level characters if
not for a bug that allows spells that normally couldn't be cast on
someone by directly targetting them to be cast on them while grouped.
