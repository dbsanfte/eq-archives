raid is nice, albeit extremely buggy

bugs inviting some groups that only fixes when the group is disbanded

making people group leaders (so they can shrink, tl and whatever else other
people) meaning they then cant be invited to groups

Exp is absolutely and unbelievably attrocious

Having raid loot rules apply only for protected mode of the corpse seems
silly... the corpse should stay locked period, and if it takes 10 mins to
loot, so be it.. dont let anybody loot it until their name is added as a
looter - stop ninja looting once and for all

when leader disbands/goes LD, the next person to get leader spot seems very
erratic
