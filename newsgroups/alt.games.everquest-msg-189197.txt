I'd say go for the RAM upgrade to 768 MB as the game runs with the
current video card and RAM setup and increasing RAM should help with
game speed and should help the overall computer processing capacity.

With specials and such, you will probably find an inexpensive video
card fairly soon but the additional video ram would principally help
game play and not system stability and speed.

Just be sure that your MB can handle the large capacity memory stick.
