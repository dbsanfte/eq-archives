Be that as it may, natural selection is not evolution, it's only one of 
the possible mechanisms driving evolution. Confusing and conflating the 
one with the other is one of the creationists resort to in their 
worthless attempts at putting together a coherent-sounding argument to 
befuddle the unwary.

Evolution is as much a fact as anything else in science outside 
mathematics (even Newton's laws... it could just as well be argued that 
it's obvious and intuitive that heavier objects should fall faster than 
lighter objects, and so it must be God that intervenes to make them fall 
at the same speed). Obviously, the picture is not complete as to how 
exactly evolution happens. Myself, I have no problem with the idea of 
many other mechanisms supplementing natural selection.
