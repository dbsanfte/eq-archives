Any mead that is marketed with mulling spices and directions for how to 
do that doesn't deserve to be drunk. Chaucer's isn't even a good cooking 
wine.

I have 12 five-gallon carboys. I've had them all full at the same time 
with different types of mead. I'll let you imagine the wine cellar from 
there. I've never broken the 200 gallon per year per household with more 
than one person wine-making limit, but I've come close.
