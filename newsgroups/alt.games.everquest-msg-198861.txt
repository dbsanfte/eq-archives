Cisco ruled (Hell, mostly STILL rules) packet routing on the internet
for a very, very long time, even though their products were buggy and
their techs incompetant. They have gotten better in some ways, but not
others. Juniper and a few other companies brining out solid products
that could really perform as well, with mostly bug-free software, was a
big blow to them.

And I agree with a previous poster. Why should we blindly accept the
status quo just before 459,999 other people do? I want things to get
better, not stay the same. I'm not threatening to leave, or close my
account, or anything childish like that, but that dosen't mean I think
the way things are is how they should be. Patches with no warnings that
run three times the length of the claimed window is just plain wrong.
There is /no/ excuse for it, ESPECIALLY when EVERY patch runs hours
late. They either need to give more realistic projections, or do things
faster.
