Vanguard beta is *rumoured* to be opening for beta at around Q32005.

May not be your style, but Eve-Online was quite fun, did not play it for
long though (played EQ too much).  Would probably play it if I had the time.

But yer...aside from that, Vanguard is all I waiting for, only 'real'
upcoming mmorpg that I am aware of (aint had much time to browse either
though!).

Guild wars was quite fun, not much depth (only played weekend beta though),
soloable (can hire mercs),  can play sorta like a single player game, if you
choose, and also a grouping game.

Warning though, has mass instancing so stay away if you hate that.  For GW,
I think they did the instancing better than EQ2, YMMV.
