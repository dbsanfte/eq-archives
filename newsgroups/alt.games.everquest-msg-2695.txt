Specifically, of wolf and wood elven ranger ..... <g>

Now that I have been shown the light regarding the tailoring skill, I have a
question.  I've been playing my wood elven ranger in such a way that she's
never attacked a black wolf ... I had assumed that she would lose faction
with her guild by doing so (since it seemed to me that attacking wolves
would be contradictory to her class).  However, this line of thought is
really cutting in to her ability to work on tailoring since she isn't
harvesting her own wolf pelts.

That gets me to thinking ... am I overplaying her treehugging tendencies?
