OK, and when my shaman is soloing, how much downtime do you think he has?
At this point, soloing blues uses up something in the neighborhood of 60 to
100+ percent of my mana (Cannibalize is fun).  How long do you think my
warrior has to sit on his butt when soloing (Whether he won the fight, or
had to turn tail and zone)?  And you haven't explained why druids have
ports.  Maybe they though, wow, we'll give this eminently soloable and fun
class to play something to make him rich too?
