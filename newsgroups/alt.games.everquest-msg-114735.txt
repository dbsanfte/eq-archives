It isn't hard to solo if you don't mind being so bored you will want to
scratch your eyes out.

You get maybe 1 to 1/2 blue bubble per kill and there are a very limited
number of beasts you can pull solo. You have to kill the same monster 25-50
times per level and kill it for 4-5 levels. Most of the solo stuff doesn't
give faction which hurts when it comes time to buy or sell.

Since you are already in FP area I would suggest An Alluring Siren in Ocean
of Tears. Take the boat from FP to Butcher Block, jump off when you see the
last two isles just before you zone and swim to the one on the right. The
two sirens there will not assist each other and should be easy kills. They
should take you easily to 16.

From 16 up I like Lake Rathe. VI put a soulbinder in The Arena now so you
can get bound right next to the zone. Jonah Bucker is level 15 may be tough
for you at 16. You kill him to level 18 or 19 anyway.

From 18-19 you just kill the low con Aviak guards at the Arena entrance.
That should take you to about 24-25. Some people like killing Aviaks in OOT.
Personally I found the run to their isle with levitate boring and it would
probably be worse swimming with your pali. There is a high level that
wanders around checking the other Aviaks so you will die.

From there it is a short run to SK and the hermit. You may die there because
the hermit gets visits from Tesh Mas Gnolls and an occasional Werewolf. The
pp for killing him is pretty good so you don't mind the occasional death.
The hermit takes you all the way to 28.

From 28 up camps provide a bit of a problem in the Lake Rathe area. There
are giant skeletons in Rathe Mountains but they are mixed in with Cyclops.
There are the gnolls at the spires in SK but they have a wide range of level
from 25-30 so the high ones would wear your butt as a hat. You don't have
tracking, so the Bull Elephants are not an option. If you go to the aviak
village, you may get killer adds. Probably best to go somewhere else.
