You're in a 5-person group.  The group kills a mob, and you get X
amount of exp.  Then you invite a sixth member and kill another of
that same mob.  You're still going to get the same X amount of exp.

Because it's a computer program, and They Can Make It Work However
They Want.

> Or, does the sixth member not get xp?

The sixth member gets the amount of exp they would have gotten in
a 5-person group.
