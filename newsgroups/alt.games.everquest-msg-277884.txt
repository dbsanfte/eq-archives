Allakhazam and CRGaming (previously EQCasters) have help with this.  In the 
middle of the Lavastorm zone is a camp of Mercenaries.  They give faction 
tasks.  I printed the one for GOOD faction and the names you need for single 
person tasks are Mercenary Bitral and Mercenary Elanye.  Kanethus 
Forrestwalker, Bianca Galbraith and Boldger Bristlebeard offer single group 
tasks.  Upon completing the tasks you receive a token and some of the 
Crystals.  I believe you need to turn in five tokens to reach indifferent 
faction to be able to do the more advanced tasks.

I will cite my personal experience.  Background: Druid level 66 and quite 
timid.  I accepted a task to gather spider silks.  Said to self: those 
spiders are green and I killed lots of them trying to help someone with a 
task.  I can do this.  BUT, after killing numbers of them and finding no 
silk, I checked Allakhazam for what was wrong.  I needed spiders in zone 
other than Lavastorm.  Zone into Lavaspinner.  See a narrow path.  Track: 
see only blue mobs and only a few spiders from that location.  By the way, 
the task window did not divulge the task details until I zoned into 
Lavaspinner.  Decide to spend some time foraging.  Did not see any mobs from 
the place I had gone to, only a small distance into the zone... Went AFK for 
a few minutes.  Come back and see I am nearly dead... EVAC.  Some mob had 
wandered my way or I had been "trained" with one mob.  I abandoned the task.
