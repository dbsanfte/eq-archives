At 60, I was able to single the otters out of the camp with the exception of
around the Chief. You should harmony him or you get him too. As far as other
places, Maidens Eye where you can quad the lower lvl gorangas at zone in or go
do toilers around the lake. If you're really daring you can try to multi up in
Plane of Nightmare, lol.
