One hint - DON'T get Intellectual Advancement.  Some tradesfolk use this
when they want successes, since it increases effective level of skills
(skill success uses the same code as spell fizzles, so increasing effective
level to decrease fizzles works on tradeskill successes as well).  However,
if you have an effective skill higher than the triv rating of what you're
making, you won't get skillups any more.
