Okay, I thank you for your answer. And if anyone else has anything relevent I'd
certinaly appreciate that as well.

Things I've done now that SEEM to have alleviated the problem.  
   
     Upgraded to DX 8.0a
     Upgraded to Detonator 3 Reference drivers

Hopefully this has fixed the problem, if not I'll be posting for more help. 

Thanks a lot,
    Russ
