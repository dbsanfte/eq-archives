I have been killing Frost Giants and Dire Drakkal Wolves like crazy and have
been on two raids to the Kael Drakkal Arena.  I ported to Cobalt Scar and
conned a passing Drake and was apprehensive.  Can I safely use the Druid
Portal in Wakening Lands or will Wuoshi still kill me like he did a month
ago before I worked hard to improve my CoV faction?
