That's why you invis to get into position. Once you're there, the quest 
giver and all the other NPCs in the library are on merchant faction (never 
goes below dubious). You have to be indifferent to do the quest though so 
you open a trade window with your red wine and have an accomplice invis you 
(making you indifferent) before you hit trade. Invising yourself won't cut 
it, since you'll drop invis upon opening the trade window. A couple of 
rounds of this should get you up to indifferent and you will be able to 
hand in the wine unaided. This should fix merchant and guard factions, but 
you'll still be KOS to all the funky guild factions there (TheDead, Indigo 
Brotherhood etc), but at least you can shop if you know which buildings to 
avoid.
