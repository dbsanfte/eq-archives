Which means, eventually, they'll go away. If they don't have anyone to
annoy, they won't stick around.

Frankly, whether they're there and can't bug me, or just not there,
doesn't matter to me. Playing in an effectively d00d-free environment
is very nice. I've encountered very few terminal jerkwads so far on
AB, but I've met a lot of people who were great to adventure with. I'm
sure I'll run into some assholes soon enough, but if they're rarer
here than elsewhere, it's still an improvement.
