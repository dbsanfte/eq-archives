Only one I ever saw was when Faydedar invaded LOIO last year. It was total
newbie slaughter till a couple of guilds showed up and put him down. Then
someone looted the corpse that was not in one of the guilds and it turned
into a bitching contest and whine that one of the guilds should have gotten
the loot. Jeesh. I got in an fought Faydedar even though I was only in the
low 40s at the time. Got feared and even died once. A nice cleric was
ressing us so it was no big deal.
Slayed many Bloodgills with a Shaman partner as they marched into the newbie
area and up to the Cabilis city zone while waiting on some help to slay
Faydedar.
