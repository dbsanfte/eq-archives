Actually, I find the game more enjoyable without being twinked.  Sure, I've
twinked some of my own characters, but based on a conversation with a couple
of IRL friends, we started 3 new characters that won't accept or buy items
from anyone.

This particular character is 10th level, and I like my minotoar axe that I
got myself!  Oh, and that Shiny Brass Shield!  It really means something to
me for that shiny brass shield to be something more than an item to auction
for 10pp.  I've got a screaming mace somewhere in my future, or perhaps that
axe the Gnomish Warrior's Guild gives out?  Is it called a Bullsmasher?  Ah,
the possibilities!  The adventures!
