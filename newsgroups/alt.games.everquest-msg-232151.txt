Heh, I did the exact same thing when I put up my geocities site.  :)

Naw, don't bother.  But you can tailor your site to fit the requirements 
better.  Make the pictures smaller, that's the first step.  It also makes 
your site look a bit more professional.  You can also play around with 
whether to use .jpg or .gif, and/or how much jpeg compression to use in 
order to get substantially the same picture in a much smaller file size.

Your site is fairly simple, so that's the only real suggestion I've got.  
some people try to have sound files for a musical background or clever 
animations and whatnot that are massive bandwidth suckers.  But simplicity 
bypasses that problem nicely. :)

Fun site! I'm waiting for the story to go with your cute halfling friend.

}Thanks to all for the 100 hits

It'll clear up in a day or so, no worries. :) Generally, if you post the 
link in the newsgroup, the day of the posting you get 3,694,237 more hits 
than usual and it overloads, but then it resets again in a day or so and 
you're good to go. :)
