Actually, probably not.  Why do they ban trademarked and
copyrighted names specifically rather than just include them
under the non-fantasy exclusion (switchblade, etc.)?  Even with
their own examples, what's the difference between switchblade
and Kleenex that makes Kleenex higher on the list of 'bad' names?

Sony has a duty -- since they own the world and the characters
themselves -- to stop trademark or copyright infringement.  Those
rules surely came -- in part -- from their legal staff.  Enforcement
may be lax, but the rule is there to satisfy their lawyers.  And
there's nothing in trademark/copyright law that says "it's okay if
the mark is obscure."
