Soloing i tend to mele if im in a area of wanderers where perhaphs a add may
evenutaly assist the mob you been killing.

Additionaly at lvl 45 have saved up about 1 to 2k for some elder spiritist
vambraces handy low level dot  to assist when your thrashing the mobs. If i
know that a add is very unlikely ill just sit med and reapply  es dots till
dead.
