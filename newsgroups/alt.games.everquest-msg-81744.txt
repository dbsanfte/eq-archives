This isn't a beastlord issue, it's a pet control issue.

The same thing happens with the other pet classes, it's just a matter of
them learning to control their pets.

I deal with it by not trying to re-mez the mob that the pet attacked.  If
the mob's on the pet, it's not on the party.  I call this pet-mezzing.

Just keep an eye on it and be ready to remez if the pet dies.  And if the
pet keeps dying, then they will have an incentive to control it better.
