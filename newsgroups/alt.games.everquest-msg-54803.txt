Whoah there, bizbee.  You really seem to be pretty jacked there about my
Usenet protocol violation.  My apology for breaking the rules was genuine.
I really am fairly new to Usenet, but really, I do not think what I did was
the heinous of a crime.  People seemed to follow my post OK.  I will
certainly do better in the future though.  I did take a jab at your
"confusion," but I feel this was justified in light of your hostility
towards me.   Are you just a big ball of rage or what?

You project this idea that you are somehow the superior Usenet user, but
your post seems to be filled largely with expletives and comments about
jacking off and potential birth defects on my part.  And you compare me to
12-year-olds?  What's next, "doo-doo head" comments?  If so, I will brace
myself for more of these ad-hominem assaults.

Ultimately, I am sure your resent me because I stated my opinion regarding
your hobby, and it was not a positive one.  But hey, I have admitted that I
had no business telling people what to do, though my opinion of EQ stands.
And ultimately, I stated an opinion, which while hugely unpopular, was
topical.  I do not see how you can begrudge me that.  Attack the position if
you will, but attacks on me will not further your cause or make you look
intelligent.
