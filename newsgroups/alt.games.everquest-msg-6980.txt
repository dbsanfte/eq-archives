Well, I feel foolish for doing this, but here we go.

You want him a *good* sheild, one that looks pretty cool in the
process, run down to Thurgadin, into Icewell keep.  On most servers
there will be large guild raids going on here all the time, killing
the dwarves by the droves.  Most all of the guards carry Velium Round
Shields, those transparent shimmering round ones with the dwarf
insignia in the middle.  Since they're lore, and it's remarkably hard
for these guys to sell in Thurgadin in the first place, most of these
are left to rot away.  Meaning, if you act all polite and such, you
should be able to easily loot one.

Failing that, if you look around Thurgadin vendors enough, you can
probably find some on sell on them for about 40 plat or so.
