Two of the officers in my guild are of the opinion that aside from
possibly the bard, the most over-powered class is the BST. Slows,
Heals, Buffs, (as diluted as they may be) and a very strong Pet.

If that was all, I'd say the Necro still has the edge, but the BST
gets a combo Regen-Crack! Where the hell did that come from?

They both have played Necros to mid 50's on other servers, and one is
playing a BST now.

I'm of the opinion that while a Necro may have the edge in power, in
the late game they have to pick their targets very carefully, based on
what can be feared reliably. Whereas a BST has a lot more options on
what he can take.

I haven't played a BST before (they came out after the last time I
quit) so I don't have any direct knowledge, but I'd say as long as
they can pick a mob that dosen't kill them before they can slow it,
they should be able to outlast just about anything, as long as their
dog/cat/lizard can keep agro. (And they don't seem to have much
problem with that.) I can say as a Shaman, once I slow a mob, and get
my pet healed up, and then pick my cast times well, I can Slow and DoT
the mob without my pet losing agro. Hell my pet keeps agro better than
some tanks I've grouped with. (Which is kinda sad. =) Once that is
done, most mobs drop like stones. The way I used to solo the IGs in
Everfrost was, Long Root, Slow, Weaken(melee), Weaken(resists),
DoT(Disease), DoT(Poison), Pet, Fast Root, Wait and Re-Root as needed
until pet get's agro, Melee once Mob starts to run. That may not work
for a BST, but their pet should get agro a lot faster and hold it
better than mine.

As a possible help to the poster, look for somewhere where the mobs
don't hit too hard but have a lot of hit points. You should be able to
out last them with your BST Crack.
