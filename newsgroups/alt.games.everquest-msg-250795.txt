Thanks Ben. That gave me all of the info I needed to get it all
straightened out. Working for me now.

Oh, and watch when ya fish off the pier in South Qeynos... might get
a chance to work on those swimming skills. :-) I moved one character
down the pier, and was fine until I had the character sit. Fell off
the pier. Other character, earlier login, sat in about the same
location, worked fine.
