You're missing something essential here, the OP had the opportunity to
leave that group and not have to group with the other guy.  By staying
he accepted the other's behavior and committed himself.  If he were
a mature person he would have gone into tells with the group leader and
outlined his problems with the other person.  It is up to the group
leader then to straighten him out.  If that failed, the OP should have
left.  Leaving in huff and logging was the action of an immature little
prick.  As I've said in other places, it would never have gotten that
far in one of my groups - as I wouldn't have tolerated that sort of
behavior.  My groups have always been ML, roll for nice items and split
cash while providing 'dots to the cleric.  But by not trying to resolve
the issure before stranding the group with a dead member and no cleric
he became a poor groupmate I'd never have in one of my groups or on a
raid.  As a guild officer I'd never approve his membership and I'd
make sure my allied guilds didn't take him either.
