congratulations in proving your complete ignorance of facts, and the
desperate need for information. I'd *much* rather have Sesame Street
teaching my kids about tolerance, than your in-informed stupidity.

>Whats mommy gonna tell them? 

Maybe: It's a very serious illness that some people have. The illness is
in their blood, so unless you get their blood into a cut, you won't get
it, and even then it's unlikely. They're probably very sad they have the
illness and need friends as much as anyone else.

>- well
>son, it happens when you stick your pee-pee in Johnnys little ass.

Or maybe Johnny's mom had a blood transfusion in hospital during birth
complications. Or maybe Jonny's dad was a bad boy on a business trip and
slept with an infected prostitute before he was born. Or maybe Johnny
had an accident and was treated with infected blood in hospital.
