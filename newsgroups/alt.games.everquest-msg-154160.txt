This is one of those abilities where it's astounding that
Verant couldn't have foreseen the possibilities of abuse the
moment they conceived of it.  (I like the fix, for what it's worth.)

Another one with almost identical problems was the Paladin
spell, introduced with Luclin, "Thunder of Karana" (level 49).

As originally released, this spell allowed a Paladin to cast
a "silence" spell on a mob which lasted for a short time
(6 seconds, IIRC) during which any spells cast by the mob
would fail because of the "cone of silence".  The RP rationale
for this spell was that we were calling on Karana to bring a blast
of thunder so loud it would drown out the spoken invocation of the
spell.

The spell had a recast time of about 18 seconds or so, so at best
a Paladin could knock out about 1/3 of a mob's spellcasting.
Very useful, but not overpowering.  Paladins were overjoyed,
not only because they'd have a fun new ability, but because it
was something unique that would give us an indispensable role
on big raids (i.e., an actual *reason* for people to say,
"let's make sure we include a Paladin" -- every class should
have at least one ability which makes them uniquely useful
on raids.)

Except that...  What happens when you have 3-N Paladins chain-casting
this?  Suddenly the mob's spellcasting is canceled 100% of the
time, which is obviously *too* powerful.  (Again, how could
Verant *not* have immediately foreseen this?)  It also didn't help
that through bad coding, the spell didn't just shut down
"normal" mob spellcasts, it also blanked out dragon breath blasts,
and all other sorts of "special" magical attacks.

So out came the Nerf Bat, cranked up to "11".  It would have
been nice if some form of this unique and useful spell had been
retained, perhaps fixed in the same way as the Manaburn spell
is being fixed -- make it so that only one can land on a mob
over a given time period, thus eliminating the "overlap" problem.
(And, of course, make dragon breath and such immune from the effect.)

In the words of the immortal John Belushi, "but NOOOOOOooooooOOOoooo...."
Instead they immediately ripped this cool new spell out of the game
entirely, and replaced it with...  A wimpy, tiny, long-recast mana
sieve which no Paladin I know has ever bothered to actually use.

In the Paladin community the hope was that this was just a "quick fix",
and that the spell would return in some semblance of its original
form after Verant found the time to fix its original problems.
Nearly ten months later, we're still waiting...

Sigh.
