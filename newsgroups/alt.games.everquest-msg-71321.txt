Well, well.  Has Dark Age of Camelot single handedly forced EQ to listen to
its playerbase?

If I could go back 3 years and quote every "no way in hell" response from
Verant regarding the auto-binding issue, this email would be 5000 lines
long.

Re: the rest of the stuff, what a coinky-dink.  Just in time for the fishing
contest.  Um, yay.

I really wish they'd hurry up and fix the bugs that were listed yesterday by
Verant.  I'm tired of not having any sound, for example.
