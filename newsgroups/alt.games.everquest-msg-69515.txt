The Daytime PH can be a Bear, fire beetle, wolf, large rat, or mangy rat.

Nighttime PH can be any of the skelly-types.

If I get the time later, I'll post the official strategy to camping Pyzjn.  
These are all facts, no speculation.  I've killed her 35 times, I believe, 
and got 4 GBS in the first 32 ( or 31, don't remember now ).

The only thing random about the Pyzjn spawn is whether or not She will 
spawn, Varsoon will spawn, or a PH will spawn ( except during the "day", it 
will always be a PH ).

Varsoon is much rarer than Pyz in my experience, seeing him about 4 times 
to the 35 kills of her.

She can be level 13 and 14, and maybe 15.  I was in my late 20's when I was 
killing her, so I had to go off of what other people said the con was when 
I was killing / charming / toying with her.

I -still- believe there is an unsolved quest with the Pyzjn / the GBS / 
Varsoon ( or his undying form ).  I've charmed Pyzjn and talked to her, but 
haven't charmed Varsoon, yet.  Now that I am higher level, if I ever get 
the urge to do the camp again, I will charm Varsoon to see what he has to 
say.
