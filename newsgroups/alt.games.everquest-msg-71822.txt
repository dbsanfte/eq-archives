I made a post to the Dev forum requesting that they someday get
around to making it possible to install/deinstall the updated
zone textures on a per-zone basis, instead of the current
"all or nothing".

First, that would be a boon to players who didn't have enough
disk space for *all* the new textures, but who wanted to update
a few zones that they spend a lot of time in.  Or you could
swap textures around, installing them for the zones where
you're hunting this week, and deinstalling them from the
zones you had been hunting in but now won't be revisiting much.

Second, it would make it easy to check the updated textures
on a "trial basis".  If you like them, fine, if not, deinstalling
would be reasonably painless.

Finally, you could mix-and-match the old and new textures, so
that you could use new textures in the zones where you like the
look of the new textures better, while letting other zones
keep their "classic" look if you preferred.
