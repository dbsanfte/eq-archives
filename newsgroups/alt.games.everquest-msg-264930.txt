Well if your PC is running at balanced graphic mode and your starting for
the first time, you should get your first character on a ship sailing in the
ocean, this a short and fun little tutorial which gets you slightly familiar
with the basic's.

Once you hit the island you should know how to do combat, have most of your
settings tweeked and be in awe of what you just experienced for the first
time on the ship, the island is a little less exciting but a worthy training
ground as EQ2 plays nothing like EQ1 really.

Point & click with a gui that rivals any game of that style today, with very
little typing except to maybe converse with another player, unless your fast
enough to use all the great little emotes.

Once you have leveled to a reasonable character level which is capped at
level 6 until you get your citizenship in either Freeport or Qeynos, you
will then leave the island on that journey and it's then you will see a
massive differance between EQ1 & 2.

If you create more characters (Max 4) after that to experience you can skip
the ship tutorial and go directly to the island, not recommened for the
first time if you can even do that I forget.

Todate I've played 6 different types of characters and of all my favorite is
still a Scout - Preditor - Ranger, magic classes are second and pet control
for mages still blows but isn't hopeless.

Tanking is a new experience as the warrior will be clicking various buttons
as often as a magic class to get the Heroic bonus attack damage in being a
huge differance from just swinging away in EQ1.

In overview of my first time I can say it was a little overwheming from
playing EQ1 for 4+ yrs, but you'll get used to it by around level 10 if your
an average player.

In my opinion there is still plenty of things which need addressing
especially tradeskilling as it's a vastly different system from EQ1.

I don't know how they can go with a Nov.8th. release but it's not unlike it
was when EQ1 first came out unpolished still playable.

Will I be buying it, yes because of all the MMO games I've seen or know of
todate it's still the King and probably will be for many years to come.

Will I go back to EQ1, nope, it feels out of date once you've spent any
large amount of time in EQ2.

Cya, Have fun!
