    I believe that a player from Tallon Zek once said it best: "As long as
we're imagining that the other person is female, it's all good."

    We had a quiet mage in our group recently who then confirmed what we'd
been wondering when she sent the group her cyber tell by accident. Nothing
like seeing "running my fingers through my pussy" in group chat to liven up
shard camping.
