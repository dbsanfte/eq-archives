Can't be handed down, it's all No Drop.

And yes.  On E'ci at least, beginning probably around 47 or 49, you could
get on a public Kael Arena raid, and win Thurgadin quest armor.  After 55
you can begin going on public Halls of Testing (Temple of Veeshan) raids to
get Skyshrine quest armor.

Etheral Mist armor (Cleric planar armor, from Hate)  is relatively easy to
get.   Once you're beyond that, Thurgadin and Plane of Growth armors are
better sets.  Skyshrine and Kael armors are a step above those.   Some
player made armors are equivalent to Skyshrine / Kael, but expect to pay an
arm and a leg for them.  (They are difficult and time consuming to make, not
even counting the enourmous time investment to reach the skill level
required to produce them.)

After that, there are no real sets.  You will upgrade one piece at a time by
gathering 30 or so of your closest friends to kill a single ubermob.  (1)


(1) - No, Plane of Mischief armor does not count, IMO.
