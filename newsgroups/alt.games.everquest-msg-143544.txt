In addition to the others here, dont forget that you need to pick you
camp/mobs carefully. Pulling 6 of anything can kill even then best groups.

Also get used to grouping for the fact group is *absolutely* required for
most of the serious raid level and end game type stuff. There is a learning
curve with grouping (as the warrior demonstrated) but you seem to be asking
all the right questions and will learn the dumb group from the good ones.

Good Luck and Good Hunting!
