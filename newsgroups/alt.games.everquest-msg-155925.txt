The sharks are pretty much screened out and kill rarely, the spiders have
antivenenes available (not much good if you are outback, perhaps, but most
aussies live in the city and barely know there's life past the burbs) (and I
speak from experience when i say the bite of the funnelweb can be painful
but not necessarily fatal, even without treatment), the crocodiles harvest
the people ignoring the signs saying there are bloody great crocs about so
don't even think about swimming and only rarely stroll the streets of
Darwin, and the octopi are usually only dangerous when you poke them with
sticks, like I used to do. (they don't go blue unless they are asking you
nicely to stop. They can't eat you and just want to sit in a warm rock pool
and live a stick-free existence).
