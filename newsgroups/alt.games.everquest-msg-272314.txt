I'm still baffled by this. What the fuck version of EQL were you
playing where soloing was less of a grind? Not the version me and
everyone else I know played.

Uh, no it's not. Orange is a step before red, which would make it
"high yellow" in EQL.

Now, granted, I'm only approx level 20, but I have yet to find a
problem soloing. Maybe it gets worse later, but I find it tons easier
than EQL.
