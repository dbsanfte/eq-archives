Usually when that happens to me it's because it can't connect
to the EQ site.  Either my network is being flakey, or ZoneAlarm
is blocking access.  (Even if I've previously approved access by
the patch-patcher, the patcher, and EQ itself, I have to grant
access all over again any time they change.  If I weren't such a
cheapskate I'm told the "paid" version of ZA lets me designate
programs as "okay even if they are modified".)

I'd suggest you check whether your laptop has ZA or some similar
program that monitors network access and might be blocking the
patcher.
