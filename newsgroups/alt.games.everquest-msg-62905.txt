When I first used a computer, it was a Mac.  I've worked with Macs for
fifteen years and only used a PC for gaming at home.  Also, every now and
then, when something went wrong, I'd bring in our home PC to work and ask
our resident tech-wiz to take a look at it.  Now that I've changed jobs, I
can't do that anymore because we've subcontracted the workstation and
network maintenance to a bunch of consultants who don't have time to piddle
around with my clunker.

Therefore, I've never updated a driver or ever seen it done.  Heck, I don't
even know what sound card we have on board!

Would anyone know of a few good sites where I could learn the basics, please
(the perspective of not playing for the next few weekends is unbearable)?

Until Santa shows up with our new 1.6 gig Athlon (512 meg RAM and 64 meg
Gforce 3), this is what I know about what we have to work with:

Pentium I MMX
128 meg RAM
8 meg Voodoo (Banshee or Rush -- not sure) video card
Unknown integrated sound thingie
Motherboard of unknown origin (never thought the brand or model # would ever
matter -- can't find the user's manual either)

Also, is there an easy way of finding out what we have under the hood
without taking the whole thing apart and using a magnifying glass?

Thanks in advance!

Dunce (an old, pc-illiterate fart)
