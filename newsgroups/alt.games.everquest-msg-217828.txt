Read the OP...I didn't get a failure that I didn't want...we completed the
dungeon within the allotted time, but I did not get the points.  Kind of a
moot point at this point in time as I've moved on.  Mainly, my problem was
that knowing that they have this bug, SOE wouldn't do anything about it.
Rollback is not necessary to give you credit that you deserve.  I didn't
like the little blowoff answer that he gave me of "We can't do anything,
sorry."
