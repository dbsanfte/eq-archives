Reading everyone's comments, it appears everyone thinks these
requirements are not reasonable.  I honestly don't know if they are
reasonable but I can tell you that at least on EMarr, most or all
raiding guilds have recruiting guidelines such as these.  An
exceptional player might be invited despite the low or "closed" need
for their class but generally they only want so many of each class.  I
think the idea is to build a good group of regular raiders who do more
with less.  the more people you add to your raids, the more lag, the
more confusion, the more thin you stretch the loot, etc..  Unless your
strategy is zerg, zerg, zerg, perhaps it is best if you only have so
many of each class.

I guess my point is that I dont know what is reasonable but I do know
that this is not at all uncommon.  Now if I *did* have an issue with
these recruiting standards it would probably be that raiding Antonica
mobs doesn't require anywhere near the coordination and planning that
raiding Anguish does and at this point, open recruiting isn't such a
bad policy.
