The servers have just gone down at 11AM for a 4 hour patch. It was 
announced a couple of hours ago in the game but it still seems to say 
that the servers are all up on the login page, and I've not found a 
status or patches page on the website yet.

Just in case you install it and wonder why it's not working :)
