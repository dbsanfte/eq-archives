I would like some help setting this up myself. I know it's in the
eqsupplement.txt or whatever that's called, but if anyone's already done
it and has a shortcut, that would be great. I have about all hits and
spells turned off in the option settings.  If I can move my hits out to
another window, my chat window may actually be usable during long
fights. Is there just one handy-dandy command line I can type in to make
that happen?
