Only way to do it now is take up a slot where a bag would be and take
up a hot button.  If it were up to me we would just have a scaleable
number of hotbuttons...as many as you wanted on the screen.  8 per page
is not enough.  But at least we will get this.

Ranger:

1) Switch from 1h to epics to get a mob ghetto slowed
2) Switch out both to DPS weapons to melee
3) Switch to 2h weapon to tank
4) Switch back to both epics, or at least Swifty to use the bow
5) Switch to proc weapons to fight high mitigation mobs
6) Switch bows to root/shoot, since you put a DD proc on the other one
etc...

There are guilds out there that don't require a single minute of time
commitment...They aren't all raiding guilds.
