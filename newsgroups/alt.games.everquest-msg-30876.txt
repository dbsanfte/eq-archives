I worked a dark elf necro up to 8 - and I loved him.  Him and that pet would
leave piles of corpses it seemed.  The thing is that dang pet.  I play a
druid now exclusively and work with pets 'kinda' when I charm them.  I must
have taken out 3 or 4 borer beetles in NK last night with one Griffawn,
before it finally turned on me (hey, those lions run as fast as my SoW!!!!!
what the?).  That kind of pet I enjoy as it's not the main focus of my
druid - and my druid has mobility WAY beyond what I understand the normal
necro has.  With the necro, it seems like its a team of 2 - always, and I
just didn't like being burdened with a pet when personally I just love to
explore new areas and con/kill new things.

So yeah, you should play a druid =)
