Oops,sorry.

Too late for me,I wont buy any other expansion(s),they totally messed
up the balance in the last year with the sole purpose to make players
buy more expansions.
Had today a barely 67 Enchanter with no AAs in guild complaining,
one of the monster missions took too long for the reward,which was
some int caster gloves with 95 hps,other stats accordingly,mission
took 1 hour.If I understood him right,he thinks a proper reward would
have been if all party members would have get a comparable reward.
