Um, no.  You got so many facts wrong it's a Fn joke.
We've been around each other in BW for about four or five years now.
BW is a NG about AirWarrior and it's community members.
We tell Mage he sucks on a daily basis, we also, like him.  I remember when
Mage got Moggy's job...

Why am I trying to tell anything to a dick like you?

You want to fuck with the AirWarrior community?
You'll get bitch slapped so hard you'll spend the summer in mamma's lap.
