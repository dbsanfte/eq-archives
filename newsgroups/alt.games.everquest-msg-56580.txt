This is very very false.  In addition to having played up a
number of characters over the past couple years, I've
currently been playing a druid, and specifically been
fighting in South Karana (which I think you'll agree is
an old world zone)

Out of sheer laziness (like my spell list the way it is, and
hate having to swap in Harmony for the occaisional
pull) I've been Root pulling from the two aviaks at the
bottom of the ramp, and in the first hut up the ramp,
and those out in the two freestanding huts.  Root one,
run, switch targets to the other, snare it, and kite away,
heading for the Hermit.  As long as root holds for just
a short while, I never have to worry about that other guy
heading my way and catching up, despite the fact that
I'm moving at snared rate... because I keep having to
stop and wait for my victim.

They don't forget me entirely, like some velious mobs,
if I gate back to the ramp without camping to clear aggro,
I'll have to deal with the mob I rooted (assuming it
hasn't been killed by someone else in the meantime, which
it usually has)

Too, I occaisionally pull an add, snare it, run off with the
other a good ways before switching targets; if I've gotten
enough range up before snaring the other guy doesn't show
up, and if its just a rook and I'm only kiting a harrier, or
vice versa, I'll go back and pick up my original target, who is
still on my track, and noticably moving in a direction not
towards me.  This is not just Aviaks, works with Centaurs
and Gnolls too, same zone.

Hunting in Oasis, a bit longer ago, I've definately run out
of follow range from crocs and orcs, this time not on purpose,
trying to get em back to my partner.  SOW on me, snare
on the target, and I've got to pay a little attention to make
sure I've still -got- the target!

If a pack of orcs are beating on an ex groupmate, and
I've got SOW or better, I think there's very good odds
they aren't going to cross a zone looking for me once they
get thru picking their teeth with his remains.
