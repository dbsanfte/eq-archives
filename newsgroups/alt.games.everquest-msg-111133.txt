Gone to Rocky Point for a couple of days and I miss all kinds of good
arguing.  Damnit.

Anywho, I think the problem many people have (including myself) with
christianity in general is that it isn't logically consistent.  The
god of the new testament doesn't really seem to be the same guy as the
god from the old testament.  Seems kind of a stretch that he went from
the wrath of god type (pun intended) to the love thy neighbor god like
that with no on screen character development.
