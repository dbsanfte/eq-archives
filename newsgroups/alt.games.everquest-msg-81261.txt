Well, that's a nice change, at least.

Staying up 24 hours?   Which part of "a killable version of Zordak will
appear
independent of the pearl turn-in every few days" did you miss?  Now you get
to watch for the merchant version of Zordak to spawn (once every 24 hours)
with every other cleric at that point of the epic and compete to see who can
turn his pearl in the quickest -- he spawns, gets the pearl from someone and
despawns.  THEN you can watch for the killable version to spawn and compete
with every other cleric who has only that piece to do yet to muster forces
to kill him *as well as* every quild capable of killing him who might want
his
other possible drops like a scale for the warrior epic and a Cloak of
Flames.

So, no, they *added* another bottleneck.  Now you get to wait for not only
the merchant version to kill to spawn Zordak but also a merchant version
which despawns after turn in.   And, believe it or not, the killable version
no
longer is the final step:  you can do it at any point, since it doesn't have
a
turn in trigger.   So now guilds capable of killing Zordak (53+, right?) but
not Chardok can compete for him too  So you don't have to have a cleric
at the final step of the epic to want to kill him;  you can justify killing
him
simply for the heart drop (it's independent, remember) for any non-epic
cleric *and* the other possible drops.

Unless I'm missing something, this quest just got a *LOT* worse.
In fact, I don't see where they "fixed" anything except the possibility of
spawning Zordak and losing your pearl by being KS'd.  And the changes,
unless they removed the normal drops from Zordak, pretty much ensure
you WILL be KS'd if possible...
