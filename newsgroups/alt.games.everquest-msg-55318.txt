When the shit hits the fan is when the enchanter goes to work for crying
out loud. It's why we're there in the first place! Gah!

AE mez doesn't cut it at 16 when we get it. It's there strictly for
emergencies and if the enchanter is depending upon it, the enchanter is

And the enchanter will simply walk up to the mob(s) and completely shut
it, or them, down. Chain casting the color series will completely shut
down anything that can be stunned - even if the mobs can't be mezzed.

You have gained party experience!
