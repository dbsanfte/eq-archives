If you can't play the game, but intend on upgrading in the future, cancel,
reactivate when you have upgraded.  If you have no intention of ever
upgrading, cancel, ask for a refund, be done with it.  Yes, in the latter
case, your account and characters will be deleted, but since you don't plan
on playing, what difference does it make?  If, OTOH, you do plan on
eventually playing, then you stop paying for it for now, and start again at
such time as you can play again.

Did Verant fuck up here?  Absolutely, no question.  Have they offered
affected people a way to recoup their expenses?  Yes.  All they have done is
tell people that if they do not want to play anymore due to a lack of
desire, or ability to upgrade, then they can get a refund, and their
account, which they will not be using anyway, will be deleted.  If these
people would like Verant to maintain their account, then all they have to do
is not ask for a refund on the game, they can stop paying the subscription
cost for now, and their account will be maintained so that they can
reactivate and play again.
