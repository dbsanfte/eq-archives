I've recently been enjoying playing the market, finding useful tradeskills
and selling off my junk. However, my girlfriend has a nasty habit of logging
my trader out when she get's up / comes home (it really does slow the
computer down). Anyway, sometimes I'd like to check to see if I sold
anything, (and who to), but can't without logging in (and even then I don't
find out who to). So to complete this unnecessarily long question, is there
any way to log what comes up in your Trader window?

Cheers
