Just based on personal experience with my shaman, I can say that without a
doubt, debuffing and DoTing are big taunts vs DD.  If I Malise or DoT a MOB,
even after the fight has started, I will just about inevitably taunt it off
the tank, not for long fortunately, as the tank taunts it back.  Whereas if
I DD for 137 (I think that's my max right now), it is less likely to taunt
the MOB, as the tank usually has done far more damage than that already.  As
for the rest of the argument, I can't really say, I have only played an SK
to lvl 5 so far, and a Paladin to lvl 10 or 11.
