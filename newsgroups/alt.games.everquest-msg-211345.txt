Joining a guild isn't necessarily taking bold steps to separate yourself 
from the general population.

A Chinese immigrant living in a 'white' suburb might join a Chinese 
club... that by itself doesn't make him an isolationist. He might still 
get to know his neighbours, and integrate into society very well... it 
just means he wants to associate with other Chinese too, and he can't 
easily do that without making an overt action to find a Chinese group to 
join.

Similiarly when a Korean who is fluent in English joins a Korean guild 
its not necessarily to isolate himself from the general population, but 
its probably the best way to meet other Koreans...
