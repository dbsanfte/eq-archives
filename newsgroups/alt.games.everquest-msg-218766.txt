  Interesting essay.  I hope we get some good posts out of this until it
de- evolves into arguments and off topic chatter.

   I guess most people around here would call this crowd control?  I
would like to humbly submit that clerics should be here, perhaps last in
the second list.  From duoing several levels with a warrior, I have
learned that I can deal with an add or two without much trouble.  Simply
draw agro of the adds by either stunning or dropping a nuke on them, or
by casting a couple of biggish heals on the tank, and then when I get
agro root park them.  If the fight with the primary is going to last a
while, I can then atone them and watch them wander off when root wears
off.  Or, if I don't feel like getting agro for some reason, I can just
root the add(s) and then tell the tank to back up.
    Also, snare might be in this category as well.  If one can use it to
stop runners without taking damage during the running time, fights get
alot easier.  Hello druids, rangers, necros, shadowknights, and wizards.

   Also, I think I might want to look at a category for breaking camps
and pulling.  Having someone along that can do this well can make every
fight alot easier than if the group were forced to pull four or more
mobs at a time.  Here the feign death classes get a boost, as well as
clerics with pacify (since they changed the line, I pull alot) and too a
lesser extent harmony (since the nerf.  It used to be godlike.)
