Hi all.  I was recently excited to discover that wdespite being a
goodie race/class, with careful sneaking and harmony, I could indeed
turn in the sarnak war braids to Captain Rottgrime in OT to raise VS
faction.  I knew it might take many hand-ins to become amiable, but I
was determined, cuz I really wanted to get the OT gating hammer. 
However, someone recently told me that many factions are now "capped",
and that the best I can get is indifferent.  Is this true?  If so, how
does a capped faction work?  Does it take your race and class into
considration, then say, for example, that all Tunare-warshiping
rangers cannot become better than indifferent?  Was this always in
place or is this something new?  Thx for the info.

P.S. I was also told that puppet strings from Plane of Fear can be
used to charm the undead foreman, and that I could still complete the
quest that way.  Does this still work?  I vaguely recall something
about how charmed NPC's either just eat up or spit back whatever you
give them now.  Thanks for any and all info.  Also, where exactly does
one get them in PoF, how hard is it, and are they tradable or no-drop?
 Thx again.
