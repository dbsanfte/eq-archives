Its legit. The big sites are owned by IGE and they are a legit
business, albeit one that is against the eula. There isn't anything
"illegal" about it though.

Sony will never catch you if you buy from one of those sites.
They(IGE) have dummy accounts and pop up in some city and give you the
stuff, after your credit card/paypal transaction goes through.
Go read their websites if you want to find out more, but I'd only go
through one of the ige umbrella sites. They own player auctions, IGE
and my super sales.

The moral issues are moot, though a lot of people will pop up with
some false morality saying its bad for the  game and this and that.
Who cares? The game is some 5 year old crappy thing, big ass deal. I
don't care what anyone does anymore, it won't ruin the game as much as
SOE ruins it by not improving it. Little Johnny buying some plat is
small potatoes.
