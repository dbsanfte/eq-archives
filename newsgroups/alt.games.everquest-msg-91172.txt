	OK, can I ask question?  Are you either a) a complete idiot, or b) unable
to do math, or c) both?

	8,000 players * $40/month = $320,000/month

	392,000 players * $10/month = $3,920,000/month

	Quick, which of these two numbers is bigger?  If these are both revenue
streams for your company and you suddenly can only cater to one or the other,
which do you support?

	Do you have any idea how far your ass would be punted in a corporate
environment if you were to suggest that the company put its resources behind a
new product that wasn't going to bring in 10% of the revenue of the
already-established product you were advocating abandoning?
