Well, it wasn't *crucial* that he healed, but he and I were together
in a group without a cleric, so it helped ME to have him chip in on
healing the others in our group. Besides, he might be there some other
time where his healing  would be necessary, and it's good to learn
when to nuke and when not to nuke early on.
We haven't spent enough time in HoT to make it tedious yet, and we
don't have the numbers to make it trivial (as saturday's mishap
showed), so who gets the kills doesn't really matter as long as things
die and drop stuff for us and don't kill us instead :)
