A few ideas come to mind.  For a really easy raid at that level I would say
Crushbone, but tends to be camped a lot, so setting up a raid there could be
a bit tentative.

Others would be:

The Warrens in Odus (The Muglewump, various named Kobalds, etc)

Kurns would be really good.  Great feeling of crushing through tons of
things, chance to deal with casters, some crowd control, etc.  You could go
for the Undead Jester (drops Iksar Berserker Club sometimes), Skeleton Cook
and a few other targets.

Personally if you're trying to teach raid techniques I would put Kurn's at
the top of the list.  Tunnels can sort of wind around on the lower levels so
gives you the chance to teach sticking together, wandering can bring on
hella adds so good chance to learn that now rather than in Sebilis or such.
Various caster types, especially necros and Shadowknights (fun fun dealing
with Harm Touches).  Not too rough a zone especially with the backup you'll
have, but still offers a good learning experience at those levels.
