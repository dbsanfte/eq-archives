Well, its a long time since I was level 11 (been playing since april
1999 with one character, now level 55), but I was certain they started
off angry and gradually improved their likiness of me as I levelled
up, with the amiable bit only coming along once I got to a high enough
level for it not to be much use.

All I can think is that either a) the arrival of amiableness had nothing
to do with my level, and was patched in coincidentally around then, or
b) that I've been eating too many rathe mushrooms again ;)
