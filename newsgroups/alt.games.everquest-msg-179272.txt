Yea, I've been playing a lowbie bard alt a fair amount lately, got him all 
the way up to uber level 18.  I'm in a bandit group in paludal and sure 
enough "Hey!  You aren't playing manasong!"  I stopped and thought about 
that for a second, then as gently as I could said, "you mean the level 20 
mana song?"

}So sometimes you have to say, "yeah, I'll play manasong during
}downtimes" and then show them what you can do during battle (crowd
}control, charming, hasting, etc.)

.... Totally piss off the chanter ....

On my main I've been grouping with a couple different bards lately.  We 
really need to work on communication.  Nothing irks me more than locking a 
mob down for 54 seconds, and having it come over and start pounding me 
after only 18.  Of course, the bard had helpfully overwritten my mez, or I 
had tried to mez his pet, or what have you.  It would be lovely if we at 
least got a "your spell did not take hold" message, or "You can't mez 
another player's pet", or -something-.  But we don't even get the snazzy 
new "mez was broken by" message.
