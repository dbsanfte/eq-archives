I'm thinking about starting EQ after all these years...I've played other rpg's
but know nothing about EQ.  Some questions...

I'm a little confused about all of the versions.  Do you need all of the
updates to play or are those just for higher level players?  If not, which
version would you recommend most for a noob?

Is a high speed connection necessary?  How bad is it if you don't have one?

What's the best place to start out and the better characters to start with?  I
would like to be able to solo fairly easily.

What are some of the best websites for info?  There are so many I couldn't
begin to check them all out.  What are the most frequently used message boards?

Any downloads that would be really helpful to a newbie?

Would I be better off just waiting for EQ2?

I'd really appreciate any info about the game that would be helpful.  Thanks.
Alex
