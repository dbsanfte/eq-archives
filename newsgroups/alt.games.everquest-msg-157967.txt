This could get very annoying, couldn't it?  Take a long, close fight, deep
in a dungeon, where part of the party dies.  If the Clerics don't have time
to get reses off before 10 minutes, what happens?  Do they have to send a
Cleric back to the zone in to res, and then have a Mage CoH the Cleric and
the resed people back?  Does Mage become an essential class on PoP raids?

Better (assuming that the purpose of this *wasn't* to make it so that any
death on a raid is very annoying) would have been to make it so that /corpse
has unlimited range at the zone in.
