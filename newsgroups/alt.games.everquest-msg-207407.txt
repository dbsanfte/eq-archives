The magician would do just as well by themselves.  Monk can FD all he wants,
the very second he stands back up he's gonna be the one getting beat on. 
Magician pets simply will not take aggro from a player in melee range.

Believe me, magician and monk both to 65 with a lot of solo and duo work on
both.  As magician, I can't group with a melee until there's a healer in the
group, and as monk there ain't no way in hell I'd accept an offer to duo
with a magician.  :)
