Why call that cynical?  EQ is a very valuable product/service delivered
by a company that's in business to make money.  While a more likely
scenario is that there was an argument over whether the change would
adversely affect the game (adverse from their point of view being a
reduction in cash flow).  I'm confident that the post-50 group-buff bug
was left unfixed for such a long, long time for exactly that reason,
they were worried that fleeing twitch-kiddies would cost them too much
revenue.  I don't think that it's a coincidence that the group-buff fix
came so quickly after the release of Planetside.
