Um, all the changes to this point to the low level play made it easier, 
until they fixed the group spells.  It used to be that you always had to go 
loot your corpse from level 1.  It used to be that you lost xp to death 
starting at level 5 (or was it 4?).  You didn't used to have all these 
tips, you used to have to stare at your spell book in order to meditate.  
I'm sure there are other changes I could come up with given time.  What 
changes are you talking about that made low levels harder, prior to this 
change to group buffs?
