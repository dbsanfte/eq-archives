I see,  that obviously means you only date or have relationships with
butt ugly people right?Otherwise that would make you a  hypocrite for
saying it like its wrong.  How about taking what she said at face
value. That she is interested in  a guy who is into games like she is
that just because she is asking here doesn't mean she is going to give
up the oh so human prerogative to try and be with someone she finds
attractive.

Your reading comprehension is abominably low. Where does she mention
overweight at all in the above paragraph? She says she likes to hang
out "ie she's a homebody" then go out and stuff.

I think you sound like someone who has issues with a  woman who knows
what she wants and admits to having standards.
