Given how threads diverge, and how posts are not guaranteed to arive in
order on a news server, it's impossible to hold all the divergent
sub-threads in memory on a long thread.  (hint: the human mind can track
aproximately 7 things simultaneously).  Therefore, if you actually
want your post to be read and understood in the context you wrote it,
you assist your audience by quoting the relevant material right *BEFORE*
you respond to it.

Hmmmm, bottom posting works just fine in this.  Note how someone
getting this out of order can tell exactly what I'm responding too?
Of course, unlike you, I'm smart enough to place my response in
the logical place - directly *AFTER* the material I'm responding
too.
