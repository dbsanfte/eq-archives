So just where does a level 1 character get the 50-100 PP to buy KEI anyway?
Unless of course they're a big time twink, in which case they already have
so many unfair advantages going for them KEI really doesn't change much.

The low end game was already screwed out of proportion by twinking & PLing.
Low level melees have always been helpless, long before KEI. I can't tell
you how many times groups told my Barbarian Warrior "Come back when you're
level ten and might possibly be of some use to us." As for low level
chanters being obsolete, what will happen when through attrition all the
high level chanters are gone and there's no one left to cast KEI?

No, the real controversy with KEI lies in the mid-level game, where it
allows characters to continue to solo past their traditional "mandatory to
group now" levels.
