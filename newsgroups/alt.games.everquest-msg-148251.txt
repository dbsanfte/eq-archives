The list grows.
I think that there could be a small web site here.
Once I get all the links to Alla's data, and get each one listed for
class, and realistic level.
So any more to add or any more comments on the ones below ?

I know that a lot of the xxx Armour quests are quite variable with good
and bad items in the mix. Anyone know of sites that list which are the
best ones to do (e.g. for the Twighlight quests) or anyone want to
comment ?

Looks like there are more than 20 quests. There are well over that
already listed and some of the entries are multiple quests. So can we
hit 100 good quests?

Cheers,

Jim
