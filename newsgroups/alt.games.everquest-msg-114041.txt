Clerics and Enchanters maybe, but bards? Bards
typically are just very, very busy. It is the
class that requires the most attention and
effort to play well and it also requires a whole
lot more typing than most classes. Bards,
typically, don't have a lot of time for
chit-chat when they are grouped and when they do
say something it tends to be laconic.

I have never met a nasty Bard over level 30. I
have never met a sane Bard over level 30.
I have a theory, it could be bunnies....
