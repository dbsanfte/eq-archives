Yeah that happens too, guess the thing is EQ was never designed for
PvP team or otherwise but honestly its better without teams. The
design considerations for PvP go into the game at the begining not
after its been released. Again I dont recommend ANY zek, they all
pretty much suck but it can be fun once in a while just dont put all
your eggs in that basket....
