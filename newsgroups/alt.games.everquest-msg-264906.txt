Only a few seconds for the starting chain, no more than 5-10 I believe. Once 
the wheel is up, it's more like 30 seconds. The starting chain will be 
broken if *anyone* in the group takes an action that isn't in the icon list. 
The HO wheel is not as restrictive and simply does not advance until someone 
takes an action that is on the wheel.

> 2. Has anyone tried running two copies on one computer?

Yep, I've run two accounts simultaneously on one machine. I did it from the 
same base directory and it seemed to work just fine. There are separate UI 
settings files for each character.
