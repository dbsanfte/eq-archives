 According to an Admin GM I talked to, that's totally incorrect. This
wasn't a guide. I specifically asked if going LD cleared a trade
container and they said yes.

 But you can test it. Or I could I guess. Just put a few items in and
pull your connection and see what's there when you come back.

 Well it wasn't my suggestion but I'll go along with it based on what
happened to me and what I was told by Admin.

 Perhaps it was changed because as of a few weeks ago I know what
happened to me.
