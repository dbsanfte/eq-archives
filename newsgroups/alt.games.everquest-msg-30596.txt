You asked for snipping and bottom posting....
Why is bottom posting needed.. I prefer to have it at the top?.... please
explain
and please dont say its the norm... I have seen both types... and again
personaly I hate having to scroll down to see someones comments....
Unless they are put at various positons within the previous message to make
comments on different items.

Thanks
Lew
