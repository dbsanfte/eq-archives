Heh? They are both cast from the same die. You could cut and paste Tigger's
comment below itself and it would be equally as valid.

There is a certain level of wit that is needed to "ass whoop" someone in a
NG and Tigger don't own it. Biz on occasion has had it in the past but he
has grown lazy and is just a cranky old fart now. Tigger never had it, he
was always a spelling corrector/logic checker with the entertainment value
of a wet fart in a grass skirt but with less class....
