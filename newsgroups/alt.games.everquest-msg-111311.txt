Root -

I believe that every root caster eventually gets a 1.8 (or 1.75) second root
(Immobilize/Enveloping Roots).  MEMORIZE THAT SPELL.  Get ready to use it!!

Yeah, they don't have a high max root time, but you don't NEED max root time
in dungeons, you NEED to cast it then back the hell away from the critter.
This is especially important for enchanters and clerics but also VERY
important for every other class!

My primary is an enchanter and I WOULD NOT have a problem with a
druid/ranger breaking my mezz because of bad timing with Root.  It's easy
enough to re-mezz when I'm not being beat on.

Slow -
Enchanters, shaman and bards can all slow attack speeds.  The slower the
critter, the less chance the enchanter and cleric dies (which virtually
guarantees a total wipe out).  In most cases, CAST THIS FIRST!!  Even if
there's a shaman in the group, the enchanter and bard should have it up (I
believe bard slow stacks?)  Slow does take a lot of mana and when yours is
overwritten by someone else's that's mana out the window...but the fact is
that it's better to cast it twice than not at all.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE use these spells often enough to get it into your head
so that next time you're in an "Oh SHHIIITTTTTT" situation you don't freeze
up and do nothing at all.  Root stuff...if it can't reach you, you're ok.
Slow stuff if you can, because chances are the clerics are hitting Heal
buttons frantically, and the enchanters are hitting their mezz buttons
frantically and in both case probably SERIOUSLY pissing off the critters.

A CRITTER HITTING AT ONLY 40% OF THEIR REGULAR SPEED IS A JOKE.  When my
enchanter is being hit at that speed I have time to attempt rooting or
mezzing (if possible).  If it fails I then have time to TASH then root/mez
and all this time the cleric/healer has LOTS of time to cast heal on me.
