Substitute Muskie for Fish Rolls and you have that right, certainly.
That's my standard fare.

If it was that long of a camp/raid with that much steady action, there
was still time for Hot Pockets. Computer stations are one doorway and
fifteen feet from the fridge/freezer, and the microwave is almost within
reach of the keyboard. They can be a lifesaver in cases like that. Of
course, you have to pass on the sour cream and guac if you're that
active. That, or you keep some bread/rolls by the computer station, and
it only takes five seconds or so to grab a stack of cold cuts and cheese
and assemble sandwiches between spells, taunts, heals, what-have-you.
