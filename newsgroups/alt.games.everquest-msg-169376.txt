Good lord, hard to believe that this old chestnut is still coming up.
Anyway, John was 1/2 right, but let's set this straight.

As your swim skill improves, the speed that you swim at goes up, and
keeps going up until you max your skill. (200 for most, I beleive.) The
only other change is a *sligh* difference in mobility in the water.
(e.g. at very high skills you can actually swim *backwards* a tiny bit.
May not seem significant, but it can help tanks with mob positioning
during long underwater fights, and a couple other instances.)

Now, as to holding breath. A few of us, including yours truly, went and
created characters and did some experiments on this a year or two ago.
Let me assure you. Swimming skill has absolutely ZERO to do with how
long you can hold your breath. We took identical characters with all the
same stats (including stamina) where one had a swim skill of ZERO and
one had a max skill of 200 and threw them in the water. They began to
drown and then died in *exactly* the same amount of time.

We then took two characters who both had no swim skill, but massively
different STA scores. Tossed them in the water. The high stamina
character lasted well over twice as long as the low stamina one before
beginning to drown.

There are one, or possibly two, exceptions to this. First are the Iksar.
Regardless of their Stamina, they can hold their breath a long damned
time. Didn't find a way to confirm this, but they apparently hold their
breath as if they had a STA of 255 simply as a racial ability. They also
start out life with a 100 Swim skill, but that's irrelevant.

The second, possibly, could be Vah Shir because they weren't around at
the time of the testing, and I've never bothered to drown any.
