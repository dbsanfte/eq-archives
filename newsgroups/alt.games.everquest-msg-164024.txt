Wizards would probably object to this.

Essentially, changing this would require pretty much
everything in EQ to be changed. Suddenly *melees*
are the only ones with any hope of soloing.

Melees do much the same thing when there's no
healing on tap, but they call their mana "hit points".
A limited resource, used during combat, which
must be regained slowly outside of a combat setting.

Of course the game is balanced for grouping, which
is why so few high-level MOBs can be soloed by
the dedicated melee classes - it's *assumed* that
healing will be available in some form.

On that note, melees get their own KEI - called
"regeneration spells", although they don't last as long
and aren't nearly as effective. I remember my first
main character, a paladin, getting Diamondskin and
regen at level 2. Combat heaven. :-)

Casters are pretty useless in melee combat as a rule,
so their "combat resource" is mana, not HP. If a
MOB starts pounding on a caster, the caster can
frequently expect to die soon. If the caster is out
of mana and in combat, death is usually not far away.

In any case, the game is balanced for the current
setup; Sony won't be making any changes *that*
fundamental as long as EQ remains viable.

If you're looking for something to make soloing more
practical for melees, a*really* high-level regen (5%
of total HP per tick, for example, and lasting a couple
of hours) would do the job. Just make sure it's as
expensive to get as KEI. :-)

(The % of total HP, rather than an absolute number,
is to make it less useful to caster classes.)

Make it an effect on a clickable item, with a 1 hour
refresh, equippable by melee classes only... or something
like that, the idea is to take the monopoly on useful
buffs away from casters. Though I'm not sure whether
the game mechanics could handle it. (item would be
NODROP and only available from a very high level
MOB.) Or maybe a high-level AA ability (again,
with a long refresh.)
