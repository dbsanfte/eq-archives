Hm, there must be a template then for all those lvl60 in 30 days spoiler
sites I've come across.
And btw, nowadays you can reach lvl65 even lvl70 once Omens of war comes
out. So you might have needed a little to much time to finish your
'spoiler'.

For all those that didn't get the irony in my sentences above this
advertised spoiler is probably far out of date. And most if not
everything therein you can find freely on the web.

P.S.: Sorry to all folks who have this guy in their killfile. I just had
to answer this as it sounded reasonable at first.
