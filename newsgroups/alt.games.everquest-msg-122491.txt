Somewhat.  The physical thing that they represent is the same, but are the
words really exactly the same, except for sound?  Some words are considered
vulgar because of what they once represented.

Let's say, for example, the word "rape" becomes popular as a general word
for sex (given today's culture, it's not that far out of the realm of
possiblity).  Twenty years down the road, the orginal meaning for rape may
have faded, but does the word still have some bit of it's orignal meaning?
Would a rape victim, who remembers the orignal meaning, not be offended by
the use of the term?

Likewise, why are racial slurrs still considered a bad thing?  Is "nigger"
not "just a word?"  No, it contains memories of things past, which make it
inappropriate for use.  In fact, in this case, it goes even beyond that.
Look the word up on a dictionary from the beginning of the 1900's.  You'll
find that it means "a person of poor character or esteem," and has no racial
meaning at all.  Yet, now the word has meaning beyond that.
