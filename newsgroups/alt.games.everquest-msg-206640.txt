While you can train it at 16, it's better to wait until 19.  The cap for
research is 5*(Level-15).  When you put the initial training point into a
skill at level N, it sets you skill to the lower of N and the cap.  So,
here's what happens if you first train research at various levels:

    Level       Cap     What you get
    16          5           5
    17          10          10
    18          15          15
    19          20          19
    20          25          20

Worse, for the longest time, some of the components were not in the game for
some of the practice runes.  I vaguely recall them fixing that, but that was
after I was done with research, and I haven't had the time yet to see if LoY
is going to make me want to take up research again.

You've forgotten vendors.  Most research components are vendor fodder to
everyone except the class that needs them.

Research isn't something where you say "OK, I want that spell...so I'm going
to go out today and get everything I need for it".  It's more of a "keep an
eye out for it" thing.  That is, you buy components as you find them on
vendors, or as you get them yourself from mobs when you are in a group
fighting stuff of the appropriate level.  (Appropriate level can include
high blue...because when you are going to research your spells, you have to
give up on the notion of having your level N spells when you are level
N...it might take a few levels past that).

Before the Bazaar: research was clearly worth it.  After the Bazaar: it can
probably be safetly skipped.

However, one thing to consider is the LoY research.  I haven't done any
research (no pun intended!) into whether that makes research as a trade
skill (as opposed to research as a way to get your own spells) worthwhile.
