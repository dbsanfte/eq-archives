	It doesn't have to cope with an overwhelming attack, it only has to deter
one.  Even a system with a pathetically low chance of stopping a missile aimed
at a silo can do that, by dramatically increasing the number of warheads
needed for a pre-emptive strike.

	Because people are not rational actors, and don't always use the best
strategies.  A nutjob like Khadaafi or Hussein who's about to get thrown out
of power may not care about the retaliation.  Eventually, some mental furball
is going to get his hands on a nuclear missile and wing it at someone, and
currently our defenses strategy would have to be "watch it land".
