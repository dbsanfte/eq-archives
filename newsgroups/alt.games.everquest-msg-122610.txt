Thats ridiculous. Its like saying "nigger" is offensive
because one "decides" to give it the offensive meaning for
the racial type refered to. Its patently not; its to do with the
connotations and concepts conveyed by the words themselves.

Language means what it means, and thats how it works. Its not a matter
of "deciding" it means something on a personal and individual basis,
for it to have any utility at all we agree *shared* meaning and
irrefutably the meaning and connotations of "fuck" are different
to "copulate".

Saying "I dont care about other peoples sensibilities" (or "cultures"
if you prefer) is just selfish beyond compare. I'm not arguing you
should never swear, or emphasise using "rude" words, but "They're
words no different from 'sunshine' and I'll use them whenever I want
regardless of how they affect you" seems ludicrous to me.

Anyway. Dead topic I think. I dont see you converting any time
soon. ;)
