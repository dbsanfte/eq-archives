My ranger hunts animals of all sorts, uses the pelts and the meat both...
I think of him as a hunter, in fact that's less repulsive than killing even
evil intelligent creatures.

My friend's ranger, on the other hand, sees killing animals for any
purpose, be it sport, food, or pelts, as repulsive, and on the other
hand hates orcs with a passion unparrallelled.

This is the beauty of Role playing, you get to make up your own
story and character choices about your character, and they
don't have to be cookie cutter with everyone else's.

My cleric to this day maintains that he should have taken Dad's
advice and become a Paladin instead of a cleric like Mom wanted;
he melees, solos, casts spells -other- than heals much of the time...
its a different approach, but its an enjoyable one.  He also maintains
that he's -not- a dwarf at all, but that A) all the races except gnomes and
halflings are tall, gnomes and halflings are the short ones and
B) he's a Coldain with a tan.

My Erudite necro would not group with him on a bet, that's madness
talking!  Good thing the two of them are never online at the same time.
