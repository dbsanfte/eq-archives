Their final answer is below.  Silly me, I guess I'm supposed to be
overjoyed that they reset my faction =(   Thanks for all the words of
support guys, although, quite obviously, logic does not work with
these people.  Guess I just have to accept that I'm SOL thanks to SOE
on completing this quest.  I agree that even getting the tear refunded
would have at least shown a little compassion.  I never expected
anyone to hand me the Spear, but to be told 'sorry, you tried to cheat
so yuo're outa luck' , well, that is just poor customer service.  I
don't see any other way that can be taken.

Thanks again for the support, at least I know that I'm not the only
one who thinks this is BS.

Greetings Brian,

This is Lead Gm Salonafinn responding to your email on the issue with
your epic.  I am sorry that you feel the way you do about this issue.
I wish that I could be of more assistance to you.  I know that I would
be frustrated as well.  However keep in mind that we did make the epic
attainable for you.  In your previous state of faction, you would not
have been able to complete it at all. 

My concerns for my customers are not based on if I decide to enforce
the rules or not.  I am sorry that you believe I do not care because I
cannot allow rules to be broken.  I will however again thank you for
feedback and welcome you to go in game and type /feedback to add your
idea for the linear epic quest to the pot of ideas for up coming
expansions.

Thank you so much for your time and thank you for your continued
support of
EverQuest.


Safe Travels to You,
~Salonafinn~
