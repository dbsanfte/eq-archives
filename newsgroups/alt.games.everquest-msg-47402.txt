If your drive isn't partitioned then partition it on this format. Then
install EQ on another partition, not C:
This will save you having to reinstall EQ again (reinstalling EQ isn't much
of a job, waiting for the patch to complete on ISDN or less is a bitch) and
as you use AOL I'd say you are on a modem, don't make any plans to play for
a couple of hours after the install.

As has been said, the account keys are only used to create an account, once
they are active you just need to install and login with a valid user name
and password.
You cannot create a new account with an account that has already been used,
you can, however log onto any other account from your install.
