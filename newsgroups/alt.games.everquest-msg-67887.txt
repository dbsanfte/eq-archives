Hehe I love CB and the trains...it's fun to watch people die while medding
at the zone and then whine in GFay a minute later who think that sitting on
train tracks is perfectly ok.  There are lots of safe places in CB to med
with no worries of trains.  The closest to the zone is...enter the zone,
hang a very sharp left as soon as you can.  You'll see a bridge.  Med/heal
up about 30' to the right of that bridge on the ZONE side of the bridge.

GFay is about as dangerous to med as the CB side...zone ping pong is not
fun. :p
