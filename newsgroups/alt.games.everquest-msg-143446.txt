Allegedly that part is fixed, and if you had the faction to do the prior
turnins before they "fixed" it, you can now turn in the staves for the
final bit just fine. A couple wizards from Graffe's have already done so
since the fix, and they also didn't go KOS.

However, determining if you *have* that faction now is tricky since they
screwed up one of Arantir's turnins.
