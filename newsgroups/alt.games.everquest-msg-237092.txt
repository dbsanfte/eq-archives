The only skill I have heard of that required success to raise was sense
heading. I've seen plenty of melee skillups from misses while raising a
warrior to 58 and a rogue to 65. The biggest trick to keeping melee
skills up while twinking is fast weapons and a good haste item. Unless
you have a team twinking you, experience slows down enough after 45 that
your melee skills usually catch up to where they should be fine before
you hit 51 where they start to raise again. The only melee skill my
warrior didnt have maxed nearly every level was 2h blunt, as I couldn't
afford a fast enough 2hb to keep it up.

Reds actually seem to give the fastest skillups, but you really can't
use those practically to do it. Until, that is, you get to the plane of
time. A couple of casters in our guild have raised unused weapon skills
rather quickly while waiting for officers to decide the loot off Quarm,
or did until someone new to Time thought it was ok to nuke Zeb's cage
and there was a mad scramble to get Quarm looted before the script
finished.
