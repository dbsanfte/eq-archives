More what? Irrelevant crap? Recall how "bad" the "leaked" alpha of Doom3 
ran? Have you seen the reports of people getting "decent" gameplay on a 
P1.5 GF4 MMX on the offical version due out soon?

I haven't been following the development of EQII so I have no idea how 
far along they are, considering they're still in early/private beta, I'd 
guess they have a long while to go. So, anything and everything you 
post, while not only against the NDA, is also totally and utterly 
useless. All it does is give people something to bitch about with no 
facts to back it up.

*sigh*
