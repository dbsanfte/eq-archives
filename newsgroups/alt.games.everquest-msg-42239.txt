On advice of a friend, I sought out the hermit in Lake Rathe yesterday
with a cunning plan.  He is a six minute spawn, nothing wanders nearby,
he's at level 19 every time.
He is also aggro to everyone, and can't be targetted from the lake, as
he spawns in a
hut with the entrance facing away from shore.

No worries, I figured I'd break in easily, then set up for business in
his little nook where
targetting wouldn't be a problem.

Well, breakin was unneeded, as there was someone already camping him
there, and that person was about to log so the camp was mine.

Parked my pet in front of the hut and settled in to watch, to make sure
the pet could kill him.  He popped... and stood there, not attacking.
Conned indifferent, in fact.  I walked up to him, tried to chat, waved a
hand in front of his face... nothing.

So much for my plan of parking the pet there and going afkish!

He's indifferent to Erudite Necros who worship Cazic Thule, or else I've
done something to build faction with whatever he is on.  He doesn't give
a faction hit when killed, either, so I was unable to convince his
future spawns to hate me.

At first I thought perhaps he'd been nerfed to prevent just this sort of
behavior, but a
chanter happened by, came up on the dock and was instantly attacked out
of hand, just
as I'd been told.

This isn't a complaint, or a request for help, or anything like that, by
the way, just thought it was a funny story to share with the kiddies

Shrouds
20 Necro, Morel Thule
(would have been 21 if the plan had worked!)
