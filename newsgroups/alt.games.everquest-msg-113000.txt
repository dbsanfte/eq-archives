Kevy, this is usenet, not all news servers get all messages.  Often replies
arrive before what is being replied to.  I see this all the time, heck, I
sometimes see replies to my posts before my post shows up.  This is why you
quote, so that those that have not, or possibly never will, see the original
post, will still know what is being talked about.
