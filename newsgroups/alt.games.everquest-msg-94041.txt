    They can't be too stupid - they did, after all, kick your troll asses
out of Guk, didn't they? :-)

    The wall pictures in Upper Guk that told that story have been a bit
obscured compared to before the new textures, I find. But you can still see
it, especially in the white-walled Priest room in Upper - Guk used to be a
troll home, with the frogloks as slaves. Makes you wonder why the trolls
carved such tiny passages all over the place, but I guess architecture isn't
a troll strong point. I'm DETERMINED to figure out the heiroglyphs in Ssra
and Akheva next. I think I have a good theory on the ones in the Itraer Vius
room, and the discovery of the invisible NPC in the room where he should be
kind of confirms it, but I need to test it next time we go kill him.
Hopefully he'll have two ranger swords visible, so nobody will be in a big
hurry to gank him. :-)
