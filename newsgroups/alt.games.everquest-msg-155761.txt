Water elemental: enduring breath
Air elemental: levitation
Earth elemental: some STR
Fire elemental: damage shield
Drybones skel: added fire resist
Wolf: wander around Unrest unmolested
Werewolf + faction buff (may have to be Collaboration...dunno if lower level
spell will work): wander around Velks unmolested (unless you get dispelled)
Ogre: Bash skill (skill level 1 so really pretty much pointless but... <g> )
Imp: levitation and I think some fire resist...but not as good as skel.

Upcoming illusions: scarecrow...get to run funny
Froglok...hopefully you'll flip when you cast a spell. :)
