    Go through the list of caster-usable armour. Or caster-usable weapons.
Now look at the list of melee-usable gear. THERE is what the melees get,
every expansion. New gear. From what I've heard, there's actually going to
be a caster renaissance in SoL - new items that will function much like
focus items, or caster haste. So that a caster's damage output over time can
actually RISE the same as a melee's has.
