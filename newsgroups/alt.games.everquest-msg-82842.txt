Actually, loot drops into the first available inventory slot in which it
will fit.  If you have any available general inventory slots, they fill up
first.  Next your first bag will fill up, then your next bag, etc.  If the
item will not fit in a particular bag, then it won't go in that bag, it will
go in the first one it can fit in.  The one exception is if it is an item
that stacks, and you have any non full stacks of it, it will then be placed
in the first nonfull stack of the same item.
