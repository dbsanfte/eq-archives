AUTOSPLIT IS A CHEAT

Never ever use autosplit unless you don't care about loot, or want
to hog the loot while fooling the newbs into thinking you are sharing.

Autosplit DOES NOT split the cash fairly

what it does is split the coins.  While this seems like the same thing,
it is NOT.

If there are a number of coins in every category that is divisible
by the number of people in your group, then (and only then) the
distribution will be fair.

But if there is one extra pp... the looter keeps it.  If there are five
extra pp (in a 6 man group) the looter keeps it all.  If there are fewer
of a coin category then there are group members, the looter keeps it
all.

The looter ends up with an average of four times as much cash as
everyone else.

Pick a Master Looter, and have him sell off junk at the end of the
run, roll off the valuables, and split the cash out fairly, probably
after paying the cleric and possibly chanter for gems used saving your
lives.

There are other fair systems, but autosplit is simply -not- one of them.
