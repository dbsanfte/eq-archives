Hi.

I had a setup very much like yours, when I installed Velious (long 
after Luclin) and started the patcher it told me that it would patch
for about 2 hours.!

I wasn't very happy with that, so I canceled the patcher - 
re-installed SoL (5 min in 'Repair' mode) and restarted the patcher,
which now finished in 12 - 15 minutes :-))

I have enabled the new re-textured files for all Era's and I believe
that's the reason.
