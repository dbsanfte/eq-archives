I disagree.

As a software engineer, I like to think of my computer as a mini-
universe.  In fact, I like to think of my running programs themselves
as mini-universes.

I can use a debugger to attach to one of my running programs and
examine the contents of memory, see which line of code is currently
executing, etc.

I have effectively observed a mini-universe without interacting with
it.  The HUP doesn't apply here: my act of observation won't change
anything.

I can also "perform miracles" by changing values in memory.  I've
made a change to the mini-universe without being *in* the mini-
universe.  Magic!
