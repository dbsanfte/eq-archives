I was in a pick-up group in PC with an alt when someone trained C2 with a 
train of magnificent proportions. I'm really not sure that they missed a mob 
in the entire cavern. They certainly had at least a few of every type.

My groupmates did not think that it was at all appropriate for me to 
congratulate the offender for having the largest train that I had seen since 
the good ol' days in Blackburrow. lol

The way those clowns were crying you would have thought that they lost half 
of lev 69 to the death.
