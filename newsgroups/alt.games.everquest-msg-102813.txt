: 
: 
: 
:       Two Fresno men and a boy with gang ties were arrested Tuesday night
: on suspicion of murdering a Fowler man and burning his body in the bed of a
: pickup truck.
: 
:       Jesus Rosalio Lopez, 27, Ramiro Roman Jr., 18, and a 17-year-old boy
: are in custody on charges of killing D.J. Hunter, a 19-year-old Fowler High
: School graduate and Reedley College student.
: 
:       Hunter, who was burned beyond recognition, was positively identified
: Wednesday through dental records.
: 
:       Firefighters found Hunter's charred remains and his stripped GMC
: truck about 6 a.m. Friday on South Muscat Avenue west of West Avenue
: southwest of Fresno.
: 
:       Hunter is the grandson of former Fowler Mayor Don Wright. His family
: owns an oil company in Fowler, a community of about 4,100 residents in
: south Fresno County.
: 
:       "You just get kind of numb," Sandra Feaver, a longtime family friend,
: said of Hunter's death. "Now you know it's real."
: 
:       The suspects also face charges including carjacking, robbery, arson,
: kidnap and receiving stolen property. They are being jailed in lieu of more
: than $1 million bail each.
: 
:       Feaver said Hunter's family is glad the suspects were arrested so
: soon: "People are so jealous of what other people have that they would take
: a life for a pickup. It's scary to know these people live in this area."
: 
:       Lopez and Roman were arrested during the execution of four search
: warrants on Fresno homes Tuesday. The boy was arrested after authorities
: found him riding in a car, sheriff's Sgt. Toby Rien said Wednesday.
: 
:       Tips from community members led authorities to the suspects, Rien
: said.
: 
:       Lopez is on federal probation for drug charges, officials said. It
: was not immediately known whether Roman or the boy have criminal histories.
: 
:       Authorities found stereo parts from Hunter's truck and other evidence
: inside the suspects' homes, said Rien, adding that his detectives are
: searching for more suspects. "This vehicle was stripped, and it takes a lot
: of people to do that," he said.
: 
:       Officials are investigating whether three guns found in the homes are
: linked to the crime.
: 
:       Although an autopsy has been completed, authorities have not released
: Hunter's cause of death.
: 
:       "This has been like a puzzle to our detectives, and we're putting the
: pieces in place," Rien said. "This still is early in the investigation. We
: have a lot of unanswered questions."
: 
:       Detectives don't believe the suspects knew Hunter before meeting him
: after 1:30 a.m. Friday at a convenience store in southeast Fresno. Rien
: would not name the store or say exactly where it is located.
: 
:       Hunter reportedly had left a friend's Fowler house about 12:30 a.m.
: Friday and was on his way home.
: 
:       "There really wasn't much of a connection other than being in the
: same place at the same time," Rien said. "Their meeting probably was not a
: positive one."
: 
:       The sergeant would not say what happened afterward, or pinpoint a
: motive.
: 
:       Rien, however, said "it's a possibility" the suspects killed Hunter
: to get to his truck, which is worth about $20,000 and had 20-inch chrome
: rims.
: 
:       The truck was voted best car by students at Fowler High School.
: Hunter, who played varsity basketball there, kept the truck spotless.
: 
:       Hunter's friends have tied yellow ribbons around light posts, taped
: photos of him around town and made key chains and car decals in his memory.

Another American killed by terrorists, this time by the La Raza terrorists who Bush 
gives amnesty to so they can continue to come here by the tens of thousands and then 
breed like cockroaches and cleanse Whites from the continent.
