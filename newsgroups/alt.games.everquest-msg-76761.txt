OK, I do have hotkeys, but it still requires a lot of keyboard play.  
Every one of my songslots has a hotkey:

/pause 3, /stopsong
/cast X

I also have a hotkey for /pet attack and /pet guard and /pet backoff, but 
it still means that I have to hit the hotkey, wait a beat, then start 
typing my insults.  I guess I could hotkey my insults, but they then begin 
to lack the personal touch that makes them so much fun.
Ohhh, I just re-read your message, and yeah, you're telling me to hotkey 
the insults, I guess I really should do that.  Of course I have all 10 of 
my hotkey banks filled, though I rarely use bank 9, but my charming set-up 
is on bank 2.  Hmmm, starting to look like a lot of work just to tell 
random_dr00d_01, "You're a kneebiter, Dent!"
