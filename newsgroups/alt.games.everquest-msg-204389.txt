What does SWG have going for it? Customization in character creation.
You can customize everything about your character physically (well
almost everything), from how heavy he is, to how long/broad his nose
is. His cheekbones, chin, hair, facial hair, eye shape, eye width, eye
angle, etc, etc. That is just the humans. All the races have a great
deal of possible configurations physically. Character creation is one
of the best parts of the game.

With the skill trees, your skills can be just as varied as your
appearance. I am not going to delve into the mechanics, but the
skill-tree method of advancement was a refreshing change from the very
linear and strict EQ leveling. That being said, the way you increase
in skill needs a lot of work. Not balanced and too fast.

The crafting skills have a great deal of possibility. When you have
harvested enough materials to make an item, you can go to a public
crafting station. While there you can experiment on the item. You can
try to modify a laser pistol's damage, range, durability, and
efficiency for example. I made a weaponsmith, so weapons were really
the only type of crafting I did. The potential for a great crafting
system is there, it's just not done.

Let me see..............the graphics are really nice. Some of the
sound effects are cool...........hmmmm.......well, I can't find
anything else that would be nice to say, so I won't say it. I will
leave the trashing of the game to others. Believe, there will be
plenty of people doing that.

I will not be buying SWG until they release the space expansion, even
then I will have to give it some serious thought.
