Rule 11:  Names that contain sentences, phrases, or more than two
words.  (Ikillorcs, Ontop, Petcarbob, Diediedie).  Descriptive
compound words are allowed, especially in surnames (e.g. Treehugger,
Giantslayer).

"Sing a song", and "I like to sing" obviously break this rule.  It has
nothing to do with them being offensive.

Presumably he would have succeeded if he'd used something like
"Singer" (although possible TM infraction with the sewing machine
company), "Deathsinger" if he's a mean bard, "Lifesinger" if he's a
nice bard, or any of a myriad other possibilities by putting a noun in
front of "singer".  Might try "Meistersinger", but as it has a title
built in, it's in violation of Rule 10.
