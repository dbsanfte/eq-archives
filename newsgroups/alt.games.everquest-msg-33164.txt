I was sittign in Freeport and working my baking, when a level 3 rogue comes
up to me and asks for some plat.  So I invited him onto a group and said,
"Stay here, I'll get some cash from the bank."  So I went to the bank, and
took out 20,000 copper and did /split.  I deposited my 10k back in the bank
and was feeling satisfied that I tricked a beggar.  I see him then standing
unable to move, and unwilling to part with his 100pp.  I start to chuckle to
myself. Then a wandering guard walks by, and the beggar attacks him and
dies.  5 secnods later, same rogue runs up, and proceeds to drag his corpse
to the bank.
