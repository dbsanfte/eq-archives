I got mine at the Virgin Megastore in Vegas.
I can't stand that overpriced dive, but I had a $50 gift thingee
burning a hole in my wallet for 2 years.   
It's sad tho that while in Vegas I didn't gamble, drink (much), or
enjoy the company of some some legal "ladies", just kicked off my EQ
addiction.  ;)

I happened to come across it, wasn't actively looking.  My guess is to
try non-gaming places such as Tower Records, Virgin, etc.  Basically,
the places you WOULDN'T go for games.

Good luck
