You should hunt in warrens and kill kobolds. The kobolds drop a 
tooth called kobold molar. You give the kobold molars at paladin 
guild (Tiam Khonsir) in Erudin for xp, gold and occasional piece of
ringmail armor.  It is easy to get hold of lots of tooth, bring lots
of backpacks.

After you got most of your body covered you should buy from players.
