    Absolutely.  It causes way fewer deaths.

    That's the stupid way, though.  Way too many unneccesary deaths.  On
Druzzil, we port up groups of Monks and Rogues who are the scout group, they
watch for Roaming mobs and as soon as the pats are clear, we port up the
main tank group.  They form a wall.  Then the chanter group comes up.  Then
the rest.  We hold the entrance, and then use our stolen/secret deck system
and rule the entire zone with NO deaths (unless you're stupid).

    Heh, not true.  There are roaming mobs at the entrance to the zone.  You
either aggro them immediately or you can stand there for a few minutes
before they walk around the corner.  (Monks and Rogues can tell you when
that is...)
