Apologies for the earlier blank post.

I use a slime coated harpoon in my primary, crystal grinder in the other. After
about lvl 35 everything started resisting ED, and the SBD lost it's usefulness.
I'd like to get some new weapons, but woo! Poison making sucks up every penny I
got.

Hope to see you in rogue BotB someday ^_~
