Aoebe learned the hard way last night in Paudel Caverns that
she is a healer, not a nuker....

Grouped with a sam level (17) beastlord with some kind of warder,
and was up 'doing' some kind of dark blue fiend on a rocky ledge
after the camp just in from Shadow Haven.

Here's the sad part, mana was down to just about 15%, and Aoebe
mentioned to the beastlord that medding was needed, yet, two fiends
came up and started whacking on the said same beastlord.....I actually
think the beast lord pulled one after I asked to med.

Needless to say I did not have enough to heal either of us, and I used my
last few mana points to try and kill the one fiend that was worse off.

Did not work, the Beast lord died, I then have two of them on me.  I was
able
to kill the one, then melee the other until I killed it with 2% health left.

I crawl up the wall and start medding and I noted my health bar dropping
to 1%,, 0%,, then notice creeping crud.....I had just enought time to mem
the cure disease spell, and cast it...nothing, two more times and the crud
is gone
at about the same time I went 'purple' on the health bar.....yuck...I
recover
a few momments later, and med enought for a heal to 7% health.

Here's why I am writing, the beastlord sends me a tell ranting about my
nuking
versus healing, I apologize, to the person, and make a public apology
flogging my
poor skills that I learned a lesson at their expense.  I offered a
'reanimate', but
did not quite feel I needed to offer pp for a percentage rez.  Level 17 I
figure
you die a few times, and you just get on with it.

So I am clear, the cleric's duties are to keep people alive, even in a two
person
group, to the extent there is no nuking?  Stuns seemed to lessen the damage
the beastlord took, and they may have been mistaken for nukes.  Aoebe will
be back there tonight, asking for forgivness again, but also asking to be
part
of a larger group versus a two person group.

BTW, Mighty tasty exp.
