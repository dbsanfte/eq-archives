I agree -- I'm loving it on FV, having a total blast almost every night.  I
do agree it can be hard to find a group sometimes because the server is
slightly undercrowded... but then undercrowded is, IMHO, preferable to over
crowded.

The only change I'd like Verant to make (going to talk to Abashi about this
soon) is to change it back to you can see people's race/class/level, at
least for the zone you're in... it's too hard to find groups otherwise.  I
like the TLC, but then I always have been a proponent of it (I realize it's
controversial). I also really like the language restrictions because I think
it separates the races at first, making micro-communities and making
regional differences more important.  As for the elimination of the majority
of no-drop restrictions on items, I don't think it's clear yet on what
effect that will really have...  It may accelerate the trickle-down effect
and some twinking, but then hopefully the one character per server
restriction with act to counteract such an effect.

I'm lucky enough to have a close group of friends in a small guild, and so
we play together almost every night -- I'm having the time of my life, and
am very glad to have to the time now to really enjoy EQ after working on it
so long.
