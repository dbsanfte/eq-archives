I know that's what you read but really, that's not what I meant to
say. I believe after PoP there won't be anything truly new added to
EQ. Maybe more of the old, but nothing like more AAXP or new combat
disciplines (AFTER PoP, I mean).

Every inch of distance they could have gotten out of the EQ system
will have been gotten. Or at least, as much as they ever intend to.

They farm until all their members have as good as they are likely to
get, then go into alt mode until the next expansion. It takes a long
time, though.
