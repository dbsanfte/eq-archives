Yeah, I ran across this one time when I was grouped with a friend.
We spouted various languages back and forth and trained each other
up not only in the languages we already knew well, but in languages
we barely knew.  It was very strange.  I have no idea what the
logic is behind letting me train someone else to speak a language
BETTER than I can!

I guess they figure that languages don't mean squat in the game
(except maybe on FV? I've never played there) so why not let players
be able to boast that they're Masters in Old Dragon speech...
