So? Where does that invalidate my argument. Whether I wear the tag or not,
I do my best to support and further my guild. The tag doesn't make the
player - or the guild. Would you join Veritas (only one I pay attention to
because I know Bob Perez is a member) on AB just because you saw people
with a tag. Would I join Veritas because of the tag? No way. Not till I
played with a few *members*. (Note: I'm not dissing Veritas, Bob, never
played with any <g>). I've grouped with Bob in DAoC but that says nothing
about *Veritas* now does it? The point is advertising aside, it's the
*members* and their *actions* that make up the guild. *NOT* the tag.

To wit DT replied: "You're being exceptionally dense. People join guilds
for socializing, unity, and so forth. A lot of people take pride in working
together with a guild and want to show their association off. I can think
of absolutely no good reason to restrict people from being able to show
their guild tag. A carrot is fine, but this is something that should be
part of the "basic package"." 

Which is what I replied to. Where does it say that the guild tag should be
in the "basic package"? My *point* was that I agree that people should
*work* to obtain the status of being able to show their tag. I have *no*
problem with showing a tag. But I don't think it should be done as part of
any "package". That was done in EQ1 already. You know what I learned from
that? That the ooober cocky guilds wouldn't get in *my* groups. You know
why? Cause their tag was from a certain guild. I have come to realize that
that is too biased in my thinking. I've learned to get past that and check
you the *player*.

Now who's mincing words and splitting hairs? Where does personal
satisfaction equate to selfish? I can certainly get personal satisfaction
without selfishness. Does a priest get personal satisfaction with helping a
member overcome some problem? Would you call him selfish?
