Huge snips !

This whole thing got me interested.
So by combining the info for xp needed and the info on what is a blue to
me mob and an xp for mobs equation I found on hackersquest (
Level*level*ZEM ) I did some math.

What I did was calculate what level a random blue mob would be for each
level.
So for example at level 18 a blue mob can be anything from 13 to 17 so
my random blue mob is level 15. I then calculated how many you would
need to get the next level. (I had to make a few assumptions with the
high end stuff as I did not have the blue zone information for 53 - 60
so I assumed that 40 was blue to all of them. probably wrong, but at 60
you won't be fighting level 59 mobs by accident for xp anyhow so it
probably evens out)

Then I compaired the number of average blue kills needed level on level.

First thing to note is that leveling gets easier from 1 through to 29.
Ignoring level 1-6 where you don't fight blues exclusivly anyhow.
[below fighres for a ZEM of 100]
level 7  = 35 - 36 kills 
level 29 = 31 - 32 kills 

Whee easier to get 29 than 7 !

Then you hit level 30 = 63 - 64 kills or just over twice as hard.

Having said that level 29 is the easiest level of all 31 is only 9%
harder.
Needing just 34 - 35 kills

Well here is the list :

I will let you judge, but for what it is worth I would say that 51 - 59
all look quite hellish, with 54 and 59 giving you an extra time and a
half.

Oh and just to discourage newbies here are some fun figures :

Part way through level 55 you are half way to the xp total you need to
finish 60. At the end of level 30 (hell and all) you are only 4.4% of
the way there.

Even going by the number of blue kills required does not make it much
better. You reach half way some where between 47 and 48. and at the end
of 30 you have traveled just over a quarter of the way.

And this is making very optimistic guesses about hunting in the 40's and
50's and assumes that all you do is xp grind, that you solo the whole
way and never die. Lol what fun stats are.

HTH,

Jim
