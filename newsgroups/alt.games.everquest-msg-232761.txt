Boca Raton, FL � January 22nd, 2004 � Internet Gaming Entertainment, Ltd.
(�IGE�) (www.ige.com), the worldwide leader in the market for buying and selling
virtual property used in multiplayer online games, announced today that it has
agreed to acquire substantially all of the assets of Yantis Enterprises, Inc.
(www.mysupersales.com).
The deal involves both cash and equity in IGE�s parent company, IGE U.S. LLC
(�IGE U.S.�), headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida, according to Randy Maslow,
Senior Vice President and General Counsel of IGE U.S.
Massively multiplayer online role-playing games (�MMORPGs�) like EverQuest and
Ultima Online are filled with virtual property � things like magic weapons,
houses, in-game currency, and characters that are bought and sold on auction
exchanges, with thousands of dollars trading hands every day. The total trade
volume for virtual property is estimated by Professor Edward Castronova,
professor of economics at Cal-State Fullerton, to exceed $400m annually, with an
undetermined portion of that amount annually captured in real-world dollars by
dealers in virtual currency and goods. 

With more than 80 employees and thousands of suppliers, IGE is the largest
provider in the world of virtual currency exchange and game-enhancement services
to players of MMORPGs. The company provides 24x7x365 customer service and tech
support from its state of the art operations center in Kowloon Bay, Hong Kong. 

�Jonathan Yantis is an entrepreneur who blazed the trail in creating a market
for the exchange of virtual currency and property,� said Brock Pierce, CEO of
IGE U.S. �This acquisition is a big step for both us and the virtual currency
exchange market as a whole, and solidifies our position as the largest player in
this market by far.�

Mr. Yantis will be joining IGE U.S. as Chief Operating Officer and a member of
the company�s Board of Managers. The other members of the Board include Mr.
Pierce, Mr. Maslow and Alan Debonneville, President of the IGE subsidiary in
Hong Kong. 

�This is a marriage of the two pioneers in this industry,� said Jonathan Yantis.
�I�m excited to be joining IGE and look forward to our future successes
together.�
