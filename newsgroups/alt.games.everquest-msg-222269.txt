  Lull, Mez, Haste, Slow.    I saw Cantada pop up a few times, but he wasn't
singing it very much, when he was at all.   I'm not sure what his other 3
songs were.

What a wonderfully overgeneralized caster / healer centered viewpoint.  (not
suprising considering the classes you play :) )   It assumes a whole host of
conditions, and takes them all for granted.  It is true quite often, but
only when mana regeneration is your bottleneck.  That is not always the
case, and certainly wasn't the case here.

Both groups in question were mid 50's for the most part.  Paladin, Rogue,
Rogue, Ranger, Cleric, Bard was group one.   Paladin, Rogue, Ranger, Ranger,
Cleric, Bard was group two.(1)

In both, Cantada would have been a complete waste.  The cleric already had C
3, so he was easily keeping up on heals.   Mana was not our bottleneck.   A
"shut up and play manasong, bitch" bard would have added almost nothing.
Woo, the cleric now has enough mana to use his extremely inefficient nukes.
That'll add a lot of DPS.   Oh, and so can the ranger, even though her nukes
probably do less than her normal melee.  Hit point regeneration?   Mobs were
hitting for 200, and almost completely on the paladin.   25? hp every 6
seconds from Cantada... what is that going to do to anything?

Our bottleneck was melee damage, and outputting enough of it.   With which
he helped immensely.   Sung haste had our rogues and rangers inflicting
massive damage, until his epic proc'ed, which it did quite frequently.  So
even when he went off to pull, we had 55% haste up the entire time.  All we
were really losing was bard level slow, for the few seconds he was gone.
Having the next mob there to keep fighting was *much* more important than
getting the cleric / paladin / ranger a little extra mana that they didn't
need anyways.


Higher DPS is centered around identifying and then alleviating your
bottlenecks.   Which will be different in each group.  Had the group been
Paladin, Bard, 3 Wizards and a Cleric...  then you would definitely have
been correct in your generalization.

Pure sneak pulling is very hard, and somewhat situational if the rouge is
attempting to do it alone.   But with a FD class, it works perfectly.

I'm sure you know the basics of feign pulling, so a quick overview...  Monk
(or SK) aggros the mobs and runs back to a point between the pull location
and the group's current location.   If only one mob aggros, he brings it to
the group.   2 or more, he feigns death, and waits for all but one of them
to wander back to thier starting location, at which point he brings the now
solo mob to the group to kill.

It's very safe, but the main complaint, especially relevant in an LDoN
setting, is that it takes too long.   It's not even that it takes a while
for the mobs to wander back after the monk feigns.   Thats usually only a
few seconds, during which your casters are medding in any event.  The huge
time loss is that often, the mobs will turn and begin walking home at the
exact same time.   The monk has to stand up and aggro them, then feign again
until finally, only one is left.   Which can take several attempts.

This is where the rogue comes in.  He eliminates the vast majority of this
time loss, by making every feign a successful split.   Here is the trick...
when a rogue is hidden, attacking (or using a throwing weapon / bow) breaks
hide, the same as it would invisibility.   But it does not break sneak.
Having a mob hit you is what breaks sneak.    Sneak works by making you
indifferent to every mob, when you are standing in thier rear arc.

Now the worst part of feign pulling was when they walked away at the same
time.  ... walked away...  as in every mob has his back turned to the hidden
rogue.  So even if he breaks hide and throws a dagger, since sneak did not
break, he is still indifferent to every mob except the one the dagger
hits...



-
(1) - The melee damage output in the 2 rogue, ranger, paladin, bard, cleric
group was just sick.  It was an assassinate mission, and we got a very
difficult map for that.   In the second room, it split off into two major
directions, with half the dungeon being to the west of the entrance, and the
other half to the east of the entrance.   Both sides had possible boss spawn
locations, and since it was just the second room, there was no way to know
which way we should take.   We went east and fought all the way to the east
edge of the map.   The boss spawned as we were killing one of the final
rooms.   And yep, you guessed it... the boss spawned at the westmost edge of
the dungeon.    We had to return to the entrance and clear the entire west
half of the dungeon in time to take down the boss.    So instead of clearing
half the dungeon and the boss, we had to do the entire thing.   We spawned
the boss with 65 of 90 minutes left on the clock, and killed him with 25
minutes remaining.   About 10 or 15 mobs left on track in the entire dungeon
when we did.
