The farmers still live... they are at

www.playerauctions.com

Verant have sent these people letters etc but they don't give a shit hehe

The only way this activity will ever stop is if Verant make more of the
desired items No Drop and stopped Multi questing. Imagine if the FBSS was No
Drop, would there be a 24/7 camp by the same people and would the AC be as
camped if the morons cant get the ring to multiquest for a few thousand
plat?

Perhaps they could make the items that drop in Veeshans Peak, Planes, and
the high lvl dungeons available for trade, then all the farmers can go farm
in areas more appropriate for their lvls.

I am not saying that I am guiltless on farming a little but I usually go to
fetch something for a twink or friend.
