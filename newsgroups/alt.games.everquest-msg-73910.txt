Both EQPrices.com and Allakhazam's will you give you prices on items for
free- you just can't get additional info, like server specific prices or
comments.

Also, EQPrices will only show you the first page of the returned results. So
if are you looking for the price on Cobalt Vambraces, and you search for
"cobalt",  you will not see the vambraces because it will not display on the
first page. However, if you search with the words "cobalt vambraces", you
will get what you are looking for.

Be warned though, that most of the prices on these sites are far from
accurate. The best way to find out prices is to watch what people are
auctioning them for, or simply ask for a price check in whatever zone serves
as your server's auction zone (usually EC or GFay.)

Good luck. Buying and selling is an inexact science.
