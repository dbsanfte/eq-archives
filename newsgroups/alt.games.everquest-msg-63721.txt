Not true.  I get a dynamic IP from my DSL provider, and Nortion
Internet Security reports that it blocks trojan attacks a couple of
times a week.

The only problem I have with Norton is that it does not play nice with
the new EQ patcher, and I have to disable it if there is a new patch. 
Apparently when the patcher downloads a new exe that then tries to
access the internet, Norton wants to pop up a warning window asking me
to configure a new rule.  Unfortunatly, the EQ exe is sitting there
blocking the windows message queue waiting for a response, so the
Norton window can't paint itself.  Deadlock.
