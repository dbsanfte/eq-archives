So, I collected the 3 items for the Cleansed Spirit of Antonica. Went to
North Karana to give them to the Withered Treant. He is NOWHERE to be
found?!
I then doublecheck on Allakhazam, and a post there said that this part of
quest was broken for players running the new UI.
Switch to old UI, start game. STILL NO TREANT!
Is he a timed spawn? Am I just being unlucky, and he was recently killed?
What the hell is going on?
Any info will be greatly appreciated.
