The advantage of the root/DoT method is that you're medding
while you kill something.   You have to figure in the downtime
that's associated with medding to get an idea of the efficiency.
As long as you're killing more mobs per hour, you're more
efficient.   The price you pay for that is longer times per kill;
the benefit you get is less downtime while you're not engaged.
