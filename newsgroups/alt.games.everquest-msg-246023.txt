I could see a few reasons, mainly when he started playing.

Many people nowdays do a certain 'pathway' if you will of levelling in 
very specific zones. I think the current popular path is newbie zone, 
paludal, dawnshroud or HHK, LDON.


I know I did west freeport, east commonlands, befallen/west commonlands, 
north karana, south karana, dreadlands, then different zones with groups 
and raids. Nowdays you can run through most of these zones and only find 
higher level characters farming or doing small quest parts.

It could also be the type of pairing, an enc/dru pair might handle mobs 
differently than a bst/druid and need a different type of mob to be the 
most efficient=) I know chanters can charm and do a different type of 
crowd control than a beastlord does=)
