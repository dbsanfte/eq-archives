Doesn't work anymore, has not for some time now.  They changed it so that 
a mob will always attack a player character over a pet if both are in 
melee range.  Aggro has nothing to do with it, so long as the player 
character is on the hate list.  Only way you might be able to get away 
with it is root, but, since pets seem to have a tendency to attack from 
as far away as they can, that has never really worked for me either.
