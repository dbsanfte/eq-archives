Okey, I'm just a n00b, I need more info than that... Are the mobs in the 
PoJ trials summoned that I can just nuke into oblivion with Banishment? 
Does that mean that highish-level Druids are sought after for those 
trials?

If so, I may give it another shot, although Banishment sounds kinda 
expensive. I don't have any level 60 or 61 spells yet. =/
