There were new people coming into EQ1 for a long time, heck, I didn't 
start until just prior to the second expansion coming out.  The first two 
expansions for EQ were excellent, the third one was good, after that 
things started going downhill.  There were still plenty of people joining 
the game at that stage, but PoP was probably the biggest step in the 
downhill slide for EQ1, at least for me.  I do still play, but basically 
only to raid now.  There is no telling what direction expansions will 
take in EQ2, judging from the patches though, they are listening to the 
customers, perhaps too much, much as the started to do with EQ1.
