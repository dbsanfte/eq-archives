Well, my 2 best ideas for good (and great) cash would be:

Good-  Qeynos, killing gopher snakes.  Jaws/skins/etc. sell for 2.5 gold
each
and you can easily make 50 - 75p an hour there once you make even levels
3-4.

Great-  Butcherblock Mounts killing goblins at about lev 6+.  Their heads
and blood still sell for 4P each (with bad charisma) and the cash is insane
for
mobs that low a level.

Chokepoints notwithstanding, best low level cash spots in the game that I've
found yet.
