Ok, belabored (sp?) issues and unneccessary nitpicking aside, I'll
chime in here and say that, whereas DT had a point to make, they made
it in a manner that implied a low level of intelligence in the OP's
question. It *was*, in fact, a valid question, and it *was* true that
one probably shouldn't expect a whole lot in the way of new UI
resources just yet.

My experience is that DT, though maybe a bit over-zealous on occasion,
is a valuable contributor to the group. Therefore, I would be inclined
to chalk it up as an ever-occurring case of misinterpreted post
context/connotation on JK's part.

That said, it should also be noted that one should know which way the
wind blows before they turn on the ol' flamethrower. There, helpful or
not, is my 2cp worth.

Gotta vouch for DT again here. It seems *you* are the one perpetuating
the *vomit rolling*.

Bah, I'm done with it.
