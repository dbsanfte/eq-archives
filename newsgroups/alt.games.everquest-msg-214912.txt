   I apologise too, then.  The problem with posting is that often time
the nuances of feeling don't translate.  I'm just glad that I considered
the possiblity rather than go into a full blown huff ala .... we, we all
know who.

   And here is another problem, I am proabably feeling a bit defensive
about being a group leader.  It is hard.  If there is a bad group, it is
my fault.  One over eager looter, puller, or whatever, it's my fault. 
Lack of communication lead to a wipeout?  My fault.  Being groupleader
is hard.  But to me, it is preferable to hanging around for hours
shouting "Lfg".

  I'd say more, but I have to go.  My teeth hurt.
