Playing your Wizard?  I think Fay hates Wizards.  Here's how the last Fay
killing I was at went.

1. After taking way too long, we finally get everyton there, buff up and
spawn Fay.

2. Fay is quickly taken down enough that it is time to nuke.

3. I run in and cast Ice Comet two or three times.  All are fully resisted.

4. Fay summons me and beats me to death very quickly.  I had a damage shield
on, so I *did* at least inflict *some* damage on that bastard.

5. Fay summons and beats to death someone else.  I don't recall for sure
what class they were, but I think it was either a Cleric or an Enchanter.

6. Fay dies.  Total deaths on our side: me and that other person.
