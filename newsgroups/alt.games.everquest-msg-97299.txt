Have you never heard of paragraphs... this was hard on the eyes.

Since you conveniently snipped all context, please enlighten me which
point you aren't agreeing with.

Gross generalization. Once again you fail to look at the specific
changes. They are not gamechanging effects. They are
nuisance-removers.

I have. I have pointed out the previous changes that were very similar
to these (probably even more major) *did not hurt EQ*. They made it
better, and if you want to argue about THAT I can't wait to hear it.
(referring to removing the spellbook at 35, adding the dungeon exp
bonus, removing exp penalties for hybrids, and cutting death penalties
in half. All of those had the effect of making leveling faster, and
*none* of them hurt the game in the way you are describing)


> Lokari in my opinion has

Well that's just super.

Clue repeated for one who has missed it: you didn't earn your
accomplishments the way I or many others did - by fighting through
what EQ was at RELEASE. Do you feel you are denied? Do you wish we had
original EQ back?

So, do you miss this feeling of accomplishment now that you are
actually *aware* of it? Must be pretty shadowy if you didn't even know
it existed.


> and b) It once again denies

>and healthy in the environs of Norrath.

Horseshit. Once again case grossly overstated. Reducing time from 1-10
will do nothing significant to hurt people's abilities. Removing hell
levels won't either. How much more do you learn after the 200th kill
in a level? 500th? Hell levels didn't educate people, they just tested
their patience.

Nothing has been given. Case overstated again.

>whole - only time will tell.

An unfair thing to demand; EQ is not likely to hold on to the top spot
forever but blaming this change would be rediculous.
