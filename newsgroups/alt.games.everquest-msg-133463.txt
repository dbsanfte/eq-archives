I'd like to add a question to this - when does it become 'worth' the rez 
effects?  I'm 28 now and I've been refusing rezzes because the effects 
seem to take longer to go away than it takes to get the exp back with a 
couple of kills.  But my last couple of deaths I feel like I've lost 
painful amounts of exp.  So is it starting to be worth the wait, or am I 
just starting to get impatient for level 30? :)

Ryou
