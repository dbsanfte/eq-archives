Because some other dink moved him out of position, and he keeps giving me 
that 'I'm too busy for that now!' crap.

But then -I'm- the one wishing they'd respawn quicker... Still, at the 
time, it was faster than getting ahold of a GM. :)

Alternately, in fairly rare cases, because the SOB aggroed me!  How dare 
he!  Or, because he gives a decent faction hit...  I remember slaughtering 
quite a few vendors in Skyshrine and Kael.  Many of whom I was unaware 
were vendors until they failed to leave a corpse.  :)
