I would disagree.  I started the game playing an enchanter in my attempt to
Role Play, and this character was my main for 2 years (retired now).  It may
be more difficult to learn with one of these classes, but not that much
harder.  After a while you just get the hang of it regardless of class.  If
you do find it too difficult, then try out one of the classes above, a
Ranger is probably the easiest to start with IMHO.

Yes, have fun, and remember that most people have never played an RPG in
their life.  If you really want to give it a college try and still play EQ,
try the Firiona Vie server.
