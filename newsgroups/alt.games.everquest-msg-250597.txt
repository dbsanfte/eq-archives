Much harder to get, marginally more powerful.  Once another reward for 
the much favored "high end raider", now pretty much a joke, since they 
tend to be superceded by level 65 spells... if not by level 63/64 ones, 
or even 61/62 ones!

When level 60 was as high as it went, these were essentially the level 
"61" spells that only the excedingly powerful and committed level 60s 
had.  Since nobody fitting that description stops at level 60, these 
days, the Ancient spells are largely just a historical oddity.

I'm sure some of the Hardcore players out there will be able to point 
out a few of the spells that are still uniquely powerful, even in a 
level 65 world.  Personally, given the effort required to acquire them, 
I'm happy to think of them -all- as outdated, rather than stew over the 
fact that I'm unlikely to ever see one.

Splendid
