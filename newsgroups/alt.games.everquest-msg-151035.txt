Been happening to me, even before the patch (Karana server). My other two
computers, which have no problems and can sit in the bazaar all day or run
the fields of Norrath, are screen freezing in the bazaar now, after the
patch. There were a lot of screen freezes going on after the patch as well
as some zone crashes. A lot of people died as a result of this. Guides
handles this very well, rezzes were prompt, even when we though we wouldn't
get one because the zone didn't come down. Have been working tradeskills
till they get things ironed out. A forge hasn't killed me yet. Eventually
they should get it fixed.
