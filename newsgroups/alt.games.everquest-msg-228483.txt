Tiny companion is level 19 for all pet classes for some reason, even 
though other spells are various levels for various classes, and it 
clearly could have been a 34 shaman spell, which is the first point at 
which you can actually use it.

Also crazy like this, Reclaim Energy, a spell -only- for mages (kill 
your pet, get some mana back), is level one... and mages don't get pets 
till level 4.  Further, it costs more mana to cast reclaim energy than 
you get back till you are over level 40!  Further still, mages can quest 
for an item (well, several) which give us insta click reclaim energy at 
no mana cost; why even bother making it a spell in the book at all, 
there are many similar spell effects off items that never appear in 
spell books.

At any rate, not only do you get a pet at 34, but you get one at every 
spell level thereafter till 50 or so, and upgrades every few spell 
levels after that.  The shaman pet is a very important part of the 
class, giving him good damage output and even crappy offtanking 
capability (the pet makes a fairly poor offtank), significantly better 
than the SK pet.  Its annoying that you wont' see this key component 
till 34, but thats SOE for you, making you learn how to play the game 
wrong for 33 levels.
