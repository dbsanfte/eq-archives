Translation:  Let them know that you are going to put them on your Ignore
list and not let them in any groups you are in from then on if they don't
cough up the 12 pp for the buff.

Your option on how polite you want to be.

Word of advice:
Start of in your group telling folks that it costs you 12 pp for that spell
and you aren't there so they get riich and you get poor (politely of
course -- along the lines of -- This buff costs me 12 pp a cast so I'll need
to loot a bit more often to make up the difference....  My enchanter lets
folks know when he is burning through gems with Rune 3 (Rune 4 isn't worth
the upgrade to peridot for the few hp...) saving folks if they get to 20
health and the cleric hasn't healed them yet (we all get lag spikes -- it
just tends to be a bit more lethal when the cleric gets one).  I've yet to
have a group where someone (or the group) decide that I needed to either
loot more or they coughed up the pp to offset my costs.
