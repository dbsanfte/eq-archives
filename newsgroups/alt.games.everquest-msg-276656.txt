That's probably high for full-time play for fun.  I'd expect it's low if you
play as if it were work.  If you concentrate on working efficiently, playing
those servers with the most customers, camping only items which sell well, and
truly optimizing your use of time, and being willing to do some trading
(buy low, sell high) in addition to selling items you acquire yourself, I'd
guess you can double that figure, probably more.

Umm, not enough to quit your cushy first-world professional job, maybe.  It's
a huge step up for workers in many places in the world, and in the US for
a small-fraction-but-large-number of adults.

Fortunately (for those who don't like the practice), the market is very
limited, and won't be able to support many professionals.

Yes.  The resentment comes from that.  The market ALSO comes from that.  There
are haves and have-nots in the amount of time/energy available to play too.

Some who have time and no money feel their time gets devalued by real money
sales.  Some trade time for money by selling items.  Some who have money and
no time feel like they'll never catch up, and get frustrated with the game.
Some trade money for time and buy items.

What of the person who doesn't have time to grind out levels and still wants to 
play/compete?
