    Not even when buffed with Skin Like/cleric Courage line, and Symbol?

    Many ENCHs I know have hit this stage. One item really helps a lot: your
headpiece from Hate. Insidious Halo has crazy stats - something like 20 CHA
7 INT.

    My level 30 ENCH has AC/HP earrings and rings, and sits at 150 INT/CHA
self-buffed. Only expensive twink item is GEBs, and if I switched the
Crystal Webshield out for a Stein of Moggok then losing the GEBs wouldn't
lower INT. So far <knock on wood>, that's been good enough for everyday
adventuring.
