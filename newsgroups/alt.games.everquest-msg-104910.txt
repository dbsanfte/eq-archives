    AoE can be done a lot of places. One of the big places for it is
Sebilis, when there isn't too many folks in the zone.

    I did it last night. At first it was just me, one wizard, and an
enchanter in Fungus Grove. Steep learning curve, the enchanter died on the
second pull (we just managed to kill all the mobs), but after that I got a
feel for mana allocation and everything went swimmingly the rest of the
night. The grandest pull was when we briefly had three enchanters, two
clerics, and the wizard - the wizard pulled just about every mushroom in
Fungus Grove, along with all the Shadel Bandits and all the Mutant Dregs and
we blew them all up. That pull got me a full yellow of alt XP. I'd never
even imagined a cleric could have that much fun. Doing 2 K damage per mob,
over Brell knows how many mobs we had - it was a rush. I'm hooked now. :-) I
just might get Mass Group Buff soon yet!
