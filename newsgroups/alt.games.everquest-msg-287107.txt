For me, corpse finding wasn't about fear, it was anxiety.  At the low
levels, it didn't really matter, but if I had lost the gear on my high
level enchanter, I probably would have just bagged it and quit the
game. Corpse runs could be exciting (try being an kos bound in Qeynos
and running across a couple of zones to your corpse), but I had a few
times where it was way past my bedtime, I needed to get some sleep so
I could work the next day, and I was running around trying to find my
corpse, gradually going crazier and crazier.

I don't miss that at all.
