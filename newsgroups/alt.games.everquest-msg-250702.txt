Heck, even if it's not all that challenging, a SOW is a big plus.
I was duoing the minotaurs in Steamfont the other night, and had
to do a couple of CRs back from my bindpoint in PoK.  Sure, taking
the book and running across Steamfont doesn't take long, and if I
didn't immediately find a SOW I'd just start running, but if there's
a SOW available it means I can get back there a bit faster, which
can mean a lot to my groupmate who's still out there.

In general, though, when I look for SOW in PoK I'm prepared to pay.
(Not a lot; I can buy potions for 7-8pp a dose, so I usually offer
5 for a SOW.)  If I call it a CR, I'm telling the truth.

And on the flip side, when I'm playing my druid and offering SOW
(which I always do if I hear someone asking for it), I don't ask
for donations, but people seem to donate more often than not.  And
the ones who don't are often naked, so I could easily believe they're
on CRs whether they mention it or not.

p.s.: The above-mentioned druid is one of those much-denigrated
halflings.  I try NOT to live down to their reputation. :-)
