The only time i've gotten anything was from a fisherman in WC.  He only gave
me one copper.  My faction with him was kindly so I think the likelihood of
getting something depends on your faction.  When I'm waiting for a trip to
or from luclin I always beg from the scions just to get the skill up.  Never
know when it may actually be useful.
