Aye.  The one beef I have heard over and over from Mages is that they
are totally lacking in crowd-control, once their pet is occupied they
are SOL if there's an add.  Shaman covers that with root, and has a
very nice selection of spells besides that.

Also, if they want a decent Mana Preservation focus (I know the Mage can
summon stuff, but permanent items have their advantages), and they both
have PoP (for mobility) they can easily do the Fine Antique Ring quest
from Holly in the PoK museum, and get good XP for the mobs they need to
kill for 3 of the four drops (the fourth can just be bought off vendors
in Shar Vahl, it drops off newbie mobs).  My Druid was able to do the
quest solo at L29, with a pet class they should have less risk than I
did because they can sic the Gimp on the Snow Griffon and hightail it
for the zone.
