This is suprising.  Have they really changed?  Again, I've been gone for
about six months, so if VI has changed in their views of customer service,
then it's news to me.

I sure hope so, but since I've gotten back on Monday, I've only seen downed
servers, and major changes at the expense of Druids.

Still, if you tell me they've changed, I'll take you at your word and back
off for awhile to see if it's so.  MY experience has been otherwise, and it
certainly hasn't looked any different since Monday, but I'll give you the
benefit of the doubt.

Neither did I.
