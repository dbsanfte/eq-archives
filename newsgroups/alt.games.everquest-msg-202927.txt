Ahhhh, like a moth to the flame he comes running.

No, you won't ... and you've just proven why.  You're too much of a keyboard
warrior to let anyone else have the last word.

Even after telling you my reasoning for continuing on with this, you still
come back for more.  I was actually willing, seen as how you completely blew
off my attempt to help you with suggestions of RPG games with less downtime,
to continue the discussion.  However, when you started stalking me into
other threads that were totally unrelated to KEI, I decided to have some fun
with you.

I've been around USENET a long time, and I've seen your type before.  It
won't end until I plonk you and stop responding.  I have a point I'm trying
to see if I can get you to reach ... once you're there, you're a goner.
Without ceremony, without a good-bye message.

I'm only going to respond in this thread.  I say this for two reasons ... 1)
You won't have to track me down, and 2) Everyone else who already hasn't can
put the thread on ignore to save their time.

C'mon ... I know you're not going to give up now.  You wouldn't dare give me
the last word.

Crash
