Only a little bit.

First, Paladins have had "rez" (i.e., "Resurrect", the
90% rez) at level 59 for a very long time.  This doesn't
change under the new spell line-up.  And we got Revive
(0% rez, good only for getting you back to your corpse)
at 49.  Oddly enough, we didn't get the 50% rez anywhere
in between, which would have made sense.

Second, Paladins still get a given rez spell much later
than Clerics do -- at any given level, Clerics will
still be desired for their *better* rez.  (Plus Clerics
also get "better, sooner" rezzes at most levels under
the "new" spell scheme -- they can Revive at level *14*,
and get their first partial-exp rez at 19, etc.)

Finally, Clerics at level 39+ will *always* be indispensable,
if for no other reason than their Complete Heal.

But the great news about these changes is that it makes
the game less of a strain on *everyone*.  Your odds of
getting an exp rez will go up dramatically, *and* (partial)
rezzes will be available for lower-level people more often.

Plus, imagine how much more willing people will be to
start exploring dungeons as lowbies, now that the cleric,
starting at level 14, (or Paladin!, starting at 22) in
the group can just yank them back to resume fighting
whenever a death occurs, instead of tedious, dangerous
corpse runs not only from bind point to the dungeon,
but down into the dungeon to meet back up with the group
as well.

This is a *great* change, and will make the game a *lot*
more fun -- less exp loss, fewer corpse runs, and
more incentive to be adventurous.
