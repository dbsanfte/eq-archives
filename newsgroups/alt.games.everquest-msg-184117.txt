Not at all.

I pulled rat after rat to the entrance area, snared, and feared tham. 
They simply pathed back inside but never far enough to pull adds.  Let
fear break, kite them back to the GY.  Repeat.  The primary danger of
adds comes during the pull, and of course this is true regardless of
whether you fear them once you get them out.

-This did not endanger anyone who wasn't already fighting.  (No aggro
from rats in PoJ for those who haven't been there)
-This did not exploit any pathing bugs.  (There is one inside and one
in the GY that I purposefully avoided.)
-This was not safe at all, especially at 55, since rats and guards
still add until 56+.  Also, Sralm Noramir will aggro to the GY at 55
and he is not walk in the park for a solo ranger.

I see a lot of reasons why they took this out.  Some claim it was to
solve the pathing issue.  Personally I think they did it because
people were getting too much experience doing it.  The sooner you
reach 55, 60, 65 or whatever, the sooner you tire of the game and get
a job.  (But I always find it interesting how many experts there are
who know exactly what the programmers were thinking).

In any case, we still have other zones where we can fear kite.
