With the characters you have on the account, don't bother.  Only reason
someone would buy it would be to save money on buying the expansions, but,
in doing so, taking the risk of you taking back your account whenever you
felt like it, with no recourse for them.  So, EULA considerations aside, it
is quite unlikely you could even find someone who would want to buy it.
