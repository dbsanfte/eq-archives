Where did you get that idea? The actual instanced item never leaves
the servers.

Wee.. time to dust off the old programming. 

Its an interesting non-programmer way of putting it. Flags tend to be
a 1/0 terminology. Like either being flagged for Tactics or not.
Either having a BoC or not. In the latter reference that's not how it
works. What 'should' happen is that when you log in an instance for
the player you play gets created from your account information in
file. If you have a BoC the item number for that should be stored
along with the item numbers for each of the augments it uses. That
instanced item then gets created and a reference to the memory is
placed in the player instance at the proper spot... i.e.. a bag slot
in its inventory or your primary/secondary slots depending on if they
are equipped. When you trade that item to someone else.. the reference
to the memory location for the item is transferred to the other user..
and it gets linked to their first open inventory slot. When they camp
or /q the server should dump the data from the player back into file
format and destroy all open objects, so in fact.. you could say the
data did change hands.. because the only one who can recreate the item
is the one who received the reference to the item, and thereby had
their account updated with the item links.

It is the same with Everquest because references to transferred data
are not kept. I would think your typical dupe bug is a result of a
reference inadvertently being kept so that two players point to the
same item on the EQ server... and when they log both account files get
updated with that item before the objects are destroyed. But that is
purely a bug in the program which then allows them both able to create
an instance of the item when they log in and you gain an extra
duplicate of an item in game. But in the standard way a game
operates.. when a reference is transferred the pointer is nulled out
or written over with a new item reference. You simply lose the ability
to have access to that item having traded it.

I could download the data for "Blade of Carnage" off Allakhazam. That
isn't a Blade of Carnage. You can only get access to another Blade of
Carnage object by having the reference to the item passed to you from
another player, or you can get it after creation.. and the only way
that happens is in the only non-bug way this game allows, spawn the
Avatar of War.

I saw above. You still need to explain how in a bug-free enviornment
if i transfer a BoC from myself to you that either an extra copy of
the instance has been made.. or the reference to it is kept. Neither
is the case. I hand you an item.. it transfers the reference and nulls
out or replaces it with a new reference. Only one reference to a
dynamic item residing in server memory should ever exist at any point
and time and therefore you have no copies being made.

Simply not the way it works, sorry. You cannot hand me a BoC in-game
and still keep it. Feel free to try it though :>.

It would help if you understood programming better.

Reference '42''s excellent post on the matter. If you want to argue
that Everquest represents a gaming league bound by rules of the EULA..
i'm there and will be the first to say SoE has the right to regulate
their account access the way they see fit. But trying to claim it
illegal under federal copyright law and claim Sony has any type of
recourse in the courts under copyright infringement and what not is
laughable to say the least. They have the right to ban people from
their league based on conduct per their rules, and that's about it.

And the transfer is regulated and dictated by their system. Once
again.. league with rules? sure.. illegal under state and federal laws
per copyright infringment/intellectual property and what not? Hardly.
You keep searching for something against the law here, there isn't
anything. You won't suddenly see companies raided by the FBI for
selling virtual items in a computer game. The IRS maybe, if they don't
pay the taxes on the income :>.
