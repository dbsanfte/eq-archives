OK, so I've been helping a druid friend with her epic on and
off the past few weeks.  We've taken care of everything
that doesn't require a raid sized force, except for the
Corrupted Brownie.

We did the Corrupted Seafury in OOT, got the tainted
down to almost dead and kept him that way till we were
both FM... and then were only able to take the Corrupted
down to half health before we were both OOM.  Died,
got a couple tanks, and went back and took him down
easily.

So, the question is, what are we in for when we get the
corrupted brownie to pop?  I chatted briefly with a friend
who said it took two groups in the 50s to kill him, it
seems he's a caster (the regular brownie scouts we've been
killing trying to spawn the tainted are too) in his 50s, and
gave them some trouble.

My thought is that if he is the same level as the corrupted
seafury, we can use the same two tanks (49 monk, 51 warrior)
and take a caster mob down faster than that giant, no worries...
but I certainly can't speak from experience there.

Druid snares, cleric fears, both keep laying on the stuns while
the tanks chop the target to ribbons.  Any reason this shouldn't
work?
