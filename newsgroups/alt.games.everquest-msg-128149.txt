No he is there, under the world. He won't agro on you; but I did wait
till a green MoB ran past the same spot he was "under" and dropped a
AE. I got him, he hit me, appeared on my target screen. All my spells
landed, but he never popped above the world, even after I ran off the
mountain he was under. He kept hitting me through the surface though,
I zoned out, except for exp, I wouldn't get to loot so I didn't
bother.
