Find a style of play that fits how you'd like to spend your time. If you
like your guild, then stay with them, really who cares what others think? If
these are your friends then have fun!

If you like bending to the will of the masses, then ditch your guild (who
may get all pissed cause they oufitted you), and join the thrall. There are
many other guilds and people who make EQ great!

Whatever your decision, make sure it's how you'd like to play EQ.
