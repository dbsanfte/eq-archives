    My experiences have always been that a melee pounding on any mob I've
rooted leads to root breaking early. Maybe it was procs off the tanks'
weapons, or maybe it was just me looking for a scapegoat every time a root
broke. :-)  I swear, a cleric pulls a mob to root-nuke it, and ten melees
are on it banging away in seconds screaming "ARE YOU OK? DON'T WORRY, I'LL
SAVE YOU!" Yet you know who the mob goes after once that root breaks, sigh.

    (A) Invest in Shrink potions, the Jenny Craig of Norrath. Fat, begone!
    (B) Are the quarters so cramped that the main tank can't consistently
stay closer than the other tanks? Are the other tanks running to attack
before your main tank? Are things so cramped that the other tanks can't back
up until the main tank gets root aggro, and if so how are your tanks even
getting into position in the first place?

    Tanks hate adapting to anything. Try and change a puller's pull rate
sometimes - it's like they're hard-coded with one, or perhaps two, pull
rates and can't deviate from those speeds. Try and get a tank to rotate to
allow certain classes to attack at certain angles - either they do it when
they join the group, or it's like pulling teeth all session long. The melee
model seems to be "zerg the crap out of the pulls!"

    Example: my warrior was in DL at 45 (yeah, lazy me). I'd go pull a mob
while the last one was running, bring it back (facing it as it was
incoming), then when it arrived charge it with attack on and spin it so its
back was facing the party. That way I'd always know, even with slowed mobs,
if I had aggro and my party would have the back of the mob to beat on.
Sounds easy, right? Explain it to them once and everything should work,
right? Nuh-uh. The first group thought I was a rogue with aggro issues
(guess the blue plate was too subtle) until one person finally asked why I
wasn't evading. They kept trying to taunt off me. The second group, the
other plate tanks kept rotating to my side of the mob because "that's where
the taunt is!" The third group, the rogue kept going to my side because he
figured with more people on the other side, the mob would turn that way.

    I wish I could write this off to "inexperienced people in DL", but I see
it everywhere. In King in Sebilis, I've encountered one group that
understood the importance of pinning the mobs in the corner so wanderers
don't CHeal them. Every other group, even once I explain to them what to do
and why to do it, still end up pushing the mobs all over the place. I get
forced into memming Force and Sound of Force and physically pushing the mobs
into the corner with knockback stuns while the tanks spin in place,
wondering why the mob is now behind them. Why am I doing the positioning?

    Good tanks are awesome when you get them. When I see someone move to the
right place, it makes me smile because I know I won't have to heal as much.
I also find that tanks learn stuff pretty well, but on a delayed basis -
they won't use a new technique well the session they learn about it, but
next session will use it consistently. But adapting to something new is
something I find they do NOT do well. Wish I understood the psychology of
it. :-)

    Ok, this is driving me nuts. I'm trying to remember a single instance
where a gargoyle ran on my party, and can't. Are they runners (I really
can't remember)? If not, how was the pet being an earth pet (as opposed to
any other crazy, uncontrolled pet) messing you up?

    Surprised you don't hate pets and mages in general after that. :-/  Once
a pet is fighting something you want to mez, you either have to get the
"something" to hit someone else while the pet is backed off, or
(preferrable) chain-stun the add while the pet is backed off and mez is
applied. I love wading in with stuns when I see a pet messing up the ENCH -
makes me feel like I'm doing crowd control, which is fun to do.

    Ok, this example confuses me. I'm thinking of the dogs in Velk's and the
'shrooms and ICGs in Sebilis when I think of CHealing mobs, to give you some
idea where I'm coming from. Which of these mobs move to get somebody once
they start trying to CHeal (unless the CHeal goes off)? If you were just
chain-stunning a healer, whether it was rooted or not, the tanks would have
to move to stay with it anyways if your stuns have a knockback component.
How is rooting the mob changing that? It's more an issue with runners than
healers.

    I can name an example, but it isn't typical. My cleric likes to partner
with rogues when waiting for a more-rounded group. When I do, I use root not
only as ghetto snare (along with stuns) but also to keep mobs on me and not
on the rogue.  I find I can channel enough heals on myself/stun the active
mob enough that we do pretty well, better than if I stood back and healed
the rogue as he tanked. I haven't done this since I got my Boots of
Stability, but I'm really looking forward to trying them out. In the only
test so far of the Boots' special ability (plus ten percent to Channeling),
I channeled Celestial Elixir (level 59 heal over time) on myself through an
avalanche golem, Frosticube, and one of those tentacle things under Icewell
Keep beating on me.
