That would depend on how well the guild is run, but in my experience
if the ranger shows up to help in more raids than the warrior, the
ranger would be higher on the merit list. Class usefulness doesn't
enter into it. Everyone is useful in their own way, and it's not their
fault if some encounters make them less useful than they would be in
others.

Another example would be that druids and rangers of tunare don't lose
merit or seniority for missing PoG. If the guild leadership is good
it's a non issue.

Culling out the lootwhores is something every uberguild tries to do.
People rag on their maturity but on many if not most the servers the
TOP guild actually handles the loot issues far better than more
"mature" guilds, and their members are more group oriented.

It's a weird system, but a powergamer is actually far more likely to
be generous and easy about uberloot than a casual gamer. Many top
uberguilds may treat the rest of the server with disdain but when it
comes to their own members and allies they are extremely fair.

Funny, huh?

Like the other guy said, for the most part, if you got something
significant in a guild raid, and later you get something better,
you're expected to give back what the guild got you so it can be given
to another person to use, or, if no one can, to be sold for guild
money (possibly to guild twinks). You're perfectly welcome to do
anything you want with anything the guild didn't help you get (say if
you came from a guild that disbanded to a new guild) though they would
probably look on it extremely favorably if you passed it down anyways.
