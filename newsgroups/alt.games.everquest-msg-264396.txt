In EQLive after I hit every level I would go park somewhere and continually 
cast a nuke until my Evocation maxed 5 pts, and then repeat with all my 
other skills. This made my casting more reliable, but did this make me more 
skillful in play? I stlil wound up casting the same spells that were 
available to anyone else. I chose them differently perhaps in battle, just 
as we do in EQ2. This isn't any different, but what is different is the 
change abandoning the old underlying spell skills like Evocation, 
Alteration, etc.

EQ2 doesn't maintain this underlying casting skill system as a driver of 
spell potency. Instead it offers other things like the spell masteries and 
Adept III's. Have you obtained any of the spell masteries? I have, and I can 
tell you that there is a HUGE difference between my Smite and any other 
player who has not achieved spell mastery and that difference is based on 
the fact that I went out and completed a quest to improve my mastery over a 
particular family of mobs (in this case, Skeleton Mastery). My Skeleton 
Mastery Smite does double the damage of my ordinary Smite when I'm fighting 
skeletons. Likewise with Goblin Mastery, Gnoll Mastery, etc. The good 
players are going to distinguish themselves both by being better players on 
their feet, and by virtue of how hard they work at improving their spell 
masteries via quests, and not by how much time they spend casting nukes on 
themselves to raise Evocation.

Also, see my comment regarding Adept III skills. Not many players are 
running around with Adept III's, and in my experience, they are choosing 
them differently all the time. How many Adept III's do you have as a 22 
Wizard? As a Scholar, I make Adept III's and I see the requests in Trader 
channel daily and hourly asking for Adept IIIs, to which I have to reply "I 
can make you one, but you have to bring me one of the rares". When they do 
finally get a rare and bring it to me for the final combine, I'm amazed at 
the different emphases that people choose to enhance. One player will spend 
his rare on his Taunt for an Adept III taunt. God bless him. Another will 
enhance his DD with an Adept III Smite. Still others will enhance their 
Backstab, and so on. I've made Adept III's for each of these mentioned, and 
in the 10 or so that I've made I honestly don't think that I've done the 
same one twice. I chose to Adept III my Daring, and my group buffage is much 
more powerful as a result, than the buffs that players many levels above me 
can offer. That was my choice. So this is yet another example of how players 
will distinguish themselves in battle. Not just on the basis of the spells 
that they choose to mash in battle (this will remain pretty similar in 
EQLive or EQ2), but on the basis of how well they can handle the new model 
of multiple mobs at once, as well as the homework that preceded the battle 
and how much effort they made to enhance the key aspects of their skills 
that actually *can* distinguish you if you make the effort.
