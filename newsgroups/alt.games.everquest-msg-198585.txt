And thats another thing they fucked up royally . Every caster who plays
wants there spells and they restricted getting spells to zones that require
raid forces to acheive. Spectrals are fairly easy to get in hoh, tactics or
bot. Runes are fairly easy to get in elementals . All of the above require
raid forces to get to so by definition leave 90% of the people out.

Nerfing the mephit and consort drops has got to be one of the stupidest
things they ever did. It acted as a safety valve for the people in family
guilds that had leveled above their friends. Also now there is absolutely no
reason to hunt in either place unless you are doing tradeskills. So now
tradeskillers have to beg and plead to start a mephit or consort group.
