I agree with the concept, but not the statement that it's an artificial
classification.  It is a very real classification that describes real
physiological characteristics.  Of course, I also approach this from an
artists' standpoint, where the classifications are very useful in knowing
general racial characteristics and being able to draw them correctly.

Anyways, rambling aside, race should not matter, but it's far from
artificial.  I'll give you arbitrary, though.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
