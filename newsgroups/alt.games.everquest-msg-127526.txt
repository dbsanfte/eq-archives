AKA hit box. The invisible ring in which you have to stand to be close
enough to avoid the 'You cannot hit your target from here' OOR melee
messages

We love AEing (Zoneline to Burrower is usually 1-2 pulls max each side
of the bridge), but we've never AEed the early waves. I suspect they're
unstunable for a start.

The early waves are trivially easy to stabilise if you get someone
tanking each of them. war, sk, pal, rng, mnk can all reliably tank
without being too much of a drain. The only problem you have is killing
them fast enough to recover before the next round. We usually group-
assist the first few rounds, then switch to MT assist later. The first
rounds don't have enough hps to put the entire raid on, since DPS will
drop as half the raid won't have hit the mob by the time it's dead. In
the later waves you still need to drop them asap, but mob's damage
output (ands hence healing requirements) are much higher, so you want to
reduce the numbers as fast as possible, and they have enough hps to make
it worthwhile to have everyone assist

Always a good idea to run statue unslowed to guage your AoW chances.
Churn out a lot of mod rods, and save a few MGBs for quicker recovery.

Never plan to have 2 attempts on AoW - you want everyone giving their
all from the start. Long recast discs or AA skills shouldn't be saved
for a 'second attempt' when you can do him first attempt if you use him.

As you said, barely doable with one group, as long as it's near
perfectly set up, with highly skilled players in above average
equipment. 2 groups work well pulling in different directions and
helping out when the annoying wanderers respawn.

I'm assuming you mean the pyramid through the maze, rather than the one
across courtyard from zone. If so, LIzard earring drops from the named
brown lizzies (better than mosquito), high level axe (12/17 70dd fire
proc or something) from the corner browns, 85hp mask from names at top
of pyramid. Lots of decent high end stuff in CT, just really hard to get
(probably as it should be, given the quality)
