Hey at least they claim to have fixed that second bug that caused the
hang-up.  It is nice that they finally admitted it was a bug, since for a
year and a half they have been blaming it on players computers and ISPs.  I
am glad it is finally fixed, if in fact it is fixed, but see no reason to
trust their creditability since it took them so long to acknowledge it as a
bug.
