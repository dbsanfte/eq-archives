I think the answer there is most will try, in the same way as most tried
DAoC.
Any further speculation of that is pointless as we don't even have a beta to
go on, just some movies of animation and some screen shots.
If it's good, then yes. If SOE's team can capture the same feel of original
EQ with the slickness of Dark Age then they can have my money but just the
fancy graphics won't do it. I just hope they haven't got another bunch of
hormonal teenagers to design the new models, or the last bunch have grown up
a little and learnt the meaning of the word "proportion."
