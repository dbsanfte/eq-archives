MEXICO CITY - A magnitude 7.8 earthquake rocked west-central Mexico late =
Tuesday, killing at least 21 people and sending panicked residents into =
the streets of major cities.

The quake -- centered in the Pacific coast state of Colima, about 310 =
miles west of Mexico City -- struck shortly after 8 p.m. local time and =
lasted about 50 seconds, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).

Mexico's national seismological service put the quake's magnitude at =
7.6.

In the Bay Area's Mexican-American community, nervous relatives =
frantically tried to reach loved ones, but came up against jammed phone =
lines.

``I just found out about the earthquake. We're trying to get through, =
but we can't,'' said Oakland resident Guadalupe Mora. Her grandmother =
still lives in Jalisco. ``I'm a little afraid.''

Christian Rodriguez was one of the lucky ones who got through. He was =
worried until he spoke to his mother and siblings in Ciudad Zamora in =
Michoac=E1n state, just southeast of Colima. They were OK.

Rodriguez, a cook at the Tacos al Carbon Restaurant in East San Jose's =
Mi Pueblo Shopping Center, was sitting with co-workers on red leather =
bar stools Tuesday night, watching news of the quake on Univision.

He had lived in Colima for five years and was worried about friends =
there. It was a seismically active region, he recalled, with a volcano =
on the outskirts of town that often spewed out smoke and stones.

Early reports said the powerful quake knocked out electricity and phone =
lines but did not cause major damage in Mexico City. In Colima, Gov. =
Fernando Moreno said at least 19 people were killed, nine in the city of =
Colima, the state capital, and dozens more were injured as walls and =
homes collapsed. Two others died in neighboring Jalisco state.

Mexican President Vicente Fox ordered the military to search for damage =
in the region, which includes remote villages in the states of Colima, =
Michoac=E1n and Jalisco.

Still, as the extent of damage continued to be assessed, USGS =
public-affairs officer Butch Kinerney said scientists expect =
``substantial damage'' because of the size of the earthquake and its =
shallow depth.

Ricardo S=E1nchez was working on the computer in his house in Manzanillo =
-- close to the epicenter -- when the quake hit.

``Everything began to move; it was very strong,'' S=E1nchez said less =
than an hour after the quake, adding that he had felt several =
aftershocks. ``Some of the furniture fell. Everyone left the house and =
went outside to see what was happening.

``We felt some fear. Now, many people are outside.''

Internet communications and international calls were affected for hours.

According to the USGS, the last major quake in the region struck the =
fishing resort of Manzanillo on Oct. 9, 1995, and measured magnitude =
8.0. It killed at least 49 people and caused extensive damage in Colima =
and the neighboring state of Jalisco.

In Mexico City -- where a magnitude 8.0 earthquake killed an estimated =
10,000 people and destroyed a large part of the city in 1985 -- =
residents Tuesday night ran out of homes, offices and restaurants in =
panic. Firefighters, ambulances and police with wailing sirens combed =
the city in search of injured people and toppled buildings.

But they reported treating only some people with ``nervous attacks.'' =
Many residents stood on sidewalks weeping.

Soon after the quake hit, Inga Varelmann, co-owner of Hotel La Posada in =
Manzanillo, gathered about 50 guests in the lobby. Scared and shaken, =
they held candles and waited for the lights to turn back on. It took =
only 15 minutes.

``It felt like it would really come down, but it didn't,'' Varelmann =
said late Tuesday. ``I was standing between the kitchen and dining room =
screaming.''

The hotel, although close to the earthquake's epicenter, suffered little =
damage. A few glasses and chandeliers fell down, but little else.

``The jolt was very strong, but we're all OK,'' she said. ``We're very =
grateful.''

There also was no apparent damage in the coastal resort city of Puerto =
Vallarta to the north, said Laura Gonzales, manager on duty for the =
Costa Club Punta Arena.

``Most of the people that worry about it are people from the U.S.,'' she =
said.

Those in the Bay Area with connections to the west-central part of =
Mexico were hoping for the best in the absence of reaching relatives by =
phone Tuesday night.

Gilberto Coria, a retired machinist who lives in Redwood City, was glued =
to his television set Tuesday night as he listened to the latest reports =
on Mexican television via satellite.

Coria immigrated to the United States from a town near Colima state and =
has family members who live in and around the coastal town of L=E1zaro =
C=E1rdenas, south of Colima. He said he didn't try calling them Tuesday =
night because he knew the phone lines would be down.

``We worry about our family members,'' Coria said. ``But we're relieved =
that there's no major damage that we know of yet.''
