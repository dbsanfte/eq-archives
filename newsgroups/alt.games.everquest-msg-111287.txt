First, I don't see the current situation changing.

Second, any suggested replacement for the current method of
obtaining some high-level spells via NPC drops has to account for
all of the reasons that mechanism exists in-game.   Any "sell them
all at vendors" or "let a skill be developed to copy them" scheme
ignores one of the reasons they're dropped in the first place:  they
force characters to group in certain areas and kill certain mobs
or to spend money (and sometimes substantial money) to buy
them from players who do group in those areas or kill those mobs.

Third, I believe it was assumed by the developers that not all
players would get all spells.   That's even more true now with the
Ancient line of spells.  I know several 60s, even in top-5 guilds,
who don't have all their spells.   It's fairly common for clerics, for
instance, to not get some of their 55+ spells for levels.after they
could have scribed them.   Any system which means all players
get all spells circumvents, at least in part, the designer's intent.
