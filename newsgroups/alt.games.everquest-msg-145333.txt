My little level 9 Barbarian Shaman got an invite to a guild today.  Only
"requirement" is that we abide by the play-nice policy and not be an evil
class/race.  So I was like, Cool, I'll join.  Come to find out that most of
the people are like 50+ and I guess are just looking for youngins to help
out.  I'm all about the help, just thought I'd ask on here if anyone knows
much about this guild.  It is Society of Valor.  Curious if they have a
reputation or not.  Thanks.

By the way, my 9 Shaman is my first class ever to reach SoW level.  WOOT.
:)
