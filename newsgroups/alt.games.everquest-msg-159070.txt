I use a PlusNet ConnectBiz Account for EQ (playing on ISDN as well)

Cost is 40 quid a month but there are no cutoffs (been online for 18 hours
once or twice trading)
For your money you get about 84 hours a week so approx 12 hours a day, 4:1
connect
ratio and 500 mb of web space.
I have been using Plus Net for a year or so now and never had any real
problems with getting online etc.
