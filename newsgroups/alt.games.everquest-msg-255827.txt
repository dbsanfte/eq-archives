After a certain point in the game, yes this is true.  Rangers melee will
outdamage archery given equal quality weapons.  Warriors will outmelee
rangers, by a tiny amount, but ranger nukes will bring them over the
warriors DPS, IF the nukes are not just resisted (which is often the case,
we only have fire / cold / summoned nukes with no resist mods).

Yes when they are using elemental weapons in places like BoT they sure do
look impressive.  Once an hour they can double that DPS, though for exp
groups it has limited value (trueshot).

Well if warriors can tank, AND do the same DPS as a ranger, what is the
point of a ranger on a raid?  There is nothing they can do that is unique.

I still think it is a great class, but yes, there are some problems at the
higher end and also at the lower end, a ranger is only powerful when things
are heavily skewed in their favour due to droppable weapons available.
