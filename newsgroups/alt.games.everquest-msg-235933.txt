Just bought my wife the least expensive one for our wedding [EQ] and found
that those one's I can keep up with without even needing SOW, so the cheap
ones are not for speed and escape....

Read up on them before and a lot of people say lizards because the horses
head is in the way for spells - I think that probably depends on what camera
you use - I alway use a chase cam view backed well off - can alway see whole
field of combat that way...
