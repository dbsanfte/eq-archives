Oh no,  wouldnt want to check my email, send some ICQs, check EQ
ATLAS, or any of the things i can do while your playing UO or AC or
anyother properly designed game.  

There is no reason for an online game to not be alt-tabable, its an
intentional effort not to prevent some sort of Cheating, its easy
enough to work around for that, its intended to keep you in
sony/verants space while your on the net.   Its a control thing.  

but with  a fast computer today and plenty of RAM there is no reason
for it.  hey Verant my machine can multitask OK? 

i would play EQ alot more if i could be assured of doing it along with
perhaps getting some other stuff done.
