Try WoW or EQ2 or Guild Wars and you will think that EQ is populated by
rocket scientists.  The community of those games, WoW in particular, truly
makes me fear for the future of the human race if this is how the kids are
turning out these days.

First person perspective makes measuring "by eye" easy.  I can tell someone
to move forward 50 feet and they'll generally end up about where they
should, even though "50 feet" has no real in-game meaning.  I think /loc
coordinates "feel" like about 6 inches, but I've never used /loc much so I
may be way off.  =)
