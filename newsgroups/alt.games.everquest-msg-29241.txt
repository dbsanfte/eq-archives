While it's rare that I go LD (*nod to the gods*) I've run into the same thing.  In
upper Guk, some time back, was camping the Frogloc Realist. Three spawns in that
room, and I hadn't had time to really split them up yet, but they were all high
green, so I was handling them solo with no problem. (Hey, I was bored, ok?) Same
thing. Went link dead fighting the first one, logged back in to find three dead
froggies.
   I'm assuming here (and we all know how dangerous that is) that this is because
of the "you fight like and NPC until you disappear" factor of going LD.  That would
tell me that you would likely respond to anything that attacks you and gets on your
"hate list", and likewise, you'd attack anything that's "KOS" to you if it's within
your NPC aggro range.
  Of course, I may be completely full of shit, since I'm only guessing, but hey! It
sounds pretty good for a SWAG.
