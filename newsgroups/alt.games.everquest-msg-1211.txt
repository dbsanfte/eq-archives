> Why does everyone keep ragging on Verant Customer service?

Because the GMs don't spend every on-line second wiping the
asses and handing out blowjobs to the small group of pissy,
runny-nosed fuckheads who seem to think they own the game
and everything in it.  These people believe they are the only
people in the game, and that the 80000 other people playing
concurrently are non-entities who play the game solely for their
own personal enjoyment.  Their world of self-indugence comes
crashing down around their heads when the GM arrives and
refuses to grant them their breast-feeding session at whim, and
they immediately throw tantrums (like a 3 month old not getting
enough food) and display for the world their true level of
maturity.

It is these people that waste the vast majority of in-game service
time, thereby monopolizing the GMs away from the other players,
many of whom may really need help.

I've only called on GMs twice in my entire online experience, and both times
my situation was resolved quickly and courteously.
