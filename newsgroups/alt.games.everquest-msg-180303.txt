    Those classes were supposed to have that advantage since the game first
came out. That it didn't work that way is irrelevant. The outdoor nature of
parts of PoP forced SOE to finally fix that bug. I imagine they figured it
would be easier to fix it now than to keep deciding what and what not to
flag "lull immune".

    "Better" is a relative term. You can lull higher level creatures than a
paladin, and your best lull is nearly half the mana cost of the best lull an
enchanter or cleric has. You also get that best lull many, MANY levels
before a cleric or enchanter gets their best lull. And the best test of all,
the synergy test: if you and I were outdoors and grouped, which of the two
of us do you suppose would be expected to go lull a camp to pull? The main
healer, or the light tank with snare?
