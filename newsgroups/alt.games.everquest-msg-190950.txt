The point here is that other people can make the maps you want to use in 
Cartography, then you can DL them. I, for one, do not miss crossreferencing 
my current /loc with the map.

Additionally, you can add layers and labels, IE "This line is the path to 
get to Place X" or "Pull here, then here, then over there"
