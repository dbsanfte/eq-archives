Checked on the Steve Jackson Games website.  It is out of print.  They
recommend a list of dealers in out of print stuff, here is a url
http://www.sjgames.com/general/outofprint.html.  If all else fails, and I
can still find my copy of it, I could possibly be convinced to do something
ilegal.  I may have given it away along with all my other GURPS stuff to a
friend, if so, I can see about borrowing it for purposes of copying it. It
was designed to go with GURPS 3rd edition.
