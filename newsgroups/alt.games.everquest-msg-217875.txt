Nice try, but not good enough. It was an effort to impress on you a
dose of this thing called "real life", in which spending money on
luxury items isn't easy to do.

Computers are NOT amazingly cheap to those who spend nearly all of
their income on NECESSARY costs of living. You're 23, whoopee. Do you
have your own job, your own home, your own family, totally free of
outside help from parents or other relatives?

Computers aren't necessities by a LONG shot. $1k+ may be "amazingly
cheap" for a luxury item for you, but not to most people.

However, that would be shutting out those who bought EQ based on the
ORIGINAL system specs and would be unable to play if they mandatorily
raised those.

When are such shallow people going to get it through their heads that
good graphics are not required to make a good game? If the game is
good, all raising the graphics does is shut out those who can't afford
to keep their systems up to date.
