Well, other than not using correct punctuation, grammar, and spelling, you may 
or may not be violating the EULA.  Certain members of this newsgroup get very 
agitiated at any one of these transgressions, and absolutely apoplectic when 
presented with such a combination.  In addition, you are offering to trade items 
in one game for items in another game, at an enchange rate which appears on the 
surface to be extremely skewed.  This froup is *generally* against Ebay, and 
takes a dim view of anything resembling Ebay, even legitimate cross-server 
trades.
Other than that, the Blacksnow comment is a reference to a group of gamers who 
play to sell items on Ebay, who have had accounts suspended for exploiting, and 
are now threatening to sue the game companies for not letting them exploit and 
sell their game items.  Basically, we're using your slightly annoying post to 
make wry comments about a group of scumbags who truly are ruining their own 
lands.
