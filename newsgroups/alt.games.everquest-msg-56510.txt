I'd say go with the monk.

While they're both great additions to your group, you're a bit melee light.

If you had more of a melee mix, I'd say go with the bard, but since the
druid/chanter/cleric can do everything the bard can do (OK! Not all, but
almost) the added melee damage from the monk is more important.
