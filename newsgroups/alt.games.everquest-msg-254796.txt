I'm gonna assume you are up in the main part of Katta.  Look at the eqatlas 
map for Katta <http://www.eqatlas.com/luclin/kattacastellummap.html>.  
There is an opening  near the buildings marked 3 and 4.  Go out that and 
you'll see a pathway down to the next area, be careful, it's a long fall if 
you fall off the edge.  Get down to the bottom and take the wall to the 
right and find another opening.  Follow that passage for a long way and 
you'll eventually find the way to Twilight Sea.
