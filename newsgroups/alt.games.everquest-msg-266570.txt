My iksar monk always wanted to have a quest of redemption in EQ1 (i
feedbacked it several times a month for years) and I'm really happy that
there's a traitor quest for eq2. However, there's player built housing
(understand this point of view is from someone anxiously waiting on delivery
rather than being able to play yet) and i would hate for my home to sit in
the enemy's camp!

Can anyone tell me what happens to your house if you do the quest? I'm
hoping to do the heritage thing from my monk (ideally i'd have cazic-thule's
head pinned to my wall) and get the j-boots, so if i make a mistake, it's a
bitch to scrap the character and start again. :P

Brett Caton.
