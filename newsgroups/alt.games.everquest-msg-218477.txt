Your priorities are a bit messed up; assuming there are several
mobs which will all be doing damage until killed, which one is
going to do the least damage over the run of the fight?  The one
the tank is currently killing!  Its going to die first, after
all.

Its more important to slow the mob that will be dying Last, than
the one that will be dying first.

Better still to seperate the mobs and root park them or
something, so they do zero damage instead of just 60% or 50% or
40% damage; parking the add is like 100% slowing it till its
engaged.

Someone else in the thread suggested  using Sit aggro to split
out the unengaged adds, and this can be a pretty good plan if you
can take a few hits; but I'd go one better by casting a heal
instead, this is never resisted nor a waste of mana, and gets you
the attention of the adds, but they don't get free max damage
hits on you, in fact depending on range and number they may never
hit you at all, get them rooted out of the way and then come back
and slow the initial target, then the adds in turn.
