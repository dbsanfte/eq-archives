	Yes, thanks, that was it.  

	Another question :-)  I picked "druid" because I heard they
were good solo characters, but it seems like it will take me forever
to level: I can kill dark blue and white by myself, but I only move
the experience bar a smudge and I have to rest up before the next kill.

	Is it just a matter of getting strong enough not to have to wait
or is there some strategy to soloing a druid?

	And why don't the guards in Feydark attack arboreans?  I had
one actually follow me up the lift and kill me in front of 3 guards
and two merchants!
