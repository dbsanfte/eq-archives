While killing Wuoshi is indeed a faction hit, its an extraordinarily tiny one.
Killing Gore isn't a COV faction hit at all, although there is one dragon in WW
thats on Ring of Scale faction.  Killing in CS doesn't give you faction hits for
COV at all unless for some reason you insistantly go after Yvolcarn or
Azureake.. never heard of anyone hunting them... or perhaps that sea dragon
(seen him twice, and I literally leveled 44 to 54 soloing half the time in CS)

You were KOS to dragons because you didn't kill enough giants not to be, and
weren't a Veeshan worshipping bard (only class/religion combo that starts non
KOS)

What on earth would prevent you getting that body?  450pp can buy you coffins
for Three SC, not just one.  Or one non KOS person with a 6pp chipped bone rod
could easily walk to your body and drag it back to you... just sit there at the
WW/SG line and hire some help.  Or click rod, then invis yourself and go get
body, there's almost nothing in the zone that sees invis.

I can't think of the last non recoverable body I've heard of.

A 60 monk isn't much in the way of protection.  Whats he going to do, FD near
you so the mobs will think you are dead too?
