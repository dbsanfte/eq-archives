I would tell your group before hand that you are low on money and that you
are just going to symbol the MT and puller, If any one else wants it let
them donate. you should get enough in loot to cover yourself. Also you can
sit in nexus and cast for donatins. As one who plays on Tarew Marr I can
tell you you should be able to maje some money doing this.
