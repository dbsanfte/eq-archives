I've recenly started playing EQ, just so u get an idea of how recent i
have a 5th warrior, and recently started a magician 1st lvl on the new
server Stromm. so far i've found the game relatively boring as first
off i can't really go anywhere, I've tried sneaking through the
country side to no avail (just to sight see), secondly either im being
ignored or ppl aren't recieving the msgs i type (which sucks, )
thirdly from what i've read this game is geared to group adeventuring
and seeing as even when ppl near me speak ( i can see there names
above the char.) and respond (ie
 "any one want to form a group of lvls 1 -4?" 
ME - "sure" 
person "___" (doesn't respond). Its frustrating, and no one has given
me an answer as to why this is happening, tech support, ppl in the
chatrooms usually ignore me as well, i mean what the hell, this sucks,
am i destined to be a shadow within the game forever?

As to questions as to why i chose everquest over other MMORPGs - well
its big (the biggest as far as i can tell, in terms of actual world
size, and i hoped there would be nice ppl in which to play with (so
far i haven't convinced any RL friends to get the game (or for the one
friend who bought the game - play) im not surprised he gave it up. All
the problems that i've experienced are the reasons why i've NEVER
played games online before (aside from a little bit of diablo 1 with
some RL friends)
