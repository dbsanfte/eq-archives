The problem you're running into is that there
are two reasons why people play clerics. The
first reason is that they want to have a
character that is needed in raid groups, either
because their main's guild needs clerics (most
do) or because they want to join an uber guild.
The second reason is that the player wants to be
helpful.

The first sort of person is habitually /anon.
They typically do not wish to ever be bothered
by anyone as they are in a hurry to hit 50. The
second sort may be /anon, /roleplay or tagged
from time to time depending upon what they are
doing.

The first sort will rez in group, but they will
typically not do rezzes freelance. The second
sort will rez for free time and mana permitting.

How does all this gross over-simplification
relate to your situation? Simply put, the
public's perception of clerics is the second
sort, a selfless poor do-gooder who will rez
anyone for free and throw in buffs and heals to
boot. Your behaviour is conflicting with that
perception.

Everyone expects druids to be selfish plat
grubbing jerks who can't spell or type
(deliberate troll here), but Tunare help the
poor cleric who dares to charge for his down
time.

Just be aware when you start charging, the
public will not be supportive and you will be
undercut from time to time by naive fools such
as myself who would never think to charge for a
rez.

Bottom line: Your time is money, but you will
get no support from anyone on this.
