By what I have seen a Druid's Harmony spell reduces the agro range to nil
and as long as you don't attack they do not atack you. I have used a Druid's
Harmony Spell to take a Human Monk (deity Quellious) from Ready to Attack to
amible by giving Sarnark War Braids (Protect the Shipyards Quest) to Captain
Rottgrime (Skelly Captain in OT) I was attacked many times till the Druid
got the timming down on keeping all the Undead Harmonized but it works. I
now have the Workers Sledgemallet to port to OT. Its a real pain in the butt
and has some hazards but can be done.
