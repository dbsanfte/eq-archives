Misty kinda sucks at times because you either have to go so far out that you
die or the guards KS you.  They have the biggest agro ranges of any guards
I've ever seen.  What you can do, at your level, is go out and then left or
right.  Stay close to the wall but move away from the guards.  You can
usually get single mobs that way.  There are goblins who get fairly close to
the wall if you head right.  To the left, is bats and bears and snakes, oh
my. )
