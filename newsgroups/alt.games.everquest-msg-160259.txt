Hide is funny for classes other than rogues, you dont' get a success message.
What you have to do is target a mob to which you are not indifferent, then try
hiding.  On a success, the mob will con indiff, otherwise it will continue to
con the way it always has.  With a fixed skill of 50, at low levels you'll
probably have all your mana back before making it work!

Sneak requires the same trick, but is harder to check.  It works only when in
the rear arc of the target mob.  Its also pretty much useless for the "don't
attack me while I med" plan, since few wanderers will keep you in their rear
arc the whole time.

What sneak allows you to do is move, hide is broken if you move other than
spinning in place.  With sneak, you can move, albiet slowly, as long as you
don't get out of the rear arc of anything within aggro range.  Its most useful
for using vendors, who are probably not going to attack you but might refuse to
trade with you, or even just give you bad prices for your poor faction.  Get
sneak active behind one, and he's indifferent and will happily deal with you.
The logic for this escapes me, "oh, a disembodied voice wants to buy
something..."

Rogues, and rogues only, who successfully activate both hide and sneak, can
move about in total invisibility, to both live and undead mobs, with only the
exception of specifically "see invisible" mobs to worry about.   They also get
success/fail messages on each activation, which is much less of a pain than the
old "find someone and check" plan.

On MT it seems there's always one or two available, for around 4500pp.  At a
guess, a potter can make one for half this but would spend 10 times this
getting the required skill, or would spend at least twice this getting to
moderately high skill and then trying it repeatedly and mostly failing.  This
is based on no knowledge of high level pottery whatsoever, mind you, its just a
guess based on the usual trends in high level trade skills.

Yep, the utility of this took a major jump up with PoP release.  I used to use
it simply as a way to go hide, or to bank and refresh supplies, I'd offer BB as
a possible pickup spot for porters, but almost always they'd pick somewhere I
could walk to instead.  Now... well I only wish that the Kaladim temple was
closer to Butcherblock, I have to zone twice to get to a pedastle!
