The real advantage of pacify/harmony is being able to split mobs
quickly.  Cast the spell and pull.  You don't have to wait while the
other mobs reset.  The other advantage that you mentioned is also nice,
being able to harmo something and run by it.  (That was nerfed for
rangers after 65, not sure about Cleric, Chanter and others.)  However
I would say that the feigning classes have a wider assortment of mobs
that they can split.  For a couple duoers who may not be too worried
about sometimes waiting an extra 30-60 seconds for a pull, the
advantage of a "feigner" probably outweigh the advantages of a
pacifier.

The shaman can keep the necro SoWed and regenning, which is sooooo nice
for any necro.

Up to 55.

Necro and shaman would be a lot of fun IMO.  Necro pets are reasonable
tanks, especially at the right levels.  All my necro lacked (unless
fighting undead) was a slow spell.  If I had slows and the healing
power of a shaman, I could have taken on a lot higher level mobs for
pet tanking.  There is a lot of diversity here.  Agro kiting, tap
tanking, pet tanking, fear kiting.  You have a reasonable puller, a
snarer, a SoWer, a slower, a healer, a tank, a rabbit, and lots of
utility.
