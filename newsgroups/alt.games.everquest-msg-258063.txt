Would seem odd that it would work two completely different ways for people. 
I'm always the puller, which means I get hit with dispels more than anyone
else I group with generally.  On occasion I've had a mob stop before getting
to the group and dispel me 2 or 3 times in a row (yeah yeah, duck behind a
corner...  it's just a grind, not a 5k nuke =).  After every dispel, I click
my junks back up and watch them get dispelled again.  Not even the slightest
hint of randomness.
