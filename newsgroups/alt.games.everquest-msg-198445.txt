Last time I played successfully was Wednesday.  Tonite (Friday) my
wife and I have each had the same problem with the same symptoms with
our computers.  Whenever we try to sign in with an existing character,
we get hung with a black screen.  We've each been able to create a new
character and get in just fine, but existing chars don't work.  I've
tried deleting the UI and ini file for one of my existing chars, no
luck.  I also tried running dxdiag, which came up fine.

I'm going to run a full scan etc but wondering if anyone else who had
run into this had any specific solutions.
