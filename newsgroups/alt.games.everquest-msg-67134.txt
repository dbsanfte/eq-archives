As you seem to indicate I should have read your e-mail address more
carefully, I recommend you do the same. I'm not in Britain, but
from-nyc.

I apologize for overestimating your sophistication. I had presumed
that someone old enough to be a mom would have some knowledge of
history and recognize the allusion.

In order to answer your question, one would have to start from false
postulates (namely that the warrior epic was ever broken.) The most
classic example of this is Joe McCarthy, when serving on the House
Unamerican Activities Committee, asking one witness, "And, when did
you stop beating your wife?"

I can't begin to tell you how disheartening it is to believe that, in
this current political climate, our collective memory is so short that
we don't remember the *last* witch hunt.
