Your statement   "I can't even unload the mage spectral's I've been
trying to sell for just a few k each (including Black Steel and
Maelstrom of Ro)."

I took this as the Spectral parchaments... as in I have not ever heard
of the spells themselves refered to as Spectral's.   So from my
perspective of what I understood,  neither 1 or 2 applys.

sorry if I misunderstood, was just trying to help out...
