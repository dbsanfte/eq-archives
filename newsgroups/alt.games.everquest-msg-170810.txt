Speak for yourself, my friend.  As far as I can tell Remington is presenting
some reliable statistics that more or less correspond with what I've
discovered myself in doing research on contraceptives.  You refuse to
believe what anyone else says, not because you have any reliable arguments
to the contrary -- I have yet to see you post solid evidence for your point
of view, merely conjectures and anecdotes -- but because, as I said before,
you'd rather see people get pregnant, lose their health, and/or die so that
things like contraceptives, which *you* believe propagate what *you*
consider an immoral practice, will not become general use.  You don't give a
flying fuck about anything or anyone besides your own tunnel vision beliefs.

Even supposing that Remington and I and everyone who's argued against you is
completely and utterly wrong, how in the name of whatever God you believe in
can you argue that since contraceptives won't prevent *all* risk they
shouldn't be made easily accessible to people who need them?  Is it possible
that you would seriously argue that people are safer not using them than
using them?  Or are you one of those people (I've met many like this) who
believe that if you're going to be immoral and have sex, you deserve
whatever happens?

Look, seriously, will you enlighten me as to why you think condoms are wrong
because (as you believe) they prevent a lower percentage of pregnancies
and/or STDs than 97% (or whatever figure)?  Unless you've thought up a
better method of preventing these things, the only point I can see here is
that you simply don't want people to do anything that doesn't follow your
conservative morals.

By the way, when I say "a better method", I don't mean abstinence, whose
major drawback is the fact that nobody will ever convince people not to have
sex -- nor, for that matter, do I believe anyone should be convinced not to
have sex except where there's quite good reason to believe it will do
serious harm to them.  Sex is a good and beautiful thing.  Did you tell your
son that?  Or will he grow up terrified of one of the most natural, healthy,
and pleasurable functions of the human body?  Will you tell him never to
play a sport because he might break a bone?  Or never to drive a car because
he might have a wreck?  Or never to get a job because he might get fired and
go broke?
