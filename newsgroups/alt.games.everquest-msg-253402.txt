It wouldn't be possible.  If someone who does not have PoP was invited to a
raid, the group he was in would be prevented from joining the raid.  And a
fail message would be given for an attempt to invite him to a group already
in a raid.

If you do have Planes of Power installed, do a complete file check in the
patcher, and be sure that all expansions are turned on in the "advanced"
section of the options.  Since it should be working for him.
