I suppose one could call Vanilla Dunk "upbeat" if you think of it only
in comparison the story preceeding it. (Which is about the life of a guy
who has been "ressurected", after dying, by the govt. but still spends
about half of his time in hell.)  But the fact is, it's still a tragedy,
both in terms of the black basketball player who's attempts to compete
with the new upstart player are somewhat thwarted, and a story set in a
time when personal competitive spirit and the ability to achieve are
totally destroyed by the technological advances of the "exo-suit" and
the ability to download the abilities of great past players like Michael
Jordan into new players with far less native talent.
  Well, I found it sad anyway. <g> But then again, it's certainly the
lightest thing I've seen from the author thus far. Having been unable to
find them in the local booksellers, we just ordered online "As She
Climbed Across the Table" and "Girl in Landscape".  Any observations on
those? Haven't found a source for the Brooklyn Bridge one yet. *sigh*

Q: How many surrealists does it take to screw in a light bulb? 
A: Two. One to hold the giraffe and the other to fill the bathtub with
brightly colored machine tools.
