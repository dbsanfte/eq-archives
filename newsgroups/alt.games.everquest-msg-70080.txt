GTA3 is my choice as well... it has simply redefined
one's expectations of a gaming experience.  Not only
does it succeed in being a revolutionary title, it
also pulls it off by enabling any gamer to have a
total blast in the process.  It's sheer exhilirating
fun, and anyone that's given the game a shot has come
away from it with plenty of praise.

Looking back on what has been a predominantly PS2
dominated year, the only other candidates for such a
lofty distinction as 'Game Of The Year' are Metal Gear
Solid 2, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 (PS2), Gran Turismo
3 A-SPEC and Halo (the only non-PS2 game that should
merit any consideration).

Some of those games were revolutionary, some provided
enormous play value and offered a lot of fun and bang
for the buck, but none provide the entire package of
a Grand Theft Auto III for ANY and EVERY kind of gamer
out there.  And that's quite an accomplishment.

Mind you, FFX is still waiting in the wings.  I'm
really looking forward to it but I can't see it
toppling GTA3 off its much-deserved perch.
