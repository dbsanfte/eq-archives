Sounds to me like you need consider why you want to play.  For me, it's a
great few hours of D&D-ish hack and slash with some great friends (new and
old).  I like to group too and soloing for me is just too boring, so I enjoy
the social aspect wether it's at L54 or L14.

If you can't find a reason to play, then give it up for a while and maybe
you'll be back!
