Again, theres way too many ways to interpret what they said to just accept
that it supports your position.

What about my very first account, which I opened in May 99 and deactivated
in September 99.   Since I bought a new account when I returned for the
first time, the highest level on that account is 34, with alts in the 20's.
Is that account being counted in thier totals?   What about all the other
inactive accounts of people who quit midway?
