  Well, when somebody is asking you a favor, you're completely within your
rights to deny that person the favor on whatever basis you choose.  If you
think the way somebody asks for a SoW is lazy, and you don't like laziness,
you're completely within your rights to say "no", or to ask them to say
"please."  While it may be wrong to presume a person is a completely lazy,
rude, or whatever kind of person just because you see them say "plz" once, I
don't like doing favors for people who can't or won't phrase their request
in such a way that strikes me as polite and gracious.
