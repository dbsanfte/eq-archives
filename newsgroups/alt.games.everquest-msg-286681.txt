Or take just now.  I look at the Network Status page, all servers are UP.

OK, its still nearly an hour before the predicted end of patch.  But 
they go over time quite a lot, there's no reason to think they couldn't 
finish under time.  Maybe they're up.

Nowhere do I find any report as to what is happening currently, which is 
very likely simply that they're up and testing.

I try to log on, and do get to the server select page, where, surprise 
surprise, they're all locked.

No report as to whats going on on the forums, or at least, not anywhere 
I can see it.  Maybe its in some thread on the forum somewhere... like 
printing the information on one specific toilet paper sheet on the roll 
in that bathroom stall we're talking about.
