Explain why... it looks like that is the basic model at work here,
monk/shaman.  Yes, one of the central features of the monk
class in actual play, Feign Death, is missing, so the class isn't
going to be doing the monk job.  But as far as actual combat
is concerned, beastlords appear to rely on hand to hand and light
weapons, little armor but improved defenses... isn't that the
monk melee model?

Still looking for the evade/jolt/FD feature that the other non-sponge
tanks have... and hoping it doesn't come as late in the game as Jolt.

My thought, though, is that the feature is the pet. At low levels,
both necros and mages tank, and learn to use their pets to get
out of combat.  Asuming that a beastlord's pet is on a par with
those, rather than a SK/Druid pet, we should be looking at a potent
combination of pet plus melee rather than pet plus nuking... if
only the beastlord can manage to lose the aggro when needed.
