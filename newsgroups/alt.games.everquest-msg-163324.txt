Lets go thru this again.  You were killed after training mobs to the zone line, when
you crossed over that line and hit the remnants of someone elses' train.  Someone
you never saw.  Someone you figure has to have been a bard.

Even though your character, NOT A BARD, just did the same thing!

Anyone faster than a mob and outclassed by that mob, particularly by a pack of them,
can end up training them to zone.  And given that SOW is castable on others,
drinkable from a potion, and replacable by Run AA or TBoots or JBoots, pretty much
anyone can be faster than mobs.  Bards do NOT have a monopoly on this.

Third, the Kromiff Tracking Wolves are not normally in Iceclad, they are spawned by
triggering the 8th shawl quest.  Given the difficulty of getting to this final stage
of a very long quest, its very unlikely that any single person was trying it, bard
or no.  For those mobs to be wandering around lose, more than one person is to
blame.  Further, the 8th shawl is not terribly useful for a bard, compared to any
caster/healer/hybrid... odds are actually strong that the person ultimately
responsible for their presence wasn't a bard at all.

As long as you understand that this is called prejuice and bigotry, it can be fun to
roleplay... I've always thought it must have been great fun to play Archie Bunker...
