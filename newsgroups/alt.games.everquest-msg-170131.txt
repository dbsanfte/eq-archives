 Easiest thing to do is go in a fight a few. Keys are soul-bound so CR
is pretty easy. I haven't been there in awhile but the respawn on
regular mobs used to be 2 hours. I think. We were normally in and out in
under 2 hours so that wasn't a problem.

 Pulls are straightforward although I haven't pulled since the revamp so
I don't know if the drakes are casters or not. Everything used to be
melee except for the gargoyles in the library. Oh and also the wandering
debris golem. There were also fewer of them. Now ST is pretty packed
with critters so if you fight your way down it will take awhile.

 As for the warders (ancients now) I'll leave that to you. Mainly
because I don't remember who did what other than they have some nasty
AE. PoP-era spells, such as mgb elixer and group CHs more than likely
make them trivial encounters.
