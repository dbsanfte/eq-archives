Is it a lockup or a disconnect?

I've had the annoying problem recently of getting the disconnection screen
suddenly (that is, no slow rise of packet loss on the meter prior to the
disconnect) and not being able to maintain a connection in certain zones.
I'd go linkdead, reconnect, load the same character, and immediately go
linkdead again upon logging in.  It seems to be related to the particular
zone, as I could log in different characters right after the linkdeath and
not have a problem at all maintaining a connection.

Perhaps this problem has hit PoK as well.
