Are you serious? That sure isn't my perspective but I don't have any hard
numbers, this is all just based on personal observations and totally
anecdotal experience. EverQuest is legendary for its enforcement of grouping
and "toleration" of soloing. And while I do see people solo all the time and
hear plenty accounts of people soloing, overall I still think my numbers are
probably close on EQ.

Soloability in this game (as in all MMOGs) depends to some extent on which
archetype you play, but the game was supposedly designed to allow all
archetypes soloability. As a practical matter, I think it's hard for some of
the higher level Controllers or Defenders to solo, but probably fairly easy
for Blasters, Tankers and Scrappers. Illusion Controllers are an exception
because of the damage that they do and the pets they get, they're ideal for
soloing.
