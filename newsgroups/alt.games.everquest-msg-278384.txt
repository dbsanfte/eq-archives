That's what the DMCA proponents, and others for whom that is a beneficial
stance, would very much like everyone to believe.  It's wrong, but I'm sure
they'd be happy to know they pulled the wool over yet another sucker.  =)

Point of fact, the only reverse engineering that is made illegal by the DMCA
is that which is intended to circumvent piracy prevention methods.  I.E.,
DVD ripping effected by debugging and observing how a legal video player
gets past the piracy protection.  Though you were correct that much of even
that limited scope of the DMCA has yet to be tested in court.

The only way the DMCA would be relevant to this discussion in the slightest
is if it involved a method designed to circumvent the CD key system Sony has
in place for obtaining an Everquest account.
