That sounds fairly standard. Most newbie zones are pretty empty these days.
Most servers also have a lot of established high end guilds who's members
will be away raiding planes or in the newer Discord and Omens zones. It also
depends on what time you play, server and country. Given that EQ2 is also
due out soon the situation will probably get significantly worse. Also
because there are so many Zones now even a densely populated server can this
out significantly.

Basically EQ has grown up and grown old so that the average character level
on most established servers is probably 55 -60.  Your best bet given the
level of your characters is to start on one of the preferred servers.
However there is an advantage having 'empty' newbie zones especially if you
are a class that can solo reasonably well in that you can level fairly
quickly especially by getting some buffs in the Plane of Knowledge. Use of
the looking for group window can help as well.
