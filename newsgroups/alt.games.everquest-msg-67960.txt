The new zones are *really* super nice graphically IMO and there is content for
all levels, so I would think you could easily level a kitty to 30 and beyond
solely on Luclin. That said, there are, shall we say, technical problems with
the new expansion? The new zones are extremely laggy for me (and apparently a
number of other people to judge from the /ooc and /guild comments.)  I had to
log off today because the jittery framerate/lag combination was making me car
sick. =P I am running 512mb ram, geforce2 64mb graphics card, and a celeron 500
processor. I suppose the problem might be that my processor is under powered;
but I don't know for sure. Anyway, I'd say it's worth buying if/when Verant gets
the bugs worked out and if you have hardware that can handle the huge demands
SoL puts on it.
