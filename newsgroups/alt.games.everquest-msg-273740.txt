It's true, most of these games don't need the level of customization that's 
offered by EQ2, for example, where the breadth of jaw or length of chin will 
never be noticed lol. I think your suggestion of more faces and hair styles 
(things you could actually notice) provide a happy medium somewhere between 
EQ2 and WoW.
