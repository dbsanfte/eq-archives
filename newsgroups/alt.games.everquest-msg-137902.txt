That's cruical to the strategy my druid partner and I use for getting rare 
nameds to pop.  We were camping the corrupted gorilla in EJ, and I went 
AFK for a minute, and then she snared herself when she went out to pull, 
and sure enough, he finally popped.  We've tried it a couple times since 
and had fair luck with it... It seemed very effective at the RVS camp in 
tenebrous.  It works slightly better if I don't -tell- her I'm going AFK, 
of course.
