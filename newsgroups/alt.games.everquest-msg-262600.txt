So, by attacking Iraq on the fictional basis that they were going 
nuclear (we knew that the aluminum tubes were not for seperating nuclear 
materials, but said they were, we knew the yellow cake thing was false 
but said it wasn't), what did we achieve?

By not attacking North Korea or working to stop them from going nuclear, 
we've put them in a position where we -can't- do anything.

Now imagine you are a "rogue nation".  What do you do?  Get rid of your 
weapons programs and invite inspectors in?  Or crash that program thru 
as fast as you can, knowing once you make it you'll be inviolable?

Does it help your answer to know that the US forces which might have 
threatened you are mostly tied up in an attempt to control a guerilla 
warfare situation?

Keep in mind the difficulty you mentioned earlier; proving a negative. 
How do you prove you have no weapons program?  Iraq was unable to prove 
that, especially in the face of people willing to believe what they want 
to believe and disregard any analysis which might have indicated the 
whole thing was a chimera.
