When they cast the spell, you will see a confirmation box, it will say
what percentage of xp this spell will give back. They gave clerics
more resurrects which give xp back some time ago, but the lowest one
still doesn't give any xp at all. 

The box will say something like "blah wants to cast revicence on you, 
this will return 99 percent experience "  Yes/no?
