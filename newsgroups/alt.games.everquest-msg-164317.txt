Focus III gear is very expensive though, in comparison to 1 and 2.  And the
antique ring quest is free!  Although I've kept my +6 wisdom rings for when
Focus II dies off,  I have been wondering if it would be beneficial to
downgrade my spells in order to use the focus affects.  I can't see doing it
with a heal, obviously, but root / snare / fear?  I thought those kinds of
spells got "better" at higher levels....?
