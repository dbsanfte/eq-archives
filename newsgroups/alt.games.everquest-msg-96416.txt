If it's "just a darn game" you wouldn't have posted this paragraph.

Why are you assisting the 2nd tank?  Why aren't you assisting the MAIN tank?
My guess would be that your main/second tank went & switched targets without
announcing, which is very stupid.

Sounds to me also like you and your friends have done your damnedest to
avoid grouping with crowd control folks before today.

Bottom line is...enchanters are a known item and often HIGHLY desired.  NO
ONE highly desires beastlords so I'd recommend a change of 'tude if you want
to group in the future.

I'm not saying you should do everything the enchanter says, but I have a
feeling your 'tude showed last night and instead of figuring out why 2
critters really WERE up you got defensive right away.  If you DOTed anything
you're probably at fault anyway.
