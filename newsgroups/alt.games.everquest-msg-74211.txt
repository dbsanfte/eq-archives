I just find it funny that your talking about things being too lethal, when
another poster in another thread talked about how things were too slow in EQ
fight and needed to be more sudden, ROFL.  dragging to much.  That is
probably my biggest prob with DAOC.  combat is too fast, making things a
rush fest.  Because you can recover so fast, things seem more hectic.  I
remember listening to someone else with the same complaint about how things
are so fast the healers don't get to look at the screen, only the health
bar, to cast heals. I like a more strategic type of fight that EQ does
nicely, where things move along at a decent pace ( at least in single
groups).  I guess in huge fights in like TOV things would definitely be more
sudden, as getting hit for 1 K of damage each swing means you need that heal
NOW.   : )

Remember a movie someone made in MPG format that was hilarious, with some
heavy metal background, where this particular guild got wasted by 4 dragons.
appearantly they figured out some way to copy screen data over and over and
then bring it to movie type format.

Anyhows.....
