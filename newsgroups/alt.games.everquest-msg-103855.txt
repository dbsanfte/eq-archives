Start a second account, start an enchanter level him up so
he can cast Clarity then drag him around with you everywhere
to cast it on you.

Other alternative is to get items with the "Flowing Thought" effect
on them. These items generally drop only from level 55+ creatures
that need a raid size group of people to get to. Of course everyone
wants the items and you will have to roll for them.

Good Luck, hope you have a guild.
