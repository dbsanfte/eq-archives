My reading comprehension is just fine, I was posting as a followup to the
thread, which included, but was not limited to, your post.  As you may have
noticed, I did address the Trilogy box specifically later in the post.  No
need to get all worked up about it.

There is this nifty feature in Windows, it's called cut and paste.  I did
very little typing in my post.  In fact, I did much more typing in this
post.

You have your theory, personally, I have not bought the Trilogy box, so what
it says on there is not relevant to me.  I bought Kunark, then I bought
Velious.  At the time I was running Win95, which is supported.  I have never
even looked at the boxes to see if Win2k is supported, they claim on their
website it is, so, I will continue to labor under that impression.
