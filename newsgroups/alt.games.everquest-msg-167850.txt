for exp the planes become valuable at 50+ vlv's but even for lower lvl's pop
is already quite qworthwhile. Best feature is ofcourse the hub POK provides.
No need to wait for a port no endless distances of running etc. etc. for the
rest the spells they provide for some classes some of them just a bone for
the dog others are more valuable. Quests and the fact that almost every
vendor puchasable item is sold over there. So if you are in tradeskills it
could save you quite some time. And even if it is not like my jeweler needs
velium ok take the port thurgadin (gd) actually get it and be back in jif.
My human sk is still bound in freeport but is hunting in blackburrow. On
death nthing is as easy as running to the portal going up go to the enxt
portaal going don and i'm in nrth qeynos. Just a little bit more to go. A
lot of high lvl figures are hanging out on the planes now full time like
they used to hang in nexus you could find a buff there you can't find in
nex. And when hitting 60 with your cleric, i'm sure you want to hit 61 and
further as well so in the end you'll buy it anyway.
 So is it worth buying it now? You decide yourself but there are quite some
advantages to having it already.
