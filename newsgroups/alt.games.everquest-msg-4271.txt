I see your intelligence and raise you one Dan. Maybe someday we will
laugh together. The thing about intelligence is: Someone that is highly
intelligent, lets say genius level, has the ability to only let you see
what he wants you to. Combined with insight so powerful that he could
see into the future and precisely predict outcomes, and specific
intuition, this person would be impenetrable. If this person was to
exist, and he so choose to initiate some event most would likely not
understand what was happening around them. A person like this would be
likely to toy with people knowing that it does affect them and they
carry it to their real life.
Be careful who you judge. Most people don't know that Einstein was a
very poor speller. Just saying.
Now if this was a conversation about gravitational lensing we would have
more to talk about.
