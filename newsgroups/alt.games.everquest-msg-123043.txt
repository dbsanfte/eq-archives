thanks, but i'll swing idiot where i want. he slung it at me first.
deal with it.

fyi, while most spawns in eq do indeed pop on a set timer; not all
spawns in eq work the way you describe. ragefire is a *random* spawn
according to verant, which concurs with our observations. he does not
have a set respawn time; instead it is x hrs. plus/minus 12 hrs.
timing the spawn should theoretically not give exact information on
when he will pop, otherwise we'd have had a raid force zoning in  that
is the point. sheesh.
