It certainly is money stolen from me :p The only diffrence is it is done
once removed so that the thieves do not have to get there grubby hands
dirty. It is also perfectly legal this theft even if it is completely
immoral.

The sad fact is that many people and companies flee from the tyranny every
day. It is so noticeable these days that democrats are trying to make laws
to stop people from packing up and moving away especially with anything they
have earned. We are still a proud and powerfull country , but that which set
us apart and let us in 200 years far surpass the rest of the world is lost.

Dictators and the socialist views of many are the common state of man. They
always lead to the same society. A capitalist society is a very rare and
wonderfull thing, it has been tried so few times you can count them on the
fingers of one hand. It also always leads to the same society, and that
society is so much better than any other to be staggering, and it never
lasts. It comes to the time where the majority of the people in that
capitalist society no longer care and thus sink into socialism or
dictatorship. All roads no longer lead to rome and soon we will also be just
a shadow of what we once where.
