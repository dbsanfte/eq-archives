Why, exactly?

I mean, anything would be better than nothing, and since they currently 
have it set to nothing, I guess they, too, feel that No Drop items 
should be worth less (well, in their case, worthless) in tribute terms.

But I'm not clear why they think that, or why you do.

Is it because the reason for tribute is to remove items from the game, 
and No Drop items are already removing themselves from the game by 
becoming worthless?

Or is it because you feel No Drop items are easier to get?  It doesn't 
seem to me that they are, they generally strike me as harder to get than 
equivalent droppable items, only at the high end you get to the point 
where there -are- no equivalent droppables.

Or does it have to do with RP reasoning, that the No Drop items aren't 
useful to the people you are giving them to, sort of like me trying to 
hand in Mac components to a school drive where all the computers are IBM 
machines?
