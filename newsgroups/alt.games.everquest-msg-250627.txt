I would suggest.

12 to 17.. Just get temp and head to the back side of PC.  You can
pull the little ground crawlers there.  Should be able to do a few
levels pretty fast.

If you know anyone thats a druid of greater then 34.  Then just get
him to come with you. Its real simple for a DS to be cast on the
toon.. let it get battered .. and just make sure you do a single point
of damage on the mob.

Note if you are on a server where PC is packed.. Try Nejina.  Other
then mage killing greens for their epic.. its empty

Then just go to B1 or B2 and fight you way to 25.  It will be quicker
them mem bluring and all the rest.  Most often a 5 hour sit in B1 will
get you from 17 to 24/25.

Then its a bit of a dabate..

Really best route is hit OT and kill kill kill. You will get lots of
groups with a 50 Chanter along for the ride.  That should see you to
where you can group with your own toon.
