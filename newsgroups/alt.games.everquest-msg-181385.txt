To add a little weight to this...

Last night some guildies (chanter (60), rogue (61), ranger (58),
cleric (55) [myself]) took a small group into the PoJ jail for an hour
or so. Cleared it twice from end to end, with the ranger tanking, and my
mana staying fairly constant. That pretty much matches a previous
experience I had with exactly the same group, substituting a shadowknight
for the ranger.

Excellent aggro control - the ranger rarely lost aggro - and healing
required was comparable to that needed for the SK.

I now regard the common wisdom that rangers can't tank as mythical. (*)

I'll admit that I had KEI from the chanter. :-)

        ...Ronny

(*) I'll admit that I previously had a low opinion of ranger tanking
ability, due partly to an experience in my high 40s where keeping a
ranger alive through a single fight drained my mana pool. But that was
a very nasty MOB, a not-particularly-high-level ranger, and I was mostly
using fairly inefficient heals.
