Hello everyone:

A really straightforward question: I've started my Wizard Epic at level 57,
and have done as much as I can do on my own. I have three mobs to kill for
their loot, the Broken Golem, Phinny and Venril. My guild is organizing a
raid on one of these mobs for me, I think we're doing Phinny first. My
question is, does it make any difference which order we kill my three mobs?
I don't want my guild to go to a lot of trouble arranging a raid for me only
to find that (example) I have part two of the quest and it's no use to me as
I didn't do part one first. I do have a printout of the entire Epic quest,
but it doesn't tell me if the order I kill the mobs matter.

As always thank you for your time .. safe hunting ...

Stevie.
