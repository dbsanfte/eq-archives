I had the same question, and I went with the troll, I used a little point to
get str and sta to 120 and then 105 in agi and left dex on 80. The reason is
that high agi = low damage, it is much nice not to be torn appart each time
you fight. So I have less HP, but when mobs can't hit you hard, it doesn't
really matter.
