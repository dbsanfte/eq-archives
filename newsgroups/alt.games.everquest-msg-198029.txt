Totally OT but;

Jet Li? Pah!
Overrated perfomance gymnast who still can't portray a convincing screen
fighter.

Back to EQ
Wonder how many people will be able to keep all the bell's and whistles on
with EQ2 and is there anything out there today that can run it smoothly? I
don't mean showing off 1 fight with 2 characters, I mean showing a group
fighting or multiple groups even.
Atm they need to show a flashy product to gain interest...I just hope they
have got something worthy of the title "EQ2" when it comes to game play.

CF
/em wonders if "convincing screen fighter" is an Oxymoron
