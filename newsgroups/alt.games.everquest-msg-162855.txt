OK, I'll give you a poor charisma and say its 50pp per fail.  And I'll give you 20
fails per skill up.  Thats 5000pp per skill point.  100 skill points from 150 to 250,
makes it 100,000pp to get to GM... but this assumes no successes at all.  Since I
have an estimated 1 success in 20 at the low end (150 skill) we are looking at 1000pp
plus the what, 300 for the gem thing, 1300pp cost, if you can sell solstice robes for
that much you break even, yes you spent 100,000pp but you got it all back.

Robes regularly sell for 2500pp or more on MT even now.  So you are actually looking
at roughly a 100,000 profit, and thats assuming the success rate never gets any
better!

Further, the only thing you have to kill are Spiders, nothing rare or difficult to
take down  (and no rare drop stuff to worry about either).  Spend a day in EK and you
can make several robes and several skill points even at these miserable success
rates, and I'm told that successes come more often, and skilll ups more often, as you
level up closer to the trivial point!
