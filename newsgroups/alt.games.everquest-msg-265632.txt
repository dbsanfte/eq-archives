In my experience Everquest ran much better than expected on a dialup.   But
there was another area where you notice it.  I found that raiding was not
really possible.   When you were jamming 30 - 50 people in a small area,
even the tiny amount of data generated by each person would add up.  Even
using all serverfilter options, etc, my connection would be so backed up
that I would still see the mob standing and fighting while the chat window
told me they were doing loot.   Flipping off auto attack would take 15 - 20
seconds to process the command and actually stop attacking.

I've played on cable, but I didn't find it to be any better than the DSL I'm
using now.  (Even when it was working.  Dropped it due to major problems
casued by my local cable company)
