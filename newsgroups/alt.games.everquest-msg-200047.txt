I was pulling sonic wolves (i'm a 55 druid and have a 25 chanter friend) in
hollowshade moor, a zone i usually avoid because of the lag and aggressive
green mobs. Anyway, something kept summoning me to the centre of a mob of
wolves, and each time i was summoned, my spell would be aborted without a
channeling check, so i couldn't gate away, and the mobs were generating a
lot of interrupts anyway.

After I died I looked over the log and found out that the mob that summoned
me was yellow to a level 25? A sonic defender is not a named mob... I had no
reasonable expectation that it would be able to summon me and I'm unable to
think of any tactic I could have used to survive the encounter. I tried
running behind a rock to break line of sight but that really only seems to
stop player spells. In future, I've decided to avoid the zone completely ...
which everyone else was doing already. We were the only 2 people in the
zone.

Is there way a 55 druid could have survived? I thought only level 50 + or
named mobs could summon? I do understand that when luclin was released, it
was designed as a druid killer, but this seems ridiculous.
