Halloo,

When can a crippling blow happen?  As far as I know, I have only had 2 with 
my warrior - 1 earlier in his life, and one at level 24.  The one at level 
24 happened when I was alone in LOIO and I pulled a Sarnak.  I didn't 
realize it was Yellow until it was too late.  I knew my friend was logging 
in his Shaman any second, so I decided to try to solo it until he got 
logged on.  I started at half life ( had just bandaged ) and got down to 
about half a bub of life and hit my 2nd all-time crippling blow, which gave 
me the opportunity to win the fight.

This got me wondering if there are prerequisites for it, such as being 
berserk, having a certain DEX / STR or the like.

Anyone know?
