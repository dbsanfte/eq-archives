Well, im glad things worked out for you.
Maybe when you get offered yor next job, you'll do the first month works
free, because you respect the work other employees had done prior to you
showing up? Or maybe out of respect for the boss investing so much time and
money setting up the business?
Or maybe theres some subtle difference im failing to pick up here.
