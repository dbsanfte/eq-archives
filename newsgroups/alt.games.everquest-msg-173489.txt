I apologize for the spam, Jekke, but you might notice that my OP has "OT" in
the subject line... meaning that if you don't want to read off-topic
material then DON'T.  I know fooboy's post wasn't intended to become a
discussion on the war in Iraq but it did through no fault of mine, so this
thread was a reaction to that.  Sorry if I bugged you though.
