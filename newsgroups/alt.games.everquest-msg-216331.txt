Start over and put it in to STA or STR or bouth, int is so easy to get up so
dont worry about it it will come when you get better gear, as it is now I
got about 450 wis on my cleirc but I can only use 355 of them and my STA i
maxed too, wich it is for most of the wizards in my guild too, but then we
are in the hige end part of the game (some say the best guild on the server
some say the second best guild, personly I dont give a BIIP I play to have
fun).
