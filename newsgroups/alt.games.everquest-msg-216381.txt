DONT DO ANY OF THIS

wtf?!

don't ever say you're an ebayer......

anyway

all you really have to do, which might seem silly, is pickup where you left
off - literally

you were 40? go to a lvl 40 zone and mess around on all the greenie mobs
until you figure out what your'e doing

then practice on lvl 50 mobs

when you are all set, after a few hours or so, go to a tier 1 zone (or tier
2 if you're plucky) and kill some bluecon mobs...should be great exp

and when you are comfortable, start LFG'ing and just "play the field" so to
speak

no guild is ever looking for necros =P

but every good guild is looking for players that have a good attitude and
good skills =)

good luck!
