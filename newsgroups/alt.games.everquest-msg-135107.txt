Its a *missed* point !!  (i.e. diversionary tactic, concious effort etc)
If its truely a private, bedroom matter as you are spinning it here, (as it
should be), then there IS no issue.  It *only* becomes an issue when YOU
take it OUT of a private bedroom, and INto the public eye, workplace etc.
If you are wanting what you want to do in private to be "accepted" as
some social norm, it just ain't gonna happen! - that is what "private"
is all about!  If Joe is a sleezy saleperson pushing the legal envelope
to make a living, thats is "private" to Joe. If how/what he does becomes
"public", then he is surely going to come under scrutiny, thats life.
If all "private" matters in society have to become "public", *AND* be
socially accepted, well, God have mercy on us all! - as we are soon to expire.
