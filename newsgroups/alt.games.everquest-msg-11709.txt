Similar thing happened to me.  I put my 2hander in the trade window so
another player could check the stats.  When I cancelled, there was no
room in my inventory and it dropped.  (There is a message about it
dropping by the way, in unobtrusive blue.  Should be alternately
flashing from red to yellow and in all caps at twice the font size of
normal text but that's another matter.)  There were several people
around & I didn't pick it up in time.  Fortunately the other player
did & returned it once I moved my light into a bag to open a spot.
