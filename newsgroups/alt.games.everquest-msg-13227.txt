The trouble I see with this is that players that are obviously "traders" in
EC (the major trading zone for most servers) I do will not buy off. Their
prices are to high. Most work on the concept of buy low sell high (I do
something similar but reduce my profit margins for a quicker sale)
If a guild were to be made up of these characters, they'd buy up all the
stock and force the price up higher. Could you imagine that "uber" farming
guild on your server then sending, say 5 characters with plenty of plat to
EC, buy up all the items sold cheap and sell them higher, eventually the
casual buyer will have trouble buying anything for under "list" price, Gebs
back up to 10k, FBSS back to 12k TBB's back to 6k...Nope I don't want to see
that at all. As new expansions come out and new items drop then last "years"
uber drop is no longer that uber and the price falls, this means that mere
mortals can afford them, the big traders don't like this, they may have said
item in stock and still want the old price for it. I've heard people bitch
at others for selling Noctivagent blades for 15k and not 20 or Iksar BP's
for 10k and not 15k

Hint, if someone puts an item up for auction and declares it an amazing deal
(with or without the price) it prolly isn't one. Genuine cheap items will be
priced (to sell faster) and won't stay up for long.
