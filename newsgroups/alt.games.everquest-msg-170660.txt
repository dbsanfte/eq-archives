That is why I consider welfare a form of slavery.  It is rigged that once
in, you can't escape.  It was formed by the party that opposed equal rights
for all as I recall.
Welfare kills the human spirit.  That is the worst crime one human can
perform on another.  Anything that renders a person unable to survive
without a govt. handout and control.....   I sometimes am ashamed of humans
for the way we treat one another.   Losing a contest is part of life.  If
you are smart, you learn and don't lose that way again.  The welfare
entitlement system combined with PC, takes the challenge out, makes life a
padded white room, no edges.  Safe, soft, nothing to upset.
Yes, I am upsetting myself thinking of this.  It is wrong...period.
Anything that takes from the human spirit is wrong.
