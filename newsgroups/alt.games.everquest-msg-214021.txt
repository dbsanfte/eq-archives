Nope.  Max duration is 3.9 minutes at L65.  Assuming a linear
progression, the duration increases 6 times every 10 levels, at
L16 it would last 1.0 minutes.  This is at least close to correct,
in my late teens it lasted noticeable longer than Grasping Roots
(lasts 0.8 minutes), but was definitely not as long lasting as
2 castings of Grasping Roots.  At L51 it lasts long enough to
kill a Hill Giant (ca. 3 minutes) but I have to use Ensnare (or
be prepared to recast Snare) to kill something tough.
