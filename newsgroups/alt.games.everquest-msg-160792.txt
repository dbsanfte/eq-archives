While I am still addmittedly a newbie to EQ, I would think that some sort of
variation on the Holy Trinity ( Warr. Cleric, enchanter ) + a utility class
would be a great group. For the utility class I would think that Shaman, or
Druid would be high up on the list with the next tier being either Wizzy,
Ranger or Paladin.
