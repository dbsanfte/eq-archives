}Handing in sarnak braids to captain rotgrim inside the outpost. Youll need

Wolf form and boon will both get you killed.  The masks are all bard/rogue, 
I'm pretty sure.  Possibilities left:

Having Rottgrime charmed for you (I suspect this would be rather difficult 
with all the mobs in the area)

Ball of Golem Clay from Old Cazic had one charge of illusion: earth elemental
(Not sure if it still drops)

Amulet of Necropotence (off CT in Fear) has illusion: skeleton

Philosopher's Stone off a rare named faerie drake in LFay has 5 charges of 
illusion: tree (not sure if it still drops)

That's pretty much it.  I don't know, for your race/class/religion, if the 
illusions will raise you enough to do a handin.  I suspect that outpost 
faction really isn't worth -that- much effort.
