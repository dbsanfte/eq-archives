That argument has been made before. It trivially countered. If you want 
to argue that then:

IGE doesn't *sell* plat, they simply sell the service of transfering 
plat from their account to yours.

> You can't sell something you don't own.

Since I'm just transferring it I don't need to own it. (Just as I don't 
need to own the IP on a CD to sell it to you.)

Furthermore and going off on a tangent, if I buy a song on iTunes I -
should- be allowed to turn around, decide I don't want it anymore, and 
sell it to someone who does. Ironically DRM as its implemented prevents 
this... and this, in my opinion, is an abuse of the consumer by the 
music industry.

But they are hell bent on getting to a model, where we don't buy CD's at 
all, where we don't buy songs, but to where we pay per -listen-, in a 
world of devices that won't record (or if they do record, are hooked 
back to industry HQ with your credit card number to make sure it pays 
them everytime you play it back. That's where the music industry would 
like to go, and they are using technology and tremendous lobbying and 
polital contributions budgets to get there.

The sad part is, the IP legislation already essentially says they have 
the right to control distribution etc. So if they don't want to sell you 
a CD, but would rather instead make you pay a buck everytime you listen 
to a song, they are free to do that. 

In theory you are free within 'fair use' to make a copy of something you 
listen to... but between the push to DRM and the abhorrant DMCA it isn't 
actually possible. To make a 'fair use' copy of a DRM protected title 
entails violating the DMCA.

So a law abiding person can't actually make a fair use copy.

Its demented. The whole DMCA is demented.

This would really only apply if IGE were renting out userids and 
passwords by the hour or something.

Further, the ban on subleases is not inherent, its contractually 
specified. To my knowledge at least, its not a legislated right that the 
lessor automatically has. If I lease a car I can hand it over to my wife 
or kids to drive, unless my lease agreement specficially says otherwise.

And for what its worth, even *that* is not as cut and dry as you make 
out. EQ's EULA (a contract of sorts) for example prohibits its use by 
more than one person. This means SOE explicitly forbids a father from 
playing a character using an account he bought for his 6 year old son. 

At any rate, its not related to copyright, nor IP. Its simply terms of a 
contract, and provided an agreed upon contract doesn't infringe on any 
legally gauranteed rights it will likely hold. SOE's EULA preventing Dad 
from logging into his 6 year olds EQ account likely wouldn't be 
enforceable.
