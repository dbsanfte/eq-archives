IIRC they only did this to chanter nukes because of complaints about it, as
all chanter nukes have the stun component, as opposed to other classes being
able to use a non-stun nuke.  This is also why on stun/nukes the stun
component can be resisted separately (as with most giant/dragon types;
immune to stun/mez).
