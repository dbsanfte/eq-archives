.....ok so I got carried away, but what is the deal anyway?  I used to hear
a few shouts here and there, but now everywhere I go all I hear is "Can I
get a KEI?"  "Looking for KEI"  "Donating for KEI" "Anyone giving out KEI"
etc....

Was this spell recently changed to work on lower levels or something?
