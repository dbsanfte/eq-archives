There are scads of 3d world generators out there that can be used with C++,
and even Delphi and Visual Basic.

The logic engine will be tricky, but a simple parser for your
item/spell/player/effects/mob database should be enough to get you started.

If you want to do a zone based game, then each zone will have a series of
tables and triggerable events based on players/mobs/location/effects.

So let's say you wanted to make 1 zone.  I would recommend:

Visual Studio 6.0 (fun toys - but GnuC is better and faster)
Truespace 3D
3dGen
My SQL
AcidPro (You do want sound effects..right?)
Direct X 8.1 SDK
SonicForge/CakeWalk (don't rip other peoples music..compose your own)

These tools, along with the many 3D graphics LIBS on the net will get you
started.  Hell, in maybe 200 hours, you might recreate West Karana.

Seriously, with the above, you could create a single-player EQ, and add some
network code, and you could create a multi-player LAN/WAN environment.

My point is that a game like EQ = WORK even with the simpler tools listed
above.
