The post I responded to asserted, as you can plainly see above, that
all other damage tables were less than warriors.  I do not consider
it to be picking nits to point out that the statement is false.  Nor
did I in any way imply that warriors were not in the top tier of
melee damage dealers.  As my primary is a paladin I am keenly aware
of the difference between being in the top tier (pretty much any melee
except Bard up to around level 40) and being an also-ran in the melee
damage dealing department.
