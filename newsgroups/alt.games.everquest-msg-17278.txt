Hey All,

    I'm a 31st level Dwarven cleric who has been playing in the half screen
mode for as long as I have the game.  Recently I upgraded to Velious so now I
want to play with the full screen mode.  It does Admittedly look a LOT nicer,
and the extra macro buttons are great. However, the trouble I'm having is, it's
very hard to read text because the colors just blend with the background.  This
is especially a problem with shades of dark blue, such as spell casts and
things of that nature. 
     My other problem is, if I right click on something in Inventory it just
overlays ontop of the other items IN the inventory, instead of overlaying of
the chatroom like it does in halfscreen mode. This makes it IMPOSSIBLE to read
because it's doing more of a blend than an overlay.  
     I play in 800X600 or more and if I switch to halfscreen with "Screen Same
Size" set to on it takes a good 2 seconds for the video card to switch modes,
this is rather dangerous. And if I set it the other way everything is to small
to read. 
    Any Suggestions?  I really do want to use this mode, because I find it MUCH
easier to keep track of targets if I switch to the 3rd person view and rotate
aroiund the group to see whose being hit by what and where the adds are coming
from, etc.

Thanks,
