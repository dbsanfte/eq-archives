I've had pullers run off on 50% HP in the Planes. When I have to CHeal
at 60% if the MOB is unslowed... this is bad.

There are two reasons why having the puller run off when low on HP is
unpopular with clerics.
(1) The puller may die, which is typically a bad thing.
(2) I have to heal the puller early, and the MOB may aggro me.

Most pullers seem to care about (1) but many ignore (2).

Of course, ideally I try to time my final CHeal for a fight to hit the
puller just before they run off to pull, usually as close as possible
to the moment that the MOB drops. Not always possible though, since I
may have other priorities at the time.
