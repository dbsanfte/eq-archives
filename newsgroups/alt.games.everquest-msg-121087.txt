I'm a bad person for doing Dennis' work for him and finding
lots of evidence that supports my conclusion and pointing him
to it?

The fact that I could come up with a dozen examples of the
intelligence of dogs that are widely recognized and accepted
and the best you can come up with is "ya, but I saw my cat do
smart things, and my dog do dumb things!" makes me a
hypocrite?!

Sorry, but why should I believe you any more than I believe
people who think they've been abducted by aliens?!

Show me some REAL evidence!  If you REALLY want me to, I'll
point you to seeing eye dog sites, and K-9 (law enforcement)
sites, and lots of other interesting places.  But PLEASE,
don't make me do such drudgery you can do yourself!
