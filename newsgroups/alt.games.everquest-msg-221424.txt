I've recently come into some really good items through bazaar buying
and selling, and from my main, a Ranger, getting some good gems
lately.

Anyway, I've managed to pick up a Fungus-Encrusted Scale Tunic (the
most expensive thing I've EVER bought, saved for it a long time!),
which struck me as ideal for a Warrior, or possibly a Monk.  I know
Warriors have terrible downtime at later levels due to healing, so I'm
leaning towards using the Tunic for a new Warrior character.  I'm
usually not online for more than an hour or two (although I can at
least leave a bazaar trader online overnight), so that's why the
largely-solo comment.

I do enjoy roleplaying "good" characters, so right now I'm not sure
whether a Barbarian or Dwarf makes the better choice, and if so, which
weapons would serve the character best in getting decent skillups
(right now I have a friend who has an old, banked suit of Crafted she
is willing to sell me, should I go the warrior route) -- since
Warriors can use all weapons, and I've never had much luck in keeping
many of them topped out even on my Ranger.

Warriors just seem like a great, honest class that can just wade into
a fight, even more so than my Ranger -- and I think that's something
I'd like to try.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks so much.
