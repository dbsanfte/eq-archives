Yep. Comes from living in a rarified atmosphere, if only for a short
period of time.  Most of the items on that list (not *all*, mind you,
but the lion's share of the really nice ones) do NOT show up in the
bazaar on our server. Ever.  I don't care HOW much fucking money you
made farming hill giants in Rathe, some of that stuff will never be
available to the average player, or even the somewhat above average.
Even for the ones that do show up, take for example the spider cap.
(HUGELY desired by any wizard, if only for the ID 3 focus effect). I
have FINALLY seen one for sale in the bazaar. 

55K Plat.

How many people have 55K Plat in the bank right now that they could (and
would) blow on a *single* item? No matter how nice the item? Let's leave
out the people in guilds capable of taking down AoW and fighting in VT.
How many people now?

Rather than listening to me, or James, or anyone else here, check your
own server. Either in game, or on your server boards. Pick a class and
see if they have a public channel, and/or if they have a server specific
message board. Ask how many of them have broken that level of Mana on
items, or are even within two hundred of it at level sixty.

If you find more than one in a hundred I'll give you ten stacks of gnome
shaped cookies.
