I've just finished playing EQ for the evening and had a somewhat sour end to
a good days play. Had a good group at the Sarnak Fort in LOIO. I've been
grouped with the same chanter for the last 3 evenings and when he had to go
he was kind enough to find us a replacement, I love grouping with Chanters
so I was more than happy for her to join. My warrior buddy was our main tank
but as another group had set up camp nearby the pulls were not as thick and
fast as usual. While he was off inside the Fort looking for something to
kill she started pulling anything that wandered past us without even
announcing it to the group so the Warrior inside the Fort had no idea that
we were fighting outside. We had one pretty close call in which the tank
almost bought it but we got away with it and he lived. After that I figured
that she would have learned not to jeopardise the group in this manner, how
wrong can you be? The tank was inside looking for a pull, a sarnak wanders
down the ramp in front of us, what does she do? You got it, she pulls him in
unannounced. I had little choice but to wade in there and start fighting,
during this fight I notice that out tanks health was dropping rapidly. Being
a Ranger I could have tracked my way to him, healed him a bit and stepped
into the fight whilst taunting all the way, in short, I'm sure I could have
got him out of there, but due to a lack of patience on her part my buddy got
slain. He went LD shortly after this and I wouldn't be surprised if that was
caused by him pulling the plug on his computer in frustration. I waited for
him to come back but he didn't, I couldn't wait to get out of the group
after that. I'd just hit level 25 and didn't want to lose it for her. She
didn't even say goodbye when we disbanded the group. Needless to say I won't
be grouping with her again.

Sorry for ranting for so long but you didn't have to read it all. I'm also a
little disappointed because one of my best EQ friends told me tonight that
she doesn't really have time for EQ any more :(

I've got my sights set on level 26 before I leave LOIO and it can't come
soon enough. The inane banter that flies around in that zone is second to
none that I've seen.

Be careful out there and look after each other.

Bart
