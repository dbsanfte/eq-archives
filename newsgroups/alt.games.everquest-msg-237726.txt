Yes.

That's not what I mean.

In a godless universe, which would be a universe without free will, I
believe life could exist, after all, it's just a complex pattern of
replication, which can be reproduced on smaller scales trivially using
computer models and such.

If it were 100 years from now, I think my point would be proven and
obvious, because by then, I think we'll have A.I. with levels of
intelligence that rival human beings, which in my mind at least, will
qualify as life.

And then, people can debate whether those A.I.'s have free will.  I
think it will be debatable whether or not God gives free will to
sufficiently advanced intelligences that happen to evolve (whether or
directly or guided by humans minds).
