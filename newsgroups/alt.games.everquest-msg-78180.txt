Thank you for taking over the FAQ, it would be a shame to let all that
work lapse.

I no longer have the time to play EQ, or read this NG very often. I will
not be buying SoL, and will probably cancel my account soon. Therefore I
can no longer keep the FAQ up to date.

I have had an enjoyable time playing the game, but it seems I could
never find the time needed to advance into the higher levels.

James, you may like to remove my name and email address from the FAQ,
and replace it with yours.

One note of caution:

For some reason, bizbee hates the FAQ, and likes to stalk it. It tends
to send him into an apoplectic fit whenever anyone mentions it. Whether
you regard this as a curse or a blessing, I have no idea. Personally, I
found it to be a perk of the job.

Good luck to you all in this newsgroup, even the ones I have argued
bitterly with, and best wishes on your travels in EQ



Taras Bulba
