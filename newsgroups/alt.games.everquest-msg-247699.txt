Being an enchanter myself I'll throw what I know.

I can chain stun so that all creatures are hit by stun before the previous
stun runs out.  However, if one critter resists then they'll get a shot at
me.  Many times if the creature is powerful enough they'll stun me, or
interrupt my stunning.  If this happens then all the critters will beat on
me.  With hardly any HP I go down quick.

You can offset some of this with IS and I imagine having the lightning
reflex line would be helpful too.

With two enchanters even if one resists there's a good chance
the second chanter will stun it.

Just need to watch for the named!  (Cannot be stunned)
