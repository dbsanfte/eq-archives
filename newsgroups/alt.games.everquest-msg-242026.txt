   As you can all see, I lifted alot, switched stuff around for aesthetic
reason, and wrote a bunch of new stuff as well.  And I just realized that I left
out the EQII links that I make reference to in the EQII section.  Well, problem
is is that was alot more work than I thought it would be, and I just ran out of
steam. 

   I still consider this to be a work in progress.   Have you been itching to
have something added to a FAQ?  Write it up, and we'll see how I feel about it. 
Remember that I do reserve the right to make the final call on what goes in or
not, unless someone else wants the job more than me, and there is some sort of
support for the idea that they are better at it than I am.
   
    Also, if you have to fight your spelling/grammar correcting urges every time
you log into this newsgroup, well, this is a perfect time to go nuts and point
out errors.  I'd rather fix them now than later.


 Once there is more or less agreement that it doesn't suck too badly, I will
convert it to HTML and stick it up as a web page.

And before I forget, a hearty thanks! to all who have already contributed, and
who's work I have already cut and pasted in.
