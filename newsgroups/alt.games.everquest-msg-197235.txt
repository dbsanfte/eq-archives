But whats to stop them from dramatically shortening the rot time on the
body?  I remember when they moved the "get in" time from 29 minutes to 31
minutes because of this issue, thinking "thats ridiculous, you just made this
even more annoying, if you had to change something, why not shorten the rot
time to 28 minutes?"  On reflection, I think that time should be the typical
7 minutes of other mobs that happen to drop junk loot all over Norrath.  Then
the "start a new trial" timer could be set at 10 minutes, or even 8 minutes,
instead of 31.  It does -not- take 10 minutes to rez the dead (even if you
are OOM and have no rez stick) and let them loot their marks and their bodies
and get out.

Its also important for their "noone gets a mark that didn't kill the mob"
plan that bodies pop to the graveyard before you kill the exe.  But that
happens now, because at 2 minutes per wave plus 30 seconds between waves, you
go over "pop to GY" time before the executioner even shows up, MB him to the
ground (like you had the mana by then) instantly and its still too late.

The 30 minute timer is whats annoying for the people who are called in as
ringers.  You already have a flag, and have subsequently leveled up to 65
with improved gear, you and 5 similar buddies come in to get your lower level
pal flagged.  If its just one person, heck, you come in, take 5 minutes
getting ready, 10 minutes to do the trial, and you are out of there.  If you
fail (and you still will sometimes) its usually another 3 or 4 minutes to get
ready again and back you go (assuming no line)  But if its two or three
people that need flagged (and when its a guild exercise, it usually is more
than one) then after success you have to sit on your can for 30 minutes,
despite being FM and buffed up again in three minutes time.  Then you go in,
make it, another 30 minute wait.  With a 50% fail rate, you end up averaging
around an hour per flag over the first one.  Five people, five hours.  And
thats assuming you are good enough that you only fail half the time despite
having a low level, low DPS  person in your group who's never done this
successfully and is relying solely on descriptions of how it really works,
and that "fails" are generally clean ones, not wipes, wipes eat at least 15
minutes of your time.

If there are other people there doing trials, fails take average 6 minutes,
so its not a big deal to take turns... but if they succeed you get punished
by another grueling 30 minute wait for no reason; its nothing you did, after
all.  5 ringers, plus probably a couple ancillary people there to buff people
in the "go group" with buffs that aren't represented in the trial group
itself.  For hours at a time, and at least 20 minutes of each of those hours
is currently there -only- because you literally can't get in till after that
30 minute rot time is over.

What is it that forces the executioner's body to take 30 minutes to decay?
And whatever that is, what would happen if that was changed?  Not being a
programmer, perhaps there are very solid reasons why it has to work this way,
that a change would require changing rot times on "boss mobs" the world
over... but I've yet to see anyone suggest that they heard this stated in an
official explanation.
