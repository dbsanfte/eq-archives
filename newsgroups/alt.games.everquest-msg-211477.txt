if you were tanking, you would have been dealt a lot more dps than 47, heh

anyway, you should try to parse at least a dozen fights, then throw out the
highest and lowest, then average the 10 remaining fights

that will give you a much better idea of your dps in that situation
(positioning, weapon, buffs, haste, etc)

and i say this because dps is honestly, for all classes and all levels, a
range, a variable,  never an actual constant number
