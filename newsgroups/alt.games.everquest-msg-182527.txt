ACK.  That really came out ALL WRONG.

/me smacks himself repeatedly.

My apologies if I made anyone angry by saying that.  What I
typed is not what I meant.

By "anti-racism" I really mean people who would sweep all our
differences under the rug as ignorable and unimportant.  My
message was merely trying to point out that race often is
important, and shouldn't be swept under the rug, like when
you're dealing with medicine.

I certainly don't promote racism.  Sorry for the terribly
poorly worded original message.
