    Looking through my current EQ log: the average hit on my from a mob is
233, and over the course of an everage fight I expect 2-4 ripostes, or
around 700 damage, in total, from ripostes. I use a WMBS and a soulscream
belt, usually with shammy haste. These mobs are PoV and Veksar, mostly. Now
then, were I to use a windblade instead of my riposte-bait weapon, I might
save, what, 250 damage per fight?

    It is my feeling that riposte damage is vastly overrated. The only time
it's really been an issue for me was the second time I tanked Remains of
Synthrax - I was watching MY hitpoint bar instead of his when he hit 10%,
and I lost a lot of hits to the enrage before I managed to get autoattack
turned off. I put this down more to stupidity than weapon choice, however.
That fight showed a whopping 12 ripostes on poor Kuloth.

    There are two very good reasons to choose a WMBS over a windblade, and
one minor one.

    1) It doesn't look even remotely like a tennis racket
    2) On my server (povar) and at the time I bought mine, they were half
the price, due to everyone being so convinced that the windy is a superior
weapon
    3) It does slightly more damage.

    Having said that, in pure mathematical terms, either weapon is extremely
cool, and having one in my opinion certainly means you needn't by the other.

cheers,
James
