Now we're complaining because someone isn't giving away 1/10 of there
*total* income? Give me a break .5% in this case would still be a huge
contribution. Personally, I hope that no matter how wealthy I may get,
no one expects be to shell out 10% of my paycheck *before taxes*.

I'm no Gates groupie by any stretch, but let's keep it in perspective.
