Hiya,

couldnt agree more =) Finally they have done it , WOOT !

Maybe we now will see again chars that have learned their class ... if you
see druids that die like flies on the wall in EW because they dont even know
the usage of  their spell "panic animal" you only can shake your head ...

And for all the whiners : if you choose a group-class and now you complain
you cant solo ... whats the point ?

Its not only Kei that got "nerfed" (I prefer fixed) ... also we wont see
level 1 chars with 1k hps and nearly maxed stats anymore ...
Think the nearly forgotten lower-level classes like enchanters, shamans ect
will have luck again if looking for groups ...

Good work with this patch SOE ( I never thought I would say this ;-))

Have fun in game

Christian
