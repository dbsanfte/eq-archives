Because it is far preferable not to have to resort to that, but, in some 
cases, it can be necessary.

If you are going to use that as an argument, why quote at all?

Aside from all that, some people, Bizbee is one, post with X-NOARCHIVE, 
so, none of his posts are archived at google, or most anywhere else.

The point to quoting and snipping is to leave the context so that the 
particular subthread can be followed.  It is then much easier to follow 
if it is bottom posted.
