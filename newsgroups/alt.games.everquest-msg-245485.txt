    I think it's pretty clear that SOE has made the choice and is slowly
but surely switching over to it.  Wouldn't surprise me if the boat gnomes
never went away.

   You are certainly entitled to that view.  I happen to disagree though. 
I never did understand why being forced to spend a half hour more or less
traveling from place to place did anything to improve the game.  Yes, some
people enjoyed meeting other travelers.  And yes, it did make the world
seem large.  But people are still interacting with each other in hunting
grounds and in meeting places such as the PoK and the bazaar, not to
mention chat channels.  And I dunno, but being able to reach dozens of
richly varied hunting grounds quickly also makes the world seem large.

   For me, traveling did not seem hard (though it did have it's perils). 
It did nothing to add to the challenge or fun of the game.  It just slowed
things down.  I do not consider forced time sinks to be fun.  I know that
when there where times when I only had an hour to play, I might as well not
logged on if I knew I wanted to travel from Gfay to Freeport because most
of that time would be given over to a boring chore.
