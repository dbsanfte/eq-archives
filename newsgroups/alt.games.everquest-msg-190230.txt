I guess simple minds have simple replies.

Anyway, I guess should have stated what was on my mind a little more
clearly.

It seems to me that the millions of plat that Yantis is
selling/pumping into EQ servers every day has to have an impact on the
EQ economy.  I was looking at the sales history per playerauctions & I
can't help but think that all that plat has to have an impact.  Yantis
is currently selling 100k pp for less than $250.  He sells millions of
pp every day on each server.  I was looking at an item in the bazaar
that should have cost 45k per my research.  It was selling for 135k.

Has anyone else noticed that the prices in the bazaar are getting out
of line?
