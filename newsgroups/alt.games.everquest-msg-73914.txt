What I would like to figure out is if there are some general rules of
thumb for determining the price of an item.  Some sort of formula
which relates weapon ratio, AC, stats, weight, procs, etc. to price. 
I can understand where the prices for player trade skill made items
come from, but how the heck does the price for dropped items get
determined?

At http://www.the-moat.com/everquest/ there are downloadable lists of
items, and many have prices attached.  However, the price an item goes
for, I understand, is different from server to server.
