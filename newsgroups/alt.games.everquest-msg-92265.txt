My whole issue with the zone/script design isn't the "one-time"
nature of it.   It's the lack of repercussions of doing so.

Monumental actions should hold both monumental rewards
as well as monumental repercussions.  There should be a
*balance* of events.  Without that, it's only human nature to
act out of self-interest.  And that, regardless of what you want
to believe, is why a large number of guilds woke the Sleeper.
Yes, there's a certain, non-loot reward for being the guild that
woke the Sleeper.  But *no one* woke the Sleeper until they were
done farming loot from the zone.

IMO, if VI wanted lasting change, they should have made sure there
was a *risk* other than doing a nasty CR if you failed.  Get the last
warder to 50% health and hear "The tomb resonates to a mighty
voice, "Beware mortals!!  Dragonkind will remember this day if the
Sleeper awakes!!  We swear to avenge this day if you wake him!!"
Then put faction hits on everyone present, alive or rezzable when
the script runs.  And put something in the game that acts on that
faction hit.

That type of consequence is already in the game for some things.
There's simply no way to reverse some actions.   IMO, an action
which can't be reversed (waking the Sleeper) begs for that type
of consequence.  "Beating the top challenge" should have a risk
appropriate to the reward.  It didn't and that's just stupid, IMO.

Hunting in PoG for a druid or ranger carries a lot of risk, IIRC.
You're hunting your loving god's creatures and it's remembered
forever.  Why didn't wakening the Sleeper -- with in-game logic
every bit as reasonable as far as CoV faction goes -- carry the
same type of consequences?
