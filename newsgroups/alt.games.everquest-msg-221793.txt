Move along folks, nothing to see here. It's a really, really horrible
camp! <g>

Think of it as a pulling tool, an insta-click invis you can cast while
on the run. Of the SKs and necros that I know with one, I doubt they'd
take 100k for theirs if they knew they couldn't get a replacement.

Yeah, it gets better once your groups get used to the place. There's
always a spot where mobs won't agro within easy reach if you see IVU
start to blink.

Do SKs get an AA ability with instacast IVU? If so, combine that with
a CoS and I could see it. Snare and feign to split off the named on
the original pull, invis (or IVU) past everything else as you walk the
mob to camp? I've never really asked how they do it, but damn it's
impressive when I do see it <g>. Admittedly, they only seem to do it
in places like Veksar and Droga where mobs don't see invis. Never seen
em do it in Sebilis for example. There's a reason why I've long
considered SKs the best pullers for exp groups.
