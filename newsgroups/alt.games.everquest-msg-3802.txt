My rogue was only level 7.  He was there to get the corpse of my wizard,
who was 39 at the time.  I knew about the hide/sneak thing, so
hide/snuck before getting into the water.  My wizard's corpse was in the
water, so the rogue was able to drag him to a place he could get to his
corpse from, and then my rogue discovered the "can't jump out of the
water with low swimming skill" thing.  By turning off sneak, he was able
to just barely swim fast enough to swim to the underwater zone to upper
Guk without drowning.

Cool.  I'll have to twink my current rogue (level 5 halfling at the
moment) with some stamina gear.  (Why two rogues?  This one is on the
second account, so it's easier for my now 50 wizard to help him, and
also I can port him with the wizard if I need to use him for corpse
recovery.  Why halfling?  Because they start with hide and sneak at 50,
and by worshipping Brell, I can go explore the Hole if I want).
