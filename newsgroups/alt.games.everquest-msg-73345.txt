Is it just me, or does this appear to be a new post while the body gives
the impression of being part of a different thread??

Is this part of another thread?  Am I yet another victim of newsfeed
latency? Was the subject line changed?  Did OE suddenly loose its
ability to thread?  Does Velma really not understand what's going on
between Fred and Daphne?  Is it really necessary to make another
Rambo movie?  Can I think of more stupid questions?  Will the
caffeine eventually wear off? *rambles on for awhile*
