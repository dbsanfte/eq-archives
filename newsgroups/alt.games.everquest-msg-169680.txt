Your obnoxious elitism and refusal to accept other people dont play
the game to provide you with an environment exactly as you like
strikes me as the epitome of rude offensiveness.

Well, I think we should boot you from the group for it. As a clear
message and all, you understand.

It would appear, kaev, that you have no common goals with certain other
players of EQ, but rather seek to impose your goals on them.

Thats nice. I am sure all the people who enjoy spending 2 hours
trading incomprehensible dialect strewn gibberish at each other
instead of grinding out the most efficient XP possible will be dying
to appeal to your sense of fun now they know it wont get them kicked
out of your groups.

Out of curiosity, if you were in a group with someone you found
incomprehsnible, that you'd started, and nobody else had a problem
with that person, would you leave or would you kick them out as a
message not to be so 'stupid' ?
