I didn't accurately portray what would happen.  I would send a tell hello,
for example.  I'd get, "ellos.  Whatcha doin?"   "I'm doing an LDoN, you?"
[5 mins later...]    "I'm doing an LDoN, you?"   "sec"     "Are ya doing an
LDoN?"   "sorry, your tells are flying by"
"I'm starting the LDoN, did you get that tell?"    "yes"     [pulling MY
HAIR OUT]

She would respond, but in monosyllabic, distracted ways.  Maybe she was
doing drugs, killing her brain cells.  Maybe she was just stupid, I don't
know, but that was the kind of thing that ticked me off.  And, like a
masochist, I would still try to talk to her, to be friendly.  She had me
wondering about her.  It was all a game, I just didn't know when to forget
her I guess.  I should have forgotten her shortly after I met her and she
began to tell me about her husband.
