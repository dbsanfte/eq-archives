very true, but most shamans in their 30's are only beginning to know what
canni is, unless they've got lots of experience on other [higher up]
characters

<bitter> god forbid we look up info about our classes or check out forums,
or do some other such "work" other than spamming PoK with questions, since
it's 'just a game' (also acceptable: why should i trade my hp for mana, when
i just need to spend mana to get my hp back up? that doesn't make any sense!
stop telling me how to play my class! i have a lvl 66 nazi shadowknight and
i'll KS your mom and petition your dog!)  </bitter> =P
