Hi,

After going up to thurgadin to buy the Coldain velium great staff for
my dark elf necro, i found it and payed 180pp for it, later i took the
trip with my dark elf enchanter and he could have bought it(didn't
have that much money) for 168pp, what makes the difference here? both
was here for the first time, had killed nothing (could not) 12pp is
rather much for me that is being untwinked.

My guys are Thotamon lvl 16 dark elf necromancer
and Nexxius lvl 4 dark elf enchanter.

Thanks for your time

/Regards Berth
