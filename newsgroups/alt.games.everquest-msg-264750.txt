The recipe's level 5, I believe.

The pouches are really backpacks (weight 5.0!) and cannot be made with the
materials sold by the vendor.  You must make your own higher-quality leather
to have any chance of success.  If you get a "normal" or "pristine" piece of
leather, you may be able to make a 6-slot backpack from it.  Better chance
with the higher piece, obviously.

I've made 3 "normal" backpacks and 1 "pristine" backpack so far (no
difference in stats that I can see).  I've made a bunch of "crude" and
"shaped" which I filled my bank account with and then destroyed the rest.
