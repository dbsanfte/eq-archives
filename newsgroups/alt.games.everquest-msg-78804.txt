I put my fastest weapon in my main hand, and then the second fastest in my
off hand. However, if I was to get a faster weapon that did less damage than
my main, then I'd be tempted to put that in my off hand. At the moment, my
rogue's weaons have the same delay, so the most damaging is in the main.
