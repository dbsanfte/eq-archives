There's simply no comparison between the ease of crafted and totemic in
terms of completing the quests. My warrior had a full set of crafted at
not much higher than the OP's level, and that was without much outside
help beyond a couple people. The werewolf talon from MM is the one
serious PITA drop to get for that set. (For the BP as I recall.)

Totemic, on the other hand, can drive a good shaman insane. I too have
spent many levels on several different characters hunting in SK, and
I've never seen Gristleknot once in almost three years.
