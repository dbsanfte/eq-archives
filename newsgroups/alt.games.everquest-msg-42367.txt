I was level 43 druid and I was helping a level 29 shaman friend get some
quick exp in Iceclad. I would quad kite some wolves and I would get half a
blue and she would get one and a half blue bubbles.  But the wolves were
blue to me then, now that I am 44 they have greened out mostly, question to
the group is...

Since I can obviously group with a 29 and share exp how would it work (for
experience distribution) if were to quad kite cougars, very green to me but
red/yellow to her?   Does the MOB have to be at a level that we both would
get exp or would she just get ALL the exp herself? or would she only get
29/73 of the exp still?

Thanks for info,
