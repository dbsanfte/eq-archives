Were you guilded at the time?

Don't forget being anonymous doesn't help, you only need to target and do a
guildstatus to find out where someone belongs.

I can remember a while back when we were in PC where we had one hill, and
there was a person being PL'd over on the other hill.  Things were okay
until he wasn't getting enough action so he started to come over and pull
the mobs from our side and things got really nasty.  (wasn't interested in
the fiends, just the recondites).
They called someone else in from their guild (the PL'er had their tag
hidden, the lower PC had no tag) who then proceeded to train us and KS all
the mobs in the area.  No GM was available, and even though I had the whole
thing in eqlog.txt apparently that can't be used as evidence of what had
gone on.
Needless to say I will never help  or group with any of them, and if I ever
get asked why in game, I will be nice about it.
Why? Because I would not want to give my guild a bad reputation.
