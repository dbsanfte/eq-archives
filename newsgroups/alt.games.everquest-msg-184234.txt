Reminds of a while back when I saw a Dark Elf SK resting by LS zone. I did a
quick inspect saw nothing twinked, all leather and raw hide with a couple of
small peices of the new quest armours, so I started to unload some goodies
only to get them rejected ??? I was then told that the Main for this
character was a 60 in one of BB's top teir guilds, I think was Circle of
Legends but it was a while back now, and wanted to play a character without
twinking for once. Have to admit I felt a little foolish at that point :ï¿½)
