Before I got into EQ, I always bought new games. ANd even for awhile
afterward. I got all the greats: Starcraft, every WC game out there, Diablo
1 and 2, Freespace series, scores of old and semi-new star wars titles,
Black and White... the list goes on.

And I DON'T PLAY ANYTHING BUT EQ. :)

Anyone else do something like this?
