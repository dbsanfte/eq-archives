 Everyone pays that dude, so like whats your point? I have been with Ford
since 1988. I pay less then any Associate, Z, or X plan buyer, and Damn sure
pay less then the average consumer. What, you think they only charge
employee's the overhead ?

 Oh, and research the "Holdback" charges a little more. Holdback charges
come from the difference between MSRP and DAC stupid. And the dealer gets an
additional 3% back as a burden rate for handling A plan sells dipwad. The
actual invoice is from FoMoCo, to said employee. Dealership isn't even on
contract.

 Now, don't bother with a reply, you already look real stupid playing
pretend.
