Hopefully anyone else watching it saw through the poorly-executed (IMHO) farce
and saw it for what it was.

If EQ is responsible for that young man's death, shouldn't the pizza shop that
delivered food directly to his house also be held accountable?  After all,
they facilitated his addiction by providing him with sustenance so that he
didn't have to leave.

And while I don't mean to trivialize his death, either, it is obvious that he
had much more serious problems than playing EQ.  Online relationships
shouldn't be a replacement for real life.  And if it *was* an online rejection
that drove him to suicide (with a character name of "iloveyou" I think it was,
sounds like he wasn't primarily there for the roleplaying aspect, IMHO), then
EQ isn't the source, just the medium.  It could just as easily have been an
AOL Chat Room.

And as for the women who have addicted husbands... one, sounds like there's
deeper problems in the marriage if this is a serious problem.  Better work on
your communication skills and talk to your hubby to discover the real issues,
don't blame EQ as the cause - it's just a symptom.  Two, learn how to use the
"uninstall" command.  It's not that difficult.

And granted it wasn't online, but D&D has existed for YEARS.  And it too was
blamed for a multitude of things.
