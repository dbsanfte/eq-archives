Agreed on that one, take a look at Oasis for example. Almost everyone just let
their dead crocks lie with meat on them, and it actually get hard to see if
there is any live crocks nearby with 5+ bodies lying around.
Same in WC, people kill bears for the HQ bear skins, but leave the rest, so as a
baker i generally loot any dead bear i pass by, so i can get the bear meat.
