Learning to type etni from the home keys is something like a game.  I
hope this layout will prove useful to someone.  I love it, I only wish
there were some way to objectively prove its worth.

Aset keyboard
It has been said that the most common letters were taken off the home
row of the first typewriter keyboard to slow down the typist and
prevent jamming.
On a Dvorak keyboard almost sixty percent of average text is typed from
the home keys.  Transposing the letters 'etni' with 'dfjk'  would put
more than 55% of text on the home keys, up from only 26% on the qwerty
layout.  Thats more than twice the text typed without lifting a finger.

The change is quite pleasant and easy to learn.  I hope you will pass
this on.

To put e, t, n and i back where they belong, there is a keyboard
remapping program that is free, downloads quickly and is very easy to
use.  I am typing this post on a keyboard remapped to the 'etni'
transposition layout.  The program is called 'Keytweak 2.11' and can be
googled up by that name.  It is available from several sites, including
PC magazine.

1)  After you have loaded the program click start.
2)  Click the "KeyTweak" icon and a graphic of a keyboard will appear.
3)  Click the "Full Teach Mode" at the bottom of the screen.
4)  A box will appear.  Click "Begin Teach Mode".
5)  Press the key you want to reassign, then the key you want it
reassigned to, in this case D to E.
6)  Click "Remap Key#1 to Key#2"
7)  The box will disappear and the scancodes of the keys will appear in
the "Pending Changes" window at the bottom right.
8)  Follow the same procedure (from 3) for E to D, and the remaining
six remaps.
9)  Click "Apply" and you will be asked if you want to turn off the
computer to apply the changes.
     At the top there is also a clickable "Restore Defaults" to give
you back your qwerty layout.
     I was able to remap in under three minutes and restore qwerty in
thirty seconds, not including the restart.

You can try out the sample lines of text below to discover that your
fingers already know where etni should go.
