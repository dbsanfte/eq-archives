This seems to come up here a couple times a year.  Consider that people
buy/sell in-game stuff (gear and pp) for RL cash.  If you're gambling
with stuffs that have a demonstrable $ value, governments _will_ look
upon it as gambling, which in the good ol' USofA is gonna run afoul of
the law (federal and state) big time.  SOE really can't implement
gambling in EQ without getting themselves into serious legal hot water.
