Conventional wisdom is wrong. Which is precisely why I feel it worthwhile to
point out the fallacy. You even have some of the druids snowed. They believe
that they are good soloers since so many have said for so long and so loud
that they are. I have a fairly unique perspective limited to members of the
upper class of eq players, the uber guild member. On any particular day if I
so desired I could play any class at level 60 . We have that many floating
accounts due to attrition over 3 years.

For the normal eq player they have to think about it and watch a bit. You
have to realize that soloing is done for either experience, loot , or both.
If you are soloing for experience the only important stat is experience per
time period. If you are soloing for loot the only important stat is how
tough a mob or group of mobs you can manage.

If you want observable phenomena its not hard . You can go watch a single 50
shaman solo ice giants outside perma . He can keep all the giants dead i.e.
keep up with the spawn rate. A 50 druid can kill an ice giant either root
dotting or snare nuking, he cannot quad them. He also cannot keep up with
the spawn rate , no matter how hard he tries he is not going to have them
all dead at the same time like a shaman can. The 50 wizard can quad them.
The 50 chanter can get them all as well though the risk is higher and may
require zoning a couple of times.

Another observable phenomena would be the old s karana crowd. At this level
it is unlikely to find druids root dotting (rotting) since it is actually
less efficient. What you will find them doing is snare nuking. snare run a
bit nuke, run a bit more nuke etc till dead. Now something most people dont
realize is that you do not have to snare the mob. Even as a druid it is
entirely possible to just run nuke run nuke as long as your nuke casts fast
and you are faster than the mob i.e jboots , or a sow , this is how wizards
solo till 29 and because of the superiority of his nukes he does better.
Another way to do this is to nuke then root and then nuke then root till
dead though the cost of the root significantly impacts your mana cost.
Clerics have to spend the cost of the root. Chanters have to spend the cost
of a level 4 mez (superior for this versus root) but have clarity always up
, this leads them to doing this better (faster) than druids.

Once you realize that soloing is not the sole ownership of the druid and
necro you begin to wonder why you see so many of them soloing. This
observation coupled with the observation that many other classes can solo as
well or better will eventually lead to some wisdom and understanding about
the matter.
