Oh, please, tell me, then... How am I unqualified to make a judgement
about the general populace of a state I have lived in for almost my
ENTIRE FUCKING LIFE? Where am I wrong? Alabama is an extremely
conservative place to the point of stupidity (Heck, just try to go to
a grocery store and buy alcohol on Sunday). Alabama does one of the
worst educational systems in the entire country. Alabama does have the
one of most backwards governments in the country.

Now, nowhere did I EVER say that EVERYONE in the state was a redneck
idiot. But there is a higher idiot density here that in other parts of
the country.

But, then, I guess I know nothing about the place I grew up in, huh?
