No I would hazard a guess at Danish holding the first language slot.

Trying to make a profit on a resale of an item is a waste of time, imo, now.
As for best item(s) well that's easy, the one(s) you KNOW are being sold
*very* cheap and will sell, quickly, for a lot more.
You won't make a profit buying and selling gems unless you get any dropped,
quest, gems really cheap and this isn't likely.
