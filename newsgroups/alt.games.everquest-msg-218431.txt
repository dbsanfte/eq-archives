Hmm.  No, I'm not the one that *never* needs more than 20% mana
on a pull.  Thats Your position.  You see, if you pull at 20M and
you frequently need more than 20M, then you die a lot... but you
claim you play to win.  Only way that will work is if you
"*never* need more.  

Now if you Usually need no more than 20M on a pull, and you pull
with 20M, then you sometimes wipe due to LOM.  If you pull at 80M
and Usually need no more than 20M on a pull, then you sometimes
dip below 60M... and breath a sigh of relief that Faned wasn't
pulling.

Wherever you pull, if you Ever need more mana than you pulled
with (counting of course mana regened during the battle) then
those times are a wipe.  

When your "usual" mana needed for a pull is the same as the mana
pool available for the pull, then you wipe whenever you go over
the "usual".  When you pull with 2x or 3x the "usual" you have
margin for error.

Now, if you could show that there was some advantage to pulling
while LOM, you could weigh that against the value of that
margin.  But since mana regen rates are the same regardless of
how much mana is in your pool, that case doesn't apply; you have
the same mana income during the hour as the group which has 50M
more in its pool during all normal play.

If you need some lessons in Modal Logic (which is where the
dangers of casual use of words like Never, Always, and Sometiems
are disected) you could try reading up on the subject, I can
probably Ask Jeeves for a few pages on the topic if I have to.
