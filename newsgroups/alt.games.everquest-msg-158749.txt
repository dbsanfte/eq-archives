That way, you couldn't bind right next to Mr. Uber Mob,
> loot, and continue tanking.

So is this why it was not done in the first place?  It would be unbalancing
to let a dead character repop close to the action and finish the MOB?  Why
did it seem ok for casters and not for tanks?  I don't get it? A tank would
still need to loot his/her body before he could start fighting again which
could be very dangerous while naked.

One time as my rogue I was bound at the gypsy camp in North Karana.  I was
sitting on top of one of the tents waiting for a rezz and watching all of
the activity below me.  It was a pretty long wait, because it had been a TPW
and I was low on the list and during the half hour or so I saw at least 6
people pop in and get attacked almost immediately and killed again by lions,
bears, griffawns etc...  The middle of North Karana is a pretty dangerous
bind point for a melee character with no gear or weapon.
