Quite simple there... They're humans and, thus, imperfect. Seems
something trivial to fault them over, since it didn't hurt anything.

Thing is, EQ is HUGE. Thousands (literally) of NPCs, mobs, quests,
items, etc, etc, etc. Sometimes a change on something that seems it
should be completely unconnected can impact something else. Now,
granted, they COULD give the game a complete scrub-down hunt for bugs
every single patch, but that would be such a huge undertaking that I
guarantee you we'd be paying at least double per month what we're
paying now just so that the income from the game is enough to justify
the manpower and time investment.
