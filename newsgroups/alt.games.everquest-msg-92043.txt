Something else I might add here, get good at switching weapons in
mid-fight. Some blues can wail on you pretty darn good and switching
to your main weapon can save you alot of down time between fights as
well as saving your butt. 

Currently I have a  hand slash as my main with a fast one hand blunt
as my second, I do not see much increase in my second, which is my
poor skill. I do see the skill go up much faster with it in my prime
hand and a shield in my second, thus ( I think) stopping the 2 hand
weild. Now I could be all wet on this as the message scrolls move
pretty fast and I go by my log parser as much as anything
