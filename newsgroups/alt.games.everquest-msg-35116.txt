You can, as stated earlier, use your log and parser, to get this info.
However, I wish there was an in-game command for this. One of the
features on the MUD I used to play (Asgard's Honor) was a 'deaths'
command.  It would show you the when you died, what killed you, the
level you where at, and what the con of the MOB was to you at the time.
