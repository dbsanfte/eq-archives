It is however excellent for healing against rampage mobs.  Great efficiency,
and slows down attacks enough that they lose thier spot on the rampage list.

Hell, as ST on the last Irator Vius raid, I requested that a shaman be added
to our group just for this purpose.  (I have AE taunt, so being somewhat low
on the aggro list doesn't hurt me in a MT transition.)  Worked a hell of a lot
better than trying to beg for an off heal from one of the druids in chat,
while blinded.

This wasn't directed at me, but yeah, I agree with you.  Because of nature's
touch, Druids make better patch healers.


*sigh*  Looking back at the thread now (I was skipping around) I see that this
is in response to a repeat of "Druids must have complete heal"  I'd just like
to make it clear that I don't support that position, although I'm not going to
delete this post.  (I already typed it up, why not send it?)
