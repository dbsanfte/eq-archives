There never seems to be a story about the guy who committs suicide
watching TV. People can watch TV 12 hours a day, but spend your
evening playin EQ, and it is an addiction. The woman on 20/20
complained about her son playing all night, but IMHO they had stayed
up all night watching TV on many occasions too.

People stimulate thier mind with the game, it's not just sitting
there. If you are an unstable personality, it's going to shake things
up. I liked Ben Stien, but, I think the "addiction" he complains about
with EQ has root causes elsewhere.
