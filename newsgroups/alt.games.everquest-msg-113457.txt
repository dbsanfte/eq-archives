Well, there's always quad kiting dwarves.

At level 51, I found DL to be pretty decent for soloing, I would just hang
out on the south side of KC, most people tend to hang out at the ruins
scattered about, or on the North side.  There were still plenty of dark blue
mobs there to kill off with root and rot.  I can't think of any dungeon off
hand that you can do solo at 51, and get good xp.  Being a druid, outside
zones are generally best for your soloing career.  Most of the quad kiting
areas are usually overcamped.  I haven't really put a lot of time into
soloing for a few levels now, so I'm really not sure what is decent now.  I
know that Wyverns in CS work pretty well, but there are usually too many
druids and wizards there already for precisely that reason.
