Oh, that reminds me.

I know lots of people are having trouble with recent patches.  My
experience is just the opposite!

Without making a single driver change, EQ is no longer locking up
solid on me!  I'm joyously happy.  :)  I don't know what Verant has
changed, but the lack of lock ups has sure improved my gaming
experience.

The sound works better, too.  Woo hoo!

Mr. Jekke: You were wrong and I was right.  :P
