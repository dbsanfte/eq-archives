}He was talking about it in serverwide last night (I think that was
}him). He just wants mobs that fight each other so he can kill the
}weakened one for exp, as far as I know. Nothing sinister.

Regardless of why he, in particular, wants it, I've long wished for such a 
database of faction interactions.  Something where I could look up a 
faction, and it would say "the following factions will actually engage 
mobs of this faction: " and "the following factions will assist this 
faction in battle: " and then, of course, a complete listing of the 
race and religion faction modifiers for that faction.  It just woulda been 
nice to know that the recuso would assist the grey rockhoppers beforehand. 
:)

The problem is, as evidenced by the database at allakhazam, it's many 
times difficult to even establish which faction a mob is on.  Largely, 
this is due to people assuming that every mob in a zone is on the same 
faction, or every mob with the same model is on the same faction.  I'm 
sure we can all think of counterexamples, like when I told that paladin 
yesterday "Don't kill Brother Gruff... doh!".  But people will still keep 
asking, "I'm a race such-and-such, will I be KoS in zone X?" and we'll 
keep having to try to explain that it also depends on religion, where 
else they may have hunted, and what quests they did, as well as which 
particular mobs in zone X they're talking about.

Still, it's a worthy project.  If I knew more about fancy-schmancy stuff 
like php and SQL, I'd consider taking it on. :)

To contribute to the current list, though, let me add:

- Newbie guards vs. newbie mobs. :)
