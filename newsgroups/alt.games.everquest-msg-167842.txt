I know you CAN buy the red sash and purple headband but I'd like to quest
these.  It seems like I've been killing orcs in the Nektulos forest for
ages.  There are 3 camps that I hit for a total of 23 kills and with SOW i
can hit all 3 camps before they repop, so I'm killing 23 orcs in 6 minutes
roughly and as I understand each orc is 1 faction hit.  My question is, I am
somewhere in the "threateningly" stage.  I know I have to be higher then
indifferent so how many orcs am I looking at killing, or if you are bored,
what is the amount of Time I am looking at.

Also if you have a link to faction numbers that would be greatly
appreciated.
