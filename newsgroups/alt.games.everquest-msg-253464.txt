Of course he wasn't trying to get aggro off me.   In the old days though,
back before I cancelled my account, when the two of us were in equivalent
gear, it was a daily struggle to maintain aggro control over him.

Read again, this time not just looking for what you want to hear.   "Using
no special tactics other than incite" was what I said.   As in, I did not
switch to my most aggro weapons that have less DPS, nor was I watching
positioning and everything else that I used to.  Obviously I was meleeing
normally.

Ah yes.  I remember why I don't bother reading your posts.   The
condecending attitude from an idiot that thinks being in a high end guild
means he knows anything at all.
