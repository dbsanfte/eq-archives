I used to try to sell stuff in the bazaar, but the problem is that 
they've so trivialized the first 50 levels of the game compared with how 
it was a year or two ago that nobody in that level range wants ot needs 
to buy the stuff I can get at level 65. So I rarely even bother trying 
to sell stuff any more. I suspect I'm not the only one.
