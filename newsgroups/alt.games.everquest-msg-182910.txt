Drawing upon my skills from back in my counterstrike days, I can translate
this guy's post.

"I have a large penis.  Other people have small penises.  I enjoy jizzing in
the face of people with smaller penises than myself.  Worship my large
penis.

Sometimes when a person logs on in the same space as you, you will be
slightly moved. This can cause you to be pushed away etc. Also some traders
warp invisible after a while (a known bug, don't know if this has been
fixed).

Did I mention that my penis is larger than yours?  It is."
