Screw up brand new quests from brand new zones?  Maybe you're a Warrens
expert, I certainly am not, but are screwed up quests a problem there?  I
haven't heard of any, but I may have missed those posts.  If my suspicions
are correct, what makes you think that they'll screw up a bunch of quests in
the new land?

And if they do screw up quests...which ones will be affected?  It ain't
gonna be high level quests, so the Trivial Loot code shouldn't come into
play at all.

I can't think of any particularly interesting pieces of Warrens loot.  What
did you have in mind?
