1.  Your "hard work" is hardly being "rendered pointless" by the
upcoming changes.

2.  No "asswipe" is getting anything "HANDED to them on a fucking PLATE!"

You know, the decaffeinated brands taste almost as good...

Yes, it is, and for the same reasons.  But I'll be kind enough not
to spell them out.

And you're wrong on both counts.

I see...  Just how big of an accomplishment was a "level 6 CR out into
East Commons"?  Let's see...  Walk out, find corpse, loot corpse --
and you had 24 hours of time to do it before your "precious new
banded mail" evaporated.

Yeah, baby, I spent three minutes walking back to where I was,
in a wide-open zone where wanderers can be spotted from hundreds
of  yards away and given a wide berth, someone give me a medal...

The "joke" isn't that level 6 people won't have to do that anymore,
the joke is that you ever thought it was some sort of noble
accomplishment which will tragically be forever lost from the annals
of human achievement.

And they'll still have to do it starting at level 10.  Checking
my logs, I see that my own totally untwinked, totally unassisted,
totally unacquainted with the game journey from 1-10 took
a whopping fifteen days.  Out of the almost two years it
has taken me to reach level 56.  So the change would have
affected no more than 1% of my "EQ life", even if had been
implemented two years ago instead of now.  Just how is this
"get everything HANDED to them on a fucking PLATE!"?


>Now every twinkass lowbie in full Crafted can treat risk/reward with utter
>contempt because there is NO risk anymore....

For only the first, fastest, 9 levels, which most people
get through in about one week.  They'll hit level 10 soon
enough and get back on the same treadmill you love so much.

Yeah, so?  Like looting a corpse in a newbie zone was that
big of an obstacle in the first place?  And they'll still
zap back to their bind point, which puts a crimp in your
"just keep on going".  They still have to hike back out to
their hunting zone to get back in business again, or
figure a better place to hike out to in order to try
instead.

You need to work on your reading comprehension.

Did I say "everything was that broken"?  Why no, I didn't.

Stop trying to treat everything as extremes.

Oh, puh-leaze...

When you were sitting there for 34 levels staring at
a spellbook, were you *really* thinking, "man, if
they removed this book from in front of my face, this
game would become *too* easy"?  Or were you instead
thinking, "this is stupid, if I have to sit on my
ass frantically meditating back mana most of the
time, I wish I could at least *watch* what the other
people in the group were doing for a bit of
entertainment"?

When you were smashed by an orc for the twentieth
time at level 8 and found yourself back at your
bindpoint yet again, were you *really* thinking,
"man, if I didn't have to pick up my gear once
I got back to my group, this game would be *too* easy"?

...and part of that reason is because the "risk" side of
the "risk/reward" equation for gaining levels encouraged
people to exp-grind in safe, predictable ways and places.

What you're missing is that with some of the "penalty" 
portions being eased a bit, people might actually
(*gasp*) go into dungeons while they're still low enough
level to learn something about it.

They might actually experiment with different pulling
and fighting techniques if every experiment wasn't
likely to end in a required corpse run or exp loss.

Yes, they *could* have been learning it as early as level 5, but
they didn't want to lose hard-won exp or guarantee a corpse
run if their "learning by doing" didn't quite work out.

*This* is what you fail to see -- the changes being proposed
actually ENCOURAGE EARLY EXPERIMENTATION.  That's *why*
they're being put into the game.  It's not some conspiracy
to "shaft" you.


>But let's not burden these poor people with all that pointless learning and
>experience, shall we?

Right, let's do it *your* way, where every attempt to learn
something by early experimentation gets an automatic pain-in-the-ass
penalty attached to it.  And then you wonder why people don't
want to try things, why they just sit in a motionless exp
group in a predictable camp in outdoor zones for 40 levels...

You seem to object to even losing the "book-in-the-face",
despite the fact that casters who can actually *watch*
their group work the mobs WILL LEARN MORE about group
tactics than those who have been blind, staring at a book
for 35 levels.  One of the reasons for level 40 idiot
casters is the fact that you can't "watch and learn" much
while staring at a spellbook.

Better yet, let's just learn how not to engage in ridiculous
hyperbole.

The proposed changes are *vastly* different from your
ridiculous analogy of just giving people end-game levels
and gear at the push of a button.

Try to keep some shred of perspective...
