-You get double damage whenever the MOB isn't rooted and whenever it
isn't trying to attack you.  As long as you have a tank with aggro on
an unrooted MOB, you can back off and plink the MOB for double damage.
 You get double damage on the pull because it wasn't after you when
you hit it.  After that it was, until it ran.  Note that a feared MOB
will still be 'targeting' you.  You get regular damage when fear
kiting in my experience.

-Archery is very low aggro.  So if you get aggro problems in a fight,
you can back off and plink until the tank gets aggro

-Arrows respect the laws of physics (kind of).  They wont hit anything
if your line of sight is obscured, even though you may be able to fire
them off when you can't see the MOB.  Also, if another MOB is in
between you and your target, you will hit that MOB.  This is important
to remember if you have an Enchanter or Bard in the group.

-When rooting and shooting, put "Sit/Stand" as a hotkey and "Range
Attack"
 as a hotkey.  Put them together in your hotbuttons, such as on button
2 and 3.  Root a MOB and get back.  Hit 2-3-2 to quickly stand up,
fire, and sit down.  Repeat when it pops again.  You can med up a bit
while fighting this way...

-Finally remember that dexterity is like strength for archery (as it
appears you already know).  The higher it is, the better.  Boon of the
Garou is your friend, as it adds 100 dexterity.
