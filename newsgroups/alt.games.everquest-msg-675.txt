i think this depends on what continent you are on. on antonica i can solo
yellows easy, in kunark and now, especially with velious i can not. what i
would suggest is kicking it at the gnolls in south karana until somewhere
around 33.  then i think if you move to OT in kunark (assuming your a darkie
in pvp or on a blue server) you can handle cactus and chickens that are
yellow soloing.
