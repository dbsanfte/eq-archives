The vision magnification spells are great.  With them, you can see mobs that
are farther away.  (Whoa...all you people who are about to reply that I'm an
idiot because the vision spells don't move the clipping plane, stop right
now.  Mobs are cut off well before the clipping plane (at least, if you have
the clipping plane at max), and the vision spells DO move the mob cutoff
plane).
