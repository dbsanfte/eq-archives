Even frontstabbing you outdammage a monk once you get double backstab .
Warriors  at 60 get so much incidental dammage that they completely close
the gap for dammage to monks as well .

The only advantage monks get is an easier time acquiring equipment . This
advantage is not quite enough to base a class on though. It is by no means
trivial to get monk equipment either .
