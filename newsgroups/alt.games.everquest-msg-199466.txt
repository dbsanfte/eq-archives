Come over to Xev and group with me and my husband. :)  We missed the whole
"must have KEI" mentality too...just seems like a waste of time to go out
of our way to visit the nexus/PoK when we can already hunt with no
downtime.  That, and we get to strut around acting all tough about how we
don' need no stinkin' KEI.  That's always a plus. :P

When we return to EQ that is...as per my post yesterday, we are now in the
process of ordering parts online...I get to have a bright red computer
case! :D :D I could even have it fricking airbrushed if I want, slap a
picture of Foxeye there on the side... but that's going a little too
far.
