from a thread on graffes detailing changes on test:

"- Players now have the ability to activate/deactivate the tribute benefits 
they've selected (as a whole) whenever they like using a button on the 
Tribute Benefit Window. However, every time the player activates his 
benefits, he will be "Pre-pay" (see above). The ability to change selected 
benefits (downgrade) away from the Tribute Master has been removed.
- When visiting a Tribute Master, the player's benefits will deactivate. 
Players may re-organize their selected Benefit loadout, but will not be 
able to "preview" the benefits (seeing the effect on their character when 
the benefit is selected). Benefit descriptions should give the player a 
good indication of what the Benefit will do when activated.
- The EQ Label that shows the Tribute Benefit Timer will now show green 
when benefits are active, grey when they are not."
