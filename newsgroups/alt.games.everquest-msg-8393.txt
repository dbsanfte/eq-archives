It wasnt in the patch message...
Before, when you re-charmed a creature it would usually go and do what it
was doing before (usually attacking another mob).
The other mob would turn around and continue fighting with it, but now they
just both run towards you. So you have to switch targets from your charmed
creature, to the one you want to attack and command it again. This can be
fairly hard as both creatures are probably close together, making it hard to
target. By the time youve got the fight back underway, the charm usually is
broken.

At least I believe thats what has happened. I havent used Charm kiting for a
few days as Ive been deep in dungeons doing my lambent quests, and not out
in some nice open fields. Check www.EQDiva.com forums to see just how mad
some people have got over it. Not my site but its a nice bard site that
deserves some pimping :)
