I disagree.  The only reason nobody can be classified as "sane" is because
of the proliferation of disorders and such, so that any quirk, pecularity,
or idiosynchrocy falls under the psychologists' umbrella.  Heck, my dyslexia
may be grounds for insanity.  My distaste for authority may be a disorder.
In the end, we've muddies "sanity" and "insanity" so that they're no longer
useful words, in an attempt to ensure any concept of normalicy is stamped
out.
