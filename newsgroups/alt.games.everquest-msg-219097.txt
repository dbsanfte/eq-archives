Ah, but I'm a Paladin :)  So I am quite comfortable grouping with an
Enchanter for CC and a Druid for healing.  As for rez, there doesn't
often seem to be much trouble at all finding rez's after an adventure,
and in the extreme case of a corpse about to rot I do have a 75% rez.
And finally, the only Enchanter who's died while grouped with me in
LDoN was the one who insisted on pulling (my very first mission, a
failure, afterwards when the Cleric and Enchanter were discussing in
groupchat how to improve tactics and win their next one I suggested
"send the Paladin forward to Pacify pull", which was followed by the
sound of crickets chirping).
