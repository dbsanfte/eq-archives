Does it frustrate you to see  someone driving a Mercedes Benz? Every
"Twink" you see is sporting gear that somebody worked very hard to
get. (Usually a higher level character on the same account). Letting
it get you down is a waste of your time and energy.

The only thing you can do is surpress it in options. When you want to
Roleplay seriously surpress /OOC, /SHOUT, /AUCTION.
