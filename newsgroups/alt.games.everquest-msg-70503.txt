Probably true, but that same machine probably doesn't run EQ too good(even
before SOL)...
Yes a little more expensive, but look at the time frame, I'm sure Win98 will
be dropped, just like 95, long before XP will get dropped....And why spend
close to the same money with an OS you know you wouldn't get as much time
out of??

I haven't tried Kunark or Velious yet..... Actually I've only run around
Misty Thicket and Rivervale, at the moment, it was playable, I still think I
need to turn off a couple things....I can give better info on this in a few
more days...

System around p2 350, I would believe that.....I should have added to my
statement, it's not 100% playable(raiding, certain zones, are just not going
to run right on the p2 350, were they before SOL?)

It runs fine, Just sitting there with AIM and ICQ up it uses 87 meg of
memory....And my other machine with a fresh XP install sits at 75-80 meg
memory used....So I'm not sure where the 113 meg memory(or whatever someone
said) numbers came from...Not that, that's really a big deal IMO, unless you
only have 128meg memory....
