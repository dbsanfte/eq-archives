======================================
"Why in the heck would a Ranger, who already has a whole plethora of spells 
that can raise his/her DPS be on a damage table that will, all things being
equal, have him/her outdamage the Poor little warrior, even without the
additional perks of Nukes, DOTs, and ATK Raising spells ?"
======================================

I missed the "be".  Whew.  You forgot the comma before "be" so I skimmed 
over it knowing the verb couldn't be in that clause.  Bad me for being a 
skimmer.  Bad Zymyool, BAD!

Ok, so why is a ranger on a higher damage table than a warrior?  I'll take 
a shot at it...

They have higher DPS potential so that they will be more wanted in groups.  
They can't tank as well as a War / Pal / SK so they need to bring something 
to the table until they get their sweet-ass AAs.

I love rangers, which is good because our guild is ranger heavy.  Every 
ranger in my guild is a master of crowd control with their snares and roots 
and bring a lot to our groups.  I never have to worry about dying in our 
guild groups because the rangers are always keeping a keen eye on the adds 
while they decimate the target with their high DPS ( and Jolt aggro reducer 
).  Within 1 second of a charm breaking in PoN, a ranger is resnaring that 
mob ( which almost always gets them aggro with that high-taunt spell ) and 
I recharm.  I =NEVER= get hit.

Too many people are worried about having what they think is the perfect 
group instead of understanding what all the other classes can bring to the 
table.  They're all chimps and chumps - the chimps just mimic what they are 
told is right and aren't smart enough to understand what is possible, and 
the chumps think they know everything about the game and can't accept that 
something they think is correct could be wrong.  Poor them.  These are the 
people TlalocW is referring to.
