That describes all MMORPG's (well, most).

The differences lie in the focus, and how they achieve it.

It's a while since I played EQ2 and much has changed, but here's one
example.

In EQ1, when you attack a creature, there's nothing special about what's
going on.  Anyone else can come along and attack it as well.  Whoever does
the most damage gets the experience point reward.  You rely on people's
manners to ensure you get the XP for fights you start.

In EQ2, when you attack a creature the encounter becomes 'locked'.  No one
else can hurt the creature until either you or it dies.  The game forces
the situation so that only the person who starts a fight can earn the
reward.

Same thing, fundamentally different feel.
