As I've been doing some quests in EQ1, I realised an implication
I haven't seen mentioned yet regarding EQ2's anti-camp code.

EQ1 mastered the art of the intermittent reward.  (Which, as
psychology has shown, is the best way to train a subject to
repeat a desired behavior, in this case, playing the game. :-)
We kill the same mobs over and over, not just to grind xp, but
because every once in a while a mob drops a nicer-than-average
item.  In the case of a quest, it may be that the mob only
sometimes drops the item needed for the quest.  EQ1 takes it a
step further by often forcing us to kill placeholder mobs over
and over, because once in a while the replacement will be the
quest mob.  And in the really painful cases, the quest mob will
still have the required drop only part of the time.

In my case, I was clearing the stables in City of Mists, because
sometimes a spectral courier would spawn.  The courier drops one
of three scrolls at random, and I needed all three, so in theory
I'd have to kill an average of 5-6 couriers to get all of them.
(I got lucky and got all different scrolls on the first three.)

My question is, has EQ2 moved away from this sort of quest?  If
not, then does the anti-camping xp penalty screw over someone who
is forced to kill the same camp repeatedly to get a quest mob to
spawn?
