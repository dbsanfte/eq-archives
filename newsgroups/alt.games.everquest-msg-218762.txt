Defensive gives warriors an edge in raid situations only.   In most other
situations it's actually inadvisable to use it.   The only permanent
advantage the warrior really has is higher hit points for more efficient
complete heals.

If you believe this is true, then you've never played with a high quality
bard.   If you're on E'ci, group with Menoly sometime.  She regularly keeps
5+ mobs mezed without breaking a sweat, and I've seen her do up to 7 at
once.

For the most part, lockpicking is about as useful as a warrior's defensive
discipline.  You need it for one or two places (usually raid locations), and
you are unlikely to get a group because of it.

If the LDoN chests were upgraded enough, perhaps that will change.

Since incomplete heal was added I can't think of very many situations at all
where a 58+ druid can't replace a cleric seemlessly for healing.  The only
problem with it is many druids dont' play healer enough to get good at the
role, since many groups think that they cannot become good at it.
