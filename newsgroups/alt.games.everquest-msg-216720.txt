I recently started playing again, after 2 years being away. I just
upgraded my main puter to a Athlon 2700, GF FX 5600, .... I also fired
up my wifes old account, (she is not interested in playing right now,
but will have it on her puter), her old rig is an Athlon 900, GF4 MX,
512m memory, etc... I have DSL with static IPs.

I have no problems with LDs on my machine, on my wifes puter there are
LDs all the time, particularly in the Newer Zones. In fact it has been
so bad twice, once in PoK the other time in Shadow Haven, log in run 10ft,
LD, rinse and repeat, that I logged into her account from my puter just
to get her out of the zone. In old world zones and some of the LoY zones
her puter will play for hours, with only an occasional LD. I have not
seen one LD on my machine.

: I really can't keep going LFG for LDoN like this, its one thing
: to LD and log right back in, but when I get 1018 error (you
: already have an active character) for fifteen minutes straight...

With my wifes puter experiencing serial LDs, I had this happen one out of
four time she would LD. The interesting thing was that most of the time
one of my chars was standing over her chars. On the long LDs her char
was there the whole time, with no LD after her name. I could buff her,
initiate trades, even while her puter was rebooting. Very wierd stuff.

Oh ya, I will be upgrading my wifes puter, but there is not really much
point since she is not planning to play till EQ2 comes out.
