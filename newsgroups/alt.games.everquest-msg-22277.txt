Diablo 2 and EQ are very different games and cant really be compared. As youve
just started you have absolutely no idea of the depth of this game. Diablo 2 is
childs play compared to this. I've been playing games (particularly RPG's) for
many years and nothing has come even close to the depth of EQ. Its also the
hardest game ive played.
As for the graphics : well its 2 years old you know? and if you play in full
screen mode i find no problem at all with them. Really you should play for at
least a couple of months and read alot of web sites about it before you offer
an informed opnion.
