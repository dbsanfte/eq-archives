I did try them with the new drivers, after seeing the add on caster's realm,
I remembered I had them.  I hooked them back up, and tried them again, but I
just don't care much for them...

That's just my opinion, other people may try them and love them.  I was
merely offering up my thoughts on the matter...

Peace be with you,
