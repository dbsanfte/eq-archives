Bah!  Please *don't* give us better heals.  I personally loathe having to 
be a healer, and it pains me to think people out there want to encourage 
this behavior.  The DoT, I'm indifferent.  I think I'm happy with Winged 
Death.  If you wanna improve it, lower the mana cost slightly, don't up 
damage.  Better yet, just give us even /better/ DD's!  I'd like that much 
better. I really don't care much about the epic, as I prolly won't be 
getting it anytime soon, and if I did have it I'd just use it to Root/DoT.

Well, actually they didn't say 'the ability to teleport *TO* Luclin' they 
said *on* Luclin.  I wholeheartedly agree that porting to places outside of 
the 'norm' is the perrogitive of the Wizzies.  But once on the moon, I 
think there should be at least a couple druid rings available to port to.  
Hell, I'll go there and help build them if that's what it takes.  (And 
while I'm at it I'll repair that stupid one in GFay too!  I'll just take 
working parts from the BB one...)
