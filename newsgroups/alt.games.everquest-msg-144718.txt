Well, one comment wouldn't make an extremely accurate estimate, no.  But 
it'd still be an estimate. :)

Psst.  I've been to France.  I think you've misread my post.  To clarify:  
My mother was the speaker of loud and slow english, and her rudeness to 
the natives would occasionally result in them not being in such a good 
mood when they'd then talk to me.  

The really annoying part was finding out on the way home that mom 
actually speaks French, but feels she's old so she doesn't have to.  
Arrgh!

}The rude French man I am definitively not thinks it is the same for 
}Americans or other ones. Am I right?

I'm not entirely sure, your grammar is confusing me here.  What is the 
same?  That there are both rude and not-rude people in both our cultures?  
Yes, that's the same.  I'd say 'rude' is the minority party in both 
instances.
