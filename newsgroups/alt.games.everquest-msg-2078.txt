Wow this just happened to me in game I was camping in Kurns one day for 8
hours get tired and log out.  The very next day I log in and there are 3
monks that tell me as soon as I logged in to Kurns --- "GET OUT were camping
the Jester."  So I asked an in game GM what to do since being fairly new to
the game.  This is what he said, I have kept his or her name anonymous.

XXXXX tells you, 'Greetings. guide XXXXX here. If you log out on purpose,
you forfeit your right to a camp '
XXXXX tells you, 'Technically there is no such thing as owning a camp" If
you logged on and wished to share it, he would have had to let you. rotating
placeholders is usually the best option.'
XXXXX tells you, 'It's etiquette that provides for the camping rules, but
not an actual rule. it's something that people go by because they don't like
sharing'
XXXXX tells you, If he wishes to share the camp, and it's got placeholders,
you rotate killing the placeholders until the normal spawn shows up.'
'Whoever kills the normal spawn will usually leave afterwars being that they
got their item. If not then it's simply accepted that the other party gets a
crack at the main critter if it spawns again.'
