He's right though.  I could give less of a damn who you, or Dan, or
anyone else thinks is a legitimate contributor on this or any other
topic.  Tell me that you'll only listen to me if I am a "well known"
poster to this newsgroup and you have just lost any respect I might
otherwise have for you.

As I have said before, frequent posting means zilch.  There are
frequent posters to this newsgroup whose advice I would not take as to
how to get to 4th and Vine.

It isn't just this newsgroup, though.  It's a problem endemic to
Usenet.  Anyone remember Michael Martinez on alt.fan.tolkien?
