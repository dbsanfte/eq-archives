Not much change at all from the current situation, but is he more dangerous
as a martyr or alive. (I heard someone say the solution would be to abduct
him, give him gender reassignment surgery, and then send him back.)

Undoubtedly there is some jealousy on the part of poorer nations and the
terrorists they produce, but I don't think that is the prime motivator for
their actions. I don't believe this media propaganda that they hate
countries that are 'free'.

It's the big three that they hate;

Israeli treatment of the Palestinians
Western policy in relation to Iraq (not Saddam)
Current situation in Saudi Arabia (regarding US troops and the Royal
family.)
