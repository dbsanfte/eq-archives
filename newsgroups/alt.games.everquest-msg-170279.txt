Sorry, but you're espousing MASSIVE overkill here.

I can solo the entire bank, including Bvellos/PH, Drioc and Helssen if I
choose to pull him (usually don't, ice comet hurts), as well as the first 3
see invis giants at the ramp to tormax.

Me and a DC enchanter (and don't really need the DC except on PoZ or harder)
can duo the arena.

Never tried plate cycle at all, but don't really care either.  Also never
been in throne room or temple area hunting (temple is stuff past icewall in
arena, starts with Guardians of Zek, red to 61)
