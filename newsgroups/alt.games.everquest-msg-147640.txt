My 60 enchanter, besides food & drink...
A few stacks of peridots (I'm a guild leader...I end up giving a stack away
here & there to guild clerics)
Key to Howling Stone (haven't gotten there yet to put it on my key ring)
Bat wings (I think).  No fish scales though...I did The Grey quest for EB
necklace...I'm forcing others to, too :) )
EB necklace (see above :p )
Rod of Insidious Glamour?  Or the other one...whichever has right-click
faction buff
Jewelcrafted Resist Kit (most diamond/BD items)

My 53 druid, besides food & drink...
fire beetle eye
keys to Seb/HS
batwings & fish scales

I think that's it.
