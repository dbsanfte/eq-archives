Great Divcide is good hunting, you've got Tizmaks, Kodiaks, and
Drakkal Wolves and Frost Giants all right there.  I'd stay away from
the Wurms except for the fun of beating something that looks like
a dragon, as they are too much effort for the little reward, but
even they are perfectly in your level range in a decent group.  There
is also good hunting in the Coldain and their wolves, but this will
hurt the advantage you have in being able to bind in Kael Drakkar.

While in Great Divide, be sure and pick up your Tooth of the Great
Divide from the Dragon Ring; this will allow druids and wizards to
port you into the zone in the future, eliminating the annoying run in
from the Iceclad Port.

Eastern Wastes also has good hunting in the Ulthorks and Walrus,
as well as the lower level RyGorr and a variety of wildlife; you can
bind in either Thurgadin or Kael Drakkar.

Crystal Caverns is not all that far from either of those bind areas either,
and has a host of 30s range mobs for your hunting pleasure.  Just be
sure to pick up some invis potions, both in the bank for those pesky
CRs, and on your person for getting out the top exit if your invis/camo
source has gone LD for the night.  Nothing worse than being stuck
unable to do anything because someone you relied on has been cut
off by a network glitch.
