Heh.  I knew I'd get caught by the rule as well.  The part I was calling a
subordinate clause is no clause at all, but a compund prepositional phrase.
To rephrase the sentence without all the adjectives and other fluff, it
would read something like this.  "With your slogans and your preference for
slang, you are a shame . . ."  Maybe it's a simple matter of taste, but to
my mind it's a grammatically correct sentence.
