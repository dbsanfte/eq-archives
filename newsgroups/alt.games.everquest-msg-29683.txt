By killing their newbie guards, yep, what a lovely chap you are....

Not really taking the moral high ground, I've killed every guard in the
Commons and in Nro (Nrth Ro Inn Guards are the hardest, they are all but
imune to fear)
so I can hardly talk, just pointing out that they may prefer to have the
safety net of 4 bridge guards for when that Y. Kodiak gets the better of
them. Of course, most people just kill the guards, loot and leave (or wait 6
mins and do it again) at least you SoW'd them  ;�)

CF
may have to pop into Misty and have a "chat" with some Deputies, then hand
out some Black Alloy armour ;�P
