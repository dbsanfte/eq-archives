LDoN dungeons are tuned to the average level of your group... but its 
done in a "chunky" fashion; it goes up every 5 levels.

Thus your average level might get you a level 50 dungeon, then just one 
person getting one more level could push you over the edge into the 
level 55 dungeon, which as you can imagine is a large jump in difficulty.

Your group is really low on DPS, two paladins and two druids?  Thats not 
to say its not possible to succede with such a group, but its not 
optimal, so if you find yourself facing a mission 5 levels harder than 
you are used to that could really end up making a difference.
