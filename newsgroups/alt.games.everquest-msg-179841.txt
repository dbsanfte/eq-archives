LOL... and you fell for it?

Listen, there are PLENTY of  ways to rip people off in this world.. that is
assured.   But to banter on about a product you have NO idea about... is
just as absurd and a likely sign of one's inability to 'read beyond the
first page'.

We are just offering those who want to give the informaiton a whirl, the
opportunity to do so.  Maybe some of it IS available somewhere else.. we
didn't invent EverQuest, nor do we want to stop the flow of information on
the internet.  But our guides are written by PLAYERS, and yes, you can reach
us in-game (as long as we're not busy.. and don't ask us to power-level...
we WILL  laugh at you).  We don't hold the secrets of Norrath in our hot
little hands.. but we ARE willing to provide useful, pertinent and
EXPERIENCED information in a documented form... to help share the our ofteh,
hard-learned experience.  And yes, experience is not cheap.

And the next time you look at a MOB and decide.. hey, it looks like ANY of
the rest of the MOBs I've seen around here.. look again, friend.  THAT sort
of thinking gets groups and you splattered all over the camp. =)

"Data is not information, and expereince is not wisdom.. but they are merely
PART of the equation..."

"Snare is a tool, like any other.  Sometimes it is useful...sometimes it is
harmful to you.  Learn this.
