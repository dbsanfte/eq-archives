Frankly, as a tailoring expert who has messed with many of the
tradeskills, my first advice to you would be NOT to get into them,
unless you're intending to eventually do some of the quests that
require them, or you want something to do for a change of pace from
hack and slash.

Tradeskills are NOT necessary to play the game, and they've very time
and platinum consuming.

That said, tailoring is an easy one to start, but one of the hardest
to truly master.
