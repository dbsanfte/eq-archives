Hmm. Perhaps the guild I'm in is just very small, very inactive, or
both. I don't usually see more than one or two people in GH.
Stupid instancing zones... ;)

I just started exploring TSS zones this week, and I do have to say it
really has been all it's been hyped up to be and a piece of toast.
While the Santa GM trend still grates on me, at this point there's no
going back. The quests, regardless of reward, have been terribly fun -
I've done a couple of class-inapropriate quests now just because it
fit my character. The zones all beautiful, the ground spawn graphics
wonderfully rich and varied (no more non-descript brown baggies :D ),
and even though some would say it's a minor thing I was really tickled
when I was burned while walking on a camp fire, into a furnace, or
anything else with fire.

There were some irritating but understandable invisible saftey rails
in place, but on the whole I've really liked what I've seen.  And
while I've not seen anyone in my level range yet (but also haven't
ventured to the level appropriate zones yet - still working on
catching up on the various story arc/advancement quests) I have seen
several people in each zone.

That there were a chance the old world content would ever be upgraded
to this level. Don't get me wrong, I've really liked the old world
zone revamps, but so far they've been largely graphical.  Without a
content revamp to go along with it, there's not much to draw people to
it.  And that's really my biggest gripe with TSS - it's too good and
too self-enclosed.  It really is its own full game within the game.

I'll close out saying I'm excited at the prospect of the upcoming
expansion, genuinely excited!
