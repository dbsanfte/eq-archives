You mean the fact that you'd violate a contract you signed (thus,
being blatantly dishonest and potentially violating contract laws)
doesn't make you a bad person? You're selling something that doesn't
belong to you (an MMO account represents space -RENTED- on the
servers, not property that you own. Think of it as a club membership).
