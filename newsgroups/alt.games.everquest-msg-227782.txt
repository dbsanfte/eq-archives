Inspect
Sense Traps
Disarm Traps
Pick Lock
Open


Sounds simple...now the tricky bits....

1) If you  can not tell whether  a chest is trapped or not, leave it alone
2) If you sense a trap, but can't disarm it, leave it alone
3) If you get this far, pick the lock, if you can't pick the lock, leave it
alone
4) If the lock is picked, open it.  I have found some chests that will not
open at this point.. I believe that they won't until a particular mob is
killed.


Good luck
