Not practically.
You'd run out of muffins.
You'd be forced to turn off the drop confirmation box if you were dropping
muffins/items.

Coins drop off of mobs much more frequently than any other item; coins
could/can be dropped with out turning off the drop item confirmation box.
No matter how long I was playing/pulling I could always count on having a
few copper or silver to drop at each confusing corner.
