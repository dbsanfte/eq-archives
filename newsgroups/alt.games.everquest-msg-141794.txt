The filter is there to catch the occasional "oops!"  You're ALLOWED to use
profanity in privacy with friends or others who don't mind it.  But
occasionally one will be sent to the wrong channel (boy is THAT
embarrassing!).

Besides, it's just too freakin' easy to get around the filter for those
children who insist on using "adult" language inappropriately.  Can't filter
that.
