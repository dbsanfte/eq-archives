I don't know if this has been asked before, but what suggestions would
you have for running EQ on a laptop? I have a Toshiba Satellite. 128
megs of ram with an ATI rage something or other, Celeron 550. I tried
the tutorial and it runs okay, but I'm looking for suggestions to
improve my typical laptop screen. Any help would be appreciated.
