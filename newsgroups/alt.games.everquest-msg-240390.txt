< snipped it all >

As this thread has droned on (ya gotta admit, it'd getting to be one of 
those), I can see where I may have confused the issue of copyright law with 
the EULA with regard to EverQuest. I think actual copyright law is probably 
a gray area somewhere between what we are each claiming, if we were to know 
for sure.

Where EQ is concerned, selling items/plat in RL for real money is certainly 
against the EULA. Whereas it may not be inforceable by law (though I guess 
some computer game exploiters over in Asia were recently ruled against in a 
court of law), they are certainly well within their rights to ban your 
account.

Additionally, the aforementioned act *is* different that selling items to 
another player for in-game plat.
