Afraid I am with Caeli on that one.  I have used both, and, quite frankly, I
still prefer Windoze to Mac.  Having used both for work, doing code
development, I found that both were equally prone to crashing, and that the
Mac did far more to force me to use that stupid mouse than Windoze did.  I
am not saying I am a Windoze fan by any means, but, for my uses, it is
superior.
