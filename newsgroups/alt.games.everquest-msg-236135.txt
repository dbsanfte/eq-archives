Hi, I'm a 64 Cleric on Drinal, gonna ding 65 in the next week or two and
then will start working on AA's.
Any recommendations which to go for first?  Already have run2 and will
upgrade to 3 shortly....  But where to from there?
I'd like to work my way to MGB as I can see that as being very helpful /
handy and I already have my HoV spell ready to mem....

Thanks in advance,

Tuvarilo 64 Cleric - Drinal
Officer of Alliance of Heroes.
