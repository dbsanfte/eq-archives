Yes.

No.

This is easily tested. Get an ungrouped warrior and cleric, and a mob with
fewer hp than the warrior. Let's say the warrior has 2k hp and the mob has
1500 hp. Have the warrior fight the mob, making sure to take at least 1600
damage. Have the cleric CHeal the warrior before the mob dies. Who do you
suppose gets the xp? The warrior who has done 1500 damage, or the cleric who
has healed 1600 damage to the mob's enemy?
