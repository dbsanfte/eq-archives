You know after looking more and more I was coming to the same
conclusion but I was also certain I had seen the mana bar drop a
percentage point or two when I had been interrupted in one way or
another.  Now I'm starting to wonder if it has anything to do with
differences in how much mana the server thinks you have versus how much
mana your UI shows or something like that.

I have noticed after being rezzed or getting very low on mana that
sometimes, having just enough mana to cast a spell is still not enough
to cast that spell.  It I wait until I tic over and just have enough to
cast the spell, the game will tell me that I do not have enough mana
and as if to add insult to injury, will charge me some mana for the
effort.  I have found that in general, I must wait another tic (two
tics where mana shows high enough to cast) before it won't effectively
make me "fizzle".  This has nothing to do with mana pres, BTW.  I mean
800 mana for an 800 base-cost spell, 500 mana for a 500 mana spell,
etc..

I have always assumed that this happens because even though I show,
say, 500 mana I don't actually have 500 mana.  What I see and what the
server sees are slightly different...is my theory.  Furthermore, it's
my theory that when you try to cast and it says you don't have enough
mana (even though the UI says yo do) that this forces the server to
update your UI or something like that and the mana loss from the failed
cast is actually just your UI being corrected.  This is really just my
guesswork and I never bothered to investigate much because it's such a
minor issue.

Anyway, just my wild-assed theories about a minor glitch in the
system...
