It does seem to be intermittant. I haven't had the problem for a few
days now. Early last week I had it three times in a row before giving
up on several days. In my experience jiggling the mouse has no effect,
reloading mouse drivers has no effect and using mouse over Enter on
previous screens has no effect. By no effect I mean it doesn't change
the odds of having a stuck mouse.
