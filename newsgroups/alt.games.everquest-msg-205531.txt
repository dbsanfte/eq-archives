That's precisely what I was getting at with the ideas of D&D concepts.
 Sure, the "high fantasy" setting goes back to Tolkien and English,
Teutonic and Norse sagas before him.  But many of the game mechanics -
such as levels, hit point and "healers can't use pointy weapons" -
have survived virtually unchanged from D&D.  (The first game to really
popularize them)

Given that many other RPG's have tried to improve on the AD&D
mechanics over the years I find it astounding that so little has
changed in a quarter century.  The invention of mana of course being a
significant exception.

I just wonder if RPG 25 years from now will still have "armor class",
clerics who can't use pointy weapons and thief/rogues who get
increasing damage multipliers for backstabs as they go up in "level".
