I think by far the coolest thing for casters would be to allow you to have
either more than one copy of a spell memmed or "shortcuts" to spells it
would be wayy cool to have like a "soloing" page, a "raid" page, a "power
leveling" page, a normal "group" page" with like sow SLN or whatever else
clerics chanters shamans and druids and other casters use. That would make
things soo much easier imho
