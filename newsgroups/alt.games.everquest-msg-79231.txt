When I worked on the 3rd Shawl quest I got my baking up with bat wings from
EC (near WC) and fresh fish from EFP.

Now my gnome is hooked on that food. :)  But the running around is annoying.

Do you know of a single zone where both are sold?  And barring that, do you
know of 2 closer vendors?  They don't have to be geographically closer...I
do have a pet druid and wizard to port me around.  If bat wings were sold in
Steamfont and fresh fish in Toxx, that's just fine with me.
