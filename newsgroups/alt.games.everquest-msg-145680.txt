All the warriors and other plate wearers were dead and their corpses
somewhere fun after a mob had managed to gate on us.

3-4 would be many clerics for my guild. We've done HoT with one
cleric.

*I* have tanked HoT stuff. For 2.8 seconds :)

>Hopefully i can carry it further someday and tank doze too :)

I'd settle for being around when we kill him :)
