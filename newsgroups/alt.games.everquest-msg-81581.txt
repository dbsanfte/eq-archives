If you've been in icewell you'll know the pathfinding there makes
original Mistmoore look like a work of genius. You can't fight Dain in
his room, so most people I know pull him down the well. But GETTING
him down there, alone, without accidently depopping him is something
that takes a lot of practice.

My time in Dain fights has been as a druid so I'm not usually called
on to pull him, though. :-)
