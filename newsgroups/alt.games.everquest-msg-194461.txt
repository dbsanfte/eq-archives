OK.

So, my Vah Shir Beastmaster is about halfway through 8th level, and is
finding that almost anything which will give him decent XP also kicks
his furry butt, or, at the least, requires a lot of sitting down and
healing. Obviously, it is time to seek out a group. I am Firona Vie,
so I don't want to wander around yell "Bst 8 sks grp" or the like. I
also can only commit to a few hours (2-3) of playtime, and that with
some warning, so I don't want to join a guild which requires 48 hours
on-keyboard duty to wait for some rare spawn to drop the Amulet of
Foozle. I'm looking, ideally, for role-players (hence my choice of
server) who are willing to deal with a long-time RPer (since 1978) but
relatively new EQer (i.e, if you tell me "RT the GV b4 it QSE on
JKQ!", I will NOT know what you're talking about.)

What is the best way to find a group of like-leveled characters for a
few hours of monster-killing?

(As a side note, if anyone knows, how good a tailor do you need to be
to make the second set of Beastmaster gloves, the ones which require
the hopper claws? I lost one set of tediously-gathered ingredients
already and don't wish to lose another...)
