Clipping & Targetting both occur client side, since they are highly 
intrinsic to geometry rendering.

After some consideration, I would suspect that 'target is too far away' 
message can orginate both locally and on the server. In other words, if 
the client deduces that the mob is too far away to hit, the server 
doesn't bother to check. (If client reports that it is within range, 
then the server might(should!) validate the condition to prevent 
cheating)... at least that is how I might design it.

Further I suspect the client side check is based on geometry 
computations, while the server side check would almost certainly be a 
looser basic distance or bounding box check.

Ergo... geometry/rendering problems that relocate the mob model would 
cause 'target too far away' messages on a single client, without its 
serverside position being affected to other players.
