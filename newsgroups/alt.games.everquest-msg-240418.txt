Hmm - funky line wrap in my reader - no matter.

Corpse retrieval 101 :)

First, make a hotkey with /loc on it

/hot Location /loc

will do it, and put it in your hotkey bank.

Now, anytime you start getting hit (in a fight, or
just get jumped) hit it.

the numbers are like so:
First number is north south, positive is north
Second number is east west, positive is west

So, if you died at 1000, -2000 and you are currently
at 0, 0 you would run east-northeast to get to your
body.

That, however, doesn't help you right now - 

First thing buy a Chipped Bone Rod

Now, run to the zone you died in, right click
the rod and you will be spun to point at your corpse.

I can't remember exactly where to get these anymore,
but they are sold in Freeport.

Second, you can ask a level 4+ bard, and necro or
a level 9+ shadowknight to help find it, they have
spells/songs that will point them to your corpse.
