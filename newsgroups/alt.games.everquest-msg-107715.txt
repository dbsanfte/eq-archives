That is correct sir.

Remember, humans are, in general, greedy selfish bastards, at least I'm
willing to admit it.  If I have a choice between something that helps me, or
something that helps some dimwit I've never met before, I'll choose me over
the dimwit. (not pointing fingers at anyone in particular, just a general
example)  Anyone who says differently is either intrinsically stupid,
intrinsically altruistic,or a liar.
