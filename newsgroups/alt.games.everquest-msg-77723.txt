    Except maybe human.  Lowest int, I believe, though
well rounded in the other stats.  No night vision, but
that becomes a non issue when you get Deadeye at level
8.  Best faction, probably, of all necros.  And, IMVHO,
the best looking necros, at least with the luclin graphics.
One unexpected (to me) drawback is that, being human,
I'm having trouble getting into an evil guild...seems
humans is a rare necro choice, and there's this anti-
lighty sentiment that seems to prevail. 
   It adds to challenge.  I'm having a blast with mine.
But if you want a deep mana pool, this is not the way
to go.
