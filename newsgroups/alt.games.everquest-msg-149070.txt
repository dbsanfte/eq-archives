Well my point is you're ranting about someone not wanting to pay you
500pp for sitting there casting something for 20 minutes. If you don't
wanna do it then don't do it. It sounds more and more like you said
500pp just to get him to go away. Even if he has that much to just
blow there are more valuable things he could spend it on, just because
the spell it higher than a level 12 viscous mana spell doesn't make it
worth hoards of pp just to cast a few times. I mean I don't blame him
because I see his side of the damn thing even the way you described it
and you're so defensive because I disagree with you and you're not
willing to see his side of it. So what was the point of posting this
in the first place? To get pissed when other people don't agree with
you? Seems kind of dumb...
