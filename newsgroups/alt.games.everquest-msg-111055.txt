I would recommend getting your blue behind to Odus, and sticking it in the
warrens for 10-12levels or so.
When you need bone chips there are literally more skellies than you can kill
in the newbie zone (which is usually empty as a grave), you will be able to
use the heritic necro guild within 2 levels of killing every kobold you
find, and loot in that place is awesome for low levels.
The one important thing is to stock up on bags before going, you'll need em.
