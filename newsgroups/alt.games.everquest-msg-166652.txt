So, I give my point of view, I'm "trying to force an argument".
Someone else does it, and they're just fine. Wanna see where someone
is REALLY trying to force an argument? Read your own fucking posts.

Tell me where I said that I didn't have a problem with ebaying, and
I'll concede that he agreed with me. Tell me where I tried to put
words into his mouth, and I'll concede that as well. Quit fucking
reading between the lines if you can't even comprehend the lines
themselves.

On second thought, forget it. Go bait someone else, troll. I'm tired
of fighting with people who take random swings at me for no reason.
