I am not saying it is 100% accurate.  But it is possible to find articles
that support your point of view no matter what that point of view may be.
But I have to add this much.  I saw on CNN (owned by Time-Warner, itself now
under AOL, one of Microsoft's fiercest rivals) a bit on his donating the
billions to help inner city kids get access to computers.  I am not saying
Microsoft donated out of its corporate coffers; as I understood the segment,
Gates paid it out of his own pocket.
