Its pretty simple really.
Multi-questing is whenever a quest requires 2 or more items to be handed
in to receive a reward and the items are NO DROP. The person that is to
receive the quest reward item must be the last person to hand in his
piece(s).

-or-

If there is a triggered spawn of a mob/NPC that must be killed. Once the mob is
killed anyone can loot the item(s). So person 'A' hands in the NO DROP trigger
item to spawn a mob, then everyone kills it and person 'B' loots the dead mob
for the next item or reward item.

MQing will not work on quests that use NO DROP combine quest containers.
There is no way for 2 or more people to put things into the container.
