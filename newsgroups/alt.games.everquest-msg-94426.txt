Er, you may be a programmer, but you have no idea of what you are talking 
about. The EQ executable is just a little over 1mb. What takes up 512MB 
of RAM is the sheer amount of models and textures, and unfortunately the 
only way to reduce the required memory is either to swap in from hard 
disk, which was deemed unacceptable, or to have fewer models and 
textures. That's actually on the options, and makes performance 
acceptable with less memory.
