I found this discussion... which doesn't seem to resolve anything:

====================================================================
Brannoc - *Chanaluss* for several years, the magician fire pet after 
level 50 was deemed useless by the magician community. over these years, 
small changes have occured, but the pet still retains its main issues, 
and as a result, no magician would dare use it. is there any hope left 
for this spell arc?
Prathun - Feedback from the mage community seems to suggest that the 
fire pet is, well, worthless.
Prathun - I'm interested in changing the pet's abilities so that it does 
have a niche in the mage's arsenal, either by increasing the 
effectiveness of it's spell casting, or giving it more mana 
regeneration, or higher survivability, or something else entirely.
===================================================================
In particular, note "or giving it more mana regeneration".  This guy 
apparantly has NO CLUE what we're talking about, which is that the 
spells the pet casts are a disaster.  More mana regen?  How about taking 
all its mana away so it stops casting the damn things!

In the most recent patch message, they said they were, indeed, "fixing" 
the fire pet mana regen, by which they meant giving it more.  Someone in 
reply suggested, though, that the spell list had already been fixed, so 
it wasn't a disaster after all.  I'm still trying to pin down what that 
means.
