I did mine the other direction, Halas to Oasis for my Serpent Sight 
spell.  The other one was my first boat trip from BBM to Freeport with my 
dwarf Paladin.  That was when I found out that a dwarf has trouble 
getting back on the boat in Freeport, ended up dumping me in the water 
between the boat and the dock.  I didn't yet know how to swim in the 
game, so I drowned under the freeport dock.  I took some time to learn 
the game mechanics of swimming, took the boat back across and looted my 
level 4 or so corpse before it poofed.
