Hear me oh Verant and listen to my plea.  Add not to the number of
spells memorized at a given time.  Let neither the number be 27 nor 63,
but hold true to that which works and let it remain 8.  To give more
slots to casters would be to open the floodgates and in the end the
result would be warriors with 6 arms and three legs.  Screweth not with
that which works.

Oh, sorry, you only wanted to hear from folks that agreed with you. 
Nevermind.
