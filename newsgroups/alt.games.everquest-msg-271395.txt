I've never played City of Heroes, but I read something in a review a
while back about heroes being able to have "sidekicks", lower level
players who actually were more powerful as long as they were with
their mentor.  I think the idea was exactly this sort of "take a
student under your wing" approach.  I'm not sure whether this is
actually something that is in CoH, or whether this is just something
that they were contemplating implementing... maybe someone who has
played CoH can comment?
