Incorrect.  My Ogre Warrior with 211 STR got drunk.  He went up to 224 STR 
with an alcohol tolerance of 60 or so.  It's still quite useless, though; 
just fun.  I vaguely recall it increases STA too, but I'd have to double 
check (or am I mixing it up with Berserker style buffs?).

mitigating argument. Atrocity never balances or rectifies the past.
Atrocity merely arms the future for more atrocity. It is self-
perpetuating upon itself--a barbarous form of incest. Whoever commits
atrocity also commits those future atrocities thus bred." Frank Herbert
