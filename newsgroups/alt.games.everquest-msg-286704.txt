But thats the key issue, all the others are of lesser importance; as 
currently arrange, there are two sorts of Can't Log In, which can be 
distinguished from each other simply by looking at the status page, but 
which as you note, are irrelevant, and there is Can Log in, which Cannot 
be distinguished from the second form of Can't Log In.

Can't Log In: Servers Down
looks different from
Can't Log In: Servers Up but testers monkeying around

Can't Log In: Servers Down
looks different from
Can Log In: Server's Up and the game is playable, but you're getting 
congestion preventing you from logging in

Can't Log In: Servers Up but testers monkeying around
LOOKS THE SAME AS
Can Log In: Server's Up and the game is playable, but you're getting 
congestion preventing you from logging in

Now since you'll rarely go directly from the first set to the third set, 
the second set is of small interest.

The third set, however, is very common, and it doesn't address the core 
issue thats important to me... and to you.

If the announcement page is normally updated in a timely manner, as it 
was yesterday, then that information is available after all.  Its being 
done in a sloppy halfassed fashion, but since its associated with SOE 
patch policies, thats par for the course.
