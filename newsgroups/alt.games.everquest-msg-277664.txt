Note:  I agro'd Fabled Gore this past weekend coming in from the DL
druid port.  I stopped in the tunnel for a bit and she teleported into there
and smacked me a bit.  So I run off into the hidden vally and she teleports
into there and agro's on someone else going thru the tunnel.  He runs off
and gets away because she's beating against the hidden valley wall prior
to teleporting.  I then bolt thru the tunnel and she agros on me again
but having Eagle outran her to KC to begin a calm day of Fabled farming.
