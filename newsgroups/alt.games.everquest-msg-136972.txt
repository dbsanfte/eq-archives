I'm not saying the MT was right in switching. What I'm saying is why 
couldn't the enchanter adapt? Ok so the MT switched. He thought he was 
doing the right thing.. why does it have to be the enchanters way or the 
highway? I didn't mind dying (we had a cleric.. no big deal). What 
pissed me off the most was the incessant WHINING by the enchanter.
