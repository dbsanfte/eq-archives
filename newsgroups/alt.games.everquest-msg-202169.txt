Apparently on Saturday, in my hurry to go to dinner with my
girlfriend, I didn't get camped out after a romp in Nadox.
As a result I was sitting in aggro range of 2 mobs when my
veil of elements faded - and despite being green they killed
me.  

So, an unrezzed death - not too bad, except I'm bound in
WW next to ToV for raids.  So, there is my naked mage in
WW on his bind point when something that's aggro to him
gets trained there - if it weren't for a friend noticing
something was wrong and getting me world booted I might
be a HELL of a lot lower than 62 now.  5 full yellow of
xp gone, and no corpses to rez  :(  I figure that must 
have been a good 40 deaths.

OTOH, logged in today and realized none of my wizard or
druid friends who might have picked me up were on and made
a naked trek from WW all the way back to the Gulf of Gunthak
:)  The trip through SG was quite tense, but actually 
quite fun - I'm unfamiliar with anything but the 2 zones
for SG as I am usually succored across and TP'd out of WW.

Oh, and this time I waited for the /camp countdown to finish
before I walked away from my comp :-P
