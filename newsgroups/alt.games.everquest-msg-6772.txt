That whole "spin intantly" thing is a real PITA, too.  Hence the failure of my
theory that, at level 11, I would be able to solo Proon with my monk if I was
sow'd and kept running between his legs, spinning, punch/kicking him from behind,
run back through legs, rinse/repeat.  I think I lasted more than five second on
that one because he somehow missed me on the first swing.
  My second theory of how I was going to solo him in my teens I blame sqaurely on
stuff I read in this group and an excessive amount of Jack Daniels.  I've been
aching to kill that bastard since the first time I ran into him.  One of these
days I'm coming back with one big, mean, ugly ass, high level troll warrior, and
then it's going to be "Proon Sandwiches for all my friends!"
