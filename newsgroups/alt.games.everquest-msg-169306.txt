Hail, friends. Between the frenzy of battles I like to sit my arse down and
focus me wee Barbarian brain on improving me skills. Some gnome barely big
enough to carry his staff once told me to go jump in the lake and so I did,
an ah found that by doin so, I kin improve me skills by just swimmin around
like a feesh. Figger that! Anyway, I have some questions:

1) Will my skill improve by swimming on the surface, or do I need to be
suckin it in and holdin me breath under the surface? When me skills do
improve, what improves? Speed? Endurance? Both, neither?

2) I 'ave learned to heal me own wounds. What does it mean when Bind Wound
improves? Does it decrease the time it takes to bind a wound, or does the
amount healed go up?

3) I was grouped with a strange pointy-eared lady what kept talking
gibberish. She told me to learn Elvish and I asked her if I looked like a
Bard, but anyway, how does one improve Language skills? Is it from the
talking or from the listening?

Thanks friends, ah'll see ya on the battlefields!
