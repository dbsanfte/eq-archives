I had this problem, although it would eventually lead to disconnect;
essentially packets still arrived, I could see tells and the group
talking, but they couldnt hear me. I'd even hear them saying I was
linkdead, which I clearly wasnt as I was still receiving packets.

Eventually I tracked it down to my router, replaced that with a new
one, and all is now fine. I suspect the problem was the NAT tables
on the router getting out of sync so my outbound packets were no
longer matching up with the connection as EQ thought they should,
or some such.

Try replacing whatever connectivity you're using; if you're on
broadband, test it with a modem. If you're using connection sharing,
use wingate. If wingate, connection sharing. if an external router,
a different brand, and so on.
