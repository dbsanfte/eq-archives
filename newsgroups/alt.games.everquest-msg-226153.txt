Actually the use is *entirely* dependant on the pronunciation (in the 
authors intent no less).


Correctly, it is 'We need a shadowknight' or 'We need an
> SK'. 

Provided you intend SK to read as 'ess-kay'. If you intend a full 
readout then its correct to put 'a SK'. (a similiar example is URL where 
its common to pronounce both as 'you-are-ell' and 'earl' making both a 
URL and an URL correct.

Correctly classifying whether SK *should* be read out as letters or 
expanded to shadowknight is a separate debate. There are no hard rules 
here, but *most* two letter abbreviations are read out 'letters', 
provided that they are fully capitalized, have no periods, and do not 
refer to proper nouns (e.g. MN,PQ), nor measurements (e.g. mm,km).

This puts it in the same class as TV (television), PC (personal 
computer), RF (radio frequency), CD (compact disc), and LP (long play 
[record]), and even EQ (everquest) in my opinion.

Though even here there are probably exceptions...I'd bet at least half 
of you say 'em-queue' for (MQ) while the other half say multi-quest... 
but that's another EQism, so it doesn't really count...
