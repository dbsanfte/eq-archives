Thats bullshit man.  CoD quest I guess isnt that hard.  At least the
drops he wants are all in PoD.

HoH one is hard though.  Well, not hard, tedious.  3 rares from 3
uncommon spawns across 3 zones.  And then you have to collect souls from
PoJ, and that part was broken up until last week.  To date a handful of
people across all servers have solved this quest and you are trying to
tell me that I could have me and 5 friends in HoH already?  Ridiculous.
