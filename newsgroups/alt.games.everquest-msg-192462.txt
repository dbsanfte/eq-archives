It is? First I've heard about any increased crashing/LD in the Bazaar
since last patch.

Bandwidth is excessive in the Bazaar. Spending extended time there
increases your normal chances of going LD dramaticly. OOC/auc/shout
spam create more of a burdon. Then there are those @#$% bards that
decide to practice brass with their AOE damage song while sitting afk
overnight in the bazaar - yes, that does cause people in the radius to
be more likely to go LD.

So, honestly, I doubt the issue has anything to do with the patch...

And I was supposed to be able to tell that from a gender-neutral
posting handle?
