    And not likely in the near future, either. Euro player, has odd sleep
patterns just to raid with us, group dependent class = not many AA points.

    Virtue? What, for Fennin Ro? Paladins use Virtue in our guild, that's
it. Everyone else gets MGB Kazad's. With eight clerics on a raid, assuming
you aren't chain-wiping that's two people that do MGB Kazad's, a few people
that do rebuffs for the odd death, and a few clerics that don't even need to
carry peridots. BoR is used by only a few non-clerics in the guild, mostly
druids, as nukers soon find out that they can already die if they blast at
max speed. They don't need 10% haste to die even faster. Elixir? Do you have
a healing channel, are you ever in it? SR, SR, SR, SR, SR, SR, SR. SR works
with the healing focus, SE doesn't. SR crits, SE doesn't. SR works with
Adept, SE doesn't. It's almost to the point where I don't see people casting
CH except on bosses - it's all SR.

    That's why I said Reinforcement isn't as useful at what a cleric does
most of the time. Fast heals are 90% of a cleric's work nowadays, and for
those you want SCM, HA/AHA, HG/AHG. As a secondary consideration for fast
heal aggro you want ND, CA/LR, CS/ID. As a general consideration you want
MC. Your remaining 10% is specialty work - curing against AoE damage,
buffing the raid, casting DI, etc. That's where you use abilities like RC,
MGB, SCR/SCRM, UD, etc.

    The LoY spell cures curses, too? Not that you see curses in CoD, but
there are places where you will run into them, like Xegony, the Rathe
encounter, and Fennin Ro (if they ever fix his AoE!)

    RC 3 doesn't always clear the tree snare, either. Wish I knew what was
up with that.

    With a Monk or a Ranger I would have split the XP and had to roll on the
Mithril arms. Giants don't repop for a long time, remember? I was just
surprised they were up, especially because the front giants between Tranix
and the Stone Spider room (oh, killed him too!) were down. Guess someone had
started clearing, got wiped, called it a day. Works for me - the arms have
paid for a lot of Jord Meat and Vann Toes!
