Jeezus man!  If you need someone to tell you what the intent is when
you sell national military secrets to a hostile power....

Not my quote, it's from the most respected foreign diplomat this
country has seen in over a century.

Your sad.  I don't accept anything anyone says without consideration.
The difference is I may accept it for reasons that are not what they
purport.  Sadaam is a perfect case.  Did Mr. Bush say he had WMD's?
Yes.  Do I believe it?  Yes, or at least that he had the capability.
Do I care if it was Mr. Bush that said it?  No.  Would I have agreed
with taking out Sadaam if Mr. Clinton were still in office?  Yes.
Would it matter to me if the original reasons for taking him out were
false?  No.
Their reasons may be wrong, but my agreement with their goal is
unchanged.

Some countries yes.  Most countries no.  Most hate us because they
want what we have.  Daily examples are not hard to find, just look
around and apply it to a global level.

No we could not.  Why invade Italy, or Spain, or Germany?  We
wouldn't.  The populace is more or less happy with their government
and the government is not expansionary.   Then there are the rest...

And how is this treasonous?  Lying yes, purjory if under oath, treason
no.  Do you knwo the difference?  It appears not.
