    Let me cheer you up a little, then: my buddy's cleric went 50 to 54 in a
week. He played as often as possible, and was always LFGing in Velk's as
opposed to having a group ready-made. My rogue went 45 to 47 this weekend,
with 48 coming tonight (one bub off) - again, LFGing in Sol B. If you put in
the time, it will fly by. So good luck and go get those disciplines!
