I personally don't have any desire to be a PvP player, but I do have a
few questions for you folks that play PvP:

What attracted you to make you decide to become a PvP player?  

What strategies do you use that are different than what a non-PvP'er
uses, besides the ones that I know of about banking most of your money
and keeping your loot in backpacks?

I would think that there would be a lot fewer twinks on a PvP server,
seeing that a twinked player could easily lose their stuff; is this
true, or are there about the same number of twinks as there are on
non-PvP servers?

What is a "Care Bear server" (I've heard that phrase used often)?

When I /con a player on my non-PvP server, I get the "indifferent"
message; it would make sense to me that /conning a PvP player would
get the "scowling/ready to attack" message; is this correct?

Is it true that PvP players actually have better game manners than
non-PvP players (the theory being that a PvP'er who goes around
KS'ing, ninja-looting, etc. risks getting their head handed to them on
a platter so therefore is less likely to engage in that type of
behavior)?

How does an Iksar become a PvP player since there is no POD in Cabilis
(at least none that I know of)?  I'm guessing they have to do faction
work and then go to another city and then turn in their book to the
POD there?

What are the better races/classes for playing PvP?  Worse
races/classes?

Do you PvP players have other non-PvP characters that you also play or
do you exclusively play PvP?  What things do you like in PvP that you
miss in non-PvP playing?  What things do you dislike in PvP that you
don't have to deal with in non-PvP (besides the obvious)?

Thanks in advance.
