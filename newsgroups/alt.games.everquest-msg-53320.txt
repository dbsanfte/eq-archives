Hello all,

I decided to start all over with new chars.  It seems I am still way to new
to this game on EQ.  What I am looking for is some good advice.  I know in
this game it takes patents and time to grow your chars.  What I am asking am
I doing something wrong.  The only char I am not scrapping is my 15th level
druid halfling.  The problem with her is I do not know where to hunt and
when I do get a group everyone leaves (not saing its my fault).  What I am
interested on a good fighter type char that does not have to depend on
magics.  What should I look in.  Oh another question (knowing I am sounding
ingorant) how are people jumping levels like they are nothing?  Is there a
trick to this all.  If I can get some help from your grand knowlege people.

Thank you

Eric
