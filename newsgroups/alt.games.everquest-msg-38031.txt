"Topic:   Statement about the Seattle Times article

We have seen the article in the Seattle Times regarding an incident
almost a year ago in which someone apparently got a hold of one or
more superuser accounts for a short period of time. We want to assure
our customers that at no time was any consumer billing information
compromised. No one should be worried that their credit card
information got outï¿½ IT DID NOT. In addition, some time ago we added
additional layers of security in an effort to prevent this from
happening again. Beyond this, it is inappropriate for us to comment in
light of the ongoing investigation.
