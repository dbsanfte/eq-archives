Hi Everyone,

I haven't played in about 7 or 8 months and have decided to jump in again.
I quit because of constraints in my own life, that prevented me fro doing
any serious playing.

My main is a 16 WE Ranger, and I have 9 Barb Shammy, and 8 Isk Monk.

Any major changes (They were just doing the "class balancing" when I quit)
in recent times.  I am wanting to get back up to snuff before they release
the Luclin expansion.

Thanks in advance and cant wait to get started (I'll probly start a new
character to relearn some skills)

M.
