Most useless active spell line is the Enchanter Harmony style spells, called
Lull. 100% useless. Before they were nerfed they worked well and unlike
Harmony could be used indoors. The AE version is the biggest laugh. I got
the spell at lvl 51. Never tried it until I was around LVL 55 and was
wandering past derv came in NRO. I decided to test it for a laugh. Every
single on of those greener than green mobs resisted it and came running.

Utterly useless
