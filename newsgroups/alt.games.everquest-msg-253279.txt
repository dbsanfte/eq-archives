If you got GoD, the sewers have some nice drops, certainly better than
what you'll see pre-elemental and some better than you'll see pre-tier 3
time. 100 hp/mana jewellry, and some other nice things. I haven't tried
the sewers since the retuning but I think you'd appreciate your agro
locking abilities a bit more there, as it's about the only thing that
will keep the pulls from eating your slower and healer. If you have a
bunch of friends in a regular group coming back, you might find it
easier to get Kod'taz flagged than elemental flagged, as it can be done
with 1 group, and there's some nice drops in some of the other unflagged
zones as well, though not enough as the loot tables are shared a lot.

If you found the new taunt trivialized normal ldon, you might try hard,
where an out of control 900 hitting trash mob can wreak a lot of havoc
in your group.
