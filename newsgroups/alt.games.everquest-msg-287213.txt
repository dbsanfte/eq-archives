First, they have updated the game quite a bit, and alot of
optimization code went in.  As of a month ago I've been running it at
~40% of uber and it runs well enough.
Second, your PC should have run it from day one.  I have a 2.8 Intel,
single core, HT.  1GB RAM, and an ATI AGP card.  Ran crappy on day
one, but by the first patch it was playable at maybe 15% of uber.

The game mechanics are impressive as is the vastness.  Content has
been steadily improving but since I'm not hardcore it was plenty for
me from the beginning.  Like I said though, EQ is still my ultimate
game and I play VG simply because our guild is solely RL friends and
they all seem to like it better, so I sheep up and follow.
But when not playing EQ, VG is it for me.
