I have seen other run around with stuff that looks like a voodoo doll
or something like that, i'm kind of odd maybe but i like both spells
and the melee part, so yes maybe i should play as a shadow knight
which i do as well :)

Any good strategies for fighting would be nice, i kind of fire a
poison bolt on my target and when they get close i send my pet at
them, then leech and/or heat blood then melee.

And how do i get money, it seems to me that even a lvl 1 guy has
no problem coughing up 2pp for 20 bone chips, i have started to
do binds for money, that can give me some pp in the bank, but seeing
the prices on stuff auctioned in EC gives me the creeps :)
