I agree that there are very poorly subtitles movies, and that that is at
least as bad as a poorly dubbed movie.  All I can say on the subject is that
I have yet to see a dubbed movie where I liked the dubbing.  I have seen
many subtitled movies that were very well subtitled, including some where I
do speak the original language.  From my personal experience, the subtitled
ones have been better, and in particular, in the few rare cases where I have
seen both dubbed and subtitled, I enjoyed the subtitled version much more.
As I said in another post, I am a very fast reader, and the subtitles don't
stop me from being able to see the movie as well.  If we want to go into
specific examples, I'm sure that we can both come up with bad examples of
both dubbing and subtitling.  I personally have found that I enjoy subtitled
movies more than dubbed ones.  I'll have to check out some of the dubbed
movies that you have mentioned, perhaps I'll change my mind.  Ideally, of
course, I would just learn all the languages, and understand the movies as
originally made, but, practically, that is not an option.
