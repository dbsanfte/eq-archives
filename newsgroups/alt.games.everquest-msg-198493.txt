Ok, I have to disagree and here's why:
     1) there's a charm that helps if you max out your melee skills
    2) one day you are going to be oom and unable to get away. You have been
snared, or snared yourself. You have a badly damaged mob attacking you or a
horde of greens, who do little damage but hundreds of interrupts means no
chance o escape...

    Suddenly that sword  in your hands and defensive skills are the
difference between life and death.

    3) You are killing greens. Hundreds of them, perhaps for faction. Even
with kei, you can't keep throwing earthquake spells for long... but there's
a 2hb weapon     that procs earthquake. If you have decent skills in 2hb and
dex gear, mana is not an issue.

How do you increase melee?

    Well, my defense was boosted by getting decent armor so being hit didn't
hurt so much, and it's the number of hits that matters, and some db mobs hit
weakly         but quickly; DS yourself and let them tear themselves apart.
At 35, i'm guessing the dervishes in iceclad... probably with another healer
as partner and backup.         Pull to an iceflow, and avoid giants.

    As for offense, snare is your friend. What i do is snare a melee mob,
blat it away to the point where it tries to run, and stand behind it so it
can't riposte etc, and     hit autoattack. And watch tv. and read. And have
dinner. And eventually the mob dies or snare breaks, but my skills have had
a fair, danger free chance of             increase. You can also fear kite
animals but this is a risky busines... but if you want to play it safe, root
rot... why not live on the edge a little?
