Most of the time yeah.  But there are times, on a door, where there may be a
mob just inside the door on each side.  They not facing the wall, they
facing away from the wall, so you are a little behind and off to the side of
them.

Thanks to the monk pacify line, I have been able to pull in LDoN.  I can FD
at a door then open it up to see inside.  Move the camera angle in third
person around so you can see the entire room.  Just 2?  Great I pac one,
then pull.  3 in room?  If we have a pac class, I call for a pac on my
assist.  Then I pac the other one, and pull the third.  If nothing else it
saves a little mana on a pacify.  No pac classes?  We better have someone
that can root.  If an add comes, a root class will assist me and spam the
root key until mob is in range to cast.  Once I see it rooted, I back up,
tank starts beating on the single mob coming to group.

I have only had one failure being the puller on an LDoN, and that was when
we had no crowd control besides a snarer.  No pacify, no mez, no root...
Came across a tightly packed room of 7.  And we had to go through that room
to win it.  And there was no way to pull just 2-4.  Tried for 15 minutes,
each time all 6 came (except the one I pacified) and a single or two mobs
would never stay behind for someone to tag.  The entire bunch moved as one.
With less than 10 minutes left we just let it be down as a failure.

I don't mind what the monk is today.  I see a HUGE difference in the number
of blocks, ripostes, etc. that my monk at 63 does, vs. any other char I have
fighting the appropriate level mob.  But when I get hit, I get smacked hard.
But I also see a lot more misses towards my monk than I do playing any other
class.  And I can tell you he has crap laughable gear.  But it works.

I think smart play can overcome sub-par gear in most cases.  Sure, you don't
want a cleric that uses 80% mana for one complete heal, or a MT that has 2k
HP in the 60s.  My monk is not supposed to get hit.  Grouped last night in
BoT for several hours.  I never once needed a heal.  Just needed to make
sure to hit the mob from the right direction, smack that FD if I ever got
agro, etc.  Told the cleric to not even Virtue me, no use in wasting a
peridot.  Nothing a Mend and the group regen didn't take care of on the
incidental hits.

You don't need "twink gear" or "twink buffs" to play your class right, it
just makes us lazy and careless.  When the cleric joined up, he replaced our
KEI-less druid as our sole healer.  All he had was our bard.  Had a
virtue-less MT.  And we still chain pulled.
