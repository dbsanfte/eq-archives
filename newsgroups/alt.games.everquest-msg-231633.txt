Because the necromantic tradition is considered one of the most vile
paths out there. Once again, it's a magical path that only the most
evil of Norrathians would teach. The most evil Norrathians would be
almost all followers of the dark gods. Yeah, there would be
exceptions. But, the organized training would include religious
doctrine as well.

Hell, you can play yourself as following any faith you want. However,
the religion that you were trained under as a necromancer will be what
people see you as following. A Bible Scholar is generally viewed as a
Christian by most people IRL whether they are or not. It's no
different on Norrath. A Dark Elf Necromancer will be assumed to be a
child of Innoruuk, since devotion to him is what is taught by Neriak's
school of necromancy. Most Norrathians wouldn't take the time to chat
and see whether or not their assumptions are correct (Which is
probably safest for them, given that doing so could very easily prove
fatal if they are correct).

And it's NOT DIFFERENT FROM SHAMENS! Vah'shir aren't non-religious,
they just don't follow the norrathian pantheon. Vah'shir shamans
follow their culture's religion. Their culture's religion just doesn't
happen to be the same as Norrathian cultures.
