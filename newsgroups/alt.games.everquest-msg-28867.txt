Overclocking the processor too much causes instability.  That's not to say
that overclocking at all is going to cause a problem; it's just that you'll
eventually hit a certain point with every processor where things start
breaking.  First you'll notice random system instability such as freezes,
weird errors, blue screens of death, and program shutdowns, OCing further
will lead to Windows not being able to load, and OC even further than that
and the system won't post.  I couldn't give you exact technical reasons why,
but it happens when you go too far.  Overheating is usually the problem but
even if you cooled the system with liquid nitrogen you would not be able to
overclock a huge amount further than you would with standard air cooling.  I
would assume that if he has overclocked too much he would know that it's the
problem but it can't hurt to ask ;)
