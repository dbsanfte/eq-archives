Aye, thats one of the points I was making, but the other is that this 
lottery looks like a reward for participating in one of the various pp 
exploits out there.  I suppose they are thinking of it as a way to 
remove all that extra pp from the environment, but I'm looking at it as 
a way to reward people who's ill gooten booty was otherwise suffering 
from shrinking value of plat.

Cleric DoTs are 30 seconds, mage dots are 30 seconds... not that these 
are major DoT classes, mind you, but possibly being able to boost the 
dots with more focus effects will help change that, I'd have to do the 
math all over again to see if the spell lines compete with nuking.

1% loss?  Shouldnt that be a 5% loss, if its 95% of the actual mana you 
spent summoning the pet, or a 30% gain, if its 95% of the full cost you 
would have spent with no savings... 1% doesn't seem to make sense in 
either context.

Oh wait, if its 1% of the mana bar, that could be 5% of the actual cost 
of the summoning; depending of course on how much savings you are 
looking at, how large your mana bar is, which pet you are summoning and 
so forth.  Still, a small loss on the order of 1% would be what you'd 
expect if it was 95% of actual mana spent.

Ah, ok, I don't even know the name of the effect on Torch of Alna et al. 
  Not having any of the better focus items, I haven't paid the slightest 
attention to the names of the effects.

Aye, that is interesting too.  But without knowing what these spell 
lines now do, or if they've been scrubbed from the game completely, its 
hard to complain about specifics.

Will be -very- interesting for bards, who normally get at least one song 
per level... what do they get at level 3?

Problem is, many trade skills include an item or more that are dropped. 
  I guess the simple solution to that problem would be to treat those 
items as if they were worth whatever a merchant would pay.  They also 
probably aren't all that large a problem, as its much harder to macro up 
something that includes dropped items.

As I understand it, melee get openings which they apply their new skills 
to, creating conditions which in some cases are usable by everyone in 
the group or even raid.  I don't know the details of this, but I was 
wondering -if- its still true that something happens that my mage might 
want to respond to, if that response will mean going to this new box.

Sadly, FV is one character per account, so unless I want to abandon my 
new home, I'm stuck with mage if I want to stay in play range of my friends.
