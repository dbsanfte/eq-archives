From the shadows, the mysterious MV <nospam@nospam.com> (if that IS
his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>In my humble opinion it seems that the Plane of Knowledge tome-travel 
>system is ruining EQ.

Many people agree with you. The Vision, as derided as it was,
understood a couple things today's powerlevelers do not - sometimes
its the idea of a world that makes it interesting, and its not a world
if everything is two steps away from each other.

There's a current mindset of the population that would be just as
happy if all the mobs were lined up in front of them one by one to
kill so they don't have to move at all. You can see some of those
people in this very thread. This is the ascendant mindset and I don't
think there's any turning it back. It's going to infest the next
generation of mmorpgs, too, until there is finally a backlash against
them and some mmorpgs who dare to have a Vision instead of listening
to idiot players come along. Those will be the mmorpgs with a soul,
the ones worth playing.

Obviously some of the Vision won't be missed (book medding) and other
parts of it were compromised because of the age of the game, giving a
reason to make things a bit easier (nexus), but PoP went too far,
you're right.

That's why for all of the convenience it gives, some of the actual
feeling of EQ was killed at the same time. Of all the expansions, PoP
was the only one that actually felt like a step backwards (Luclin's
brutal graphics came close though).

Long live the Vision!
