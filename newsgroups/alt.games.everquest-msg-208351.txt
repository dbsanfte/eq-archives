Yes, some of the code dealing with auto-run and shift and alt is messed up.
Another common problem: if you start to type something into a chat window,
and then hit your up arrow key to move forward a bit, you'll be in autorun
mode.

You have to click your cursor into the text part of the chat window, to get
rid of the problem.

I hope they will have these problems fixed in the next patch, because this
last one has killed a lot of characters when they didn't expect to autorun
off a cliff :)
