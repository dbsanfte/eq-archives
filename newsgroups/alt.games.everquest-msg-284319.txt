Hi All

I thought I'd update this old post a bit, and re-post it with a
snippet of new info.  Some people found it useful at the time  :)

***********

For purely personal reasons, I didn't like *some* of the features of
the new UI Sony have given us (If you like it, that's great though,
heh). Specifically, I like the old-style 2 X 5 Hotbutton bars, rather
than the horizontal ones, and while I much prefer the *old* spell
icons, I actually like the smaller size of the *new* spell icons.
While in no way any use at designing UI's, I cobbled this together.


1) Make a folder in the Everquest UIFILES folder, giving it a name
that suits you.  For purposes of illustration, I will refer to it here
as "NewClassic" and into it you will need to copy 16 files.

2) Into this new folder, copy the following files over from the
DEFAULT_OLD folder (that's where they were in my EQ directory,
anyway)...

	gemicons 1, 2 and 3
	Spell_Icons
	spellbook01, 02, 03 and 04
	spells01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06 and 07

3) If you also want the old 2 X 5 Hotbuttons copy the following file
over from the DEFAULT_OLD folder...

	EQUI_HotButtonWnd

Then, while running Everquest, load the UI with the name you have
given it - in this example it would be NEWCLASSIC.  Voila!  Nothing
else to do, as any of the other files needed to run the UI will be
added anyway by the Everquest program.  I now get the benefits of the
nifty new features of the new UI, but with the layout I have grown
used to over the years.  

NEW BIT: I recently (well, about 4 or 5 weeks ago) got "Prophecy of
Ro" and the above UI works with the latest expansion, and shows me the
3 sets of bank slots.  I've had no trouble whatsoever using this
interface, either, which was something of a surprise!  Probably
because it was put together using Sony's own components, I would
think.
