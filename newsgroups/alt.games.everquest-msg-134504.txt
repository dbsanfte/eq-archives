I agree with the song gem bit, I liked that all songs of the same class 
had the same icon. It helped me sort them out in my books, I grouped them 
by spell class. And as if changing that wasn't enough, they put all spells 
in my spellbook in various places throughout the book :( I realize there 
are now eight slots per page, but couldn't they have simply moved the 
spells back to accomodate for more slots and less pages? I don't see how 
randomly throwing every spell in a different spot in the book was 
helpful...

Another problem I have which isn't directly involving the UI is that I can 
no longer push ESC with the tracking list open to stop tracking something. 
Previously I could push '1' (my hotkey) to bring up the tracking list, 
then push ESC and it'd close the list and stop tracking whatever I was 
tracking. Now I must click 'Cancel'. If they added another functionality 
to the ESC key I might understand, but I don't see anything on it. Why 
take something out that doesn't need to be?

In any case, the new UI is pretty cool looking but will definitely take 
some getting used to. Is there a way to keep a specific window 
nontransparent? I can't seem to figure out how to do that.
