To be quite honest... It bugs the crap out of me...  Why is the
berzerker weapon so over the top... the pally / sk epics have nothing
close to that ratio,  but yet when you look at the beastlord epic in
compairson to the monk epic, they both are of similar ratio and
abilities.   I use them as a compairson base from oldworld classes to
the new world classes.   

Epic weapons are in a dire need of a damage / delay upgrade.  I am
specificly talking about Melee epics.

as in all things, that is just my opinion...
