My point is, if there is one, that I would not use the healing analogy to
differentiate priests (wis casters) from Int casters.  My necro can heal in
a pinch, but I would never consider him a healer.  When the most HPs I could
heal is about 1K (only because I would die healing more), I would never
consider him a priest/healer.
