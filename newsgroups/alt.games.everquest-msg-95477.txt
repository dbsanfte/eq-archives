Something doesn't necessarily have to go wrong .... something unexpected
just has to pop up.  I was kiting spirocs in Tim Deep for the first time and
underestimated the speed at which they travel snared.  Well, I managed to
let a Proven get too close ... 95 hit/95 hit/35 bash/299 backstab.

My thought process went in this sequence:
- Wow, I didn't know Spirocs could backstab
- Hey, wait as sec ... that little tickle cost me about half my health.

I now run backward when kiting spirocs ..... :-)

Crash
