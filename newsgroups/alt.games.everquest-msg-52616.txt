To a point, true. Once you get to 12 you can pretty much kiss your melee
stuff goodbye. -however-

I would highly recommend that you not only get in there and take some
hits, but that you also solo one full level (or maybe half of a couple of
levels) between spell ranks. I usually solo out the last level before a
new rank of spells. If you -don't- do this, your Defense skill does not go
up, and you end up really paying for this as you move up in levels and the
mobs start hitting harder and harder. Your Defense skill has a major
impact on your total AC and the amount of damage you take from blows. It
is well worth the effort. Without it, you can pretty much guarantee you'll
be hit for the mobs maximum damage every time they so much as glance in
your direction. Enchanters have (usually) the lowest number of HPs in the
game - you can't afford to neglect your defense skills.
