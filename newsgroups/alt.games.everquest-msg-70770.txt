OH OK, you still have to reinstall the old world textures. Okay, this
may in fact explain why when I tried to go back to the old textures,
the eq patcher kept trying to download the new ones. If with the
install program you go back to the old texures make sure you change
that area to:

- <textures>
  -<oldworld>false</oldworld> 
 - <kunark>false</kunark> 
  -<velious>false</velious> 
  -</textures>

I ended up going back to my velious backed up EQ dir cds and 
just reinstalling luclin then without selecting to upgrade textures.
