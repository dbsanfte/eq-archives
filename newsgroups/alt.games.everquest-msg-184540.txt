Very early on in our relationship, my girlfriend heard me advise a
fellow poker player, "Your fiancee hates poker? Thank God you found
out before you married her. If you dumped her afterwards, she'd get
half your stuff."

The Favorite Sin does not play poker or EverQuest, but she's never
complained about either.
