> I really want to play EQ2 because the timing will be better.

If I were starting right now, brand new, I'd probably go for EQ2 or SWG.
Those will have cooler features and cooler graphics, and they'll have
learned from EQ (and other MMORPG's) how to run things right from the
beginning.

The downside, of course, is that there will be many bugs and a whole lot of
balancing to do, which may take a year or more.  EQ's been going over three
years and stuff still ain't balanced.

Uh huh... in a *single*-player game.  Not will thousands of people online at
the same time.

http://eq.castersrealm.com is a good place to start.
http://www.mobhunter.com is a great news site, and also has a bunch of links
on the front page that you can follow to find useful forums full of people
who will be glad to answer "newbie" questions.

> Also is there a server I should play on when new

Most of the servers are pretty well aged at this point, so there's no real
advantage of one over the other.  See if you can find a friend that already
plays EQ and join the same server they're on.
