I have a 29 BST and want to buy him some new weapons. Right now I have for
the 1hb a CentiWarhammer, the 2hb is the Sage's Battle Stff, Slime Coated
Harpoon for piercing, and a Horns of Spirits for H2H. I plan on spending
between 5k-10k on weapons. I want to know for my money what was would be
best for my lvl.

Thanks for any advise you folks you can give.
