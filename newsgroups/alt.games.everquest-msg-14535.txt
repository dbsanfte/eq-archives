Yes, that has always struck me as strange also,
but not as strange as the people who approach me out
of the blue, and ask if they can join my guild...

And it's not like we're a large guild whose reputation
precedes us, either, we're quite small.  I guess they
just like the (apparently) "cool" name.

It feels as creepy as someone knocking on the door of
my house, and asking, "will you adopt me into your
family"?

Ummm...  No.
