There are lots of guilds out there. Some are focused on the high end
content, so they only want to deal with experienced players. Then
there are the guilds whos focus is just on friendships and so on. I
dont know about the servers you play on, but there are plenty on
Cazic-Thule that accept anyone at any level. Just a word of warning
tho, guilds that recruit anyone at any time tend to get players of
questionable character which can alienate existing members. Try to
avoid any guild that openly recruits. Do a little research. Play a
little with members of the prospective guild. If they require at least
a sponsor, then thats good. It keeps the undesirables out (for the
most part).
