Thanks for the info, all...sorry bout posting twice here...the one account I
posted this first thread to didn't show up for about a day or so...used a
different provider which proved to be much faster!

And you were right about not stacking (which seems like a pain, but oh
well!)...I finally got it to work, and did all the quests for the warriors
except the last...at level three, don't take on that damn young lion!!!!
hehe


Thanks again,

JD
