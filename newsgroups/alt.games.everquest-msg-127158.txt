>>>I even checked a few items to see if I could equip an alt and the necro
weapon is a 2HB! What good is that?  It would keep me from being able to use
my offhand INT item that is +9 INT.

I think the weapons especially suck.<<<

Very true.. They would be VERY nice, IMHO, if they were switched to 1-hand!
:)

I had really hoped they would have added CLASS SPECIFIC focus effects on the
twilight stuff. If they were to add say "level III effect' then I think it
would CERTAINLY would be worth the effort. For the warrior and monks, they
could' ve added bonuses to skills like Dodge, Safefall, etc.

(Althought I must say the druid tunic is DAMN nice for someone who doesn't
have acccess to a large guild. At 15ac, 8wis, 3dex, 5sta, 10hp, 20mana,
2fr/cr/mr its better than a Shroud of Nature. Equipped on Half Elf with
legs, bracers and gloves
