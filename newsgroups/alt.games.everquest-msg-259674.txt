The only problem that I might be seeing is your pause time (knowing that you
have /doability and not /bash)  Time are in tenths of a second.

ie a 1 second pause is  /pause 10   your /pause time is only 7/10's of  a
second.  I don't know if your bash refresh is that fast, but I don't think
it is.  Try /pause 30 and see if it works, or even /pause 50 (5 second
pause)  if it works with a high time, then begin to work the numbers to get
as fast as possible.

Hope this helps some.
