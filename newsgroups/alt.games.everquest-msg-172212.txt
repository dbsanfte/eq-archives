Ok, this leads me to a slightly different question.  I know many guilds have
a policy that anything you get on guild raids is "guild property," to be
returned if you leave the guild.  To me, that seems to be a load of bovine
scatology.  The loot someone earns in guild raids is reward for the time
they spent helping the guild out (especially if it's a point-based system).
Maybe he's gone to ten raids to get a breastplate, that's how many hours of
his own time spent on the guild?  And then they ask for the BP back?  I say,
if they can't return the time he spent on them, he shouldn't have to return
the loot.  Granted, this doesn't count for stuff he recieves out of the
guild vault, unless it's bought with DKP's.  It seems like this is a
self-serving policy on the guild leaders' parts.

What's y'all's take on that?
