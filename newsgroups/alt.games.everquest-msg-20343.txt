"Davian" <spam.someone.else@home.com> sez:

>less effective)

	Incorrect.

	Assuming you keep both skills maxed for your level, Kick and Bash
are both 6/100 "weapons" for Melee and Hybrid characters (except for Monks)
levels 20-50.  All else being equal, a Warrior will, on average, do the
same damage with Kick as with Bash over any given time frame.

	But all else does not remain equal.  Specifically, Kick caps at
149, which happens at 29th level.  Once you're a few levels past 29th, Kick
will begin to behave as though you were fighting yellows, then reds, then
deep reds.  When you fight reds, you will hit for minimum damage far more
often than for any other single damage value.  And minimum damage for Kick
is 1 point of damage.

	Here's a graph of what Kick looks like for a 48th level Warrior:

	http://www.erols.com/aburner/kickgraph01.jpg

	Note that the damage value which gets more hits than any other
damage value is the Minimum damage: 1 point.  Average damage per kick:
6.38 points of damage.

	By contrast, here's a graph of what Bash looks like for a 45th
level Warrior:

	http://www.erols.com/aburner/bashgraph1.gif

	Note that the majority of the hits do *not* fall on the Minimum
Damage value.  The point value with the most hits is 12, which is the Magic
Number for a DMG 6 "weapon" with no Level Damage Bonus.  Average damage per
bash:  8.32 points of damage.

	Again, Bash and Kick are on the same timer.  And a 45th level
Warrior is doing more damage per Bash than a 48th level Warrior does per
kick.  And they both have the same chance-to-hit (roughly 60%).

	Therefore, starting a few levels after Kick caps, you will do more
damage with Bash than with Kick.  Before that, you'll do the same damage
with Bash as with Kick.



>2) You're possibly losing weapon attack.  No matter how fast you switch,

>expires.

	There's always that chance.  And it probably does indeed happen on
occasion.  Maybe you'll miss one swing out of every 100.  As someone who's
been ghetto-bashing for over 20 levels, I can promise you that once you get
practiced at it, you'll never, ever notice a drop in your damage output.
And in exchange, you're getting extra damage from Bash, plus spell
interrupts, plus stuns.

	This is indeed a valid reason for not doing it.  It's the only one,
though.  =)
