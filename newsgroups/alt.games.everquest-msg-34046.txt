You've already gotten some good advice here, but I'll throw in another
two copper pieces. I've played duo a *lot*, previously with a
monk/shaman combo, and now with a warrior/cleric pair. You can go quite
a ways with the warrior/shaman duo, should you wish, but at the higher
end of the game you're going to start to suffer unless you start
regularly advertising for more players to join your group. I've tried,
at my level, doing a few short sessions of duoing with a shaman of
roughly equal level. Believe me when I tell you the following:  The
shaman's buffs rock, no doubt. But they do *NOT* ... repeat *NOT* heal
like a cleric. Your warrior is a tank, and it doesn't sound like you are
financially ready to twink out your warrior with uber damage weapons.
You will kill things _slowly_ and require a lot of heals while you do
it. A shaman of equal level will eventually fall behind you in their
ability to keep up with the damage you'll be taking from mid-blue mobs
after you get into the forties and fighting in zones appropriate to that
level. It's a great pairing to *base* a larger group on, but if you two
are really interested in doing primarily duo stuff, you'll want a
cleric. But as you indicated you are already aware, you should keep up
your larger group skills anyway, so the two of you could just get used
to advertising for additional group members to hopefully include a
cleric, chanter, and some massive damage dealer like a rogue, monk, or
wiz. (But watch out for the monks. :-p  )
