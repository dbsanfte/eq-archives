I read that there is a limit to the amount of mana a person can regen
from bard songs during each six-second tick. That would imply that,
although the level 20 and 32 songs will stack, there is no benefit to
power pulsing them - or stopping and starting them to get more pulses
than one every six seconds. Something about "phantom mana" and it
going away upon the casting of the first spell afterward.

Is this true? It has seemed that pumping the mana songs as fast as
possible has really increased the mana regen, but I have done no
thorough testing. Could anyone verify with their own findings please?
