I think your parenthetical "(they just go solo)" is the reason rogues 
complain more about not getting groups.

I've made it a firm practice to be certain I could solo any character I 
was running, regardless of class.  Doesn't have to be great but it does 
have to work ok.  Then, I can go LFG while being productive, and you 
won't hear me bitch much if I dont find a group in ten minutes.. .or in 
an hour or even all night.

Also, being able to solo means I can add -any- class as a duo, or trio, 
etc, and still be able to be productive, because they are just a boost 
to what I'm doing, if the combination isn't sufficient to let us move to 
something better.

Rogues strike me as the class least likely to be able to put this idea 
into practice; their defensive abilities tend to lack oomph, and they 
lose a very significant portion of their DPS when solo until fairly late 
in the game.  And thats a self fulfilling prophecy, I was just noticing 
in guild a 56 rogue who was crowing because his Defense skill had just 
hit 140.  My berserker's Defense was nearly 100 points higher, because I 
spend an inordinate amount of time getting beat on, considering I'm 
technically a DPS class.

While a rogue is a great addition to any group which already has a core, 
he's not so capable of forming a core himself; he needs to find all 
three classic elements while anyone in a core class only needs to find 
the missing two.  In the meantime, he's also not happily soloing while 
waiting.

What to do with his spare time?  How about complain!

Grage, 56 Berserker (roughly 25% soloed, because oddly zerkers seem to 
get groups easily)
Grager, 13 Ranger (100% soloed)
Llyric, 57 Bard (75% soloed)
Paax, 52 Shaman (about 50% soloed)
Splendid One, 65 Mage (about 40% soloed just cause I had Teapray and 
Lenny and Rzantha and a couple other regulars that wanted to group all 
the time)
Bergh, 65 Cleric (50% solo... but only cause I'm hard headed that way)
