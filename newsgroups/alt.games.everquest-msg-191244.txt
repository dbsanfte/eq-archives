It's not built on the real world, it's built on a model of how
e.g. tradeskilling should work, how difficult it should be to do stuff
in Norrath. The character advancement system is completely unrealistic
in real world terms, why shouldn't the trade skill system be allowed
to be unrealistic as well? It's a game, not a simulation.

And how would you have done the /loc command? You could remove it, but
how would you make it more realistic? Putting it in terms of distance
from landmarks instead of absolute coordinates? That would actually be
a nifty way to do it, with an orienteering skill improving the
precision. I'm not sure why /loc is in there. It's not required for
informing CS staff of where you are, since that could easily be
recorded by /petition, /report and /bug. Perhaps to make it easier to
find your corpse, or to make it easier to draw accurate maps, which
would be bloody hard without in-game help.
