I take it that this name is a violation due to ( I think ) the magic user in
the "Sword of Shannara" series?

Of course it's always possible that it isn't a deliberate infringement :) I
can just imagine someone complaining about a name of one of my characters
from some book I'd never read or heard about heheh.

Just an idea. It's quite possible that things like this are deliberate but I
always take into account the fact that there are only so many ways to put
letters together ( players name might've been Allan for example and they
just whacked something on the end :)  )
