In WC there was certainly a lot of that whining going on. There was also
some far more *legitimate* whining that every time the WW Overlord
spawned, rather than letting the event run for a while, some fucking
moron had to immediately kill it. That was sad.

Yep. It was weird. Tiru was running in to meet my baby necro in WC to
hand off some stuff for me. We ran *past* each other going up and down
the sand along the wall three times before we found a landmark we could
both go stand by for a few seconds, when we "popped" into view. Very
odd.

In some ways, I'm happy these events are over, though they were very
interesting and some good loot dropped.  But I want to actually hunt in
some of those zones with my alt, and they turned into death traps quite
fast while all the big mobs were out.
