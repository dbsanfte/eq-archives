Yeah, the guy seems like a troll (prolly more like a kid who is a usenet 
tough guy) but I think he was asking a simple question and it has gotten 
outta hand.  He just wants to leave the game and give/sell his account which 
we all know is against the rules, but he asked anyway.

 All you have to do is ignore these kinds of messages that do get posted 
here on occasion.  I don't think these folk destroy the fun of the game or 
anything (for me at least), but it is a bit annoying to see tham hawking 
their old accounts here like it is a flea market.

Anyway this is prolly just a kid shooting his mouth off where it is safe to 
do so.  Chances are, if he were standing in front of you, ass clown would 
never come outta his mouth.

Comments?
