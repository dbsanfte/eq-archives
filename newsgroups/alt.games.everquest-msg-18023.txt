Hail all ;-)
Just a question i would like to hear your opinions about,
1st: Its the old twinking problem.
I started some characters and see myself still as a newbie.
Chars are lvls 7-16 now.
I find it more than frustrating to see almost all chars round lvl 5-10 (or
even under) with armor and weapons like 50+  !
Why should we do anymore quests ? Just make one highlvl and then twink
the next few - is that the way ? I dont believe in that.
2nd: Why all that shouting ?
I know i can suppress it with options but i think it is ok in SOME cases. Im
on Brell Serilis now and you cant even read as fast as people shout Topics
ooc in the chatwindow.
I consider it as a a very sad fact cause im roleplaying live and pen&paper
for years and it IS a big break in athmosphere i think.
Anyway - i understand that other people have other opinions about that so
pls do me a favour and give me response if im alone with mine.
(BTW ironically people accuse me of beeing twinked cause i have to ask for
some in-game abbreviations cause im germane and have some language problems
...)

Thanks in advance
