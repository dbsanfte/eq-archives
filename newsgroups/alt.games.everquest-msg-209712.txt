The problem was worse when I was hanging out in Ragnarok Online during
the end of the beta recently. If multiple people who weren't grouped
killed a single mob, each person would get a % of the xp based on how
much damage they did to the mob. This really sucked when someone came
along and started beating on a mob that you had solid aggro on....They
were basically sucking a % of the xp for the kill off of you with no
risk to themselves. Needless to say, the so-called "helpers" were FAR
more abundant there. Not to mention the "Oops! Lag"ers and the "Oh! I
didn't see you hitting it!"ers....
