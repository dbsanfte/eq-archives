Once you hit the high-40s low 50s Druids have a hard time keeping up
with the damage output of the mobs you will be fighting. WIth a Shaman
you have the ability to slow the mobs and haste the tanks. That is why
the best "2-box" duo has always been thought to be Shaman/Monk (ore
perhaps Shaman/SK now that Monks are nerfed)
