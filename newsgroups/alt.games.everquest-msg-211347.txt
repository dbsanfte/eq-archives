: ?  You're saying that if you put on 25/tick worth of items you still only
: get 17/tick?
:
: I assume there probably is a cap, but 17 seems highly unlikely since you
can
: hit that total with two or three items easily.

He is corect that there is a Cap on HP regen from Items Pre 61, but it is
more than 17 . I am 39 and regen 25 Per tick siting down ( Ogre Sk 3 points
normal sitting, 5 Points (Zlandicar's Heart - Regereration) (actualy is
called Dragon Regeneration internaly), 15 points (Fungus Covered Scale
Tunic - Fungal Regrowth), 2 points (Belt of the Great Turtle - Aura of
Battle)  I beleave that the maz for item regen is 23, that is what I was
told by a former guildmate that's brother is a GM.

As far as stacking goes as long as it doesn't have the same effect it will
stack.  Zandi will stack with other Regeneration items, because like I said,
internaly it is named Dragon Regrowth, even though it is listed as regrowth.

Now for your Cheap coment. It isn't going to happen. the few items that are
unlimited charges and tradeable go for exorbanat amounts.  On TZ a Zandi
will fetch 30+k every day. FCST go for around 75 - 100K depending on supply
and demand.

The best item in game is there for anyone that did the quest for the inner
acrilia caverns key. The Hollow Acrylia Obelisk is now the one of the best
charm's in game (the PoP one may be better situationaly) AC 8, STR 7, STA 7,
Wis 5, INT 5, Cha 7, HP 45, Mana 40, Sv ALL 8, Effect:   Reclamation (20 Hp
Per tick Regen )

They toned it down a bit, it was 20 Hp and 20 mana per tick, +50 Attack
rating.  Still wish it had the Mana on it though.

After 61 I beleave that there is no max HP regen by items. If you want to
fill yourself up with low AC low Stat items to get some regen in every slot
( given that they are diferent types) then you can. I know of one person
with the Hollow Acrylia Obelisk and a fungi and fungi heart. 45HP tick plus
his natural gives him over 60 Per tick regen.
