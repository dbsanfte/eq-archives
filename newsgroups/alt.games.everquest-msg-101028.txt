>Although not as extensive as the ongoing work on EQ, you don't honestly

No, but that is the business model that boxed games run under.
Unfortunately the industry is constantly shipping half-baked games
that require patching. Gamers have become inured to dowloading a patch
before they run most games for the first time. Pretty sad.

Most updates and add-ons are driven by the playing community (like
Counter-Strike, Sims). Others (like you mention) are driven by
developers who are committed to their product, even post-release. That
doesn't change the basic business mode..

Develop->Ship->Collect Profits 
Rinse and Repeat

We can agree to agree :-)
