Hes an old-world mob, but his hp are > 32k

Smallest crew to kill him.. hmm, cazic is not really a straight forward
fight.  His melee damage isnt all that bad (Ive monk tanked him pre and post
nerf), his spells aren't too bad (his fear seems to hardly stick), what
makes him tough is that with his avater snare/knockback your melees get
thrown away from the battle, and it takes them a short while to get back in
range to kill.

It makes the fight last significantly longer than a mob of his HP should
take, so the key things here are healing and mana supply.

You need enough clerics to keep the chain going/fill in for each other, but
you also need a way of creating mana for them

36 people?  wow thats brave :)

I remember my first killing of CT after he got beefed up (this WASNT with my
current or then guild!!)  they were the second/third biggest guild on the
server, and after 2 wipes with 45 people, it turned into a mass-recruited
85person pickupraid that still had to zerg him (they were the resident zerg
guild, tho!)

We kill CT with 30 people 'comfortably', but thats with 99.9% of the guild
at level 60, primal on virtually every melee (and most the casters/druids
now), but also people who know the fight inside-out.

We've engaged once with 22ish (this is all pre-pop) and it was a bit iffy bu
t we won

How close did you guys get?   Do your guildies all have a right clicky?
Where did you pull him to?  Did you know about levitate/knockback?
What strat did you try?

If you kill Cazic, I think your whole guild would just about shit their
pants at his loot (check the stats on choker, cloak, pauldrons, brain, eye,
halo)
