I've played a mage to level 65, but I've never had the epic pet.  Instead of
me writing information about the epic that might not be correct, I invite
you to take a look at threads such as these at the Mage Tower
http://forum.magecompendium.com/viewtopic.php?t=1422
http://forum.magecompendium.com/viewtopic.php?t=9418#petstats

Basically, the epic pet is definitely the pet of choice until you reach 61,
far outclassing any pet you can summon until then.  When you get to 61+, the
choice becomes more difficult.  The epic pet can still be the most damaging
pet, but as you take on higher level mobs the effectiveness of the epic pet
compared to the 61-65 pets declines.

Of note, even though you can get the spell Summon Orb at 46, you can't then
use the Orb to summon the pet until level 51.  The Orb has nice stats, so
it's a good item to have even at 46, but you can't begin using the Epic pet
until a bit later.  Given the difficulty of the magician's epic quest, the
improvement of the level 61-65 pets over their predecessors, and the fact
that leveling is a bit easier than before (or a lot easier, depending on who
you talk to) the best advise is usually to bypass the epic, work towards 65
then go back and then get it if you really want it.

Regarding the level 52 fire pet (and it's level 58 and 63 kin), it was a
decent idea by Verant/SoE that leaves much to be desired in the
implementation.  They are "wizard" pets.  They cast nukes (yah!), but
quickly go out of mana (boo!) and then start meleeing, which they are poor
at (double boo!).  The buffs they cast on themselves are unremarkable,
basically, whatever variation of shielding a wizard at their level could
cast, Shieldskin (?), and O'Kiels Embers (?), a very, very, very small
damage shield.  The fire pet that so many mages loved pre-50 gives way to a
pet many mages think is worthless.

The monster summoning line does not summon a monster from the zone.  It
summons a pet that looks like a mob from the zone taken at random.  This pet
will have the same hp's as a comparable earth pet, but avoids/mitigates
damage better so it tanks better than an earth pet.  A MS pet does not cast
any spells (i.e. root, stun) but, on occasion, you'll summon one that gives
itself a DS comparable to a pre-50 fire pet.
