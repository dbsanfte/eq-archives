Antonius Bayle server?

I know many servers were down, according to the network stats page (my 
Drinal being one of 'em :-/) but I noticed AB was one of the ones up.

Let us just hope that this downtime was to beat the BST Warder's with the 
nerf bat. I was grouped with a guy last night who had a 15 BST. I, a 14 
chanter, watched the pet solo Derv3 in NRo with one blue, one white, and 
one yellow con (to me) dervs and minimal assistance from the beastlord.

As a chanter, I felt gypped. Why the hell do I get the only "short bus" pet 
in the game? ;)
