Okay.  Last night I was in a pickup group in Paw, a warrior, a wizard, a
ranger and me the cleric.  Things we going alright, exp was rolling
fairly steady.  Our ranger went through the door deeper in to pull back
to us.  Well she comes back in with two gnolls behind her, not too
difficult.  Unfortunately, then 3 gnolls pop in the room around us.  I
know we probably can't handle this, but I figure I'll stick it out for a
bit.  Then an NPC casts something on the ranger, although it said she
was LD and she starts attacking me for some reason.  I know this is
going to go badly.  So I tell the group to run and I gate out.  The
wizard makes it out; however, the ranger and warrior do not.  The ranger
said I did the right thing; however, the warrior was pissed that I gated
out.  So was I wrong in this situation?
