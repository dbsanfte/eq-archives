I just pull with slow, then root the mob between it's swings, and move off
allowing Jabober to earn his keep.  Apply a DoT or two, and sit around
medding.  It still works quite well at 56, just watch for unrootable mobs.
If a mob is unrootable, Jabober gets aggro off me soon enough not to be a
real issue, I just have to wait a while before applying a DoT in that case.
