This paragraph makes my head hurt.  My only point was that in applying the 
'exception proves the rule' maxim, it is expected that the exception will 
contradict it, so Sanjy's counter-argument made no sense. :) I've already 
forgotten what the original proposed rule was.  But I recall thinking that 
it wasn't a valid use of EPTR either.

As to 'burden of proof', people are always pointing fingers on usenet as to 
where the burden of proof belongs.  I think it's only fair to lay the 
burden of proof on whoever wants their point proven, regardless of where 
the fences are.
