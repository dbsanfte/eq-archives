Being that the Items never leave the game except by accident how much is an
FBSS worth on a server with 2000 players and 2500 FBSS's. The FBSS was very
difficult to get before Kunark because very few where above 45. Now a level
55 can solo the Frenzy spawn and the Market is being flooded with FBSS the
prices drop. Lower Guk used to require a good group to be successful who
know with SOL and the expansion after that maybe players will be soloing the
current Dragons in the future at level 75 and a Cloak of Flames will be 5k.
