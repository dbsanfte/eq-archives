Well, many places do allow you to kill in self defense (or is that 
defence in Australia? :b) or defense of others.  I would hope that is 
allowed most anywhere.

Here in the US, there are places where you are actually allowed to kill 
in defense of your property as well.  As I recall, some years back, 
California changed the laws such that someone breaking into your home is 
presumed to present a lethal threat, and as such, you are presumed to be 
defending yourself and/or your family when using whatever force you deem 
necessary, regardless of whether or not the intruder is armed.
