Hahaha, I'll have to try that one.

Level 1 halfling rogues (of Brell!) are more fun, to wander around and take
pics of stuff.  You're either non-kos (even though they con 'scowls' they
won't agro) or hide/sneak works.

Level 1 worshippers of Zek can wander around in Kael safely, anywhere but
the throne room area and the temple (temple is north past the PoZ wall,
throne area is south past the wolf pits), and if you do it right they can
also get corpses safely. (I've pulled corpses through a fully spawned arena
past the see invis line without dying)
