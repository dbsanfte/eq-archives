Although Dark Age of Camelot is still a little rough around the edges, this
is one of the things I find appealing about it.  Mythic can reward decent
items and experience points for quests because every player can only do each
quest one time.  Therefore, you never run into the Tumpy Tonic fiasco or
whatever it was; I was never much of a quest doer.

I think these are some changes that definitely could be made to EQ.
