}~sigh~  I feel bad now.  Usually, when I've been asking for ports, I
}give 3 to 5 pp.  I didn't know that was low.

Don't worry, I'm sure to most druids, an acceptable donation is 
proportional to your means to pay.  At least if -I'm- porting a lowbie in 
non-twink armor, and he puts 3pp up, I'm hitting cancel.  Not because I'm 
offended or anything, but because I was an untwinked lowbie once, and I 
know 3pp is a hell of a lot more money to him than it is to me. :)
