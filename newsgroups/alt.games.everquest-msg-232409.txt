From the shadows, the mysterious 42 <user@example.net> (if that IS his
real name) conspiratorially whispered:

The first rule of thumb I see making the most sense is use an augment
on an item that is already strong in whatever that augment gives. So
for example if you are a ranger and get a +6 dex augment, you put it
in the best piece of dex gear you use. The second rule of thumb is to
augment better items before lesser items, and of course the third is
augment the least likely item to be upgraded any time soon.

That maximizes the lifespan of the augment before you upgrade, on
average (though of course shit happens sometimes and you upgrade in
unexpected places).
