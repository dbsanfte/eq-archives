That's a piece of the Druid epic quest.  The corruptor is triggered, and
hopefully killed so that the Druic can loot a piece off of him for his epic.
Much like Miragul in Evrfrost, except he's in a secret cave, so there
shouldn't be any newbie death in that encounter, unless someone pulls him
out of the cave to Fear kite him.
