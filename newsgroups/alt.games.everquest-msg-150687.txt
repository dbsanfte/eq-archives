Bilge isn't THAT rare.

Sleeper only ever spawns ONCE per server, and not at all on some... until
todays' patch, at least ;o)

Mayong Mistmoore is another that some servers have never seen... pretty sure
he's never appeared on either of the Bayles yet... simply because he's GM
controlled.


Absolute rarest?
Well,  there's prolly a few dozen 'triggered' spawns people have missed and
simply never triggered. There are a few quests that are broken because a
needed NPC hasn't been added... and a few quests people swear are broken for
the same reason, we just don't know HOW to trigger the NPC (and Verant won't
tell) :o)
