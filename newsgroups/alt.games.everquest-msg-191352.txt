    As stated at Fan Faire, they consider the people that post to boards to
be in the minority of EQ users. So when they get say ten threads, each with
20 responses saying "yeah, me too" they don't project that as being a larger
issue. Sometimes that's right, like when uberguilds whine about an encounter
that maybe 10 or 20 guilds can even access, and sometimes that's wrong, like
here. Damned if you do, damned if you don't.

    See? See? DT does it, too! ;-)

    Honestly, I'm surprised that the people that play at SOE didn't pick up
on it with their play characters. I wonder how configuration-specific the
problem is?

    Oh, they don't have to fake blindness on things. ;-) Two statements made
at Fan Faire sort of underline how out-of-touch they can be:

(1) Slicing a cake. One player in a forum made a comment about a grandmaster
baker with trophy failing to slice a cake. Everyone laughed, then Scott
Hartsman (bigwig on Dev team) asked, "Seriously? A Grandmaster baker can
fail slicing a cake?" People who know even a tiny bit about tradeskills know
about the 95% (could be 96%) max success rate on the vast majority of
combines.

(2) Displaying mana pool as a number. When asked if this could be done, the
Dev team said that they weren't opposed to it as they were in the past.
However, they still had reservations because this information could be used
to see how messed up the spell system is. Whether they meant the spell
system is messed up now, or whether this would be a future concern, wasn't
really clear. But in any event - telling us you want to hide a central piece
of information because we'd be able to see when stuff is messed up? WTF?
