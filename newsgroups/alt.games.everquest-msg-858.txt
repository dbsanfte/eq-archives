 Ok I can go with that. I wasn't sure if the effect was a proc or not
(Shamans got screwed on their Epics). The effect is indeed right-click
so 1hs is pretty irrelevant in the usage of their weapon. It still would
be a good idea to work on 1hs though in my opinion. It would probably
help on clearing out greenies if you ever felt like tanking them. It's
probably easier just to right-click them as well.
