1) Resist issues
2) Stun/Interrupt issues

In both cases I'll often be able to only twist 2 or even 1 song
reliably. And in some of those cases that song(s) being up all the
time is more critical than anything else I could be doing.

3) Chain Mezzing

Occasionally chain mezzing is the best way to fight particularly nasty
mobs. 

Its a nice backup when cease / desist / stun / bash / etc aren't
landing reliably enough to shutdown a cheal/gate/etc mob or when the
normal interrupter is running oom.
