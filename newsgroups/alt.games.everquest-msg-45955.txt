Hrm, let me see what I can remember. Jakys (monk) and Tirra (shaman)
hunted with Orlun in East Karanas one night when we were all in the low
20s, with Cidric (a cleric), and I remember irritating Cidric because I
did more healing than he did.

Then I decided that I wanted to slow down on my playing, and focus on
the real world a little, and play a few alts. Jakys started Jakugg, and
I started Tiru, Tirna (high elf enchanter), Tir (wood elf warrior), and
Tirea (heretic cleric). I had them all close to level 10 or better by
the time Jakugg hit 20, and a few other alts besides. I decided to focus
on Tiru partly because I constantly heard him bitching about not having
anyone who would heal him. When Tiru hit 17ish, he headed to High Hold,
and after a few good sessions and a lot of horrid ones, he left at 25
with his testament of Vanear, and travelled to Najena where Jakugg had
just soloed his way through 30 or 35 on the brand new "a skeleton"
there. We played together, and it was good. I think I zipped through to
30 in about 4 evenings. We traveled to Velious, because  Velious is
where people go when they hit 30. But the cougars, while blue at 30, are
tough, and we died often. We tried giants in Rathe and Oasis, and died
there too. Then we went to Split Paw, and inside the lair, we quickly
made our way up, and it was here that Orlun began to join us. I don't
remember if he came to Najena. 

Then we tried the cougars again, and we could kick cougar butt. I don't
remember if it was Kodiak caves before Tower of Frozen Shadow, or ToFS
before the Kodiak Caves. ToFS was more interesting, but the nice folk
outside of Velks often buffed us as they headed in, and it was good to
have an escape route handy. Then we hit the bank of Rathe Mountains, and
many hill giants fell before our might. The only reason I have any money
is thanks to these guys. Otherwise, we've mostly hunted with zero loot
places. Off next to City of Mist. Then we tried Seafuries and Spirocs,
but unless you can quad-kite or mez, the Spirocs are a bear. We can do
neither, so we left. Seafuries are great, unless you get more than one,
or the tainted.

Rules to live by: know the timer of the zone you are in. Know your role,
and the limits of your party. Save the herbs for the rogue, save the
gems for the caster who will use them. Schedule when you will meet, and
share emails so you can negotiate where to travel next. And you if you
ever need an all night camp, trade phone numbers so you can call and
wake each other (but only do that if you trust them).

Hope this helps someone,
-Tiru
