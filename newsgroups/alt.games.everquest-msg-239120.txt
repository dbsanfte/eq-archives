I was messing around in my UI and came across this item in "options". Can
not remember exactly where but I can not get it to work. I think it would be
great feature to have. I can not see very well and many names seem to be
made so they are hard to figure out (IllIliL) or just too long. And if you
think I am silly then just remember it will happen to you when you get
older. 55 years old am I, and yes I love computer games.  So my question is
can any here tell me how to get this feature to work. Thanks to the spelling
checker you may not noticed I am a lousy typist.

It is pretty cool to have your wife and son on at the same time.
