Thought occured to me (rare occasion) that the number one problem with EQ is
that risk vs reward is completely and utterly fucked up for for *plucks
percentage out of ass* say, 90% of all encounters.

That leaves everyone squabbling over the remaining 10% which is actually
worth your time to bother with. So - given that bad content requires
manhours to produce just like good content - what an absolute fuggin waste
of resources it is.

Why don't they just bite the bullet and revise this shit?

Why do they churn out expansion after expansion of 90% crap content?

Whats the use of having the biggest game world if everyone knows exploring
is a waste of time as you need to study where the good 10% is?

Hmmn - anyway, just a drunken thought that occured to me when the SK spires
were camped out and I decided to take on a similarily conned shadowed man
who happened to be cleric based... I gated out, I knew I would lose my
entire mana pool without dinging the bastid and they have nothing to show
anyway.

*shrug*
