After 20th start looking for bigger damage weapons than the Carver (Although
I used one 'til 29th)
Many of the considered mid range 2hders are now incredibly cheap.
Black Alloy Bastard Sword prolly the best value at around 200pp.

I think black alloy is as good as banded and lighter (also looks good for
SK's)
not sure what people sell it for, I was getting shot of it for 2pp per AC
but now I just look for non twinks to give it to.

Not sure where Dark Forge falls short to Rygorr? what piece? (OK Bracers,
definitely and there is no DF collar but the Rygorr one is hard beaten in
that slot, by anything else I'd say the DF wins it)
Rygorr is a definite no no for a Human SK, Human paladin, maybe but anything
else, eugh!...it's bright GOLD FFS, this is some of the best Chain armour
available for mid levels and human Rangers, Rogues and SK's end up looking
like Elvis doing a show at Ceasar's Palace. What were Verant thinking when
they designed that graphic.

Sentient is very good for the low int races, Ogres and Trolls don't really
need the physical stats that DF or Rygorr give but with intelligence on
every piece it is (or was) very sort after for SK twinks, now being sold off
at much cheaper prices.

These three armour types are a little pricey, I'd imagine, for you atm.
Basically concentrate on getting the best AC armour you can for the plat.
