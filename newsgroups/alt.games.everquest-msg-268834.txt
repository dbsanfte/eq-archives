Yes, each character has the option of doing a quest to betray their starting
city and join the opposing faction.

Once you join the opposite city, your final subclass will be the options for
your new city.   (If you join Qeynos as a troll crusader, your only option
will be to become a troll paladin at 20.   You cannot be a shadowknight of any
race and serve Qeynos.)

The betrayal quest must be begun after level 15 and before level 17 or 18.
So before you choose your subclass you have to decide which city you want to
end up at.
