Hehe, you should have seen a few guys at my server:
Small pieces of acrylia 300pp each
Small piece of acrylia 400pp each
Flawless rockhopper hides, 2000pp each
Superb Rockhopper hides 1000pp each
HQ rockhopper hides, 100pp each


With these prices, people would loose 7 gp from making 10 slot backpacks 
(sell at 100pp at my server).
And the material cost on Studded Acrylia Cloak would be 5600pp (sell for 
1500-2K), and Reinforced Acrylia Bracer would be 2400pp (sell for 500pp)
