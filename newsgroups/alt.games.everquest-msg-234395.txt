There seems to be some confusion over this. The change to needing DX9
is one thing, and that is on test. But that isn't the new engine, it
can't be (for one thing, I play there as my main server and I haven't
noticed one whit of change nor has anyone else mentioned any).
Sometime in the next couple months, there's supposed to be an actual
new engine? Whatever it is, it's not on test. Maybe it's on the beta
server, I don't know.
