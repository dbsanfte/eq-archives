I successfully hunted Drakkal Dire Wolves, and later Frost Giant
Scouts, using the Coldain wolves and guards to do most of the
heavy lifting.  I'd drag my prey over near one of my allies, root
it, and back away.  If the wolf or giant won, all I had to do was
finish it off with a nuke or two.  If the Coldain won, well, I'd
only spent enough mana for a root or two. Later I refined this
technique, casting fear on the coldain if it got close to a win, then
atoning when it got a little distance, whereupon I could go
back and pick off the almost dead Drakkal/Frostie.

Depending on how relatively powerful the Gnomes are, you
could use similar techniques with the snow cougars to solo them
with almost no mana expended.  Just try not to think about
the potentially lost earrings from the times where the pirates
win one.
