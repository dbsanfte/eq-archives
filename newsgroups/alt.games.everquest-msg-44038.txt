OK, I betcha most of you are tired of this kind of thread, but I've run
out of ideas for where to hunt. (Well, not run out of ideas, but can't
really think of any place that fits the bill...)

What I am:

Level 50 cleric

What my party might consist of:

Probably a ranger, a monk, a mage and a necromancer (plus me, of course)
Quite possibly not all of those at the same time tho', as there is some
difference in when these guys log on and stuff. These guys vary in level
between 47 and 53.

Setting:

Outdoors, fear kiting is a great way to exp. If we're all on at the same
time, I wouldn't mind taking on dungeons, either.

What's Right Out:

We're shooting for different Velious faction, so we can't really go for
any factioned mobs, which is a bummer, cause I think hunting in Kael is
great fun...

I've not done any exp groups for a couple weeks now, been raiding most
of the time, and I'm getting antsy about reaching 52 at least.

A friend suggested Velketor's, and from what I've heard that's a good
place to be right now, but it's also pretty crowded.... Of course,
Fear kiting isn't an option in there =p


Any help appreciated,

Rune
