Visit the SAFEHOUSE, Back Alley - big thread.
THEY WILL BE DOING CASTERS NEXT, EVEN SAID IT'S MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD TO DO
THEM, SO THEY DID MELEES FIRST.

Quotes from Abashi (or that other guy) and Kendrick.

Be warned, there are a number of rogues disappointed in the way that this
will effect our utility in groups.
    * We'll still do more damage, but the margin lessens again.
    * A hybrid class (RNG) is given triple attack before all pure melees get
it.

Other points were chewed over, I just mentioned the two which I'm keeping my
eye on.

I'm glad that the other classes are getting beefed, just hope they evaluate
it a *little* more before putting it into play.
