Yep, but make sure you're getting the right Athlon.  Speaking to a 
hardware vendor yesterday he mentioned that AMD dropped the prices without 
informing their retailers, leaving a lot of inventory that cost more for 
the store than they can sell it for now.  Unscrupulous vendors *may* 
misrepresent some AMD chips.  Intel tells suppliers before they change the 
pricing.

About $125 for each 512mb chip.  It's cheap, and absolutely worth buying 
as much as you can afford.

I'm using the KT333 based chipset, supposed to be faster, but if you're 
looking to maximize value, KT266 should be dropping in price.  ($150)

Currently using the audio on my motherboard, but based on the poor 
performance, I will be installing the Turtle Beach this weekend ($60).

I would actually recommend checking out pricing on GeForce4 ti4200/4400.  
The 4600 is almost $400, the 4400 is well under $300.  Stay away from 
GeForce 4 MX, it's just a souped up GeForce 2.

Look at the IBM Deskstar 120GXP.  As fast as anything on the market and 
$120 for an 80Gig.  Not for server use, but it's IDE.

Hmmm, that's a great price.  I know I paid $90 for a mid-tower with a 400W 
powersupply.  Chassis is the one part that is almost never worth mail 
order.  The shipping costs are too high compared to the purchase price.
