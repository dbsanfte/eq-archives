-Way I see it leveling quick isn't a big secret, it's all about being 
-efficient. No downtime, no idle chit chat between pulls, either
fighting 
-or pulling. Perhaps FD when the mob starts to run and let you partner
-finish the mob off while you're getting a new one. Keep your partner
on 
-kei at all times and make sure he uses extra mana for nukes or dots. 
-Stay away from anything that's light blue, hardly gives any exp (I 
-didn't realize how extremely little they give until rather recently, 
-never ever exp off light blues!!). Don't invite more people into the 
-group than there are mobs to kill, no point in having lots of dps
when 
-you have to wait for mobs to spawn. Casters need to watch their mana,
-make sure it's never at 100%. They also need to know which spells are
-most mana efficient. Avoid places that are too crowded. Dungeon exp 
-bonuses help if you can handle the dungeon (which you probably can
since 
-you can FD pull). Stuff like that.
-
-One of the reasons I suggest a duo is that it's easier to get 2
people 
-to work together well than it is with 6. Another reason is that
you'll 
-never run out of spawns (in most places at least).
-
-Might seem a bit trivial to some people but thinking back I realize
that 
-it was in my 40s I even started thinking about stuff like that. Chain
-pulling in groups was rare in groups at lower levels for example. Now
at 
-higher levels most groups work efficiently but for me this is
something 
-that has come gradually from around my 40s.
-
-Remember to have some fun sometimes too :) ..


yeah... that has been something i have noticed that last while... lots
of chit chat between pulls... groups not really working together well
and such...

It does become quite tedious at times but I have not problems with
that.

Unfrotunatly I have no 60+ characters... hehe 43 is my highest. 

I would like to thank everyone for their input. I hope I will be among
the 50+ masses soon :)
