If you are new to the game - I strongly urge you not to PL. I know you
didnt want to hear this, but if you advance quickly, you really dont
learn how to play the character. That and your casting skills will
fall behind quickly, so that if you are playing and not getting PL'd
at some point, you will get very frustrated because your spells will
fizzle constantly.
