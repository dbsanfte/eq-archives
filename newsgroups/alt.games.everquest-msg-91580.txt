    Ye underestimate us, lad. Dwarves make some of the best clerics,
paladins, and rogues in the game in terms of starting stats. Dwarven
warriors ain't slouches either (lack of Bash is the biggest strike against
us - the stats are quite close to a Barbarian). And dwarves have quite
possibly some of the best support in terms of newbie quests in the entire
game. If you're willing to make a semi-hazardous run to the docks you can
even get a pet at level one, regardless of class. :-) Plus, and Orlun can
back me up on this....

combat roll > all.
