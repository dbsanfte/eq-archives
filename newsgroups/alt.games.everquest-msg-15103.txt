Why start with rat sandwiches? Or sandwiches at all? Edible goo,
batwing/spider crunchies, several kinds of steak (stat food!), even
rat kabobs (require skewers, but they are also triv 26 and have stats)
are all perfectly acceptable starting alternatives to sandwiches that
don't require bread.

I am tempted to get my dark elf a spit, dump practice points in
baking, and have her run around with the spit and a supply of sauces,
spice and frosting when she gets older, just for the fun of cooking up
whatever meat she loots. But she won't be running around with bread.
