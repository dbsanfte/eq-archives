So then WHY is this an issue for you if you are not jelous of such rights ?

But the fact that the cop is *not* gay is an issue for you.
In your mind, a gay cop would *not* have any special rights
that he didn't deserve, and *thats* the problem *I* have.



> And yes, there were a whole bunch of gay cops in the pride parade.  

And do *they* have special rights?  If you think so, what is your point ??

So what the fuck, do these cops have labels on their uniforms that say
which are gay, and which are not ??  For someone who was so much
"equality", your sure like this whole segregation thing, don't you ?

Gay, or non-gay ?
