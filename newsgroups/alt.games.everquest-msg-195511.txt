40K and lots of different types to twink............

Twinking will let you level faster, but not the same as being power leveled,
so you may want to look for gear for one character that may be usable by
other characters you think you might like.
Simple things to keep in mind.
Melee get FAST weapons and HP bonus items AC is capped early anyway. (And
one of each weapon type they can use)
Casters get MANA gear and HP gear. Early on mana gear is a better buy then
+casting stat items.

I would spend a smaller amount (say 10K) and twink out one character and
play em for a while and see how you like it. The nice thing here is this
gear will almost always sell back to someone for close to cost. Spend the
rest once you decide on a main character.

I have twinked and PL characters with no skill problems. You just need to be
aware of where your skills are and maybe NOT cast the damage shield this
time. Or use the lower damage but fast weapon for lots of swings and skill
ups.
