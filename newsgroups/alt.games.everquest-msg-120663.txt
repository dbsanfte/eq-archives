I know what it's worth *to me*. I don't offer more, and don't see why I
should.

Oddly enough, I *do* offer all my porting money up front. And I ask long
before I *see* the porter if the "donation" is acceptable. It has nothing
to do with me thinking ports are "really worth more", and everything to
do with being courteous. For the 3 ports I've taken, I've paid 5pp, 10pp,
and (8gp+Fer'esh). No one has ever turned down my porting donations. C'est
la vie.

No. I can "afford" 600pp for a flask of water. Once. But no way in hell
would I ever pay that much. In addition, my apparent wealth often has
nothing to do with my actual wealth. My level 12 halfling warrior was given
a Rygorr Breastplate by a passing stranger, but she'd have had to sell it
off to get 10pp for a port -- not worth it.


>Sounds like porter envy to me.

It is, to some extent: porting's a nice ability. But it's also reaction
to porter arrogance. "We DESERVE to become filthy rich, as risk-free,
effortless parasites, and you will grovel at our uberness". Whatever.


>"My class is forced to pay you for it

Hyeah, right. I'm not pretending. It's often not worth 10pp for a
port for me. I can (and do) walk to luclin spires and use those,
for free. I can (and do) run to FV, fish while waiting for shuttle,
and take ship to Butcherblock. I'm not a very efficient player.
Ten plat is often more than I can make in a night, while I can
travel almost anywhere in the world in under an hour. Two plat
*is* what a port is worth to me. Excuse my non-uberness.


>If the going rate offends you so

The "going rate" is whatever is accepted. Sometimes that's 10pp,
sometimes it's 8gp+lame loot. Deal with it.

You are wrong. I've watched the /shouts and /auctions roll by in gfay of
wizards and druids offering to port to some alphabet soup of destinations
for 10pp. On one of the few occasions where I was interested taking up a
"port for donation" I asked if 2pp is enough and was told "yes". And I got
my port. There *are* druids out there who simply aren't as greedy as you.
The "worth" of a port is what is accepted at the time. No more, no less.
