    "I'm tired of answering stupid questions asking me what my gear does
when all the stats in the world are on Allakhazam's." "I'm tired of people
seeing I have good gear then pestering me for cash / items / services." "If
someone can inspect me and see I'm wearing a class-specific piece of armour,
they can get around the /anon I have up just to screen out class-specific
beggar tells."

    What exactly would be the difference between wanting a /noinspect flag
and the /anon flag we have now, again? Both say that you don't want to
interract with SOMEONE - /anon is directed mostly at people out of sight of
you, /noinspect would be at someone within sight of you. I don't care - I
turned off my inspection messages a long time ago, and don't use /anon. But
is there much of a difference in the motivations behind both?

    The real problem is unwanted tells from strangers. It would be nice for
those people who wish to screen tells to have a chat filter option to screen
out all people who aren't either guilded with you, grouped with you, or on
your friends list. But I imagine that would be annoying to code and would
cause even more headaches.
