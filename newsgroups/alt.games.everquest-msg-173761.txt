> This Bazaar you guys are talking about, where about is it actually ?

It's a large zone on Luclin where you can buy bags, put the stuff you 
want to sell into those bags, price the items, and walk away from the 
computer while your person is in trader mode.  People can search for 
your items or come and browse what you're selling personally, and if 
they want to buy it, it will automatically take the money from them and 
put it on you, and give them the item.  Be careful, though - the special 
bags you have to buy (about a plat and change each, so be warned) weight 
25 pounds EACH.  Weight doesn't matter in the Bazaar, but it does in 
Shadowhaven and The Nexus, the zones connected to the Bazaar.  If you 
zone out and are too overweight, you won't be able to move, and you'll 
have to get someone to help you.

> So would you just go to the bazaar and start shouting "spiderling
> silks for sale, 3pp each" ?

Nope, see above.  In fact, shouting can get you in trouble.  Auctioning 
is allowed (although not spammed auctioning) but really, people can find 
the silks by searching for them if they need them, so it's not 
necessary.

I'm assuming you're a human ranger then ;p Try East Commons as well - 
those spiderlings usually have a generous drop rate, and tracking makes 
it easier.  Feerott has the bonus of ALL its spiders dropping spiderling 
silks (as opposed to spider silks), but the ogre bouncers won't like 
you.  If you can learn where they hang around and avoid them though, 
it's a perfectly safe place to hunt and gather quite a few.

> Also another poster once said something about robo traders ? How do
> you set yourself up to become a robo trader ?

Again, see the first paragraph.  But first, do you have Shadows of 
Luclin and/or Planes of Power?  SoL is required to use the Bazaar, and 
PoP will make getting there WAY easier, especially if you're hanging 
around Qeynos at the moment.
