I've started and seen this discussion started a few times on here about duo
classing, but had a new idea and thought I'd run it by everyone.  My
girlfriend and I are gonna be starting two characters together and leveling
them together.  We had originally thought Shaman/Warrior, then arrived at
Druid/Chanter (me playing druid, her enchanter) but just recently I decided
that I think I'd be bored playing a druid and decided to try Shadow Knight
and Chanter, both Dark Elf.  What does everyone think about this duo?  What
drawbacks will there be?  Just curious about what your input might be, and
figure it might make a nice distraction from all the discussion and
complaining about the new patches.  ;)
