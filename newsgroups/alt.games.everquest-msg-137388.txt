Most likely not.  A criminal probably isn't going to get a firearm
registered, especially one that is going to be traced back to him.  Or, do
you think the same guy who has no qualms about using a gun to rob and kill
is going to say "Hey, I've got to register this, it's the law."

Actually, the U.S. has nuclear bombs.  And the principle of strategic
deterrence not only worked throughout the cold war, but helped win it.

I'm not sure what to say about this.  It's actually so absurd that it's
difficult to get a handle on.  You seem to think the presence of a firearm
automatically means it's going to be used.  It's about simple common sense,
which much of America _does_ have, believe it or not.  OTOH, the gun
grabbers don't seem to figure it in.  Here's a simple rule.  If you're in a
situation where the possiblity of killing someone becomes a neccessity (ie,
you're being robbed at gun or knife point), then the gun is the safest way
for you to do so.  One of the first things I was taught when I was learning
to handle a gun is that you never point it at something you don't intend to
shoot.

Those two facts are clear examples, and there are many, many more.  There
are examples of attempted Columbine-type situations put to an end because
the principal kept a gun.  The statistics show that a firearm is much more
likely to be used to thwart a crime, than commit it.

> A decent gun-carrier is an oxymoron. A gun-carrier is a moron.

And now we get into the baseless personal attacks.  You can't win on
statisics, you can't win on philosophical debate, so you resort to calling
names.  There are many decent gun-carriers.  Take your local
law-enforcement, for example.  Or you sailor standing guard at the head of
Pier 11 in Norflok (I know, I've been there).  And, yes, even your private
citizens are good gun carriers.  And those gun owners who you cry are
morons, may be the ones you're depending on to save your life.  Still, if
you're going to make that claim, I'd like to see a study comparing gun owner
IQ's to that of the unarmed.

"If guns cause crime, mine are broken."  -- Ted Nugent

> This year's "reluctant hero" is next year's "homicidal maniac".

Another line of bullshit.  Again, you're assuming that guns cause the crime.
How about Mac the Knife, one of the earlies serial killers in the general
public knowledge?  That "homicidal maniac" didn't use a firearm, even though
they existed at the time.  Clearly, there isn't a correlation between guns
and homicidal maniacs.

You're trying to paint the picture that all law-abiding gun owners are just
moments away from snapping, and going on a killing spree.  That just isn't
the case.

Really?  I was under the impression that home invasions and back-alley rapes
still happened.  Why is it you think banning firearms is going to disarm
those who are willing to rape and kill in the first place?

Really...?  Setting aside the fact that the world was known to be round,
even in Columbus's day (that was known since the first mariners noted the
curvature of the horizon), do you really think that the colonial Americans
hadn't realized that they were on a new continent by the time the Revolution
was fought?

Both of those aside, can you refute the argument, or just try to attack
those making it?

That's a nicely contrived situation.  I like at the end, how you turn him
into a racist, and you have him committ what is clearly homocide (killing
the reader for being a busybody).  You are aware that there are laws on the
books against homicide, are you not?

If he acted without reason, then it's homicide, whether or not he used a
gun.  Maybe the racist, little, old, jewish man (nice that you made him a
jew while you were at it, do you hate jews as much as gun owners?) had a
knife, and stabbed the 220 lbm black man in the heart.  Would that be any
less homicidal?

> It is a moot point whether "honest citizens" believe they should carry

As long as we live in a republic, it _isn't_ a moot point.  Or do you think
it's your divine right to draft legislation, regardless of what the governed
think?  Your calling it a "moot point" shows an extreme arrogance on your
part.  What do you think the principle of "consent of the governed" is all
about?

> It is a moot point whether "honest citizens" believe that anyone should
have

You could just simplify that to "It is a moot point whether 'honest
citizens' believe that anyone should have choice."  I like how you put
quotation marks around "honest citizens."  It shows that you don't seem to
think there is such a thing.

All through your post, you fail to even address the points being made, and
instead attack those who made the points.  Then, you throw in personal
attacks against gun owners in general.  After all that, you clearly state
that you take the fact that those who disagree with you (by suggesting that
your belief is incorrect) as a personal attack.  Couple that with your bit
about "moot points" and honest citizens, it seems that you are a very
confused person.  Which college is it that broke you?
