}At least you'd be doing better than my in-laws. When we told them I was
}pregnant with child #1 they informed me that if i ever used "any of that
}psychobabble shit" on their grandchild they'd sue for custody.

Eeew... at least I can't imagine they'd win.  They sound so openminded.  
But then, not getting along with the in-laws is practically traditional.

}> Now hang on, that's kinda circular... It sounds like you're defining the
}> result of the process in terms of the prcess that leads to it.   But what
}> exactly is it that's supposed to theoretically -happen- when they reach
}> that level?
}That's the thing, you never "reach" anything.  Self-actualization, according
}to Maslow, is a continual process of learning and growing.  You can always
}learn more about yourself, you can always learn more about the world around
}you, you are always progressing in your knowledge of the world.

So after reading some of those links...  I got the impression from one of 
them that self-actualization was really just another need to be filled, 
and not like the goal at the top of the pyramid.  That kinda makes more 
sense, I think.  But then there needs to be some other name for 'striving 
to get to a higher level of the pyramid'.  One thing that seems weird to 
me is the idea of this as a heirarchy... It seems like there are cases 
when a lower need becomes subservient to a higher need somehow.  Best 
example I can think of is anorexia, where hunger gets pushed aside in 
favor of a need to feel attractive or... get attention?  I may not be 
understanding anorexia too well. :) But it definitely seems to involve a 
need (albeit perhaps an unhealthy one) from some higher stage 
circumventing the lower hunger stage.

}> }> Is 'self-actualization' quantifiable in some way?
}> }Unfortunately, as is the nature with many aspects of the social sciences,
}> }something like this is very very very difficult to test empirically.
}> Well, that sounds lke a step toward it being.  If we can correlate 'makes
}> a great advance' with 'self-actualized', then we can at least assign it a
}> value of 0 or 1. :)
}unfortuantely the world of social sciences tends to move away from
}quantifiable numbers.  In my statistics courses we used terms like
}"statistically significant percentage of difference.

Heh, but... a statistic is a quantifiable number... :)  Yes, you do tend 
to end up with only correlative results, really, and not causative, but at 
least it's something. :)  I just wanna know what n was, and what the 
standard deviation was, and how well it correlated. :)

}Welcome to my world.  I have these thoughts about these little theories and
}studies and teatieses all the time -- often in the most bizaare places.

Your world?  Sounds like we're neighbors. :)

}Another gentleman who thought along these lines was Fredrich Froebel
}(http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-froeb.htm).  Froebel, in addition to
}believing that education involved steps to be progressed upon when the
}individual was ready, also believed very strongly in "hands-on" learning.

Hmm, not much theory here, more biographical.  But hey, he invented 
kidneygarden, gotta love him. :)

}> }Further, IMO Maslow would think along the lines that if the basic needs
}> }of love, sex, and self-esteem were being met, such things as overt 
}> }PDA's would not be necessary.
}> Hmm... I mostly buy that.  I suspect a lot of people really enjoy PDAs
}> though (exhibitionism), so I'm not sure how that fits in with 'necessary'.
}> Or is experiencing enjoyment necessarily fulfilling a need?
}For the most part, PDA's are there to fulfill either an exteme need for
}affection (the individual cannot wait to have their need met due to some
}feeling that they won't have another chance) or an extreme need for
}attention.  If both of these needs are met on a regular basis in a more
}positive situation, the need for the PDA ceases.

A thing that's bothering me a bit about Maslow's theory is that it gets 
right back to that determinism vs. free will dialectic.  If everything 
we're doing is based on satisfying needs, it seems like it very much 
restricts choice somehow.  Heh, perhaps my desire to do things 'just 
because' is somehow satisfying one of -my- needs...

So I guess where we're at is, if we have a pesonality trait (which we 
presume to be immutable) like an addictive personality, or exhibitionistic 
tendencies, or a sexuality, then it sort of gets added to the pile of 
needs in some way, and we have to choose whether it should be added 
directly as a need (genetics as excuse), or whether it should be added as 
something we need to overcome (genetics as warning).  Does that sound 
about right?  And I guess the choice would depend on how we perceive the 
costs and benefits of that need in either case both for ourselves and 
possibly, depending on which Kohlbergian stage we think from, the costs 
and benefits to society.

I wonder if the Kohlbergian stages form a similar sort of pyramid that 
interplays with the Maslov pyramid in some way, ie, if it's a stage one 
Maslovian need, we won't go nearly as high on the Kohlberg scale with 
it in terms of eedig a 'moral justification'.  And on the other hand, we 
might forego our higher level needs if they conflict with a higher 
Kohlberg stage.  

}> Links good.  Me like links. :)
}you asked for links....here's links:
}http://web.utk.edu/~gwynne/maslow.HTM
}http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/bhmasl.html

Did you play the 'That's My Theory!' game linked a the end of this one?  
That was kinda fun. :)

}low.htm

"Beyond these needs, higher levels of needs exist."  Wow, like what, I 
wonder?

}here's more kohlberg
}http://freiheit.syntheticdimension.net/views-morality.shtml

Man, this guy (the site author, not Kohlberg) is a total downer.  Presents 
everything in terms of what's wrong with people like that instead of 
what's right.

Did the little game thing here work for you?  The turnover button didn't 
seem to work.

Wow, the second page of this, where it gets into Gilligan's theories on 
gender-differentiated moral development, is really cool.  So -that's- why 
I'll never understand women.  Now I get it. :)  And the pages after that 
are some interesting personality tests, I always enjoy those.  In light of 
the current thread, the second page of tests cracked me up. :)

}piaget
}http://tip.psychology.org/piaget.html (this one has some of that empirical
}stuff for you)

lol, not really. :) At least not at that link.  This TIP database is 
pretty cool though.  Quick summaries of tons of learning theories.  Very 
handy.  Some of the stuff on Constructivism looked vaguely relevant in 
some way.
