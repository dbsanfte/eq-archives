The theory is everyone is selling off stuff and hoarding cash to buy the new
Luclin items when they arrive.  It's happened before with expansions, but
it's more noticable now as there's more stuff to sell and more people
selling it.

Of course, it also means people are likely going to be paying wildly
inflated prices for luclin goodies the first few weeks (since there will be
an abundance of cash in the system).
