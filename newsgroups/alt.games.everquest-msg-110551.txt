INT?  You'd spend the equivalent of three levels worth of work getting
3 more INT?  When Run, and First Aid are all available in the same
"you have to spend 6 points here" tier?

Recall that INT over 200 results only in 5 points of mana per... this
is 30 points of mana you are talking about.  I doubt there will be one
instance in a thousand fights where that 30 mana is going to make any
difference to a level 50+ character.  And I doubt seriously that there
is a 50+ necromancer on all the Norraths who isn't equipped up to at
least 200 INT.
