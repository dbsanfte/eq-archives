Laugh.

I OWN a software development company with Fortune 100 clients.  If
Sony were one I would have already called the CEO.

What nonsense.  W95 was costing them money in support and development
costs with its wierd mishmash of hardware configs and drivers.  They
could continue to support all that or dump it for directx.  Guess what
they chose?
KEI costs them nothing and can be unnerfed tommorrow.

I don't know why it took them so long to "fix" but then you don't know
either.
