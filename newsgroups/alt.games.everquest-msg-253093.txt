    I also don't think that I have it in me to play two MMORPG's either.  I
rolled up a baby druid on MT, and went through the tutorial (nice charm!)
and killed a couple of rats in Qeynos (Got a plague tail!).  But I can't
say that I really enjoyed myself.  I kept hitting the keys to jump, and
wondering why I wasn't clearing trees.  And the graphics just looked very,
um... not good to me.  On the other hand, I remembered how much I miss the
serverwide chat channels.

   Overall, though, I think I may just be simply be ruined for EQ.  /sigh
