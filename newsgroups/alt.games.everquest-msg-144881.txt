congat's you just opened up you compleat network to the outside world.  If
you have multiple computers running EQ then I can understad this approach,
but if not, you are better off just putting one computer in the DMZ and
runnig a good firwall program. ZoneAlarm is free and does a great job of
this.  If you had a narower list of ports that EQ need's then I could see
doing part of this.

1.  Don't turn off Stateful Packet Inspection...  It only plocks mall coded
packets.  Your not going to get any from Veriant.

2.  Don't turn "block Wan Request" off.  that is what keep's your network
private.  When  some one is sniffing port's they only see the Router whit
this on, not all the computers behind it.

3.  By opening all those ports up you are making it easy for those kids with
port sniffers to get access to your computer.

Please People don't do what He ask's.  You will regret it later on.  And if
you haven't already done it get a firewall program.  The router is good at
blocking incoming, but it can't help you if you have a trojan on your
system..  It will let everything out, just not let everything in.

Hope enough people see this in time.
