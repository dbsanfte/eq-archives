The Cobalt Scar key was not quite that simple, as you needed a key to get 
out of Skyshrine into Cobalt Scar.  In order to get the key you needed to 
either kill an NPC in Skyshrine, or perform a quest.  Not to mention, 
prior to ingame maps, just the run through Kael could be interesting for 
someone who is not familiar with it, not to mention the confusing maze 
that is Skyshrine.
