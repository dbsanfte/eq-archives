    Aggro kiting is inefficient compared with fear kiting - I'd have to 
apply more obnoxious DoTs with weaker efficiency, like Asystole or Plague, 
and lose a fair chunk of the med time. I plan to fear kite for as long as 
possible, then switch to aggro kiting some time after 56 when I get 
Cessation of Cor, a reasonably efficient debuff DoT, and Demilich for mana 
regen.

    Both shamans and necromancers, in my experience, have an "I win" spell. 
If my necromancer lands snare, I win. If my shaman (now level 49) lands 
Togor's, I win.
