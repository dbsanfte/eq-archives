Well, as far as I've ever been able to determine, you actually have to be
DOING something.  "MOM!  Billy's LOOKING at me again!" isn't harassment.

I don't think that standing next to a critter and not moving or saying
anything is harassment.

I also doubt if it's in the rules anywhere that says someone can't pick
pocket to their heart's content, but I'm as lazy as you...I don't feel like
going hunting to see if I'm right or not. :)
