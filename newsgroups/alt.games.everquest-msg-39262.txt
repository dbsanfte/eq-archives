This was covered a while back but the deal is this;

Scenario;
Primary Hand Bladed Thulien Claws 5/19
Secondary Hand Silvery War Axe 6/22

The Claws in his/her Primary hand WILL swing every 1.9 seconds. They will
hit only on the result of a successful attack.
The Axe in the secondary hand WILL make a Dual Wield skill test to see if
they swing every 2.2 seconds and will only swing on a successful one and
then obviously only hit on a successful attack test.

Now lets work on the Warriors Favourite, Wurmy and Yak.
Wurmy in the primary hand swings every 4 seconds but the Yak makes and
attempt to swing every 2.4 secs and will hit first if all the skill tests
are successful.

Your secondary weapon is governed only by the delay of that weapon and not
by anything else.

The reason I think people get confused is when they are lower levels (than
you or I) and so the Dual wield test is less successful, also it's not until
35th (I believe, feel free to correct me) that Dual wield will also effect
your secondary hand (and so you can quad hit). Plus, most people use 2
slashing or 2 piercing weapons, early on. Try a fast piercer off hand and
watch as you pierce first in many of your attacks.

The secondary weapon never hits as often as it has to make 2 skill tests to
hit, one just swing.
