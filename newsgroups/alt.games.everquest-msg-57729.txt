Ignoring the obvious start (club, clad, etc.) and the
ones that involve a silent trailing "c" (ventricle, etc.),
that still leaves us with such words as:

Aclinic
Anaclisis
Balaclava
Chanticleer
Circlet
Conclusion
Cyclic
Cyclamate
Cyclamen
Declaration
Eclipse
Eclectic
Nuclear
Recluse
Seclusion

Etc.

Even the "ucli" sequence appears in English
only as "Euclidean" (and variants) and "nuclide",
both of which are pronounced with a hard "c".

In fact, except for "muscle", I couldn't find any
"cl" combination where the "c" was pronounced as
an "s" (and even in that one, it's more proper to
say that the "c" is silent and the "s" takes
precedence).

Which words were *you* thinking of which lends
credence to the idea that "Luclin's 'c' should be
pronounced as an 's'"?
