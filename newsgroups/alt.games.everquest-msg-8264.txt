Doesn't seem to be too much of a drawback about losing the guildnote. If you
have made it to lvl 5 then you have probably outgrown the use of the the
clothing you get from the guild. I think the only way to get another note is
to re-start the character.

Everlore is a good resource for quest information. This link lists them by
zone, but there are other search criteria;
