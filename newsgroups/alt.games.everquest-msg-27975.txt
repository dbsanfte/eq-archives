well, yeah, but clarity and haste are probably justification enough to
include them along... although, I woudln't put them ahead of the bard,
who can fill in both roles as well as adding some respectable amounts
of damage.

That being said, I'd put Shaman below both, as the 'chanter can haste
better than the shammy, and most of the stat buffs are pretty
worthless.  Although it's being reported that Avatar might have some
use.

If going against a Velious mob, the Wizard probably has a pretty good
spot with his Bane line of spells.  A shame that's one of the very
very few instances in which he's going to be of any use at all.
