I've had people call me n00b who were Ebayers... it's sick. I mean, my
highest character at the moment is 18, but I've been as high as 31, have
been playing for almost 2 years, and know a lot about higher levels simply
because all my school friends are in their fifties. But they Ebay'd, they
are level 60, so I'm the n00b...

Some people have such GREAT logic.... it astounds me.
