    This is one of the Big Lies in Everquest: the idea that during the beta
for an expansion, the devs carefully tune an encounter so that it will just
be beatable given the upgraded gear obtained in lesser encounters. This lie
is propagated by Furor because he is a personal friend of many of the old
devs, and doesn't want to admit the truth: beta testing in EQ is crap.

    Look at every description of beta testing you've ever seen written
about. Veeshan's Peak, beta: they threw a raid force in pre-Kunark gear and
level 60 in there and they were eaten alive first encounter. Working as
intended, never tested again. The original Bristlebane: threw 36 people at
it in Kunark gear, everyone was smoked, working as intended, never tested
again. All they're checking is that a random group of people with gear from
the last expansion get murdered the first time they encounter a mob - that
isn't tuning! That's making sure the new content isn't trivial straight from
the box! If they *actually* "tuned" these encounters a lot of the problems
and near-exploits we find when we do them just wouldn't be there. Sitting
down in a room and comparing the theoretical healing per second with the DPS
of the target mob and the theoretical DPS of a target raid is not tuning.

    Depends on how the improved focus effects are done. If it's tuned so
certain slots are expected focus effect slots, like "bracers are nuke
modifiers", then it'll be incorporated into future loot design. You get much
the same effect with melees and haste - by and large haste comes from waist
or back slot items, so melees reserve those slots. (Which is why our melees
turn into total lootwhores every time someone mentions going to Umbral to do
Doomshade - "Ooooh, the earring!!!")
