I don't know about AO, but, while DAoC may have better graphics, it's
hurting from an artistic aspect.  The character designs, at least on the
elves, are horrid.  EQ is better in many aspects (though is it too much to
ask that Half Elves get a long hair option???), though they still have
issues in places.  It's sad that they put all the money into the modeling
technology, but not in the artists to render the characters.

At this rate, I'm really hoping Ragnarok Online matures.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
