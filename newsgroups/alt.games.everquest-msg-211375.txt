and to throw in my own 2 cents.....

i played a war to 50, then passed the gear down to my ranger

at 35, in dsp, my warrior was doing a noticeably better job tanking than my
ranger

and what's funny is it seems that my warrior gets hit less

war is a barb, ranger is an elf....all gear is the same except for neck and
neck

important stats are 150-180 . . not a super twink here...regen bp....war
could kill around 20-40% more [blue] mobs before downtime

but rangers don't suck at tanking, i'm just saying the difference is obvious
