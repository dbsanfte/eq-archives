Yeah, I did my first mult kite at Tizmats too. By accident. got a
couple adds, and figured what the heck, sat down and memmed lightning
strike.  Quaded the rest of the night :)

Goes thru mana fast, sometimes run out and have to med kite to get
enough juice for last one.  I really hate when they are almost dead,
running away or whatever and snare wears off.. arggg..

Favorite is to get with a enchanter that has gravity flux.  they start
at about half or less, run in straight line with you. hardly any
downtime, and they stay aggroed on you.
