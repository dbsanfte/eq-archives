A Shaman can do fine with low starting wis:

As for SK...don't they get the Necro spells that convert HP to mana?
Combine that with a Troll's regen, and you are a happy SK, possibly as happy
or happier than those of other races who might have higher int.  Their
higher int gives them a bigger mana pool, but you have one that you can
regenerate faster.  What that means is that there might be some things that
they can do that you can't, but for things that you can both do, you can do
it more efficiently.  That usually wins.
