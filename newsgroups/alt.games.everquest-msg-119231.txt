I noticed when I logged in earlier that the server screen now says 3
expansions enabled, before it was just expansions enabled. I presume that
PoP is imminent for release.
And did anyone get an email from VI offering a free account number as an
incentive to start a new account. See below

Cut/Paste

"Open up new solo gameplay possibilities you've only dreamed about. Got two
computers? Use the free account key provided in this email and your existing
software to start a second account and play two characters together -- at
the same time! How cool would it be to build a cleric or druid of your own
and have them at your fingertips for buffs, healing and more? Or better yet,
get a friend to join you by giving him or her this free account key. Now
your friend has no excuse not to come adventure with you. Or even better
still, invite a family member. Remember, the family that plays together
stays together."

I don't know the opinion of this group on the issue of PLing but it seems to
be officially indorced by VI now, even if it wasn't before.
