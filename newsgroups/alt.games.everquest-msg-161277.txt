My son has got one of his 8 spell jewels assigned to open and close his
spellbook. This means he can only have 7 spells memmed at one time, and I
want to fix that, but I can't figure out how to get rid of the control-B
symbol there and replace it with a spell. Tried right-clicking,
hold-clicking, memming a spell over it, etc. How do I do this?
