You're talking about pre-nerf logs, not something which stayed live
for very long.  I've got a 56 cleric and I log all my characters.
My cleric's DPS against greens isn't anywhere near as high as my 39
monk's against whites and yellows.  And there's absolutely no way
he out-damages a 56th melee.

Lance posted a current log not long ago.  His DPS was under 18, IIRC.
That's for a 60th cleric.  What's your DPS again?
