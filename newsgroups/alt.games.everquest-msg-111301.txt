Actually, it was my understanding that the reason behind the attempted
wipe was rampant twinking and PLing making for a rather poor
environment for testing changes made for the lower-end game. It also
makes it impossible to test the effect certain changes would have on
the "natural" progression of characters.

Personally, I still disagree with the backlash. You're playing on a
test environment, and as such, it is naturally unstable. Common sense
should have made it obvious that a player wipe on a test environment
is a very real possibility.
