The buff icons for chanter haste and potion haste may stack, but the haste 
effect does not.

I know that my haste spells will stack with chanter haste, but, the haste 
effects do not stack.

Anyway, you can have one each of worn haste, spell haste, song overhaste.  
Potion counts as spell haste.

And grats on your epic.
