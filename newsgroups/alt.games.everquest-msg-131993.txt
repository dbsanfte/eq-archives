I don't know what his reasons are, but here are things I dislike about
Microsoft.

1. They favor certain big software companies over the little companies.
It's damn hard to compete against, say, Symantec, when they get access to
better Microsoft documentation than I do.

2. Large parts of Windows are undocumented.  A large reason that so many 3rd
party drivers cause stability problems is that the people writing the
drivers didn't have documentation.  I wrote a driver for a CD controller for
Win9x, and to find out what certain control calls were supposed to do, I had
to spend a couple of months disassembling the multimedia system, and
single-stepping through it in Soft-ICE.

3. They put features into the system without considering the consequences.
Compare the frequency of viruses on Windows and the damage they cause to any
other system.  Even taking into account that the popularity of Windows makes
it a bigger target, Windows comes out way behind everything else.  This can
be pretty directly traced to poor design of Microsoft's web and email
applications.

4. Poor following of standards.

There are more, but those are the biggies.
