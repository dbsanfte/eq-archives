Trust me, you don't want dragons.

I swear, if I hear one more dragon bitching "Just look at me!  I'm five
times as big as a gnome, I should have five times the carrying capacity!
I'm huge... each claw swing should do hundreds if not thousands of points of
damage, assuming I don't decide to incenerate my foes with a moment of
dragon breath."...  I may kill someone.

In Horizons the dragons aren't much more than flying lizards. They can't be.
Because if they were "true dragons", they would be so ungodly powerful that
they would destroy any semblence of balance among the players within the
game.    If you think EQ would be a mess to balance races...  try it after
they add a race whose players truly believe that they *should* be 5-30 times
more powerful than every other player, just from clicking "Dragon" at
character creation. (1)


(1) Which is not to say that dragons in Horizons dont' have serious balance
issues and need improvement... but from the way they bitch, even if the HZ
staff does finally manage to make them equal to the other race/class
combinations, a lot of them won't be close to happy with that.
