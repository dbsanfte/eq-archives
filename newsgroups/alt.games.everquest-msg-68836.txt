As with all patches, this one causes problems too.
At least for me

The whole luclin patching extravaganza hasn't caused any trouble for me so
far. Everything worked (I don't have velious or luclin), no worries. There
was woo and certainly hoo.

Untill today, now I too can no longer reach the character select screen. I
have tried deselecting everything, caching and low res options. It just
doens't work. Crash to desktop and burn horribly.

More people with this? No solution yet I gather?
