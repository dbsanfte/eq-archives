I'd like to attend one of these but I have a question.  Do any non-geeky
types attend? <g>

I'm sorry but dressing up in costumes and roleplaying in real life would
just be too much for me.  I am assuming that the people that attend these
faires are in the higher end of the age range (because of the expense)?  Do
they have sections setup for different servers?

I do think it would be cool to talk about EQ experiences with other players.
None of my friends play and I don't know how many local players there are
here.
