On the bright side, you don't have to worry about getting your paladin
magic boots :) You will notice a considerable lack of str compared to
your warrior, though...

Those special holy/unholy tricks are nifty. I love my sk's harmtouch -
instant nuke, and unlike LoH there's no need to target myself :) Can't
wait till I get time to really play my alts and get my first lifetap
spell... and you might not get kick, but at least you get to bash. Get
a shield and a 1h weapon at level 6 and you have your substitute for
kick :)
