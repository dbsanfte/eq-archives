Thanks for your reply, that's what I noticed too when I tried to register to
the newsletter.
I've tried to mail directly the customer service, maybe they can do
something ?

Or maybe someone who had the free account but don't expect to use it at all
could spare it ? It will be well used and make my wife happy (We play DAOC
this way, 2PCs and 2 accounts as you can see ythis on
http://perso.wanadoo.fr/franckm/) but she'd like to try EQ in duo.

TIA,
