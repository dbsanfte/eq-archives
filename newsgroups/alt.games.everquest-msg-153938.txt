Oh I know exactly what you mean, but at the same time, I was chealing myself
last night in ST (2boxing of course) when one of the pullers trained my
cleric.  4 60+ (red con to 60) golems, flurrying, hitting hard, and i still
channeled DA.

Of course I promptly got slaughtered when DA ended, but thats another story
