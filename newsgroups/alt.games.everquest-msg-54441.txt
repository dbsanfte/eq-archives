There's many things you should never sacrifice for AC, however haste
isn't one of them.

The single absolute worst case senerio for this is using an FBSS
instead of a AC30 belt.  That's a delta of 30 raw AC which translates
to roughly 45 total AC.

45 total AC is about 3 to 5% damage delta depending on the mob you're
fighting.

That means for an additional 5% damage you take, you're generating 17%
more aggro.

See the math here?
