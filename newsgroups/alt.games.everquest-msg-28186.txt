Yeah, no one wanted it...*shrug*.

No tank would use a 16 AC head gear, and we don't have many monks.

Cowl is the same as CoFs.
AC is about 1000.  He doesn't have great armor, just RFV stuff and odd
pieces of dragonbone stuff.

Weapons are good.
Defiance and Frostbringer (again no one wanted them so...*shrug*).

However, remember I was the ONLY one doing damage.  The shaman didn't
want to summon a pet because he admitted he wasn't good at pet control
(which is fine).

I should NOT be able to outdamage a full group of players that
included rangers, warriors, and a mage.  And to be honest, I don't
think I did.  However, the difference was that their cleric couldn't
keep up with the mana needs of an unslowed mob.

My one shaman could.

Nope. 
You can completely neutre Turgur--mark the mobs 100% MR.
You can't do the same with Complete Heals.

Psst:  There's virtually NO boss mobs where turgur sticks.  The only
one that comes even remotely close is Dozekar.
