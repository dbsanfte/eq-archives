}No he's right there are many usenet groups that prefer top posting
}such as:
}alt.whiners
}alt.aardvark.sex
}alt.fanfic.rainbowbright.slash
}alt.my.little.poney.is.real
}There are many, many, more of course, those are just the most
}respected.

Being supremely bored, I actually checked.  Neither google nor my school 
server carry any of those groups, so they probably don't actually exist.  
alt.aardvark, however, was mostly single-post threads.  In the event of 
multiple-post threads, it seemed to be about 50% toppost, 50% no quoting 
at all, so we may have a winner!  alt.whine was entirely bottomposted (in 
my limited sample of 8-10 threads).
