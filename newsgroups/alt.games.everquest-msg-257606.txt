Celestial Healing at 44 does 720 for 225, factor in mana Preservation II 
focus and its 203. 720/203 = 3.54 hp/mana.

Complete Heal, 400 mana (unaffected by focus), to get to 3.54 hp/mana 
requires that you heal x/400=3.54 --> x=1416hp. 

At 45, my completely self equipped (no twinkage, no bazaar gear), with 
Temp, Eru SK has ~2400 hp. I usually get CH'd for 1500-2000 hps. Thus CH 
is better than HoT, around 20% better (based on an average CH of 1750.)

With a more 'average' tank, in twink/bazaar gear CH becomes even more 
efficient.

Or, as mentioned elsewhere, if sit regen is being utilized somewhat 
extensively.
