my girlfriend plays a 64 mage and has this exact conern (as well as a lot of
the others you've posted about, lance)

i'd like to tell you the same thing i told her, and maybe lightning will
strike twice....

she joined a group in the bastion of thunder, kind of the noob zone for PoP

south wing of the zone.....south middle / south pad camp spots (i'm sure the
names will differ by server, but the camps are always based around the rare
mobs)

if:

you can ignore the shouts and ooc's
you can dodge people trying to train you and KS your mobs
you have the patience to hang out for a few hours
you set up a group that can handle itself

THEN

you will get good drops off the rares, eventually.....in 5 hours, you should
see 2 or 3 pieces of ornate....prices can range from 5-45 kpp (on my server
....as a reference, CotAM will go for around 30k presently...was about 70k 6
months ago...hope that helps)

i wish you luck on rolling

before you ding 65, you will have however much you need to afford your
spell, i promise.....

my GF in one 5-ish hour group (at the south pad, a safe corner in south wing
next to the bees/stormwatcher teleport pad) she won the ornate bracer mold
and an ornate silk turban - the bracer will go for ~40k and is an easy swap
for her most important 65 spell, and the turban she'll probably use, but
will most likely swap for one of those spells that are probably equal in
value

sure, her luck was great and all, but *someone* will get the loot and in
enough time it will be you

this method is the only cash-gathering method that will give you xp while
you "work"

this method is also the fastest way to make cash, short of scamming,
hacking, buying PP with r/l money, or getting a donation from someone who
has left the game

i wish you luck, lance!
