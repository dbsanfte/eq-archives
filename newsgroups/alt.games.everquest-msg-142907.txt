Of course, you have to remember that when you see a level 3 running 
around in Innoruk's Bath Robe carrying Fay's Electric Mixer of Doom and 
doing 3525151234 points of damage to the orc pawns that are eating you 
for lunch... you are not a twink.  Yet.  People'll give you stuff but 
don't be surprised when you can't keep up with what everybody else owns.  
It sucks, but there it is.  And one day you, too, will be A Twink.

Ryou
(and they all lived happily ever after, except for the orc pawns)
