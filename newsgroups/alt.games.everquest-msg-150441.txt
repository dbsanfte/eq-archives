I never personally ran into Linvarwen, but he was in my guild for a day or
so.  It was rumored that he ebayed the char and moved on.  The new,
"improved" Linvarwen does not ask for help with his epic, does not d00d
speak and never lies about class/level.  Those 3 things are all sure signs
that you have the ex-Linvarwen.  The "I'll kill myself" quotes don't seem to
be a part of his old personality, though.
