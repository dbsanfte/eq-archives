I think what was meant that only rangers can crit with bows without CF
AA's, and non-rangers cannot crit with bows unless they start on the
CF line of AA.  Rangers cannot get crits with melee weapons until they
obtain at least CF1.

Having said that, I've never seen a CF'd warrior using a bow, let
alone getting a crit from one :)
