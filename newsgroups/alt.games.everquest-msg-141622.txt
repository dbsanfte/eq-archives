No doubt. As far as gear goes, I consider a monk to be just that, a
monk, and the same goes for any other class. I welcome them to my
groups regardless because all classes bring something to the table.
Nice gear is just a bonus. I don't count on it though. A group leader
requiring it is just not too bright and doesn't show that person to be
anyone I would want to group with anyway.
