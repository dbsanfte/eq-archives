Ya same here, unless theres a Yeli raid me/my group are usually the only
people in the zone..  oh and of course, the 35 bard who shouts for guardian
armour all day long...

Unless you have some really bad luck with FD, dieing here is pretty
unlikely - none of them are casters, and they memblur like a level 20 mob

Everything from those drakes in see invis (in the next 2 rooms about half
see invis)..

When I started pharming and had an uber tash-stick rot, I decided to run my
mage up and camp him in the SS, I wasn't sure if he'd keep 54 (so train and
rez was out the question).. so I had to clear all those rooms - 130 MR and
those green/low blue drakes were nuking for 2-400 each :(

hehe yeah.. over the weekend a few monk friends came and joined me (low
50's) and a guildie 60 mage.. when we were clearing to the big 3 named
cubes, we learnt which would split.. so when the mob runs,  the mage pet
backs off and we let it run a bit.. then when we kill it, fd the adds off
and single pull.    With a group its not too bad of a problem.. our cleric
was on CoV faction though, and having to cast lots of heals is usually a
good way to get a faction hit

Large velium statue I think..  the one that rampages.  Had him range from
lvl52-56.. seems the only time he drops loot though is when hes 55+ (30min
corpse)

I need to learn where the SS bank is though.. and see if I can fd-flop to
there... in a week of killing there, I've had to drop about 2500gp cuz it
totally killed my AC (even with the large coin purse from Yeli)
