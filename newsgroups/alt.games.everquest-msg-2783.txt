the problem is that most all the groups ive seen are oblivious to
everyone else. i cast a firebolt on an orc legionaire to help out a
fighter and all the orcs aggro on me........while all around me other
group members, and other players not in the current group stand around
talking...or sit down to meditate....or go searching for other mobs.
this is why im going to solo from now on.
