Er... Have you noticed that EQ is pretty smooth even with a bad 
connection, and you still can move around and target? Well, *that* is 
what causes two players to move at different speeds: All movement is 
calculated client-side and transmitted to the server: Faster connection = 
more updates. In FPS games, at least in the good ones, movement is all 
server-side to prevent cheats and ensure fairness. The downside is, if 
you drop packets, your movement stalls, because the server can't update 
your position. Unless you are playing on the server itself, your movement 
is lagged.

It's all trade-offs, and EQ got the right balance for the type of game it 
is. The fact that people with faster machines and better connections can 
run a few percentage points faster doesn't make me lose sleep.
