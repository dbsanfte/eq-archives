> Chocolate is only good in very small doses.  And then only sometimes.

   Depends what you call "small", I suppose.  Smaller than
your own head seems to be a reasonable standard to shoot
for, I believe.  I do agree with the "sometimes" part.  It's
no good trying to enjoy chocolate when you're asleep.
   I've never tried wombat urine, so I don't know how
enjoyable it might be.
