Personally, I like the fact there are more possible chances of rezzing for
the pure fact that CR when there is a rezing person near the corpse...  It
saves time than to have to try and find someone to get you back, or fight
or have people pull back for CR retrieval.  It's frustrating and time
consuming.  Heck, having Pallys in their 30s being able to do a 0% rez in a
place like Mistmoore, for instance, for Melee players...  That is
preferable than having the entire group try to get back out, dragging your
corpse so you can loot it.  It would be better if one could get a rez
there, get their gear, and if there was a group evacer there, evac everyone
out without having to fight hard to get out with a low health or low mana
people.
