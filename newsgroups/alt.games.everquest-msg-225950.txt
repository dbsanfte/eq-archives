I've been playing and enjoying my 37 ranger lately, but I have an
aggro-control question.  I'd like some input from the good folks here,
especially those who have played rangers up (as opposed to powerleveling
them).

Situation:
Overthere, Skyfire ramp
Group: Warrior, shaman, druid, rogue, enchanter, ranger (warrior later
changed for paladin)
Levels: 38 +-2; warrior is 38
Equipment:  Warrior is using some sword and a wurmslayer; I'm using a
Defender's Lightblade and a Flamesong that doesn't procc yet, Flamesong
primary.

I ran out, picked a target, plinked to pull.  Run back to group, stand next
to warrior.  Warrior engages mob, I wait until I'm not being hit any more,
engage autoattack and move to back of mob.

After about eight to ten seconds, mob spins and starts whacking me.  I turn
off attack, and back slowly up; mob spins back to warrior after a few
seconds.  I engage autoattack, move forward until I'm not getting 'out of
range' messages, ten seconds later I'm tanking again. I again back off, wait
for mob to spin, re-engage.  Shaman, druid, rogue complain about mob
spinning, healing two people, etc.

After about half an hour of this, warrior gets pissy and leaves.  (For the
record, I don't blame him).  Level 40 paladin joins us.

And the same damn thing happens.  Ten seconds after I engage, the mob is on
me.  The paladin was casting something that looked like a stun, but I
haven't played a paladin enough to know if he was just not stunning often
enough or what.  I am staying at max range for my weapons, I'm not snaring
before the mob is down to 30 percent, I'm not kicking and I'm not taunting.
I tried rooting and backing away, and the rogue just about exploded in
place.  I switched to a 1hb/piercing combo (Bargynn's Torch and Dragoon
Dirk) because my skills in those suck, I got aggro anyway.  Only when I
switched to 2hs (one of those big honking axes from Justice, I forget the
name) did I manage to avoid getting aggro - and I'm convinced it's because
my 2hs skill is at 110, seventy points low.

I'm not trying to start another 'warriors are broken' thread (though I have
a private bet with myself on how many posts it will take for this thread to
turn).  I'm looking for ideas on how I can do significant damage without
pulling aggro off of the MT - at least until I get Jolt!!
