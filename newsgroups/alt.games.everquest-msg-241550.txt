That sucks... I put in 3-5 applications a week for everything i am 
remotely qualified for ranging from data entry to certain types of 
management. I wouldn't mind going back to call center for an insurance 
company because my producer's license is still good, but all the jobs 
are straight sales, most involving cold calling. I would take a job in 
retail sales, but my broken back precludes being on my feet for more 
than 15 minutes or so at a time, or lifting more than 10 lbs. I would 
not quibble at the minimum wage of the position as my husband makes good 
money, though not really enough to do more than keep everything paid up 
right now=\
