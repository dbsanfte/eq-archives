    And war games have victory conditions that aren't related to winning the
war. Many WWII sims, for example, give the Axis powers the victory if they
hold on past a certain turn. The game plans for the sides being unbalanced,
and gives rewards in proportion.

    PvP doesn't do that. If a party of ten guys ganks some poor sod, well,
he loses. He can't win, as he can't defeat his opponents and running away
and losing ground/time aren't recognized by the game as victories. Unless
you think that being a victim is a victory, in which case there's a future
for you in EQ GM event planning.
I don't entirely agree with Dennis's view that all PvP MUST be imbalanced,
but I do agree that a lot of localized ganking that's simply no fun is an
integral part of PvP environments that aren't carefully scripted.

    James
