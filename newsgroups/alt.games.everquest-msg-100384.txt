  I still am trying to figure it out.  Yeah, the Internet isn't as
profitable as it once was, but isn't that chiefly because people have
realized that Internet advertising is basically worthless?  I mean,
Amazon.com has managed to turn a profit, probably because they sell THINGS
for money instead of "selling" little banners and pop-ups that everyone
ignores.  Advertising probably has never been a real source revenue for
Sony/Verant with EQ... if anything, it's likely been an expense.  We know
Verant's revenue stream has remained pretty solid from the numbers we've
been quoted about the number of subscribers EQ enjoys.

  And I don't really buy this notion that their bandwidth costs have gone
through the roof.  I fail to see how the bandwidth of consumption of EQ "per
capita" could have increased by any significant margin... the fact that
bandwidth consumption has increased doesn't mean their profits are any
less... on the contrary, buying bandwidth in greater bulk would likely mean
the amount of money they pay per gigabyte has gone down, which means the
amount of money they have to spend per user has gone down as well, on that
particular expense.

  The main increase in expense that I could understand is the increased load
that the new expansion content has put on their servers.  More zones, more
players and more characters means more storage, memory and processing
horsepower is needed... along with an increase in the effort (manpower) it
takes maintain the infrastructure.  However, the price of the computer
hardware itself also has gone down over the past three years... pretty
dramatically, in fact (something Verant representives/advocates have been
inclined to point out to us in response to complaints over Luclin's rather
demanding system requirements).  Also, I would think labor is cheaper these
days... as all those dot-com's go bust, you'd think that there's been a lot
of technically apt people out there looking for work, and willing to work
for less.  So while the servers are undeniably more powerful and complex
than they were when the game was first released, I would think that the
technology and the economic climate would put a damper on inflating that
particular expense too much.

  Maybe the cost of developing and implementing the expansions has been more
than they've managed to make on retail sales of those expansions.  It's
possible that Verant looks at expansions not as an oppurtunity to make
money, but rather as a way of "keeping up" with the rest of the industry,
retaining customers and bringing in new ones... and actually lose money on
the development of the expansion that retail sales don't make up for.  I
find this a little difficult to believe, considering how well I think these
expansions sell compared to many other retail titles.  Can it really be that
much more resource intensive to create an expansion for an existing game
(albeit a MMORPG which is probably more difficult to code than your average
standalone title with limited multiplayer support)?  It's possible, but I
have my doubts.

  I really am not sure what to believe, not that it really matters.  As long
as EQ is worth the subscription price to me, I'll pay it... and that's only
fair, it's the way capitalism works.  What I don't like is being lied to,
and Verant has been a little less than candid with us in the past at times,
and I suspect that may be the case here.  They're telling us it's
"increasing expenses" that is responsible for the price hike, but I have to
wonder if it's just the result of a business analysis they've run that came
to the conclusion that "we would be making more money if we charged more for
our subscription."  That's capitalism, it may be "greedy", but I see nothing
particularly wrong with greed in the business world, and I'd rather a
corporation be "greedy" than dishonest when I'm their customer.

  Maybe somebody who knows more about the Internet and gaming business (or
business in general) can set me straight?  Confirm my suspicions or debunk
them with hard facts or proven economic ideas?
