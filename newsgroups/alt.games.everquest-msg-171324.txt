I looked around in there, killed a few mobs, but its not really bard heaven.  A)
many of the mobs are light blue, which means very little exp.  The ones that
aren't cyan are clearly not particularly dark either.  While its possible to get
more exp killing tons of low dark blue mobs than a few high dark blues, this
isn't a good plan for a bard, because the mana cost per kill is about the same
regardless of what you are taking out... charm a low blue mob and it does low
blue mob damage to other low blue mobs... you end up with two dead low blues for
about the same mana cost as charming a high blue to kill a high blue, and ending
up with two dead high blue mobs.

The other principle bard killing strategy is to chant kite.  This is slower than
charming, but you get to regen mana while you do it.  Thing is, it requires
being faster than your target mob.  JBoots, Selos, snare on the mob, are the
plans for that.  JBoots last a while indoors, but Selos doesn't really.  And
Snare means taking out about a third of your damage output, in order to keep the
mob walking slow.  Since Echo is indoors... and you have to cross another indoor
zone to get to it, so no jumping over the line to get a quick refresh either...
basically you spend all your time slower than the mobs except for the one you
snared.  And heavens help you if you get an add, cause that means snaring him
too in order to stay out front... this quickly becomes a losing battle.

I ended up doing most of 50 and half of 51 in EW off mobs like these, the
man-o-wars, and some time on the RyGorr fort.  Nice to find I can solo the fort
now... but I got tired of clearing out greens so I could get the good stuff and
then having exp groups pull the elites and so forthe out from under me.  EW
wildlife was pretty good exp at 50, track to a blue, pull it to another blue and
watch them fight, repeat.... worked pretty well, and I did a chant kite in
between each charm kite, seemed to keep mana up decently.  At 51, though, this
started to slow down drastically, fewer blues and I'm guessing the ones that
were blue weren't Very blue.
