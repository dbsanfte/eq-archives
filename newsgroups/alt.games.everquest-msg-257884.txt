'Resist rate'? In GOD the mobs are too high to cast harmony on,
full stop. Anything that cons yellow or above is outright 
immune. As for offtanking, healing, and the other 'utility', that
is equally marginalised by the huge DPS put out by GOD mobs.

Of course, I'm talking KT+, here.

To be entirely honest I'd prefer viable utility than jockying with
the other DPS classes for yet-another-clone-slot, but whatever.

If we could heal, tank and pull well in GOD, but not better than
the real classes, I'd be happy. Say, a 2k mana cost 1.5k base
heal; something we couldnt sustain, but could emergency save with.

Same for nukes. Same for tanking. The ability to perform a 
task for a very brief duration very well reasonably infrequently.

So, your ranger is a mediocre DPS class, but an insurance policy
that can throw out the crackly nukes or super fast heals or
whatever when needed, once an hour.

As it is we're only ever *really* viable one expansion in the past. I
absolutely own in BOT and POE, but I'm using GOD and Time gear.
