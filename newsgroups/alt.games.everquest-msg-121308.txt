i dont think calling cats non-pack animals and dogs pack animals are the
problem.  dogs have more pack tendencies then cats.  its the degree to which
each is a pack animal.  for that matter sharks have been known to exibit
(sp) pack behavior as well as crocs.  just my 2 cents

james

ps personally my opinion from growing up on a farm i think cats are smarter,
but dogs are more useful (unless youre killing mice)
