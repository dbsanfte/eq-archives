granted, you should not put "FBSS" on a single line. However, the
socials are way to short and should allow far longer lines, which is
IMHO the real issue here. I'd love to make auctions into oneliners,
but as a person with handwrist problems, i'm forced to use multilines.
Unless there is some funky way to repeat something nicely in some
other way?
