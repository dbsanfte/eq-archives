My druid has a devil of a time raising skills after each new level...
With 180 wisdom, and a not-too-shabby 97 INT, it takes me a full mana
bar worth of casting level 1 spells to max each skill for each new
level. That's a skill raise every 40-50 casts.

Swimming is worse, it takes me ten or fifteen minutes of solid swimming
(against a wall somewhere, normally Rivervale) to raise one skill point.
Even meditate seems to raise slowly. The only skill that gets maxed
within a few minutes of dinging a new level is Sense Heading.

So, what's the problem? Not enough INT? I seem to remember never having
the same problem with my enchanter, and I always thought that WIS and
INT were pretty much interchangeable when it came to raising skills.

So, should I save a Stein of Moggok for my own use?
