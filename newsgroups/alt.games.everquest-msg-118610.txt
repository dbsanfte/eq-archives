The "Druid" is a beta nuetral NPC that sells Druid Spells at the ring
in Toxx. He cons Indiff to everyone, so all races/classes can buy/sell
with him.

If you are untwinked and looking for some decent cash for your level
(12) then I HIGHLY recommend the Warrens. Even the lowest conning
Kobolds drop Bronze weapons at a decent rate. They also drop
soft-wicker (similar to raw-hide) and dusty burlap armor (similar to
cloth). I can easily net 30-50pp an hour there at level 17-18. It's
not fantastic money, but it is better than any other lowbie dungeon I
have ever hunted in. At level 18 I can still find plenty of dark blue
mobs to fight for exp.
