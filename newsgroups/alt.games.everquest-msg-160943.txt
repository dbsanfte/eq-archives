}I otherwise love the raid window. It would be nice if it had an *optional*

}optional, and then add a health bar to it. I care bigtime about a person's
}level and class when I'm setting up my raid or running my raid group, but
}after the raid setup, I pretty much know who/what my key players are, and

}window space.

That's actually a pretty good idea.  You could create an alternate skin for 
the raid window, and use /loadskin to toggle between the full and modified 
versions.
