I was in NFP last evening buying/selling. Another player wanted to see
the items I had for sale, so I selected the first bag from my
inventory and clicked on the player. I noticed I had to click a few
times to open the trade window, but then the message "I'm busy right
now.." appeared in the chat box several times, so I assumed that was
due to a lag problem. Made me a bit nervous, but I continued. Updon
deciding that he didn't want anything I was offering, the trade window
disappeared and I saw the "The trade has been cancelled." message.

Just a minute later, I went to look at one of my items and noticed
that all 4 bags that I had placed in the trade window were gone. The
wierd part is, I still appeared to be encumbered from carrying them. I
tried zoning, but that didn't help. Please note, that I am a level 18
cleric, twinked only by my own tradeskill efforts and that these bags
contained, among many other items, a Centi Longsword and a Wurmslayer
that I had gotten a good deal on and had been trying to sell for a bit
of a profit. That's pretty big plat for me to have possibly lost.

I petitioned and the guide responed some few minutes later and took
some information. He said he was escalating it to a GM and I would
hear from them shortly. Nearly 2 hours later, I still had yet to hear
from anyone. By then it was like 1:30am. Now I have a job/wife/kids
and cannot stay up all night waiting so I had to log.

What REALLY bothered me, was that all the while I was waiting, I
watched as messages from my guild came across talking about some big
GM event going on in Rathe Mtns. I guess they were too busy goofing
off and having fun to help a customer with a major problem. I was VERY
put off by this.

I sincerely hope that when I am able to log on tonight for what length
of time I have available, a GM will see fit to answer my SECOND
petition and, moreso, be able to help me.

Does anyone know if this is the kind of thing that a GM will be
willing/able to help me with? I lost a skinning knife about a week ago
due to LD while skinning a pelt and they said they could do nothing
about it. That wasn't such a big deal outside of the fact that I had
to travel back to GFay to get the freaking molds necessary to make
another one. Not much out of pocket expense though.

One additional note, I even camped to desktop and restarted EQ to find
the bags still missing and my character still encumbered.
