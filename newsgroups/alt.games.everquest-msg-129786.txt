What's your evidence that all of what the Isaraeli's do is
"collateral damage"? What's your evidence that none of what
the Palestinians do is "collateral damage"?

At best this is circular reasoning.

What's your point? Are you suggesting that the Palestinains should
not use every weapon at their disposal to fight terrorism?

How convinent for Israel. Maybe "fog of war" just as well 
covers some of the dead Israelis...

But maybe that's a bit too even handed for you with your
"Israel has the moral high ground" retoric.

This is a brutal civil war where "tit for tat" has been
going on for so long no one can be sure which is "tit" 
and which is "tat".
