I understood your point precisely, I was just disagreeing that your point
illustrated the possible idiocy of the correlation.  I don't agree that the
intelligence of the programmers/developers is directly related to the length
of time I have been voluntarily playing EQ.  I do believe that there is a
strong likelihood that it does require at least some people of high
creativity to come up with a good workable game such as EQ, that will
capture, and hold the attention of so many people.
