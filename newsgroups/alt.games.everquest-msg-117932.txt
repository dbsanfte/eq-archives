I was just killed in the Qeynos Catacombs, and when I returned to loot
my corpse it wasn't there.  I don't have the precise location as I've
been killed in roughly the same spot several times, but I know where
it should be.  A thorough and methodical search of the area has
yielded nothing.  There are no GMs on line to assist me, which seems
to be the norm on Antonius Bayle.  

Any suggestions?  Am I buggered?  It's only a lvl 12 druid, but I've
spent some time collecting a full set of moss toe armour and weapon
etc and I'd rather not go through all that again.
