Firstly... you are using 2 fletches and no shaft... Ceramic Vane is a Fletch
:o)

Second... if you're just combining for skill-up purposes, only use the
SINGLE component that trivials next...

... in this case, you want to use a wood point, wood shaft, large nock and
ceramic vane... this will get you to skill 202, after which you either have
to farm stuff and learn some basic smithing to make Acrylia based arrows, or
stick to store bought stuff and waste mucho-plat failing to make Bows (Rough
Darkwood trivials at 215, costs over 220plat per attempt)
