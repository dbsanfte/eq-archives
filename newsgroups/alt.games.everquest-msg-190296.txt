Being new to EQ I don;t really have much of a say. Haven't paid enough
dues yet..... but for what it's worth I look at names like that, in
any game, as a signal of the player's attitude. More importantly I
look at names like that as a great indicator of an individual I want
to nothing to do with. I kinda wished we had that in real life. Of
course the younger set already have their signs.... Baggy pants
hanging half off their butts, hat on backwards and multiple piercings.
I won't even give them the time of day in my store.... I find if I
ignore them long enough they will leave. Maybe if more did that they
might get the message.

Now if we had some sort of sign for the older jerks.... :)

Problem in this country is we give too much publicity to crackpots!
