hmmm   wife's machine has the same chipsets.  Epox MB.  AMD north & Via
south.  I stumped on this one.   Did you reapply DX & then install the video
& sound in that order?  That is what finally stopped her from crashing with
the SoL expansion.

WAIT

Did you try changing from AGP X4 to X2?   I know I had to do that pre-SoL on
wife's.   Still have the fast-writes inabled.  I am sure her's is still X2
AGP.    I benchmarked it after changing it & it didn't seem to hurt the
perfomance much.    A few frames a sec lost is all.
