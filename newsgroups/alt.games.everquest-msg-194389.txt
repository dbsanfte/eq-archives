Whether there has been any litigation against someone for using a firewall
is hard to say 100% either way, but we can assume to some degree that if
it _had_ happened, someone would probably be making references to it in
order to prove just how horrible the S-DMCA is.  Since they haven't...we
can probably conclude that no one has been paddled, stoned, sued,
institutionalized, or been made to dance the hokey-pokey for having a
firewall. :/

Does that mean it's still OK to have a law that can allow folks to
prosecute you for any number of faultless reasons (using VPN to work from
home, having fun sharing code an online crypto community, using a TIVO,
and yes, using a firewall :b)?

Saying that something wouldn't happen because it hasn't happened yet isn't
enough of an argument for not being concerned.  Not to get all patriotic
on folks, but it's our "duty" as members of a supposed democracy to keep a
critical eye on legislation.  Doesn't mean we have to believe in
conspiracy theories and rant against Big Brother (though I've nothing
against it if you want to), just means we need to be willing to say "hold
on a minute...what does that mean again?".

Now watch what you say
Or they'll be calling you a radical
A liberal, oh fanatical, criminal
Oh won't you sign up your name
We'd like to feel you're
Acceptable, respectable, oh presentable, a vegetable!
