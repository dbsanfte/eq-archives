So in other words, you don't like it when people bitch about what other
people post, so you feel compelled to bitch about what other people are
posting?

If you don't like what people are saying, then take your own advice.

Oh kettle, thou art black!

Let's see.  From what I read, nobody is allowed to bitch about what other
people post.  Except you.

And if someone sees something they don't want to read, don't read it. 
Except you, who is forced to read it at gunpoint, and then forced to bitch
about it.

<sniff sniff>  Mmmm, I love the smell of hypocrisy in the morning.
