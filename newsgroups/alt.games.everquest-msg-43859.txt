I did the exact same thing with my warrior friend, him at 16 me at 14 as a
druid, we killed the smithy and foodmaster a lot, if your druid is  a wood
elf or halfling, use racial hide to med safely, target a kobold, hide, con,
if indifferent, med, if scowling, hide off and wait to re hide, then repeat.

made 17 in warrens, then 19 in SB, then ran off to hunt elsewhere with my
kickass port spells =)

Got the filth covered boots off the packmaster on my last day in the
Warrens, that was awesome.  Also carrying around a ball peen hammer in range
slot til I get something better.

We tried to take the muglwump with me a 19 druid, a 24 (soon to become 23)
bard, 19 warrior and 31 enchanter.   All of us died except the enchanter,
who also made the kill trivial =/  (stupid kobold swarm).

As a druid at 14, you could solo the summoned stuff in Lavastorm, the
summoned DDs are AWESOME for that, but your melee friend is SOL on that one,
so you might try highpass orcs or gnolls.
