Upon further reading the tird para says,
"In the first edition of Dungeons & Dragons, there was a race of demi-humans
known as hobbits that were very much like those found in The Hobbit and The
Lord of the Rings. The Tolkien estate did not appreciate the resemblance and
threatened legal action against TSR, the makers of Dungeons & Dragons. TSR
renamed the folk halflings, another word coined by Tolkien for the race, but
not as commonly used in the books."

So it did appear in the books.
