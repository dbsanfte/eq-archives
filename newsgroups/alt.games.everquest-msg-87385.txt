I was with some friends in a dungeon not too long ago and they asked me 
where my pet was.  I told them I really preferred not to have my Chanter 
pet up in a dungeon, the small benefits don't match up with the possible 
horrible endings.  They didn't believe it, so I called Jobober up to the 
plate to show them the error of their ways, knowing we had 2 evacers in 
the group.  It was ok for a while, but after about 45 minutes, it finally 
happened.

Me:  "Guys, it's time to go NOW, my pet's lost and fighting."
Bud: "It shouldn't be a big train, right?"
Me:  "Well, it ain't going to be HO scale, I can guarantee you that."
