I would have to say that I just love the Warrior / Cleric / Rogue
combination and the past 10 levels have seemed to fly by.   We have at times
added others to our little triad, (wizards, shaman, druids, rangers...)  but
for a solid core, the 3 of us make a nice team.  Hunting some relativly safe
and good exp zones and spots have also helped by not getting the dreaded
negative exp gain, (Deaths). I seem to recall only dying twice since level
40 but there may be another death in there that I am forgetting.

CoM from 44-46 and EJ from 47-50 were just perfect for us.  SPOILER - the
Emerald Jungle / Trak zone line is a perfect little hunting spot. Never a
crowd and huntable from the middle forties to over 50. Just pull to the zone
line.  We managed almost steady pulling of blues and never had a problem.
At most times, we were the only souls there and found it to be relaxing.  I
see it as the same as Dreadlands but without the crowd.  This means its a
"bring your own group" so do your planing.  It also helps to have some druid
friends to evac you in but I will have to admit, the run from FV is NOT that
bad.  I can do it in about 10-13 minutes with a sow. Up FV to Swamp, Up
swamp to FoB and over to EJ.  At post 40, this run is mostly safe.  The only
downside to EJ is that when you are done, you will have to get someone to
show you what loot is as you would have forgotten all about that stuff.

After hearing how tuff 45 would be, I was pleased to do it all over one 3
day weekend at CoM. (A real butt-numb-athon, I'll admit) but it is possible.
Level 40 was my longest lasting Hell level so far, seemed to take 2-3 weeks
but I admit, I was running around a good portion of the time doing guild
favors. Also, I was in Rathe quite a bit in level 40, (good plat - SLOW
exp.)

I will have to get together with Jakugg and Tiru and go over all the good
places we have hunted in the past few months to post on my guilds website.
It would make a good leveling lesson for the others.  Also, It should be
noted that our triad usually only plays together for a few hours a night
with some longer weekend sessions thrown in.

So to sum it all up...  Work on getting good steady partners who play when
you do.  You will advance sooooo much faster than when you are LFG in the
common "pick-up" group zone.  It's alot safer too.

Oh well, enough self harping.

Orlun, level 50 newbie rogue, xev
