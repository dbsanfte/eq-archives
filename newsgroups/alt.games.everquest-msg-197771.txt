You need to not look at the single number - mana efficiency>all
for sustained dps - it's the reason I don't used Firebolt of
Tallon - my specialization and lack to the 61 damage focus makes
it less efficient than SoFB.  I don't need to see the big 1900
damage message and know I spent way more mana than  I did on the
1200 damage spell.  Bl's can chain their 3 nukes for 900dam/300mana
every 30 seconds - a barely sustainable rate for a fighting BL
with VOQ+PoT9+SD+FT13 - obviously not trivial mana regen.
