Remember, getting to that point is only a VERY Uber wizard.. maybe 5 percent
of the wizard population on any given total.

Also don't forget that for the majority of a Wizard's Career, a Mage can
nuke better. At level 34 a Mage's nuke outdamages that of a Wizard, AND they
get a pet.

Wizards dont need to be nerfed. They just recieved that boost they need.
