Balticon has one day memberships which are less and can be converted
to full membership by paying the difference to the full weekend if you
decide to return for more than the one day. You could try one day and
see if you like it. (Which is the reason we have one days at all) The
one day rates are only available at the door so you can not
pre-register in advance and will not be announced till the end of
April on the web page so check the web site www.balticon.org then. One
days are proportional to the amount of program that day, but are a lot
less than the full weekend if you are showing up for only one day and
or want to sample the event.
