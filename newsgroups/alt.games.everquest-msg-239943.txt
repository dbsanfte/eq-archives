Fine. Die a big tough guy. Seems to defeat the purpose if you ask me, but 
I'm not gonna further debate a figure of speech.

Honestly, you guys really aren't representing your originating forum very 
well here. Was it your intent to set up access to a.g.e. so you could 
jump at any opportunity to fight that came along? Were you not getting 
enough of that at home?

I'll be completely honest. EMarr may have a lot of great people for all I 
know. However, I've seen my share of web forums, and sadly the majority 
were comprised primarily of children hiding behind their anonymity with 
big ol' chips on their shoulders. You're only task here to be accepted is 
prove that you're not that kind of group. If you have not interest in 
acceptance, then why the hell are you here to begin with?

Above all, don't dump shit in someone else's yard.
