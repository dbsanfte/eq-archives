I had a problem like that last night (pre-patch).  I logged in a few times
and it took quite some time from the char selection screen to ingame screen,
then booted me to the desktop without errors.  After the third attempt, I
figured maybe it was skins so I did a "/loadskin default 1" and waited a few
mins and....Desktop. So, I rebooted the computer and logged in and it worked
fine from then on.  Not sure what the problem was but it's working now.
