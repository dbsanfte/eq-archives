I'm not, but I think I worked it out. I was trying "/pet guard here"
well away from the fight to get my pet to stay out of the freaking way
until I was ready for it. Then when things looked ok I'd run back in its
command range and say "/pet kill x", which he would dutifully attack.

Then I'd fear x, and he'd turn on y and break mez.

I am thinking he was still in "guard here" mode despite the kill
command and rabidly trying to get everytthing to go away.

I'm the only healer and bandaids dont work from horseback ;) I'm not
gonna let pat die, would rather bite it myself.


*struts about feeling brave*

*respawns at bind point*

*feels stupid and blames pet*

I think I still have a deeply ingrained "save the caster!" mentality from
being a ranger ;) I must try to remember I *am* the caster now ;)

>Keep with it!  Necros are cool!

I love everything, except the feeling I'm getting myself killed
needlessly. Honestly, I am seriously considering /pet get lost and
just summoning a new one in future.
