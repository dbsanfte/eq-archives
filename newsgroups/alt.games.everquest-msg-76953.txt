Actually, the price ranges up to over 100pp.  The really nice thing about
the Coldain Velium weapons compared to the Velium weapons is that the
Coldain ones proc at level 1.  I have personally verified this.  It's only a
12pt dd, but getting that to proc a couple times or so during a battle makes
a big difference at low levels.
