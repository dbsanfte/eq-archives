What you are really describing is the problem with a

desireable magnet spawns in places like karnors while
other places are often empty in the world. I think whatever
you do in response to such backwards ass game design
is really the right thing to do and fully support it. I am just
really surprised that players respect camps as much as they do.

Yep, as I said below this is just bad design. What a game really needs
is for there to be no more reason to kill things in karnors than to
kill similar level mobs anywhere else in the 3 eq continents. It all
goes back to why is the FBSS only on some frog in lower guk while
a hill giant (who should seem to be pretty successful) only drops like
66 plat and an FS sometimes? Whatever mobs of a level througout
all the world should have an equal very low chance to drop such very
rare loots. That would mean redesigning the entire game though
so it won't happen.

There should never be any "desireable spots."

Yep, it kinda comes down to a "do unto others as you' d have them..
etc" rule.

Frankly I'd just go somewhere besides Seb. There are some
magnet areas that are very popular but my 54 druid has never even
really grouped in seb, I refuse to wait. I've never even waited 10 
minutes for a group, let alone hours. I find its best to be in a guild
and get a few people to do an area no one else is doing like parts
 of kael or something.

In the end you'd regret it, because people would go out of their way
to jump camps of yours. Some time you are going to be trying to 
camp an epic thing or something and no one is then going to respect
your camp just because you say "OH BUT WE RESPECT EPIC 
CAMPS SO STOP, OKAY????!! PLZ????" Its not going to make a difference
to them when you behaved like A-holes at so many other locations.

A fundamental game design problem which won't ever be fixed is causing
everything you are talking about: 

Staticness.

The irony is that with Star Wars Online verant seems to be making the
Anti Everquest more than Funcom's AO even. In fact I might actually 
buy it even though EQ made me view verant as ignorant heavy handed
morons. In SWO they talk of things such as when you kill all of X mob
in an area they are gone.. you killed them all. Later another type may
take that area, it even has insurance saving like AO ... crazy.. and
seems to put down everquest almost by saying something that no it
won't have camping much since they don't see that as being fun. Odd
but I seem to remember Abashi just not that long ago arguing with a
post of mine about the lack of fun due to downtime and camping in 
EQ... weird that Verant changed their mind so fast. 

After trying AO and some other stuff and seeing that in the long run
nothing really STILL compares to EQ in spite of all its flaws, I think
that ironically enough Verant will be the one to best its OWN game
and fianlly cause the mass exodus via SWO. Of course even they 
probably figure that is far enough off that they will have made more
of a success of EQ than any other mmorpg probably (except maybe
that lineage bloodpledge thing koreans are nuts for)
