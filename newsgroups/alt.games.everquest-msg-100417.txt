Ben Sisson, the archetypical asshole Dr00D. Congrats on lowering
further the expectations the EQ community has for players of that
class.

Am I the only person that notices that EQ seem to attract a high
proportion of socially maladjusted twerps? Or maybe it's just that
these types stay with EQ longer because it helps feed their pitiful
ego? Not to say there aren't good folks playing the game, but we've
all met the griefers and generally pompous rude assholes like Mr.
Sisson here. I wonder why these people enjoy being such shmucks.
