I had an interesting experience the other day when I dropped out of game and
into chat to find out where the "Legendary" GM service had gone too...

Me: "Damn - got snowed under a mob pile in Dalnir after gate refused to
work: zone down error msg. Anyone know what happened to our GM's on
Legends?* It's been over 2 hours"

Night-GM: "Language - no profanity xxxx (me)"

*I pause to re-read very carefully what I had written, obviously confused*

Me: "Err - is "Le*ends" now a swear word around here or are you referring to
"Da*n"?"

Night-GM: "The second one - and even writing it like that, I won't warn you
again."

Me: "Umm - which dictionary exactly do you guys use there?"

Night GM: "One written by an old blind nun".

*this confused me greatly as it just made no sense and wasn't witty either*

<<fast forward 5 minutes>>

gmgroupie08: "I like listening to <insert some band> here whilst playing
EQ."

Night-GM: "I like Enigma. It's great for EQ"

Me:    "Language Night-GM. I am a devout catholic and find that reference
offensive."

*a long silence ensues*
