Why 24-36 hours?  If it is because you have limited resources, I'm about 99.993
GB/month under my bandwidth allowance where I have my domain hosted, and 9.8 GB
under my disk usage allowance.  If you'd like, I think I can spare the 134k disk
space and whatever bandwidth it would use to stick a copy of it on my site. :-)

The downside would be that I would probably forget about it, so that version
might stay there a long time.

Actually, I have a reseller account, and the numbers I gave above are for my personal
site.  I've also got a 10 GB pool of disk space and 100 GB/month pool of bandwidth that
I can allocate to other domains or to subdomains.  I don't actually resell--I just have
a reseller account because it gives more control over my domain.
