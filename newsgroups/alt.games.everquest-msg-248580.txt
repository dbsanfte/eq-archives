Since people have answered the rest, I'll throw in my two coppers on
this one. Instead of going for flowing thought items first, invest the
money in an ornate leather boot mold first of all. At least on
Bristlebane, it's a relatively cheap piece of ornate (around 30k) and
the MP4  on it will do more for your mana regen/usage than any flowing
thought item you could get for that kind of cash. 

Rgds, Frank
