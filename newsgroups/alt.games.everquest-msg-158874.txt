As others have stated, as a general rule of thumb, tradeskills are
going to be a time/plat sink for you until you get your skill into the
200's range.

However, I have found that if you are starting a new character that
will be completely untwinked (like I tend to do every other day) there
are a few really good tradeskills you can practice that will not cost
you very much money, because the components you will need are being
dropped from the creatures you're hunting.

My newbie DE rogue started out tailoring bandages and patchwork armor
from the spiderling silks and ruined wolf pelts that drop regularly in
Nektulos, without spending any practice points in the guild hall. Now
at level 6, he is decked out in full patchwork and multiple stacks of
bandages, and has about a 20 skill in tailoring, while only spending
around a plat or two for patterns. I was even making extras and
passing random pieces out to anyone who could use it.

Baking was also do-able without first putting in any practice points.
Spider legs and wolf meat drop regularly enough that I end up with a
few stacks of Spider leg crunchies and wolf steaks.

With my now level 20 ranger, I had him start out on fletching, and
soon he was making long range pulling arrows and 2-3 damage arrows for
far less money than the store bought arrows per stack.
