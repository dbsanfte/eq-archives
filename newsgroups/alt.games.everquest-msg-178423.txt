Not just raids though.  If you fall asleep in *any* group, or go AFK
indefinitely, you are being a leech.  Period.  No Group Member is better than a
Bad Group Member.  If my Mom shows up at the door I let her in, give a hasty
apology to my group and LOG OFF.   Mooching experience off your group says
something about the character of the player, IMO.
