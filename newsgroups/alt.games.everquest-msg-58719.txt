Thanks , I had considered this.  My question was prompted by someone suggesting
Pallys and SK might have a higher defensive class somehow , I dont really
understand that that well , but imagined, if for example, the CAP was higher or
different, it would only be noticeably so during the higher levels.

I take it then , that all things being 'equal' , warriors should _take_ hits as
well as dish out damage , even if there is an SK or Pally available?

TIA
