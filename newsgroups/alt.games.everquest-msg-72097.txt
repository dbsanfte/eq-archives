My Druid has dinged lvl 50 more times than I care to count.......

14-18 are some of the worst levels for a Druid. Your DD spell is weak
(level 9 ignite if I remember correctly), and your heal is inadaquate.
Once you hit 19 you will begin to feel the true power of the class,
and at 24 you will be a happy puppy. Hang in there. I passed those
levels in groups. It is more fun to fight and sometimes die with other
people. 

Don't sweat it. There is no prize for hitting level 60. It's the
friends and adventures you have along the way, that makes the game
fun.
