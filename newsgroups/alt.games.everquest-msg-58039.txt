What the hell is that ogre wearing to get over 100 INT? Admittedly I've
never even tried to raise it on my Troll, but I don't think my INT's
even come close to 70. Hence the complete lack of *any* trade skills
except a tailoring skill of about six from when I was making silk
swatches while gathering materials for Tiru back when silks didn't
stack.
