Yeah, I was in OT at the time, saw the messages.  The winged thing headed
into Skyfire, that was the last I knew about it.  Also was told that there
was another GM event last night (Wednesday) in OT, don't know any details, I
was busy dying in Dreadlands.

On a side note, do you have any idea how long a level 35 unbuffed shaman can
stand up to 3 Drolvarg Ragers?  I do, twice.  I did get my level 36 back
though.  I was wasting time yesterday afternoon, wandering back from Halas
to Kunark, stopped in Highpass to wait until daybreak. Went into the keep,
down to take a look at the goblins, found that some are still blue to me,
ran, found a train at the narrow stairs out, no way around them, no way out,
gate not memorized.  Lost a full yellow.  I was just barely into level 36.
Got a rez from a guildmate, gave me back most of the xp, still not quite 36.
Went to Dreadlands to play with some friends in the evening, and that's how
I found out about the Drolvargs, good thing I was still 35, only lost a bit
over one blue to each of those deaths.  Got it all back and then some during
the next 3 hours in DL.  Overall, the zone seems to be alot of fun.
