Agreed on the leather, no more patchwork, just upgraded to studded leather
at lvl 11.  Certainly would not be devastating to lose my corpse, just
annoying, money is trivial to come by at that level.  CB belts, or DF belts.

Took me one day to earn enough money from CB belts to purchase a combine
Scimitar so I could kill wisps.  I was lvl 11 at the time.  Found out later
on that I could probably have gotten a Velium (sp?) weapon cheaper, would
have taken me an hour or so to raise that cash.  Again, not that much lost
time.

I would go ahead an keep trying, but in the meantime, you should be able to
replace most of the equipment, unless you were twinked, fairly rapidly.  You
don't have to buy your spells again after all.
