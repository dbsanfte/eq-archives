Sure they may twink them up and level them to 20 or 30.  But let them
try to level to 59-65 (through some of the most boring,
hard-to-get-a-group levels where Rangers just aren't wanted) and get
30 or 40 AA's as an "alt".  I know that I spent loooong boring hours
LFG and soloing in Eastern Wastes, Tenebrous, Jagged Pines, Velks,
wherever.

I'm not too worried about those morons making it to Hunter status. 
There may be a lot of mee-too's running around but I doubt most of
them have the time or dedication.

Offtanking will not increase DPS unless you are a DOT-heavy class. 
Even this is questionable though.  What unnecessary offtanking will do
is nearly double the mana drain on healers and debuffers.
