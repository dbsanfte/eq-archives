True, but the option is there for those who don't have time to group.

And, when you can only play for an hour at a time, it's a big boon.

Celaeno does things with her druid that are outside the norm, just like I
tend to solo my paladin.  The thing is, neither of us are asking for drastic
changes in the class, just to fit our playing styles.  hughes, OTOH, wants
the druid class to be redefined to fit what he wants to do with them.  This
would severely imbalance the druids, and almost make them as powerful as
Bards.

Now, that sucks.  It's not as if the GMs get off their duffs and do events
very often, and when they do, you're excluded.  Bah!

Especially for those of us who don't have the option to bind close by.
