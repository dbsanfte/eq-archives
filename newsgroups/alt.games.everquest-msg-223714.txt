> Why do I have a bad feeling about this!

I am not sure since it was possible in a work around fashion anyway (ie,
through Stormahmmer), except for no drop items. They are just legitimising
an existing "grey market" and making an extra buck out of it. The more
lucrative SoE are the more incentive for them and others to keep producing
MMORPG worlds.

Any balance issues created kinda fade into insignificance when you compare
it with what has happened recently from exploits, ie cheese vendors and
shark money.
