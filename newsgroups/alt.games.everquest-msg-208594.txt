Bronze, this dropped with abandon too off the kobolds, thing is it doesn't
stack and is fairly heavy, and vendors pay very little for it, so soon I was
letting it rot or destroying it.  Very plentiful.

Full size Coyotes perhaps?  The Small ones over near the kobolds weren't
this generous thats for sure.

I didn't see any plague rats, someone told me they were very hard to kill at
my level, and given that the price on the tails off a vendor was 10 times
that of any other item, I believed them.  Guess I look silly now.

I've wandered around in AkAnon before in a previous life.  Anything I can
accomplish in another zone, I will, AkAnon is a series of long unneccessary
walks mixed with equal parts maze, subway tunnel, and water park.

There are Tons of plate looking drops off them, but since I have a cloth
wearer, and my friend is a chain wearer vah shir, it didn't seem like
something to pursue

Trivial Loot Code, a monstrosity that was introduced with the release of the
warrens and slated to go in full tilt when Luclin came out.  What it does,
more or less, is make it so if you kill a green mob it won't drop any magic
items it might have had on it.  There's more to it than that, but I'm not
sure I understand the finer points.  At any rate, it was so poorly recieved
that they eventually removed it from the warrens and never implemented it on
Luclin after all... except for one server, Firiona Vie, where it is in place
in Every zone (not just Warrens and Luclin, which were presumably designed
around it) but in all the old world and new world zones as well... and at
the same time there are almost no items at all coded No Drop

Low level pets that will wield a weapon do up to either their native damage
or twice the damage rating of the weapon, and retain their 30 delay
regardless of the delay of the weapon.  Therefore, equipping a level 4 mage
pet with a rusty two handed sword will give it a max damage of 18 instead of
8... and a rusty halberd, a max damage of 20!  I've always made a habit of
saving these two weapons and handing them to group mates with pets or even
just strangers fighting near me at very low levels; now I can make use of
them myself.

As an aside, Crude Bone Halberds drop fairly frequently in Shadeweaver, no
drop on most servers but nice pet weapons on FV.

Ack, I said Morel Thule cause thats where my previous 6 characters have
been... but this is Firiona Vie, which makes quite a difference

Splendid, 10 gnome mage, Firiona Vie
