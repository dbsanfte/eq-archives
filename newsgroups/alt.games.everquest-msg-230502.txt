Being a Troll is a problem.  Also level 5 is too low to hunt there alone.
The Muddites are levels 10-16 but drop all the ore you would ever need to
start Blacksmithing.  The official name of this zone is Gorge of King Xorbb.
The more common name is The Beholder's Maze because of the Evil Eyes that
wander the zone and the named Evil Eyes in the center of the zone.  There
are also Minotaurs that roam the zone.  Getting to this zone will be tough
as a troll since you have to travel either from the Eastern Planes of the
Karanas or from Misty Thicket (inhabited by Halflings that do not like
Trolls but you can usually avoid them) and then a short trip through the
upper level of Runnyeye Citadel.  Do not try and use the POP book in Misty
Thicket unless you have a way of getting past the Halfling guards.  Misty
Thicket is a forest zone that is basically divided in half, with a wall
going through the center of it.  There is only one gate in the wall and two
Halfling guards hang out there.  Once through this gate the monsters (mainly
animals) are tougher than the ones on the inside of the wall.  Here is a
link to more info about this zone:  http://www.eqatlas.com/gxorbb.html
So it probably would be wise to wait until your early teens to try and make
a trip to Gorge of King Xorbb.
