Nope.  Totally not there.  Everything on, everything maxed, the appropriate
stuff in my eqclient.ini, using the default skin (and the appropriate files
copied into custom directories to be safe), DirectX 9, textures on and on

chest armor issues for ages and ages and ages now, that won't go away
regardless of the fixes I use.
