Problem with this analogy...  Is the fact that while it is a minor
inconvience to go from BB Rings to Gfay, to port to Tox Spires, tell him to
use the Scion (And this assumes a big lot that the player has Luclin) to
get to Gfay is still incorrect.

Why?  First off, BB Rings is one zone away from Gfay.  A fair number of
people are willing to take the BB port to get to Gfay if there is no wizard
available to port.  While the original poster also stated he had no clue
how to get from BB to Gfay, your analogy is not on the same level as the
issue at hand, because people in BB can, and often times do help people get
to Gfay from the rings, versus people in Tox without Luclin.  Your analogy
is further flawed by presuming a Wizard would port a person to Tox and
telling them to go through Luclin to get to gfay, given the fact that the
Wizard would have Fay Portal at the same time as Tox Portal.  Druids do not
have the ability to get to Gfay directly, and BB is the closest, safest
means to get to Gfay and does not require a portal in question.

Another thing you seem to have missed (And this is not to support Ben, but
to point out a flaw in the analogy), is that the person who originally
posted also made the mistake of not verifying who the porter was.  You
assume also, that the druid in question purposely mislead the person.  This
may or may not be true.  The Druid probably did what you are doing now...
Assumed the person knew that BB would be closest way to get to Gfay, and
delivered the person to a reasonable drop off spot he was able to do.

Being a druid player myself, I do inform people the closest I would be able
to do, and in some ports, I would do a 'hot port' which would be, I fulfill
my port, then jump the hell out, leaving them to their own.  The druid
failed in a courtesy of informing his ride what he would do, and I fault
the druid on that, but as for intentions, we will never be sure if it was
just pure money grubbing, or a bad assumption on his part.

Either way, both sides made mistakes.  The original poster for not checking
who the porter class was, (Also some slight judgement impairment on posting
this rant...) and the Porter for not informing his ride where they were
going.

If you look at your analogy above...  It would be the issue.  Porting to BB
has been considered a fairly reasonable alternative, and in some cases, had
the original poster asked how to get from the BB rings to Gfay, some
porters will help guide a person there or passerbys who get ported to BB
would guide said person along.  Most port riders who can't get the convient
Wizard port accept Druid ports, when effort is made to assist them, such as
Dark Races who hunt treants, they ask for a Camo so they don't get bitch
slapped by the Common's Druids or the North Karana Druids when they need a
ride to those places.

The Druid ported him from LoIO to Fawdyer.  Let's see...  For a Druid to
get said person to Gfay other than BB or Steamfont, would require Going to
Tox or North Karana to get to the spires, assuming said person had Luclin,
Down to 'Tox' due the fact that North Karana has druids that hate dark
races.  Again, this is using your flawed analogy up above.  Your current
analogy is even worse, because now, you fail to see the difference between
good enough versus 'whim'.  Rezzes has always had 'do you accept this res'
prior to the percent xp thing.  The player has the option to deny the
request, but money has changed hands and the player doesn't have the option
of getting the money back at all or get further assistance based on the
player at hand.  The druid in question has given the service he could
offer, just as you could only offer a 90% rez, it wasn't a whim, it was
trying to provide the best service you could.  When you use analogies, try
using the one that best FITS the situation, not one that will fit your
idealism.

Actually, there is a way to get to Gfay in butcher with low visibility and
with nary a problem, even for a dark race.  It requires only to have good
sense of direction and following the wall.  The wall along the south and
east of Butcherblock from Rings to Gfay entrance only has indifferent mobs,
if anything, goblins in the light blue to possibly blue for a Level 16
Troll, and this also assumes the troll has been doing some Runnyeye or BB
goblin bashing of recent to get less than apprenhensive con.  It would
avoid the guards, since Dorf Guards don't patrol unlike dragoons of
Nektulos, nor do they get kited out of position to those areas to make the
troll into mincemeat travelling this path.

Just so you know...  Druids offer to port to zones closer.  And here is
another thing.  Some people actually *gasp* ask for ports of somewhere
close if no one can port to said location.  So are you saying that the
person asking the port should expect no one to answer if someone can port
close to the zone in question?  Again, as a Druid, I do fault the other
druid for not informing the portee what they would do...  But I find the
post somewhat his fault for not checking and they bitching about the fact a
Druid ported him to BB when he, himself did not make a conscious effort to
look or confirm who the porter was.  Color me paranoid...  I don't make
blind trades with players, I make sure before I click on 'trade' that I get
what I ask for or know what I am getting into.  Should the original poster
have done so?  Yes.  There are jackasses who would have just ported away
and laughed at you for falling for the scheme because you didn't take the
effort to check.  This player would sound like a prime candidate for 'Let
me pay you with my high level alt for this...' scam.
