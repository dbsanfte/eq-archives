And you're not going to notice ANY difference between a 1.7 and a 2.0GHz.
WHAM, there ya save $222!  And quite honestly the chances of you noticing
any difference between a 1.5 and 2.0 are pretty slim...especially when EQ
seems to care more about the amount of RAM you have (greater than 512 is
best, from what I'm hearing from different sources) and the type of video
card you have (Geforce3, any model, I believe)
