Since your FV questions were answered, I will address some of the
husband/wife issues:

My wife and I play, normally just the two of us and have learned a great
deal.  Our original combination was me as a druid, her as a warrior.  It
worked out great.  But it got boring.  Almost accidentally, our second round
of characters became our mains and so I shall give some examples of what we
faced and so on.

First Combo - HLF DRUID, ELF WARRIORESS

Very little downtime levels 1-20.  I kept us healed, buffed, and sowed, she
did what warriors do.  We were picky abt our hunting zones to make sure she
was never bound more than a couple of zones away.

Lvl 20-25, did the LOIO thing, and downtime picked up as we discovered that
my heals were sorely lacking in terms of her hitpoints.  Still, exp was
steady, and we rarely grouped with anyone.

Lvl 25-30 Group-O-Rama.  We hit the Sarnak fort and alternated with the
Giant Fort in FM, mainly inviting others of ANY class to join us.  These
levels flew by.  Once I got my ports, we began dungeon touring places like
Splitpaw, Unrest, Guk, etc.  Died a bunch, but as my spells grew in power,
we discovered what most everyone already knew, a druid/warrior combo is
fearsome, especially out doors.

30-35 Beleive it or not, we started getting bored with this combo around lvl
34, after questing a bit then revisiting many of the zones we had had
problems in as younger characters, we decided to try something different.

Now she had made a ranger that she played and had it to about lvl 14 or so,
and I had a human monk I was partial too (because I was determined to keep
him naked and just run around punching things) and had lvl'd the munkee to
about 11 or so.

WE drug those two out, and the rest became history.  Our unlikely duo had
crawled almost every 45 and under level dungeon in the game (racking up
deaths by the hundred score) and are now a most unlikely lvl 47 munkee and
45 rangeress.

The point is -- any combo will work... HAVE FUN :)

(Btw - we are thinking abt a necro/sk duo for our next run)

Wolvescall - 35 -Druid
Aliexandra - 35 - Warrior

Cason - 47 - Monk
Kealailye - 45 - Ranger
