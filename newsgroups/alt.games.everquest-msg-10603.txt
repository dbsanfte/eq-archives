IIRC this problem didn't exist in AC, so Abashis answer is suspect.

Creatures in AC didn't get inside each other (thus you could make a stand in a
narrow hallway and fight them one at a time).

I never had any significant lag in AC (unlike EQ).  Can anyone who is more
knowledgable in these things offer an opinion on why AC seems to manage it but
it would cause massive lag on EQ to do it>
