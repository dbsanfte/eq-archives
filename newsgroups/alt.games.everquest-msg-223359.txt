Nah, it wil take cosiderably longer, although it would be possible. I was
aiming for 38 this weekend AoE kiting at Iceclad but that passed with some
time to spare. I stayed there for 39 as well since most of the cougars were
dark blue with only a quarter light blue. AoE kiting is extremely effective
leveling-wise as I was frequently AoE'ing every single cougar from both
islands, but it takes 100% concentration and mistakes can and do happen due
to it's limited range hence how tight the circles are you have to run in and
the fact that due to them following you anytime they do nip you it is more
prone to stun you than not.. I got killed twice, only once due to the
cougars and another time I tried seeing if the dire wolfs were doable as
well (not recommended - they are too fast).

BTW - there is a named snowcougar called midnight (it's black) that spawns
rarely there, avoid it like the plague if AoE'ing as it runs much quicker
than all the other cougars so you have to kite it down first before even
starting on the others - makes for a dang long kite.

After 39 I bound in EC tunnel and headed for Timorous Deep: spirocs. They
are actually easier in one way - they run slower so are more forgiving on
the circling but have much more HP so the length of the kite means you lose
concentration easily and bam - they get you. I was distracted momentarily
and accidently turned too sharply and ran back through my pack of about a
dozen spirocs. Somehow I just survived... I still don't know how.

The biggest problem is the XP is coming in too quickly with this method- my
skills are falling behind. Some off hours instrument playing in EC tunnel
helps those catch up but mellee skills are another matter. I think I will
grab 2 at a time, charm one, chant it down aftewr charm breaks and mellee
the remaining halfbeat up mob just so my mellee skills keep up. Either that
or invest a good part of my 60 saved skill points in Defence which is the
most important and difficult to raise. Anyway - I just hit 40, the spirocs
are good to 52, 54 if I don't mind the light blue. Plenty of time to catch
up if I don't get addicted to the easy XP of AoE'ing.

It was definately the Jboots which made AoE kiting possible for me, selos
would make me run too quick and make the circling impossible to maintain,
let alone that the circling requires every bit of concentration I have so
twisting would have been out of the question. It's hard to imagine if you
haven't done it - the radius of the AoE is small so they are either only a
whisker off chewing your butt or out of range altogether. Accidently make
too sharp a turn, then they tag you which most likely will stun you and then
the whole pack get's to play a bit of payback. A second stun during this is
not normally recoverable from.
