Jekke sorta got it, early in his longish post a few steps down the
thread.  As you point out, the old models are just as absurd in terms
of the proportions of the females, and certain of the armor types are
are perhaps even more absurd, but...  the more obvious cartoonishness
of the old models makes them a lot less noticeable, they disappear
from my inner eye and don't disturb the vision my imagination creates
of the virtual environment.  The much more realistic art of the new
models actually breaks the immersion, frequently jerking my attention
out of the flow of the game and demanding that I notice their studied
insult to my intelligence.  When everything is obviously unreal it is
easier, for instance, to ignore the idiocy of many of the helmets (you
know, all those stupid protrusions to catch your opponent's weapon so
that even the most glancing of blows is likely to break your neck).
