  Where does this notion come from that we're paying Verant as some sort of
"reward" for their service?  It's not like I'm sending a niece a $12.95
check for getting straight A's on her report card.

  To me, the overall EQ experience is worth $12.95/month (though I pay a bit
less than that since I prepaid).  That doesn't mean that I think VI is
perfect and flawless, or even entirely competent.  The time I spend
exploring and fighting in a new or interesting area with my friends is what
I'm paying for, and to me, those types of experiences are worth
$12.95/month, and make the frustrations that come with dealing with
ill-tested game mechanics and bad CS worth enduring.

  I don't think it's an extremely difficult concept to grasp.
