Hi Fooboy

I've used Mappie for a while. At first just to make the map lines dark 
enough to show up on my screen.

Then they added a compacting routine to remove surplus or overlapping 
lines. This halved the size of the GuK maps I use.

With V1.3 and the bug fixes in V1.4 it now has a usable but quirky edit 
facility. Add, remove lines and a freehand line drawer (If your not very 
steady with a mouse as I'm not, it has limited use)

So far I have used it to edit my GuK maps like put the bridges into the 
right place and change their colour and completed some walls.

The point editor works on exact /Locate co-ordinates rather than 'plonk' 
a point. But is still very useful as it lists all the points in a menu. 
Good for spotting the 2 identical ones that got overlaid on each other 
while editing in game in a hurry.

The only tool I need that is in the EQ map editor is the line joining 
routine. though I expect that to turn up soon.

As for route mapping NPC's and spawns. I hadn't thought of that. It 
should be okay, you just need to select an appropriate colour. Because 
as far as I can see there is no facility in the maps to have dotted or 
lines of differing thickness.

The line editors quirks would work in your favour as drawing a single 
convoluted line with no need to join it to any other line is what it 
does best at the moment.

Otherwise I still prefer to use the EQAtlas maps. As I can draw all over 
them without losing half the screen to the mapping screen.

But the in game maps have the edge if you are lost. As the little arrow 
soon shows that you really shouldn't be where you are at all <grin>
