What, exactly, do you mean by "cheapening the
game"?

How would it impact on the way that you play the
game now, bearing in mind that there are already
players around who have bought their characters.

If you could only buy your way to lvl 20 or 30,
would you still object?

What is their "supposed philosophy", in regard to
this?

As far as I can see, their philosophy is rubbery
enough, to take any shape that furthers the flow
of dollars into their coffers, anything beyond
that, is projection from players.

My gut feeling is that they probably shouldn't
sell pre-made characters, but I cannot find any
concrete objections as to why they shouldn't.

Some of the reasoning seems to be... "I had to do
it the hard way, so everyone should do it the hard
way".
