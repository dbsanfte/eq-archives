Ah!  Thank you (and Faned, and -martin).  I wasn't around at the time
of the nerf, so I only knew about it from reading old threads, and I'd
gotten the impression that the reason the "mitigation nerf" caused monks
to take more damage was because that's when the AC softcap got added.
I didn't realise the softcap was already there from before.

So they're talking about leaving in the softcap, but doing away with the
additional mitigation?

Also, how does the mitigation nerf apply?  Does it make more of a
difference at high levels, or do monks take proportionally more
damage at all levels?
