These are not necessarily synonymous.

Charmed pets are often the best damage producers, mobs tend to do much 
better than summoned pets, since they're balanced for facing a group of 
six characters their level.

Enchanters and bards can charm a wider variety of mobs, however 
necromancers can charm undead, druids can charm animals, and mages can 
charm summoned mobs.  So depending on zone and level, any of the above 
might be up near the top of the game.

BUT bards can't haste their charmed pets, unless perhaps the AA which 
allows songs to land on pets works on charmed pets, which would be 
interesting.  I think mages have the best pet only buff, so in zones 
where the best charmable mob happens to be summoned, mages probably have 
the highest DPS pet in the game.

Barring charmed pets, I think Mages arguably have the best pets, because 
they have more flexibility; they can pull up a pet best suited to the 
combat.  Water pets have backstab and can really put out some good DPS 
if they can be kept in the rear of the mob, which is to say a strong 
tank who's willing to dance with the mob, or fear or aggro kiting; necro 
pets share that ability though.  Fire pets, high level ones anyway, put 
out some substantial fire based nuke damage if the mob doesn't resist 
too much, and have a nice sized DS at any level, if you're using them to 
tank, and particularly on mobs which are immune or highly resistant to 
melee and nuke DPS.  The earth pet, to be frank, is a loser with low 
DPS, but handy if you need to have it tank, with relatively high HP 
total and root to assist in retaining aggro.  The air pet is a personal 
favorite, with good mitigation, decent DPS, and
