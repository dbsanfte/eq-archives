Easiest way, is to get a port to NK, and you can be bound at the Gypsy
camp. But, it might just be easier for you to hang on to all your
stones, in the bank, and take them there when you're high enough level.
The route that I take to get from Commons to the Karanas is always
through Runnyeye and Beholder's Maze (Gorge of King Xorbb). I've just
always found it to be a better route, for me, than going though
HighPass. If you go to www.eqatlas.com there is (at least used to be) a
page that will run you through how to get from Freeport to Qeynos, and
you can follow those directions to get to NK.
