Ok Dan, and thanks for the response! I've been searching the web, haven't
even looked at mags. Mostly I wanted some info on what the production
process is like. I expect it isn't as much fun for the actors as it is for
us, since they're mostly sitting/working in blue screen, except, perhaps,
for the outside stuff (and NZ is a *wonderful* location... always wanted to
go, but had to love it through National Geographic). If anyone has a site
for the "how we did this" of the movie, I'd appreciate a heads up! Just want
to know how it was made, and how the computer graphics were utilized, if I
can even *find* that!

thanks,
Darklet
