Isn't that a bit risky, in that if you get in trouble, you don't have the
option to gate out?  Perhaps it would be better to bind a 20 or 30 second
run away, so if you have to gate out of a bad fight, there is time to mem
and cast a port out before the mob gets back to you.

(At higher level, this isn't a problem, because Abscond has the same casting
time as gate, so when binding in the zone I'm fighting, I mem Abscond
instead of Gate).
