Chip on your shoulder, sport?  You must fit my description: ding
shouter!

We all enjoy the game, or we wouldn't keep coming back to it, but if you
think making a level is such a great accomplishment that you need to
shout
it out to a group of total strangers who are busily engaged in their own
business, you need to reexamine your self image.  We don't care who you
think you are, and we are less than impressed with your
"accomplishment."
Tell your group if you need your back slapped, but don't presume the
rest
of us are interested.  And no, this is not because we are self-absorbed
cynical bastards, we're just not members of your family, nor do we want
to be. Tell it to your group or guild members, but the rest of us will
think you're just a dipshit if you shout out your so-called
accomplishment to the whole zone.

I suppose my group should now start shouting "We just took down
ubermob01, we are hot!"  How do you suppose people would react?
("Shut up, you morons!")

I liken this sort of thing to a stranger approaching me on the street
and shouting:  "It's my birthday!" or "I just got a pay raise!" or "My
wife just bought a new negligee!"  All these events might possibly be
worth celebrating (if a friend made the announcement), but not with a
group of total strangers.  Personally, I would try real hard to keep
such a nut at arms length.

People who shout "Ding" are just this type of nut; and those oh-so
sincere people who shout 'Gratz" in return are bigger ones.
