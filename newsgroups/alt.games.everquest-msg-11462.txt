About the only "froglok Paladin" I know of is the Shin Lord himself.
This is further bolstered by the wording of the message from Verant,
which talks of question from a "froglok paladin" instead of
killing "*the* poor chap".  Sounds like they're talking about the
same guy you used to have to kill for it.

So with good Froglok faction (which most Paladins have to start with
until they start hunting in Guk), you should be able to just waltz
right in and (h)ail him, and presumably get some quest instructions
from him.
