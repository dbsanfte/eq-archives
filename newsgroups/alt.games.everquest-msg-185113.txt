Ive been hunting in Dulak ALOT lately with my shadow knight and
noticed something unusual last night (not that this really has
anything to do with Dulak). When quaffing down a strength potion my
girlfriend's shammy made (forgot the name of it), her haste spell
refused to land on me. When clicking it off, it landed just fine (yet
my druid's storm strength caused no problems). Oh, but it gets better.
Having just returned from de-looting and having her charisma buff on,
certain shadow knight spells refused to take hold, notably Shadow
Vortex and Shroud of Hate. Once i popped off the charisma buff, all
was fine. Is this an intended feature? If so, why the heck? Why would
a charisma buff prevent an AC or Atk drain from landing (and why a str
potion prevent haste)?
