Possibly, if the data that /needed/ to be transferred exceeded the
bandwidth of dial up then yeah.

Otherwise it really wouldn't make a lot of business sense. Dial up
uses less bandwidth than broadband obviously, thus they can have more 
paying customers (who pay the same fee regardless of the speed they connect 
at) that don't suck as much bandwidth as broadband users.

If you cut out dial up users, that's a lot of lost money, and that's what 
it's all about.
