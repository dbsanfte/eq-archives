Yes, I think there should be an advisory on every game.  Something that
would warn parents or those prone to become addicted to stuff that EQ may
not be a game they would want in their house.

It's already rated 13+ (I think) and that's fine, but it doesn't give enough
information.

Disclaimer: I'm about to make statements with nothing to back it up, but I
don't think I'm wrong.  Feel free to disagree (like I could stop you :) ).

Consider this - most people who start playing EQ have either not played any
computer games or have played games that bored them after a few weeks.  They
go to the store, see EQ, read the box, decides it looks like an interesting
game, just like their last one, buy it, and take it home.

A year later they're still playing it an average of 20 hours/wk (no idea if
this is right but it's the number people are tossing around).

A warning would have been nice.
