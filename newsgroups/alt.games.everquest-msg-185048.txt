Howdy People.

Well, I gave up EQ over a year ago (due to financial constrictions and my
wife becoming a midwife and needing our *single* phone line more often than
I could tolerate ;-) ).

I still kept in touch with the happenings in Norrath through this NG  and
friends that still play, and noticed that nothing really has changed too
much other than the new expansions. So I was feeling rather smug and pleased
with myself that I had managed to break the habit.

This self-congratulatory feeling dissolved completely several days ago when
I opened Outlook to check my email.
Heading my new email was one from Sony thanking me for "making EQ the mmorpg
that it was today" (their words),
and went on to explain it was mailing me to offer me 1 month FREE
subscription. No need to re-register, I could log on and start playing. They
also said they couldn't guarantee that my old toons would still be active.

So there the email sat for a day in my inbox like a festering pustule. This
was seriously crushing my fine steel willpower. I guess some parts of EQ
will never leave us. After 2 days of this torment, I thought ahh what the
hell and broke out the CD's and re-installed EQ right up to Luclin (Yes, I
uninstalled the damn thing when I quit cold turkey, it's over 1Gb) and
during the following 14 hour download to get up to date, with my wife
complaining about the lack of telephone, I began to wonder if I was doing
the right thing.

The following morning, when I was finally able to log on, I found my old
toons still rotating in the char select screen as if they had never been
banished from my PC. Completely amazed, and with more than a little
trepidation I hit <enter>.

Once again I was in "their world". I took my 56 Iksar monk out for a blast,
soloed a few light blue mobs, answered a few "wtf" tells from old friends
who realised I was back and promptly joined up in a good raiding guild to
see what it was like at the real "high end of the game" (again). It was here
that I hit my first snag, I couldn't join raids for XP 'cos I didn't have
PoP. I could get faction hits but I wasn't in the "XP" group so I gained
precious little else.

So, my question to you all is, should I go buy PoP (LoY is out of the
question until I make my decision whether to stay or not)? Is the addition
of these new zones/skills/AA and level cap all worth it? If so, what is my
reason/argument to my wife going to be? Any suggestions would be appreciated
(Dark Tyger need not apply unless he leaves his flame gun uncocked - did I
mention before that some things always stay the same? :-) ).

Anyway it IS good to be back in Norrath, albeit (maybe) only temporarily.
