7) Dont play a paladin

>
> A few essential things to good plvling:
> 1) a good source of healing.
> 2) a way to do damage that doesn't count against the damage done by the
> plvlee.  failing that, a way to negate the damage done by any party doing
> damage that counts against the plvlee's damage.
> 3) buffs that take the plvlee's HP total way beyond what they should
> normally have.
> 4) don't be an asshole.  if someone comes along that needs the camp more
> than you (ie: they're not being plvl'd and aren't twinked), share the
> camp.   This will help people to not hate you.
> 5) have a very good grasp of the crowd control methods available to you.
> 6) KEI is very helpful.

> In order of importance: 4, 2, 1, 3, 5, 6.

> As a side note: paladins lack any form of #2 that I've ever heard of.
> And at low levels they don't exactly have #1 covered either.
