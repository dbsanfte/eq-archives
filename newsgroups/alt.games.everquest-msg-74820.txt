Other evening I saw a druid with a horse, night before I saw a ranger with a
horse...  funniest thing was, I had some better gear than these people.  A
better fashion statement would be nice and useful gear.

Come on, 20+K for a horse.. or 20K for a set of IGS... or 20K to MQ your
last piece of the Earthcaller... or 20K on a ton of other stuff... which
SHOULD people choose?  Certainly not the horse for the marginal gains.
There were baron/baroness so why didnt they just throw points to running
speed.

Warrior, pally/rogue/cleric/almost any other class?  Ok I can understand a
bit. (Though not the 100K, thats sick)

Whats this Norrath world coming to?

I give, horse or no horse, hack and slash is hack and slash.
