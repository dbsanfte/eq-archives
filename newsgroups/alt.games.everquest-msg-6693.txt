How is this cheating?  Looking up information is not cheating, it is an
intregral part of the game.  Surely Verant would have known that as the
world becomes more explored that people would compile information on it, and
probably they actually hoped they would to make up for the dismal manual
that was provided with it.  I use a second computer to look up information
online while I play so I dont have to bug people around me with stupid
questions.  In my newbie days it made me a popular newbies with the
non-newbies when I would only ask a question that even stumped them :-)
Instead of stupid questions like what is a CR or SOW.
