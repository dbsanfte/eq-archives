It's getting there ;-)  I've settled in with the notion of being in pay
beta's now since, oh...Ultima Online.  It's new, it's buggy, theres some
probs - nothing new here.

I personally love the setting and didn't really want or have to give up
anything else.  If anything it just expands the horizon of options in
MMOG's.  I personally think the graphics kick ass, but I'm soooo looking
forward to the Luclin enhancements in EQ too.  I am a sucker for the eye
candy.  Funny, AC's look made me go 'yuck' after playing EQ for awhile in
beta and after it launched.

Only if you sell *me* the Wiz =)

*shakes the magic 8 ball*

Should be a sure thing if you figure the ride they can get off of just the
subscriptions of players who have bought/played/quit immediately.  As with
other pay-for-beta games I've been a part of, they usually aren't in the
business of losing money and will do everything within their power to keep
people subscribing, AO and Funcom being no different.

Luclin coming out, can't remember when the Dark Ages of Camelot goes
beta..hard to say.  Lot's of cool things in the pipeline for the next 6
months.  I think the big 3 that are out there right now (AC/UO/EQ) will
retain core subscription numbers, as far as what's going to be better, well
that's what's fun about being a player right now.
