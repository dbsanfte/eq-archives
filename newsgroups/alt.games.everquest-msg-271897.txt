There aren't 3 instances, there are 3 hedges.  3 Hedge events can be going
on at the same time.  Thelin transports 3 groups to the first hedge event,
the next 3 to the 2nd hedge event, etc.

It was horribly bugged at the start (no surely not!) with groups and group
members being sent to random hedges.
