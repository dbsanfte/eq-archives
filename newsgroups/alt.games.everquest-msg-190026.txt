Playing a ranger, I definitely get my fair share of fizzles on things like 
superior camo (divination over 200 and I still get 5 fizzles in a row about 
every 5th time I try to cast it), and now Drones of Doom (conjuration also 
over the 200 mark, but it fizzles even more than sup. camo).  Not once have 
I ever seen a skill increase on a fizzle.  And back before I trained up my 
divination, I'd go over 30 fizzles on superior camo quite regularly.

Not hard evidence, but when I do succeed on the lower level casts, my 
skills go up rather quickly.  So if you *can* get skillups on fizzles, it's  
really quite incredibly rare.
