MQing goes like this: You, the person with the SEoC, gives the item to
the NPC and the person with the other part gives their part after you
have handed in yours. They then receive the resulting quest item.

I've have the SEoC MQed for me. Have the person doing their epic
hail the NPC and go through the conversation and tell you when to
give the SEoC to her. Then verify that you've given it to her before
they hand in their part.
