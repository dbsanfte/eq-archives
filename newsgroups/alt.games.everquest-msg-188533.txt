}Well, I ran it again last night, and had the same result - the investigator

Aye, the investigator never followed me either, did the whole thing 
running back and forth.  Never saw the guards actually arrest anyone.  
Just to be sure, did you target 'an investigator' and say, "where is the 
third suspect?"  I assume you know, but just to be sure, the writeup at
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1271 is very helpful.

}My level is 54 BTW. From what I can see, I don't expect to have much
}difficulty solo'ing things until I get to the final piece. Even then I could
}probably solo or at least duo that piece, but I think I'm going to see if
}the guild wants to make a fun night of doing the war.

Yea, been wanting to try that part, I feel guilty wiping out the town. :)  
First time we did it we enlisted the aid of the other two folks in the 
zone and tried to hold them off with just 5 people, but we got overwhelmed 
pretty quick.  The gnolls come from all directions, not just one, so it's 
hard to even spot them before they lunch a townie with so few peoples.
