>I think at times, its a player knowing when to say.. "woooo this is
>not going to work" that helps.

I *wished* the MT had said that, I'd have chimed right in.  I *did* point out
that it was going to be a long haul if the chanter couldn't mez the adds.  The
chanter never offered any explanation of why she couldn't get them mezzed, even
when I made my statement.  After the next group of mobs got pulled *she*
suggested we call it quits, and I quickly agreed.
I had stopped having fun while we waited 22 minutes for her to show up.... and
thats a fact.  
Thanks for all the opinions / suggestions.
