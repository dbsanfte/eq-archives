Stats are VERY important durring character creation

Rules to live by:

1. Always put as many points as possible into your "primary" stat if
the Class has one.
Examples:
 INT casters (Wiz, Mage, Ench, Necro)
 WIS casters (Dru, Sham, Cler)

2. Any Stat less than 75 will cause a penalty. 
Example: 
If Agility is below 75 your character will have an AC (armor class)
penalty and be hit more often.

Paladins (Wis), Rangers (Wis), and ShadowKnights (Int) have to try to
balance thier primary stats against thier melee stats. Since they are
Hybrids they have tougher decisions to make.

Monks and Bards can pretty much do what they want with their character
points as long as they make sure none of thier melee stats (STR, STA,
AGIL, DEX) are below 75
