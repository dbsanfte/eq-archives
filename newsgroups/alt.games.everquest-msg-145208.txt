Mobs NEVER lose agro.   Assuming you could even run away (AND keep your pet
off the mob and running with you) in the first place.

Im sorry but thats some HUGE if's and buts.. thats not a reliable or
realistic technique

Oh please.  I play a monk 25/7 in a high end raiding guild as a main puller,
I know how agro works better than the average player

Camps are a popular spot for people to hunt.. the lack of having to search
around for pulls means increased kill-rate (thus more exp overall)

If you get 2 higher level cons pop near to each other, how are you to know
before you pull 1 and get the pair?  Or worse, some kind of crappy pathing
chain agros even more mobs..

deal

Its also about moving TO the fight spot.. I'll give you a very valid
scenario (imo)..  mage is bound in FV, is going to hunt in BW.

Id go FV-DL-BW.  If I get agro in DL I may or may not need to get (depends
if I got a sow or not).. now im in BW, the place is a mix of dead and
undead.. mobs that run at sow speed..  lets say my hunting location happens
to be the giant fort, or the undead camp near to it.

What happens if I agro even a single mob?  Yeah you guessed it, I cross my
fingers that gate channels, and I start the 10 minute run back again.
Traveling invis is generally safer than non-invis with a pet up, but if I do
get agrod, I have NO defence other than gate.

As a cleric.. well lets see, I root them.. I fear them..  If they are near
the camp I do one of the above and camp momenterily. If they were a good
deal away, I don't even bother.

> I don't pull them in the first place, and I fight where
> there are no roamers; adds are a waste of mana and

Please tell me spots in various 50-60 zones where I will NEVER get adds,
please.

I hunted in BW for about 5 hours straight, with no adds (so its not like im
not cautious about these things)  then the mage/bard epic wurm spawned,
pathed right through my camp, and made me gate.  In the process I lost my
camp, my aego'd pet, a great deal of mana, 15-20 mins time (in running back
and re-medding), and a high level pet that took me 8 or so summons to make.

Im obviously doing something wrong tho, if I haven't found a spot with ZERO
chance of adds ever.. so id appreciate your input into where im going wrong

> I did play a mage to 28, soloed a good deal of that.

Thats all good and well, and im not talkng specifically about 50+.. but its
where im coming from now (where the whole dynamics of the game changes
imo).. you have a 60 char, u know yourself level 28 isn't even a patch on
how things are in the 50+ crowd
