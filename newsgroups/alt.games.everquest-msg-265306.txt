This ends the discussion. I remmebr the 20% inflation under Carter. If
that is your idea of a good administration, you do have a warped
political view.

The Ideal is a man who can lead decisivly, and can be trusted not to
flap in the wind. A president is a like a sailor. He has to set a good
course and not waste energy turning the ship of state. Clinton and
Carter did nothing but turn, Bush I turned some but Reagan kept the
course and led us to a great economy.

Kerry will be a disaster, if big money wins and he is elected. I don't
mind my words being marked.
