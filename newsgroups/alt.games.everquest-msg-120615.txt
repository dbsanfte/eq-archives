Sounds like the spell icons have moved off screen for some reason. 

Look for the EQCLIENT.INI file in the main EQ directory. Make a backup
copy of the file and put it in another folder. 

Edit the EQCLIENT.INI file in wordpad or notepad. Towards the bottom
of the file will be the box/window locations for the different screen
resolutions. Delete the entries under 800x600, and save the file. 

Launch EQ. When the game comes up the EQCLIENT.INI file should
automatically recreate the default layout for the full screen
boxes/windows for 800x600. You should then be able to resize and move
them all back to where you want them.

If that doesn't work you can always restore the EQCLIENT.INI file from
the backup you made.
