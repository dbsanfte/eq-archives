Someone posted that the 10-day Free Demo that comes with a computer magazine
is on its very own server.  The person who posted is a regular poster and
experienced it for himself so I tend to believe it.

If it is the case (which I assume it is) then the name of the server is
totally unimportant, as no one but the freebies can visit it.
