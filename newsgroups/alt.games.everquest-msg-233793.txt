On the top level of Katta is a mansion with two guards and two wolves
outside.  Killing them gives positive faction to Validus Custodius (probably
butchered the spelling - that is Katta guard faction), Sanctus Seru, and the
Vamps in Tenebrous.  Their are on Nathyn Illuminatus faction which, as far
as I know, is only applicable in that mansion, so these are great to kill
faction wise because it improves your Katta and Seru factions while only
making you KoS in that one little mansion.  Loot is ok - a several gold to
several plat and normally a sword that sells for 3-4pp.  The shields might
sell for more, but they are Lore so you can't make much off of them unless
you're going to sell after every kill.  Some of the Katta guards will rarely
drop a magic item like a girdle, but I don't think I've seen these drop off
Nathyn's guards.  At 56, I think you can pull singles until you become KoS.
At 57, you can pull singles even KoS as long as you don't get too close.
Get too close and both guards will aggro.  Your normal targets would be the
guards/wolves in front and the guards in the front room.  XP is very, very
slow compared to PoP, but it can be a nice place to grind out some AAXP
(probably 1% a kill at 56/57).  I've read that Seru guards usually drop a
sword that sells for 21pp, but I've never killed a Seru guard.
