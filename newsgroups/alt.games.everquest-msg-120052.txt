Well, you snipped it, so here it is...

"If the porter in question isn't willing to just come out and tell the
person how much they want for a port, then no, it isn't wrong.  If
you're going to leave it up to the people who want the port, you have
to realize that they are probably going to try and make the best deal
for themselves that they can.  Which is ok, because it's not really
other players responsibilty to watch out for YOUR finances. "

It's simple logic. You condone the act, therefore it only stands to
reason that you would be willing to commit it. When exposed to an
honor system (a druid offering to port you for a donation), you would
take advantage of it. It goes without saying that the donation should
be reasonable.

Supply and demand. If more people refused to pay it and decided
instead to hoof it, then it would be lower. Fact is, it's worth it to
most people needing a port, and people have shown they are willing to
pay it.

If you didn't get it earlier, I hope I got it across with this post.

Again, it's common sense and common knowledge what a port costs. You
can either pay what it's worth (within reason) or take advantage.
Those are the only two choices.

I don't see where you get that, but no, I'm not. I'm just saying that
the level of your druid is irrelevant in this matter.
