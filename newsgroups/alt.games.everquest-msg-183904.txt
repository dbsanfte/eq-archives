I suppose that is possible, maybe, (scary thought) but
Xnews isn't one of those programs. It may may not be
as "pretty", but Xnews stomps a mud hole in OE. GNKSA
(http://www.xs4all.nl/~js/gnksa/gnksa-evaluations.html) certainly thinks
so, 100% compliance versus OE version 4.71.1712.1's 85%.  I'm being
nice, later versions of OE had steadily decreasing scores.

Xnews does have a pretty steep learning curve. But almost all good
software does.

You are. Xnews supports this also. You just need to set a different
font, or at least set it to the same font but bolded. Personally I have
it set to a different color. BTW, I know I posted this using rtin. I'm
using Linux right now. When I'm in Windows I use Xnews. And yes, Xnews
does work under WineX, but I don't think it is as stable that way. EQ
works under WineX also. One less reason to use Windows. :-)
