    Nothing gets multiple slots except for LDoN items. Not epics that can be
done on a weekend, not Time loot that takes months of work to get to,
nothing. It's the big hook for the expansion, and it's fine by me - the
expansion items might last a bit longer against mudflation that way.

    It's only 50 more spaces, to 550. Still filled by night on my server,
bleh. And since The Bazaar shares the same hardware as Time-A, forming up
raids there is getting worse and worse with the lag. Double-bleh.

    I like them, although some find them a bit cartoony and overdone. Like
the two hander animation on them, where they literally end their stroke with
their hands banging against the ground. The glowing eyes has been a big hit.

    The change has been to make them named foci effects, instead of
"background" effects that you need a spoiler site to know about. They also
renamed many of the existing foci effects to more obvious names, like the
"Aura of Health, Aura of Regeneration" etc. series to "Regeneration X",
where X is the HPs/tick.

    I imagine they just wanted a simple mechanism to get them in place, and
the two-slot combine box they use is pretty simple. Would be nice if they
changed it to what you state, but I wouldn't hold my breath for it.
