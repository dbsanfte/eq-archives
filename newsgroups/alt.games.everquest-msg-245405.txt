Hehehe.  You actually saw me PL'ing my druid twink on a different account
(check Monual's Chain Reaction for details).  I forgot that after Orc Hill
we moved into Crushbone briefly before moving on to Paludial Caverns.
Crushbone was just too crowded, and I didn't want to take mobs away from
people who were actually leveling up themselves.

Good luck with the new character.  =)  One thing I haven't had the courage
to do is create a character on a new server.  Gosh, without any plat or
power-leveling, how could he survive?  Eep!

I've been spoiled.  =)  Taking over a year to go from 1-60 was fun and
interesting.  Once.  Can't imagine doing it that way again.  This also
explains why I don't play any other MMORPG's - I've gotten pretty uber in
EQ, I don't want to have to begin at the beginning again.

So I admire you for starting over - and over - creating new characters and
still finding fun from them.  I'd be too impatient.
