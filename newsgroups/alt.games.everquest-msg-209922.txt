Meanwhile we trust Jelan will never do "naughty things"? Meanwhile 
somone else out there either reverse engineers or replicates his efforts?

Far better to release the source, and let SOE tighten their security if 
their is a hole there that needs fixxing. Unless of course Jelan doesn't 
wan't Magelo competition... which is entirely reasonable, but then say 
that instead of some ill-conceived flutter about how he's doing EQ a 
favour...

The characters are stored on the server, I don't see much liklihood of 
someone modifying the client copy affecting the server copy... and for 
the most part I think EQ has eliminated client side hacks. And if they 
haven't: far better to expose and close them, then to let it linger 
while a few script kiddies exploit it for a few months under the radar 
before its widespread enough that we someone finally gets caught.
