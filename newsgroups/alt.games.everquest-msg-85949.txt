/shudder

I was once in a group where the Cleric managed to keep
healing the people WHO WERE AT FULL HEALTH, and not the
ones who weren't.

I might have blamed this on his being flustered during
combat, but he kept doing this during downtime as well.

The funny part is that we were doing well enough even
without heals that we kept him around for amusement
value.
