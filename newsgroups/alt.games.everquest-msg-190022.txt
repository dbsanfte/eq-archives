Ahhhh, I'll let the girlfriend know that.  She found out about it 6 
months ago and still hasn't gotten over it.

I *loved* their chicken sandwiches.  Especially when they had the $.99 
thing going for 'em.  Now I make similar stuff at home with fake chicken 
from Morning Star Farms.  Just tried Quorn products, but found out 
they're made from a fungus that has made quite a few people sick.

Can't say I've ever heard of 'em :/

I like to add some fake chicken chunks to my pasta w/ some variety of 
marinara sauce.  I'll skip the anchovy paste though.  And I still have 
yet to find a caesar dressing w/o anchovies.  Finally found some 
worchestshire (or however that's spelled) that's vegetarian this week.

There's a healthy enough variety of fake meat products out there that I 
don't miss it too bad.  You have to understand that I'm not exactly 
vegetarian by choice.  My current girlfriend has been vegetarian for over 
9 years now and, if I want to get kissed, that means I don't eat meat 
either :P
