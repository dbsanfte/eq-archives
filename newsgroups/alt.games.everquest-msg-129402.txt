You have to remember the prevailing attitude that Israelis are brought up
with in regards to Arabs.  In Israel the common expression for shoddy work
is to say it is "Arab work".   Of course, on the other hand, most Arabs are
taught to hate Israel from early childhood, it's just the way things are in
that region at this point in time.  There are some people on both sides that
are trying to overcome this, but, given the general attitude on both sides,
it's a pretty monumental task.  Personally, I would like to see us (the US,
and other countries with influence) put a lot more pressure on Israel to
work towards peace.  The US is currently providing Israel with a very
significant amount of money in the form of cash and weapons and technology.
We should be placing very significant requirements in exchange for providing
this.  I would like to see us, and other countries pony up some carrots for
the Palestinians, in the form of major incentives to work towards peace.  If
the average Palestinian had hope of things actually changing for them, in
the form of a state of Palestine actually existing that would be able to
have a real economy, and actually provide the vast majority of people with a
way to make a living, I think that you would find that the violence would si
gnificantly decrease.  As things currently stand, the Palestinians in
general don't see any way for this to happen, they live in abject poverty
with no hope, perfect breeding grounds for the type of violence that is
occuring there now.  While it is not true that all terrorists come from such
a background, there are certainly some that are well educated, and well off
financially, the vast majority of them do come from such a background, where
they have no hope.
