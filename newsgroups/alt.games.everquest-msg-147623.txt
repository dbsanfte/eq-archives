Rezes and Quests Prior to the implementation of AA I used to Sacrifice my 52
Warrior everytime he got close to 53 for cash or Guild members. I keep him
at 52 for Vox raids. I have heard that the rez is 90% with no rez time
limit, and there is an Exploit (not sure if it works) that if a Corpse goes
over the 3 hour rez timer you can sacrifice yourself and have the Cleric rez
the Sacrificed Corpse and use the Essence Emerald to rez the old Corpse.
Both corpses have to be in the same zone. Never tried it or have actually
talked to someone that has, just a rumor
