Many mobs pop on or shortly after a pop.  The only time you know for sure they
will be up is right after a patch.  So its possible to actually schedule raids
on them for these days, gather your forces in advance, log in when the patch is
completed, and go  to town.

When a patch is bugged and the servers go down again, there is much rejoicing...
because those repatches often take only a few minutes and boom, your mob pops
again, with you all there buffed and ready to go kill it.  Mob that you would
see once in a couple months if you relied on a tracker happening to notice its
up and not already being killed by another guild, post patch you might get it a
couple times in one day.

Having the extraordinarily bad luck to have that patch hit during the actual
kill (kills usually only take a few minutes on most mobs) or looting (that,
sadly, often takes longer than the kill) is just the price you pay for knowing
for sure the mob is going to be there in the first place.

That said, bitching about it happening is inappropriate, you pays your money and
you takes your chances.  You -can- however rail at your ill fate as a way of
blowing off steam.
