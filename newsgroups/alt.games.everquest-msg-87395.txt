ok....i was wondering at what level do rogues get "evade" skill. I
didnt see it on the list of future training possibilities and wondered
if it was a skill that just showed up at the right level like thge
beastlord summon cat skill does. Well, after asking my guild one of
our rogues stopped me on my way out of nektuolos to tell me a few
things.

Make a social hotkey and name it evade.

/attack off
/doability 2      (i have hide in skill slot #2)
/attack on

And thats all there is. Now i gotta keep hide and sneak maxed and when
I get aggroed (mostly from my failed backstab attempts) I hit the
evade key and it says "You have momentarily ducked out of battle".
Cool feature. And now...more questions.

1) Do doors have a "level" assigned to them for success rates of your
lockpicking skill the way a monsters level affects whether you can hit
it or not? I practiced on the door in befallen until it wouldnt go
over 75....probably cause im 14th level. I went to Efp to try to pick
the lock downstairs in the store there and all it would say is that im
not skilled enough. If i keep clicking on it forever will i ever get a
level up?

2) Same thing for pick pocket. Can i skill up from trying to
pickpocket the beggar in Efp or from orc pawns?

Also, I bought a Shardwurm Stinger 10 dam 40 delay and to my dismay
noticed that it was secondary slot only. Any recomendation about high
damage low delay piercers out there? I was intending to use a couple
hot swap icons in my list with an inventory slot next to my primary
weapon. I could make a backstab with the big and slow one then quickly
trade weapons to get more hits in until backstab recycles then put
swap them back out again. Any idea if this would work? I dont have one
yet buy my fear is that even if i swap a very slow for a very fast one
it will still be pretty slow for the first attack after.......but that
may not make a difference until the next backstab. Hehehe....im having
fun playing a rogue.
