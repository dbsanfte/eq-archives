Might be half your trouble - need Direct X 8.1, not 8.0

You might also want to check that you have the latest drivers for your video
card, or even try a few different version drivers.  Also, some have found
that their computers are not taking advantage of the extra RAM.  To do this,
insert the line (without the apostrophes):

'ConservativeSwapfileUsage=1'

into your SYSTEM.INI file under the [386Enh] section.

I can probably agree, but then a lot of games are rated by their graphics.
What really should have happened was a lot more testing, as it is not really
a problem of too low memory, but of compatibility with drivers.
