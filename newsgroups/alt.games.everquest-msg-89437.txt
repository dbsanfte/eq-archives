I dispute those findings.  Though with the rarity of procs, it's pretty 
hard to quantify without literally hours of testing.  I would say that 
increasing you DEX from 100 to 200 increases you DAMAGE OUTPUT by 2% or so 
would be true.  Remember, for most melee classes proc damage is a very 
small percentage of total damage output.
