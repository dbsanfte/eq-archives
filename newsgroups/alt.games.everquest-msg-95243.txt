Yes.

Yes, the keys are to open doors, not activate portals.

Key to north wing is a tallow candle that drops from the sperm.  You
shouldn't have to fight at zonein very long before you get one.

Nothing in HS is random.  There are some ground spawn keys, but usually to
locked doors within the same wing where you pick it up.  I think all the
wing keys are dropped.  Trying to remember how south-to-east-wing works off
the top of my head, as that might be the one ground spawn wing key.

Easy way to tell if *anything* is a key.  Walk up to a door, any door, with
it on your cursor.  Click.  Did the door open or did you get a "drop this?"
box?  Keys are pretty hard to drop.

North wing's "zone out" takes you back to the center platform.  West wing's
"zone out" takes you back to the center platform.  South has two "zone outs"
one "out" and one back to the center platform.  East has a zone out to
outside, and I *think* it has a port pad back to center, but honestly I've
never stepped on it to see what it does.

See above.  Mostly you have to go back to zonein to move to the next wing,
and usually you don't have to fight anything (except zonein guards) to do
it.

Lots of mobs on lower level.  The port pad in the middle of the zone that
all traps lead to takes you 50 feet straight up, the same place as all the
other in-zone port pads.  Easiest way to not hit any pit traps is don't step
on any carpets and always levitate.  The basement actually isn't a bad place
to grind if you're not having any luck with keys/rogue or just don't want to
bother with it.
