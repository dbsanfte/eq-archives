	I don't think the perversions EQ has been put through to satisfy the
demands of munchkins can be called 'nurturing' by any stretch of the
imagination.

|    You might be surprised exactly how few people would be around.

	No, I wouldn't.

	The vast majority of EQ players will never have a level 60 character,
never mind level 65.  If everyone in a munchkin guild were to quit today, the
actual reduction in players would be near negligible -- and that's including
the multiple accounts.

|a_new_toy01 drops, suggest that it be looted by a random person as a token

	Under current circumstances, that would be stupid, of course.
