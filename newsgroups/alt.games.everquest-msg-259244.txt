1.  Only mobs below 50 are light blue at 65.
2.  Mobs below 55 and more than 5 levels below you don't give an XP 
bonus. (the lowest mob that gives the bonus gives a 1.95 bonus)
3.  Most classes can't solo mobs close in level to them (6 of 16 can -
Necros, Shaman, Druids, Wizards, Bards and Enchanters)
4.  A full group boosts the base xp of a mob over 2X

Level 50 mob for a solo 58 in a 119 ZEM zone = 50x50x119 = 297,500 XP
Level 62 mob in a 119 ZEM zone for 6 level 65's = 62x62x119x2.16x2.34/6 
= 385,344 XP per player per kill.

So, each member of a group of 65's gets substantially more XP per kill 
than the 58 soloing 50's, and they have a higher kill rate.  (6 pre-
elemental 65's kill level 62 mobs at ~35 mobs per hour in PoV back cave,
HoH and BoT - according to EQWatcher's reports while I was grinding 
there).

With a good group (pre-elemental) you can do better than an AA an hour 
in PoV BC+half of FC, and in the Sewers (purifying plant).  Once you're
flagged for Vxed and/or Elementals it gets way better.  

There is no way to get that sort of XP at 58 unless you're being carried
by a group of 65's in PoV.
