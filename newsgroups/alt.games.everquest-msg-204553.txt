The standard, oh so obvious, answer is HGs in Rathe Mtns.  You
could easily net 300pp in 2-3 hours even at L34 solo, or join a
group and kill with less risk.  At that point, less than halfway
thru 34 and with cash in hand for your 39 spells, you could go
far away to have fun, somplace not frquented by the KSing Bards
and other lamers drawn to RM like moths to a flame.
