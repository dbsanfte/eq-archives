I use EQ Watcher (a real time log parser [*]) and have it set to watch
for enrage messages.  It's a little misleading in raids, however, where
we have many pets.  A lot of pet owners don't watch for enrage, and 
their pets enrage, so I get my comp saying "Enrage" over and over.

The other night we had 4 mages, 2 beastlords and 3 necros in our raid,
all with pets high enough to enrage.  If our current prospects stick with
us and one of our folks who's out at the moment comes back, we'll have
8 61+ mages in the guild.  Now we just need to get our beastlords to make
more raids.  I'm leveling my BL on my 2nd account, as much for the
spiritual line for raids as for the fun of having a 2 box combo with slows,
2 pets and good DPS.

[*] for those who are inclined to slam me about EQ Watcher, I'd refer
you to the post made by Scott Hartsman on the Magician's Tower (the
thread regards audible signals for tells) in which he said 

"Hey there. :) 

Anything whose sole interaction (from EQ's point of view) is to read a log 
file isn't something that we really get excited about. 

When people start screwing with memory and/or net ..."

Basically EQW gives me audible warnings of important events (tells,
messages in the raid pet channel, BOV wearing off and enrage) and times my
mod rods for me.
