1) If looting your corpse, does the money that you pick up get autosplit
with your part?

2) How does group XP work? Is it advantageous to group for leveling
purposes? For example, if something cons blue to me, my High Elf Paladin
of Level 11 (who is wearing some nifty Teir'Dal armor, looking very
sharp) can probably kill it on his own, getting all the XP. But if that
same beast is killed in a group, isn't that XP diluted by being spread
amongst all members of the group? What part of the equation am I
missing?

I don't want this anger that's burning in me.
It's something from which it's so hard to be free.
But none of the tears that we cry in sorrow or rage
Can make any difference, or turn back the page.
