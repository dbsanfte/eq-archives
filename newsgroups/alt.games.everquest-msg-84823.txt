Hint: Look at the enlarged screenshot at the bottom, it says an
"updated" date. I'm betting what you saw there is NOT in game but on
their legends server web site, as is your char profile. So its not
part of the engine I don't think but a place to look at where your
char is on the web and what zones its been to.
I know its ambiguous the way they present it but looking at the
graphic that is the impression I got.

No, absor assured people that these people are fully seperate from the
live server crew. The $39.95 per month is directly used to pay for
them, and the server expense of where the web char info is stored.

He also said that if anything Legends will benefit players on the live
servers in various ways. Like if a quest is really good you can bet it
may be on a live server as a gm event.. but just no more than GM
events already occurr there.

The only thing I really see wrong with this is that if it works well,
it will set a precedent for an OUTRAGEOUS montly mmorpg charge just
for having "good" customer service. It won't bother me on the crap
ones but what if say on something I want to play like Star Wars
Galaxies or Worlds of Warcraft it pushes the subscription price up to
20 or 30 bucks per month?
