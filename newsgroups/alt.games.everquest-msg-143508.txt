I've played mostly low base strength Paladin and Fighter characters,
and at 52 you should have no problem getting your strength up without
using trashy rings.  There're a lot of Warrior armor pieces (weapons
too) that give plus STR as an incidental benefit (you might try
searching the bazaar, filtering for Warrior/slot/STR for items that
are equivalent to what you're wearing already and include STR).

Also, you can get +11 STR, +11STA, and +20HP using food and drink
(Misty Thicket Picnic and Grobb Liquidised Meat).  I started doing
this after I read about it here, and I find it really isn't too much
trouble to keep a stack of food and a stack of water in inventory
slots for regular force-feeding.  I also have a few extra of the
stat food and drink in my food pack (<after> the regular food and
drink) just in case I do forget and accidentally eat the good stuff.
