It's not that simple.

Consider the following similar observation:

  Level 15:  Xp gains - 75
  Level 16:  Xp gains - 71
  Level 17:  Xp gains - 68
  Level 18:  Xp gains - 65

What would you make of *that*?  Gosh, it looks like something's
really out of whack, things got easier across four consecutive
levels.  Something's *really* screwy, eh?

No, actually, that's how many "low blue" (your level minus 5)
kills it took to get through the specified levels under the
original exp curve.  (See: http://eq.stratics.com/crmaps/eqexp.shtml)
At levels 15-18, anything below your level minus 5 gives only
partial (light blue) or no (green) exp.

So what's happening?  The explanation is that at that part of
the exp curve, mob exp is gaining faster per level than is
the amount of exp needed to reach the next level.  You do need
more exp to get through 18 than 17, but the low blue mobs
are worth proportionally more exp each, so you need fewer
of them.

So it's hardly conclusive that it took Jazz fewer mobs to
get through 18 than through 17, because that's possible
even under the old system exclusively.

His varying number of kills per level depends critically
upon what exact mix of mobs he killed each level, and
what level(s) they were.  Without that information, it's
hard to interpret his results at all.  To better illustrate
this:
           L-6   L-5   L-4   L-3   L-2   L-1  Jazz
Level 15:  186    75    62    52    44    38    56
Level 16:  173    71    60    51    44    38    78
Level 17:  162    68    58    50    43    38    82
Level 18:  153    65    56    49    43    38    72

(All calculations done using the pre-patch exp curves,
and a ZEM of 75)

The "L-n" columns show how many mobs of <your current level>
minus "n" you'd have to kill in order to ding out of that
level.  Note that the "L-6" numbers are so much larger than
the others because they're "light blue", and only give 50%
of the exp they would otherwise give.

The "Jazz" column is how many non-green kills Jazz actually
had to kill to get through the level.

From this, it's pretty clear that the real reason for his
original 56/78/82 progression across levels 15-17 wasn't
the fact that the levels required all that much experience
(in fact, level 17 required only 30% more exp than 15,
but he killed 46% more mobs to get it done), it was the
fact that he was fighting, in his own words, pretty much
the same monsters through all the levels, which means,
as you can see by checking where his "kill count" fits
into the L-n columns, he was necessarily fighting more and
more light blues per levels.

In fact, at level 17, the chart conclusively shows that
at least 15+ of his kills had to have been light blue,
giving him only partial exp for a lot of his kills.  This
was not the case for level 15, where you can see that
his number of kills was solidly between the "L-3" and
"L-4" columns, which are fully blue.

It's also interesting to note that EVEN PRIOR TO THE
PATCH, fighting the lowest possible blues exclusively
and avoiding light blue mobs, he would have gotten
through level 18 with as few as 65 kills.  So his
observed "72 kills" is hardly indicative of a sudden
breakthrough in ease of leveling.

His lower kill count for level 18 could be due to *any*
of the following (or a combination of all of them)

1.  While hunting for dark blues (which he admits he
did), he ended up with higher-level monsters on average
than the ones he killed at 15-17, since a lot of the
stuff he had hunted at 15-17 would now be light blue
or even green at this point.  And thus he would need
fewer of them since he had "moved up" to a higher tier
of mob (and thus more exp-per-mob).

2.  The higher dungeon experience modifier which Verant
has announced they have implemented.

3.  *Possibly* a lower exp requirement for level 18
post-patch, although Verant has given *no* indication
that such a change would be made.

Again, without knowing the exact mix of mobs he killed
at each level, it's really hard to say *what* the numbers
might prove.
