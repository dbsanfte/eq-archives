A) If their "theoretical sustained maximum" is lower, they pay less.
B) I was talking about their new network data compression scheme as an
aside, as I really don't think the Bazaar is that much of a bandwidth hog,
though it's quite possible in the sort of spaghetti code that EQ has become
(has become?  hell, started out as) that there are unintended consequences.

C) The "*shrinking* minority of people on sub-56k dialups" is an
across-the-board statement that wasn't specific to EQ.  It's just a
statistical fact.
