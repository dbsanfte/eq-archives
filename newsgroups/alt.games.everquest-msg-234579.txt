The thing that gets lost to most ppl complaining that "losing" the economy
ruins the game is that you honestly dont NEED to go to the bazaar to play
EQ. if the prices are jacked up and the plat pimps are out of control, you
can stop them. the players have the power. stop buying their plat and their
gear, get your own. LDoN has provided us a very nice way of getting decent
gear with nothing more than a bit of our playing time. Maybe if we stop
using the bazaaar and did it like we used to, earn our own gear, this would
be a non issue.
