Well it begs the question:

Since you got specialize at 30, are you sure you've not screwed it up?
Otherwise at 32, soon to be 33, you already SHOULD be at max
specialize alteration... if you ever put like one point into it.

FYI:

In order for specialize to work, you have to put at least ONE POINT 
in all of them. You could put 30 points in alteration and it won't go 
above 50 unless you also put 1 point in all the other ones. So you
might want to put like 6 points in alteration, one in the rest, then
stand there casting a lower level alteration spell that doesn't take
much mana.. A LOT. Like run around and buff some lowbies.

If you messed up your spec and some other one is above 50, you have
to do the quest in sol ro with ostram or someone to reset it so none
are above 50. Then you have to stand around there making sure the one
you want goes above 50.

Once you have it set right it will max quite fast, so you could only
dump points in it if you felt like it. I'd slap some points in sense
direction if yours is not maxxed yet, I find that convenient. It often
seemed to lag behind for me also until I'd dumped some. Its
odd........I have a 39 cleric and never remembered having 100 points
to spend, I always spent them every level on something I needed. I may
have stuck some on 1 h blunt even though it cost a lot sometimes,
don't get a lot of chances to hit stuff as a cleric.
