The big plat came from people using a macro program to record
movements, buttons selected and so forth. Do this with a tradeskill
that nets a small amount of money ad infinitum and you got big money.
Think how long it takes for you to position your cursor over your
equipment bag, select an arrowhead, move it to the fletching kit, drop
it, move to shaft, select it etc. Now think how fast the computer can
do these things. Put it in a continuous loop until you run out of
supplies and start over. I heard people were using a bugged recipe for
cheese and with a certain vendor were making 34K a day in profit. That
was called the 34K macro and its been nerfed. People can get banned
easily for doing this. Go to http://macroquest.sourceforge.net/ for
more info. There is also an article at
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/2345933.stm about how people
doing this stuff has screwed up the EQ economy so that normal people,
just playing the game for fun, cant afford normal stuff. I disagree
though, I think the bazaar has done wonders for people being able to
buy cheap. What was a yak going for a year ago? I think my warrior got
one for 700pp and I damn near puked when I saw one selling in bazaar
for 200pp. Let the dupers and hackers play with the high end uber gear
and clean their banks out with really great stuff for the rest oof us
to buy dirt cheap.
