Yeah, I ran into that one yesterday in Karnor's. We were on the left
ledge and whenever we pulled any of the spectrals, I had to tank at a
very slight angle to them to be able to see them. If I faced directly at
them, they turned invisible and all I could see was the name tag. Same
with the pets. Didn't really affect me, as long as they didnt' run,
because I was still able to hit them just the same. They use the same
graphic as all the ghost types in CoM which I never used to have any
trouble seeing. Minor bug, inconvenience. Put in a feedback and I"m sure
it will get sorted. 

I'm also using an nVidia, by the way. GF2 MX 400.
