wow, someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed.....=P

if someone spends their summer questing something, and at the end, someone
offers them something tons better....

i can see 2 possibilities that are more probable than a kid sitting at his
computer feeling like he wasted his summer...

1) he's proud of the shield he earned and refuses the gift (yes, things like
that do happen in today's world)
2) he looks at the situation positivly - he worked his ass off for a shield,
and even though he gets a crappy one, he gets an outstanding one
soonafter(doesn't matter what slot it is, he's still being rewarded)...it's
dramatic, getting a reward from the sky....



i for one have to sympathize with GetsumJ, since one of my favorite memories
was getting a fine steel rapier in my first week of eq...i could kill around
3 orc pawns, taking them all on at once.....then i lost the rapier giving it
to the banker, instead of putting it in the bank (doh!)

but the point is simply that ignorance is bliss, and there's also a positive
way to look at everything (even ignorance =P )
