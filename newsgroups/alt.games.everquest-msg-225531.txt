I know it wasn't a good direct comparison but given his complete
ignorance of melee I was trying to make it close to something he might
understand.

Given enough time put in, the everfrost ldon dagger was the one I was
thinking of here, with the +2 dmg upgrade. It's about the best non-raid
dagger in the game I think. To get anything better you're talking Cursed
cycle, HP/XtC?, or Sol Ro at a minimum for backstab dps upgrades. I
don't think the rogues in our guild with Ifir or that phase 3 time
dagger see 1100 backstabs.

Bottom line is, rogues haven't been the cuisinarts of death he seems to
think they are since early Velious.
