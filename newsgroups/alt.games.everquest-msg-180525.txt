Congratulations. There are many pickup groups where this is not the case.
Particularly so in the Planes, where if you're unlucky the *total* loot
dropped over an hour or two may not cover reagent costs. (I'm talking yard
trash here, obviously, but at level 54 where I am at the moment yard trash
is where I'm at.)

In perhaps half the pickup groups I'm in there is *no* compensation for
reagents for the cleric. None. I'm expected to soak up the loss myself.
I'm willing to do this if I'm covering costs with loot, but that is by no
means universally the case.

I'll admit there are some groups where I get a bit more than my fair share;
mainly when the loot is as skewed as in the Planes (i.e. a couple of
diamonds
and piles of trash) but such groups are a minority.

I'm guessing that Scott's in the same situation that I am - mostly doing
pickup groups. (In my case, my guild is mostly in different time zones...)

I always Symbol the chanter; don't know if they're Runing at all, but from
what I've seen (chanter's HP start dropping as soon as the MOB beats on
them,
pretty much all the time) most chanters don't Rune in a group.

The main area where I see non-clerics get screwed is with KEI; a CHing
cleric
can frequently get by without it but druids and wizards seem to see it as a
requirement.

He probably doen't have the 50K plat to spare to learn to be a GM smith.
Certainly I don't. Current bank balance is a hair under 2K, mostly earned
from the shopping quest and some astute vendor mining. Very little of it
earned from exp grouping, which costs cash as often as earning it.

If you're overflowing with cash, I'm sure you can find some willing people
to accept a donation. Money is simply *not* that easy to come by for
everyone. And especially not for a cleric, where soloing MOBs is certainly
possible but not, generally speaking, fast, and exp grouping can frequently
cost cash.

If you know of a way for a skint cleric to make money in a hurry - I'm all
ears. Currently I'm running the shopping quest repeatedly, which earns about
100 plat and one blue an hour. Slow but safe... and boring as all heck.
