They don't have to - it started that way .............

Although here's one for you -

With the release of LDoN you can turn an orb of mastery
in to an NPC and get an Ornate Orb of Mastery with an
augment slot.

Just prior to the release of LDoN they changed the way
pet focus effects work so that you could have more than 2
for each type of pet.

Pet focus effects are based on two things now - level and
resist.  All the pet summons had a resist added to them
(fire for fire pets etc.) 

They added a spell to the SPDat for the epic pet - it was
a level 55 spell.  This spell does not exist in game, this
was done solely for the new focus items.

With the release of LDoN you had the opportunity to turn in
an Orb of Mastery to get an Ornate Orb of Mastery (with an
augment slot).  You still had to summon an orb of mastery and
equip it in the primary hand slot in order to summon an epic
pet.

In Takish there is an augment, Diamond Prism of Companionship
which works on pets 59 and up, no resist.  Obviously this does
not focus the epic pet, a level 55 (at the time) spell.

Mages bitched (naturally)

Some mages went ahead and PUT THE DPOC IN THEIR ORNATE ORB!

Remember, you need to equip a regular orb to summon an epic pet,
unequiping the ornate orb in the process.

Sony recently (2 patches ago) changed the level of manifest elements
to 59 - making the epic focusable by the DPoC.

Of course, if you were STUPID enough to put yours in the ornate orb,
you're SoL - they will not reimburse you for it.  

Personally, I don't blame 'em.
