Just pick a suitable place to have it.  I've seen several times that people
have their weddings in CB , LOIO, or Oasis, then get mad because people
won't be quiet or quit shouting, etc, while they have the wedding.  Just be
considerate (and save yourself the trouble), and don't pick some
overpopulated area and try to have the ceremony.

Just my 2cp.
