A "named spectre" in Oasis?  You're quite sure of this? Are you sure it wasn't
somebody's pet? (In which case I don't think it would drop anything, but it
would certainly con indifferent.)  Not saying there isn't one, but I've
certainly never heard of a named spec there, or anywhere, and the low level and
indifferent con lead me to suspect it was a pet.
