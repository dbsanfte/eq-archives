Apparently your definition of "safely" differs dramatically from
common usage.

Obviously, by your own example, these spots really are not safe, and
you are aware of this even as you pretend otherwise and try to shift
the blame.

Parking your character at a spawn does not automatically give you
ownership of the spawn. You have to actively engage the MOB, or it
belongs to whomever wants it. And I submit to you that when you're all
cozy in your bed for several hours, you are not actively engaging the
MOB.

Bull. You want a static, predictable game, go play PacMan. Everquest
is a multi-player game in which *nothing* is guaranteed, and the other
players are able to affect the dynamics of a zone.

Anyone who thinks they can go AFK while in a dungeon, for any amount
of time or for any reason, and be safe is a fool. Anyone who thinks
they can do so for hours while they sleep is a complete blithering
idiot. Anyone who does it anyway, and tries to blame other people for
it when inevitably something goes wrong, is a jackass.


I go AFK all the time, but I do so knowing the risks. And on those
occasions when something goes wrong, I know that is the chance I
accepted when I walked away from the machine.
