Everyones mentioned already the disconnects they get in the bazaar etc so
most of this is nothing new, except maybe the frequency of it.

I have been selling gear for a friend on EQ. I have a couple of Mules to do
this with (and I need them, he has a lot crap to sell) both are Bards on
seperate accounts. During this exchange, I won't bore you with the timing
just to say the characters were active at the time of these disconnects, as
we were exchanging items, moving about and chatting.

His Characters suffered 3 disconnects and one crash to desktop.
Mule_1 (The one I used for the least amount of transfers due to being full)
suffered no (personal) Disconnects or Crashes.
Mule_2 Suffererd, 3 Disconnects and 2 Crashes to Desktop and 1, get this,
return to Bind Point (which incidently was RV)
On top of this The Zone itself went down 3 times.

What should have taken 20mins took 90mins. It started off as midly annoying,
then got very annoying and was finally just funny. The highlights were my
Mules return to bindpoint only being able to move (now out of the
ecumberance free bazaar) using Selo's and our vain attempt to leave the
Bazaar only to have it crash a 3rd time on us as soon as we turned to head
for the exit.
