Ok, the reason why I even posted this instead of relying solely on
the numerous other "best duo" posts was the race question.  I have
a friend that is considering playing Eq on a very limited basis and
I want to start a support character that I can play when he is on.
I don't want to have us on differing factions (good/evil) or have 
to travel a long ways to meet at lvl 1.

So I guess I can deduce that for this purpose a good war/sha combo
would be Ogre/Troll.  Given that the recommendation is monk/sha though,
would a pair of Iksars be a wiser choice? (the xp penalty doesn't
really matter to me)

TIA
