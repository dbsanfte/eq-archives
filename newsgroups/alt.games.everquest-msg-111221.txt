First off, this is not a good zone for kiting.   Way too many adds and even
the greenies aggro most of the time (cats especially).

That said, this zone is great for harvesting cat pelts.  I'd stick with the
leopards.  Easy kills and usually multiple pelts per drop (mq and lq
mostly).  They move very fast even when snared.  If you go a little beyond
the zone entrance, you will find plenty of leopards.

Pathing in the zone is pretty static.  Once you see the pattern, you will be
able to find a decent med spot.

My druid fear-kited cats in this zone for a while but had to keep very alert
for adds.
