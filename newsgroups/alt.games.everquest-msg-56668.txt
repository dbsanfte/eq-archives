Generally, because they don't have this problem often enough
to live with the expense and/or aggravation fixing it would
cause.   Simply put, all they have to do is bring down the test
server a day or so before the patch, remove the server software,
and reinstall it.   Get that version certified, then move that build
to the production servers.   If there are problems in the certification
process, rinse and repeat until they're resolved.

In theory, they can control the server build without doing that.  In
practice, it works more often than not, so it's not worth fixing the
occasional fubar.   Their bottom line isn't going to be affected, at
least not in any substantial degree.   How many people are going
to cancel their accounts because the patch ran five (or more) hours
longer than expected?   Not many, if any.
