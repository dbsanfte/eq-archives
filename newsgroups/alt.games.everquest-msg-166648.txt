Sounds like a Migraine, I suffer from them too. The detached feeling,
vertigo, and the localized pain are all similar to mine. The game at
home makes it worse, probabaly 'cause of the lighting. You may be
playing in a dark room. The bright monitor just excites your head,
raises blood pressure etc etc.

When I get a full blown cluster migraine, I have to go in a dark room
and just sit.

There are two things you should do, find the trigger for the migraine.
You will always have them, for me it is Nutrasweet and chocolate. To a
lesser degree MSG will do it too. Yours could be red wine, hard
cheese, certain nuts, fruits. You have to see. I am sorry to say, but
I had to experiment. You will have to as well. Avoid the trigger food.

The second thing is to reduce the frequency. I lost 30lbs (12kg) and
that helped. Stress is a big indicator of high frequency for me. Blood
pressure increases frequency.

When you get them, your doctor may prescribe some sedative to relax
you. Americans prefer pills to cure their ills. I don't mind some, but
I just stick it out. If it gets bad, I will take the pill. My strategy
is a strong coffee, dark room, and perhaps a shower.
