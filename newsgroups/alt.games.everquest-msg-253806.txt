Heh yes i see them everywhere but just becauses your paranoid does not mean
that everyone is not out to get you :) I think socialism and tyranny is the
natural state of man, I consider capitalism a historical abherration, it of
course works every time it is tried while socialism fails everytime but hey
for most people history started this morning. I expect half of people to
cling as hard as they absolutely can to their belief in socialism. I think
it makes people feel all warm and fuzzy and makes them feel like good people
. I think it makes them feel better about themsleves if they have failed to
achieve in life, hey its not my fault that other guy must have cheated or
stole his way to riches, it cant just be hard work or I would be rich. I
expect people to refer to the science of economics as a religion.

What makes you think that I have not visited europe? Maybe more europeans
should visit us :) Our quality of life is a bit better then theirs and it
shows in the accomodations we live in. Reminds me of a russian I met 25
years ago. When being shown around the area near our college he said dont
just show me the best areas of your city. No one had the heart to tell him
that college areas are certainly not the high rent district :)
