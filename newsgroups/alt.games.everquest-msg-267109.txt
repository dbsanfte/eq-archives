Anyone have any experience with this mob? According to The Runes
enchanter site its a two group (one if you are good) kill. It seems
you clear the sentries, then you can target it. Sounds simple. So the
question is, are there any surprizes. We went with our main warrior to
do the big Girplan (Devourer) and he was suppossed to be a 2-3 group
fight. We had 5 groups wipe due to his knockback. First the main tank
would get knocked back and lose agro, then clerics and others would
get knocked around the zone and agro other things. I'm sure we will
figure out how to position so the knock backs are not so drastic, and
we will beat that mob.

I'm trying to avoid a problem with this enchanter epic mob as getting
the help is going to be difficult enough with many people going to EQ2
and a lot of people too interested in sitting in WOS than doing epic
1.5 stuff. Any tips would be appreciated. Server terris Thule if it
matters.

Ken
