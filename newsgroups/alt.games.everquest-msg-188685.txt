The Guards around Kelethin will not attack an Arborean.  I've been medding,
sitting or the orc platform, and been attacked by an Arborean.  I've then
stood toe to toe and killed the Arborean while the guards stood placidly by
and watched.  Arboreans don't like me.  I don't like Arboreans.  Guards
don't care who wins.

Cheers,
Eric
