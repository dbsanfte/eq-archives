You forgetting the first time you wiped at the bottom of befallen?  Or
the first time you wiped way down in BB?  They were very challenging
recoveries to appropriate leveled people.

Actually, I saw that as just one of the challenges of EQ - it was the
experience loss in the early game that burned me as a bard. 

Later, with the exp loss cut in half and on my mage, deaths at lower
levels were trivial.

I take a lot of risks in WoW - but, then, we took some serious risks in
EQ too.  Just our style of play.

I have to take exception to "A LOT" too - 

In WoW a death inflicts a 10% durability loss on your equipped gear.
Repair costs are proportional to the I-Level(*) of the gear - the
better the gear, the higher the costs to repair.
Rezzing at the spirit healer inflicts an extra 25% durability loss to
everything on you (including gear in your bag) and a 10 minute (at max
level) rez sickness that makes you pretty much incapable of fighting.

With my current mix of blues and a few greens(**) a full repair is
something on the order of 3-4gold (20min of dedicated farming, 30-40
min of doing other things that incidentally generate income).

In TBC at 61 with much higher I-Level gear (part of narrowing the
equipment gap between people like me and high-level raiders is a whole
mess of introductory quest gear in the first zone of the expansion 
that puts me on par with the base raiding level of the old world) I
see a 5-6 gold per full repair.  Naxx geared folks see 10+ gold for
a full repair. 

Also, a lot of raiders carry extra sets of armor (for different jobs:
warrior dps/tank sets, paladin tank/healing sets, feral druid
heal/dps/tank sets, and different resist gear) - so a spirit rez can
become very expensive to them - but instances don't leave your body
by the mobs that killed you - you rez at the zoneline as you enter.

So, you see, a spirit healer rez costs me 10 minutes of rez sickness and
about 1 gold.  For a top-end raider it's 10 minutes and 2-3 gold.

(*) I-Level is the formula by which the devs assign stats to gear - in the
old world is was equal to the required level of the armor for green items,
up to 15 higher than the required level for blue, and up to 30+ higher
for purple and orange.

In TBC level 58-60 greens have ilvls near old world low-purple range and
the there are no really high purples (yet) as those came about through
adding raids and having to boost ilvls without boosting required level.

(**)
Green - fairly common world drop gear, easy quest gear.  The typical
leveling gear of most players in most slots
Blue - Rare world drop gear, hard quests (usually with elite or dungeons
in them), drops of instance bosses.
Purple - Very rare world drop, very few quests have them as rewards, drop
off very hard instance bosses and raid bosses.
Orange - Legendary, the only way to get them is multi-part quests
involving raid bosses.
 
All that said - here's the key question:

"How hard to you fight to live through a hairy situation?"  If you
desperately employ every trick in the book and are in a sweat at the
end of the fight (win or lose) then the death penalty is high enough.

Heck, I get in a sweat trying to keep Snowclaw alive and myself alive
using every trick in the book - traps, kiting, feigning, mana-pots, so
the penalty is high enough for me.

If people take risks and aren't afraid of trying new things, then it's
not too high.

I thought that a lot of folks in EQ were too risk averse - hence the
"We need a cleric", "We can't do that without an enchanter" type mentality
that was so common.  

We would do a lot with non-standard groups (mage, ranger, druid for a lot
of the way to 60) - so EQ's penalty wasn't too stiff for us.

In WoW it's less common (though still there - a lot of folks won't run a
tough instance with just a druid as healer because they don't have a
general rez - just a combat rez on a 30min cooldown).  Getting groups who
will go after a tough boss with just a hunter pet as a tank is more 
common than groups who would accept non-standard setups in EQ.  (I still
don't understand why summoned pets in EQ were hit with the same "can't
hold aggro if a PC is in melee range" fix that was intended for charmed
pets tanking Vindi).
