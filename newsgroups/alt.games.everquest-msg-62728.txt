    The server may have your character "state" in some sort of temporary
file, which is saved as a permanent record from time to time. Single
anecdote that supports this: recently a friend's cleric was in Upper Spiders
in Velk's. A weenie in the group ninja looted a Silver Chitin Bracer (or
whatever that AC 15 STR 7 DEX 7 HP 40 thing is called) and /q'ed
immediately. They petitioned. Later that day, weenie comes back while the
group is still in US and a GM was there ASAP. The GM verified that the
weenie had hit /q so fast that the server never knew he had the bracer, and
it had poofed. So the GM created another, and had everyone present roll.
Now, had there been a file on your computer with inventory info, I'd THINK
that the bracer couldn't have poofed.
