    No, it was something like a druid or a wizard (non-MB). I think it
involved aggro kiting, which doesn't make sense to me (Wuoshi is fast? He
summons?) but he did it. Sephrok was the BotB winner on Quellious, and made
it quite far in the server-wide competition given he was only level 59 at
the time. He's far and away the best ranger on the server, and he's not in
any of the big guilds so that speaks to his skill at the class.
