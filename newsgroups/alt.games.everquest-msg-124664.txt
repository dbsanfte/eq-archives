I wouldn't particularly class myself as uber, but come on look at this
stuff.

Remember this is *rare* loot, from *rare* mobs.. and they drop junk like
this (yes some of the items are nice, but look at the mass majority) - I
haven't even seen half of these mobs alive on all my trips to HS.

HS isn't an easy zone to get in and out of (keyed, locked doors) but the
loot isn't a shade on most comparable zones.

It is a really fun zone for me (I do wear an item from there actually,
fingerbone hoop) but for the majority, you would struggle even selling it
