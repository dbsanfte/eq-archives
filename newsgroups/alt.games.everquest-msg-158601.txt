 As others mentioned, most zone in spots are safe. 

 Disease sees a lot of trains on my server, so probably not a good place
to AFK. 

 Nightmare is a nightmare. Usually you'll have some idiot quad kiting
mobs and training them through the graveyard. Also another spot not to
AFK.

 Justice is about 99% safe. I've never seen a mob up there but people re
creative.

 Valor... Well you need to pass the trials to get there and you wont be
doing that at 55 solo. Graveyard is fairly safe though, sometimes some
skeletons are trained to the zone out, but there are many safe places
since most of the mobs in the bottom half are not kos.

 Storms... Same as Valor in that you have to pass the trials. Mobs that
hit for 1k and nuke for 2k though so definitely not a friendly place.

 I'd recommend somewhere not in PoP. Now that most 61+ people have moved
out of the old world zones you should be able to find something. Trying
to solo in PoP will probably get you killed.
