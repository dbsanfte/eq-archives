From the shadows, the mysterious "Reo" <nobody@nowhere.com> (if that
IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

Without AM2 at least you are screwing your groups and raid groups over
doing this (and if soloing taking far longer to kill the mob than
necessary), and without Endless Quiver there's no point any ranger
taking this advice at all.

Since the OP obviously wasn't packing 30 some AA and wasn't L59+, he
should definately not follow your advice, nor should any other ranger
without them. No offense.
