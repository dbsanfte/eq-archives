Good luck on that.  Someday, I am hoping to get some kind of broadband
access, it's not like I live out in the boons or anything, just the wonders
of dealing with the load baby bell.  At least I only pay a fixed fee for my
crappy 26.4k dial up connection.  And, yes, I do have a 56k modem, just not
quite sure why.
