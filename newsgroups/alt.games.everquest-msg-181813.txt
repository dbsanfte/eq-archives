Hello,

I'm wanting to come back to the game after a 18 or so month break.  My
situation is that my occupation is very unpredictable and I am subject to
having to play odd hours and for varying degrees of time.  With this in mind
I know I will be playing a lot of time solo.  I had a blast leveling a Necro
to level 53 solo during my last tour and this time around would like to try
something different.  I'm thinking maybe a Monk or SK.  What I need to know
is the viability of these classes in a [mostly] solo career.  Would also
like any advice on other possible soloing classes (I know what used to be
good at soloing but due to the time I have been away I'm not sure If any
changes have been made to the classes to make them more / less solo-able.  I
do not have PoP but will be getting it this weekend if that makes a
difference.   Thanks in advance.

P.S. I know that the "What class?" question has been asked a lot and I
apologize....I just wanted an up to date account of possible solo classes.

Thanks
Jason
