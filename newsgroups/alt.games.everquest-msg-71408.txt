One small change that would significantly change the strategy of the
game, but also greatly enrich the end game for less essential classes
would be to change the maximum group number from 6 to 8. Nearly all
high-level camps require a tank-cleric-cc-evac while a fair number
(most of OS, all of HS, and a fair portion of STemple) require a rogue
as well, leaving a paltry one or two slots for "other," which all the
other classes must compete over.

Strategy would change, certainly, but not in a bad way.
