In a pickup group, generally no.   90% of the time, it will start a "Don't
tell me how to play my class you ignorant warrior" rant.    9 of the other 10%
of the time, it results in the Shaman leaving in a huff.

As for what shaman buffs I like...   SoW is a necessity if a person there can
cast it.   This is the one most likely to save your group.

For other buffs,  it's pretty situational.  Armor class is always good.    If
we are fighting hard mobs, or have a complete healing cleric in the group,
then the Talisman of Altuna?  (Tuna) line of hit point buffs is good.   If I'm
low on carrying capacity, or the shaman has extra mana, I'll request strength.
Dexterity on people with weapons that proc and warriors. (I believe critical
hits are treated as a proc... not certain).    Other than that, Dex is wasted.

Oh, and once you get a haste buff, (attack speed) you're my best friend if
you're buffing with that. ;)  .
