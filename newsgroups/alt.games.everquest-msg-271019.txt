A software-mirrored array will typically allow you to recover your data in the event of a
drive crash.  But you may find it quite difficult to swap a new disk into the array.  It
may be more efficient to grab the data with a WinPE boot process, and then completely
re-roll the array.

With software mirroring, there is a performance impact to your system resources.  Whether
it's enough of an impact to interfere with your productivity, is solely a subjective
opinion.  I would probably not choose to run EQL with cached textures on a
software-mirrored array.  I like my zone times to be nice and spiffy ;->

I have heard folks refer to the IDE RAID controllers from Promise and HighPoint
Technologies as "software" RAID controllers, but I never delved into it any further.  If
they are indeed offloading some of their processing, then system resources are being
affected.  Regardless, I use products from both manufacturers.

My gaming system has a motherboard-down HPT372 controller, driving a striped pair of 8MB
7200RPM disks.  Disk throughput seems very acceptable to me.

My Dell PE 400SC Windows Servers have FastTrak100TX2s connected to mirrored pairs of
similar disks.  I have Celeron processors; a buddy of mine (with the same drive
configuration) has P4 processors.  I'm not saying that my performance is piss-poor, not by
any means, but his servers certainly run circles around mine.  Because the P4 outperforms
the Celeron (in this generation of CPUs), this seems to be a good indication that the
drive controllers are offloading some or all of their tasks.
