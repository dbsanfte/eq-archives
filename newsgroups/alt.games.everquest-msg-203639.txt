My barbarian beastlord is in love with Megan O'Reilly in Everfrost. Always
give her the Braveheart "I love y'...always have, always will." I always
speak to NPCs as "people" for the sake of staying in character. My friends
(RPers) do it too and it adds to the group's enjoyment.

I also use languages for RPing. When in EF, I (and some online friends) only
speak barbarian. My troll SK only speaks troll or dark speech. We have a lot
of fun with it.

Like any paper & pencil game, RPing on EQ lies in the creativity of the
players, not the game.
