Certain weapons will proc much more often than others.  It is one of the
things that is built in to each weapon.

I used Bloodfire for a few levels, and a Club of the Ice Ocean for many more.
Despite the longer delay on the club and using it in the off hand, it proc'ed
much more frequently than Bloodfire.  (or so it seemed, I did not log it.)   2
to 3 club nukes per fight was not uncommon, while I considered myself lucky if
I got a proc at all from the sword.

I still miss that club.... used it from 51 to 58 or 59....  was an old friend
by the time I finally upgraded it.
