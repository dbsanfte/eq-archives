The same could hold true for any form of contract. If a car dealer had
"you must sacrifice your firstborn child to me" in the sale contract
and you went and signed it, he couldn't enforce that term legally.

The question is, is the EULA any less enforceable than any other form
of consumer contract? I say no, and I don't see any logic in any
argument I've heard to the contrary...
