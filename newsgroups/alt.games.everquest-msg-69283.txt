Put a mark by name on this one...lost about 400pp of stuff in a bag
that dropped when I was twinking a friend.  The friend forgot to make
space in his inventory for the trade, it hit the ground and a merchant
got it.  Sucky thing is, you can't even kill the merchant to get it
back.  Oh well, it was our fault, and we both chalked it up to bad
Karma for the twinking....
