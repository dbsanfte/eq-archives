Water is consumed much faster in NRo and Oasis than normal.  That I've
observed far too often to even be bothered by your ignorant jab.  I
suspect SRo also consumes water faster, but I've never spent more than
a few minutes at a time there, so I can't say for sure.  But most of my
characters have started in Freeport.  Most of them have moved into NRo
early in their careers, eating and drinking the same food/drink.  Every
single one of them has had their water (or milk) consumed about 50%
faster in those particular desert zones.

I hit the hotkeys to forcefeed about 10 times for every time I actually
consume anything.  I always have food and drink in top level inventory
slots, I hit both keys in rapid succession.  Try another theory.

Your ignorance does not equate to accuracy.  Take a character with
10 stacks of regular food and drink stand in the bazaar, without
being overweight for a day or two, note how much of each is consumed.
Then restock food and drink and make the character way overweight
(like 800+ weight) and once again wait a day or two (an RL day or
two mind you) and check consumption.  Then get back to me.
