>You failed.. Try alt.test.PigFucker

I understand that any post marked "test", is indeed a "test" of someones
newsreader.  So usually I don't even look at these posts.  I just mark them
"read".
(I didn't know about alt.test either).
Vector, sorry this guy was so rude your first time on.  Keep in mind there are
a few idiots in the game, too.  I have a cure for them: /ignore "idiot"  - fill
in the quotes with the idiots actual name.
