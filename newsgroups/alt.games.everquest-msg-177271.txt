DLM - I posted this message on the VN boards under the E`ci server board,
and ran into about 3 other people with the same views that it was basically
my fault.

Here's what I explained to them...

I gave him the password for only two reasons:
1) I needed to get my toon out of dangers way because I'm sure it would be
days before I could plan something with either my guild or another guild to
pick me up - out of Ssra (im not in a kiddie guild)

2) I needed to get a group of people in the guild out as well.  There were 3
groups, 2 druids (one was woodknight) and a wizard, with not too many able
to gate.

Well that should explain it, I thought I could have trusted this guy, who
now plays DAoC, and he betrayed me...
Hopefully I will be able to convey this message of "Never trust anyone, even
your mother" to the EQ community.
