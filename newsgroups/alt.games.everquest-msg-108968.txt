You get used to it I guess....

I remember my first *real* camp... the AC in OOT for 26 hours straight (and
no gd pop!!)  I had work the next day too.. when I logged off the comp about
8.30am the next morning, I felt physically sick, skipped work, and slept
pretty much the whole day.

I guess I got used to it, on my first ever PoH raid we went all the way up
to Inny (boo didn't get to fight him).. which meant going to bed 6.30am,
waking up at 8am

When I think of godforsaken Chardok Royals...  I'd get home from work 5pm or
so, the raid would start about 10-11pm my time, and I'd end up getting to
bed about 9am the next day (it was a Friday night)

A few times now I've done an all-nighter and still gone to work... 1 that
comes to mind now is when my guild first attempted Tormax (we'd killed Vindi
and Statue previously that night) I got dressed and cooked breakfast
in-between pulls.. and when I finally camped out, I was on my way to work 5
mins later

And no... it really isnt healthy for you.
