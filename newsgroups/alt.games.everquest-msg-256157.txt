I think a druid might be easier to play than a mage, and druids also
get some very useful spells like SOW and ports (though mages being
able summon all kinds of things is also very handy).  Plus mages, like
other INT casters have to research some of their spells; in fact, some
spells are research-only (not sold by NPC spell vendors) so you would
either have to get the components to make the spell yourself (or ask a
higher level mage to make the spell for you) or try to find it in the
Bazaar.

But if you're looking for a class that is not played by tons of
people, druid is not it!
