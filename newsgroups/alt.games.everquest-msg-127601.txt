Well, in the circles I hang out in, none of the rogues have any AA abilities
yet, a few pullers have Run 1, maybe 2.  Some of us are not quite up to that
level yet.  I agree that a rogue is not necessarilly dead when said rogue
tanks, but the rogue is far less effective than a more suitable character,
barring some serious equipment which is well beyond the reach of any rogues
that I play with.  Having played the main healer in groups at times, I
flinch whenever the rogue gets the aggro for any length of time because it
will mean downtime after the fight.
