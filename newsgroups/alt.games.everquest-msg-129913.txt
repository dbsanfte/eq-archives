"Whatta you mean? It's a high-level mob, right?
Don't you just send in the 60 warrior who activates
Defensive and tanks for 10-15 seconds or so while
a CH rotation keeps him alive, then everybody joins
in?  That's all any of the high level game is, right?"

;-)





On a side note...we had a guildee wizard manaburn
Dain the other night when he was at 10%...

The nuke "critical'd" for 452 damage.  From a full
bar of mana.  We bug'd it, but in all fairness we were
laughing too hard to really get upset.  The wizard
himself was threatening to head back to Orc1 in EC
and show those newbs a thing or two...
