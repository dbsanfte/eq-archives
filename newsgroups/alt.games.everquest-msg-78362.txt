I learnt fletching when you got one arrow per combine, no way to buy a
stack of components without click-drag, no way of putting a single component
in without click drag, and the ability to combine the wrong components
when you, after having your mind numbed, put two shafts, 1 arrow head and
one fletch in. ;-)

Imagine, if you will, with that effort *per arrow* how long filling a
quivver took.

Bwa. Ha. Ha. Ha. Heee.

It was horrible.
