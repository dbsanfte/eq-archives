I found Iceburg (the polar bear) and was unable to find out if he is the
same as this "Karg Iceburg" used in the polar bear cloak quest.
http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=712
I /shout a few times but everybody only understood that "iceburg" was
around, not who or what anybody was talking about.  Everyone appeared in
total chaos as no one would answer anyones questions, only ask the same
questions over and over and nobody got any help.  Does anybody know who this
iceburg needed in the above quest is?  And if it is the polar bear guy, I
hailed him and he only growls (he conns amiable to me, but being a bear I
wouldn't expect him to talk to me), what do I do? Just give items?
