   I think that if I had any say in it, I might go with the "unlocking a
portal" by traveling to it first by conventional means idea.  It would
still give true newbies a chance to first hand experience the vastness of
the world, still have the exciting "My first trip through the Karanas" type
stories, without veterans having to wait 20 minutes for the boat for 400th
time, or begging druids or wizards for ports.

   I don't, and I don't think that has much to do with the travel issue at
all.  In the four years that I have played Everquest, there have always
been zones that are vastly under populated compared to other zones.  People
flock to where either the experience or loot (or preferably both) is
considered to be better than other zones for the effort needed to get it. 
It doesn't matter if they can get there in 5 seconds using a book, or 50
minutes using a boat and cross country run.   

   In my perfect MMORPG, all mobs would give pretty much the same
experience/loot for their appropriate level no matter what zone they
happened to be in.  You want to be in a more crowded zone?  Hunt one that
is easier to get to.  You want to have some breathing room?  Then go to a
zone that you have to run for a bit to get to.  You want an Uber Dodad of 
Shining Beauty?  Start killing level appropriate mobs in any zone, hope one
drops, or that you get an equivalent drop that you can trade for it.

   This is why think there are so many abandoned zones.  Why hunt in South
Karana when you know you can get 3x's the experience or more in same amount
of time spent in Paladral Caverns?
