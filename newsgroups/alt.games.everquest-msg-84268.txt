That actually never would have occured to me.  I thought that
under play nice if a group wanted to run in and kill Naggy while
you were buffing after clearing fire giants, they could.

Not that it ever happens, simply because that's so incredibly
wrong and rude in EQ that those offenders would never get
a group or make a deal again.  But it's not against the
"rules," AFAIK.

Again, it should be, but it wouldn't have occured to me in that
context.
