Just from the head:
Solo:
pet does 50% damage or more: it takes 50% of the exp
pet does less then 50% damage: it takes no exp

Group:
pet does 50% damage or more: it takes 50% of the exp
pet does less then 50% damage: it takes 1% of the exp

I'm pretty sure it was like this a year ago. Never looked back at it. Simply
nuke the mob to smithereens and you're safe.
Note that in some groups (duo with a druid ie) pets can actually do 50% or
more damage if you let it. Make sure you together with your groupies do
more.
