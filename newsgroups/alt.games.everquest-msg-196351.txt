Um, maybe the Rogue stuff is different, but I can't recall any of
the Kunark armor differing in appearance from the standard for the
race wearing it (aside from color, of course).  So, if you're a DE
and you wear a hat with a plate graphic, I can't see how you could
avoid that cheesy-variation-on-a-kiddie-cartoon-skeleton-mask look.

But the AC is still nice.  :)
