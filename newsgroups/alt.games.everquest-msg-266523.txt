    Even if you're in a race, ultra high playtime isn't as important as time 
well spent. Our main competition has higher playtime than we do, but while 
they spin their wheels doing old content and failing new content because 
they didn't bother to level up, we levelled up first, then went after the 
new content. If everyone is smart then you need to outplaytime them, but 
truthfully, not everyone is that smart, even at the top end.

    For comparison, my guild is at 752, 1052, 791, 530, 461, 702, 353, 227, 
233, 234, 160, 313. Four people who play EQ full-time, two with heavy 
playtime but jobs outside the home as well, and six people with normal 
playtime. None of us understand how Mr. 1052 does it, or how he's second in 
AA's to our top BST (Felpaw, 1115 AA's and first BST to 70 on any server).

    A good percentage of our 100% players were always like this - they'd AA 
until they had the key AA's, then log as soon as raiding was done. No need 
to quest for nifty items when you're already at the top of the loot food 
chain.

    Our numbers match these very closely. I think we were ahead of you on 
Uqua and Zun, behind on Inktu'ta and Anguish. So our experiences are very 
comparable, and they're remarkably similar. It's somewhat surprising - given 
the much larger number of players in the end game on Quellious compared to 
on Venril Sathir (when VS had two Qvic guilds with a third almost there we 
had two Qvic guilds, a Qvic guild alliance, an Australian Qvic guild, and 
one more guild almost there) you'd think that the "true hardcore players" 
would gravitate to the topmost guilds. But players tend to stay with their 
friends.
