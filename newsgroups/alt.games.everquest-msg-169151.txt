However, if you are a shaman, and you should somehow accidentally root
yourself in front of a pair of blue Raging Drolvargs, and, you should happen
not to have gate memorized at the time (quite possibly, even if you do), it
is quite lethal.  I might add that even having a ranger with you does not
help much, as by the time the ranger can attempt to get aggro off you, you
get low health aggro.  In defense of the ranger, she did manage to heal me
from unconsciosnous once, using her amazing 90pt heal.
