When you whined Sony must not want your money for not doing things the
way you want them done.

That is too damn bad.

Are you capable of anything original? Or does your brain only go so
far as to mimic what I say back at me?

Once again, Howard demonstrates his utter ability to comprehend
English. The problem was established to be that she couldn't play her
characters, not that she couldn't transfer them. The fact she couldn't
transfer them was YOUR whining about a solution that wouldn't have
been necessary if people could have followed the rules.

Understand it yet, or do I need to post it in Spanish, of Finnish, or
something?

No, it wouldn't, if you would actually read what I said, and quit
repeating your tired defeated line that came *after* the actual
problem.

If you aren't willing to listen, you will never learn, kid.

Already done. You whined that they weren't doing things the way you
wanted when it was in no way Sony's fault for the problem.

Sticking your fingers in your ears doesn't make it go away, kid.
