Hang on to your amazement Ed.  That way, by the simple expedient of
changing one letter you arrange for the comprehensionally challenged
to provide you with amusement.  Cultivating an air of detachment
helps, as does having a friend in the group you can swap incredulous
tells with (careful about mistells tho, heh).  If the group turns
out to be a total loss, help with the CR and then offer them a ride
out before looking for intelligent life elsewhere (even nitwits are
capable of spreading a good rep, perhaps only by accident, but...).
