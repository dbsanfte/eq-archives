"Well, the time has finally come! We are about to enter our first stage 
of Beta!

Beta 0 (also commonly known as Friends & Family Beta) is about to begin. 
This first phase is comprised of a very small group of players that are 
selected from among people we know personally and know very well.

As we progress into other phases of Beta and are ready to start 
selecting participants from among our community members, we will let you 
know right here in this forum. When we are ready to move into each phase 
and begin taking applications, you will hear it here first!"

Regards,
Kul
