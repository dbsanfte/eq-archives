Despite all the hunting mobs to get money, there are lots of guides people
have written.  Some you can even find for free.  They usually all say the
basic same thing.  Some the really bad ones will tell you to start smithing
(how to do it of course) and make toolboxes.  Of course that was nerfed a
long time ago.  Anyhow, you could if you had nothing better to do become a
master fletcher and make decent money, or you could also do baking.  Like I
said it's boring as crap but it's very possible...  One of the free guides I
read (i was bored at work) explained every single detail in how to make
100pp an hour in baking...start with so much money, buy such and such from
this vendor at this location, etc etc....  However, if you want to make lots
of money just keep fighting and leveling.  I don't think there are too many
people out there at levels lower then 50 that go "hmm you look like you have
crap armor and weapons, I am not inviting you in my group"  Not having a
character +50 then i don't know if that changes but I would think that if
you kept fighting and looting along the way you could get some nice armor...
