Elsewhere in The American Spectator, Ben admitted that he knew the game
wasn't at fault, but felt frustrated just the same.  Let's face it, this
game -is- addicitve.  I imagine everyone here went through a phase where
they ate, slept, and breathed EQ.  For many, that phase passes, but it still
seems a helluva lot like addiction.  Why else would anyone put up with the
KSing, lamers, griefers, constant nerfs, twelve-week-camps, and all the
other frustrationg aspects of EQ?  It's because it's all worth it when you
hit that major milestone (like being able to use the right-click effects on
your DW helm) or when your guild comes together to accomplish something.
You're searching for that next high.
