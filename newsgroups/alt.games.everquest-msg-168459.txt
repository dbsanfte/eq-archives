It is completely clear what we need to do to get on the rotation.  We need
to go in and kill VS or Trak, preferably with the agreement of the guild
that is currently up on the rotation, in which case, they just get bumped
out to the next spawn, and we get on the rotation.  The issue is that only
guilds are allowed on the rotation, not an alliance of several guilds.  It
makes no difference how often we raid together, how long we have done so,
there is only one accepted exception to this, and that is an alliance of
Japanese guilds.

What we need to do is decide if we are going to allow that to stand as is,
or go in regardless, and possibly cause issues with a fair number of the
larger guilds on EMarr.

We will discuss it with some of the guilds in the rotation, and, decide what
to do after that.
