Why would Monks want a thing like that?  It'd wreck the movie!  I mean,
how many tickets would you sell if you ended the car chases by taking
out the opposition with a rocket launcher at the start?  Monks were
meant to go flying thru the horde of spear-catchers like semi-sentient
cyclones, pausing for a brief close-up every once in a while when they
take out some poor schmuck with a particularly stylish move.  Sheesh!
some people just don't know it when they have it good.
