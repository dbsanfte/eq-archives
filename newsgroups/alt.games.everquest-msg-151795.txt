Aha!  Another piece of the plot.  They mollycoddle all you whining
casters level after level thru the fifties, while my Paladin has
gotten both diddly and squat 51 thru 54.  Oh wait, I got a new disc
in there somewhere, Fearless, which is so incredibly powerful that
they had to limit its duration to 10 seconds (wtf use is a 10-second
immunity to fear?).  I think Sanjian must be right, it's all a plot
to drive the Paladin population to zero... hang in there Meem, your
Shaman will be getting Brell's eventually.


Kaev <--- too stubborn (or is that stupid?) to give up as a Paladin
[Yes, I know, they moved DA from 55 to 51, but there isn't another
spell 51 thru 54 that's worth the time it takes to scribe it.]
