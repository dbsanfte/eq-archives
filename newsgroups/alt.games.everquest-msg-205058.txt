For a magician, I think you have to be at least 46 to get some of the NPC's
to talk to you.  Even though you can get the spell to summon the orb at 46
(think it works that way instead of the epic piece being a permanent item),
you can't use the orb to summon the epic pet until 51.  Until then, the epic
Orb of Mastery is just an item with nice stats. That's what I've gathered
from reading.  I've run into a couple of epic mages but didn't grill them
about their experiences.
