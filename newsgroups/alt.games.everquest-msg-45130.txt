This sucks, I quit playing a few months ago and
gave away a full set of crafted armor.  Now I'm
starting to play again and I've got a butt ass
naked lvl 33 Ogre Warrior and an Executioners Axe.
I guess I know the routine "Go kill stuff, sell
it, buy more armor" but the thought it bores me.
Anyone know a good place where I could go camp for
cash?
