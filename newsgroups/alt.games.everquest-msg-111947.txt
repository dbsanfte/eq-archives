*Nods* Totally understandable. Just there are a large ammount of posts on
this news group and I dont really have time to sort through them all. (I
hope no one thought I was being sarcastic about my previous post, my ISP was
acting funny for a couple of weeks so I stopped track of posts)

Anyhow I hope to see you in EQ2
