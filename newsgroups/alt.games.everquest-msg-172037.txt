The reason you loose your buffs when near death and zone is that you have
+hp gear on and your hp are technically in the red. I.E. if you took of your
hp gear at this point you would die. You will notice that when you zone your
hp jumps up to where if you took off you hp gear you would have 1 hp. It is
a small bug in that you are technically dead when you zone, in that only
your hp gear is keeping you alive. When you zone you are set back to 1 hp
and all your buffs are stripped. You can test this by adding up all your hp
gear, then get beat on until you remaining hp is below this number then
zone. When you zone through look at your hp. It will be the total of your hp
gear plus 1. An other fun thing to do is finish a battle under your hp gear
number, sit to heal, and switch gear to int or wis gear to work on a trade
skill, passing the time while you heal. You have 50 hp, take off your pfvr
at +6ac +65 hp and wonder for a moment while you re-load WTF I died?
