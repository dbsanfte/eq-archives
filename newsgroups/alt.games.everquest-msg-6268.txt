First off most of the people that go around challenging other players are
looking for someone safe to kill. You wont see them challenging someone who
might kill them. I had just got done powerleveling my new Monk to level 10,
had Skin like Nature, full set of 51 shaman buffs and augmentation. Was just
about to do some trade skill work so I had on my Enchanters int gear when
this level 13 Warrior came up and challenged me to duel to the death. I told
him he canned red to me and he says so. Was he ever suppressed when I
accepted equipped my 2 Fighting Batons and kick his butt.
Now on to your Cleric first don't waste too much money on low level spells
you won't use later on try to look a little bit ahead go to a good website
like www.castersrealm.com and study what each spell does and determine which
you will need. After reaching say level 6 I would head to Befallen and start
working the first floor with a partner (Beffallen has an Exp Bonus). Work
Befallen till around 17 then head to Unrest. Clerics are always in big
demand in the Undead zones. If you can afford buy and carry with you the
next healing and shield spells in the lower levels. The Lower levels and
those to spells come in handy you can be in a good group when you level and
you don't want to leave to get new spells the older spell just don't seem to
work well anymore.
I know I am a bit long winded at time so good luck hope this helps
