As unpleasent as it sounds, magicians have 2 roles at high level.
1 is malosini (which shamans can cast anyway)
2 is mana production (mod rods)

Sure it frees up mages from mod rod duty now, mainly because they have no
other raid use or desire now.

If its a ffa raid where "every bit helps", sure they can do some damage,
transfer a miniscule amout of mana.. but high end raids with precision
planning, lag and numbers carefully added into the equation..  who would
realistically chose mages after this nerf?

Is this VI's ploy to piss people off so they move to EQ2 faster....
