Hm... The guy is perfectly right. The question one has to ask before any 
upgrade (including Linux upgrades, of course) is whether they *need* it, 
and whether the upgrade will allow them to do anything they can't do with 
their current set up. They don't need to look at XP or dis it to determine 
whether they need it or not. If their machine runs fine and does all they 
want, they definitely *don't* need it.

All things seem to indicate that the most persuasive reason to move to 
Windows XP is that Microsoft will proceed to break compatibility with older 
OSs pretty soon, rather than any practical reasons of a technical nature.
