You will find that you can spend that entire 20k on the Shammy very
quickly, especially when you get to where you need some expensive
spells.  (But that is pretty far down the road).

8.3% faster (you will swing 8.3% more often with a 31% haste item than
with a 21% haste item).  Haste rates, by convention, give you the
percentage of increase in your theoretical damage output.  A 21% haste
item will make you swing 1.21 times for every 1 time you would swing
without it.  A 31% haste item will make you swing 1.31 times. 
1.31/1.21 - 100% = 8.26% increase.

With that in mind, you will still probably just want a pair of SCHW or
something along those lines.

To put this in some perspective...If you were looking at the
difference between a 9/19 (a lammy for example) weapon and a 10/17
weapon (another common ratio on weapons), the 10/17 weapon with no
damage bonus is 24% more damaging.  Add a damage bonus in at later
levels and the faster weapon has an even greater advantage.  IOW, make
sure you get a reasonably nice weapon before you spend big on haste.

Neither have I but I would assume stamina (HP) and dexterity (procs,
weapon skills) are your best stats.  They are for a monk.  One other
stat you may consider is your wisdom.  Of all the hybrids, Beastlords
seem to be the ones that would benefit the most from a deeper mana
pool.
