I would say that using any sort of fear, to make the mob run
into the portal, is exploiting, but you can't control or
stop a mob from running its pathing, and so i would say you
aren't exploiting if you are pulling to an area, and when
the mob is low on health it paths odd.   I had a similar
situation come up a long time ago with Zarchoomi.  She ran
as if to zone into G'fay from Butcherblock, after chasing
her SoW'ed butt all over the zone, while my little dwarf had
none, i wasn't about to back off and wait for her to leave
the zone line.  I don't think its abuse unless you are
deliberately causing them to path there, as in the case of
using spook the dead or any other fear spell.
