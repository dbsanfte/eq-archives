Quite.

First, the main complaint is not wordless invites are rude.  The complaint is
that spam invites are rude.  If you invite me without a word, and I take the
time to click "reject group"... inviting me 6 more times in rapid succession
*is* rude.   I clicked on no because I didn't want to group with you.  Period.
Asking again 5 more times isn't going to do anything except piss me off.

That wordless invites are rude is a secondary and much lesser point.  If you
want to play that way, feel free, but I would never join a group such as that.
Anyone whos inviting people by clicking randomly and hitting /invite, theres a
99.9% chance that the group will not work.   Even if by some miracle they do
have a proper composition, in my experience the players who would accept such
invitations generally don't have a clue how to play.    Considering also that
of the people who do send a tell after I click "no", 99% of the time the tell
is just "join plz"....  I think the assumption they are unable to articulate
themselves beyond clicking a button is a fair one.
