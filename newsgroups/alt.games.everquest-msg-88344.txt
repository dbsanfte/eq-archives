Remember that nightly activity you used to engage in after work every

It was called EATING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

For GAWD'S sakes, man. I know the game is great, but ORDER A FUCKING
PIZZA LIKE THE REST OF US! Just move the phone next to the computer,
have the money counted out ahead of time, and grab it from the delivery
guy between pulls.
