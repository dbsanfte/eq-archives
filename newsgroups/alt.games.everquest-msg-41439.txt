This is an EQ newsgroup and is not a board. There probably are current
event newsgroups though yes.

I don't know, I was once in the diablo newsgroup which many users of
the group had adopted as their OT discussion forum for things which
have nothing to do with diablo. I mentioned that did not seem proper
and they all yelled at me saying that is what OT is for. They had made
the change perm though where as this is only temporary.

I really don't see how you could expect people not to talk about this
in every possible forum, on every street corner, in every chat channel
and in every multiplayer game. Its going to happen, a lot, and for
possibly a long time. Honestly if you don't want to hear about it or
see posts or anything you basically are going to have to go live in a
cave for six months to a year.
