One of the biggest things (for me), was to be able to die and not worry
about the exp.

Not everybody is concerned at any level... but I sure was, I was wayyy too
uptight about dieing (thankfully as a monk it didn't happen much).

Now the only time death pisses me off, is when evilguild_02 decides to wipe
us 5 times in a row as we are moving into nToV, then coh over us and jack
the raid (which luckily hasnt happened in a while)

AA levels.. not having to sit in Sebilis with /lfg on all night, being able
to raid 24/7, being able to do things I skipped out of before, in order to
maximise my leveling

That was for my monk - for my cleric,  aego is a huge reason why I thought
it was worth taking him from 56-60.
And for my mage.. well I see no reason at all for him to be higher than 55 -
and if CoH gets nerfed sometime, I'm sure he can be sacrificed down (see, a
mage *can* be useful on raids!) :)

For my wizard..  well there really is no comparison between levels 1-59, and
60...  they finally truly come alive at 60!
