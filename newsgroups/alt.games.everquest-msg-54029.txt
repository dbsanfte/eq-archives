I dunno, last week sometime.  Maybe it was the week before.  I don't see 
why you value sex so highly though.  EQ will not give you social diseases.  
EQ will not bear you children.  EQ will not want a $50,000 wedding.  

EQ may want another computer of its own, though.  And dedicated internet 
access.  And EQ will also probably break up with me eventually, and break 
my heart.  I hate that.
