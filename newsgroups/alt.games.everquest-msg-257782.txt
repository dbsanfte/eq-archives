This isn't true.  If you are in an LDoN group when they get an 
adventure, and they succede or get a partial success, you will get the 
points as long as you are either online or you log on within a short 
time after.  You will also get a failure if they do, I'm not sure -what- 
you get if they don't fail but you aren't online within that window.

What they can do is deliberately fail the adventure, all leave it and 
then get a new one; this will mean that you don't get credit for their 
success, but it also means that they all get a fail on their record, 
should they care about that (few do, to be honest)

Funny thing is, though, that assuming they can succede without you, the 
fact that they get LDoN points for your success doesn't mean you get 
fewer; unlike XP leeching, where they get a share out of your total, you 
get LDoN points purely on your level versus the level and difficulty of 
the mission, whether there's one person in the group or six, whether all 
help or you do it solo, the points for success are the same.

Its an Affont to my sensibilities to have someone leech off LDoN points 
by deliberately going "LD" after we're partway into the mission, but it 
doesn't actually hurt me other than by reducing my chances of success a 
bit... or maybe not, if it happens that they were actually slowing the 
group down, as some unskilled players will.
