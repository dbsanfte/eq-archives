Well, it's not a PK-fest if that's what you're hinting at. It's a very very
controlled PvP environment. There are only certain areas that you can fight
other players in and you can't fight the people on your side. The problem
with the game is that it has about 2 weeks to a month worth of content and
that's it. You'll be bored in no time. I know I was.
