Don't go to EK. Go to Stonebrunt! Crawling with leopards, tigers,
tigresses etc, and they seem to be the Crag Spider of quality cat pelts.
I got various low, medium, and high quality cat pelts from them - ruined
pelts seem to be a rare drop from them.

They're probably 20s in level, occasional 30ish one - mostly green with
occasional blue to me at 36.
