For a cleric you are right on track for 1H Blunt.  Fighting classes like
War, Pal, etc level their fighting skills at (lvl x5 +5), caster classes
like clerics, Wiz, level their fighting skills at (lvl x4 +4).  Meaning you
will never be a good fighter and you aren't meant to be.  It is a completely
different style of playing to get a cleric to lvl vs. getting a Warrior to
lvl.  That's not really a problem because you can always create another
character if you want to play a different way.
