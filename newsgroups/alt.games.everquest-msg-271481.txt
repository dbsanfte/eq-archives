The right to "unlimited access, 24 / 7, no matter what happens!" is not one of
them.

And here is your quote, btw.   Second paragraph of item 13.

13.  WE PROVIDE THE CD-ROM, THE SOFTWARE, THE ACCOUNT, THE GAME AND ALL OTHER
SERVICES "AS IS."  WE AND OUR SUPPLIERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Without limiting the foregoing, we do
not ensure continuous, error-free, secure or virus-free operation of the
CD-ROM, the Software, the Game, your Account or continued operation or
availability of any given server. Some states do not allow limitations as to
how long an implied warranty lasts and/or exclusions or limitations of
consequential damages, so the above limitations and/or exclusions of liability
may not apply to you.  This warranty gives you specific legal rights and you
may also have other legal rights which vary from state to state.

We are not liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from any
causes beyond our reasonable control. Further, we cannot and do not promise or
ensure that you will be able to access your Account whenever you want, and
there may be extended periods of time when you cannot access your Account.
You assume the entire risk as to the results and performance of the Software
and the Game in connection with your hardware and software, and you assume the
entire cost of all servicing, repair and/or correction of your hardware and
software.
