Frist off the Shaman's pet is at 34, and a 34 Shamans pet is weaker then the
Enchanters 29 pet. I have a 52 Shaman and have never seen a Dark Blue Pet
seen some lite blue, but most have always been green. Shaman have 2nd best
healing abilities and great Dots but someone has to Tank. At 50 my Shaman
could solo HGs with his 49 pet, 2 DOTs and healing pet, and slowing.
Personally I don't think it would be a good combo you would be better off
with a Druid or a Ranger to Snare.
