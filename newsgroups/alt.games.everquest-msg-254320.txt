Hi All

So nice not to have to spend 60% of my mana summoning/buffing a pet
every time I have to zone.

Pets shrink using Tiny Companion again, but, interestingly, they do
not shrink via the Shrink spell, which they used to.  I further
noticed that if Shrink is cast on a pet that has had Tiny Companion
already cast on it, the pet grows to full size again!  Might be useful
to know, maybe.

That said, PoK is sure going to be cluttered with pets now...  Oh, I
can see the lag now, lol.
