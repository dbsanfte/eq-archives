Everquest is written for Player Versus Environment.  For cooperative play.
Grouping is encouraged at low levels, and downright damned near required for
upper...so start grouping early, make friends, maybe join a guild that
you've researched & found to your liking.

They have PvP servers but it was obviously an afterthought, considering how
poorly they've done it.

Everquest is often described as "very addictive."  Though I don't agree with
the word "addictive," I can't really think of a better word.  What I CAN say
is that you'd be better off if you never played the game.  It's been used by
many couples as THE reason for the break up, which is bullshit of
course...nothing can break up a relationship except the people in that
relationship...using a GAME as an excuse is just refusal to take
responsibility.
