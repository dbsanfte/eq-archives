Take a bunch of PP out of the bank, then travel to
a heavily hunted zone that's far from a bank
(preferably one where the mobs drop a lot of copper,
silver, and gold).

Then every once in a while /shout that you'll
exchange pp for people's gp/sp/cp, at a bit less
than equivalent exchange rates.  For example,
you'll give someone 1p for every 12gp.  That
way you make 20% on every transaction.

The benefit for your "customers" is that they
can unload 30 pounds of coins (or whatever) and
get back under their weight limit, without having
to either waste time running back to town, or
simply destroying the excessive coins.

When your pp run out or you're way overloaded
yourself, gate back to the bank (Gate-able classes
make the best bankers), unload, refresh your pp
stock, and repeat.

In zones where there aren't any food vendors,
enterprising "bankers" often will bring a ton of
food/water with them and sell them at a heavy markup.
Another service is to go to a zone where Fine Steel
weapons drop a lot (e.g. Cazic-Thule), and buy them
from players for 3 or 4p each.  You sell them back to
merchants for 5-6p each, and the players make money
by being able to sell the FS weapons for *something*,
instead of just leaving them to rot (FS weapons are
too heavy for a player hunting in the zone to pick up
and keep every one until he can get back to town).

...and so on.  There are always new opportunities
for people who can figure out how to buy cheap and
sell high, due to differing supply/demand in different
zones.  Personally, I like to bring a backpack full
of resist jewelry/armor to pickup dragon raids, and
then /auction them off to people who came unprepared
just before the action starts.  :-)
