OK, Since Jakugg invited me along last night and since I had to refuse to go
because of RL issues (cough) chicken (cough), I need some details.  Did you
do the thing were after killing the gaints, everyone started buffing, then
camping out and waiting in the chatroom for all to be buffed and for mana to
be full? About how many were there and what levels? How low did you get the
ice queen in health? details!!!
