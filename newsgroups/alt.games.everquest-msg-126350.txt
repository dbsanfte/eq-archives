Ahh yep - forgot them. She is wearing Bloodsoaked Mantle (6ac 3str) so the
Crested Spaulders would be a great upgrade, thanks.

I may even be able to send the Chimp in to get them too if I can't find them
in auction. The last time he visited Mistmoore the Gimp had a regular party
whilst Chimp was just sitting back scratching his head and looking at a
growing list of faction message: bad pathing in there. Now with the pet
aggro changes it should be a lot more manageble though.
