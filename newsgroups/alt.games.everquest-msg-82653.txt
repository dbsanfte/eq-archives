I have to agree with Raneu... Thats probably a mental condition. With proper
hard disk maintenence you should rarely , if ever, have to reformat you hard
drives. Of course if you are doing this from a restore disk then its not
real format anyway IMO. If you have multiple partitions then formating
becomes a pain in the arse.

dont try this unless you know what you are doing but....

C:\FORMAT C: /U/S

This will wipe the drive of just about everything and replace crucial system
files. If the /u (unconditional) switch scares you then just do
C:\FORMAT C: /S

Thats about as safe as it gets. At least then the partition will be
bootable.

Just my thoughts
