You can at least turn off the bard songs and effects with a few clicks or
keystrokes--not that I disagree with you.  My least favorite is when some
bard puts on Chords of Dissonance in the Bazaar and leaves it there for
hours.

"Bard tries to cast a spell on you, but you are protected.

It'd be nice if we could "walk through" players to avoid problems with
banks, doorways, etc. being blocked.  That'd probably make more problems
than it'd solve, though (harder to target players for buffs, assist, or
PVP).
