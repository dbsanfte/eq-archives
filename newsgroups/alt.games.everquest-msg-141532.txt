Unlimited snake skins are sold by a vendor in Field of Bone near East
Cabilis.  I'm sure they are there to provide the component for an early
iksar shaman spell, since there are no snakes (I think) anywhere on Kunark.
I wouldn't be surprised if there was a similar vendor near Shar Vahl, since
I can't recall seeing any snakes near there either.
