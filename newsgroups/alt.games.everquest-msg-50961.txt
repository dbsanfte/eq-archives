Currently the helm would appear to have no graphic for all races but I had
heard a rumour that there is a quest you can do to obtain a graphic for this
helm. I heard that the quest starts in Velious.

Can anyone confirm this?.

Thank you,

Moodel Ledoom, 39th order holy knight of Brell Serillis, Xev.
