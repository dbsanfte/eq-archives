Font 1, 2, 3 are tiny, but scale gradually up to
4, the default... So I think great, then 5 or maybe
6 will be just right on my piddly little 15 inch flatscreen.

5 is huge.  5 is also the largest.

Does anyone use a size smaller than 3?  On what,
a 36 inch plasma?

I'd like to see the range extended up so the current
5 is at about 8, and 5, 6, and 7 are intermediate steps...
or if raw number of sizes is a problem, eliminate sizes
2 and 3 and put a couple sizes between 4 and 5 that way.

Course I've not heard anyone else complaining so far,
so perhaps this is a solution in search of a problem
