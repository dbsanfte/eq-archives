Velious quest armor just isn't that good anymore.  Characters who
are _way_ short of being able to one-group the dragons you must
farm for the better velious armor can easily farm cash enough to
buy comparable or even superior gear in bazaar.

Outside of special situations, say opening a new server which
prohibits transfers like Stromm, you won't ever see mid-levels
hunting their own gear in significant numbers ever again in EQ.
Droppable gear that's worth anything is instantly permacamped
by farmers, and they seem to have great difficulty with the
concept of making quests that are reasonably completeable by
non-raiders to whom the reward would actually be meaningful.
(Yeah, there are some contrary examples, whoop-dee-doo.  That's
why my statement wasn't absolute.)

They really blew it with LDoN.  There should be quality NODROP
loot dropping in LDoNs.  It should be class-restricted (i.e.
tuned to a particular group of related classes, don't lump Bards
and Clerics with tanks, don't lump Monks and BLs with Druids, &
etc.), but NOT level restricted (the instances are already level
restricted).  And every drop should be usable by at least one of
the players in the group, none of this nobody can use the NODROP
spell BS like they did in GoD (i.e. do things like check the
classes in the group when you itemize the instance and maybe
you'll convince us your programming team isn't actually composed
of brain-dead slugs).  The AP bought armor should be level
restricted and fairly generic, inferior to the dropped armor
available at the level it's for (i.e. fill-in the gap stuff
because you can't count on all your slots being filled with
random drop stuff).  AP bought gear should also be tradeable,
rather than the stupid 70% sell-back.
