Try the crazed goblins in butcherblock. They drop fine steel, metal armor,
and platinum, and close vendors, bank and port in. If you want more loot
then you probably need to hunt indoors. After you get your quadding
lightning spell at 34, and maybe a few more levels, try quadding spectres in
oasis. Youll be making over 100p per hour there, and the xp is great too.
FInding them uncamped isnt necesarily easy. Seems only reason people go to
oasis anymore is for the spectres and epics. Theres a 4 spawn of them in
oot, but if youre using KEI (who isnt these days) then youll be sitting
around a lot. (Oasis is 8 spawns, just rigt for quading)
