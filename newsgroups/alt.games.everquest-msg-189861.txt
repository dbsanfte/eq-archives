Actually, pre-Kunark this isn't quite correct.  Because the
HP difference wasn't huge before level 50, and because the
very best armor (Rubicite) could be worn by rangers - Rangers
could tank as well as warriors - and had spells.

When they removed rubicite from CT and put in class specific
armor quests, the pendulum started to swing the other way -
to the extent that rangers became underpowered.

It was (IIRC) during the melee balancing that they were moved
to a higher damage table.
