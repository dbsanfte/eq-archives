Kael is not that hard to go trough, if you don't consider getting a
map cheating :) i had one when i passed trough kael at lvl 3, got some
tips that i should stay away from the arena area since the giants
there see trough hide/sneak, wakening lands is in some ways like toxx
:) not as dark perhaps but lots of trees rather close making it hard
to see mobs at times, no worries for me using hide/sneak since nothing
could see trough it (notable exception is woushi i guess, but he was
away on holliday when i got the key :) )  my computer is also rather
slow so this zone was a bit slow and framerate probably low (can you
see acctual FPS??) last time i passed the zone i did see a unicorn and
some flying mobs, also passed right by the entrance to POG, got myself
into skyshrine and was alowed to get the SS key from Ziglark that
another high level rogue killed, i was way impressed with the damage
he did, the text scrolled almost constantly :)

Had a bit of a scary moment when trying to use to portal in SS,
klicked it and it said 'you are to far away to use that' then i got
scared that my hide/sneak would have dropped but thankfully it did
not,cobalt scar was nice but i only picked up the key there and tried
get into sirens grotto, but lvl 3 swimming skill and hide sneak made
me swim like, well very slow and i drowned since you have to swim
below the water rather long :(

All in all a very nice trip :)

Can't wait until my lvl 20 necro grows up a bit and can fight in IC.
