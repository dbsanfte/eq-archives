Charm mobs in PoD & PoN using your pet charm spell (lvl52/53?), i did this 
up to lvl 59 (it starts to get slow at 57/58), its great xp and takes hardly 
any mana up.   It might take some getting used to and at the lower levels 
you get more resits and charm breaks but once you have mastered it you can 
get a boat load of xp in no time, my personal favourite was the treants 
which are north if i remember from the zone in line in PoN
