The Bazaar is part of the Shadows of Luclin expansion, not PoP, but if 
you got your copy of EQ off a magazine coverdisk, chances are it only 
includes the old world.

Still, old world gives you plenty of scope to figure out whether you 
like the game or not. If you do, I recommend you buy the Gold Edition, a 
nice box with all expansions in it, and some tat.
