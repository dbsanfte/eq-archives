Hi! And thanks for any responses.
   I started hunting in East Karana last night and killed, among other
things, 2 crag spiders and a carrion spider.  Between them, they dropped
1 spider silk and 1 venom sack.  I believe that when I was hunting there
a few months ago, I was getting more like 2 to 4 silks per crag spider.
   I asked if the lower drop rate was the norm now and got an
affirmative response.
   Just in case I and the few players in EK were all getting a run of
bad luck, I thought I would ask here to make sure I'm not deluding
myself.

   If they didn't lower the drop rate for all spiders and the lower drop
rate for the EK crags is the norm now, then my second question is: Why
would they make the drop rate for crag spiders a lot lower than the drop
rate for the large spiders in Nektulos Forest?  Shouldn't a tougher
monster give a greater reward?

   Again, thanks to anyone how can answer my questions and or explain
what I might be misunderstanding.
