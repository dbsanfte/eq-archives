Nope, I carry my own peridots.  If I want a symbol, I give the the cleric a
'dot.  Personally, I think this should be the way it goes, my HP, my
responsibility.

People like me, who see clerics pulling in far more in gems than they spend
in symbols?  Sorry, I don't buy that as a cleric's right.  Maybe they should
give Shamen and Druids better heals, so clerics wouldn't have as much
leverage in the gem business.

I've got no problem with clerics getting their fair share, nor do I think
they should foot the bill for symbols.  It's when they demand their "candy"
that I've got issues.  My way around it?  Don't go to zones where cleric
candy is the rule.  May limit me later in my character's life.... so be it,
I don't have enough time available to do uber stuff anyways.
