That being said, there's still some things not showing up right for my
character.

AA's that I've spent aren't showing right.
Some bags are showing empty and not with the right number of slots(ie:
deluxe sewing kit is showing as 4 slots, not 10).

Some minor quirks, but once ironed out, I think I'll like it quite a
bit.
