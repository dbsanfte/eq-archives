I think you misunderstood me, Leather Goddess.  I believe your point of view
on this issue is the correct one.

Although I didn't word my first post like this, my real intention was not to
bait someone into tempting others into stealing their account.  It was only
to imply that most of us have not been victims of computer crime (and for
that matter, almost all other forms of crime) largely because we are just
another face in the crowd to the would-be perpetrator.  It's the anonymity,
and the fact that the hacker doesn't have any special reason to go after one
person over any other that provides some measure of security.

If a person surrenders that off-beat form of security (and one way to do
that is to throw down the gauntlet in front of true computer criminals who
know what they're doing) then I do believe that they are at greatly
increased risk of having their account stolen.  I also agree that an account
with real world value would just sweeten the pot here.

But it's important to keep one thing in mind, anyway.  Besides losing
account security through negligence or through being specifically targeted,
a person can just be unlucky.  If a hacker uses a brute force scheme
(testing various combinations of possible user names and passwords until one
sticks), then some unlucky SOB just had his security comprimised without
having done one goddamned thing to deserve it.  Of course, brute force is
the most inefficient method, but computers never get bored or tired, and the
hackers that prefer this method (perjoritively referred to as "script
kiddies" -- the least dangerous but most common variety) have all the
patience in the world.

It's a sick society that teaches its people that all victims must have done
something to deserve what they get.
