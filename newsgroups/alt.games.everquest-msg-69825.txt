I'm at 1024x768 with medium quality textures, and everything else turned on.
Getting good enough frame rates in all the world. Not perfect everywhere but
certainly good enough.

That's with 700Mhz P3, 512M ram, Geforce 3 Ti 200 64M

With my old Geforce2 Mx the frame rate was ok, with the new video card
it's much better.
