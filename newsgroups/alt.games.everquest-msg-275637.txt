Oh man, that reminds me of all the myths that floated around EQ in the
early days.  Many probably persist now.  I heard that one about using
blunt weapons against skellies.  A very popular one was not to use
slashing against wolves because it increased the risk of damaging the
pelt.  Ah, when we were young and innocent...

Another one that probably still persists (and some here may still
argue about it) was that if you didn't loot corpses, new mobs wouldn't
spawn.  That never was true, but people got pissed if you told them
so.  I don't like leaving areas littered with corpses, but it doesn't
affect spawn rate.
