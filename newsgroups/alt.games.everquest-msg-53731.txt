I've never had a bad time breaking Hate, but we have always broken at
zone in.  I still can't see why folks run when you have a nice, quiet
house to start in.  In fact I can't think of a single break-in death
in Hate.  Fear on the other hand can be a complete and utter bastard
if you get stupid and try to break with the first 12 who show up.
Several big guilds (including mine) have been humbled and had to ask
for help when things just go to hell.
