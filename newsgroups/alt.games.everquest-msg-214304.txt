My current specs:
350Mhz Celeron (clocked to 333 due to some MB 'issues')
128MB Ram
3dfx voodoo 3
blah...blah...blah...

I have to kill the clip plane in the bazaar and Pok, but who doesn't.

Also got most graphic effects tweaked right down (no hi-res models,
particle effects are negligible)

Oh yeah, no sound either. And a 14" replacement monitor due to the 19"
blowing a fuse.

But I don't have a problem playing the game per se. I've been having a
lot of fun since returning a month ago and just recently getting
Evolutions.  Just the 10-15 min start time and the 2 min zone times
suck.

So it is possible to play the game with less than the minimum
requirements.  Its just not quite the same experience.

Anyone out there running it with less?
