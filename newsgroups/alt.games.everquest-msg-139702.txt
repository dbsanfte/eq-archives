i usually lurk in AGVX to laugh at the trolls, i have to comment here.
 First up:

>  I keep hearing that the Bush administration is against letting pilots be
> armed in the cockpit, but not once have I heard their reasons.

Maybe someone in the Bush administration has enough of a clue to
realise that, after going to all the lengths that we do to stop
hijackers from getting weapons on to aircraft, mandating there to be
one in the cockpit is a bit of a bad idea...  no offense mate, but its
just the of the silliest things ive ever heard of.

To the original, deranged posting, i simply ask from what parallel
dimension you read this 'newspaper'.  Please tell me what paper it
was, as it is a quite incredible piece of fiction.  Firstly we do not
have soliders at political conferences.  We may have armed police, but
thats due to counter-terroist measures - yes, americans, the war on
terror is not new here, and has been going on for a couple of decades
in Britain, Spain and France.
Then the premise of the alledged article is nothing more than a
politial rheotoric.  We have many strange, antiquated laws on our
statues in the UK, often the source of much amusement (example: Cabs
are required to carry a bail of hay to feed their houses and cover
excrement!), because we didn't have the oppurtunity to start from
scratch in the late 1770's.  Most of these law are either obsolete and
unenforced, or in the case of this topic, superceded by more modern
laws.  It takes time to repleal a law (as it does in the US) and
legislaters would rather spend time bringing in new law to improve our
lot than pull apart old ones.  Nobody is about to bring in new laws
allowing touture, and the Right Honourable Member for Banff and Buchan
is the leader of a small nationist party, that does not accept that
free and fair elections voted in a non-seperatist scottish parliment. 
He is just playing up for his crowd, and what he says has little
meaning or bearing on the life of ordinary people.

As for gun control, you will observe that us terribly oppressed
Britons and other europeans have far fewer armed-robbery's, murders
and High School shootings than your average american state.  A fair
price in my opinion.
