That will be useful to give one's Bazaar mule the money to buy the trader's
satchels.   The satchels are NO DROP (anyone know why?).

They could have solved this without a plat transfer slot.  Just put a new
set of items on vendors:

    Small Bar of Platinum
    Bar of Platinum
    Large Bar of Platinum
    Giant Bar of Platinum

These would each be stackable.  The merchant would sell them for 1p, 10p,
100p, and 1000p, respectively, and would buy them back for the same price.
