I was hunting frost giants in Eastern Wastes last night and went
linkdead during a fight.  I have a level 46 Bard on Brell Serillis. 
When I logged back to the game my character was "naked" when the
character select screen appeared.

I'm running a cable modem and my connection never dropped last night. 
Does anyone on this newsgroup play on the Brell Serillis server and
notice any connection problems last night?  Will a GM give me a rez if
I plead my case?

The zone was unusually laggy last night and I probably should have
just travelled to another zone to see if it was indeed my connection
that was the problem.
