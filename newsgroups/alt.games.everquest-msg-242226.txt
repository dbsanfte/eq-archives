i take damage for my group all the time.  and by group i mean a necro (me)
and a rogue.  the way i see it, i got DoT spells going on every monster in
the mob and to cast more is probably a waste of mana cuz we'd have to stop
and rest too much, so i just cast leach on a few monsters and run up to soak
up damage while drawing attention away from the rogue, after all, the
leaches do bring in a fair amount of HP every six seconds.  i call it my
living shield technique.
