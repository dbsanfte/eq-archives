I wear a Robe of Living Fungus. Most of the "uber" equipment I can buy 
won't show up over it. A horse will. Besides, I'm a mostly soloing Druid 
with a wisdom of well over 200. I don't *need* any new equipment, at 
least until (if ever) I feel like doing Dragon raids.

So I bougth a horse because I felt like it. Not all of us are 
calculator-wielding min-maxers, some of us play EQ for the fun.

Isn't that cool?
