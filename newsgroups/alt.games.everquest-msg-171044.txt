I'm almost certain its by class.  Here's my reasoning.

1) Your armor is a composite of many different pieces.  While it would be
possible to use a hit location table and then check results for each spot
(especially since this IS a computer game we are talking about) there's no
indication this is being done.  It would also be possible to compute the
average type of armor being worn, or to use just the breastplate location,
of course.  SO its possible this is happening, but I've yet to hear anyone
hint that they think it is.  With all the warriors out there using a fungi
tunic to solo with, you'd think this would be quite noticable.

2) A warrior in 1000AC gets hit less hard than a cleric or bard in 1000AC,
even after you factor out his better dodge/parry/block/riposte, and even
with both having same defense skill.   There IS a class based factor, and
its always been refered to as a "table" rather than a simple multiplier.
This seems to indicate that mitigation is class based rather than armor type
based.

3) A monk with 1250 AC today gets hit a lot harder than a monk with 1250 AC
did a few months ago.  This is, they say, because they changed his defense
table.  If they had changed the "leather" table, then druids should have
noticed a similar change in mitigation (although since druids tank rarely at
high levels, perhaps they wouldn't notice after all.)
