First of all, someone made it sound like they thought my group was stupid
for sitting through 5 trains of wolves and mushrooms.

In that case, we weren't sitting at the entrance to ME, but on the hill next
to it, closer to GE than NL. The wolves and shrooms just aggroed on us the
first time for some reason anyway (I'm not sure, but I think one of the
group members was standing in the entrance to get a better view of the
Tribals. I was sitting on the hill medding at the time). After the second
time it happened, we started preparing for it. After all, why run when you
can hack through the shrooms and wolves pretty easily if you're ready for
it?

Second of all, the case where I got trained by the Rockhopper was the ONLY
time I was actually sitting IN the entranceway to ME. After that, I quit
sitting inside there, and started sitting on the hill (again, GE side, not
closest to NL - I'm not THAT stupid) so I could see trains coming, but its
hard to when you're either:

a. Engaged in combat

or

b. Have your spellbook open memorizing spells. (Thank God they changed it so
you don't have it open to Meditate anymore!)

I know there are times when you CAN'T warn someone you're hauling a train to
zone or lose control of mobs you're hunting, but it seems like there are a
LOT of people who aren't even considerate enough to warn when they clearly
can. I've been in zones where the same exact moron causes multiple trains
and NEVER warns anyone when it happens on more occasions that I'd care to
mention (`Same moron' meaning the same person causing the train each time in
a zone, not the same moron causing all these trains in all the zones!).

One particular instance that comes to mind is when I was in Oasis with one
of my alts (My Druid). A Bard trying to kite Spectres in Oasis of Marr lost
control and didn't warn anyone. Oh, he warned people he was going to do it,
but not when he lost control of the Specs. And he was kiting them on the
North Ro side of the zone instead of the South Ro side, which is a big
no-no. Nevermind the fact that a Spectre is so slow that it can be outran
even at normal running speed, leaving him with plenty of time to run
somewhere using Selo's, type a warning, then go round them up. People kept
dying because of this idiot, and unfortunately I was one of them. Hard to
outrun a Spectre when it jumps you while you're trying to kill a Croc and
don't see it coming, isn't it?

I know AT LEAST 7 other people died because of this, and I wouldn't be
surprised if a lot more did, but logged off in disgust instead of recovering
their corpse.

Iirc, a high lvl Paladin who happened to be travelling through the zone
after the Specs got loose finally helped the Bard take care of the problem,
and the Bard had sense enough to leave Oasis. At least, that's what I heard.
(I recovered my corpse and got out of the zone, and someone who heard me
complain in the zone as I was leaving sent me a tell later on). If I hear a
Bard is kiting, I leave whatever zone I'm in asap as a result of this and
one other bad experience I'd rather not talk about. I like Bards in groups,
but can't stand to be in a zone where one is trying to kite mobs while
soloing.

Fortunately, I've been far away from the train and the zone line in almost
all of those occasions, but I know people who have died because of these
idiots.
