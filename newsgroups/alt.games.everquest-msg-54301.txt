Got to disagree with this. You can make very fast xp using dots an damage
shield and treeform (regen) till about level 35, assuming you get good armor
class gear. After that it gets a bit tough, but at least you have your
defense up to 175 or 180 or so... heck its free ac and its gonna be almost
impossible to train when you get to your 50's (blues will cut you to
pieces).
Sure, that extra defense/armor class will be worthless when your training at
55 in skyfire, but wont it be nice when your down some dungeon with a couple
of agro greens on you.
