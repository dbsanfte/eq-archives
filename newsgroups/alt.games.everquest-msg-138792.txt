All prices are based off of Tarew Marr.

Lose eboots for coldain skin. (after resale of eboots, probably little to no
money lost) (5 ac 9 wis/int on Eboots vs. 2 ac 8 wis/int 35 mana on coldain)

Lose the "+5 range item" (medicine totem?) for a Ceremonial Smudging Stick
(1k) (3 ac 3 wis 30 mana 10 sv fire/magic/poison)

Get a thurgadin leather bracer MQ (probably around 5k) (need 3 crushed opals
also) and sell the ES arms for Nathsar arms(1k max for nathsar)

Shroud of Nature (BP) (800 max) (13 ac 6 wis 8 sv fire/cold)

Dark Ember (500-800) (13/32 1hb 2 str 5 wis 20 hp/mana 7 sv fire, procs a 14
pt fire nuke)

Tattered Hide Cloak (4-5k last time I saw one for sale) (9 ac 6 sta/wis 55
hp/mana 8 sv disease)

Obulus Death Shroud (6-8k) (shoulder 10 ac 3 str 5 sta 3 wis 25 mana 1 sv
all, effect: Mana Preservation III (10% off mana cost on all spells except
CH (which druids never get =p))

Shadel Bandit Ring (2-3k) (6 ac 55 hp/mana 10 sv disease 5 sv cold effect:
summoning haste II (useless))

Diamond Wedding Band (1k) (ring 2 ac 5 wis/int 3 dex 15 mana 8 sv fire/cold)

Coldain Skin Gloves (2-3k) (12 ac 6 wis/int 9 sta 20 hp/mana)
Grey Flesh Gloves (2k) (6 ac 6 wis/int

Enshrouded Veil (500) (face 7 ac 2 wis/int 30 hp/mana 10 sv fire effect:
summoning efficiency III (bear pet!))

Orb of the Infinite Void (10-12k) (shield 35 ac 5 wis/int 75 hp/mana)

Luminescent Staff (4-6k) (13/33 2hb 7 wis 35 hp/mana, clickable 10 second
casting Lightning Strike, the level 34 AE) if you quad kite a lot. (still
useful otherwise for outdoor mana free nuking, but not as much).

Grab a Square Helm (12 ac 3 agi 6 wis) for 6k or scavenge a Supple Scale
Armband (bracer no drop 3 ac 5 wis/int 25 mana 10 sv fire) from Karnors
(they rot a lot) for the Extended Range III effect if you get a Lumi staff
though, the 10 sec cast time is just nearly enough for snared things to get
from max lumi range to melee range, and you WILL get hit if you aren't
careful.

Pick and choose depending on your priorities though.  I'd go for the Obulus
shroud and Enshrouded Veil no matter what though, the ODS effect is amazing,
and the Enshrouded Veil is just a good deal.

Most of these suggestions are just based off my own equipment though.  Most
of it I've had for a while anyways. (Dark Ember since level 28 or so =/ )

I'm personally favorable towards +hp/mana gear though, wisdom just doesn't
mean much anymore, post-200 isn't worth the trouble, and once you get some
higher end stuff, 255 is easy.  Saves are good too, but +hp have more
general usage.  You aren't high enough though to tap the true power of the
ES arms though IMO (winged death + free drones)  I had a pair waiting for
when I made 45, used them until I got my thurg bracer MQ'd at 47 or 48,
they're useful, but I personally ended up using drifting death to kill
faster at least once or twice a fight if I was root/rotting.

You only want to buy gear, but if you were willing, you could probably
wander out to UP and get some Elysian that's rotting, it wouldn't have quite
as good of stats as it does for me (recommended level 51), but it's still
incredibly good... except the gloves... they really suck unless you're still
wearing split paw.  I just got my Elysian BP (solo) a couple days ago, and
it feels like an epic on my chest, heh.  Plus I look like a newbie ranger
now (yay?).
