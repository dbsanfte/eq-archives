    Nope.

    Nope, but they'll do it whether you have the tag up or not. I don't know
about your server - I've heard some like Fennin Ro have a lot of
roleplayers - but on mine the /roleplay tag is used to avoid buff beggars
while still showing a guild tag by the vast majority of people with it up.
People will ruin your roleplaying experience ANYWAYS, whether the tag is up
or not, until you show them with actions that you're roleplaying. At least
that's always been my experience - a good friend of mine kept it up at all
times, and was a roleplayer, and people NEVER clued in until she started
talking to them.
