Hi,

Tried to enter sirens grotto last night, but i drowned in the tunnel
before i zoned, probably because i was using hide/sneak so my swimming
was even slower than normal, question here is how far aggro range has
the siren outside the entrance? say if i swim in to the tunnel a bit
and then turn of hide/sneak to gain some speed will she attack?

Drowning was on the other hand a quick way to get back to Nektulos :)
