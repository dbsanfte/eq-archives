STR affects your max and, therefore, average damage *slightly* though by no
means enough to warrant getting +STR items (mebbe if rogue or monk, even
then it's debateable). DEX has an affect on any procs, again it's only a
slight affect and not worth getting +DEX stuff.
The only stat worth looking at is STA, hps determine how long you can stand
there hitting the mob.
The normal overview of what you look for is: Level, AC, HPs, Resists.
Depending on scenario, resists can move to: Level, Resists, AC, HPs.
