    Shrug. I'll go tell the main tank in my guild that soloed (and WITHOUT
the bot cleric he just got, I really do mean soloed) 100 AA points that he's
really the suck, and he should stop it now. Or the other warriors I see
plowing through shroom patches in FG.

    Being able to Bind Wounds to 50 and still kill the next blue is huge.
Rogues don't have the HPs to do that, which is why they make poor soloists
in comparison even when they get a Mrylokar's BP to heal up or have space to
fear kite. I remember my rogue soloing in Sol B. She could just handle 2
blues every 28 minutes - she HAD to heal to near full before engaging or she
would die, and HAD to take on shaman mobs that would pause to cast
easily-resisted spells so she could get in backstabs every so often. My
warrior, at the same relative gear level and same character level, is
murdering mobs the same level with just enough pause to bandage up. Trust
me - they can do it.
