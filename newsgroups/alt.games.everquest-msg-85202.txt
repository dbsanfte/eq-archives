Hfl dru here too and killed Dylin Starsine for the ToV part.  So far so good
in Qeynos, although to be honest I haven't done much other than hang at the
city entrance and buff newbs when I'm bored and in the area.

I'm really having a hard time wanting/trying to replace that ToV.  That
+10wis in the hand is pretty special to me, even still at 48.  The ToV plus
the Paw of Opalla in my other hand leaves me with +19 wis and some mana in
my hands alone.

What's this skull you're talking about?
