CHeal isnt' the end all be all heal spell... but the class that has it also
has all the other best heal spells in the game.  HOT rocks 44 to 50
and doesn't suck 50 to 58... and then the new HOT completely
rocks.  Dunno about the lowbie HOT, it doesn't look like a good
ratio compared to similar heals.

While shaman can heal adequately for most encounters because
they can slow mobs to where they don't do much damage, the
fact is till high levels their actual heals suck in comparison to cleric
heals... slow the mob and have a cleric healer and you are still
better off in terms of raw mana expended for healing.  Druids
don't have the slow ability, and their heals suck even worse than
shaman, so you are even worse off relying on druid healing...even
if you have shaman or chanter doing massive slows.  Its -possible-
to choose situations where you can use shaman or druid healer as
your primary healer, but it takes some effort and entails some added
risk... and when you fail you don't have the handy rez to make it
all better.
