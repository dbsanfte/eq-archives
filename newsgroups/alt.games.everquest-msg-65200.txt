Not sure if it's exactly the same, but my wife's caster found that as
soon as she sat down to med, everything froze. Sitting was fine, but if
she opened the book and began to meditate, the chat screen and
everything else froze up, including mana and health bars, until she
stood up again. Very annoying. However, after we installed the new video
card and drivers, that went away. Not sure if this will help or not, but
she previously had a nVidia TNT 16 MB card with the default drivers.
Switched to the Appolo Geforce 2 MX 400 with whatever drivers windows
found for it on the install, and the problem went away. No more freezes
while medding.
