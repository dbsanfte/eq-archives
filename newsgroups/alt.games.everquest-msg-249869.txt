You make a good point here.  It's not really feasible to shrink the world.
The only way to re-populate the huge barren expanses of Norrath that I can
think of is to revamp all the deserted zones and do some server
consolidation.  But revamping all the deserted zones costs SOE money and
doesn't have an obvious ROI, making it unlikely that SOE would do it.  If
some server consolidation happened, it would have to go hand-in-hand with
revamping under-used content, otherwise as Mr. 42 pointed out in another
post, you'd just make already-crowded zones even more crowded, and under-
used zones would probably remain under-used.

In the end, I think all this just means EverQuest is past its prime, and
on an inevitable decline.  In the minds of SOE executives, I suspect EQ2
is the future anyway.  I can only hope some SOE employees read this news-
group and adjust the design of EQ2 in a positive way based on our discussions
here.
