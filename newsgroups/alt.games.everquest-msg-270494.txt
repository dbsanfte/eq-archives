Hey, I have been one of the level appropriate clerics though 65 levels 
and there have always been better buffs than mine at every level, even 
now with Conviction. I no sooner get Virtue and HoV, than OOW comes 
along with Conviction and people will leave my group to go to PoK for it 
and another what, 300 hitpoints? Oh, well... I don't care. I like 
getting Conviction myself when I can.

That's small potatoes. Sure my groupmates may prefer a buff superior to 
what I have to offer but so what? The fact is, they aren't going to get 
too far without my other abilities so it isn't like I am sitting around 
LFG over it. In my experience, fellow lower level clerics are very happy 
to get temp and virtue from me. I have yet to ever hear a complaint from 
anyone about it.

And how did KEI and Virtue "whores" screw up EQ? If you are a chanter or 
cleric and don't want to be bothered with tells for buffs it's easy 
enough to go anonymous. It also makes sense not to go with a stupid name 
like "Ibemezn" or "HealerBoy", etc.

I have both a high level cleric and chanter and personally I enjoy 
helping people out with buffs. When I am short on cash it's a nice 
source of a some plat when I need it, although for the most part I 
prefer to just buff people for free.

I guess there's one good thing I can say for Conviction. I don't need to 
have anonymous on. People my level aren't interested in Virtue anymore. 
Fine by me.
