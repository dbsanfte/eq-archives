Daoc does not have a downtime problem . In eq fixing this would be as simple
as doubling the mana regeneration rate. (would fix caster balance issues as
well )

Daoc has a much better system for tradeskills . Fixing tradeskills in eq is
tricky . They would have to figure what the absolute best equipment that
could ever be dropped and make craftable items at similiar usefullness and
works backwards from uber to newbieness for all the tradeskills.

Daoc has made a whole slew of mistakes all its own . The biggest problem
though is a pvp based game that requires 6 monthes of boredom to be pvp
ready . An hour to run to proper pvp position . A predetermined result for
who managed to bring the most people . A lack of balance between the classes
. And finally to make it all worthwhile a reward that must unbalance things
further so that the losing side has an even harder task next time . Flawed
by design . Shame :(
