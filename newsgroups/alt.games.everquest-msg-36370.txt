Run like hell?  :)

I've not played a wizard very seriously - I have one, but she's low
level. So, the question is - are there any secondary roles you can
play?

As a druid, if my group pulls something too high for me to cast on, I
fall back to a support role. I keep my eye on the health of my group
mates, cast heals where needed, maybe a debuff on the monster, etc.
But above all, I try to make sure I'm ready for the next fight, where
I may be able to act more directly.

Have a seat. Wizzies are even worse at melee than druids!

Sounds like it. That way you'll be ready when your group pulls
something that you can put a hurting on.
