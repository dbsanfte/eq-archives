Iksar are fun, but probably not a good newbie class.  They're pretty much 
globally hated by the NPCs in the game, which makes shopping and baking 
somewhat of a chore.  That said, Kunark is a part of the cheapest starter 
pack type thing so you may as well grab it.  It's also one of the 
standard places to lvl from 30-50ish.

Again, part of the cheapest starter pack.  Lots of guilds still raid 
Velious.

I'd suggest getting this one for the bazaar functionality.  Stupid crap 
you can loot while it still gives you experience points as a newbie 
sometimes sells very well here, allowing you to get better gear, making 
your life easier.

Incredibly glad I bought this one (think my highest was lvl 42 when I got 
it).  The travel system and having (almost) all your spells in one spot 
is really a big help.  Not to mention tradeskill vendors if you're into 
that sort of thing ;)  Also a nice spot to pick up buffs etc.

Depending on your budget, this is the one I'd get.

The LFG (looking for group) tool is nice, especially if people on your 
server actually use it (general concensus is that not a lot of people use 
it)!  Cartography is VERY nice, especially when you're unfamiliar with a 
zone (as you will be to all zones).  You can download pre-made maps at 
http://www.eqatlas.com/.  If you're on a nice connection, I'd buy it if 
you have the money.
