 no I haven't gone anywhere :)

newsgroup etiquette?  What a concept, we can put that right beside the
pornography and these funny names.
Like Remington Stone, now that is funny lololorof, been watching a little
bit to much TV?
And curve, I probably didn't miss that by much when I commented about your
weight, that's curve as in one big one starting about your neck arcing to
your waist.


There's one thing that's obvious, considering the number of post each of you
have made in this newsgroup of well over 4000 messages none of you have a
life.

Lets look at the facts, there's the time it takes to read and respond to the
vast majority of post that you do, the time it takes to play EverQuest,
leads me to believe you are children.  There's no time for you to maintain a
job.  No time for a social life.

I came to newsgroups for one reason.  To find information on upcoming
changes in EverQuest because the EverQuest home page message board was
temporarily disabled.   I find it humorous the message board was disabled
because there were so many useless postings that within a matter of minutes
any suggestions that might be beneficial were buried pages behind and never
read.  I see where the people causing the heavy traffic have gone.

 oh I almost forgot Curve, when is it that you work?  Looking through
numerous postings you've made and the times they were made.  I just can't
fit 8 hours in.  Looks more like a school schedule or a part time job maybe
flipping burgers.
