Well, it is , but its a persistent game - I want to have fun with
my friends and to a degree some of that is feeling that they're not
carrying me, that I'm pulling my weight and that my contributions
are meaningful and helpful.

Thus when I begin to fall behind in some areas I am willing to
suffer some short term boredom for continuing long term pleasure ;)

Besides, when I find a tailor who can succeed with the verdamnt
tigerraptor I'll feel all spiffy and special and warm inside as
I wear it ;-)

hee,

Sui (hunted velketors lots, found it like a return to the old days
guk, hated it, left - actually have more fun being a loon with
orcs way to far beneath me than in a superefficient pickup xp
grind group of silent exp mongers. At least the low levels I help
tend to chatter with excitement ;) )

But its very boring in *comparison* to being a loon with my friends
of the last year or so exploring undercamped and underutilised zones
and trembling at every corner.

Oh, and the Othmir. they're fun too ;)

What, its not a good advertisment for baseball if you have abad
game and leave the field bitching about how much you hate the
stupid fucking sport?

But you go back again and again dont you? Thats the advertisment ;) And
when things fall into alignment and you exceed your usual limitations
and you gibber wildly about the expertise and skill required (its not
a mindless camp/sport/pasttime NOW is it?) thats the advertisment ;)
