I used to bind on that island between Qeynos and Erudin that has a lot of
wisps.  While waiting for a res after raid wipe outs, I'd pass the time
killing wisps.

(Right now, though, I'm bound near Gornit, so I can easily pop in there and
kill him for cash.  I noticed last weekend, when we had a wipe, that the
area near Gornit is a *lot* more scary when you are a naked Wizard with no
spells memmed than when you are a fully clothed and jbooted Wizard with a
snare and several nukes ready.  I think it is time to move my bind point
again... :-))
