The drum is secondary but you can't have anything in your primary for it 
to equip.  Same thing with storebought mandolins.  Now, if you are a 
vahshir, there's some nice instruments you can get from the quests. 
Check out eqtraders.com quests page for the vahshir bard quests or if 
you aren't vahshir look up armor quest for your race, I assume you have 
next to nothing for armor and those are actually pretty good.
