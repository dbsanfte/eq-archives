}>What EQ seems to think though as that any sort of law against
}>discrimination is a "special right".  I seriously doubt he has ever
}>read the text of any law, and has yet to show he is basing his opinion
}>on anything other than a knee-jerk reaction to his pet "axis of evil"-
}>anything or anyone he can label as PC.
}Actually, I have read the laws quite extensively.
}And you are partially correct.
}I *do* believe anti-discrimination laws as they pertain to gay people
}is special treatment.

So you believe their group should be singled out and made exempt from the 
protection of the laws?  Sort of like the Knight initiative does.

}If homosexuals can have anti-discrimination laws, why not peopl in the
}Swing Lifestyle?? Why can't it be against the law to discriminate
}against them?
}But why stop there?
}Let's have anti-discrimination laws that protect bi-sexual people.  

I thought you said you read those laws.  Is there some part of the term 
"sexual orientation" you were unclear on?  Unless you've latched on to 
some particular local law that I am unaware of, and which will probably be 
declared unconstitutional.

}Or hell, let's get away from sex all together, and make up some
}anti-discrimination laws against blondes....

Actually, I'd oppose that.  Then we'd have to rewrite all the blonde 
jokes.

}People are people.  Whether they be gay, bi, blonde or whatever.
}People are people and it SHOULD be wrong to discriminate against
}ANYONE...  For ANY reason...

Yes, it should.  Do you realize that this is a very Politically Correct 
argument that you are making?

}So, explain to me why you support the SELECTIVE protection of certain
}groups under the law??

Well, I don't.  

}By supporting that, it is YOU who supports bigotry and prejudice.

Good thing I don't support it then.

}I stand for EQUAL treatment under the law for EVERYONE..

What an unusual concept.  Where do you think this is, America?

}You stand for UNEQUAL treatment.  Preferential treatment.  Unfair
}treatment.

Again, I wonder where you get this from Blacksheep's posts?  Reading is 
Fundamental.
