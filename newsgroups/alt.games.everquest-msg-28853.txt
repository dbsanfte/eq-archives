Nope, just as irritating to have someone harassing you other players in the
zone as having someone constantly spaming "NE1 give me free stuff". You
don't have to respect his camp anymore then you have to give a begger free
stuff, but look at the hundreds of posts in the newsgroup saying how
irritating beggers are.

It is about how you want to spend your free time enjoying yourself. Most
people don't find it enjoyable to have jerks pestering them one way or
another.
