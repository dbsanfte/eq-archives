This is true. But if the platinum and items weren't lost the company
in question should just let it drop. Having someone back out of a deal
shouldn't be an uncommon occurance to them. The only reason this thing
would even be an issue is if it was done to swindle them out of access
to items.

Sure they do.. but they also provide means for a user of an account to
both access and trade the items which they own with other players. If
a user gets swindled out of that access.. whether or not it is or
isn't against the EULA... it is still a crime. And a good case could
be made if done over the internet its wire fraud.

>Sony's EULA expressly says you do not own it.

And? They still give you access to the items. Lets look at the old
mining town. The mining town used to be own completely by the
corporation that built it and employees would then live there. Does
that mean that if someone came buy and offered me $500 for a TV I
bought with my earnings in the mine, and then refused to pay while
still taking the TV, that this doesn't constitute a crime? After all..
it was on company property, and in all probability the TV was bought
at a company store.

Personally.. if you ask me the corporations that run MMORPG's wield
wayyyyy too much autonomous control over the game world. As such you
have a lot of situations where you are basically performing work and
generating items for that company at not only no charge, but for a
charge. Laugh if you will... but the players should really unionize.
After all, if the guild summit comes about because some guilds leave,
imagine what would happen if a user base struck enmass. SOE needs us
much more than we need them for the world to work. Without them we go
do something else, without us they go out of business. Simply putting
all the benefit on SOE's side because they own the hardware is
ridiculous.

Unless of course you like being used and abused... if so, no need to
worry about the above paragraph.

And my point is if you choose to sell anything in that locker.. and
someone agrees to pay you and receives control of the items but
doesn't give the funds... that is fraud. You could have a point that
it isn't theft, but it should certainly be fraud. Its fraud on the
part of the sellee if he can't deliver the item yet takes the
funds(hence the brooklyn bridge scenario), why would it be different
if he delivers the item but doesn't receive the funds?

I still say.. if you want to fix that shit... unionize. A player
strike simply consists of shutting down their accounts until changes
are made. It would take one or two months tops for SOE to play ball.
The funny part is we actually would save money in a strike. Normally
strikes are determental to the strikee, but in this case you save
$12.95 a month per account :>.
