By points, as he suggests.  Merit is based on the opinions of guild 
leaders as to your value to the guild.  Need is based on the opinions of 
the guild leaders as to the value of the equipment on each person.

Points, on the other hand, are normally awarded for showing up, not 
based on your value or the value of your gear, and are spent by the 
player in a fair and equal way, so the opinions of guild leaders aren't 
involved.

While I personally dislike points systems and would prefer a random 
system of some kind, I don't have any trouble seeing where some would 
prefer points, in fact almost all high end guilds use a points system at 
least in part; points systems run well are nearly as fast as random, and 
reward people for showing up on raids where they know for sure nothing 
for them can possibly drop; this is the essential problem with a random 
system; it rewards people who only show up where it might benefit them.
