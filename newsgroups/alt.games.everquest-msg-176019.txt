I've seen the geforce 4 (ti4600 128mb) working and it's an impressive card
and as mentioned, the driver support from Nvidia is without issues.

I run the ATI 9700pro 128mb after seeing a friends, it simply blew me away,
so my new machine was ordered with this inside. ATI do have a questionable
level of support for drivers, but from experience, as long as the card has
been around for a month or two, then drivers don't seem to be a problem.
