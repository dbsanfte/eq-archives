No.  What I said - or what I meant to say - was that you can't always solve 
arguments by quoting from dictionaries.  I've been around Usenet long 
enough to know that dictionary-based quibbles rarely resolve anything.

What I said was that you and I both know what 'rogue' means in its everyday 
context, and I think that general interpretation was covered by both your 
dictionary quotes and my original comment - namely that a rogue can be 
taken to mean something outside the mainstream.

Accepted.  As I've said, my anti-rogue rant was probably due to the 
frustration which comes from suddenly being over level 10 and realising 
just how much time I'm going to have to devote to this game to make any 
real progress.  For what it's worth, it's still my favourite class.  My 
ranger might be able to track and my warrior might be able to dish out more 
damage - but I bet neither of them could walk from Freeport to Qeynos at 
level 5 without getting attacked by something somewhere along the line.

What say we leave it at that?  :o)
