Heyas

I just wondered - when you cancel your EQ account, does it not 'activate'
until the period you have already paid for has been reached? Main reason I
ask is that they've only just took payment for the next 3 months, so if I'd
lose that time by cancelling now I may as well wait a while to cancel.

Thanks in advance!! :)
