A rogue would have to mitigate damage very well indeed to out
tank a shaman, which probably has more HP, more regen, but far
more importantly, which can happily spend the entire fight with
Stoicism running.. and probably will even if he's not tanking,
because he's running Canni constantly.

I guess you -might- be including stoicism in your "sacrificing
too much damage" consideration, but I thought you were referring
merely to the 15% more damage due to avoiding dodge, parry,
riposte and stuns plus the substantial BS damage you'd lose from
being in front of the mob.

I'd want you to take as little damage as you can manage,
actually, although you might run too much aggro for the shaman to
keep the mob's attention; evade will let you get the Backstabs in
of course, but won't save you from taking half the damage the mob
does nor losing half that other 15% damage you'd get if you could
stay in position the whole fight.

I'd suggest Backstab evade melee till BS refresh, repeat, unless
the shaman's HP pool is getting dangerously low and you really
want to take some of the heat.

I've not actually tried this, mind you, closest I've come was my
cleric tanking for a ranger buddy; the ranger took far more
damage from the mob than my cleric did (I had several levels and
a lot better gear advantage on him) but my cleric had to work
like a dog in order to keep aggro.  Nice thing was when cleric
needed a heal, it was simple to STOP stunning and back up,
letting the root and blind and mad ranger aggro take over.

Thats, plus experience as a shaman up to 52 is most of what I'm
basing this on; perhaps at higher levels a rogue mitigates damage
so much better than a shaman that sharing the hits is more
practical.

Come to think of it, my bard used to duo with a rogue on
occaision who would do all the tanking except for the hit or two
the mob would lay out during his evade/BS trick; of course a bard
is even worse at tanking than a rogue, and there's no healing as
such in that duo at all, so getting both of us damaged was a
decent enough plan
