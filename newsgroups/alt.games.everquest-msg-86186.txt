This zone really keeps you on your toes! Lots of wandering MOBs and green
aggros like you mentioned.  I found a "safe spot" to farm loot off highland
kobold camp #2 (no one is ever in this zone anymore).  No wandering MOBs.
You really just need to follow the MOB patterns and try to find a vacant
area.
