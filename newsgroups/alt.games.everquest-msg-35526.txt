Win2k?  Either way, it sorta sounds like you were opening programs in the
background...perhaps hit the Windows key, followed by (at some point) P for
Programs then navigated to some other program (Half Life perhaps), and that
program took control.

www.download.com   Do a search on "winkey" and download WinKey Killer.
Simple program to run.  Execute it once, disable the Windows key.  Execute
it again, re-enables.

Here's a direct link that'll probably wrap (so doing the search may be
faster):
