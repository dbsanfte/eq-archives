One of my favorite zones for the 20s these days is the much maligned
Lake of Ill Omen.  It has a "standard" 75 ZEM these days, but it is
never crowded and always has lots of mobs.  The Paladin will be able
to sell off any vendor trash you loot to Nubs at the "mill", basicly
you won't have to leave except to get food/drink.  The trip there
can be tricky, more so without invis, but it is very doable (SoW
would help) as long as you are patient and alert (if the Necro is
going thru FV PoK book he will need to invis to avoid the wandering
guard that patrols the caves where the book is).
