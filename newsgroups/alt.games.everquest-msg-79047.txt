Dunno... I'm a druid, but I never group. Yeah, so why's she posting?????
Just to say "I dunno". ;) Hey, I like my druid enough that *I* would group
with her. Druids are a kick-ass class, and she is, by FAR, my favorite,
though enchanter comes close as 2nd, mage as 3rd... bard as 4th... just
rolled up a ranger, so I dunno about him. (yeah, Legolas's double, only male
character I have!)
