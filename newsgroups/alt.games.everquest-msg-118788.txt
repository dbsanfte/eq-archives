You realize, of course, that the people who feel too much of a kinship
to cattle to eat them are a minority as well...

No, I wasn't saying "polluting the water is okay", I was saying that
if these people were so true to their convictions they would either
use a well-maintained boat that doesn't leak oil/feul at the very
least or use a sail/row boat that doesn't even burn the feul produced
by the oil platform their protesting.

What a posative and nurturing attitude you have toward your "kin"...

Maybe in your mind, but the truth is, in the grand scheme of things,
it does not make the world a "better place" to refuse to eat meat.
It's no less "right" for a human to eat beef than it is for a lion to
eat a gazelle. Or, if you want an example of an animal that can live
perfectly well on plants, for a racoon to eat fish.
