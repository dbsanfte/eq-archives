What people told me how to do here, and I have a Hot Key set-up for it is 
this:

/corpse
/corpse
/corpse
/say Just taking out the dead bodies

By mashing this Hot Key, ( I have it listed as DRAG ), I can drag a corpse 
even when SOWed and not have to go back because I out-ran it.
The line at the end is just a funny.  Different toons say different things.

I know this works as I am a Master, (skill lvl 252) of death........mine.
