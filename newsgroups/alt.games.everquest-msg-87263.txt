If you don't mind a tedious solo-farm... try the Bandit sash quest in
Qeynos... Karana bandits won't agro on you at 23, unless you're medding...
it's 'goody' faction (always helpful to a Necro)... and you can make around
20-30pp per hour or so, depending on drop rates (only human bandits drop the
sashes... not barbs/wizzies or druids)

Teach yourself to fletch up to 190-202 (Ceramic vaned arrows sell back to
merchants at above cost)... you'll only make about 10-15pp per hour and ruin
your mouse... but it's risk-free money from a skill your Warr should
practice anyways ;o)

If you want EXP while you earn...
Send the Warrior to LOIO and get in a group.
Aviak city in SK (find an Avo group for bronze/FS weapons and the
occaisional low-level gem)
Cazic for FS weapons (might be hard to stay there, depending on Ogguk
faction for selling)
