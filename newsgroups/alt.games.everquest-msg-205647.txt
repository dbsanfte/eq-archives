I'm so out of date. I feel like the old fogey sitting in the rocking
chair next to the barber shop mumbling to myself about days gone by
while glaring suspiciously at strangers passing by, clutching my cane
threateningly, not knowing in my growing senility that they're the
same people who have been walking by me for the last thirty years or
more.

Remember when the only thing useful you could make with blacksmithing
was banded armor?
