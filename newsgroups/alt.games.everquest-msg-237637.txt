Under options, click off environmental sounds. This removes the
annoying, overloud, repetitive sounds like crickets, the horn loop in
HoH and almost all annoying sounds except in LDoN dungeons and the new
Gates zones, where it seems the programmers forgot to flag the sounds as
environmental. Either that or just play with the sound off until SOE
finds someone to do the sound in their game who isn't deaf as a post.
