Heh, the mobs hit often enough that I usually need a few CHeals over
the course of a fight.  And the mana isn't much.  The hammer, meanwhile,
costs no mana, though it does "cost a slot" because I cast it using
Ornate leggings.  Still, at my level, Ornate isn't bad gear, so I don't
mind that "price".

When the cleric duos with my druid it gets even weirder.  The strategy
I often use is to pile on my best 3 dots, then have both characters sit
on their horses (well, one horse and one pony :) while the mob beats on
the druid's damage shields and the cleric keeps her alive.  As long as
the druid resists actually meleeing, she gets sitting mana regen.  (Hm,
I think I even got the idea from a thread here a while back, discussing
some other class -- necros? -- using a similar technique.)  The reverse
DS certainly is small but still noticeable on top of the druid's two DS
(self-only plus general), and both the hammer and the druid's pet can
add their modest damage.  If I have trouble keeping up with the healing
the druid can switch to kiting and the two pets plus dots continue their
work, of course.

Sure, I tend to use those even if the cleric is mostly just sitting back
and healing.  But sending him into melee does seem to noticeably speed
up the kills.  I can't do it continuously because of the lost mana regen,
but I get some of that back because I don't need as much healing.
I suppose it's possible that I'd do even better just nuking (which drops
me even further behind on mana, though), but as you say, I don't want
to spend all my time comparing numbers, I just want to play. :)
