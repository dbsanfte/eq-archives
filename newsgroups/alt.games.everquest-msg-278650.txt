Not entirely true, other than at the very lowest levels, Clerics always 
have the heal spells available before the other priest classes.  
Basically, the other priest classes are almost as good as clerics at 
certain levels.  Even when clerics and the other priests have the same 
heal spell, it's not really the same, clerics heal more hp with the same 
spell.  The other two priests are almost as good as clerics at some 
levels prior to 39, and never really catch up again after that.  Shaman 
have the huge advantage of being able to slow in addition to heal, thus 
significantly increasing the effectiveness of their healing ability, 
Druids get heal spells that fall in between shaman and cleric heal 
spells.  The low level slows however are not a huge slow percentage.  I 
can tell you that it was always a serious struggle for me to heal groups 
during the last 4 or so levels that I had any given heal spell.  Clerics 
got the new heal spells at the right level to be effective healers for 
their level, whereas druids and shaman got them a few levels too late.

Minor Healing - Level 1 all priest classes
Light Healing - Level 5 Cleric, Level 9 Shaman/Druid
Healing - Level 14 Cleric, Level 19 Shaman/Druid
Celestial Remedy - Level 19 Cleric
Greater Healing - Level 24 Cleric, Level 29 Shaman/Druid
Superior Healing - Level 34 Cleric, Level 39 Shaman/Druid
Complete Heal - Level 39 Cleric
