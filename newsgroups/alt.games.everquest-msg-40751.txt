Well, rogues don't tend to solo much ;)

Evade's large advantage is that there is NOTHING it doesn't work on. Magic
immune mobs can still be evaded, frenzied mobs can be evaded, evade works
at any proximity, and still allows the rogue to hit for full power. Still,
I gave the 4 rating to warriors, and paladins *do* have more options. Would
a 6 be fair?

Cruddy channeling, and more likely to be hit during the attempt for more
interrupts.

6 here? Seems a bit high.

The combination of hp, ac, and also the emergency LoH when dragging a body.

Too high?

Hmm, quite the opposite of the feedback I've gotten speaking to paladins. I
guess with DW helm healing, they can cut their downtime down quite a bit,
but the lack of sustainable (ie: melee) offense that paladins have makes
their fights drag on longer than is practical for easy soloing.

Err, well, I would have hoped from the context of other epics (rogue and
bard in particular, with their attached comments) that the way the rating
worked would be self-explanatory...I can tidy up the category explanation.
Low numbers are never desirable.
