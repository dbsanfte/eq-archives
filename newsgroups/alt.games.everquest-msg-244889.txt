And during that couple hours when you are waiting for stuff to break
and raid you tell groups to stay guild-only, or in areas where they
don't get tied up in stuff you can't drop on a moment's notice.

The exact time you tell people to stay fluid in what they are doing.

Your timer for the mob gets set to the time of last kill, especially
if you were the ones that brought it down. You aren't going to try to
determine a spawn time based on a patch 3 weeks ago.

All you need is a range down to several hours. Those several hours are
the... DONT TAKE LDON'S time.

Per that system, any xp'ing you want to get in between 4pm-9pm, should
not be an LDoN, unless the guild has called an xp night. Either do
them after, or if that's the only time you can play, not at all on
raid nights. Stick to straight xp spots that can be dropped if
something comes up. You lose some flexibility as a result of being
able to raid harder targets for better gear, most people don't have an
issue and some will never learn.

There still aren't many targets that can be in and out in 45 minutes.
Especially as you start to reach high-tier PoP mobs/rings where you
have a lot of piggy issues and what not. I would say that the time to
establish you are on the mob is measured in minutes. If you can
accomplish that, you have as much time as you desire to bring it down.

I know the issues, but usually more times than not.. unless it is in
an open area with multiple pull points, say AoW, tormax, etc.. if a
guild is allready there and on the way.. those guilds don't try to
race it and look for other targets. And if both guilds formed close..
often the officers come to an agreement before things get too heated
unless, as you said, you have a guild full of pricks and then you have
all sorts of GM Tom-foolery. Some of the funniest sights I've ever
seen came from two guilds fighting over an open area spawn. Seeing AoW
go running past a guide towards the EW zoneline, and then camping the
zone in comes to mind.
