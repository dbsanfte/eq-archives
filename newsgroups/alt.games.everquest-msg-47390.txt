Yes. You are limited to the original allowable ones in verants HUGE
testeq news text file but you have a choice of like 3 different facets
on most char race combos at 10. Basically you compare the ones for
your race with your diety or whatever to get the ones you can be. At
10 you can solidify your choice but its usually similar like 3 types
of neutral or evil or good. 

On my dark elf cleric I typed /alignment at 10 and it showed I could 
be which ever way they crossed over.. I think like DE OE and something
else, but all evil.

It then says to change, type this again followed by a number. It
listed DE as one, OE as 2, etc or something. So after 10 I typed
/alignment, read that, then typed /alignment 2  and was ordered evil.
You can only do that once. 

I think on the barb shaman now at level 6 I typed it and it shows it
as being ON (order neutral) but I think at 10 I'll have a choice of
that, Neutral and something else. So I would type /alignment and which
ever number full Neutral was. 

Here is an example of the race dwarves I just did looking at the text
file:

Dwarves can be 
(ON - N/NG)

Brell can be:
(N/ON - NG/OG - DN/DG)

Cleric can be:
(ANY)

Paladin can be:
(OG - NG)

Rogue can be:
(DN/N - DG/DE/NG/NE)

Warrior can be:
(ANY)

So, lets say you have a Dwarf brell cleric (all have to be brell I
think) and a dwarf brell paladin (ditto) The cleric would start as
something but at 10 have the choice of being:

N ON NG (taking where brell and dwarf overlap)


The paladin would have the choice of this at 10:

NG  (only choice for a dwarf pally I guess.. so no choice, only
overlap of dwarf, brell, pally) Neutral good is still "good."

lets say you toss a dwarf rogue into the group

N NG  are his choices at 10.


Warrior tags along and his choices at 10 are:

ON N NG


So lets say the cleric, warrior and rogue all go just "N"(neutral)
because they can. The paladin goes NG since that is his only choice.

The three N characters can group with anyone but if grouped with the
paladin could have no evil in the group I guess (or at least the
paladin could cast nothing for the evil, receive no casting from it
and apparently not lay hands on it?)

If just in a group with each other, no one gets a minus or plus to XP
since the three are just "N" which can group with anyone and gives no
minus or plus grouping bonus.
