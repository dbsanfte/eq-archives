Disagree all you like, won't change a thing.  The loot is in the
game, on the ground, and the _former_ owner is not.  Pretty damned
open and shut.

Hmm, most of the player community seems to believe that I should feel
obliged to respect a camp, and social obligations are no less real
than legal ones.  At the same time, just how many people do you believe
will respect your camp if you log between spawns?  I submit that you
will be subjected to the same ridicule as the whiner who loses the
gear he drops in a high traffic area.

You still haven't shown his action to be an act of theft (hard to

do when it's not), and I find your accusation a good deal more
reprehensible than his act.  So to turn your last bit around, I
reserve the right to consider you... hmm, don't think I'll go there.
