Damage is not the only stat on a weapon.  Damage and delay are both
important.  A weapon that does 5 damage with a 10 delay would be
incredible.  A weapon that does 50 damage with a 1000 delay would
be unusable.  You never get a damage bonus, so the straight ratio is
the important thing to look at, a 5/10 weapon would be, for you, about
the same as a 50/100... although you'd doubtless have your so called
friends come over to your house late one night and shoot you in the head
if you took the 5/10 when a melee could have had it.

At levels under 10 all players are fighters.  Its in between 10 and 20 that
you start to find your true role, as melee classes start doing significantly

more and taking less damage, while casters spells start changing the
nature of the fight more and more.

Players in your level range often don't know their role, or yours, or
how groups work.  They often don't understand simple concepts,
like the need for mana to heal with... if they pull a red mob and beat
it with you healing, and then pull that same mob again with you OOM,
they die... and they look -so- surprised!

You are, on the other hand, likely burning too much mana.  Just because
your role is healing doesn't mean you should be going OOM on a regular
basis doing so.  If you find yourself forced to spend that much mana each
pull, the whole group either needs to adjust tactics or find easier prey.
You will be spending far too long medding if you keep it up, noone likes
doing just one fight every ten minutes.  You are also not prepared for
accidents; if it takes all your mana while things are going well, what
happens
when things go wrong?

Foraging.  One of the slowest skills to raise, and the most annoying, as a
tailor (and as a druid) you are going to need this as high as you can get
it.

As for conjugation, just try repeated conjugal visits.  Practicing an
enjoyable
skill like this can hardly be considered onerous.
