What baby? The ability to solo as a warrior? Is *that* what we're trying 
to preserve? 

On the one hand: EQ is about grouping...  and if you don't have a 
regular group maybe making a warrior on a special rules server like this 
is a bad idea... just as it is on a 'zek.

On the other hand I agree with you; warriors suck to solo, especially in 
an environment like the one proposed. And gear upgrades are difficult to 
get and absolutely crucial... casters can at least farm greens and buy 
the majority of their spells up into the mid game and somewhat beyond.

I think its reasonable that on a no drop server their should be higher 
drop rates. Given how much more loot is going to rot it only seems fair 
that more should come into the game faster. This should alleviate the 
gear problem somewhat.

Additionally we have LDoN (grouping required) but the gear is decent 
level appropriate stuff for a 40+ even at the 60-150pt mark.

I guess the question is what should a warrior expect to be wearing at 
20th on the server? Rawhide/Bronze/BlackAlloy/NewbieQuest/Netherbian 
Chitin/

And what about 40? Crafted/LDoN 60pt plate/twilight (definately need a 
drop rate boost)

-----------

Further, when all is said and done, this is an optional alt rules 
server. If the warrior wannabe feels he's getting the shaft and doens't 
like the environment... he can always play elsewhere. I think that alone 
keeps the 'baby' safe and sound.
