I don't think you can automate eating.  Sony allows automation of a
restricted number of things so that we don't end up with robot
players.

You can automate spell casting (to a degree). melee, and special
skills such as forage or sense heading.

Also I don't think there's any way to tie mouse clicks to anything, as
the mouse is already overloaded with a lot of the interface (con,
pick-up, use, drop, transfer, loot, etc.).  So the automation comes
from the "hot buttons" only, and you can tie them to specific keys if
you wish.  By default, the hot buttons are tied to the number keys
(not the numeric pad ones).

Also, you shouldn't need to eat all the time... you autoeat the stuff
in your packs naturally.
