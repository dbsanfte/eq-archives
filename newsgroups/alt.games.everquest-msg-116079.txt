There are only two rules for raiding:
1) Listen & follow instructions
2) DO NOT SAY ANYTHING THAT ANYONE COULD EVER CONSIDER A WHINE.  No
bitching, no moaning, no sarcastic remarks, no self-deprecatory jokes, no
suggesting that maybe you guys aren't good enough for the zone, no
demoralizing comments.  No one likes a whiner, you aren't fooling anyone,
and you're not helping.

Attitude accounts for a hell of a lot when it comes to a successful raid.

Anyway, Fear specific, critters LOVE to pound on sitters.  If "clerics camp"
is called, hit DA/DB, /q, and pray.
