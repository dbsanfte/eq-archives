I think I had a similar problem multiple times when pressing
"ESC" to exit a vendors trade window and then Right-Clicking
to strafe to the next vendor right away.
Happened to me about 5 times in Thurgadin, though not
since I switched to waiting a sec after leaving the vendor window
and then carefully strafing sideways.
It might have been on double right-clicks only as it didn't happen
most of the time...
