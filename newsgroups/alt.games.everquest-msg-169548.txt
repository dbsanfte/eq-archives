Umm.

Run 3.

Almost as fast as JBoots, always and forever (unless snared) for the rest of
your life, indoors or outdoors, never wears off, faster than almost every mob,
fast enough to keep up over short distances with anyone but a bard (or cheetah
but who uses that for travelling)

I can't think of a class that shouldn't spend points one thru 3 on run run run.
