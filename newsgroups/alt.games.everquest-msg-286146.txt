I dared a venture into the TBS zones after getting the Anniversary
pack.  Fell off the boat while running around right after zoning in to
TBS, spent the next hour cautiosly swimming around, trying not to
aggro the various very red mobs, thanking Cazic for having FD.
Eventually I stumbled upon the zone in to Catta. Spent another few
hours just wandering about, talking to NPC's and being told I was not
strong enough.
Didn't see very many PC's, though.

Happily, I don't see a lot of PLing in Acrylia, but it does seem to
run rampant in Draniks Scar.  I suppose the draw of the pre-existing
augs + HZ augs is strong.

My understanding is not only is it just added eye-candy for the horse,
it also only affects bridled horses, and not knight horses.  Anyone
know for certain?
