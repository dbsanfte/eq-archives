General rule is 5 x (level + 1)... defense offense is exception at 5 x
level... and some classes get exceptions... for example monks get (level +
1) x 7 for Dual Wield (i think that's the equation for Monks Dual wield
anyways)

and those equations work up to the skill cap levels... my enc dodge caps at
75... cant get it past that... some skills cap out at 200 until level 50...
level 51 ya get a boost (Example spell skills, meditate... I play a caster
as main so don't know about melee skill caps post 50)

hope I don't confuse things... feel free to go to http://eq.castersrealm.com
and read up on skill caps and related issues there

good luck
