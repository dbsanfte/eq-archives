Yes, and we trained Osama too.  Why do you think the FBI's "most wanted"

My personal opinion is that there was plenty of justification for invading
Iraq.

My personal opinion is that even if Iraq had stacks of ICBMs sitting around
just waiting for the uranium processing to complete, *that* wouldn't be
justification for invading Iraq.  What business is it of ours who has what
weapons?  What gives us the right to decide for a "sovereign" nation what
weapons they are allowed to possess?

However, they had already lost a war, and had sanctions imposed, and failed
to live up to those sanctions.  Bush has made many mistakes, but the actual
invasion of Iraq wasn't one of them.  The timing, perhaps, which only time
will tell.

We didn't invade Iraq for "human rights" reasons.  Hell, we *can't* or we'd
be forced to publicly turn a blind eye on some countries (China in
particular) where we would have absolutely no hope of winning a war.  Right
now we ignore it everywhere.  It's a good policy when you have little
alternative.

The reasons have been pointed out multiples times.  They had requirements to
live up to, imposed by the UN no less, and they refused to live up to them. 
Not just one of them, all of them.  The UN should have formed a force and
removed Sadaam from power before Bush ever became president.

Point to an accomplishment, beyond just not increasing the debt *as much*,
beyond teaching kindergarten students the word "blowjob"...   He tried to
push through a socialized health care system.  He failed.  Off the top of my
head, I can't think of anything else major that he even tried to accomplish.

Bush started an unpopular war, along with many presidents in the past. 
There is no "defiling" in that.

Exactly.  He accelerated the inevitable.  Who can say whether that prevented
something truly terrible?  Personally, I don't think it did, but I also
think that removing the threat of it happening as soon as possible was a
good idea.  We didn't need a replay of the Cuban missile crisis (which was
probably way overblown, but that was before my time).

No, that's just a statement.  Getting America involved in unpopular wars is
a presidential pasttime enjoyed by many presidents in the past, some of them
considered "great men" in the history books.

I haven't heard substance from either.  =)

So you prefer wishy washy but with a good heart?  Eh, kind of a Hobson's

If a credit card company called everyone in America and offered everyone a
$300 credit card, no payments due until the next democrat is elected
president, there would never be another democrat elected president.  Ever.
