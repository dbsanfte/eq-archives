Ummm, server login queues are going on for the 20 most popular (ie,
populated) servers.  They are penalizing the people who pre-ordered and
were then shoe-horned onto the few opened servers (something similar
happened in EQ2, but there hasn't been login queues implemented to
alleviate any problems).  There are people who still have client
crashes approximately once an hour and then have to wait in the queue
to get in again.  They added the queues because their server code
couldn't handle all the people on those servers.  Try logging into one
of them during primetime... it is so much fun it leads to newsgroup
trolling while waiting to get in the game ;)

Oh, and check out something other than the cesspool that is the
Blizzard forums.  Slashdot has another article on how Blizzard isn't
shipping any more boxes until they figure out how to fix their mess.
There is a link in there to people complaining about all the problems
they've had.
