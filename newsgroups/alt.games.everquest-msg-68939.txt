I've been playing pretty much exclusively in Luclin since I got it.
I'm not really doing much level-appropriate hunting; instead I've done
a LOT of exploring, and have been killing newbie mobs in ST for
testing tailoring ingredients.

I'm glad to say that with all models turned on and high texture
resolution, the game is quite playable at 1024x768. It's a little
choppy in city zones, but I'm confident that will be resolved before
long.
