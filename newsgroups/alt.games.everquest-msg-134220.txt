We did have some civil wars (revolutions) actually. I think the monarchy was
great for our country when we were growing but it's outdated now and it's
time we moved forwards from where we are atm. Something I hate is when
people compare the UK to the USA, as a combined group of countries we are
still smaller than many US states and have little in the way of natural
resources to drill or mine so we are not going to be the super power we once
were when we had access to all the colonies etc.

I think what we achieve considering all these factors is pretty impressive
and we manage to stick to the Kyoto protocol and other world agreements,
making sacrifices for the greater good. We dropped the third world debt to
our country for instance. How many other countries would do that? For such a
powerful nation I think America's lone gunner, selfish attitude to the world
is shameful and without excuse but there you go, Doane will come back with
some crap so what's the point? ;P
