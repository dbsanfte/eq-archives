Just shooting from the hip here, but I would guess that either your dhcp
server is not issuing enough ip addresses to your various computers or you
have a computer configured to receive the same static ip address as another
computer or the router itself.

The reason this problem is occurs so often when playing everquest is that it
reconnects to your computer everytime you change zones.
