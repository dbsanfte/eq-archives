Back when the official EQ forums were less restricted than
they are now, Verant started a thread asking players what
they thought of such a change, *but* it was described in
a way that would have (intentionally) made multi-questing
impossible.  The proposal was that quest NPCs would reject
any "Give" transaction that didn't contain *all* the required
quest items the NPC wanted.

I'd appreciate it if players could hunt down a post-patch "modified"
quest NPC, and try to multi-quest with it to see if MQ'ing is still
possible or not.
