That's why I encouraged someone to rebuild it from source.  :)   I wrote a
virus checker for the Amiga years ago and always released source for it as
well, just so people would know that it wasn't compromised.  I should set
MapX up on SourceForge or something.

I can understand being careful.. Hopefully someone (that frequents this
group - otherwise it could simply be me under an alias) will report back
that it's ok.

I never heard of .MAP files either - that's why, when I found a bunch of
them, I had to write a viewer to see what they were.  Whoever made them did
a really good job on a lot of them.
