This is a well stated piece, and by itself, it has many components
that are near and dear to my heart, and so I admire it, and hope you
are consistant with it.  I'm a stickler at times for "symantics", 
since it's SO easy for a thought to take on a *completly* different
meaning and twist just based on ones choice of words. (and I really
think that's was EQ's point was)
