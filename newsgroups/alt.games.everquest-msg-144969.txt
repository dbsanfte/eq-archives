What I want to know is:  where are the Half-Elf Shadowknights?  Not
only do Half-Elves have stupid stats for a wis-caster, but they're
generally treated poorly by the Humans and Elves they live among.
So why is it that there aren't at least some of them who turned to
the dark side and set about repaying all those goody-goody bullies
who teased them so mercilessly back in the third grade?  lol.
