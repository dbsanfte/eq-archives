It's not that I have a problem with a warrior pulling in LDoN, I love
tank-mez groups. But seriously, if you're group leader and want to
pull then why invite a bard?  

I will say that if you lost by 10 or 15 minutes, a bard pulling almost
certainly would have won it for you. Just shaving 15 seconds off of
every pull probably would have made the difference and that's easy to
do when a bard can stack up the mobs for killing. It's gonna take you
a certain amount of time in between kills to run off and pull the next
set of mobs. 

That's all hindsight though, I just wanted to point out that I think
it's perfectly normal to have a bard wanting to pull and if you do
have a motivated bard that wants to, why not let him?

Hell, we all do it. I'll bitch in a chat channel if I have a
group(member) that just isn't working out. That bard (I'm guessing)
bitched in guildsay. You came here to bitch <g>. Doesn't excuse
someone from his guild sending you a tell, I'll grant you that that's
pretty strange. I wouldn't read too much into it though, it sounds
more like just a misunderstanding than anything else.
