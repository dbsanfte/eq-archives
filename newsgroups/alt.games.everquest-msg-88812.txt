These 2 would be very powerful. Especially using the fear kiting
technique. Or even letting the Pet tank with the druid damage sheilding
and healing the pet.

Their dot spells stack. Sow for speed and emergencies. Teleports
to remote locations and travel. Necro can life tap and pump the
druids mana up. Druid can regen/heal the necro and buff the pet. Druid
can track for rare spawns.
