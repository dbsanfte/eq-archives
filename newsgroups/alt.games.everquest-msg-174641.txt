I love the new interface - but some things about it are annoying. The
fading windows are really annoying. I set the fade level to 100%, but
still some windows, like container windows still fade occasionally.
Also - that damn menu that pops up sometimes when you right click
something drives me batty. Is there a way to turn that damn menu off?
Also, is there a way to set default for every character, in an ini
file perhaps? Everytime I start a new alt, it begins with the default
options.
