OK so the patches some times go wrong, but hey they do get round to fixing
them, the game keeps growing, more quest are added, items, zones, races etc
etc.

IMHO this is one of the bext online games out there, and the fact that its
growing all the time and still being developed is a added bonus.

I run it on a amd 1.1 128 of mem a a 16meg tnt card. Sure I have to turn the
texture quality down and the clip rate down a tad too. But its still very
playable on my out of date setup. When bugs creep in they be fixed fairly
soon, and nearly all the people I have seen moaning just havent upgraded
their DirectX or gfx drivers to directx8 compatable ones.

In short if ya dont like it, stop playing it :) And no Im not porting you
too BB for free and giving wolf form and buffs when we get there... :-p
