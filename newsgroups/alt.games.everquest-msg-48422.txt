Hi,

As I said I'm brand new to EQ and I've attempted to play 3 separate
characters.  I managed to find the guy who trains you and figured out how to
arm myself (and even how to turn auto attack on).  I went out into the
newbie area and got my butt kicked.  After much dying and recovery, I
managed to scrape myself to lvl 2.  Is it supposed to be this hard?  What am
I doing wrong?  Where can I get some cash? (Every time I die every copper
piece disappears and I'm out of luck.)

It's getting extremely frustrating...please help.
