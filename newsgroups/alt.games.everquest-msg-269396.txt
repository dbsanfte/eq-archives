Hmmm... I agree at the super low levels that's a bit high. But even in 
my mid teens I'd fight for 15-20 seconds and then regen for 2 minutes. 
(~15 mana per tic regen for 20 tics is only 300 mana... I'd easily burn 
that in an 18 second solo fight in my teens)

I was only guessing at your eq2 kill rate. But it sounds like you'd be 
able to kill 150+ mobs in the amount of time it takes to kill 60 in EQ1? 
Still leaves you a long way short of matching your EQ1 progress... but 
its not quite the picture you originally painted.

That a good point that was never clarified: Is that level progression 
assumed or real? Do you perhaps need only 400 yellows at 43 in EQ2 too? 
Or do you have reason to beleive that at 43 you'll need 800 or 1600 
yellows to progress?

Fair enough. Is this something you'd expect to be corrected in 2 
expansions or perhaps, as some others have mentioned a few patches? Most 
new release MMOGs are light on content particularly when compared to the 
now venerable EQ1.

As I see it, the real problem isn't that it takes a long time to level, 
but rather that you've consumed all the content for you're level, and 
will need to kill 400 mobs per level for the next five levels, before 
you can consume new content... and the prospect of killing 2000 'same-
old' mobs is ... unattractive to say the least??
