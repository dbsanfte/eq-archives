Ahh, no.
She shouts when some idiot aggros her.
She doesn't run faster than SoW and will stop often to attempt to
"smite" you.

Of course, it sucks when someone trains her to Karnor and all the
players with shit RoS faction who hunt near Karnor get ganked.
Unfortunately, because her AoE doesn't care if you're allied or not,
if there's even a single KOS person, her Fear/AoE nuke may drop a few
folks.
