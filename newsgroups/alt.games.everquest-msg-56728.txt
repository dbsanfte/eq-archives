I noticed in the druid guild in Kelethin self only druid ports to the
various Velious locations.  For example, there is a Ring of Great
Divide, useable at level 34.  I had not known these existed as they
were not on the list at castersrealm.  I'm happy to be able to port to
Velious without worrying about the mythical  deathtrap called Iceclad,
or is Great Divide has its danger too?
