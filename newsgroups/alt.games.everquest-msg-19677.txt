I do the same with all my characters, I guess it's the time as an
anti-litter druid rubbing off on the others. I'll destroy junk
forages, and on rare occasions when I want to rid myself of spare food
and can't give it away, I'll sometimes drop it a place it might be
found.
The guy I sold ry'gorr sleeves to recently can be very grateful I have
the habit of picking up bags - after his main character had left, I
saw a bag on the ground and found it to be the sleeves. I spent 5
minutes frantically paging his guild to find him, as he'd logged off
his main :)
