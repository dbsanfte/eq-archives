   Yeah, it's the kind of thread that's real easy to say "Ick.  I don't want to
see any more of this crap!"

    A little encouragement is all I needed!  Working on it now.  Well, working
on the first page.  I've picked a background and text color, and managed to make
a couple of banners (if you can call them that) that actually match the colors
I've picked!  I know, real basic stuff, but I'm kinda surprised I pulled it
off.  Anyways, I just have write a basic introduction, write the words "Content
to be added" alot, and I should be able to put something up fairly soon as a
starting off point.  I'll post a link as soon as I ftp something to my
webspace.  It will be real bare bones, but it will give us a something to add to
(and by "us" I mean anyone that takes an interest in this project).

   Monual's stories are already archived somewhere else already, but I'm sure it
wouldn't hurt to have them backed up somewhere.

   Well, as soon as I have a link, I'll post it.  Give it a looksee and see what
you think you might want to add.
