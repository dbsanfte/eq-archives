This is just a guess but it looks like something (hardware or driver)
isn't working in your computer.  When you booted up the game it checked
your resources and found there wasn't enough to run the game at your
normal settings. So it slowed the game down by reducing the video
demands.  When you changed it back the game ran choppy.  Maybe a memory
stick died or something is going on with your video card or driver.
That's where I'd look.
