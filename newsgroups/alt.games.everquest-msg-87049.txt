The pauses are a verant bug and I don't think have to do with your
system. They were trying to eliminate them but I still get them when
new people enter the zone.

You can get them on pretty much any system and 512 more meg of ram
probably won't help or a super hard drive.

Unless you have probs in other applications or games its kind of silly
to spend hundreds of dollars to compensate for verant bugs they are
working on. As far as the geforce 4, only the BEST $299 one is better
than a geforce 3 ti 500 in benchmarks on toms hardware. Of course
those benchmarks don't run games like EQ or AO where lots of other
characters with many textures might go easier with the 128 meg ram on
the geforce 4 cards.
