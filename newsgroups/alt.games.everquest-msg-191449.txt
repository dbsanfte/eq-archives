Ah, to judge John because the world rewarded him for his Art... smacks of
small minded jelousy. He said "Imagine"... if he'd ditched it all to wander
the streets of Hollywood with a Kotex on his head, if he'd decided to ditch
his poetry and Art to bake bread... Christ, you jeering Philistines would
still have crucified him. To disrespect John Lennon is shamefull, but
understandable... you ahte him for the gifts he has that you will never
match. "Imagine" that, jerks.
