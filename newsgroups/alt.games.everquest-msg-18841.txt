Only because I cannot think of a very good reason but... if anyone who has
anything to offer and isn't anonymous or atleast /role, though receive a
/tell from one that is /anon or /role, then why not just do the same?
<shrug>

I'm not looking to troll here now ;)  just curious, Im sure the reason is a
darn good one, I just cannot come up with it since Im continously /role
myself, though as a warrior I usually dont get hit up on for buffs/crack,
though I have been known to respond to a /yell or two.. especially when they
pull it directly in front of me and I see they are about to die... figure I
might as well start hitting it while the dying person is taunting for me.
<grin!> ;p
