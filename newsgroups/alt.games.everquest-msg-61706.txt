Word has it that in Luclin, you'll be able to set your character
to "vendor mode" in the Bazaar zone, and tag parts of your inventory
as "sellable" at a given price.  Then go afk for as long as you
wish, and come back to see what people have purchased from you.
This will help you to become your own "broker", without having
to spend time sitting at the keyboard hawking your wares.
