Did you scam? No  Did you do anything wrong?  Probably not (going by your
side of the story).

Well, now you know...THE standard price on sow potions is 100p per 10-stack.
If someone gives you 300p when you say you have three potions, now you know
that they obviously assumed you meant three stacks.

I know of no one who buys them individually anymore (but I'm not a shaman).
If someone says they want to buy potions, assume they mean a full stack.
