Actually, I was referring to promiscuity, as opposed to homosexuality.  But,
now we see where you're coming from.  You took a statement that had nothing
to do with homosexuality, and tried to make me into an anti-homosexual (I
hate the term homophobe, you don't have to fear to hate, even though you
will most likely hate what you fear).  Was that an attempt to attack my
character, or just invalidate my statement by presenting it as something
it's not?
