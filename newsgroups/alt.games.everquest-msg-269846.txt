Its pretty easy to charm a newbie zone mob, buff and gear it up, and let 
it go, there's no real need to import mobs from other zones just to tear 
up newbies.  Preventing the former would be simple enough, just have all 
buffs drop within a minute of charm break if mob isn't recharmed, have 
all items vanish same way.  Since they don't seem interested in solving 
the griefing potential inherant in normal charming, I doubt preventing 
griefing is a big part of whats stopping them from allowing charmed pets 
to zone.

But if you can charm a mob, then is it really overpowering compared to 
your other capabilities?  The druid's summoned pet can trivialize plenty 
of farming locations (for spiderling silks and the like), but noone 
complains about that.
