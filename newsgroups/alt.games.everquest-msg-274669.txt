Shall we review? I posted this two liner:

"I disagree. The use of the word "pussy" to describe a wimp is
not vulgar or obscene."

The above two liner was then immediately followed up by rude

Allow us to consider what would be happening had a similar exchange
happened in a work place setting. Certain someones would be
having a conversation with HR right now, with some little notes
being added to their file, with a firm and solid C&D resounding
like a loud slap.
