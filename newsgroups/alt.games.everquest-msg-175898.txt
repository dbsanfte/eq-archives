All my currency slots except plat were overflowing. I thought it was
simply the hour and way too much caffeine, so went into the bank near
Shadowhaven and clicked on the copper slot, sure enough it was actually
there....Hmmm. Click on silver slot, instant disconnection.

Ah, to be a millionaire, if only fleetingly, was a great feeling.
Reported it to a Guide, who said they'd file a bug report. Has anyone
else ever experienced this?

Also, that translocation requester asked if I wanted to be transfered to
an "unknown" zone. Twilght Zone maybe?
