Monks. SK feign is a spell, monks a skill. This means the monk can drop at 
any point, even while running. A monk can only fail the skill, while an SK 
can interrupt the cast, fizzle, and fail the skill, not to mention the fact 
that the odds a caster will start casting during the (1.5? second) FD 
casting time are pretty good.
