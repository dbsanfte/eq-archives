Good stinking luck.  I got a mask off him second time I killed him, gave
it to a 59 rogue I owed a favor to (he was wearing the lesser version)
and went back several times in hopes of getting another for my warrior.
I've killed the Lord probably 20 times, no Coif and only the one Mask.
Doubt I'll try again, boring killing hordes of agro greens.  Mask also
has 5MR and is an excellent light source for the nightblind.
