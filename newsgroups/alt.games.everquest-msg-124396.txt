hehe, well hopefully we can say the same too..  On our first real AoW run
(whilst he was still unkilled on Prexus) we got him to, well.. see for
yourself :  http://www.stasisprexus.com/ss/050102_b.jpg

I say first 'real' try, because we pulled him once (when the Statue still
directly popped him) with ~35 people, 3 clerics (1 of which was sitting afk
on the pull, and died heh)

Since the high of that attempt though, we've gone backwards :(   We haven't
been able to hit him very often (he's the new ragefire on prexus!).. not
progressing more really sucks though (how often do you hear of that
happening).. we tried him last week or so, and only got him to 40% this time

I wasn't there for the most recent Tormax gatecrashing, but im a class
leader in my guild, so got to hear all about it from my monk crew... most
peoples fear was they would be warned for training, hence they refused to
pull, and we had to move on.

Hopefully it won't be repeated again, but if it does this time Im sure to be
there (i attend probably 98% of all raids)... this time I believe it will be
different.

I won't train them (honest :P) but I will continue with our normal Tormy
pull sizes (usually pull all the mobs from the archway to tormy room in
2-4s, excluding tormax/wingmen).. but if i pull 4 red con mobs, it is an
honest pull for us to kill... and if they are stupid enough to sit/block us,
well tough shit when the incoming stampede squishes their heads.

The last time it happened, it wasn't delays for their people to arrive..
likewise it was wating for people to *log on*

I had an incident with some of their members the weekend, so they aren't
really my favourite guild right now..  I've been killing the evil dorfs in
EW pretty much every day for the last 2 weeks now (pharming dorf heads to
get my Bods) and about 50% of the time, I've had a monk friend with me.

The monk was always on kael faction (only changed when he joined us
recently, so he has no clue about the coldain ring quest), and I was botting
my shaman, so not really paying much attention to anything outside of the
group.

We started fighting the captain, only to see in /say "I just gave him the
poison you fucking morons!"

So anyway, because they were stood inside the hut, didn't bother sending a
tell, and even saw us killing the dorfs for hours prior, we were supposed to
know they were doing a quest (and how rude to just run into somebody elses
camp and do a quest anyway)

I tried to be suuuuuuuuuper polite with them, explained why he was killed..
when he would repop, why the other monk didn't know what captain beradin was
for etc.. that they should send a damn /tell next time (apparantly
surrounding the mob, is full intent to the zone that your doing a quest).

They were still being mouthy though, and I thought fuck it, im done being
nice...I said either take that attitude elsewhere, or i'll kill beradin the
second he pops on every single pop (I had a legitimate reason to, and if
they wanna come fuck with me and talk to us like shit, like hell am I
helping them do their quest)

Needless to say, the next tormax pull will be fun :)    Its ironic to think
back, when they were first trying AoW, they would call arena/aow camped,
from the zoneline, with ~10 people in the zone (and people would leave them
to it, rather then race them).. somehow I think that won't happen again.

I don't think GM's can action it.. afterall, its not rooted because of a
player bug.  I still think its really lame tho, as does my guild leader.

Well if you don't warp or sploit him, theres no hiding place at all inside
his pit to hide

Lol was Aary up at the same time?

We have a few annoying guilds on prexus (the kind that can't clear ntov, but
sit behind you until aary is dead, then run off ahead and zerg an easy
dragon)

Parking somebody like Vyemm there would make a mighty fine guard :)

I remember a while back in velks, I could get agro every fight if I didn't
fd/delay fighting - the guildie maintank (60war) was using
SoD/willsapper/primal combo.. I think back then i still had ghetto weapons
too.

Obviously its different on a raid (where you let the warrior build agro
before even touching the thing) but agro isn't impossible to get (if you
were stupid enough to want it)

I have an ensnare proccing stick too (tunares sap) but its really only a
solo-toy.  If I use it on a raid, no warrior there is getting agro off me
(nothing like procing ensnare 6 times in a row, whilst doing 60monk dmg to
gain agro).. needless to say its not equipped for raids or I get pwnt.

Saying that though, I tanked Cazic the other day, and that really chuffed me
:)   i wasn't meant to (nor did i have my ensnare stick equipped) but it
ended up really good heh.

My guilds well known for our monk crew (more grandmasters than any class at
our raids) and some of us have tanked various mobs from time to time (dain,
TiV, ntov named, flurry drakes, HoT named, rhags, RC etc) but I haven't seen
any monks tank cazic yet.   I know hes not a super uber mob, but he was a
first for me :)
