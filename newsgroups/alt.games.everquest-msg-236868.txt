This is a dodge (red herring fallacy since you've decided to claim a
philosophical background). The original statement was:

>our current scientific models of the universe.

It IS consistent with current models. "Before time started" involves
factors that can't be observed and are literally "outside" the
universe (if they exist at all); therefore making assumptions about
them, as you are, is no dfferent than religion.

This just isn't true. Evidence abounds about the nature of the origin
of the universe; the problem lies in fitting it together.

Your "devil's advocate" is using the classic creationist trap of
treating all theories as equal.


Some snippage was here...

I think you may be right... but it was very artistically done.

This is indulging in exactly what kooks want - give credence to
theories that simply do not deserve it.

All theories are not equal.

I'll put it another way - your philosophical stance is basically
stating a theory and then find evidence to support it, rather than
proper scientific theory which examines the evidence and deduce the
theory from it.

It's not wise to embrace every kook theory that comes along on the
basis that every theory is equal until disproved.

Only to those who have already decided there must be more.

Deductive logic and scientific process will serve you much better.

Your method would have people listening to Art Bell.

It's not ultimately inexplicable. And your claim that science can't
explain creation is just plain silly. It is getting closer and closer
all the time as more and more evidence comes to light.

The sun coming up every day was once a miracle. So was seeing a comet
in the sky. Or Jesus's face in a jar of mayo. And so on, and so on.
They all had scientific basis in the end, even if it wasn't apparent
to the people making the claim of "miracle".

Your argument simply put is claiming that because one factor hasn't
been explained all theories are equally valid and worthy of
consideration.
