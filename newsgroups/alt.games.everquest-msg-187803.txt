I care because if I want to find a group for my character between the
levels of 10 and 27, it might be refreshingly interesting if I had
more than one zone to choose from.

Yes, I know, I could go to Crushbone or South Karana or Oasis and
there _might_ be a group there that I could join, but it's not
terribly likely.

Can you give me one reason why one zone has to be completely out of
whack with every other in its level range with regards to the amount
of experience it gives per kill?
