As I was approaching level 51, I began to work on a path for my shaman (now
53) for AA's and Experience.

Most of the theories involved either stopping at 51 to get run3 and then
continuing on, or just plain continuing with straight exp until the 60's
before working on any AA's at all.  I am not too concerned with run3 at this
point simply because I have insta-SOW and the shrew spell.

I was thinking, however, about splitting my experience 90% / 10% so that by
the time I ding 60 or close, I have already dinged a few AA's to use in the
general tab.  A friend told me that you loose exp by splitting in any
combination due to the formulas used to compute AA exp and regular exp.

Any thoughts on this?  Will I loose out overall by splitting?  Is my theory
a good one, or not?

Thanks for the help,
