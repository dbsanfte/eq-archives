That's what I did in fact. The tedium was horrible. I wish I would
have used Whirling Wind more in combat instead. I wasn't suggesting
use of Whirling Wind on onesself as practice, rather use of it while
hunting, even if the resists are a PITA.

Sometimes I wonder if the skill increase checker takes into account 
repetitive casting of the same spell. Every now and then I work on
Divination, usually by repeatedly casting Sense Animals. I might get
a point every 20 casts if I'm lucky (skill in the 160s). However,
single casts of Camouflage while traveling seem MUCH more likely
to result in a Divination point. It could be, though, that I cast
Camouflage much more than I realize...
