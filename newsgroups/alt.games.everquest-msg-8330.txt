I agree with the suggestion that continually camping an item/NPC is farming.   
Anytime you are in a dungeon and you hear the words "Camp Check" and half a
dozen people respond, then you are in a zone with farmers, not questers.  You
do not "Camp" an elite gnoll in blackburrow, you do not "Camp" a mammoth in
everfrost, and in this case, you do not "Camp" a hermit...you are farming them.
 Just an opinion, but for what its worth, it should be frist come first serve
on spawns.
