Assuming that the power is just out to your house, and not the node,
as long as you have the cable modem plugged into the ups (it does
require it's own power supply) then you shouldn't be dropped offline.

With the modem NOT plugged into the UPS, it WILL drop you when it
looses power, but (with mine, at least) when power is restored, you
should be back online within 30 seconds.

Just long enough for you to have timed out, of course, and pick up
your hopefully not dead character and start playing again. =)
