The mob sizes can have a lot to do with this.  There are huge mosquitos in
Emerald Jungle, for example, that *look* like they are right on top of you,
even when out of spell range.  Giants are a bit like that, but the effect is
not as pronounced, probably because with mosquitos, you are used to small
ones, and that helps through off your perception.

You can see this effect in the real world if you encounter a vehicle that is
much larger than ones you are used to.  I used to live a couple miles from
an Air Force base, which mostly had B-52s and KC-135s.  Occasionally, a C5A
would fly by, on the same flight path the B-52s used, and it would seem to
be a lot closer, because it was so much bigger than the B-52s.  (And it
would seem to be moving a lot slower, too).
