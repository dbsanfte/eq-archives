You can have all the veteran awards on a level 1 toon - it's not the toon
level that matters, it's the account age.

I have a level 20 cleric who enjoys the double XP sessions in Paludal :)

As someone else posted, the exploit was to gain access to NO DROP loot on
the corpses of anyone you fancied.  A number of Anguish geared toons were
stripped before it was spotted.

First warning I saw was on the shaman boards, then copied to the warrior
boards.  I took great pains to calm down the members of my guild who were
up in arms about yet another prime-time patch.  If I recall, it took one
hour and not the four they were predicting too.
