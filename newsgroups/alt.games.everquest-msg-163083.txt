Making more profit.

Suppose it costs C per subscriber to cover their costs.  Suppose they have N
subscribers at $10.  Suppose the will lose L subscribers because of the jump
from $10 to $13.

Profit before:  N*(10-C) = 10N - NC

Profit after: (N-L) * (13-C)

Profit after will be greater than profit before as long as:

    L/N < 3/(13-C)

We don't know what C is.  Worst case, C is very close to zero, they would
come out ahead even if the price increase caused them to lose up to 23% of
their customers.  For higher values of C, they can afford to lose even more,
and come out ahead.

Of course, losing 20% of the subscribers would probably change the
per-subscriber support costs, so the above analysis would need to be
modified.  I'll leave that to someone else...the results will be similar.

The thing about MMORPGs right now is that they don't substitute for each
other.  DAoC went from zero to 200k subscribers without putting a dent in
EQ's growth.  EQ released a couple of expansions without hurting DAoC.  EQ
and DAoC didn't hurt UO.  SWG *might* change this, because of the "Star
Wars" tie, which seems to interest a lot of people, but for now, the MMORPGs
are not really in competition with each other.  If they were, you'd see
prices going down, not up, but for now, prices going up is what to expect.
