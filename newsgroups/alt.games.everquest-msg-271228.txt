Ok, this is kinda a stupid question, but is there a way to take your hood
off when you are wearing a robe?  I saw some screenshots of players wearing
a robe that looked like mine (though I don't know if it was really the same
one) and they had no hood on.  Also, I saw one person in the game who I knew
was wearing the same robe as mine (newbie mage quest robe) and she had the
hood off.  Thanks in advance!
