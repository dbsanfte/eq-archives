Again, like i said to others,  put the old code back...  30 seconds no
traffic until you go LD but no LD on 'blue' servers...  Just disconnect.
That is how it used to be prior to PvP servers...  The code was changed for
PvP to keep cheats from avoiding death in fights...  Leave it on those
servers...
