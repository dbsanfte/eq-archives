Dang... the name evades me but there are frog like creatures in the
original monster  manual.   Bog or bull something... they even had
them in the D&D cartoon that played on saturdays.   Id say they would
be more of a direct rip than the Slaadi, but the Slaadi are on the
same track.

...

OH How Id like to see  Froglok Monks, and Beastlords...
and on that same thought.  Undead Froglok SK's and Necros would be
sweet.
