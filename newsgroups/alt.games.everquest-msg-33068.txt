On the accused players guild website, he claims he saw the AC standing
there, ran up and did get the first "blow" in, hence he didnt kill steal.

My ranger guildy claims to have had the AC snared, DOTed, and rooted while
he medded, sitting near.
I have limited caster experience, but would'nt casting on a mob, be the
first "blow"?

I'm not sure if my guild ranger /reported at the time or not.  way too late
now of course. oh well, trying to move on.

I know this is all pissing in the wind, but still, helps to know these
things. Got about half the money for Tboots. When and if I get the full
amount, I'll have to see if I can dump that much into them.  5600pp buys a
LOT of sow potions ;-)
