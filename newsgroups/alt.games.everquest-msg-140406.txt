Talk to a shaman, get DS potions.  You can get a DS potion that does your
level/2+1 damage, and lasts for your level/4 minutes.  It stacks with
Druid/Ranger DS.  Level 58 Druid puts 32pt DS on you, you drink potion, at
level 60, that adds 31pts.  You now have 63pts of DS on you.  At level 50,
druid casts 24pt DS, potion gives 26pts, that's 50 pts.  Still think its not
useful?

Your example mob, does 10k damage, that's 100 hits, that means the mob has
taken 6300pts from the DS (5000 if we are talking level 50).  Oh wait, he
died some time ago, didn't he?  That's not counting any damage you managed
to inflict on him in the meantime.

With your example, the mob dies due to the DS alone after inflicting 4k
damage when we are talking level 50.

Instead of the shaman potion, get a 25 pt DS from a level 50 mage, almost
the identical effect.  I don't think it stacks with the potion, as both are
fire based.

Even assuming just druid DS, 24pts at level 50.  Thats 2400 damage for the
10k damage inflicted in your example.
