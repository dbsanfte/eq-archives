Depends.  Skill increases in what?  Any weapon skill will have a chance to
go up regardless of which hand its held in.  The difference will be that
mainhand attacks more often for more chances.
Offhand weapons proc'ing - typically, no.  It's said that some weapons proc
more often others (say 3% compared to 2%) but offhand has less chances.

You should almost never let a proc decide which hand you'll hold a weapon
in, especially a 1HS.  The *chance* for a proc of a 1HS is not worth the
lost damage to not being able to backstab... ever.  The exceptions might be
if you're lacking a specific class and pretty much need the proc effect for
the fight (ie. No Dru/Rng so using an SBD in main even if it means less
dmg).

For mainhand weapon, always a piercer.  Period.  If your weapon choices are
close, you'll probably want the lower delay one in mainhand.  Lower delay
means that, post-20, you will get your damage bonus applied more often.
Exceptions have to do with backstab damage.  I swapped out a 10/21 for an
11/22.  Lower dmg/sec, technically, but one point more on a backstab weapon
adds up VERY quickly.

As far as offhand:  OFFHAND DAMAGE IS 100% ABOUT RATIO, NOTHING ELSE.   So,
offhand, a 10/20 = 12/24 = 8/16.  There is no damage bonus to offhand
weapons.

> wanna use poison but those procs are free. Any advice on what to

Just remember that different procs have different agro levels.  A
locustlure's Slow (no dmg) has much more agro than a Bloodpoint's 80-point
lifetap.

Rogues have Evade for a reason.  By the end of a fight (with an 'average'
group), the rogue should barely be touched.  Tanks are there to take the
damage and I'll let the cleric focus on him, not me.  Exceptions come when
you have no real tank and need to be ready to take a few hits to help
protect the casters.

Oh, also make sure that the tank is right in the mob's face and the rogue is
at max melee distance.  Proximity has a large effect on agro (try a rooted
mob for an example).  Even at my level, it's amazing how many tanks don't
know this.

Sometimes, that is the way to do it.  If I have a few failed evades in a row
and I get the agro, sometimes I just have to stop attacking until the tank
gets more agro than me.  While I'm standing there, I'll keep evading every
chance.  Once I have a success, I'm right in the action.

Come to the Safehouse (see sig).  Get to the forums, read through the
Library and the Training Studio's FAQ.  After that, post a question.  If you
don't do your pre-reading, expect a taunting response :)

I'm leading the "Make the Safehouse a Rogue site again" crusade.
