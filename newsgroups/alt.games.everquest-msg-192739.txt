    Spider silks, uncombined. I bought 28 off vendors in Firiona Vie (the
zone) last night for a wee bit over 2 gold each, then put them up on my
trader at 2 AM PST for 2.5 plat each. I came back this morning at 9:30 AM
PST, and all had sold - and I had crashed to character select at some point
during the night. Oh, and that price I set them at was tied with another
seller as the lowest price in The Bazaar.
