June's PC Gamer covers EQ2 really well.

Yes it will be different game. Different game mechanics, Only three
continents (the original) with a slightly different history (i.e.
Pallies lose to Militia in FP). Items have a lifespan and need to be
replaced. Merchant PCs. No CRs unless you want a rezz. Only three
"skills",  No exp loss, rather you incur an exp debt you pay off with
a portion of future exp. Items all have a lifespan in an effort to
make the economy work , ect, ect, ect

And for you Twink haters, items will be level dependent so they won't
work well below recommended level and have a greater chance of
"breaking" if used by lowers.

No Transfers, different game, all will start over.

No comment on EQ1's future in the article.

EQ2 may not be for everybody. Same name, races, spells but a very
different game.

>game if it will all be scrapped soon in place of EQ2?

They want EQ2 to be newbie friendly and fix the economy too. Instead
of force people to play this game you will have a choice. Imagine the
flames here if somebody who is happy with twinking discovers his uber
twink risk have things break very quickly because verant imposed a new
set of rules on him.

Better get that organized before hand.

>Not to mention all the questions I have about actual game content......
>No universal bank?

Yes this will change in EQ2 banks will be localized.

>Pack horses?

They will have PC caravans which that PC will have to hire other PCs
to protect as it crosses the continent from MoBs.

>100 levels?

Yes 100 levels possible more

>Breaking gear?

Yes, in the name of "functional economy"
