Wow, many weirdities there.  I've never heard of a bat dropping
basilisk eggs, and I've never heard that bit of flavor text either,
though I admit I haven't done a lot of hunting in BB.

As for what use they have, take a look at www.eqtraders.com; there
are about 5-6 recipes that use them.  I wouldn't be surprised if
they got used in a quest also, but Alla's doesn't list any.

Note also that there are two different items, "Basilisk Egg" and
"Basilisk Eggs".  Many -- but not all -- of the recipes shown on
eqtraders seem to accept either.  If what you found really was the
plural form, it's even weirder, since that's listed as turning up
only as a foraged item in Rathe Mountains.
