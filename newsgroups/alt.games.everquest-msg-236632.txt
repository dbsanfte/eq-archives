Sheesh.

I put in a ":P"  - indicating tongue-in-cheek humor.....

However... In the first post of mine in this thread, I saw no need to quote
anything as every newsreader these days groups your threads nicely.... but
I'll do so in the future just to doubly make it clear to everyone.

Also Seeq said I top posted.... which I suppose I did, but it wasn't really
a top post because I didn't quote anything (Makes it more of a "full post" I
guess doesn't it?

And I see no harm in top posting anyway...... but lets not get into that.
(The evils of using MSOE)

Hehhe.
