No. It will fail however, if you're stealthed and an invisibility or
illusion spell fades on you; though your hide / sneak buttons will still
appear to active. Same goes if you accidentally right-click on a corpse
you're dragging; re-hide as soon as you can.

Also, be sure to consider everything you can [1] to make sure the mob
you're creeping up on really can't see you. If in doubt, sneak behind if
you can.

>What happen if I take falling damage, does it go away?

Only if you die.

>What if I am Lev'd and it drops, and I accelerate rapidly to the ground?  
>Does it drop then?

Dropping isn't the problem, it's the landing you have to worry about.

>Do I ever get to go faster when I Hide / Sneak?

From level 51 onwards, your speed will increase marginally each time you
level, to normal speed at level 60.

>So much to learn...

Then get going, OK slick?

The Safehouse is a chore to read for me too, but that's for different
reasons.

[1] Remember however, that considering any mob whilst sneaking from
behind will return an 'indifferent' (Non-aggressive) message.
