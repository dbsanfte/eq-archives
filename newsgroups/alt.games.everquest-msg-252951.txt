Yep, different strokes for different folks. :) I do remember doing my 
french homework with WordStar... Of course, the way I did it was just to 
print it out, and then draw in the accents, circumflexes, and cedillas by 
hand.

-Anything- other than trying to figure out WP.  Actually, now that I think 
about it, I don't think there -was- WP for CP/M...  I was probably done 
with french before that came out, and had moved on to russian, where I was 
hosed either way. :)

>Must be a century ago...

Heh, sure seems like it, don't it? :)
