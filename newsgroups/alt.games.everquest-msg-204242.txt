Dunno about a necro, but for an SK puller it seems to be an incredibly
useful item. Between a CoS and their ability to pick any one spedific
mob out of a group and park it when they feign. Given the right
circumstances (not many see invis mobs), I've often seen an SK I
regularly group with pull a named mob through a fully popped dungeon
and park it by the group w/o adds. Not really sure how he does it but
it always impresses the hell out of me. <g>
