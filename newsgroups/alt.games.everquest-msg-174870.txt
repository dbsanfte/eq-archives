This is true, but Dennis's point still stands for countries (and political
leaders/dictators) who *don't* care.  I have no trouble believing that one
day, possibly very soon, someone will get their hands on nuclear weapons who
(1) doesn't care if we retaliate, (2) doesn't think we'll know who to
retaliate against, or (3) thinks we're too pathetic to have the nerve to
retaliate (a la bin Laden).

In other words, suppose I own a bank, and I have employed the best private
detectives and forensic experts in the world -- I might be pretty damn sure
that if anyone robs my bank I'll catch them.  It would, however, still be
eminently stupid of me not to also employ guards to protect my bank.  If you
tried to tell me that anyone who tried to rob my bank would have to be
stupid so I shouldn't have any guards, well, guess what, a frighteningly
large percentage of humanity is amazingly stupid.  I'm not going to base my
security on a misplaced faith in the intelligence of every person who might
want to rob me.
