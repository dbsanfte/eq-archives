Chaotic stab is one of those skills that isn't very usefull if you
aren't soloing.  The refesh rate on backstab is 10 seconds without
haste.  With 40% haste, which most rogues will have by the time they
get chaotic stab, it drops to 7 seconds.  As a level 60 rogue with
around 1275 ATK, accuracy is around 40% to 45%. For simplicity we'll
say 50%.  So, roughly every 14 seconds you do 120 damage instead of
the average 50. Basically 70 extra damage every 14 seconds. An extra
5dps when soloing.  For 6 aaxp points it isn't bad imho, if you're a
rogue that likes to solo.  Of course, how often do you see rogues
soloing?

In a group it isn't nearly as usefull.  Only when the MOBs positioning
is screwed up and the rogue can't reach the MOBs back, when the rogue
has agro, or when the rogue screws up and hits backstab at angle that
isn't in backstab range.  Otherwise the rogue will be doing regualar
backstab damage anyway.  Which is hopefully a vast majority of the
time.

As for assassinate, I think people overestimate it's power.  Yeah,
it's cool when it works, but considering it only works on MOBs that
are 46 or below and humanoid, it isn't as great as it sounds.  There
is only a small range of levels that MOBs are blue at 60 and can be
assassinated.  With the last patch you don't get as much exp from low
blue MOBs.  So it is even less usefull.  Not to mention it's fairly
unreliable.  For me, it's just a toy.
