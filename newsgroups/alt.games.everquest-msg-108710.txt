	Big advantage to raising STA is that once you break 100 you no longer take
combat penalties for running out of fatigue.

	STR gear is easy to come by (without prom-queening).  Ivy Tunic and
Sleeves both have STR on them (and they're not hard to quest for, meaning
these days they're even easier to buy).  Iksar Scale Gloves, DWB's and Mithril
Greaves are all commonly sold at low prices and all good choices for a
low-level Ranger.  (Serious twinks will probably go for Crystal Chitin...I'm
not going to discuss the ones in full Tolan's.)  Many popular twink weapons
(Centi, Wurmslayer, Lammy) have STR on them as well.
