I am PLing my 35 dru right now with my 57 rng. Hey I need a taxi :P I
always try to PL my dru while I am camping something.
Pled from 12-18 in Dragnor Castle while camping Bigle. I have yet to see
him.
Pled from 19-28 in LOIO. Now that was boring.
Pled from 29-35 in FV while camping the AJ for the VP key. Got it, but
MQ it with a friend.
Pling 35 in IC, while working on the Eye Patch of Plunder Quest
(Stormfeather atm). I have looted so far 4 cougar claws earrings and 2
HQ pelt (Cougarskin mask quest).

Technic so far. RNG pulls, snares and roots. DRU than cast Immolate and
Drones of Dooms. Sit. Ranger pulls an other one and parks it close to
the first one. then DRU DoT. Sits, meds and refreshs when needed. Ranger
gives the last blow to save mana. A yellow per hour. At least one mob is
always on the grill :)
