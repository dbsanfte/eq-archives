Low level (under 10) is much faster and there is no corpse run under 10th
level and you don't lose exp for dying until 11th level now.

The "hell levels" have been eliminated and the extra exp was spread out over
the levels.

No need to look at the spell book when medding anymore for ALL levels

You can now right click a corpse and it will tell you how long before it
decays (and how long you have to get a rez).

Lot's of new focus items have been added and a lot of newbie armor quests
(very race/class specific)

Lot's of new trade skill recipes have been added

Some of the newbie zones have been changed-new camps, MOB's loot added

Cazic-Thule is 50+ zone now

Those are all of the big ones I can remember off the top of my head.  There
have been tons of smaller fixes/changes and the new UI was just introduced
last week which is an amazing huge change.
