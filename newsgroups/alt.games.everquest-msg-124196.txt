Interesting concept... my additions,
  
Shaman = Level 34 (well rounded utility char, soloability, pet)

Necromancer = Level 20 (Pet finally has some hits, enough mana to fearkite)

Cleric = 39 (complete heal, so good it eclipses everything else)

Rogue = 51 (ragebringer ... if you've got a guild).

Warrior = 55 (/discipline defensive)

Paladin = don't ask.
