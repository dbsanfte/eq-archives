/caveat what follows is opinion, regardless of grammatical form

Actually David, the real problem has nothing to do with wealth,
or race/culture, or gender.  The things that created and sustain
the never-ending conflict are selfishness, jealousy, tribalism,
populism (and other forms of political posturing), the common
desire for "silver bullet" solutions, and the apparent inability
of any people/government I have ever seen or heard of to accept
that the status quo can never be maintained (things always go to
hell over time).

The same person who whines about "affirmative action" will turn
right around and speak admiringly of his wife's cousin's great
government job that he only has to show up for 5 hours a day
and gets 8 weeks paid vacation.  The difference?  The first
"gravy train" (his perception of "affirmative action") is not
available to him, while he cherishes the hope that someday he
too will get a spot at the same trough as his wife's cousin.

The same political activist/politician will rail against the
unchanging discriminatory practices in [insert your favorite
location/industry/whatever here], demanding repeated change
until [insert favorite desired outcome here], and be willfully
blind to the fact that any sort of entitlement program (and
most affirmative action implementations take that form) will
attract scammers like flies to a dung pile, and the longer
the particular program remains in place the more of the
scammers' friends and relatives and acquaintances will edge
up to the teat and start sucking.

People demand "silver bullets", political people will stake
their reputations and careers on whatever "silver bullet"
they think will sell to the voters, and another program is
born.  If the program fails it has an excellent chance of
having its funding increased several times before it finally
dies in a morass of venality and corruption.  If the program
succeeds it is even worse, years later it will have become a
monster sucking up tax money in ever growing amounts for
less and less benefit and sustaining yet another entitlement
class for no discernable reason.  And so people demand yet
another "silver bullet", and the dragon is slain, but nobody
gives a fucking thought to the still unresolved issues it
was created to respond to (they may whine about the "issues"
but they don't actually give any thought to dealing with
them).

So, instead of attacking complex social problems over and
over with varying tactics that are dropped when they fail
or have achieved what they can, we respond with massive
entitlement programs that end up reinforcing all the petty
jealousies that fueled the problems in the first place.

And, though you no doubt will refuse to believe it, your little
snipes at "rich white men" are as much a part of the problem
as every other expression of jealousy or xenophobia towards
"them", whoever the hell "they" may be for the particular
speaker/writer.
