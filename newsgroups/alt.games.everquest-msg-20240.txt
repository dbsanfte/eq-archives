Ok, I'm ready to have the house flamed down, but I think that the naming
policy for EQ is too strict. I agree with the parts about vulgar language
and copyright stuff, but disagree with the rest of it. I feel if a person
wants to name the character "Vacuum Cleaner" they should be able to. Hey,
other than getting a few laughs and strange looks, it doesn't disrupt
gameplay. But it's not RPing you say, well, I say that the game itself is
not true RP. The only place its close is on the PvP servers. All you people
who just jumped up shouting "I RP" let me ask a few questions.
1. When was the last time you played your whole time with everyone in your
party using their native language?
2. How often is it you find yourself hunting along side an opposite good or
evil race?
Aahh I digress, im sorry, Back to names.
I just feel that a person should be able to name their character as they see
fit in a much less restrictive way.

I am sure there will be many responses and hope that all will be civil and
without vulgarity.
