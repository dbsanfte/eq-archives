NOthing is set in stone yet, but it is starting to look more like I'd be
teaming my cleric up with his bard.  For one simple little reason.  My
husband never found my half-elf to be very cute (*sniffle*), but he's got
a soft spot for dark elf women.  So I conceded that this could be my toon
for being eye candy for the guy.  And, well, he thinks plate is hotter
than robes.

So that's that. :P  It's all good though...I like my little blueberry
medic.  She's still a little too angsty, but hopefully a handsome dark elf
musician (he's got the mask at level 8 already, of course, not that he can
use it yet) can bring her around.  

STILL...I'm going to save your email Lance, because by no means am I going
to delete my magician, and Rakyn could turn around and change his mind
tomorrow. Not like he's never done it before.
