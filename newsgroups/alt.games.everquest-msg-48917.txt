A better (easier) evil combo would be shaman/necro. You could start as iksar
if you neded to be in the same starting city. Shama/necro could pair up for
xp right up to 60, no troubles. Necro could by humself, but shaman makes it
oh so much easier.

If you dont like iksar/kunark, a DE necro/troll shaman start reasonably
close to one another.

Druid necro would work as well if you have to have ports, but you cant be an
evil druid.
