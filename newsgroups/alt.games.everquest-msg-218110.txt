It could very well be that people play EQ *in spite of* the EQ
tradeskill system.  Tradeskillers in EQ seem pretty rare to me
(at least at reasonably high levels of talent).  That may point
to the EQ tradeskill system not being worthwhile to most players.

That, in turn, may point to the EQ tradeskill system being
poorly balanced.  Which is my argument in a nutshell.  It's been
my experience that most master tradeskillers and most tradeskill
sites agree with the assessment that's it's too expensive, too
tedious, and generally not worthwhile.  i.e., It needs work.

On the other hand, it may be that people just plain aren't much
interested in tradeskills; however, I don't think that's true,
because tradeskills are much more popular on other MMORPG's.
