Sirens (the mermaids)  are doable at 11 for melees(12 for mage, new spells),
they always spawn at level 12 and are static and non-aggro, they do still
give exp at 16, but they green out at 17 or so, so he's a bit past prime on
those, but Highpass would work, as would Xorbb or the Karanas, or you could
head to LoIO like every other lemming (which would probably work nicely
given the Oasis hunting, god I hate that zone)
