There's always another way to look at it.

Is it really to hard to fathom that some people who would otherwise *fuck* 
with people might not do so if it is demonstrated (by example) exactly how 
traceable their actions are by anyone with half a clue?

Sure.  Go ahead.  Stalk so-and-so in a newsgroup.  Read all the lovely 
header information and have a nice go a your chosen victim.  Just 
remember, the playing field is level and you better have one mother of an 
anonymous remailer if you don't want retaliation for it.  And if you want 
to stalk in real life, hey, that's a lot harder than just digging up your 
victim's whereabouts, and even harder to get away with without facing 
legal consequences.

By the way... Hi.  I'm Remington.  I live in Davis, CA, and I'm annoyed 
with my current lame ISP, and was hoping for some sage words of advice 
about a better one.  Damn those misleading subject: lines...
