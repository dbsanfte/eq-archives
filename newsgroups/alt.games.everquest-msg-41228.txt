    It's more than just auto-attack being on, or latency. That's what VI
always assumed it was, and that's why the monk community had to hit them
over the head until they LOOKED at it. I was able to reproduce it with ease
before the patch: was pulling when a necro Darknessed what I was pulling and
sent in pet. My auto attack is off, my back is to the mob. Thinking I may
have jumped his pull, I feign - no message, so feign has been successful.
Except the mob keeps pounding on me. The necro sees that I was pulling,
pulls pet off and Feigns. I stand up, Feign again and mob goes away.
