Honestly, if you are playing eq to get a sense of satisfaction and
personal worth by somehow being 'better' or more powerful than other
players, that's pretty sad.  This is exactly why I'm glad there ARE
PvP servers for those who chose to play on them.

Having power in eq is like declaring 'I am the emperor of ice cream!'
It might make you feel like a million bucks, but to anyone else in the
world you arent anything special.

I really wish someone would explain to me the point of being on a PvP
server if you ARENT in the vanguard of power.  Do people enjoy being
bullied around by those who simply started playing the game before
they did?

Personally I'd rather work WITH other folks to accomplish goals,
whether they wear the same tag as me or not, than trying to beat them
down.  I can play quake if I want to do that, its a lot more
satisfying in those types of games.  And it still means nothing.
