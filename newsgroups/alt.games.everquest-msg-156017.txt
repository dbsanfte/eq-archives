No they are not because there are plenty of orc pawns and rusty
swords to go around. Dragon? Once a week. Lame.

This difference is internal to the game only.

About the same as it does for a rusty sword to unbalance a kill of an orc
captain kill. Same shit different level.

No difference between a group of level 10 people getting together
to kill a level 15-20 mob than a group of level 50 people killing a level
60 mob. EXCEPT that the level 15 mob spawns every 20 minutes and
the 60 mob only spawns once a week. I am sorry but THAT'S BULLSHIT!
