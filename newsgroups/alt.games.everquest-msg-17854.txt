If you are a Paladin you are a Tank therefore AC is King.
Everything else is secondary.

For my tanks I use this list to Order what you should look for
in gear stats:

1. AC
2. AC
3. AC
4. Resists (for high levels)
5. Stamina
6. Hit points
7. Agility
8. Strength
9. Dexterity
10. (everything else)

Good analysis. Your weapon choice is determined by your group
makeup and the monsters you are fighting.

Depends on your level. At level 50 6 widom = 60 mana.

(Your level) / 5 = mana points per wisdom point.
So if you are 25th level then 6 wisdom = 30 mana.
