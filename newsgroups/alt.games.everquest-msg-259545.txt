If someone asks for help, then they get what they get, and let me tell 
you, if I have any suspicion that they are really deliberately getting 
into trouble and then coming screaming to me for help so they can get 
PL'd by me, they are soon disabused of the notion, because if its at all 
convenient, I take care of the situation in a way that denies them the 
exp and loot from the mob they wanted help on.

I was talking strictly from a standpoint of "helping" someone who hadn't 
asked for help at all.

Well heal was only first on the list of possible interventions; 
admittedly the least likely to see an objection, but there are other 
options that don't risk KSing charges.

Yes indeed, and thats the way the community has developed; in order to 
accomodate the people who don't want help even if it would mean the 
difference between dying and not dying, we generally don't help at all 
unless asked.  A kinder, gentler EQ would be possible, where we all try 
and save each other's butts... but that isn't the way its evolved.

I think part of the reason for this is that despite the gut reaction we 
have to death, really EQ death is a mere temporary inconvenience, a 
slight setback.  So here we come charging in to save someone's life... 
only to be set back on our heels because the guy was happily trying his 
damnedest to conquer a tough situation, only to have us rob him of it, 
and for what?  To save him a little running time to get back to his 
body, and a little lost exp.  Matter of viewpoint; my characters 
generally act as though death of others was a major concern, yet their 
own deaths are minor inconveniences; my enchanter friend treats her own 
death as if it were a major catastrophy, yet is quite happy to view my 
death as a laughing matter (which is how I present it)

The other funny thing is that when someone -does- ask for help, and then 
you don't, some of -those- people start foaming at the mouth.  You're 
under no obligation to help when asked, and at any rate can't be blamed 
if you happen to be paying attention to something offline, or in a chat 
channel, or lom or any number of other things and miss the call for help 
entirely.
