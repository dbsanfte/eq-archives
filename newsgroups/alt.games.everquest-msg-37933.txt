Hmm - I was up and to the left.  Way way WAY up.  Those 
cliffs are very ... surprising sometimes btw - was madly 
chasing a running Kobold up one (groupie wouldn't let me 
use root cause they hit too hard, but what a pita when I 
didn't have enough mana for a finishing nuke) and 
suddenly groupie goes "GET DOWN FROM THERE YOU WANNA 
KILL YOURSELF???"  I look down and somehow, I've managed 
to climb a sheer drop and am just going over the edge 
and down the other side.  Luckily only 36 points of 
damage since I screeched to a halt and started doing the 
switchback route, but it'd be rather easy to take a 
running start and kill yourself there.  I hear there's 
also some waterfall or something that high-levels are 
taking turns jumping off of?  Are you guys THAT bored? 
:)  Also heard shouts (before I turned shout AND ooc 
off, yes, we know there are different opinions about the 
TLC, please shut up now...) of some kind of giant panda-
like creature that was immune to magic? and dropped a 
couple different items - somebody complained about it 
dropping only a large-race back item, and someone else 
said they got a pretty good robe (?) off of it earlier.  
Sounded like it spawned often, too.

Yes, well, it wasn't the trains I minded.  Like I said I 
was well off the tracks.  But if you're about to die, 
kindly do not spot me on a hill and decide to use me as 
a distraction, or I shall have to break out my voodoo 
doll on your butt.
