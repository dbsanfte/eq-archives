Just fyi, the 50 gp is unneeded. I did the quest on my mage to respec to 
conjure.

What happens is he asks for the ruby, you give it to him, he takes your 
specs down to 49, then says you promised him 50gp. I just left without 
paying the scammer. =P

Also to raise up evoke spec you can go find a soulbinder and chain nuke 
them with your cheapest mana nuke until it goes to where you want it.
