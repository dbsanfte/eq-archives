I have to warn you my Chimp has had quite a bit of abuse in it's lifetime
and can be unpredicatable and at times even dangerous. Definately not a
family pet unless you like the idea of waking up one morning to find your
wall decorated with your children... : O

He is currently in solitary confinement on Tunare after being charged with
an indencent public act with a froglok, and there will remain until he stops
muttering, drooling and twitching... oh, and I scrape together the 50 bucks
bail money to bring him to Xev for rehab of course.

Besides he seems to have taken a shining to someone else and I would hate to
stand in the way of true.... um.... actually I don't think a word has been
invented yet that would describe it. Feel free to coin you own term, just
make sure it somehow suggests "fondness, drool and large inanimate objects
in unnatural places"...
