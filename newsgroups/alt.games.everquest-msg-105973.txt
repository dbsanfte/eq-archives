No, he's talking about damage increase being the common measurement, not
attack speed increase.  Then he goes on to calculate weapon delays from the
damage increase measurement.  But the guy you're replying to, and myelf,
both think he's wrong in that most people measure attack speed increase, not
damage increase.  Weapon delay never had anything to do with it except at
the end of his article, he provides algorithms for calculating weapon delay
from damage increase measurements.

If the two ways are damage output and attack speed increase: I agree.
