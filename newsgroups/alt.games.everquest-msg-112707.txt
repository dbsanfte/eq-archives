I think you've missed the point, altogether.   At the lower levels,
you're better off focusing on developing skills and getting your most
critical level one spells than youa are in making a mad dash out of
newby land.

Go back into newby land and kill lots of stuff.  Boring as heck, yes.
But you need the cash to buy your spells.  Then, go outside the newby
area and kill blues to get your skills to move up.   You may have to
group because you've levelled faster than you've improved skills.
