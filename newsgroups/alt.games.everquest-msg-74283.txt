Basicly where there are light races. You can go alot of places, just make
sure to con EVERYTHING.

Simple enough 12

Port self at 20, others at 30 (i beleave. I have never played a wiz, but it
is somewhere close to that) You can port alot of different places. For
specific answers on where to buy what, and when to buy it would be found at
http://eq.castersrealm.com in the wizards section. Very good and complete
spell list on every class

> 4.  What are hell levels?  What are the hell levels for Wizards?
Hell levels are the same for everyone. 30, 35, 40, 45, 50-60

I dont see why not, that wizard AE spell could really save your but, but
beware, can also kill everyone if someone has alot of mobs mezed.

> 6.  What armor can a wizard use.  Will Wizards have to make their own
armor?

Wizards can wear caster armor. Mostly it will be armor dropped by mobs, with
+ int modifyers

> 7.  I'm putting all my skill points in medatate, is this good?
 NO, only put 1 point into Meditation at first. Meditation goes up fast
enough. Save those skill points to boost your Specilazation, and or Other
types of casting skills. I am not sure which is best for a wizard.
