I don't think that's dumb...my one wish goes even further
(and closer to the pen&paper RPGs that lots of EQ is based
on):

Let warriors, monks, and rogues cast certain low level spells
from scrolls.  Only 51+, and they'd have to train several AA levels
to represent "training" in that certain art.

A rogue that could Feign Death.  A warrior with a lifetap
proc.  A monk that could channel his Chi into a DA-type
spell.  A rich warrior that could pass out SoW spells
from his mentor.  Give the casters the ability to Make Scrolls
that could be sold to other players.

And when I say low level, I mean it.  Like Disease Cloud, SoW,
Drowsy...but not Breeze or even Snare.  Make the religious
symbols usable by any follower of that diety, reguardless of class
(my Gnome SK would love a mana-free DoT, and I can think of
some Innoruk rogues who would shout their devotion if they could
use that snare-effect on that symbol).

Just an idea.
