What class/race do you play?
My main is a Gnome Enchanter, which makes talking to the NPC that give you 
the first flag for the DoN mission quests very easy( untill they nerf it :p)
I am apperencive to good side , Dub to evil side. NPC wont talk to you 
,untill they are least Indiff  to you.
I mem Collaberation spell. first tried to dast on the Quest NPC giver," this 
Soandso is unaffected".
Casting on the guards out side of the camps made me Ambly to one side or the 
other
