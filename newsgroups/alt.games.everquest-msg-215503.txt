What you're describing is a network vpn allowing anyone behind IP1 to
get to the network behind IP2, and most users getting into work don't
do that.

For the most part a user will have some sort of connection software,
which cares not a lick for address space as long as it's routeable.
Once that connection is made you have a tunnel from your machine to
the destination network and ssh will work peachy.

But as for the OP, dynamic should work fine.
