Be aware that Sneak is only effective if you're *behind*
the mob.  If you wander into their actual field of vision
(which is more restricted than their 360-degree aggro "radar"),
it doesn't help at all.  Sneak seems to have about a 140 degree
"safe zone".

And this includes the case where something causes them
to turn around and face another direction, one which is
aimed more towards you than they had been originally.  If they
turn to face you, you'll be caught.
