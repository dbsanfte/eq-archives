OK SK guild in Paineel...   Enter the city via the Rock elevator...
follow path out to a Half Moon looking druid circle.... U turn to
right to go through a Gate/porcullis.... Dead ahead is the SK
guild.... I do belive when you enter the door go to the Left.... the
hall to right I think leads to the PVP area...

Good Luck
