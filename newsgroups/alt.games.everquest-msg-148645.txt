A friend was in the Bazaar yesterday when a couple of items came up in
links, first was called "rwtest AC RING" and had stats of +100 to pretty
much (AC, hp, mana, saves) everything this was a ring (funnily enough)
equipable by all. The other was called "Oakwind" was a Ranger only bow with
175dam 20del 150rng.
Is it possible to spoof a link to an item, ie make an item up, or do these
things actually exist?
With the name for the ring it looks like an item off of the test server and
not something that should yet be seen on Bristlebane.
