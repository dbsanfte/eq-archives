I have a lev 20 human monk currently bound in freeport and fighting in
oasis.  I just turned lev 20 and need a new place to fight.  Any
suggestions would be much appreciated.  Should I change my bind point?

I am having a tough time getting money for wu's items.  I have terrible
equip and do not have much more then 200pp in the bank.  Any hints on
getting money or that equipment?


Thanks In Advance
