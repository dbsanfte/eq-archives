Oh my... you do realize you've cut that character off from the rest of
civilized society, right?

I have to wonder why Sony bothers with red-named characters.  I think the
initial thought was to prevent the problems that were rampant with Ultima
Online at the time... lots of Player Killers basically making life miserable
for a lot of people.  So they made Everquest's PK system entirely consensual
by allowing people to decide whether or not they wanted to partake of
player-to-player combat.  But because PvP characters could not be buffed by
PvE characters, no one chose to play a "red" character.  I think Sony
thought an entire sub-culture would develop when, in fact, it did not.

They then decided to open the "red" servers, where everything is PvP.  This,
I think, was a good decision, allowing those who really want to play
Everquest in a PvP environment have several servers to chose from.

However, EQ really isn't really a good PvP environment.  It's designed so
much around PvE that PvP is horribly unbalanced.  I really don't know why
PvP players chose to stick it out.  The only thing I can think of is that EQ
is much more stable and has much more content than any of its competition.
Why play a buggy unbalanced no-content-having Shadowbane when you can stick
with EQ?  At least, I think that's the thinking.

Either way, I'll be very interested in seeing what happens with your red SK.
You've basically doomed yourself to soloing through 65.  Every death you
take will be a full-XP death.  You'll never know the joys of Virtue or KEI.
It's a painful and difficult path you've chosen; I salute you.  I wonder if
you'll be able to see it all the way through, though.  =)

Look forward to hearing more about your SK's exploits.
