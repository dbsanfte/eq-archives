Another logical difficulty for you.  Five groups, ten, a hundred, that 
support top posting, don't prove that the majority of groups you visit, 
much less the majority of groups out there on usenet do.  I'm a bit 
confused though, are you also Aruvqan?  Switching from Aruvgan to @ndrew 
midstream has caused me not to respond there, as I'd -like- to note that
the threads you name:

alt.comp.periphs.mainboard.abit
alt.comp.periphs.videocards.ati
alt.internet.wireless
aus.ads.forsale.computers.new
aus.ads.forsale.computers.used
comp.networks
comp.os.-ms-windows.networking.windows
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware.networking

oh and news.soundblaster.com - products.soundblaster.audigy

Don't seem to have anything to do with the posted lists of interests of 
Aruvgan:

historical recreations, novaroma, SPQR, CDC issues [you should read 
morbidity and mortality weekly sometime, amazing data available] hazmat 
issues, health safety law, insurance law, science fiction of several 
different authors, steppes culture [hence the name aruvqan - a 
documentable female name for my sca persona] cooking of various eras and 
areas, the great barrier reef and i like some anime.

And yet you say "They all prefer top posting this is the only anal group 
I subscribe to."

I didn't call attention to this for fear that Aruvgan and @ndrew were 
two different people after all.

Well, most people in this newsgroup are bottom (or more likely 
contextual) posters, most aren't vitriolic, most aren't even in this 
thread.  Those who -are- coming out like rabid pit bulls are the ones 
that come out like that at the drop of a hat, no need to be proved wrong 
as I noted.  Thus, the implied connection ---proved wrong therefore 
profane--- or vice versa ---profane therefore wrong--- doesn't seem to 
hold water.  They could be wrong or right, wouldn't make a bit of 
difference as to whether they were spitting on the floor and calling the 
cat a bastard, nor is the opposite connection demonstrable.

Splendid

ps, thats liberty hall, by the way, a proud sentiment I regret not 
seeing enshrined in modern american politics
