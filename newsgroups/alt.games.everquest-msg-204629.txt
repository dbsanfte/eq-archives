Sadly this is not true in EQ, at least not in the way you seem to
mean.  Yes, there are factions that cannot be repaired at all,
because the only faction hits in the game for them go down, never
up (I think that Tizmak faction in GD is an example).  I don't
have any idea WTF John is talking about, there are a few old
world factions that are one-way, and I cannot recall any of them
being changed when Velious came out.  There are also some that
can only be raised if your faction is already at some minimum
that allows you to do a quest (Enchanters and Bards get a huge
advantage over other classes here, as do races/classes capable
of Sneaking when the min faction is Indifferent or lower).  But,
to take your example of Sir Lucan, while killing him bottoms your
Freeport Militia faction it does not prevent you from raising it
back up again (while I haven't done either, it sounds as if FP
Militia faction, while somewhat onerous to raise from bottom
without trashing other factions, is not as bad as Cabilis for
non-Iksar, probably because it is only one faction).
