That's like asking why can't my shaman cast a 75% slow at level 30,
why do I have to wait until level 51?

Believe me, it may seem that everyone has KEI cast on them all the
time, but it's not really that way. I never get KEI or Temp etc.. cast
on me in PoK. I always need those spells when I group. Of course it's
gotten to a point that people on the level treadmill expect you to
come to the group with KEI and Temp on. I even had a Chanter refuse to
cast Crack on me when I told him I didn't have KEI... Needless to say,
I was shocked.

If you are spending over an hour in any group, you can expect to have
to cast your mana regen spell on them if their KEI fades, and you can
always move over to Firiona Vie and become my personal Crack dealer.
