People get hooked on saftey margin ;) I'd never say a warrior isn't
the absolute *best* tank ever, but I've tanked in ToV and I'm a ranger;
clerics had less mana at the end of it with me than our warlords, but
it worked ;)

Trick is trusting those you're hunting with to do the jobs and picking
up the slack when its needed (MA down, SA LD, Ooops...)

I regularly main tank Chardok and Seb and Maidens. No biggee. At all. 
In fact, I deliberately tease my clerics for CH'ing too early and now 
one has taken to teaching me a lesson by hitting the CH's to get me on 
about a pixel of health.

I am not sure I'd want to do the same in a pickup group though... No
safety margin.
