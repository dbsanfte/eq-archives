Another day another bunch of pseudo "victims" presented to us by the
national media. America's princess Katie Couric has been on a rampage for
years now interviewing these Orwellian "victims" whining and crying about
our hero who took a stand against an out-of-control Federal death squad
while Katie was more concerned about some "celebrities" pregnancy, or
having her anus probed and urging others to join the fun.

Maybe I missed it, but I don't recall our princess interviewing Randy
Weaver or his daughter Sara about their book: "The Federal Siege At Ruby
Ridge: In Our Own Words". I've never seen an interview with Kevin Harris
anywhere. I don't know what he looks like, do you?

Does anyone know what a "Branch Davidian" looks like? If you close your
eyes can you visualize any of the 27 children burned to death by the FBI at
Waco? Have you ever seen their pictures? Have you ever heard an interview
with any of their relatives? Why is it that America's princess has no time
to hear their stories? 

Everyone is talking about "justice" this week but no one is talking to any
of the real victims or their families. When are the Weavers and relatives
of the Branch Davidians going to receive justice for what the FBI has done
to them? When will someone, anyone, from the national media talk to Kevin
Harris?
