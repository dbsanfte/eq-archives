Nope, I had crappy credit. In fact my credit is horrible, with
chargebacks and something like 7,000 in debt. They seemed to only care
that I had a job and was depositing 200 dollars.

What I did here in Nebraska, USA, was get on and search in hotbot
for "VISA checkcard mycityname". I then went to the first bank I saw
that came up and got an account. As far as I know the only thing that
might keep you from an account in the USA is if you have a problem
with A BANK itself on a credit check.
