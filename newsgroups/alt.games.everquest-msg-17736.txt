I spent some time on castersrealm and eq atlas looking on monster
info, there are some low lvl stuff, that is below 10 but very few most
seems to be at 15 and up, the skel you mention would seriously
make my day a bad one :)

I is starting to get harder now to gain xp, eather the monsters are
very weak, or very strong, and i'm not to keen on playing in a group,
the orcs are about 50% green and will give no or very little xp, the
dervs in N ro are some green to, and Dorn B Dynn could also spoile
ones day really bad, i would really hate to get killed and probably
drop back to lvl 14 again, but hunting in lavastorm going for a fire
drake and a medd after that works but the xp is slow.

Thanks for warning me so i didn't have to find out the hard way,
like entering najena and get killed right away *lol*

/Regards Berth
