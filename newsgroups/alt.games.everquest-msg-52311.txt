Actually, to the contrary.  I was getting XP while I was waiting for a
buyer.
I was out hunting stuff when someone did a "WTB HQ bear skins".

So I lost perhaps only a little time of hunting, which was more than paid
for.  The stuff
I am hunting doesn't drop much loot.  I can then use the pp to buy better
armor
or weapons to take on nastier mobs to level up faster.

So this was a no-lose for me.  And hopefully for him.
