While on the subject of EE, there is one that occasionally spawns in the
gorge.  It has pathetic hp (less then 20) but can cast a Disease Spore (or
something like that).  It seems like that thing never goes away, drained
over 900 points of my monk over about an hour.

Eventually had it cured, but very annoying.
