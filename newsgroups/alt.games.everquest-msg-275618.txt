Regarding bards, I would like to point out that I solo'ed quite easily and 
effectively until I hit a brick wall in my upper 50's. By brick wall I mean 
that I went from levelling very fast and easily to just easily. Xp slowed 
way down at that point, but it was still pretty easy to go it alone. I'll 
admit that there may yet have been more places to solo with better xp that 
I was unfamiliar with, however, so I suppose I might have been able to keep 
up the fast pace beyond that if I'd put a little more effort into it.

One thing I *did* realize in about my early 40's was that I hated solo'ing 
for long periods, though I was tempted to do with my bard, as it was so 
effective, but it is booooring.
