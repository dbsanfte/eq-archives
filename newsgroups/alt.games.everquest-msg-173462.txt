No. That was in force well before 9-11. Several times Irish
republicans came to speak in my town, and there was a great deal of
official scrutiny in the 80s and 90s.

This is firsthand for me, because I have worked with direct Catholic
Charities from the US for Ireland and for Timor. We had to make sure
where the money went, and we found by working with the home countries
Bishop directly, we could certify aid quickly.

At a well known University in the US, a professor was taken to task
for supporting an arab terrorist charity well before 9-11.

You really don't know, and your statement was made to create a
strawman.

There are several reasons. I find it hard to believe you have not
heard them, I think you have a conclusion and are tailoring facts to
meet your conclusion.

Innocent civilians. It is not aid it is an inducement to crime. They
bomb to cause terror, unles you claim a dance hall or a bus stop is a
military installation. There would be far fewer homicide bombers with
out foreign aid, but I digress.

Killing combatants, and I agree there has been incidental innocent
victims, that is because the terrorists put their facilities in
apartment buildings and highly populated ares just so they can claim
the innocents as martyrs. Israeli Army unit don't target Palestinean
discos and marketplaces to kill civilians, they are targeting embedded
terrorists.

This too is off topic, you seem to favor the strawman arguements. You
have a conclusion and your facts just seem to fit it, eh?

A few leftists did. Many Israeli people I know serve where they need
to to protect people.
