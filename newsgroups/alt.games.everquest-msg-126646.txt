Or perhaps compelling gameplay reasons. I have a character there, but
I've only played it once or twice.  (Level four troll shammy.) However,
there are people who pretty much *only* play on the Test server. They
have guilds there. One of the posters on Graffe's is a 60 Sorcerer from
a guild on Test.

So I guess that they can't be wiping the characters *that* often, can
they? And if they do, perhaps they just reload the tried and true test
veteran characters from a previous copy?

Just guessing here, but there's more of a society there than some of us
might think. I don't believe they'd have any sixties on Test if they
kept wiping all the characters all the time.

As to why they wouldn't approve the OP's idea.... ok. You have these
(probably small) guilds on Test who've been there all this time doing
VI's dev testing for them. Suddenly, Dark Horizons get's a bug up their
ass and decides to dupe their entire guild over onto Test. They show up
on a friday, run rampant, wipe out everything on the server, wake the
sleeper, etc. etc.

Could be rather disruptive.
