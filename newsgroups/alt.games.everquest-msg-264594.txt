"Centrino" (as far as I can tell) is a total package designed for
on-the-road business use.  It uses a special lower power consumption CPU
(and much lower clock speeds from what I've seen), includes wireless
network, and I'm sure some other things.

If you want to play games on a laptop, you do *not* want a centrino laptop. 
It isn't an "add on" option I don't think, but rather an alternative
CPU configuration option.
