But how likely is Customer Service personel to know this or to have
the time to look it up, or to after having looked it up actually make
a new rule that its ok (which would entail lots more looking up for
everyone to see if the name you want takes into account "non english
.. conventions)? I really doubt if they are linguists or they'd not be
making the 8 or 9 dollars an hour that the full GMS are paid, nor do
they likely have large reference works availible or the time to look
such things up so it comes down to:

"Surnames may contain an accent ( ` ) provided that the division
created does not violate any of the prior policies and provided that
one of the divisions of the name is not a word or breaks up a real
word. This accent is the only non-alpha character that is allowed in
surnames."

The fact that they have a rule against it. In this case perhaps the
person recognizing the word forms worked against you more. If they
allowed what you wanted, they'd have to probably allow Eagle'Heart. A
rule is a rule.

Personally I'd rather have customer service working as fast as
possible and as uniformerally as possible following the rules they
have for exactly that purpose instead of me waiting when I have a REAL
cs problem because a GM is looking up a name you want to see if it
follows non english naming conventions so it can get an ' between two
words while Eagle'Heart can't.
