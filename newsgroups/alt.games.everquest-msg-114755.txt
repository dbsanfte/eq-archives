Guys, if you are still connected and still able to ping the server -- but
just getting a lot of lag -- not able to send or receive enough data keep up
with the 400 other live players, you should be placed in a protected sphere
so you cannot die. This would solve the problem of being punished just be
having a bad route to Verant's servers, and NOT reward those who just unplug
their modems when the going gets tough.
