I would tend to believe that if you quit EQ now and they decided to do a
purge of old accounts that they would stop LONG before getting to your
characters.  After all, after 2.5 years they MAYBE did one Level-One-Only
purge (I can't remember if they ever got around to it).

I'm guessing that if you leave now you've got at least a year to come back.
Of course, I don't work for Verant and you don't know where I live, so if
I'm wrong, tough. :)
