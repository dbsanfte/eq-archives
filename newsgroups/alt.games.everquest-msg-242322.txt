If you're moving when the boat starts to move then there's a pretty good chance
you will move with the boat.

Otherwise, if you have Lev on and Run3 or better then run to the Northwest
immediately when the boat pulls away from the dock. You'll have enough time to
catch up to the boat. Get onboard and you'll zone into Abysmal with the boat.

Once you're in Abysmal the boat will slide out from under you again, so you
might as well just run/swim to the Love Barge from there.
