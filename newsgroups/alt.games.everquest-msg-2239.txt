My friend and I just started Iskars (i'm amonk and he is a Shaman, we love
the combo so far.)

We have just gotten to 9th level and dont have the cash to buy all of his
spells at this level.  Can anyone suggest somewhere to hunt at our levels
that will give a little more profit than FoB. we just aren't getting any
cash.

Thanks
Yartyn, 9th monk
