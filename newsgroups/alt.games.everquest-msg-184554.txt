Past couple of nights I have tried to leave a mule overnight in Bazaar.  Yet
I notice when I look at the PC the next morning that the pc is now sitting
at the desktop.

Checked the log, and saw the last entry was 20 mins after I left my PC.  No
patch message or anything like that in the log.

I have 2 pc's.  AMD 1600 and 2000, both have the same problem.

I haven't been tadering in the bazaar for sometime, but this has been
happening since I started doing this 2 days ago.  Has anyone else had the
same problem ?!!!
