I'm fairly sure reavers are on a 3 hour spawn, and that there's actually 7
spawns, but there were only 6 up because of Rak'Ashiir (who would eat that
trio for lunch fast) and they weren't doing the last reaver in the throne
hall on the sky level because of difficulty in getting there.  However, due
to that same difficulty, they were effectively monopolizing the reavers by
killing the ones that are easy to get to. (as well as the fact that unless
you're really fucking desperate, 1 reaver spawn is not worth the time if you
need a jade reaver)
