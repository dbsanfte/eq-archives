In addition to the factors others have mentioned, what level relative to 
Lenny are the mobs he's trying to shake?

A year or two ago, a friend was running a monk alt with my bard alt, and 
her FD worked very well up until we decided to take a stab at Hill 
Giants while clearly too low level to do them.  Things didn't go as well 
as we'd hoped, which was no trouble, as per plan she dropped to the 
floor while I took over on DOT and run plan... except that the HG stuck 
around to finish her off first.

This happened three times running (we are slow learners, I guess) and we 
finally petitioned, since we were able to /report the lines showing -no- 
"falls down" message, and yet the clearly non casting HG was staying on 
her and hitting quite a few more times.

A GM showed up and told us that this was not a bug, that at low levels 
successful FD is sufficient, but higher level mobs sometimes are able to 
see thru even a successful FD.

He may have been BSing us, but it seemed to fit what we observed at the 
time, with lower level melee mobs, FD without the "falls down" message 
always worked, every time.  But higher level mobs gave us trouble, not 
all the time, but often enough to be noticable.

Splendid
