I never played EQ1 so i'm not sure of the history of SOE. Could someone tell 
me if SOE actual take players opinions into account?

I'm amazed that with all the annoyed solo players out there complaining 
about the lack of solo content and forced grouping that SOE have introduced 
a patch to make it more difficult to solo. It's a really bizzare way to 
treat paying customers and I simply cant work it out.

Surely they must know that WoW is going great in the USA and the European 
release is just around the corner. I have no idea who actually makes the 
decisons on updates etc, but you'd think they would at least acknowledge 
that they have considered the wishes of the community.

Did they do this with EQ1?
