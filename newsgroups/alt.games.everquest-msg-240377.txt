Oh, so this stuff I see on my screen when I play, it is just a figment
of my imagination?  Or maybe it is in fact all hand-painted art made
by billions of gnomes held in slavery in the deepest dungeons of the
SOE stronghold?  I always thought it was my graphics card that
rendered all those polygons, but clearly I was wrong.

By todays standards, Everquest doesn't have particularly good
graphics, that's true.  But Everquest wasn't released today, it was
released in 1999.  Try reading review for Everquest for the time -
they usually praised the graphics, and for good reason, too.
