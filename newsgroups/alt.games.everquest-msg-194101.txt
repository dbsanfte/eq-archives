Is anyone else able to use /bug correctly right now? For some reason I 
can't type in the text window to say what's wrong. Is there something 
I'm not seeing that I have to click on first or something like that to 
be able to use it? Anyways, I'm trying to report that the new DE 
merchant they added to Nektulos refuses to have business with DE's so if 
/bug is working for anyone else, please pass it along.

Kris
