I've never owned an ATI card, so I wouldn't know. But I have heard that 
ATI is pretty bad when it comes to driver support. 

My point was simply that Hercules is at the mercy of another company (the 
chipset maker) when it comes to driver updates.

Hopefully the problems with new EQ rendering engine can be fixed by a 
(timely) driver update. I honestly wouldn't count on Verant doing whatever 
they would have to do to make Kyro II cards work. They probably have 
enough bugs and glitches to worry about with the new rendering engine and 
with Luclin itself, than to spend time trying to implement support for a 
video card that doesn't operate within standard Direct3D specifications.
