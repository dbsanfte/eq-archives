Actually, long term numbers in WoW will be interesting period.

The number of copies sold indicates a large number of people who
didn't previously play MMORPGs are playing, and we don't know yet
whether they will be in it for the long haul. I would guess that
the popularity of the PvP servers comes from folks who played 
multi-player Diablo and Warcraft, and think the only way to get
something similar is on a PvP server.  With battlegrounds coming
and consensual PvP, the PvE ruleset servers may appeal to more
folks after some experience with un-restricted PvP in a MMORPG
environment.
