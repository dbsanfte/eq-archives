My wife has a Celeron 400 with a 4 gig hard drive (only 596meg free) and a
Riva TNT2 video card and 256 memory. She has always played EQ no problems
until tonight. She finally got all the files and got as far as the character
screen but can't get into a world.  It just stops then dumps her to desktop.
Any ideas?  Bigger hard drive? Faster processor?  TIA.
