I melee in a drop dead emergency - i am transiting from point a to point 
b and something agros on me that i dont have to worry about killing me, 
or i am not close enough to zone to lose agro. I have almost never done 
more than a single thwack on a mob in about 5 levels unless i am farming 
tradeskill supplies with the exception of farming my shards in skyfire. 
my husband's shammy and BL and myself...so the shammy cast slows debuffs 
and the like, the pets, bl and myself tanked. was great fun and only did 
it to bring up offense defense and weapon skills in a safe manner=)
