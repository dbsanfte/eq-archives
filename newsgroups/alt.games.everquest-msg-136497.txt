Gah, you must be blind.  I use 3 as my main chat font size, and all my
sub-windows (combat, ooc/auc/shout, officer-chat) are in font size 2.

That's on a 20" at 1024x768 (1280 is stuck at 60hz due to my monitor so I
rarely play at that resolution or higher).

I heard LCDs have problems with games, but haven't owned one yet (partially
due to repeatedly hearing that).  How bad is it with EQ?
