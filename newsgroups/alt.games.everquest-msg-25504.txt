Yup - it's hard to resist isn't it. I replaced my 2 by 64mb sticks of pc100
ram with 3 sticks of 256mb pc133 last week. Only trouble was it had a flow
on effect...

make it socket A as well.
-->Replaced K6-2 500mhz with Athlon Thunderbird 1.2 gigahertz.

So be warned - the upgrade itch is hard to stop once you start scratching
it...=P


PS - the positive side is that now is a very good time to scratch the itch
pricewise, the whole thing only costed me $aus800 ~ which I think when
converted from Australian "pesos" to $US is about $400.
