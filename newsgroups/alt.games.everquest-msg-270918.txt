That worked, they were indeed hiding past the edge of my screen.
In fact, about a tenth of the window was invisible; it was larger than 
my display, and I can't adjust that with this monitor, just slide it 
around to see one part or another; odd because this doesn't happen with 
other games.

Then what I did was change the display setting to the largest one, with 
the 32 setting, and put it on high while I was at it.  I'd used 
conservative settings... in retrospect, silly on a one year old computer 
running a 5 year old game.

Now I see whole screen and it looks twice as good as it did before, nice 
upgrade!


Being able to see the little bars helps a lot.
