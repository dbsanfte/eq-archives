No, you misconstrued what I said. I agreed that it is a common
practice. I just maintain that it is no rule that anyone has any right
to expect followed. I never said or implied otherwise. I normally pay
up front, myself, but not because the porter requires it.

My point is that the porter is not justified in viewing those who
refuse to pre-pay with any contempt. The two of you should either
agree or disagree, but neither case should create ill will. I should
mention, however, that I am in full agreement with you regarding those
who claim they were going to pay more until you required pre-payment.
They are just whiners and, sadly, must merely be suffered on occasion.
Smile and thank them for the reasonable amount they did pay and don't
waste time worrying about what they *said* they were going to give
you. Life's too short. Besides, you can't be cheated out of what they
never gave you in the first place.  :)

I don't know where you go that idea. Your chances of stumbling upon a
crooked porter are just as good as the chances of a porter coming
across a crooked portee.
