Now that you mention it, I haven't seen him post for a while.  Maybe
I should say, I have noticed him posting in a while.  I suppose he could
be posting to threads that I'm not reading. *shrug*

I only have 2 listed in my KF and he's not one of them.  Unless he's
started posting under 'everquestsdabest' or 'Freekey'.  I can't remember
why these two are in there.
