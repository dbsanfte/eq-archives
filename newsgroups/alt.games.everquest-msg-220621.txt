	As a level 40 druid I often travel to the Rathe mountains to
kill hill giants for  experience only to find the zone full of dukes 
and barons squishing them as fast as they pop for the plat.  Now, what 
if a zone like Rathe contained a raid level mob, say, a silver dragon,
that A) ignored players more than N levels (10? 15?) below hers as too puny
to bother with  and B) dropped *absolutely* *nothing*.

	This means that if you're a level 65 player and you need that
critical quest item or NPC conversation you can either find a player of
an appropriate level to get it for you, take your chances with the
guardian, or have your guild kill it with you bearing in mind that they
won't get any loot.  Appropriately leveled players in the zone won't be
bothered by the thing. Farmers would be too frustrated with having to
run from the guardian to farm.

	By controlling how far it wanders you could still leave parts
of the zone like the adventure camps useable to everyone while reserving 
the hunting grounds for people who can use them...

	BTW I don't quite understand the attraction of using your fully AA'd
level 65 whatever to hunt hill giants.  Sure you make a couple of hundred
or a thousand plat, but couldn't you make much more killing something
challenging?  Is this something you just "get" as you grow up, the way
I finally "got" that druids can't really melee? ;-)
