Your examples are perfect reasons NOT to say you are looking for donations.
What if 5 copper pieces is all they have.  What if water to them is very
valuable.  "Reasonable donations" is a very hard thing to approximate and
everyone has a different view of what is reasonable.  That's why I think
people saying they want "donations" are being disingenuous.    Besides it
sounds like we agree as now you say exactly how much you want for the KEI.
