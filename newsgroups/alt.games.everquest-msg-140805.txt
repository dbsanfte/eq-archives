Big question in response to that, how far up have you taken each of the
characters?  A lot of characters don't really "come into their own" until
later levels (when each does is a totally different thread).  If you've only
played to level 20 or so with each of them, then you're missing out on the
larger aspects of the characters.  Now if you have played all the different
classes up to 50+ and still don't enjoy any of them then maybe EQ just isn't
the game for you.

In that case, before anyone else jumps on this
one..............................

Can I have your stuff?
