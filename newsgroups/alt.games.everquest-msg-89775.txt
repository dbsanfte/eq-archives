I am doing the quest in S Karana for Vhalen Nostrolo who needs two
pages of music sheets. You get one for killing the  hermit, and you
have to give cracked flute to bard in I believe N. Karana. Is this
bard at what is now known as the nexus spires? I can't find her. She
is supposed to be near a very large horn structure near the bridge. 
Thanks,
 Linda
