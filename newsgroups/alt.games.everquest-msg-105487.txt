I thought of that too, but I spent too long on a dozen different dirt poor
20/30 something characters, the thought of giving a perfect good lowbie
weapon to a pet is enough to make me cringe still. I haven't fogotten my

curious whether high level mobs would just resist all the stuns or some will
actually get through : )
