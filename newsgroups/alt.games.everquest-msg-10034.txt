All,
    I've been trying to convert as much of my on-hand plat to gems as I can.
Has anybody here been successful at doing it?

    See, it's an old DND trick to carry gems.  They weigh a whole lot less
than plat and are stackable.  Carrying them around during your adventures,
buying them off of folks looting them to lower your weight, and trading them
as currency during a sale all can equal a mobile bank/cash unit.  Ready to
do trading anywhere.

    My question is, "has anyone been successful at doing it?"  Further, has
anyone thought about it like me or attempted doing it?  If so, I'd like to
hear your thoughts on the issue.  Here are some of mine:

- Gem lists with prices.
- Add CHA bonuses/penalties for an average gem price whenever selling them.
- Availability and Rarity of certain gems (like black pearls).  Last, tie
that to the selling price of each to make sure that your trading partner can
liquidate them if they so desire.

Thanks in advance,

-Grim
