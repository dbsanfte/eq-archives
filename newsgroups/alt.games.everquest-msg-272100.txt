That's not quite true, either, IME - in a given zone, they may have
the same loot tables, but the best loot comes from dungeon zones that
often have either no solo encounters at all (Stormhold is like this, I
think), or the solo encounters are hidden beyond lots and lots of
aggro group encounters (Crypt of Betrayal is an example).  And then
there are nameds, which are (always?) group encounters and have better
loot tables.

At least I've never seen anything comparable to e.g. the fused steel
gear from Stormhold drop from non-nameds in Thundering Steppes, and
I've killed quite a few giants there.
