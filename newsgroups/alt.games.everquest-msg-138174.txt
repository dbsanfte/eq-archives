    I actually gave very strict conditions when I sent my tell for it - I
said if anyone had a tailoring skill greater than mine (160 at that time)
and/or was willing to put in the time to raise Tailoring to 250 to be the
guild's tailor that I deferred to them. And they gave me the thing anyways.
So now I can equip them and run around a raid spamming "/em is running with
scissors in her hand! Look out!"

    If you didn't, I'm sure you can tonight. Hey, try and throw off my
timing - we're doing Emperor again! And to make sure you bring your best
stuff: I bought a Heirophant's Cloak with my tailoring sales money this
morning. ;-)
