An exaggeration no doubt ....  if you do go back there farming a
suggestion for you is to buy gems at the gemseller near the inn.  I
have bought rubies from him in the past you lose a little on resale but
can stck the rubies and they weight next to nothing.  Allows you to
stay longer in zone ... if you feel so moved o)
