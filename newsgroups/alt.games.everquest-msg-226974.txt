Let me put it this way, for elemental raids, in our public raiding group
there are only three classes that will be raided in if they do not have the
flags to participate.  Clerics, Druids and Shaman.   Only once have I ever
seen them ask for another class, which was a bard.  (Guess that specific
target really needed resists)

Mass Group Buff + Spirit of the Wood = powerful AE heal over time.  And a CH
that fits in quite well.

I guess I can't really speak to Time level guilds, but for Elemental Planes,
druids are highly desired raiders.
