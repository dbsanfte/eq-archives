I'll third the motion played DAoC and it was just EQ with rule tweaks.
You really needed to have your panties in a bunch over EQ rule x,y, or
z (soloing being the one I heard most) and trade skills to want to
quit EQ for this and I know a few who went to DA for that reason. It's
hardly better, just different and very EQ like. Quit after two weeks.
