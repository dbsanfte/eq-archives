But...the person giving the account away DID spend 29 bucks on the software,
it's not a lost retail sale.

If I go out and buy a video tape for $10.00 and decide I don't like the
movie, so give it to a friend...MGM isn't out $10.00, they got it when I
bought the movie.

I'm not saying selling accounts is right...but sweet bejeebus, if you spend
3 or 4 years or so playing this game, and you'd rather give it away than
destroy 4 years of effort, it shouldn't be such an issue.

By this thinking...after you pay for your vehicle, and you want a new one,
you should destroy your old one instead of using it as a trade in.  Heck,
you're cheating the car company out of thousands of dollars by trading in
your old one.  After all, it was their intellectual property that designed
the vehicle.
