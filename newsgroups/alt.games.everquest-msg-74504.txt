Biggest problem I have with "name nazis" is that they pretty much demand we
have names with no meaning.  May as well just give everyone a random name.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.

Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
