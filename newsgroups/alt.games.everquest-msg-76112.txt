Yep.  He should quit.

If going from level one to level two takes too long to develop for his tastes,
then the game will only get worse for him.   Level 1 to level 2 took my
(completely untwinked) beastlord less than an hour.   And it only took that
long because I was trying to do the newbie armor quests.  (and find my trainer
in Halas : P)

Might also want to switch servers, if they want to try and continue the game.
Playing with friends is the most important part.  Also isn't the "roleplaying
encouraged" server Firona Vie?  The one with the sucky ruleset, like you have
to spend hours learning languages before you can interact with other players?
