Dont tell me the same idiot children who populated oasis and loio have
made it into the late 50's and still dont know the benefits of crowd
control? Are clerics simply about rezzing only? No, a heal is nice
too. Same goes for enchanters....mana regen isnt the end all of the
class. The most xp ive received in a group has been from mass pulling
and crowd control (provided the tanks are eeediots). Why level a
enchanter to 60 and then sit on your butt in bazaar dishing out KEI
all day? Sort of like working all your life in backbreaking labor only
to retire to a park bench tossing cans of green beans at the pidgeons.
