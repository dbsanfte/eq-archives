You'd be amazed at peoples ability to deceive themselves. For a while
my response to 'What gender are you in rL?' was 'Does it really matter?',
followed by 'Just assume Im actually a puppy with a huge special keyboard'
developing into 'My name is bob and Im a 50 year old trucker from
grimsbury with acne.' into 'Im a guy, ok?'

People will take any excuse to believe you are that nubile 21 year old
playboy model, and then hold you accountable for their sexual frustrations
and delusions.
