But the consensus seems to be that "raids aren't about exp", so at
least sharing it out eliminates exp during raids as a source of
jealousy and bickering.

I thought that was pretty stupid, go to the trouble to make loot
control sensible, and then make it next to useless for the most
interesting raids (those that involve valuable NODROP loot).

Most of your complaints seem to be the "usual suspects" type of
stuff about bugs, but the loot rules thing looks to me to be an
inadequately thought-out feature.  They should do it as you say
and eliminate "public" looting of raid targets.  If a raid wants
to let an outsider get something that would rot they, can add
that person to the raid long enough to pick it up.  This would
also let "regular" groups choose to accept smaller exp in order
to secure the corpses of their kills, which would be worthwhile
when hunting primarily for loot rather than exp.
