Specialization is the ability to cast spells with lower usage of mana
and less chance of fizzling. It does not make you cast faster, nor
increase the chance of recovery from interruptions.

You can only specialize in one casting discipline - so chose wisely.
Once specialized you'll have to do a certain quest to 'remove' your
specialization.

You specialize by training one point in each of the specialize
disciplines, and then move on by casting spells from the discipline
you wish to specialize in.

When the desired specialize dicipline reaches skill 50, you have
specialized in that dicipline. From that point on none of the other
specialization diciplines will rise above 50.

As a druid; two good choices are conjuration, for DoT's, and evocation
for DD spells. The actual choice depends on your preferred type of
playing.

Good Luck
