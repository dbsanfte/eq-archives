You're <assuming> that the reduction in Monk AC "effectiveness" will be
large enough to have that effect.  Now I'm not quite stupid enough to
claim that VI won't do that, but I'm wondering if it'll stay that way
even if it starts out like that.  Given the level of complaining that's
occurring based on speculation, I'd expect the "real" screaming when
the change goes live will be quite a show if the effects game out as
badly as you're expecting.

You don't yet know that that is how it's going to be.

So you're saying the real issue is getting stunned, and you expect that
to be a much more frequent occurrence after this change?
