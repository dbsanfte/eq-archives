I generally avoid anybody with a name that starts with "Guard" unless
I'm doing it for faction. (I'm now kindly in N. Freeport thanks to the
deaths of countless hundreds of Freeport Militia guards, but they were
almost all green.) Guards tend to be buffed up to the point of being a
*very* tough fight for anyone who could get any useful xp off of them.

That said, there are some decent ones. There's even a pair you can camp
that won't give you a bad faction hit. If you go to Lake Rath, and turn
right when entering from the SK zone line, follow the coast and you'll
come to a cove with an old guard tower there.  There are two human
guards who protect this empty and apparently pointless tower. They are
far enough apart that they can be single pulled. Hit pretty hard, but
doable in the mid twenties when you might still get xp. Still a tough
fight though, and there's much easier xp out there to be had.
