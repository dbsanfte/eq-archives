The PoP cds only have original EQ and PoP.  You'd need to buy kunark, 
velious and luclin outside of this, along with LoY.

The Gold pack has all the expansions up to and including PoP.

The way it works is that you buy your new cd keys, start up EQ from the old 
install, and go in just like you had just installed a brand new copy to 
register a new username linked to your new cd keys.
