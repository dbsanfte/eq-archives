Netscape 6.0 should never have been released. It has ruined their 
reputation and I think it will take a while for them to earn it back. 
Netscape 6.2 was much improved and Netscape 7 is damn good.

Yes and yes (Counter-Strike). Take a look at http://www.transgaming.com/

They develop WineX which emulates a direct X environment to run Windows 
games. Unfortunately EQ won't work, since the last time I checked WineX 
only emulates DirectX 8.0 and EQ uses 8.1, and the EQ patcher uses 
Internet Explorer :/ Many other Windows games do work however, and with 
pleasing performance.

I think Mandrake 8.X comes with WineX already, but I've only tried it 
under Debian.

WINE itself still needs a lot of work until it can be considered 
reliable. It has come very far over the years but its still not good 
enough in a production environment.

One of the other benefits of using Mozilla/Netscape is that it is cross 
platform, so you can use it under both Linux and Windows.
