    I do only have the one level's worth of fighting there, but in my
experiences the Truesilver is an uncommon drop on the mobs it drops from.
Key words - the mobs they drop from. Most of the pieces only drop off a
given rare spawn, and are NOT random off the mobs listed on EQMaps (at least
not when I got their spawn-loot printout). I let enough Sleeves rot to
believe that. The sad thing is, I've seen a bunch of the other, more
out-of-the-way pieces on FV vendors. 8(
