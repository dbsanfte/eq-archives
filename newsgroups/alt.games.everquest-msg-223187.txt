Just bought a 2nd hand copy of Everquest Deluxe Edition - complete with maps
and "fugurerine". Paid quite a bit for it as well.

Of course when I enter the "key number" it tells me that the key has already
been used. Well of course it has - but it isn't being used by the previous
owner now.

Is there any way that I can actually use the original version of Everquest
I've just bought or have I bought something useless?

Gareth.
