Mobs in the sewers of Nihilia hit for 1100-1300+, but they have way
less HP than (for instance) a Kriger in BoT.  They appear to give about
2.25% of an AA per kill in a 6 man group.  They are easily taken with
an 8khp tank, 50% slow and a cleric.  Far easier with a better tank
and my new 65% slow (40k and well worth it)

I haven't done an exhaustive check of mobs in other zones, but I know
the zone in mobs in Barindu only hit for 570ish (think PoV golems).
