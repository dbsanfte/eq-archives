Nope. Full time job, plus some consulting side work. Married. House, mortgage,
etc.  I also often have evenings where I only have an hour or so to play, or
weekends that get eating up with other stuff and I can only log on for a little on
Sunday night.  I guess I just am paranoid about having a corpse lying out there. I
like finishing the session with all my stuff on me, and camped in a relatively
"safe" spot. Your mileage may vary. If I die right before I was going to log, I
just stay up a little later.
