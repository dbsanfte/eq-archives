What's weird is that Mythic is doing the same thing with DAoC.  It seems
kind of odd that both Sony and Mythic decide in the same week to do this.

Here's what Mythic said about it:

    "Even before we launched DAoC many of our players asked us to allow a
    windowed mode for DAoC. The reasons were of course varied, and many of
    them were compelling. However, they were not compelling enough for us to
    officially activate that mode. As DAoC has evolved and grown over the
    past year, the requests for this mode by players have increased, not
    decreased, over time. Once again, the players are putting forward
    compelling reasons, and once again we are faced with a tough decision.
    This time however we might be willing to take a chance where we werenï¿½t
    before. With a fully trained CSR staff and anti-cheating methods that
    have been expanded and refined over the year, we are willing to listen
    very carefully to the DAoC community on this issue. If the majority of
    our community feels strongly enough to let us know that it favors having
    the ability to run DAoC in a windowed mode, we will enable it for DAoC.
    This change will also allow people who are running DAoC full screen to
    alt-tab and DAoC will be properly minimized to the taskbar. There are,
    of course, a few caveats here."

The caveats are just that they will do it on the test server for a while
first, and only go live if it is safe, and that it will only work initially
with the Shrouded Isle client.

Sony doesn't say why they are adding windowed mode, at least on their notes
at the Developers Corner.  The most interesting thing they say is that they
have reversed the account bans that were due to third-party windowing
software.  That's interesting because I'd never heard of anyone being banned
*only* for EQW.  Everyone I've seen whining that they got banned for EQW has
turned out to have been doing *other* things, like ShowEQ, or speed hacks,
while using EQW.
