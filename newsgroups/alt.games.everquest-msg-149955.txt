I used to play a long time ago (played for a year and a half) but no
idea where the boxes with cd keys are but have the kunark and velious
cd's. Anyway if anyone is bored with their eq account or have too many
let me know how much you want for it. Note that I don't care how many
characters the account as. I'd rather start a new character.
Appreciate it better when I earned the levels. 

Can reply in email.
