StackedAndPacked Receptionist looks your way apprehensively -- looks kind

Glug, glug, glug...  StackedAndPacked Receptionist takes a swig of Potion

StackedAndPacked Receptionist judges you amiably -- looks like a reasonably 
safe opponent.
You say, "Hail, StackedAndPacked Receptionist"
StackedAndPacked Receptionist says, "Welcome to my deshk, handshome 
shtranger. I'm not feeling well, could you [take me to bed]?"

You have gained experience!
