Here is a little story I read on everlore, I'm sure we can all relate to
it...  He refers to Vekis in FV.

-----
I remember a guy like this. It was a long time ago back in Gfay. I saw a
cool wolf in wolf form. I follow the wolf. The wolf was white. The wolf took
me to the bank. The bank had people at it. People caused lag. My computer
slowed down. During the lag i was teled to the "Safe Spot." It wasnt very
safe. First i teled to Nagfen's Lair where i was killed instanly, Aftered
that i teled to another safe point where i was killed by Vox, then a gm came
to me and killed me. Then said i exploited a bug and band me. Why all this
happened i don't know, but back to the story. I was in Black Burrow when a
gnoll started shouting something in gnollish. I quickly jumped up to Halas
and went to my guild leader. The leader helped me to learn gnoll a little. I
leveled at icy orcs till i got more level. When i got more levels i got more
skill points. I went to the guild leader and practiced my gnollish. I went
back the Black Burrow. They thing had despawned. I waited there until it
respawned. Sadly it took a long time. To pass the time i killed a scrawny
gnoll at the zone first off. Then later i moved a little deeper and took a
Gnoll. then i came across a burly gnoll. It wasnt too burly. I killed it
using my splintering club and a root. BTW i am a Shaman. Thats why my guild
is in Halas. I then found some giant snakes to kill. They are like level 11.
I killed them for about an hour then moved on to bigger game. I killed the
COMMANDER! I soloed him actually! I was so excited i ran out of black burrow
and went straight over to my Euidite buddies. They never get any action over
there so i ha to bring some fun. This is where is all comes together. This
is where the plot thickens. I learned of the new Warrens zone. I could not
find it and happened to zone into the Hole. Guess what... Another safe point
tele. This time i went to VP. I was scared at first but when i finally took
a step-Boom. I was teled to Mayong Mistmore's Magic Musiuem. It was were all
the mobs who got taken out of the game went. I was a strange occorance for
me to go there. I was happy and sad for teh mobs all at the same time. I
cried, i lughed... I got intouch with my spiritual self. Then another GM
came. I was instantly killed, lost my corpse and bound at Lord
Degihjsfpsdjgeiorhjfoiwg's Lair. I was blasted repeatedly over and over and
died over and over. I had a corpse pile up to the celing. I was knocked from
level 58 to level 46. Row anyone who thinks they have died more than that
please send me a tell on Sol ro server. I would love to chat sometime. I am
a slow typer but i can be nice to talk to sometimes.
