you really should read something on that quest in more depth.  I finished
that quest and you have to camp bixies at towers if I recall corectly.  any
lone bixie not at the right location doesn't have a chance to drop that
quest piece.  have to be at the right location.  and I don't remember the
right location, look it up.  running around looking for solo's won't cut it.
and I do remember it was in misty thicket zone near halfling city.
