Plus that only leads to bad feelings.  We had the rule that you
needed /pet discipline to use pets on raids, and we got no flack
from new pet owners about it because it was applied evenly (IE -
despite my long membership in the guild and close relationship with
several officers my BL didn't get to use a pet until I got it
for him.)

Basic rules 

1. pay attention
2. pay attention
3. immediatly /pet hold when you see "You get raid experience"
4. anytime you can't remember if you hit /pet hold, hit it.
5. wait for assist to be called
6. ONLY then do you send in your pet
7. PAY ATTENTION TO PET POSITIONING!  Both for push and to keep it
   from eating an enrage.

Did I mention pay attention yet?

People who didn't follow some variation of these rules got a warning
then TL'd out if they didn't pay attention.
