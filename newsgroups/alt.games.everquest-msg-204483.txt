Actually they do.  I have a trader I leave up, and while I'm watching him I
see people come up browse and leave.  I am the only one in the stall, and
the closest trader is not close enough to cause a mis-click.

I've done this as well.  look up an item, find the trader, browse their
wares, find the item, then change my mind last minute, or do one last /baz
search and find it cheaper and go to that trader instead.
