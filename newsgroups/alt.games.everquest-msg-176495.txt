Well that's kind of why I asked here.  My take from the warrior board I
visited was that most people keep hitting the taunt button but there were a
few opinions posted with the opposite view and that sounded like they were
experienced and certain.  But without cites.  Same thing we are getting
here.  The vote goes to button mash, the 'experts' say only as needed, and
no-one can show proof.
