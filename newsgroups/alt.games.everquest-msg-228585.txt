Check Caster's Realm.  Necros get Reclaim Energy at level 1.  And 
Cavorting Bones, the first Nec pet.  Why don't necros use it to "boost 
mana"?  Because it gives back "a percentage of mana required to cast that 
pet."  Same for the Enchanter, with the pet spell being Pendril's 
Animation.  Relly not that hard to find the info, if you look.
