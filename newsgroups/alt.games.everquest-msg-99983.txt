Was in ToV earlier tonight with one hell of a lot of people there
and all worked very well for the entire day.  I did not use new
models at all though.  Tried them later for a short solo stint in
LOIO with my Necro and all seemed ok, but not as good as not using
them so I am just going to resign myself to no new models and be
happy with what I got.
