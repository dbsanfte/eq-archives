   Hmmm...it shows up right in Explorer.  Is it not showing up right in
whatever newsgroup reader you are using?  Or did you look at the source 
and see that I've used some inelegant coding?  I could place a semi-colon
after every &nbsp I have, but I also feel that if something isn't broken,
don't fix it.

  So. From where you sit, it is broken?
