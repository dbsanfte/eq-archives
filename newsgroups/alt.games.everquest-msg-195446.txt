This is not a bad idea at all - 40k can allow all 4 of those
characters to be vastly overpowered for the 1st 20-30 levels
of their life, leading you to level to quickly (leaving skills
untrained) and causing a lack of understanding of how to use
their abilities.

OTOH - if you're very sure about playing either the clr,sk or
necro to a high level you might ask your friend about helping
you get traveller's boots or journeyman's boots - they boost
running speed somewhere around 30%.  The convenience factor of
this is HUGE.  It dramatically increases the enjoyment of playing
and allows you to use some tactics that are otherwise not
available.

BL's don't need them, as they get Spirit of Wolf at 30.  Prior
to that you can make do with a few 10packs of SoW potions
(available in the bazaar, usually).

What he can do is help you after you've gained levels yourself.
I helped my buddy along with small boosts everytime he got to
levels where things slowed down - rather than all at once at the
beginning.
