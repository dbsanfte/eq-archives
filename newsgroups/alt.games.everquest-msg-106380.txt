Actually, the reason I went down this path in the first place is that
I got annoyed at people saying "Why should druids want to be more
useful in high end raids, they are the best soloers so they should
just go solo instead" and similar tripe. My point was that a class
like shaman is extremely useful on raids AND an extremely capable solo
class, and the people bitching about druids here and telling us to
just go solo seem to not be able to see that one ability does not
negate the other, and that solo ability is no good excuse to keep from
giving druids slightly more raid usefulness.
Note that you won't see my name on that petition. I'm not campaigning
for the petition, I am campaigning against druid bashers.
