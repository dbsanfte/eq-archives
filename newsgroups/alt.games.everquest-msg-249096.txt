Out of four raiding orgs on test two folded completely within the last
month. The remnants were absorbed by the other two. And even with
that, both orgs find themselves calling off raids from time to time to
non-attendance, and both were forced to do a full backflagging run
which they are still in the midst of.

"Bad enough when the dead come walking," he said to Jon as they crossed
 the village, "now the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will
 come of *that*, I'll warrant. And who's to say the bones wouldn't lie?
 Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely
 dull fellows, full of tedious complaints - 'the ground's too cold, my
 gravestone should be larger, why does *he* get more worms than I do....'"
