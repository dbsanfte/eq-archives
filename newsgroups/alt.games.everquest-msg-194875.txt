I know you said you wouldn't be going to the bazaar, but you might do a "/auc
new player WTB velium weapon" in Fay sometime.  I used to give out velious
weapons to newbies, but these days most newbies seem to have better!  A player
will get around 6 plat for one from a vendor, you shouldn't have to pay more
than 10.  (They drop off mobs in Kunark, too high for your level).
