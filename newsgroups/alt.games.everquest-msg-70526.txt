Not really a relationship between the two paragraphs except just giving 2
reasons why I'm not too thrilled with the new cleric.

The problem is that the gems are for reimbursement for the cost of the
reagents...NOT as payment for services and NOT a gift.  He's not entitled to
even 1p over cost.  He is entitled to ONLY the cost of reagents.

I have no problem with a cleric who makes a small profit, but FOUR HUNDRED
PERCENT profit?  That's an OUTRAGE.  I'm not hunting with him to help him
buy his next useless piece of equipment...not when I have 5k in the bank of
my level 55 character and 100p on my 52.
