that would be a Shadowknight

its a necromancer/warrior hybrid that sucks a whole lot less than all the

As far as sk's go, my recommendation is to play a dark elf as strength items
are extremely easy to come by so thats not a problem, night vision, natural
hide, high intelligence, and they arent fat pigs with speech impediments <g>
