Not a biggy, but I like it.

If you're in a guild you should know, if you read the patch messages, that
there's a new guild command.   That command is "/who GUILD".

/who all GUILD (or /who GUILD all) gives you a list of all NON-/ANON guild
members online.  It DOES show /roleplaying guild members.

/who GUILD gives you a list of all guild members IN YOUR ZONE.

The possible bug is that, although /who all GUILD doesn't show /anon folks,
/who GUILD does (assuming they're in your zone).

I'm guessing this may be related to the condition where you don't see
someone's new level unless you're in their zone, or if they zone.
