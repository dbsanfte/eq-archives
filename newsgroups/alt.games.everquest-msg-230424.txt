I've seen the same effect from time to time in Dulak.

After asking around, I think I've found a possible explanation; when I 
have this problem, I'm on drogmar back.  On a mount, you don't stop 
instantly, you tend to slide a bit.  Apparantly if you try to loot while 
still moving, it can gum up the works.

Sometimes this problem clears up after a minute or two, other times you 
have to log out to clear it.

As a mage, logging out means losing a pet, along with his haste buff, 
his gear, and if (as is frequently the case) I'm grouped with someone 
else, any buffs they've put on him.

So, I've tried hard to make certain I've stopped well and good, and 
remained stationary for a bit, before looting.  This seems to have 
solved the problem for now... except when I slack off and loot without 
paying attention to the niceties.

Oh, its worst on the stairs, which is logical because its hardest to 
stop moving on stairs.

And I've had the problem a couple times in Velks... where its possible I 
was sliding on ice while trying to loot.  Had the Velks trouble before 
finding out about this possible explanation, so I wasn't paying 
attention to whether this was actually the case.
