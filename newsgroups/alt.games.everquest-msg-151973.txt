I agree with your formula (as I've always used it) and in the low 20's it's
pretty much spot on...after that though, as you say, there are other
modifiers I imagine to do with your attack stat but possibly level related
(like the caps at 10 and 20) who knows. Copelands seemed to be pretty close
to the mark (I think that was before the last 2hder revamp) I wonder if
anyone knows what formulae that uses.
