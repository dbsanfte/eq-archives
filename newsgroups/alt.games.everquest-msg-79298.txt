> Plenty of stuff ingame to kill, WHY do people do this??

Because they're losers who have no idea how to be original.  They follow a
script....they go to <this> zone from 1-5, then <this> zone from 6-14, then
<that> zone from...etc...on EVERY CHARACTER, because they were told that's
the thing to do.  They have no idea what it's like to have friends with any
more depth than they themselves have.

They're losers.  They believe that you have the right to be losers and,
well, they're right, they do.  Don't be angry, pity them instead.  I mean,
heaven forbid they should be required to THINK, right?  That's too much to
ask.

Pity them.
