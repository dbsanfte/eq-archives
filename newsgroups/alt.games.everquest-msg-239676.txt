Wouldn't say he was smart for almost conquering Europe.  His generals
may have been smart but there are many occasions where he overrode
them to his cost ... luckily for us!

As for battle tactics that would have been his generals alone.

Examples:
- Picking on Russia for one
- Orderring the luftwaffe to turn from the airfields to London during
the blitz

Sounds dumb to me.
