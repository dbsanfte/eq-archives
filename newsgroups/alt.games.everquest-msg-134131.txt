person)

3.Ram: 512mb of 1066 rdram(if i go with xp maybe 1 gig,not sure)

4.Motherboard:Not sure yet,it needs to support 1066rdram and not have
anything
                         down on mb like(sound or video)

5.Video card:Geforce 4 4600(128mb)  or new Ati 9700(128) any help here too.I
                       know nvidia drivers have been better than ati in the
past.

6.Sound card:Sound blaster gamer(cant remember the correct name)

7.Hard drive: Western digital special edition drive with 8mb cache(100 or
120 gig)
