The way I think most people do it is to have ZA up, run EQ, end task it 
or kill it, maybe even restart.  eq.exe should be in ZA's program list, 
check allow internet/server.  That should get you past the login screen. 
   You then need to log in, join a server, and you should go LD as soon 
as you get in, alt-tab out at this point, and eqgame.exe should be in 
the list now, give it the same privileges and you should be set.  GL to ya.
