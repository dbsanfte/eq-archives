When would EQ2 likely start beta testing? I wasn't in on beta testing the
original, but know someone who was. I think it would be an enjoyable
experience.  Would they likely open it up to the public (more like the first
one) or be more like Luclin and only accept those who have done it for them
in the past?

Question to anyone who did beta test the pre-release EQ: Did you ever screw
up your system badly or just EQ? How often did you actually play? What kinds
of things did they want you to do or to try to break? Did they ever twink
you in any way, like give you extra plat or items needed to test specific
things?
