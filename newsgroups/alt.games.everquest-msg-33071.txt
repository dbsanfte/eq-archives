Thanks a lot. The ' alt ' was the key I was looking for.

I didn't try it with the 1st F9 [ looking at the top of my head ]
but the second bum cam which is at ground level was able
to be changed with alt + scroll up [ scroll down ]. That changed
the pitch for me and made it perfect.

So thanks again, and thanks to all who responded to my question.

Now if only I could kill a bat, I'd be the baddest level 3 in the game. :-)
