It all depends what the purpose is.  When my shaman had stalled at level 
26 for a while, a level 39 warrior friend, and a level 45 cleric friend 
took me to mistmoore, the warrior grouped, the cleric not, and PLed me 
for a while by killing easy mobs for the warrior that were quite red to 
me.  In general though, I stick with approximately the same level 
groupmates, and go out and have fun somewhere level appropriate.

That being said, you must be no lower than 2/3rds of the level of the 
highest groupmate in order to get xp.
