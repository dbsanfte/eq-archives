I would imagine that crafted armour will suit you just find till level
40.  Isn't that the warrior's equivalent of Lambent Armor for Bards? 
I'm still wearing my Lambent Armor at 42 but I'm looking to replace
those pieces with Acrylia armor or Singing Steel.  You may want to
consider Acrylia armor for your warrior once you get to around 40,
unless you want to shell out the plat for it now.

I'd love to have a full suit of Singing Steel but it will be a long
time till I can get into a raid for the Breastplate and other more
expensive pieces.  I see a lot of bards running around with the
Singing Steel boots and Gauntlets, but I've never seen one with the
breastplate or leggings.  They must be rare.  Anyone here have them?
