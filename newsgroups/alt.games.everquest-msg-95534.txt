No that would be an idiot Mage.

Adds at the low levels are no big deal if you have full mana you just use AE spells.
I can AE 3 mobs easy, I do it  all the time. If you are at the higher levels or low on
mana at the low levels an add is time to run to the zone as your pet valiantly sacrifices
itself for you. Usually I am at full health when I hit the zone because I run early
if I even have a hint of an overpull or an add.

I'll take your word for it, since I am not there yet. I believe you.

Well the whole key to soloing is mob selection. Much better
in my opinion to take down several low easy blues than one
that's higher level and more difficult.

I leveled fast because I always tried to kill blues, lots and
lots of blues. Even tho I could take reds, yellows, and whites
quite easily. Reason being is that while the higher con may give you
more exp per kill the down time from the kill would be too great. I
could kill many more blues and surpass the red's experience in
the same amount of time. Also fighting higher cons is more dangerous
and will kill your pet and make you run to the zone, which results in
even more downtime and perhaps death.

Besides if you are talking about the wyverns in CS those
things suck for exp. Need to find better.

Yes but we *ARE* talking solo here. So the grouping of the monk
is irrelavent.

Well you will just have to drop down to one of the 49 pets.
Yes damage will be lower but it wont be pissing off the melee
people or the cleric that has to heal them.
