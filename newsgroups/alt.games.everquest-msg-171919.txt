I've recently been obtaining essences in Skyfire for a guildmate.  Both the
Chromodracs and Mature Chromodracs drop them, but it is fairly rare.   As
far as farming these guys, they seem to be a pain in the arse as they
constantly dispel everything you've got on you.  If there are better sources
for farming them I would definitely look for them.  The numbers you stated
for the Faerie Dragons in Wakening Lands sounds about the same as the
Chromo's, 1 in 10.
