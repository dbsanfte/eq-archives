I don't know...but I have a suggested location that might be interesting:
Nathyn's building in Katta.  There are two guards out front, and two guard
sonic wolves, and two more guards in the first room inside, and a couple
more past that.  Their faction is opposite that of the rest of the Katta
guards, so as long as you don't want to do the quest that involves talking
to Nathyn, there are no faction problems.  If the Katta merchants will deal
with you, there are merchants one building over that you can sell the heavy
swords and shields to (and if not, there is a bank down the ramp you can
dump that stuff in to sell in another zone).

I just did the outside ones and the first two inside ones as a Wizard, doing
the wolves as a pair, and then the two outside and one inside guard as a
triplet.  By the time I'd med after one of those kites, the other would be
up.  You and your partner would have less downtime, but I think with the
other inside ones (and the ones in the hidden rooms, which we can find by
walking around outside of the building and looking in the windows), and the
ones upstairs (but don't get too close to Nathyn....he is very nasty), you'd
have plenty.

It would be interesting to see what the XP is like for you, taking into
account the convenience of merchants right there and a bank nearby to unload
loot on, so you don't have to take a serious break from killing when you get
loaded.
