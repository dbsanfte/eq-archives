Yep.  I have yet to have a chance to try him since realizing he was
blue to me at 35 but I suspect he is still a decent undercon.

He is up there with inkies like Dorn in Northern Ro and Kizdean Gix
(reknown to be Zytl's cousin) on the list of retribution kills.

I have openly sworn to Zytl 100 deaths to him for every one of mine
and for his shame, many will be at the hands of naked newbies.  I
believe I owe him 900=)
