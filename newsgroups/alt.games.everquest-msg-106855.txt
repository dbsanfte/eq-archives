Hmmm, I'm pretty sure they were shrooms, but we were pulling anything but 
the bugs.  I'm never ML, so I only noticed when the bard spells were 
handed to me.  It's quite possible that the spells dropped off of other 
mobs.

Yeah, done these guys, they're not bad.

Heh-heh.  We camped there too.  I like killing the stuff other than 
shrooms.  We were ranger ranger bard cleric for most of the time, and just 
pulled 2-4 at a time and killed them as then came.  The snare is a bitch, 
especially when you get snared on the pull and get beat on all the way 
back.  It's at least fun.  Are the Deep Lotus plants hard?  We killed them 
when they spawned, but didn't really look for them.  Seemed the same as 
other similar level mobs, but maybe starting with slow helps a lot.  :)

Yeah, haven't killed those.  Don't want the faction issues.  If there were 
a way to counter-act the faction hits, I'm sure we would add those to our 
pull cycle too.

Haven't done this yet, but 6 mobs every two minutes could be fun.  What 
level are the mobs?  If they are similar level to dogs in Velks, this 
could be great fun.  My guild has sent groups to do this, but not since I 
upgraded my computer.

Yeah, but I never seem to be on when a guild AE group forms.  It's really 
annoying too, since bards have some really, really nifty AE pulling songs.  
On the few occasions that I've been able to be puller, we've had great fun 
and better exp.

I can solo shrooms pretty easily, but I just don't enjoy grinding the exp 
there.  I don't mind guild groups, and I have fun there, but it just never 
seems as fun as HS or Chardok or Velks Pit or Umbral.  I think I just find 
fighting mushrooms boring.  /shrug
You have given me more possible places to play there, and I suspect my 
guild will be doing more and more Luclin, so it is convenient.  I think I 
need to get over my shroom block, so I'll give it a try the next time I 
want to grind exp and am bored.
