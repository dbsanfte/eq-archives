I have never seen anything override low health aggro.  If you're on
the mob's hate list and your health drops too low it will move
mountains to try and finish making you dead (well, okay, mobs can't
actually modify the landscape, so it'll either summon you through
the mountain, if it can, or warp on top of you if it can't find a
path to you, or just move to you as fast as its cute little mob
feet can carry it).

It's also worth noting that some mobs pay a lot more attention to
proximity than others (most undead are easily distracted by a target
in melee range), some mobs don't seem to care all that much about
sitting (lowbie mobs in particular, seen many a caster sit at a
Crushbone or Deathfist Orc's feet while the melees pound on it),
while some mobs have a special dislike for PCs who dare to sit in
their presence (Faydedar is legendary for this).
