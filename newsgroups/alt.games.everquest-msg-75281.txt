May sound a bit strange, but put a fast weapon in your primary hand and the
wurm in your secondary, the speed of the dual wield style seems to be
dictated by the speed of your primary weapon and you may be loosing a lot of
damage potential with your present set up.  Once your dual wield is high you
should be hitting a good bit with your off hand anyway and the additional
speed you get with the faster primary weapon should make up with the damage
you loose by moving the wurm.  By the way what level is your ranger, as a
lot depends on that and the skill level of you dual wield.
