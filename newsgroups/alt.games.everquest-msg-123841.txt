Outlandish ideas get dropped. Why waste time and
energy investigating them? People have all sorts
of strange ideas and delusions... you cannot
expect scientists to investigate every claim some
nutcase makes.

Why is it the people that believe in this stuff,
cannot find any proof?

> Just because our rigid notions of what is science, and what

Many scientists have tried to prove the existence
of the soul, so far all have failed.

Yes, it may exist, but then again, God may be a
mollusc living in a rock pool.

If you have any any proof of this bio-kinetic
energy, let us hear it. You may be eligible to win
a million dollars.

>only that our modern society is too
>narrow-minded to study it.

It comes from experience and the use of scientific
method. 

Should we still be sifting around in the entrails
of animals, seeking to find our answers?

Would you have every scientist in the world
wasting their time, trying to find out if the
world is supported on the back of an invisible
turtle?

After all, can it be proved that it isn't so?

And, the current crop of psychics, astrologists,
ufologist, creationists, and other assorted
loonies, behave as if science had never advanced
since the era in which those words were written.

You wouldn't have to have been here 10,000 years
ago, to be sure.

No, its not possible. Not possible at all.

The age of the earth isn't based just on carbon
dating. And, it doesn't have to be exact to
confirm that the age of the earth is greater than
10,000 years. When you are talking about timespans
of 100 million years, a million years plus or
minus is of no great import.

I heard a creationist scientist (an astronomist),
trying to explain how the light from stars that
were millions of light years away actually got
here, if the universe were less than 10,000 years
old. He wasn't really sure, but he didn't go along
with the common creationist theory that God
created the information contained in that light
'in situ'.

As the previous poster said... "Fucking
frightening"

You can believe whatever you wish, but that
doesn't make it so.

Where's the proof?

You are not referring to scientists only, are you?
