So billing the Mage 7-10x what the final bid is done soley to appease 
the warriors?

[I'm just being facetions, please don't take this as a personal 
insult...I'm not demonizing you or your guild. I'm just seeking to 
unravel the intricacies of rp loot systems, and using yours as an 
example; and I appreciate your taking the time to go over it in such 
detail.]

But seriously, consider it this way. You have a supply of warrior items 
and a supply of mage items dropping, and for the sake of argument lets 
say they are at the same rate. But in your guild you have 6 times as 
many warriors showing up at raids as mages so inevitably cometition for 
warrior items will drive the rp costs up for each item, because you have 
a bidding system.

But the mages rarely are in conflict for items... so in an effort to be 
fair you effectively pay them only 1/7- 1/10th an rp per raid to 
'correct' the market for not having enough mages to drive the prices up 
to the same ballpark that warriors have to pay.

That's is pretty much exactly like 'the government' adding a $300.00 tax 
to a bottle of shoepolish because the guy polishing shoes (not some 
bum... the professionals in luxury hotels) earns as much as a 
hairdresser but the hairdresser has to pay 1000.00s for tools and 
supplies each year... and somewhere along the line we decided it wasn't 
be 'fair' if the cost of doing business was different when the gross 
income is the same.

This sort of market tampering in the name of "fairness" is decidely 
unfair, imo. At least if you aren't tampering with the market you can 
attribute the inequity to real market factors... "Hey guys... we've got 
6 times as many warriors as mages in the guild, if you want a warrior 
item... expect to compete."

The real problem here is that your guild composition isn't perfectly 
balanced. That's a fact of life; maybe the guild should use that to 
attract more mages... "Hey, we have a fair rp system, and because we 
have so few mages the prices of mage items are pretty depressed."

So a mage bp drops that I will never wear... and I'm a mage. So I can 
bid on it (and then bazaar it), but the warrior can't? That is a small 
problem, at the very least. And if the guild challenges me (the mage) on 
my bid, because they suspect I'll never wear it.. then we have a de 
facto NBG/loot council operating that wasn't previously disclosed.

Personally I'd open it up, and let anyone bid on anything for droppable 
items. If some warrior has accumulated 100rp and is prepared to blow it 
on a wizard only item let him. The wizards will be pissed but the other 
warriors will be thrilled to lose the competition, as that guy is now 
out of the running for any warrior drops for a while, dropping the rp 
price on warrior items a bit in the long run.

Moreover, what if that guy loves his wizard far more than his warrior, 
but knows the guild needs the warrior on the raid more than a wizard... 
its a disservice to reward his sacrifice to the guild by not letting him 
better the character he prefers.

However, while I *do* recognize that this benefits the player, and not 
'the guild'. I think that is inevitable... at the end of the day any 
'policy or correction' to favour the guild over the player is an NBG 
policy by definition. "The guild needs it more than I do"... and any NBG 
system implicitly presumes that someone is responsible for determining 
"need", and this is invariably both flawed and subject to abuse, and 
ultimately undermines the inherent fairness of a points system.

Until you sell it in the bazaar :)
See above.

I would advocate simply holding autions for banked rp items, and if 
someone someone is looking to unload an item either sell it for pp or 
re-auction it for rp if others in the guild value it enough to bid rp on 
it, at the sellers discretion.

Until we make good friends with someone isn't the most hardcore player...

While the majority of rp systems abuses I've seen are to benefit the 
officers themselves, a large number are to benefit their friends either 
in game or irl.

I have no issue with this.

Ah... that explains a lot.

Its a free market, so prices will settle to meet wealth effortlessly; I 
  wouldn't worry the prices won't spiral unbounded... after all rp 
influx is essentially fixed... and eventually you would expect prices 
for the most desireable items to settle at around 50rp on their own. 
There isn't enough rp influx to sustain prices in the stratosphere for 
any length of time.

So, then, why does inflation need to be artificially controlled??

--PS Thanks again for your responses. I, at least, am gaining some real 
insight into rp systems, and will use that when crafting and evaluating 
future ones.
