Welcome,

  Glad you could join me. Yes - about my sig. Lets turn to page 365 of our
Webster's New World Thesaurus, version year, 1987. You will notice the word
"read." I purposely choose this word for a reason pertaining to your
inability to read the English language as badly as I write it. I guess you
could say, READ 'em and WEEP. Why did I do this? It is an attempt to
enlighten you in hopes that you will read more about ethics and life
philosophy.

    Thesaurus is Latin for "treasure house" Often the written or spoken word
of English can have several meanings and the unversed and under well read
will always miss the side meaning of a word. It's called an education.

   Now, lets take our eyes to the story of the Myth of the Cave as told by
Socrates I believe. If you totally read this and you are well read about it,
you will understand who I am.

   I do not mean to present my self as a greater mind then any of you
because we all have our weaknesses. I just want to be able to chat and or
rant and have people with the common decency to understand when I'm venting
or just beating my fists against the keys. Respect and understanding from
your fellow man goes a long way. That is not something I received when
entering this news group. I call on you all now to stop the decadence
parade.

--
If ya don't want to see IMOs, then block me by all means. Just because you
disagree doesn't mean I'm not right. And like wise. Before you rant at me,
please read Plato, Socrates, Crito, Kant, J. L. Austin, Dewey, Glaucon,
Nietzsche, and other Philosophers. The reads will help you to better
understand what I am saying.  I do hope you all understand what philosophy
is and what it does for your mind.  this is your mind on drucgs__ This is
your mind on Philosophy!
