Prima stuff is usually pretty worthless, with two exceptions:

1. Occasionally they put out something really really good,

2. Occasionally even a crappy guide will have just that nugget of
information you need.

So, it is almost always best to avoid them until you can find one in a local
bookstore and take a good look.  If you are just looking for help on a
specific thing, that look in the bookstore often answers your question, so
you don't even need to buy it.

An example in the first category would be their DAoC Atlas.  That is
fantastic...good maps of all the regions at the time it came out, with one
map of each region giving geographical information and another showing all
major mob camps and what mobs wander in each area, tables giving the level
ranges of the mobs, tables giving the possible loot (and even the
probabilities of the items), tables giving the mobs weaknesses and strengths
against different kinds of weapons and armor, tables giving the mobs'
speeds, and whether they have social aggro, etc.  Excellent suggested
hunting places for various level ranges.  Lists of important quest NPCs in
each region.

However, reading the introduction to this thing, you find that it actually
came about because some players gathered this information and had it on a
web site, and Prima basically bought it and organized it for a book.  This
is why it is so much more useful than most other Prima books I've seen.

A more typical Prima book would consist of stuff gathered from the game
developers *early* in the beta, plus some corrections made during beta.
They are aiming at getting the book out at game launch, and miss the changes
in the later stages of beta, and so generally suck.

So, to summarize, their EQ2 guide most likely sucks at this stage, but if we
are lucky, in a few months they might put out something useful.
