Matt.24
[1] And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples =
came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple.

[2] And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say =
unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that =
shall not be thrown down.

[3] And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him =
privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall =
be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?

[4] And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive =
you.

[5] For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall =
deceive many.

[6] And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not =
troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not =
yet.

[7] For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: =
and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers =
places.

[8] All these are the beginning of sorrows.

[9] Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: =
and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.

[10] And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and =
shall hate one another.

[11] And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.

I don't think I am a false prophet.

[12] And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.

[13] But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.

[14] And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world =
for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.

[15] When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken =
of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let =
him understand:)

[16] Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:

[17] Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing =
out of his house:

[18] Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his =
clothes.

[19] And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck =
in those days!

[20] But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the =
sabbath day:

[21] For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the =
beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.

[22] And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be =
saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.

[23] Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; =
believe it not.

[24] For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall =
shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they =
shall deceive the very elect.

[25] Behold, I have told you before.

[26] Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; =
go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.

[27] For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto =
the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

[28] For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered =
together.

[29] Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be =
darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall =
fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:

[30] And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and =
then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son =
of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.

[31] And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and =
they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end =
of heaven to the other.

[32] Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, =
and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:

[33] So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is =
near, even at the doors.

[34] Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all =
these things be fulfilled.

[35] Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.

[36] But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of =
heaven, but my Father only.

I don't know either, but it is very close.


[37] But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of =
man be.

[38] For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and =
drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe =
entered into the ark,

[39] And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall =
also the coming of the Son of man be.

[40] Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the =
other left.

[41] Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, =
and the other left.

[42] Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.

[43] But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what =
watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have =
suffered his house to be broken up.

[44] Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the =
Son of man cometh.

[45] Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made =
ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?

[46] Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so =
doing.

[47] Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his =
goods.

[48] But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord =
delayeth his coming;

[49] And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink =
with the drunken;

[50] The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not =
for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,

[51] And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the =
hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

Matt.25
[1] Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which =
took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.

[2] And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.

[3] They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:

[4] But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.

[5] While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.

[6] And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; =
go ye out to meet him.

[7] Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.

[8] And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our =
lamps are gone out.

[9] But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for =
us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.

[10] And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were =
ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.

[11] Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to =
us.

[12] But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.

[13] Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein =
the Son of man cometh.

[14] For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far =
country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.

[15] And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another =
one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took =
his journey.

[16] Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the =
same, and made them other five talents.

I think i'm one of the 5 talent people, almost buried all my talents, =
God meant to use them and me now though, so everything that has happened =
to me was meant to happen from the beginning. =20


[17] And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.

[18] But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid =
his lord's money.

[19] After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth =
with them.

[20] And so he that had received five talents came and brought other =
five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: =
behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.

[21] His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: =
thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over =
many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

[22] He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou =
deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents =
beside them.

[23] His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou =
hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many =
things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

[24] Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I =
knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, =
and gathering where thou hast not strawed:

[25] And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, =
there thou hast that is thine.

[26] His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful =
servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I =
have not strawed:

[27] Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and =
then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.

[28] Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath =
ten talents.

[29] For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have =
abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that =
which he hath.

[30] And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there =
shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

[31] When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy =
angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:

[32] And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate =
them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:

[33] And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the =
left.

[34] Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye =
blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the =
foundation of the world:

[35] For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye =
gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:

[36] Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in =
prison, and ye came unto me.

[37] Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee =
an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?

[38] When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and =
clothed thee?

[39] Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?

[40] And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, =
Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, =
ye have done it unto me.

[41] Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, =
ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:

[42] For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye =
gave me no drink:

[43] I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me =
not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.

[44] Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an =
hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and =
did not minister unto thee?

[45] Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch =
as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.

[46] And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the =
righteous into life eternal.
