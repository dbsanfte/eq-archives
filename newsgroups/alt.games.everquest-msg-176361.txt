That is either poorly worded or wrong, you choose.  Taunt either works
or it doesn't.  The chance of success is affected by how far down the
hate list you are, the mob's level, and your Taunt skill.  I can take
a char with a 150 Taunt skill and fail to Taunt a green mob off a char
that has minimum hate (proximity agro, never attacked or cast a spell).
I can take that same char and get lucky and taunt an even con mob off
a char who's been beating and casting on the mob for some time.
Neither of these could occur if Taunt just "adds hate".  When Taunt
works it puts you (barely) on top of the hate list, agro can be taken
from you easily by whoever was previously at the top of the list (i.e.
a single attack that does damage) or by an overwhelming situational
modifier (i.e. low health agro or the strict proximity agro for rooted
mob melee targets).

Another oversimplification that is not correct.  Taunt has an effect
so long as you are not at the top of the hate list.  There are a
number of reasons a mob will target somebody who is not at the top
of the hate list.  So, while it's a bad idea to just keep mashing the
button, it is often wise to hit Taunt after a high agro spell is cast
(Snare, Slow, most DoTs and debuffs, big heals, big nukes, probably
something else I'm not thinking of) as a precaution because it is
possible that the caster has exceeded your hate and you may be holding
agro only by proximity (ever noticed how hard it is sometimes to peel
a mob off a caster?  once the mob's on the caster you don't have the
proximity modifier working in your favor anymore so now you have to
get ahead of the caster on the hate list).  This last is especially
important when tanking for Druids and Shaman, who might well need to
follow-up high agro offensive spells (Slow/DoT/Debuff) with a heal for
your sorry ass.  It's also a good reason to have the Ranger (if you
have one there) cast Snare and also to Snare towards the end of the
battle rather than "getting it out of the way" at the start.

[Oh, and casters should let you know if they're getting resists
especially on high agro spells, because with a resist you get the
downside (hate) without the upside (whatever the spell was supposed
to do to the mob).]
