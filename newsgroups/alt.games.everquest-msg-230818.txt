Never been to CHardok in my life and SolB only to peer in at the zone...

On Antonious Bayle you dont seem to be able to walk into Ned's Landing
anymore from JP.....

The brick tunnel zone line over the river currently drops you off to SFG,
and I cannot find a zone spot over by the Brell gnolls. Darkpaw is too
dangerous for me to wander round in case camo fails but then its rather a
bd place for a zone line to a 35ish zone. THis holds for crossing that
river in JP as well as a sguildmate pointed out to me). Only way I can
currently get there is Magus port....at least that I can find.
