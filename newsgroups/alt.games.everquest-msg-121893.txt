Fear kite animals. I like it better than quadding in crowded or laggy zones.

Rhinos and mammoths in EW. You can do the Snow Griffons with a trick
I learned, use charm to pull them to the zone edge, then you can fear them,
(Have SoC memmed in case of charm break trouble, or just fear them and re try)

Also try the kodiak in GD, easy to fear kite, pull them to the SW corner and fear them.
They might be starting to go green to you though.

Also the Tiger raptors in Wakening lands by the Skyshrine zone. 5 spawn there
and you can pull wanderers when you have cleared the camp. watch track like
a hawk, by the skyshrine zone is pretty safe but one bad mercenary add
can ruin your whole day, they like to hide behind trees. =)

I also liked, doing tigers in EJ but that zone can get a lot of adds quickly.

Fear kiting is fun  and Definitely a thrill a minute, you wont be bored.

For change of pace I use charm to give myself a challenge. Charm
is Awesome when it works but it sucks when it doesn't. Nothing more
fun than an uber buffed charmed Snow Griffon! Woot! Those things
can chew through anything in EW. Best run I had was 5 kills on one charm!
Woot!
