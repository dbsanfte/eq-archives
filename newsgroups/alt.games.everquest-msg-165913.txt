Hiyas! =)

In short: Feerott. All of the eight-legged freaks (both spiderlings AND
spiders) there drop spiderLING silks, and they are EVERYWHERE around the
druid rings. With a tracker (not sure of you class), you will have no
trouble getting several stacks in a hour - I have gotten as much as 6
stacks in 1 hour with my Druid, tracking and killing (and I have to watch
out for the Bouncers, hehe).

Hope that helps, and Happy hunting!
