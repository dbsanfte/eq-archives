A thousand monkeys banging on keyboards posted the following under the
name Graeme Faelban <RichardRapier@netscape.net>:

>You cannot transfer to or from test server.

Tranfer from is restricted for good reason; I had elemental level loot
from VP months before they ever sent it live, for instance.

However the restrictions on transfer to is rediculous and should be
removed. It would be better for the Test server itself.

Note I said TRANSFER, not COPY. /charcopy to Test would be THE SINGLE
WORST THING they could do to both the server and the testing process
for EQ as a whole. Players cannot be allowed to just play throwaway
characters on test. /testbuff and /betabuff showed how poorly that
goes.
