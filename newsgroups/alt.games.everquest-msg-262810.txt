You know its a range fight, but you took the AE?

I would suggest you learn about Fennin/Xeg style strats. No melee or pets
should engage the mob (to prevent pushing it), use a paladin to push it
should the mob get too close (and make sure the tank doesn't move back when
he engages, or he will get summoned OOR).  Basically the tank will be
between the raid and the mob, to maximise the spare range clerics have.

The mob never moves.  You can nuke easily outside the AE range.

If you are not confident the tank will survive all fight, have a second tank
stand alongside the MT.  Put a druid on him to keep him healed up from the
dot.  if MT dies, ST just takes over. Uses fortitude to survive the initial
onslaught, and the cleric chain switches to him.

Smaller range than most EP named AE's...
