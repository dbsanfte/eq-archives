Well, lot's of stuff there is in need of update. The site owner and some
of the chief contributors are apparently trying out DAoC and splitting
their time between the two, and not many updates have been done
recently. But still, the historical material stored there still contains
tons of useful information, and the discussion forum is frequented by a
number of 60 necros, as well as others of low and mid levels. It could
use some attention, but still one of the better resources. I think it's
better than Caster's Realm for necros, providing Casters comes back
online any time soon.
