The best place for a chanter to look for guidance is www.therunes.net 
Everything you could possibly need to know is in the forums :)

With regards what order to get, opinions change with time.  If I was
doing mine over again I'd take a completely different route to that I
did.  Today I think I'd probably do:

General
Regen 3 - especially if your soloing - you will get hit lots!

Metabolism 3 - now that stat food is such a big part of the game I
rate this highly.  Misty picnic baskets at 250pp a stack soon go,
espcially if your on a horse!

I know everyone says Run 3 first but now that we have scale wolf its
less of an issue.

Arch
Spell Casting Mastery 3 - this effectivley gives you a bigger mana
pool, so you can fight longer & sit around less.

either Mental Clarity or Natural Durability.  
MC3 is a prerequisite to Gather Mana.  In its own right its not as
good as SCM but GM is nice to have.
ND3 gives you more hp.

Class
lot depends on your role/guild.  If your in a raiding guild & you raid
lots MGB is for you.  Otherwise I'd go for QB3, although you can get
ldon augs to do this, or Gather mana.  There will always be those
moments when a huge shot of mana is going to keep you alive, just dont
hide the hotkey too well so you can get to it easilly )

I got DC early on - that was pre PoP - and it owned!  I could solo in
most of the top level zones & have a decent pet on raids (although
there were too many dispelling mobs in ToV to make it worthwhile
there).  With PoP it became pretty useless.  Now it gets used in PoE
where the baby dillo's are better than ole shiny bob & I've used it in
PoI to solo near the entrance for gate necklace components.  Otherwise
CoD gives you such a huge advantage so its better to put the points
into Total Domination & Planar Power.

POP
Lots of goodies to spend you aa on here!
Well by the time you get there you'll probably have a better idea of
what you want!

Good Luck whchever way you decide to go!

Hardy
Coercer of Povar
