And let me guess, you would sit there and hold the rights to something like 
Quillmane's cloak hostage for loot, rather than help out someone finish a 
quest, right?

And if I'm go on an anti-druid rant, tough shit.   You spend over 5 hours a 
night, for over 3 weeks in a zone that give no xp, because you need one item, 
and constantly see the looting rights to that one item selling for more plat 
than you'll ever have, and have it be a druid doing so 9 times of 10, and you 
would be more than a little pissed at them too.
