Uphill, both ways.  In the snow, even in summer.

Yeah, we had things harder.  I had to stare at a book during my first 35
levels.  That made the game much less interesting... I couldn't *see* the
fun everyone else was having.

My first two days on EQ were spent trying to figure out how to leave Neriak.
Why should that be something everyone has to face?  I wish I'd had in-game
maps of the newbie zones when I was first playing.

I had to mash my Sense Heading hotkey thousands of times to get my skill up
to 200.  How did that make me a better player?

It took me an hour of real-life time to take a boat from Freeport to Firiona
Vie.  How could anyone consider that fun?

Me, I think complaining about "dumbing down" is, erm, dumb.  If it
encourages new players to stay with the game, all the better - we need fresh
blood in the game, and believe me, it's no fun struggling at 20 when almost
literally everyone else you see is 50+.

I support everything they do to make things easier on the new players so
they will get sucked in and stay with us.  Forever and ever.  =)
