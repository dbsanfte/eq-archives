I just spent a day in Darkfall.

Dungeonrunners was a better executed game than this piece of crap.

The game performs like something from 1994. The GUI is one of the
absolute worst I have ever played.... the combay system is
pathetic.... the crafting is as bad as anything I have ever
experienced! It plays like a bunch of disgrunteled Ultima Online hacks
got together in a basement to comesurate over their loss of unlimited
ganking and decided to make their own game! Unfortunately it appears
they never played any OTHER games since UO!

In short, these guys should be paying players to come engage in this
piece of shit rather than charging the going PREMIUM subscription rate
or $14.00 a month and charging $50 bucks for a game that is clearly 12
years out of date.

Simply pathetic. Like I said, Dungeonrunners was a better game!
