Tried single grouping another of the named (Eindride Icestorm)...was our
first time in the towers.

Group was:

ranger, rogue, enchanter, shaman, cleric, warrior...

Tried him twice didnt kill him....second attempt got him to about 30% or so,
so it can be done for sure (and we aint heavily geared etc).

Enchanter now has TD3 so should be easier when we try again (just means war
/ rog may have to stand on the sidelines and shoot arrows or summat, but of
course they will be helpful actually getting to him :P).

No idea how hard the one we tried is compared to the other tower bosses.
