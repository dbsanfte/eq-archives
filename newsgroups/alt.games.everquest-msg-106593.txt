Ok, here's my problem. I can be playing EQ and my system will lockup. I have
played EQ for 2 years, on two different systems and never had this problem
until recently (began about the time Luclin came out). The System will
freeze and won't soft boot, only thing to do is turn it off and back on. I
get no warning, just LOCK.

This can happen 5 minutes after I start playing, and repeat every couple of
minutes or I can play for hours with no problem, but I usually won't make it
thru the night without a lockup. This ONLY happens when I am playing EQ. I
can play Age of Empires for hours with no problem.

Now, here's the only thing extra I have noticed. When I lockup like this the
Receive Data Light on my Cable modem goes Bonkers, like its receiving lots
and lots of data. I have 3 computers (none of the others have an OS that
supports EQ) sharing the same modem, and they can still function normally
and get data from the internet.

Basic System specs:
AMD 1.4ghz
Win 98se (with all updates and directx passes all diags)
Riva TNT model 64 (with latest drivers updated)
640MB ram
40gb HD with 30gb free

Anyone have similar experiences? Got any suggestions?
