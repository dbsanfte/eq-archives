Monks werent "plenty overpowered" pre-PoP.

Twinks are/were over powered.  Monks were just a popular class to twink...
my monk couldnt solo SHIT.  If you claim my monk was over powered from 1 to
60 I'll tell you you don't know what the fuck your talking about re: EQ.

I got a fungi at lvl ~56, until that point I couldn't solo a mob in
Dreadlands.  With fungi I could kill some low con mobs, with massive
downtime.   Even with the fungi I couldn't solo in Karnors.  With no fungi I
couldn't solo in SolB

I couldn't solo an entry frog in Sebilis at 59 (the very first 2 low ass
frogs at zonein).  A ranger friend, level 59, could solo them.

At 45-52 with a cleric, I couldn't tank BW undead mobs.  Me, a necro and
cleric were exping in Burning Wood..  when the necro went AFK we tried to
carry on exping, single pulls, the cleric just couldn't heal me in time, and
keep up with heals, for us to win.

We tried 3 times before the necro came back from AFK (fear mob, FD, hope it
runs too far away)

I duo'd with a necro in Skyfire in my low 50's, when fear wore off the mob,
I HAD to FD.  I couldn't tank a mob long enough for fear to be recast each
time, instead letting the pet take the beating.

Compare to now.. I made a rogue.. a twink rogue.. he went to Paladual at
level 1, he walked through the entire dungeon pretty much, tanking VERY red
mobs.  40 mins later he was level 26.

He went to DSP, there he tanked rockhoppers, giant horses, whatever conned
red in there pretty much (including one of the mobs from the outpost whos
red to my 55 mage)

But yeah.. monks were over powered... ROFLMAO

Sorry, Jekke, its not meant as a personal attack on you.. but I think your
SO wrong, and I take offence at people repeating the same baseless argument
on why monks needed to be nerfed.

PS possibly the most over powering AA I've seen in PoP is shroud... a rogue
skill.
