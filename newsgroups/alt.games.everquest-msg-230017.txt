But by the time you are level 6 you are pushing 30 which is a 
serviceable early warning system.

I disagree. Warriors without good armour, buffs, and resistances are 
easy pickings the ranged casters. And since we both agree there isn't 
going to be much good equipment floating around... warriors are dead 
meat to the first wizard with enough mana to burn him down and that 
won't be difficult because there isn't any decent +hp armour, buffs, or 
resists)
