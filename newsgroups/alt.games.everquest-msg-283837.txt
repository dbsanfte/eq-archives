For some reason (a sudden burst of masochism comes to mind) I decided to 
play around a bit with tradeskills for my gnome SK on the Combine 
server.  Unfortunately, for this purpose, he's not really ideal, having 
plunked points into str instead of Int.  So I decided to make an alt. 
Looking at the wisdom classes, gnomes have pretty low scores, but the 
Int classes do well enough, starting at 108.   SK, oddly enough, are 
among those, but my experience with tradeskills suggests that I'll want 
to be able to gate to save travel time.  After brief consideration, I go 
  with an enchanter, who starts with the highest Cha of the Int casters; 
I max out Int and dump the remaining 5 points into Cha to help reduce 
costs.  He'll also eventually get spells which allow him to raise 
faction and alter his race, which should help on costs as well.

I dump some cash on the little fellow, which he uses to buy a full suit 
of small cloth and his starting spells.  Wait, no.  Not that vendor. 
Nor that one.  Hmm, there doesn't seem to be an enchanter vendor here. 
I pull up the Find window, sadly all the spell vendors are named 
Clockwork Merchant, so there's no way to differentiate, but standing 
outside all seem to lead away from, rather than into, the mines.  Well, 
I follow one up to the Library... and it won't talk to me.  Nor will any 
of the other enchanter vendors.  Nor, for that matter, the mage or 
wizard ones.

See, in order to be able to maximize the benefits to my Bertox SK of 
having his own pocket smith, I figured I'd make the enchanter Bertox as 
well.  Just in case, although I suspect that won't actually matter as 
the only relevant spells I can think of at the moment are cleric or 
shaman only.

To the best of my knowledge, there are NO evil merchants for wizard, 
magician, or enchanter gnomes!  Guildmasters yes, but merchants?  Not one.

Well I ended up making an alt for my alt, and having him buy spells and 
drop them into the shared bank.

I also ended up getting smithing up to a whopping 29, which means I 
spent about a pp per point so far; yes, much of that went into spells 
and gear for the enchanter, but it doesn't bode well for my plan to 
rapidly crank out some banded, and then shelve the smith for a while 
till I've built up cash and the will to go further.
