Oh, I agree.  I used to play FA back when it was new but I couldn't get into
the idea of paying $10/mo to do it. ;)  I love flight simulation programs.
I loved AW, I have all the MSFS from version 2 on, played F15(?) over modem
against a friend.  Had a blast.

I'm sure there's lots of people in FA that are very nice...that's probably
why the kids have come over here...they've probably all KFed them over
there.
