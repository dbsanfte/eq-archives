Since no one can define greed anyway it is sorta a moot point.  Any
attempted definition will run smack into the person trying to define it
making a judgement on how much 'stuff' other people should have . If you
have a problem with HOW someone earned his money say so but dont pretend
that earning is bad :)

Adam Smith did indeed start his book with greed works ! He then spent the
rest of the book explaining why :) Pick up a copy of the Wealth of Nations
sometime and read it. Das Kapital was such a nice vision but it depends on
others to work hard and selflessly give up there work to others. Which is
both counterintuitive and if forced evil.

      "The moral justification of capitalism does not lie in the altruist
claim that it represents the best way to achieve 'the common good.' It is
true that capitalism does-if that catch-phrase has any meaning-but this is
merely a secondary consequence. The moral justification for capitalism lies
in the fact that it is the only system consonant with man's rational nature,
that it protects man's survival qua man, and that its ruling principle is:
justice."

        - Ayn Rand
