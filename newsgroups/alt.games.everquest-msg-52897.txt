    Having unbuffed naked folks running into combat to loot while AoEs are
going off would be even crazier. These folks would be battered before they
even started swinging weapons.

    Damage dealers are going to be battered HARD by AoE damage without
suitable buffs.

    As it is now, your casters and healers can rush back in if there's an
overpull. But you don't see that happen, because if there's a problem
usually people are wiped out fast and completely. The days of the "close fig
ht" seem to be drawing to a close at the endgame.

    Um, of course you don't. If you die, you fire up whatever combination of
Selo's, Invis and Levitate you can manage at your level and run back at warp
speed with near-zero risk. For almost every other tank in Seb (say), it's
either a slow run through mildly hostile territiory (EJ) or a SoW-powered
run from FV/OT. Both of which are pure wastes of time. And Seb isn't even
the problem - as you've pointed out, clerics are abundant in Seb. It's the
places like Sol A, and Cazic Thule, great places that have the sort of loot
that would draw people IF they weren't to hell and gone from a bind point
usable by all factions. Having to have a cleric to go to a zone where the
cleric are barely able to Revive seems restrictive.

>It's a game limitation that forces you to plan around it.

    Agreed. But it hurts the game if the best way to plan around a death
penalty is to simply not go to the zones which cause the biggest headaches.
It leads to the sort of crazy overcrowding we see in certain low and
mid-level zones today. A group of people who want to make some characters to
adventure together shouldn't have to make a cleric so their day isn't
wrecked if one person dies on that Sol A trip.

    This is an option that wouldn't change if melees could be bound
anywhere. You could keep your bind in Kael, AND if required could change
your bind to somewhere more useful.

>But I guess bards running faster than other classes is broken too.

    No, you folks have earned every class feature you have. If there's a
class that Verant has forgotten, it's the bard.
