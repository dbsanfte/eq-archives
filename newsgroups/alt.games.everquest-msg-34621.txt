It's only the ranged AoE spells like lightning strike etc that limit you
to 4 targets - druids quad kite because its nice to be well away from
the mob while you're nuking it, rather than being beaten on by several
mobs while you do it. In an AoE group, a druid would probably be using
point-blank AoE spells like Earthquake, and they can hit more than 4
mobs.
