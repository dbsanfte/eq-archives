I got yelled at last night (as some of you have expressed as well) for
"disturbing" a "wedding"
1) you shouldn't have a wedding in Oasis.
2) where was I supposed to go with the group of aggro'in deepwater crocs and
mummies?  The middle of the desert?  uhhh, no.  I'm gonna go to the dock,
where everybody sits so I can get some help.
3) wtf were you having a wedding on the dock at Oasis for?!
4) GAH I hate EQ weddings!!
5) oh nevermind already.  I hope a deepwater croc eats your wedding dress.
