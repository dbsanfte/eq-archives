Some people are just idiots..

I guess they expect to play on a Europen server and then want everyone to
speak english..

LOL.

Even 'in game', I see the same idiots.. The peck last night shouted "Oh, to
the DE Noob.. Speak Common pls!" (He wasn't talking to me, but I have still
ran into this before. Some idiot was all bent out of shape because he
started a PvP fight, and lost to me. So he starts sending me tells. I dunno
if he figured out what I said in Dark Speech or not, I didn't really care to
be honest, but he got real mad.. Started USING CAPS to tell me to speak
common.. all he got was.. In Dark Speech, "Look if you can't understand Dark
Speech I guess you are out of luck, it's not my problem." /ignore

some people..


Well, first off it's not MY problem if you cannot speak the language I am
talking in. Secondly, I don't reall care if you can understand me or not. If
it's that big of a deal, learn the language.
