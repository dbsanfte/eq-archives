Yeah, one thing I would definitly have to say is the whole issue wouldn't be
much of an issue in the first place if the rule were truly enforced. I had
no idea a guide could not change it. I don't follow what potential for abuse
that you see though?, not to say there is not potential (I don't know the
role of the guide to any great degree). I would have just assumed abuse on
the guide's part would jeopardize their role as a guide?
