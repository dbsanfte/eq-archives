I believe it's a 15% xp penalty, so figure about 15% longer than a race 
without a penalty.  What race is your shaman?  If barbarian, they have a 
5% penalty, so a troll won't seem quite so bad to you.  If Vah Shir, I 
think they may have a penalty also, not certain.  No clue on Frogloks.  
If an Ogre, they have a 10% penalty I believe, could even be the same as 
for trolls.  It's been posted here before, but I am feeling to lazy to 
search for it right now.
