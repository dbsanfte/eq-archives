I'm mildly bummed those got released.  They're not -really- made for the 
cartography system...they're conversions of maps made from ShowEQ.  Thus, 
they don't really mesh well with the default maps since lots of stuff is 
labeled twice or has overlapping lines marking the same contours (for those 
who haven't checked out the system, EQ displays cartography maps 
superimposed, with the default ones on base and any user-created 
annotations/maps on levels 1, 2, and 3), but they're not detailed enough to 
turn the default maps off either.  Moreover, EQ always seems to go back to 
all layers on when you zone, but that may be a bug.  I finally ended up 
removing them, though I imagine I'll second-guess myself when I hit a zone 
that SOE hasn't mapped for me.

My fear is that since these are out, nobody will bother making any "real" 
maps, which would kind of suck.  Lord knows I'm not going to sit there and 
meticulously map out every zone with the awkward system we're given.
