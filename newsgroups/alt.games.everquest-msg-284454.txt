Much to my amazement, I recieved a private tell by someone who 
apparantly didn't want to embarass me in public here... like thats 
possible... by showing what an idiot I am.

Checking into his statement, the GJB is not used for ranger epic nor any 
epic whatsoever, and is in fact merely a desirable weapon for the era, 
and a rare drop one.  Looking at the stats, IMO its not really even all 
that and a bag of chips!

Nonetheless, if the ranger had said she didn't have better, I'd have 
awarded it to her on NBG basis because she's the only one who could have 
used it... IF she could demonstrate that it was inferior to either her 
current offhand weapon or the sword of mist.

If it was replacing the sword of mist, I'd have to side with the bard, 
she should give it back up to him, as it went to her on a NBG basis but 
she no longer needed it, a tricky question though.

On the gripping hand, I don't think this really affects my story, since 
all six of us in the group at the time thought it WAS for ranger epic, 
including the bard, to me his actions were still wrong, even though they 
were based on faulty information.
