> The issue here is censorship,

You truly have no concept of what censorship is, do you?

I think of you as a young guy, probably a teenager, who right now thinks 
your opinions mean more than anyone else's.  You have some strange idea that 
you have the right to say whatever you want to whomever you want, regardless 
of the circumstances.  You have to understand that nature of reality, which 
is simply this: you're wrong.

Deal with that, and you'll be a much happier person.

This part of the maturity process, and I'm certain in ten or fifteen years 
you'll begin to understand.  In the meantime, your continued illogical 
rantings just make you look foolish and immature.

This isn't David vs. Goliath, this is Chicken Little.  And guess what?  The 
sky isn't actually falling.
