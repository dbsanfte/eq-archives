 There is a green skeleton that aggros 98% of the time. Not too hard to
kill if you're able to use the hammer. However, about 1 in 10 I seem to
aggro the dragoons in the outpost. Not often and not sure why but it
does happen.

 Venril Sathir faction.. You can raise it with braids and with Kunark
dragons which give +VS faction. Nearly impossible to go from KoS to
not-kos on dragons though.

 With the faction changes to illusions DE may be enough to get you
un-KoS enough to turn in braids. 

 Puppet strings from Plane of Fear are also an option.
