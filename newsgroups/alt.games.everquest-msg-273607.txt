Though I am surprised (disappointed) by the reactions. You all feel that a
novice news group user should in fact go download the rules/etiquette etc
before responding to a post. I always thought (and I have been using various
news group's for about ten years, starting way back when BBS's where a fade)
that they were created for open discussion and not an excuse to flame and/or
attack someone that wishes to participate in the community. Sure did get a
lot of response from a "/agree".  Granted it was a long post, and I should
have cut it, but then again if you are reading this then you have time.
Sorry to cost you all a couple of cent's.



Disappointed by the respect and/or lack thereof. It is to easy to disrespect
someone you do not even know, and/or make assumptions about that person.



Top posting is both good and bad, even though perceived as mostly bad. A one
word response is not considered bad in this case as I was not referencing
any one specific part of the original post rather the entire post. It was
also the first response therefore not scrambling other users comments and/or
making the thread hard to follow for new readers. It is true however, that
"not" cutting the original post was a mistake for that I apologize. But top
posting it was not, as if I had remembered to cut the original, the entire
post would have read "/agree".



Can't wait to see the flames. ; )
