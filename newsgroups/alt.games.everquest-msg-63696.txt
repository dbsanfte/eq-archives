Unless you're a massive twink with a main in a 50+ guild, you will not
complete your epic until post-50.

You CAN however get started on it.  At level 33 I've foraged the Everfrost
root, Gfay fruit and Rose of Firiona, and just need to spend an hour in
Innothule for my part there, and start porting myself to Misty when I need
to bank rather than just gating into Thurgadin.  =P

As far as I know, the druid and cleric epics are the only ones with NO
planar requirements, thus are the only ones you could even think of
completing before 46.

As far as you could get at 30 - you could run the note from BW to Gfay, and
get the coin in Kithicor.  You can also forage the Chilled Tundra Root in
Everfrost, the Ripened Heartfruit in Gfay, the Speckled Molded Mushroom in
Innothule and the Sweetened Mudroot in Misty Thicket.  Also, you can forage
the Rose of Firiona in Firiona Vie and do the mini-quest to get the platinum
speckled powder.  Plus you can do the grocery run for the ancient pattern in
Timorous Deep.  Also, be on the lookout for a cheap Jade Reaver for sale in
EC if you can afford it.

If you can get the friends together to kill the corruptor in EK, you can get
the Softly glowing stone.  From here all you have to do to get the Elaborate
Scimitar is kill the VS remains.

Also, you can begin some of the Tainted/Corrupted killings, such as the
Mammoth in Everfrost  (while you forage!) the goblin in LRathe, and in a
couple levels group for HGs in Rathe Mtns and get the giant, this is all you
need for the cleansed spirit of Antonica, if it seems too easy, don't worry
it gets a lot harder...

Unless you have a bunch of level 50+ friends, you  will not get any other
corrupteds for a while, and they're mostly group required, with a few raid
level encounters, dependant on levels of people involved  (Kedge spine, Frog
essence, Faydedar).

And a quick note on Faydedar, once you spawn him and have a tank on him,
make sure you get it through all the idiot robes heads to NOT sit down until
you have a dead dragon, and to be in melee range to land spells.  Every bad
Faydedar raid I've heard of went wrong when a wizard went OOM trying to land
lures from max range and sat down, drew agro, got killed and ping ponged the
fish among all the robes and their craptastic AC and uber aggro powers of
mad sitting.  (or some deviation of the above)
