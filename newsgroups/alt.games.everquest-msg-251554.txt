I just started raising my skill in jewlry making and to that end I
bought a jewelry kit(or whatever the little box is called).  When I
first started using it, it would open up into the full window with
recipes and being able to automatically use items in my backpack.
After a few uses it now only opens to  a small box with a combine
button. Is it possible to get it to open back up to the full window? I
tried buying a new one but that didnt work.
