I do notice that.. nothing quite as funny (or sad) as seeing the same
schmoe repeatedly beg for a SOW or port for an hour or so, when they
could bloody well have WALKED to the zone they want to get to in that
time.  I only have one SOW capable character and a bard, so the
majority of my characters don't get to run around like they have a
rocket attached to their butt, and I seem to get along fine  :)

Not that I ever turn down a SOW when offered, mind you  :)
