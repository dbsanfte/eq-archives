}A tool can be used for many purposes.  However if you give someone a tool

No, but nor do they have a right to complain just because they can't go to 
the trouble to figure out how to pound a nail in with a shoe.

}If you want them to use a tool for a purpose which is rarely,

Sure it would.  But the absence of such suggestions or hints does not give 
you grounds to whine about it.  It's allowable to just say nothing, you know, 
if you can't see what good a wrench is in these circumstances.  But flaming 
people who are trying to help you is almost never a good move.

}> }Second, they didn't look as if they were

}I was basing this on the activity of the thread, regardless of how many

Well, you were wrong.  You should have been basing it on Ben's activity in 
the thread, not the thread as a whole.

}> }Third, I simply asked if they had
}> }read the whole post.  I even began my reply in such a way as to hopefully
}> }NOT get the type of responce I got.  Something more along the lines of
}> }"They might be suggesting using EQW to start EQ, then use something else 
}> }to close it." rather than "well if you werent so busy trying to get all 
}> }pissy".
}> Well, dude, I hate to tell ya, but you sound rather pissy about it.
}> *shrug*
}As I said before, simply answering the question would have been more
}appropriate.

He -did- answer the question.  It was not the answer you would have liked, 
but I doubt he thought it was a test he'd be graded on.  Nor, with you asking 
the question, would he have thought you already had an answer key to compare 
it to.  Rather than saying "Aggh!  You didn't read my question!"  you could 
have said, "Hmm, I don't see how it would work with that, could you explain 
further?"
