Hmm it's very strange. I was playing EQ last night and again tonight for
several hours and no disconnect :-)

Wonder if it's only being applied to accounts created after a certain date?
I signed up last Nov/Dec time.

Just had a thought. What version of AOL's software are you using? I'm still
using 5.0. Are you using 6? Perhaps it's tied into that?

Cheers,

Dave
