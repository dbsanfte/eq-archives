Well, warriors and clerics are even more one dimensional, yet no one
is holding that against them.

I get ticked off cause your attitude is shared by many, and leads to
wizards being forced to solo through much of the game.

Just as I expressed my opinion that the real problem with wizards is
that there are too many players like yourself that are convinced the
only way to play EQ is in your "typical exp grind". We all know that
means fighting one mob at a time, mezzing extras, with damage coming
from melee, while clerics sit on their ass and heal. Exactly the type
of fighting that does not take advantage of what a wizard can
contribute. The best combat weapon a wizard has to offer a group is
AE. AE spells offer the best mana/dmg potential of any spells in the
game, by far, and wizards have the best AE.
