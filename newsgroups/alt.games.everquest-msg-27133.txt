As much as it pains me to knuckle under after forty some levels of
playing my Troll as evilly as I could, I've come to the conclusion that
banking in N. Freeport is just too tempting if you're going to spend any
amount of time auctioning to buy/sell stuff in E. Auctionlands.
  Currently, my faction with the FP Militia is at Dubious, so I can hang
around the front gates if I like. It got that way from a combination of
Goblin Ear quests in Highkeep and *killing Knights of Truth faction
NPC's*!!!  So obviously, my KoT faction is probably about as dismal as
it's possible to get.  I really don't care to trash my FP Militia
faction, because I travel through there a lot and Sgt. Slate can be a
pain in the butt. (Loading....... please wait.)
  I looked over the list of quests to raise KoT faction, and none of
them look too promising.  Plenty of mobs exist for the purpose, though.
With this in mind, it leads to the following questions:
1.  Are any of the quests better/easier/quicker than the others which
could be done by a KoT KOS troll, and dubious to FP Militia to get to
dubious with KoT?
2.  Aside from slaughtering green orcs for days on end (or at least
kicking the ones the newbies are killing) any other hunting that could
win me big faction points?
3. Is there any sort of KoT "test NPC" who's not in N. Freeport but in a
fairly safe and accessible area where I can check my faction to see when
I make it to dubious?
4. Where does the evil people's tunnel outside W. Freeport come out in
N. Freeport? Anyplace near the bank? If not, what's the quickest,
safest, best route for me to the bank with my questionable faction in
those areas?
5. What other factions in N. FP do I need to worry about in trying to
reach the bank assuming I get up to dubious with KoT? Any NPC's of note
to avoid?
6.  I've never had trouble with bankers yet, but will I be able to do
business with the N. Freeport banker, or is there more/separate faction
work to be done there?
TIA.
