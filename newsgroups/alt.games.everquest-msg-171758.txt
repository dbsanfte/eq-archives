That tended to be an average life span.

When 25% born did not live a full year and only about 50% reached
adulthood (age range being 14 to 17 to be considered an adult) the
average life span was indeed short. In general if making age 25 years
the odds were good (baring war, famine or other major event) that one
could live to 50 and some lived many years longer.
