this is a desperate plea for help.  i have been camping stormfeather for
over a year now with my warrior, on and off.  i have sat there at his spawn
point for up to 3 days at a time non stop, and have all my twinks killing
cougars so i can log my war on to get SF if he pops.
i am soo sick of this camp, is there a way to make him spawn? does he have a
PH? HOW CAN I KILL THIS GUY AND MOVE ON?this is my last map piece, please
help with any info you may have.
