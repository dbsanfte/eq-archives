I had fun this evening.

Had someone pop up and say "Can I get a sow?".  I said "Yes.  You can
get SoW with one word.  And the word isn't "plz".".

She thought for a while, then said "Plat".

Another short while, then tried "Donation".

I pointed out that the clock was ticking, and that the Spire would be
firing in another 2 minutes.  Further, that the word was an obvious
one if you want something from someone.

She then said something along the lines of "You said the word isn't
please.".

I responded with "No, I said it wasn't "plz".".

At 30 seconds to go, she said "please".  I immediately cast SoW on
her.

Odd thing is, I think she still didn't get it; her last statement was
a question, asking "What was the word you're looking for?".

With me it's simple; 50 Plat or the word "please", either will get you
SoW.
