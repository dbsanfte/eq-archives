For clerics: put in some freaking undead mobs PLEASE?

I mean its an embarassment, look at our spell list, undead are the one mob
we are really designed to go after, and there's not one freaking undead
mob on the whole epic.  At least getting my cleric gold bracer (which I
still wear at 60) I actually got to use sense undead and undead nuking!

Wouldn't you love to get Selos Drums of the March level performance
out of that epic, instead of storebought hand drums performance?  With
my plan, all you'd have to do would be to own those drums and put them
uppermost in your inventory, the improved epic would use those stats.

Aye and mages would still get the shaft, since they don't get a weapon
as such at all... but its just a thought anyway.
