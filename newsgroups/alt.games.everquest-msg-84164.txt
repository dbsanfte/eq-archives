What is going on with this system lately? I spent over an hour last
night trying to get in, only to consistently get "You already have an
active character, blah blah blah". This has been going on for almost a
week now. Here's how it usually goes down: Let's say that on Day 1 I
camp to desktop and call it a night. I will start up EQ on Day 2, at
least 20 hours since I camped, and select my server. After selecting my
character I do not get into the game. After it looks like it's trying to
put me in the world for about 5 minutes, I'm back to the Server
Selection screen. When I try to get back in, I get the "You already have
an active character, blah blah blah" message, the dreaded 1018. I know
I'm not the only one having this problem because the chat room is full
of people with it, and all the GMs say, when they say anything, is "try
rebooting your system". That's such a stupid answer. But just to prove
that they don't know what they are talking about I did it. I restarted
my system and stay offline (as you will see in my addendum to this post)
for at least 30 minutes. When I tried to get back in, this time I
actually got "YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED" after selecting my character,
and the whole cycle started all over again. This is what I, and others,
have been dealing with day after day recently. And when we do get in, we
get LD after LD. What is going on at Verant? Do they need the 486s that
they use for servers? And this is just when I was getting ready to say
that my performance had been fairly good recently. Quick log in times,
quick zone times, acceptable lag. In fact, with texture caching on some
of my zone times are almost instantaneous. Even last night after I got
in the performance was good, with little lag and only one LD. I even got
to within 1 yellow bubble of level 11 while grouping with a guildmate in
a zone I had never been to. In fact it was very refreshing last night to
try something new, without any maps of the zone or anything. A friendly
wizard ported me for free from Greater Faydark to North Ro, after
hitting me with Levitate and Invisibility first. I arrived in North Ro
with no idea of where I was, bouncing up and down above the platform.
All I know is that there were a lot of biiiiig spiders out there! While
waiting for my guildmate to come and fetch me I decided to get some xp
off of one of them. Of course I lost my invis as soon as I shot an arrow
into one. Funny how those spiders group together. Next thing I know I'm
fighting about 5 of them, only succeeding in killing 1 before I turn
tail and run. Luckily my friends caught up to me before I ran halfway
across the continent. Anyway, it was fun and has absolutely nothing to
do with the subject at hand. I just hope that Verant gets the other
problems worked out soon, and I'm just glad that I had a fairly good
night once I got in, because it had been quite a traumatic evening up
until then. Let me explain....

It was a dark and rainy night. While sitting in my favorite chair,
enjoying a nice cup of tea and J.R.R. Tolkien's Silmarillion, I heard a
noise, as of movement, coming from my kitchen. I paused in my reading to
better focus my senses on the noise. Indeed, it continued. Stealthily I
arose from my chair and silently moved through the darkened house to the
kitchen entryway. There I halted, to attune my eyes to the dark and my
ears to the acoustics of the room. There it was again; the noise
continued, and it was coming from not more than two feet in front of me!
I quickly flicked on the kitchen light. The noise continued! Whatever
was making it was bold! Then I saw it. There was a little tiny mouse
trying to get into a trash bag that I had set down to take to the curb
the following morning. What to do, what to do. I looked around. Near the
front door to the house I saw a child's plastic baseball bat. "Ah ha,
that's just what I need to protect myself," I concluded, proud of my
tactical skill. I slid to the front door and grabbed the bat, and
quickly moved back to my original position, steeling myself for the task
that lay ahead. Apparently in my burst of biological instinct for
survival I forgot that I don't kill. Anything. Not even a fly or a
spider. No time to think about that now! This is bat country! I lunged
but my prey was quicker, and made a move to escape. Ha! There is no
escaping the great white hunter! I chased the vermin around the kitchen,
cutting off every attempt of his to escape, attempting to land blow
after blow and missing each time. Finally I squarely landed a hit on my
opponent, but it wasn't lethal. In fact, I believe I only stunned the
foe, as it stopped moving and just stood there looking at me. As the
realization of what I had just done and the guilt set in, I knew what
had to be done next. I was much bigger than this creature and the knock
to the head I gave it could have severely injured it. It would not
survive if I left it alone. The die was cast and I had crossed my
Rubicon. I smashed the immobile beastie again and this time it was a
critical hit. The soft, furry creature lay on its side with one of its
rear legs twitching. Now depression was being added to my guilt. Surely
it couldn't still be alive? But one of its legs was twitching. So I
whacked it again. And again. And again. At this point a spray of blood
appeared on the floor and the once-living being was no longer moving. I
was victorious; my noble foe had been defeated. But at what cost? I was
devastated. I mourned my worthy adversary, a noble four inch, furry
child of nature. I shall never be the same again.

I don't want this anger that's burning in me.
It's something from which it's so hard to be free.
But none of the tears that we cry in sorrow or rage
Can make any difference, or turn back the page.
