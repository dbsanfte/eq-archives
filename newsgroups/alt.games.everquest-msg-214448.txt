}Ya. Bout time they fixed that BS animation they screwed us over with a
}couple expansions ago.

Well, I'm glad you all like em.  I think they're positively hideous.  For 
looks, I'd choose the luclin skellies.  Although, the luclin skelly combat 
animations were always a bit iffy.  Oh, goody, my skelly pet is going to 
go over and stare at the mob until it falls over, hehe.  At least these 
skellies do seem to be easier to target than either of the previous 
models.  Horde of skellies chasing the tank back to us, oh dear, here we 
go... Hey!  F8 worked for once!  Yaaay.

Conversely, at least in MM, anything that -wasn't- a skelly was downright 
impossible to target.  I clicked on the middle of the dang mob's back 3 
times, why isn't it targeted yet?  Arrgh.  And all the other mobs in MM 
looked -really- cool, I thought.  Well, the little whirlwind guys were 
kind of lame, but other than that. :)
