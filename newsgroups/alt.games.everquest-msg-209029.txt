0) My response to your other response to me is included here

1) Except when I've responded directly to the point, you are the ONLY
person in the subthread to use the word "range".  don't believe me?
how about you quote a post and a date and time.

2) Your first comment in the sub-thread you took issue with James for
saying exactly the same thing with different words:

/quote James
Every item has a built-in min and max price. Just set the min to equal
the max. You can see proof of this, BTW, when selling different items
and comparing the ratios of buyback price to sale price.
/quote

All that's required here is to realize that James is referring to a
"min" vendor sell price and a "max" vendor buy price.  I've already
pointed out in another post that I cannot see any other reasonable
way to read James' post.

You replied to that with:

/quote Darktyger
I was under the impression that every item had a "base value" and that
faction and charisma added or subtracted a certain % based on the
scores in each...
/quote

Which appears to combine a misunderstanding of what James posted
with a belief that there is a _single_ "base value" for all items.
You later either changed or clarified (it is not clear which) your
position to be essentially identical to James' (i.e. separate buy
and sell prices).  Despite having subsequently taken a position
essentially identical to James you continue to argue (about what
I'm not at all clear on) and to make remarks about "RANGE" (again,
your caps!) which nobody else refers to (again except for me in
direct response to you).

I note that, in your other response, you quote the same post by
James as alleged proof evidence that "RANGE" isn't your invention.
/boggle

Regardless, your posts here have gone around in circles, saying
nothing aside from some minor inaccuracies that you later (mostly)
abandon, and you end up saying exactly the same thing as the poster
you took issue with in the first place and babbling about that
somehow making you "not wrong".  It's downright inane.

If nothing else, this has reminded me why I stopped reading and
responding to your posts for awhile, it appears to have been a
mistake to start again.
