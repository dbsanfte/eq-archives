You can all blame me for this patch and for its going
over time, by the way.

This time of year I don't have a lot of EQ time available,
and when I do its in short stretches.

Today, though, I ended up babysitting for some friends
along with watching my own kids, figured I'd be able
to spend the day doing some real exp work at last,
get at least half the remaining 59 out of my way...

These plans were set up a week ago.

So last  night (too late to change to another day) I
find out about today's patch.

And now they extend it to add torture.

The chance of a patch is directly proportional
to the amount of time you have free on patch day,
and inversely proportional to the time you
ordinarily have free!
