I agree.  When a chanter wants to join the group I don't normally ask "now you
DO have clarity don't you?  And haste?  You can *haste* can't you?  Did you buy
MEZ, by the way?"
(OTOH, I once had to ask a warrior "excuse me but you DO have some weapon other
than that fishing pole don't you?"  We all got a good laugh out of that one :)
