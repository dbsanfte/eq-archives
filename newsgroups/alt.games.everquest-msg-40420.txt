Tis my opinion that EQ has witnessed a gradual and signifigant flow of
subscribers away from Norrath to Anarchy Online (my entire guild of
30+ strong plays AO much more than EQ). Furthermore, tis my suspicion
that when Dark Ages of Camelot appears on the retail shelves, and
irons out its inherent launch bugs, another outflowing tide of EQ
subscribers will commence. The forthcoming Luclin release is expected
to entice many EQ'ers to return to the Norrathian fracas, or so
Verant/Sony hope with fingers crossed.

If and when NWN becomes a reality, it will seem as if the lands of
Norrath become overthrown with a epidemic of proportions, as the lands
return to their pristine and quiet conditions guarded by the evil
denizens who once where the vast majority of inhabitants....

<actually, the overwhelming aging factor, at least on the older
servers, has created an unbalanced economy and topsided gameplay issue
(I personally know of a person with 5 60 charachters and 3 50+ chars
on their one account!). Verant has provided no avenues for these chars
to continue to grow, and no "retirement" benifits whatsoever. An
increase to 65 with the Luclin release would have been nice, but as it
wont be, where does one expect to take his or her 60 chars to???>

<and what about the rumours: 1) the subscription increase to 12.95$US
as of Jan 1, 2002  2) the server scaleback upon the release of the
Star MMORPG 3) what effect, if any, will the several lawsuits agaisnt
Sony/Verant have upon EQ ???>
