At earlier levels a lot of people don't loot much since they have higher
level alts to feed them and such.

Everyone else has pretty much explained how to deal with it so I'll just add
my 2cp

Ever since I've been hunting in OT, most people aren't concerned much with
loot, half the time I just end up looting everything (as a druid) to get the
damn corpses off the screen  (especially the tank-rhinos).

From earlier on, I was in a group in FM at the giant fort and made an
offhanded remark that the bard was looting rather fast, so what does he do?
thinks he's being funny and loots EVERYTHING before it even finishes dying.
After a quick conversation over /tells with the rest of the group me and the
shaman (only healers) convince the other people to disband and reform
without him, since the bard was group leader.   He asks to rejoin and says
he won't loot any more, I didn't see him kneel down over a giant the rest of
the night.

Lately I've been spending a lot of time in Lguk, and mostly no one seems to
care about looting much (except for rolling on the obviously valuable drops
such as FBSS or likewise)

My best advice would be that if you feel you aren't getting your fair share,
speak up, from playing my warrior, I tried to make sure everybody got their
share, but sometimes a caster just isn't getting up, and so a lot of times
I'd ask if they wanted a gem or something low weight/high value (same for
monks).

Also, I do try to use the /split command to share the wealth if I go
cleaning up a bunch of corpses and get a healthy amount of cash.

Then again, I don't get why in higher end groups clerics tend to say "can I
have that?" to EVERY gem that drops, they aren't chewing through peris THAT
fast.
