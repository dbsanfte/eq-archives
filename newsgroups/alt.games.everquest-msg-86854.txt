Well, I had my first new Ragefire experience yesterday, and even though my 
guild has another clicky-cleric, it left a bad taste in my mouth.  I, 
along with a LOT of other similarly leveled folks, have been stopping in 
to check on the progress of Ragefire in Skyfire, chatting with the clerics 
camping there, singing my AE manasong if there are groups fighting to kill 
time, and even joining the groups to keep them company.  I have several 
friends in other guilds who are waiting for it, and they all say that 
having people stop by and join them for an hour or two really cuts down 
the boredom.
One cleric had been camping it for almost 5 days, and in the probably 
10-12 times I've popped in since Wednesday, he's been there, with a couple 
friends, holding the spot.  Yesterday we had just finished dropping Trak, 
yet again, so we had a serious raid force already assembled.  We were 
distributing Trak teeth when the word came out that Ragefire was up, and 
that it might be a good idea to head to Skyfire.  Because we were already 
mostly grouped, and had porters in each group, it took almost no time to 
aseemble an overpowering force in Skyfire.
When we got to Skyfire, the cleric who had been camping Ragefire engaged, 
and failed in his attempt.  We held a rather impassioned discussion in 
/guildchat, and the consensus was that we wouldn't interfere, but that if 
anyone else started massing, and Ragefire was unengaged, we would kill 
him.  About 25 minutes after we entered the zone, two or three other 
guilds all started zoning in at once.  There had been 18 in the zone when 
we got the word, we brought 40 with us (like I said, overpowering force) 
and there were 60 in zone for the 20-25 minutes that we waited.  
The cleric who had failed was asking us not to interfere, which we 
respected.  As soon as others started zoning in though he then asked us to 
help him kill it.  At this point we figured that it was FFA, others were 
massing, so I engaged Ragefire and pulled him to the waiting ambush.
We killed him quickly, and have a very happy and very deserving cleric, 
but everyone involve feels bad.  We've discussed it with the cleric, and 
he understands that we gave him his chance, and did everything we could to 
not interfere until it was obvious that others were actively prepping for 
an attempt.  His posts to our server forums made it clear that we didn't 
run over him or interfere, and his friends have followed up those posts 
confirming that we did nothing wrong, yet I still feel just dirty after 
the whole incident.
I would dearly love to see Ragefire moved back somewhere out of the way 
where you really can ensure your spot by camping with a force able to keep 
the FGs cleared, and still have a bit of time to mass your forces.  I've 
sat through the 100 hour SolB camps, and since there is no way to just 
port a raid force in, the camper is much less likely to be overrun.  
Everyone bitched about how much the old Ragefire sucked, but for the 
smaller guilds, at least you had a shot, because everyone knew it had to 
be camped, and if you camped it and didn't get dumb, you were pretty 
likely to be successful.  
I'm sure some here will think I and my guild are assholes, and that we 
should have killed Ragefire for the other cleric, and that's your right.  
Maybe that would have been the best answer overall, but I don't see anyone 
suggesting that guilds kill Sev for whomever has kept a twink camped in EJ 
for 72 hours.  Anyone have any words of wisdom?
