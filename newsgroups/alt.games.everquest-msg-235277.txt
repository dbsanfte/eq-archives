HI all.  Next week I will be picking up my new computer and will be
playing EQ.  Ive played UO for about 4 years and thought Id give EQ a
try but till now my computer wasnt up to it.

Im on the south west coast of Canada and dont as yet know which server
will be the best for me but I have cable so hopefully wont have much
lag.  Im interested in playing a Dwarven Cleric and normally play
online 10+ hours a week.  Im looking for a group of people who are
interested in having fun and exploring the land instead of just
camping at one spot all day long.  Role playing isnt a must but I
enjoy it if you do. :)

Dont bother emailing me as I dont put real email addresses on here
because of all the spam.  Just answer back if your interested in a new
member to your group/guild.
