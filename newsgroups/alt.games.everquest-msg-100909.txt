I think perhaps programmers might be more inclined to bitch about
stuff like this than others, because they realize how easily it might
have been made otherwise.  I'd be willing to bet hard cash that the
ability to make a new chat channel the default mode would require
minimal coding.

I always change my default mode to whatever channel I'm currently
using most frequently, so I can just do the now-intuitive
[ENTER]message[ENTER] routine without thinking about it.  In a raid
situation when the shit is hitting the fan, I sure as hell don't want
to be thinking "ok, semicolon, space, now I can talk."

As a frontend programmer myself, I firmly believe I should always go
the extra mile to ensure that the interface is as easy and intuitive
as possible for the end-user.

I do think though that VI now has some fairly decent UI people and we
might see this implemented before too long.  Probably just an
oversight or mixup.
