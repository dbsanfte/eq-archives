Oasis is not that bad...It can be crowded at times, that's true, but it's
still one of the best places to get XP between 14 and 17, imho. I have
rarely found any problems soloing, finding a group (except with my rogue but
it's a classic), or duo-eing while hunting crocs.
As for Spectres, they're not *that* difficult to avoid if you keep your eyes
peeled.

For looting cash, it's true, it's not the best zone, though. But you get
lots of free water ;)
