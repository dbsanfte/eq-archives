Actually, I like it the way it is. I think this is one thing for the 
players to work out, rather than for Sony to offer a magical code 
solution. Of course, /autosplit ought to work better than it does (it's 
heavily biased towards the looter now), but I don't think it should be 
able to do things like magically generate change.
