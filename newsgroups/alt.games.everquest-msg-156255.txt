This one was so simple I had to log into EQ just to make sure I  was right.
Log on your druid, hit your 'i' key to pull up your personal menu, look at
the upper left. Top has your name, next is your class (druid) and level,
below that will either be the name of a god or it's blank meaning you chose
to be agnostic. Like Solusek Ro for wizards, I believe Karana would be the
first choice for druids. Don't quote me on the latter :p
