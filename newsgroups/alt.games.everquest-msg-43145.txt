Luckily I found out about npc "cleanup" routines on cheap junk, like scaled wolf
pup skins and CB belts (of which I found almost 30 on merchants in Ak'Anon and
bought for a few gold each, what a find). Now I only do drop-transfers in very
secluded places away from npcs and common mob pathings, when I do them at all.
