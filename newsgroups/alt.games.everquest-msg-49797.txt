Below level 35 there was always a choice. There was also a time when the
servers weren't so crowded that there were 120+ people in SolB and LGuk at
all times. Those are the times I was talking about and the choice was
clearly laid out.

CHeal is never resisted and can be used every single fight :) Turgur's
certainly trivialises boss-mob level fights if allowed to stick though.

You're always gonna be lucky to get away without at least a partial CR if
either of these classes dies mainly because Enchanters tend to die very
early in fights. Anyway. . .

Then make sure, if resist issues are present, that you dont pull too many.
And have a secondary healer in the group in case the cleric needs to barrier
:)

Against a lot of mobs, probably. Against hard-hitters, no way. But then I'm
a warrior and will have no truck with discussing the 'defensive abilities'
of Hybrids.
Defensive disc reduces the damage of every hit I take by 40%. That's a lot
of damage mitigation. Plus at 60 it lasts 3 mins and recycles every 11 mins.
Oh, and the recycle counter starts from the BEGINNING fo Disc usage so thats
basically 3 mins on, 8 mins off.

8/

The difference between Aego and Hero+BoF+Marzin is negligible assuming you
can spare buff slots. No need for an 'Aego Cleric' and they are actually a
very bad idea in heavy dispel areas.

Fix those resists. . .

If you wanna see stuff play a Monk otherwise you get to stand where you're
told like everyone else :) My warrior isn't much better off than you - I get
a look at the mob as it's pulled then I get to see belly/feet/arse for the
rest of the fight and that's it :)

Veeshan's Peak can be cleared in a single evening. I'm talking about
spending 1-2 days raiding somewhere to give someone a hanful more
HP/resists/AC. . .sooner or later the effort outstrips the benefit (/wave
Mage Epics).

So can I but the question is how many :)

Had to leave the King camp after 5 hours once because all 6 of us had a
tunic and we couldnt bear the thought of one rotting if he popped again =D
