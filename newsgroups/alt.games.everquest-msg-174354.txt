While its safest to do so, its not safer to pick a random person off the street
to do this than it is to use the drop method.

But I don't care about safe really, lives don't hang in the balance after all; I
transfer stuff from one character to another at least once a day (dropping items
to my selling mule) and finding someone to help do this boring chore gets old
fast.  I have a drop method thats worked literally hundreds of times and has
failed only once; I'm not dropping anything so important that a risk on this
level is too much for me to take.

When I create new characters, I often drop them a small amount of cash so they
can buy spells, a peridot or two is more than adequate to create a "barely
twinked" starter character.  Lose a peridot on transfer... heck, I use 20
peridot a day buffing group/raid members, whats one or two more?
