It's a pointless question and conversation. All the classes except Druid
are nerfed.

;-p
I hear the SK class *used to be* kind of nerfed, but most of them seem
pretty happy with the class balance for them now, and I know they solo
fairly well for a hybrid and have quite a few equipment options. That
said, yeah. Wizards suck pretty bad. Likely the worst of the bunch. I
played mine to 25, nearly smashed my computer in frustration, threw him
in The Hole and started over with a warrior. Never looked back. I'll
play my wizard again some day, but only after my Tank can twink him to
mind-bending, game altering proportions. Of course, aside from getting
+200 worth of Int gear, I'm not even sure how one goes about twinking a
wizard. Any suggestions? I could start collecting stuff in higher level
zones as I go along if I knew what to look for.
