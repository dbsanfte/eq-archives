" Can someone tell me what a good
> modem that I can go out and buy is?

*warning, the following contains very simplified concepts they may hurt the
brain of an engineer or technician*

I can give you a hint - never ever EVER get an internal or USB modem. Stick
to those old fashioned <serial> modems. It is the low bandwidth of the
serial connection that "keeps it honest". A serial modem just cannot shunt
taks off to the CPU as the limited bandwidth of the serial connection is
required almost in full just to take the data itself from the modem.

Ie - most people can connect at around 50k but if a easily compressed file
is being downloaded at the full rate and the modem is uncompressing it then
the actually date being sent down the serial cable can very easily exceed
50k. The "roof" for the serial port bandwidth wise is 115.2k so a serial
modem manafacturer cannot just decide so say, save a few dollars, remove
this IC, maybe ditch that circuit and drop this fucntion since the CPU can
do the same job via software drivers as there simply isn't bandwidth to get
that new "workload" through to the CPU.

Once you stick your modem on a riser slot, PCI slot or a USB then your modem
now has a *much* higher bandwidth access to the CPU so now it is possible to
cut out circuitry and just throw the work those circuits would have done at
the CPU via drivers. Now we all know companies would never cut cost at the
expense of quality don't we....*coughs politely*

Why can't we have the CPU doing these tasks? Well - because the CPU is
already tearing it's virtual sphincter out trying to pass the workload it
already has keeping EQ running semi smoothly. The work a software modem may
be trying to throw at the CPU may just get assigned a lower priority as
well...... ie, who needs error correction on a modem when there is a high
elf's cleavage to vector.... no correction for you!  Ummn - why is my line
going flakely?

So - bottom line. External modems, and not just any external modem but a
<serial> external modem. Keep the bastids honest : )
