It's not so much the eye-candy that bothers me (hell, I'm *all* for form
above function, although in this case it's clearly Microsoft trying to
do MacOSX, and failing miserably :), but the fact that they tried to
make the OS easy to use not through it being clear, transparent and well
laid out, like the original MacOS, but through having lots of stupid,
cluttering "helpul" functions.

I'm using the "melted plastic" look over the classic one just because
it's different, not because it's good. Still, the standard Microsoft
grey, boxy look is one of the seven deadly sins of computing. :)
