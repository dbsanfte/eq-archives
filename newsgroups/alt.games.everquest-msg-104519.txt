Hello all,

I am but a lowly lvl 7 Mage thus far and have most of my prac points still.
I bought a couple of EQ books, and did mucho research on the net about
possilble trades to take up.  I cant seem to find any good hard material on
the subject however.

My question is this:  As a magician what would be beneficial?  Should I
dedicate all my practices to "Researching" to research new spells? Or should
I prac another trade that would be good for a mage?  Or should I do both?
Also, what is a good trade for a Mage to do?

Thanks much in advance.. Happy gaming!
