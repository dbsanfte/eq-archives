I play on a 56k modem and no its fine to use........The nature fo the game
is not 'twitch twitch' a la Quake/Counterstrike where sometimes I have
problems against low pingers. I never really have limits on gameplay I can
fight and react fast enough to deal with most things...even last night
with my ISP playing up giving me an average ping of 700-800 I had no real
issues.

The only thing I will say is that zoning is slow and so you sit for a
while.
