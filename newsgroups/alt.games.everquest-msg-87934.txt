    BOOM - /report Jerkoffbard. Thank you for the evidence. Be sure to
mention that you've /reported what he just said, even if you haven't. Most
jerks know the rules VERY well by that level, and he'll know he's in
trouble.

    Very nice, BTW. :-)

    If you have someone with you that can Annul Magic, do it - drops his
charm. He can always re-charm, but not only will he have to deal with aggro
every time charm drops, he loses mana every time he charms - and bard mana
comes back very slowly. If you can't chain-Annul, then get a friendly buffer
to damage shield the mob while it's charmed (key point, while charmed). A
damage shield will ream him and his rogue friend over unless they have a
cleric with MoK, or are organized enough to know to Pillage before slowing.
Most other buffs would likely be ignorable by his group.

    This is PRIME /report fodder. Seriously. A GM sees this, and he'll come
to help you ASAP.

    This is also harassment - mention that word in your petition, it's a GM
hotbutton and will get you a faster response.

    A report of your damage, with a /con on the spider of Indifferent after
hitting it (and with the bard's "Whutcha gonna do!" on screen) would likely
convince most GMs. It's totally circumstantial, but GMs aren't courts of law
and they just want an excuse to boot jerks.

    If you want the "frontier justice" method... get a friend to call the
train when you pull it, so Tents has time to move to one side (/ooc OMFG,
that looks like a BIG CASTLE TRAIN!!!). Pull from ramps, of course, with a
long-range throwing item like a javelin. Use an item that grants
invisibility at this point, and go to the rear of Mr. Bard's party. Be sure
to come from a direction they aren't facing, and be sure to not drop far
enough to get an "injured by falling" message. When the train gets close
enough to aggro them, feign and hope you get no "has fallen" messages. They
won't know WHAT hit them or why. Do NOT do this after a petition, as a GM
may be watching. Since the bard is buffing the party with his songs, he will
likely catch aggro fast and die.

    You are a monk. You can bring the wrath of the entire zone down on him.
Nobody messes with the monk. As a personal challenge, see if you can somehow
get Velk himself to show up! (Used to be easy with the Eye, not so easy
now.)
