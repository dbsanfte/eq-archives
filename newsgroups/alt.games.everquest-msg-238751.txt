I've only had this happen a couple of times with my cleric.
I pick the biggest tank and send him a tell: /tell PussyWarrior I can /assist
you and pacify on your target so you can pull without adds.  Have you ever done
this before?
9 times out of 10 the answer is no, but they are willing to try.  If they are
unwilling to try I go to the next tank.  
If no tank is willing, I would say this:  Hey, no tanks want to pull.  Would
you like me to bring on my ranger?  She likes to pull.  Of course one of you
tanks will have to leave the group, and you'll have to find another cleric.  
If this didn't jolt them into reality I would leave the group too.  
When I am GL I always make sure one of the tanks is prepared to be puller. 
BEFORE we get started: /tell Bigburlypaladin we could use a good puller for Tak
have cl/ench/wiz/necro so far want to join us??  I make sure they realize this
is gonna be THEIR JOB.
You had an idiot for a group leader and a bunch of bojos for teammates.
