My shaman friend recently did the first couple parts of the epic quest, 
then logged out with her tiny stone in a no rent bag.

No big deal, right?  Just go back and do the first couple parts over?

BUT this will result in positive faction hits.  Nobody in their right 
mind would blink at seeing positive faction hits.  So she could easily 
fix her mistake, go on to do weeks of work to get the rest of the quest 
done, only to get to the final hand in and have the guy eat the tear 
because he likes her too much?

Does any single NPC in the series warn against this?  No.  Does any 
other quest in all Norrath, moon, or planes act this way?  No.

While it might be an exploit to read the walk thru's that warn that we 
-should- do steps multiple times in order to ensure sufficient faction, 
wouldnt' it be just as much an exploit to read any out of game warning 
NOT to do any step multiple times?

IF the warning isn't there in game, and this represents both a change in 
how the quest works (so you can't even ask other shaman who've finished 
the quest... a legitimate in game resource for information) and is 
utterly alien to how every other quest out there works... well it seems 
beyond the pale to me.

they decide to screw up the mage epic quest
