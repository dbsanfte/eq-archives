> Ok, and you are 60th... were you always able to tank?

Well mobs within a reasonable level of me, with 1 exception.

With my monk at low 50's, and a friend playing his low 50's cleric, the
tatterbacks etc in BW totally ripped me apart.

I put this totally down to gear though, my monk was wearing a CSS, and
something lame like fighting batons, exe hood... with my SK, I went at 50,
and me playing my cleric (56 at the time) and SK, I could solo all of the
undead.. SK's gear is much better then my monks was at the time (he had a
fungi + other stuff)

If the healer is a druid, then I'd go with a monk over a warrior.   Sure
monks have less HP, but we take less damage, have the ability to mend etc,
which is easier for a druid to heal.

I would go for a shaman over the druid though,  the bard can snare and DS,
and with shaman slow, melee damage won't even be an issue
