    Invis is "getting to the bodies". Once invis drops - and unless you have
Improved Invis, you don't know WHEN Invis will drop and cannot plan ahead to
stay Invis all CR - you have to be able to deal with aggro. Even with
Improved Invis, you have a timer on how long it takes you to CR - any
longer, and you have to have a plan in place to renew Invis.

    A rogue has Hide/Sneak. That works on MANY more mobs than Invis (and
more than Invis and ITU combined, if they could be combined), has the
benefit of working from the rear arc against mobs that can see through Invis
and Hide, and never drops. Comparing the two is like comparing the crowd
control of a druid and an enchanter. I've seen rogues pull bodies out of
almost every part of upper Sebilis (the Ilis Wiz PH for Grup gives them
problems) - go fetch *that* body, INT caster.
