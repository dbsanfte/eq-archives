It's just a micro-experience bar. It shows you how far you are through the
current yellow bubble of xp.  If you pay attention to it, you'll notice that
it climbs and climbs as the current yellow bubble fills, then it drops back to
zero when the yellow is totally full.  It will make five cycles like that per
level.
