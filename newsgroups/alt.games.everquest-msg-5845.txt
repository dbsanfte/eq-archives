I have just started playing, and had a character who had just reached level
2 when I lost connection due to timeout. When I tried to log on to a server
again, I was told I already had an active character on that server, and was
asked if I was sure I wanted to continue. I had no idea this would delete my
character, so I clicked yes. No big deal since the character was only lvl 2
but I wonder what I'm supposed to do if this happens again. Any tips ?
