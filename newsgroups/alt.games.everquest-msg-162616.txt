That's why it's alphabetical all the way for me.  When I want to look
something up I don't have to remember which continent it's on (I know this
should be easy, but sometimes I just zone out and forget) A to Z works for
me.  Any zones with East, West etc... get filed by the name ie, Karana and
then each zone alpha (East, North, South, West) Zone Connection Maps are in
the front, and LOC tables in the back.
