Where have you heard "raid-based"?

Sure it is high level but I, for one, hope to have many a single group
adventure in many of these planes.  Sure a couple of them will be raid
only, but I hope we can have some fun without sixty of our bestest
level 60 friends wiht us...

As a casual level 60 non-uber guilded cleric, I have hopes that there
is still plenty of content for those of us who aren't farming Ssra /
VT / NToV.
