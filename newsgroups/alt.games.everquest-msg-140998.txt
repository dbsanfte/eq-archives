Daer Ya'll !
I bought a Linksys Etherfast Cable/DSL Router with a 4 port switch model #
BEFSR41 ver.2. and created a home network using Charter Pipeline with a
cable modem.I have a total of 3 PC's hooked up to the Linksys router.

My son plays the online game Everquest and when he is hooked up to the
Linksys he keeps going link dead.We have tried by passing the router and
when he is connected directly to the cable modem there seems to be no
problem with going link dead.

I took the PC's and the router to a techie at a local computer shop and he
charged me 90 bucks and told me that I would have to buy a different brand
router or wait until Everquest comes up with a fix for this Linksys router
model.

I have heard that there should be is a way to solve this problem without
having to resort to buying a different barnd router.


Can anyone help us with this problem ?
Any help or suggestions will be very greatly appreciated !

Thanks for your attention !
