Do you really want to group with snobs anyways? They'd probably spend 
all their time discussing their portfolio's anyways... and given your 
example can't afford new shoes I doubt you'd enjoy their company. :)

When I reach to the point where I feel I *have* to pay money to dress a 
character in a video games in 'trendy expensive clothes' so that he can 
have friends, then its high time to play something else. Fortunately I 
do not feel that need.

Hard to say. There is a sense of entitlement, that you must have all 
your spells for level X the day you ding level X. But that sense of 
entitlement simply isn't justifiable.

You are eligible for Pot9 at 63, but you aren't entitled to it. You 
shouldn't feel compelled to farm plat to get it, nor should you feel 
compelled to buy plat with $ to get it.

If you are having fun playing at 62 without it, there is no reason you 
can't have fun at 63 without it. And sooner or later the parchment will 
drop for you, either that or a few dozen k worth of 'other stuff' will 
drop for you and you can pick it up in the bazaar.

At 46 a cleric becomes eligible for his epic. Should you park your 
cleric at 45 because you know you won't realistically finish it before 
you are 65+??
