Febuary 5th 2003

     I Saved my money and bought the lesser summon corpse spell for my
dark elf necromancer.  all I need is to buy a ceramonial burial
coffin. my question is can this coffin be used more then once? and
also where can I find it in Neriak.  Oh another thing I see when I get
to level 40 or somthing its one of the higher up levels anyway I can
get summon corpse. What is the diffrence between the 2 spells. and
also when I use the spell will I get all my gear back.

thanks in Advance Nightwind
