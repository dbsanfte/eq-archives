*cry* I run my machines at a really high resolutions, I like the space,
its comforting.  So, I come back from lunch and my monitor is black, I
check all connections, unplug the monitor, reboot the machine.  No luck,
not working.  I ask for a new monitor and all they have is this PoS one.

So I went from a nice 17 inch monitor running at 1280 x 1040 at high color
to a 15 inch running at 640 x 480 at 16 colors. (it was the only monitor
they had remaining)  *cry* So here I am, with letters as big as houses,
typing this message.
