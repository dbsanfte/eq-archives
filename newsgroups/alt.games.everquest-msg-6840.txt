  I've been hunting in Najena for my mage focus items.
  Being lvl 27 and not able to find a group, I was simply hunting some =
tentacles and Darkboned skeletons.
  =20
  After a few rounds of killing and medding a lvl 22 ranger joined me so =
the nuking became a lot easier.
  =20
  After we killed a couple of Darkboned skeletons I looted and to my =
surprise: A Broom!=20
  First I was ecstatic, then it struck me: what the hell was a Broom =
doing on a skeleton? They are supposed to be only dropped by magicians =
in Najena, aren't they?
  =20
  The DBSkel was blue to me and I killed the spawn moments after it =
popped, so no player could have given the broom to it.
  =20
  Anyone able to verify this?

  btw: Didn't find any other last night, but I did find an item for the =
mage Epic (words of earth or something like that) which is now resting =
in the bank for a couple of months. This one was also dropped by a =
Darkboned Skeleton.
