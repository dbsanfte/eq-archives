   I didn't either, till I read Berryhill's post  (thank you!)
about do that and downloading the maps.  I just always assumed
that I was too dense to correctly figure out to use the feature
(which is still true enough, I guess).  
    I wasn't complaining about the LoY expansion, though.  I like
the extra bank space.  I look forward to the day that my
beastlord can fight in the new zones.  I appreciate the guild
tool.  And prismatic dyes have been very, very good to me.  I
estimate I've made about 3 or 4 k profit of of them, on Test,
where they are selling for only 40p each, and being fairly casual
about it.  But yeah, I thought the cartography system was pretty
much a waste also.
