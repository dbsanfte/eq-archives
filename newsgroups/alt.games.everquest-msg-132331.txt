The water dragon was never missing.  It spawns, it dies, it comes back in a
week to repeat the process.  That skeleton is put there purely as a warning
since it became "news" that you were able to bind there again.  Yes,
Faydedar wanders by there.  I've aggroed Faydedar a few times running out to
the firepots for a quick port.

As dragons go, he's fairly wimpy.  I have yet to die trying to reach the
firepots.
