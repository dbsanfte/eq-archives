uhm you do realize how you do this right? The leader of the group is a
caster bound at such a place that getting to the dungeon entrance is easy .
The leader ports to the start of the dungeon and invites each person as they
come in . They get cohed to wherever the staging ground is and then disband
so that another can be cohed . The exact same functionality except that it
requires 2 people instead of just one . 2 people instead of just one can log
out in traks lair for the next slaying (and face it ; if your guild can do
even the easy uber mobs then twinks abound to just sit around , especially
twinks like magicians who have somewhat limited use .)

In other words when they backed out the changes not much changed . They also
managed to annoy some people . bravo .
