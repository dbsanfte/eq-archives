Actually a non technicaly inclined person would not have upgraded
their firmware(BIOS) in the first place.  They would not know that
it's needed, however, there was a problem, and Linksys fixed it pretty
quick.  Before that time I have had no problem with Linksys.  Also
I've run into a couple of people who have Netgear routers and have had
problems with online gaming, the reason you don't hear anything about
it is because Linksys is a much larger name then Netgear (Linksys has
39% of the SOHO market, Netgear has maybe 5-7%).
