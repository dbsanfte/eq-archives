    I see it going the opposite way. If you go to area X and it's
overcrowded, at present I grit my teeth and stay OR log to an alt because
travel has a fair amount of downtime associated with it and there's no
guarantees that the place I'm going will be any better. If travel was easy,
I'd leave in a heartbeat to try and find someplace better. I think it might
also aid people who honestly WANT to go to uncamped areas.

    And because other people are there. My warrior isn't in DL because she
enjoys the ambiance of Gorenaire shouting about killing fool druids in
wolfform - she's there because within a few minutes of /ooc'ing and putting
up the LFG flag she's fighting in a group.

    Ding ding ding! Right now, druids and wizards can ALWAYS raise cash by
being porters. This is especially true in some places - I generally don't
hear port requests at the Thurg bank for less than 50 pp. If travel becomes
easy, you've taken away a big source of cash for them.

    Now look at a Stonebrunt group. If everyone could get to Tox without a
porter, how likely is it a druid or wizard will be in the party? Now same
situation, only you need a porter or have to take the boat to get there? It
would have an impact.
