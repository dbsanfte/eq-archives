I'm playing it right now as a substitute for EQ, and like it. It's 
generally an EQ-light -- it requires less time yet feeds the same 
addiction type, just in smaller quantities. If I still had as much time 
as I did when I was in EQ, I would not have quit it in the first place 
to switch to DAOC.
Generally it goes like this:
1) In DAOC, fighting monsters is less challenging, though not completely 
trivial
2) In DAOC most classes can solo effectively, although it will not be as 
fast of levelling as in a good group
3) In DAOC it's possible to drop into the game for an hour and still 
accomplish something
4) The death penalties (imo) are less harsh, although they are still 
present
5) You have greater choice of what type of char you are playing, there 
are no single correct ways to play something, nor are there required 
classes like in EQ (oh, we can't do it without an enchanter, or warrior 
with defensive disc)
6) RvR can be fun, but it starts at higher levels. Essentially it's like 
higher level raids in EQ, except you're killing other people with (in 
some cases) better AI than monsters
7) Less downtime, more things to do for melee classes (as opposed to 
taunt-kick/taunt-kick)
8) There's barely any camping required. On the other hand there's much 
less choices of equipment
