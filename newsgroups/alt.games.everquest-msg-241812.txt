In spite of the fact it's a common hispanic name, no. Among most
Christian cultures, mention "Jesus", and Christ comes to mind. There
are certain exceptions to what I had stated, and those exceptions
should be obvious such as this one. There is no solidly defined line.
GM discretion makes the final decision as to whether a name is okay or
not.
