I liked playing cleric.  Liked it a lot actually.  I also happen to enjoy other
classes, but thats not really what drove me away, it was rather that I wasn't
getting any group invites to play cleric, only raid invites (if you want to call
the imperius demands, the whining and pleading, the snooty disdain "invites").
And the fact that I was getting hassled for not having MGB.. which you get not
from raiding but from exp camping.

Cleric is a fun class to play, if you don't let people stick you in a "med and
heal" box... there -are- places where thats appropriate, but there's a lot more
to the class than the people running clerics as BOTs might guess.  When I
stopped getting the opportunity to do anything but that, well yes, the class
sure starts to pale.

But I stopped playing cleric more because I got tired of the pressures to do
things I didn't want to do, and the dissapointment of not being able to get
groups and just play rather than spend my life in perpetual raid mode or wait
for raid mode LFG that got to me.

I did think it telling when they said "I hate to lose a resource like that".
Resource am I?  Sure sounds like what I signed up for, bunch of people I think
are friends who think of me like some kind of oil well of healing for their
raids.
