	Heh, now imagine doing it in Hate.

	Because of the insanely low drop rate on the Shattered Emerald of
Corruption (one Ranger on the server killed 600 bosses with no drops -- other
servers are reporting one or two drops per raid so it's possible that it's
just broken on E'ci), I'm going on every Hate raid I can squirm into.
Needless to say, there is nothing else for me on a first-floor raid (I have
the whip and the boots), so this is about as much fun as a high colonic.

	And, that's what we're looking forward to in Luclin.
