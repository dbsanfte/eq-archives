 After 50 levels and more than a few rearrangements I've settled on
leaving all the lower level (40 and below about) at the beginning,
all my "sight" spells except invis and see invis (bindsight, truenorth,
glimpse and it's variations, etc.) in a big clump about half way though,
then my lesser used 40+ level spells in a clump, then all my gates and
portals in a big somewhat organized clump, then the spells I use all
the time (level 49+ and see invis and invis). I have a hot key that 
does a /book 25 that opens the book to the page with all my most used
spells and go forward and backward as needed.
 
 Works well for me.
