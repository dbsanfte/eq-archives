Hmm 10 arrows per stack for silver combine.....didnt know that...its seems
a bit weird, but hey if it works, it works. Silver has its uses in
fighting sice it can hit magic only mobs....I really am using arrows to up
my skill for making good bows.

I dont know....I try to keep a sensible dex to help my melee weaps proc. I
did empirically notice that when I bought some gear that combined gave me
7 extra points of dex pushing me past 90 that my crits happened more
frequently and did more damage by a coupla points with arrows....maybe a
statistical event, maybe a real dex difference.
