Someone investigated the issue. Appears that Freedom Force was already 
running in a compatibility mode on anything other than 98,  with a 
protected Heap. The reason is it doesn't handle it's heap calls by the 
book, but in a faster, undocumented way that works ok in 98 and Me. In 
2000 or XP it corrupts the heap and crashes windows badly. Windows 2000 
and XP run it in it's own little Heap area, working in 98 mode, to allow 
it to work. XP SP2 as a security measure won't allow that mode if the 
program is to wild with it. Which apparantly Freedom Force is. 
Apparently you can dig this up by installing the Windows Compatibility 
tool kit SDK and using it to query the Freedom Force Executable.

Course that could all be some pissed off nerd blowing smoke up my ass... 
I just know it won't run. (picked it up for $5 at a Big Lots of all 
places, last week) And it's one of maybe 4 games on the list of 'this 
worked in Xp, but not with SP2' stuff. Almost every other piece of 
software was security related.

As far as SP2, I've had it go completely foobar so far 6 times on 
install. Twice it was due to spyware, and is now documented on MS's 
site. One was a lurking hardware problem. The other three we couldn't 
figure out, just had to nuke and start over.

All that being said, I wouldn't be putting forth my proper MS attitiude 
without the following: Microsoft sucks ass.
