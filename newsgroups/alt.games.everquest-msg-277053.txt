I have primarily plaed on SolRo, and got merged into BB. But some of
the /oocs in BB mention wanting to take advantage of the move option to
go to other servers had me wondering: are there differences between
server populations in terms of "character", helpfulness, rowdiness,
groupabily, etc. I am disregarding differences due to population size
and due to PvP rules or roleplaying rules.

Basically, do servers have reputations.
