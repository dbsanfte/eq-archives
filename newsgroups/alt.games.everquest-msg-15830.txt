Alright what am I doing wrong I have a 42 Monk with a pair of Wus Trance
Sticks and FBSS. Mainly group with Guild 38 Warrior a 39 Ranger and 40
Cleric and Druid. Being I have the highest AC in the group 806 unbuffed I
can't get them off the ranger she gets pounded on. and comes very close to
be killed by Wrums. I go in full attack, kicking (113 max kick) attemting to
Disarm nothing seems to work to get the mob off the ranger. Even when I pull
as soon as the ranger attacks the mob shift over the the ranger. I am
looking for new ways to get higher on the hate list.
