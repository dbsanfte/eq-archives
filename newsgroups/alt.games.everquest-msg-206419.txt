And of course these three abilities stack, forage, fish, and enchant all at the
same time, practically no risk and three income streams, pretty sweet.

A Karana druid can get some pretty decent milage by foraging plains pebbles and
imbuing them while hunting spider silks in EK, but thats only two revenue
streams... and the plains pebble one isn't all that lucrative since you do have
to forage them, while the emeralds you can buy as many of as you can afford.
On the bright side, you can also forage cabbages in the same zone, and the silk
thing is a decent way to make money at a fairly low level.
