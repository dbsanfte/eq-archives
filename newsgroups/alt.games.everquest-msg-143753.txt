Am I absurdly sensitive?  It seems any time you mention anybody on my side
of the spectrum, it's with venom...

Yes, and no.  The ACLU supports some things that I find absolutely abhorrid,
which is why I can't support them full-on.  OTOH, they do fight some
important battles.  You've heard the most recent one, neh?  I forget which
state this happened in, but some teenagers were photographed, and put in
police files because they were considered likely suspects for crimes that
_may_ be committed some time in the _future_.  I guess being "at risk" is
now a crime.

When the Constitution says "no law," it means "no law."  The implies for, or
against.

I'm not putting the words in your mouth, I'm only going by what you write.
