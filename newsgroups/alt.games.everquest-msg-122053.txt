    Heh - I JUST got to 20 K for the first time in my playing career, and
that was by selling a Mana Preservation III item off my monk for 15 K.

    Imbued Emeralds are the bottleneck? Buy an emerald off a vendor, hand it
to a high elf cleric (or a cleric like me that beat the nerf - I can imbue
just about anything). The mana vial is tougher than that, since it requires
a higher-level enchanter and the sapphires are more expensive. The REAL
bottleneck is the Divine Crystalline Glaze - the Iron Oxide spawns in
Steamfront are now perma-camped on my server, which means killing elementals
for the rare drop IO. Truth be told, if you had a level 8 enchanter to be an
Enchant Clay mule for you and a Geerlock pottery item you could get to 220s
or so in pottery quite cheaply, which is enough to have about a 30% shot at
the Idol. The expense at the Opal Encrusted Stein stage would be partially
offset by Stein sales to some degree - I can usually sell a half dozen every
time I log in the sales mule, at 75 pp each.

    The robe is a bottleneck for the quest as a whole, since 250 skill
tailors are not easy to find. I might end up pruchasing that from someone on
our server that sells them for 4 K each.

    Get a group and go whack them between mushroom pulls. They drop the junk
you need fairly often.

    Right now I have my Pie, Champagne, Picnic, and Stein finished. I have
the Sickle pieces ready for our 250 smith to hit "combine" on (and can make
them again if required with my 180 + Geerlock smithing), a 200 Fishing
guildmate is hitting combine for several of us to get the Pole, a guildmate
is giving me some Cabbages in exchange for my imbuing work (and at 182
Baking I can do the combine easy), and if I'm lazy and don't want to take my
time with my 196 + Geerlock Pottery making the Idol a guildmate at 230 +
Geerlock will do it for materials. Just that damned Robe to really arrange -
have to send that tailor a tell today.
