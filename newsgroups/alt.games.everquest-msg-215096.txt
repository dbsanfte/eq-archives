    A guild wouldn't waste time raiding to piece together something like
that, though. That's why I said it would be of interest to individuals, but
likely not to a guild.

    Having said that, the only loot item I've seen that was supposedly from
an LDoN raid was very nice. 130 HP/140 MANA ring, 10 all saves, FT V. The
reports I've seen indicate that it may not be good risk versus reward, but
it sounds challenging and it's better than nothing on days when everything
worthwhile is dead!
