	No, but you're the only one who sees it they way you do. The
biggest problem is that /Verant/ doesn't know what's exploiting and what
isn't, and that, in this case, their explanations for why what Conquest was
doing was exploitative don't hold water.

	The /only/ people who can say what's exploit and what's tactic are
Verant. Verant doesn't even know internally. They just let the GMs whim it
and back up the GM using whatever broken logic seems to fit their purposes
if they have to.

	That is clearly the case here.

	Warders still drop cloth caps. I don't care what Ester says, that's
broken.

	VI knew about the res and snare trick for Ventani and Hraashna
respectively, before they banned Conquest. They didn't fix it. That's
broken.

	Sleeper's is /mostly/ finished, but it is not done.

	Tactics can be anything you want them to be. We use charsima
buffs to overwrite lure-based silences. Is that exploiting? I don't think
so, I think that's a completely valid tactic to work around a MOB ability.

	And what's the difference, really, between that and keeping a buff
(or debuff in this case) on you in order to work around a MOB ability? I
don't see any.

	Snare is questionable, sure, but only because it requires you to
duel and camp out in order to pull it off. On PvP servers, I think that'd
be perfectly acceptable and within the scope of the game.

	When I first heard about Snare and Res effects I actually thought,
however briefly, "Wow! That's really cool. Verant wants you to harm yourself
in order to accomplish some really hard encounters. They really got their
act together to be thinking of stuff like that!"

	Which, of course, was followed by, "Oh, wait, it's Verant. They
probably just didn't see it coming even though it's been used in VP for
a dog's age."
