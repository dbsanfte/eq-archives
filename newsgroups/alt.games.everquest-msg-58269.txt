    Impressive.  I thought the fish rolls lasted 
damned near forever.  Marinated muskie must have 
the staying power of a friggin' fruitcake, for
heavens sake.

   Not true, my friend, if I am reading your 
post right.  Simply place any stat increasing
food in the first slot of your first backpack.
You will see you increase in your numbers.
Honest.  Swear to God.  I've tested it many, 
many times.  What I do is place my stat
enhancing food (halfling toes) in that slot, 
then put a stack of foraged food in one of my
general slots, since that's where food must
be to be force fed.  After every battle, I try
to force feed myself.  I've never actually 
eaten any halfing toes, but have enjoyed the
benefits of the stat increase.

    *Sob*  I hate to see you driven insane
over a stylistic issue.  Perhaps you should
take some prozac.  Lots of it.   And pass it
around to some of the more pugilistic members
of the newsgroup.  It couldn't hurt, now could
it?
