I am both excited and apprehensive about recent reports from the alpha
community (including the excellent Graffe write-up). The game looks
incredible, but ...  everyone mentions how solo-able every class is and
Blizzard appears to have made some effort to make each class independent.
This always sounds like a great idea in theory, but what I've learned from
other MMOGs is that unless there are strong incentives for group play
(class-dependence being only one of them), you wind up with a MMOG full of
solo-ing characters.

Nowhere was this more evident than in Star Wars Galaxies, where I never felt
there was any need to group with others, and small cliques of duos and
soloers pretty much dominated the game. This may be deliriously exciting for
many, but I found it very un-fun and unexciting. Yes, I know SWG had scores
of other problems and I know those all contributed, but my point remains
that one of its worst flaws was the virtually complete independence of every
player. I couldn't believe how much I missed having the expertise of a
well-played Cleric, or a well-played Shaman, around. The great sense of team
accomplishment that occurs when all the pieces are working together like the
proverbial well-oiled machine, is one of the great unsung virtues of
EverQuest, even while many people claim it's the primary fault. This is why
I ultimately came back to EverQuest.

I hope the guys designing WoW have figured this out and have balanced their
game to strongly incent team play and some level of group dependence as
opposed to class dependence. I'm looking forward to hearing how this plays
out.
