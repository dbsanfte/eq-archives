Here's a bit of news you may not know... petitions don't expire anymore, at
least not on Bertox, and they stay in the queue across characters too. I
petitioned a request night before last on my cleric, was playing my wiz the
following night when another petition need came up, tried to and couldn't.
Said I had one in the queue. Since nothing showed on /viewpetition, I did
the unthinkable and sent a guide a direct tell. She informed me that I still
had one in the queue from my cleric. Less than 10 minutes later a real GM
sent me a tell and told me she was fixing a_cleric_problem_01, again I was
still on my wiz. then she directly handled a_wiz_problem_01 and I was all
set.

Just fyi.
