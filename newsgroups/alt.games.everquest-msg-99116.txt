Hmmm.....  Try cutting all your visuals down to minimum.  I think this can
be done in game in the "old" interface under options. Also, as EQ is loading
there is an "Options" button there also, on the same screen as the "Connect"
button.  Click that and deselect all the options there.  They may do the
same things, I couldn't get on this morning so I can't be 100% sure if they
are the same.  EQ will probably look plain afterwards but try that and see
if it works when you get to those areas you mentioned.  If so, you can
slowly add textures and such until you reach the break point, then back off
a notch or two.  Hope this helps.
