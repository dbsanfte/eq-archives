The only change I noticed is that there are now two gems dealers in
North Freeport (one in the bank, one in the old blue building).  Also
the metals vendor now has her metals at the top so you don't have to
scroll down (wish they'd do that to every metal vendor!).

And they sell Fire Opals!  Wootness!

I'm sure there are other changes but this is going to make it much
easier to do jewelcrafting in Freeport.
