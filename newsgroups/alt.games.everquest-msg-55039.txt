Pretty much in the same way that dodge ball on a playground compares
to the World Series of professional baseball (make whichever one dodge
ball which you want) They are totally unrelated. Mainly Baldur's Gate
is a one person game with an end and can probably get got through in
45 hours. Everquest is a 2,000 or so people playing on the same server
at the same time with you game with no end in site where in 45 hours
you get to level 15 or 20 perhaps and you won't see max level for
possibly 65 real time days of play or more.

Baldur's gate might be a game you play because computer gaming is a
hobby of yours while Everquest is a hobby you have because computer
gaming WAS a hobby of yours ;)

Hmm you had rather fundamental questions which could have been
answered by

www.everquest.com 

in less time then posting here took. Click the everquest live 
part to get to the actual information page from the storefront that
they made the first page on the site now (rather an odd thing to do)
