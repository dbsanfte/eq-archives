Obviously this is a discussion of *opinions* at this point, so as usual,
I'll feel free to jump in with mine. ;-)

The outdoor zones of EQ are beautifully designed. They should be
enjoyed. It's possible for some classes to use them to solo to sixty,
and for the rest to group in some, I guess, and do that as well. Nothing
wrong with that.

However, it is a loot based game which is centered on combat, action,
and adventure. (Tradeskills, etc. not withstanding.) And the dungeons
are where the highest level of danger and the greatest rewards in terms
of loot are. That's not my opinion. That's how the designers made the
game. A quick check of the online beastiearies, zone guides, etc. will
tell you that. And yes. They are harder. A LOT harder.

And when I suddenly get grouped up in Seb or DN with "somebody's friend"
who was a three zoner, then yes... I find those skills lacking.

You can be skilled in an outdoor zone line hunting group, but not be
skilled in the "OH MY GOD THE SHIT HAS HIT THE FAN" type situations you
run into deep in the tough dungeons. It's just different. (Back to
opinion here, of course, but that's what I've seen.)

And, IMHO, I guarantee you are incorrect. I see stress situations on big
mobs and on large groups of "non-big" but tough mobs that call on people
to react in ways that you'll never be called on to do in outdoor zone
line groups. First time you try to make it through the City section of
The Hole with twelve people, and you get an overpull out of the bank,
you'll see shit happening that's never gone down in DL. he he he.

Just two coppers from another n00b 55 warrior who raids a fair bit.
