With the new code that allows you to stack items on your cursor you
can legally forage AFK in any safe place forever only pausing every
now and then to bash your hotkey or check the results.  Combine
foraging with spider silk farming in East Karana for example.

Ports can be very lucrative even now if you find someone for example
who is late for a Halls of Testing raid or Zland/Kland for example and
stuck in PoK.  500pp to port a party to Cobalt Scar and succor them
across Siren's Grotto is well worth it if their guild wins the race to
kill Klandicar or hit NToV.

If you can find dark blue xp mobs with good tradeskill drops
(Rockhoppers, stuff in Cobalt Scar) you can make some xp and good cash
at the same time.  Never vendor anything, check in Bazaar first to see
if there is a market for it.

Play banker/taxi in Rathe.  I had a friend who would do this when the
giants were heavily camped, offer to change gold for pp, buy FS
weapons for half what vendors will give or offer ports out to
encumbered melee.

Vendor mine.  Hit every Druid ring and see what players have sold to
the vendors, you'll almost always find stuff you can sell on in the
bazaar at a hefty profit.  OOC that you're porting out every time you
land and are finished checking the vendors, even if they only donate
10pp you were heading out already anyway!
