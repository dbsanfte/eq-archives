Last night, I levelled and can now make Maple Strongboxes.  To do so,
however I need an Iron Seet, which I can't make.

I can buy them for 10s from the broker.  Luckily, the end product
sells for 50s on the broker.         :)

In future, though, I'll be getting Iron Sheets from another crafter in
my guild.

Give it time - as thing change, prices go up and down.  In the
meantime, I'd recommend requesting what you need on the crafter
channel, as I'm sure you can get a much better deal there.

And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
