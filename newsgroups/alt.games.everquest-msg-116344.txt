Actually, I did the run without any outside help besides a SoW that lasted
from the Innothule/Sro zone to somewhere in the middle of the boat ride
through Iceclad (I also took advantage of the Soulbinder at the docks
though)

My original plan with him was really just to look around Kael.

I didn't manage to get him bound in Kael until later when I offered to help
a monk that was having trouble getting one corpse past a few spawns, I got
bound at the WL zone and a heroism in case I got agro so that I could move
the corpse a couple more steps.
