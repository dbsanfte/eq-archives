My suggestion is to hit the Needlite camp in Echo Caverns. Needlites hit
*fast*, and if you have decent armor, they don't hit hard. But every time
a mob tries to hit you, there's a chance for your defense to go up. Get
an agility buff if you can before you go there: the higher your agility,
the more faster you'll learn. Heck, if you've got really good armor, don't
swing at them, just let them whale away on you!

It's been my experience that there's kind of a "skill hump" effect, where
skills start off slow to improve, but once you get to a certain level, the
improvements get faster. Sense Heading, for instance, can take an hour or
two of constant usage to get that first 10 points, but when I ding 21, it
only takes a few minutes to max it out for the level. My guess is that
once you get to ~30 defense, it'll really start taking off.

You're also in luck in that Needlites are a decent xp camp from 25-30 or
so.
