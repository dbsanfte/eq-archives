Might be majority, but there is certainly a large minority in there that
have systems well above even the recommended specs that are having all sorts
of problems.  I know of 2 guildies that have systems way above specs that
are having a lot of problems, both do have AMD processors.  I still have
some issues to resolve, but it is not unplayable for me.  My system is above
the recommended specs in most regards, and at least meets them in all
others.   I have had issues with LD, face settings changing, majorly low
frame rate in SoL zones (some worse than others, Shar Vhal being about the
worst).

I don't have any obscure hardware in my system, I don't have any just
released hardware in my system.

PIII-800
768MB PC133 CL2 SDRAM
GeForce2 MX400 64MB Video
Onboard Audio (Via chipset, yes I have done the updates)
40GB ATA-100 7200RPM IBM HD
NVidia Detonator driver version 23.11 (Latest)
Latest audio drivers from Microsoft
Win2k (with all recommended updates from MS)


The system ran absolutely great pre SoL, with only 256MB of PC133 CL3 SDRAM,
NVidia driver version 21.83 all else the same.  I did try 21.83 with my
current setup, I noticed no differences in performance between 21.83 and
23.11.
