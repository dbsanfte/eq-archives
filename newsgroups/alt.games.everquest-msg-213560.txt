Well Radient Cure (my shaman has level 3) isn't guaranteed to remove
everything, and quite often it only removes the first bad spell, so if your
in PoE and have malo on, then below that snare from a tree, it often leaves
snare

RC didn't work on Enlightenments AE (not that it matters now), don't think
it works on gravel rain, and does it work on Rathe Councilmen's earthern
vengeance? Don't recall so

Purify on the other hand will shift the lot

I recall a raid back on prexus, forget what it was.. anyway a cleric MGB'd
EE on inc, and was eaten within a second heh. I guess our own experiences
are what stick in our mind

Shrug you don't need to be full health, at this stage all priests are over
6k, melees are all 8k+, thats enough HP that 1 ae heal at a time will keep
everybody alive (ya, bit of a generalisation, but not unrealistic)
