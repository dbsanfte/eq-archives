An inappropriate name is that which a Guide or GM deems inappropriate. 
The guidelines are just that, guidelines to make it easier for you not to 
pick an inappropriate name. If in spite of the guidelines you manage to 
come up with an improper name, well, tough luck. You can't expect the 
guidelines to contain every possible instance of every name that would be 
inappropriate.

For me, Xtermi Nator, is a very self-evidently non-fantasy name and quite 
obviously inappropriate. If your friend isn't a fan of Fantasy 
literature, and hence cannot come up with an appropriate Fantasy name by 
himself, the game very helpfully provides a Fantasy name generator. Maybe 
he ought to use it.
