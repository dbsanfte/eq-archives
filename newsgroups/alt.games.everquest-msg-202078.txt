Understandable. It really comes down to what each guild wants to do. I'm
currently thinking of it in various dichotomies;

Firstly I think there are two sorts of guilds; those with lvl 60's (i.e.
established players) and those with lesse chr's (mixture of new and
established players). I think each has different needs in membership.
The newer players don't have the history and "social network" that
established player may have and tend to have a different outlook.

Another split would be guild purpose; loose or specific. Perhaps as
general as family, raiding, specific, etc.

Lastly, do you want to grow or not. Atm, my experience has been with a
few new guilds who want to grow and do this primarily by running around
inviting everyone. This I feel is a recipe for disaster.

I think you will find that if it is skillfully written, then yes. Think
about Monual's  (sp?) stories. I like reading these stories as both a
story and a learning technique. The group, the skills, the mistakes, the
tactics that worked and the results.
