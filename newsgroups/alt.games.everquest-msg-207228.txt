These zones are on Odus...  :)  To get to The Warrens, you have to go through
the Paineel Newbie zone and skirt around The Hole.  To get to Stonebrunt
(Ranger and Druid Paradise zone btw...) you go through the Warrens.  

Check out http://www.eqatlas.com for a really nice set of maps and information
on these zones.
