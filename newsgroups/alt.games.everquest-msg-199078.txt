So?   He's responding to a post which said -- in total -- this:

"If you made this statement vocal in game, i.e. "xx level cleric who
refuses to get KEI LFG", you will NEVER find a group. "

That's a reasonably accurate, if hyperbolic, statement.   As I said, both
that AND always having to have KEI to play (grouped, anyway) mark
whoever takes those positions as a moron, IMO.

Since we were talking about a hypothetical "xx level cleric who
refuses to get KEI", whether *this* poster refuses to run for KEI
is immaterial, isn't it?
