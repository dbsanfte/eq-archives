Hmmn - I can't figure out the "OMG - $10 dollars a month!" crowd out. Here
in Australia wages are low, tax is very high and our dollar has made like a
peso and bred to no noticable effect.

So - I earn 40K a year which is average for a working class schmoe at 30.
That makes about 20K US give or take an airfare. Thats before income tax of
over 30% and all the other levels of tax which starts off at a minumum of
10% gst but more often get's to around 30% and higher for the sorts of
things I get into: beer and computer games and going out getting drunk.

Now....

*runs figurea through Acountatron5000*

...that leaves me with exactly fuck all. But you know what? 10 bucks US (20
AUD) a month is still chicken feed to me...

*shrugs*
