Umm, he said "as if I have pushed the scan button" so how did you come 
up with that?

Are you certain there is nothing else running on your PC when you start 
EverQuest? It does not seem likely that the game would start your 
scanner. But it is entirely possible that something in memory, 
particulary the scanner software itself might be interacting with 
something and causing the problem. If your scanner came with software 
that say runs a process in the background all the time this may be the 
culprit. Any icon for your scanner software in the system tray all the 
time by any chance? I wonder if there's a hotkey something like that 
supports that's getting intercepted as you play EQ that fires up the 
scanner. Just some ideas.

I would suggest making sure there's nothing running in the system tray 
when you start EQ and also hitting control+alt+delete to bring up the 
task manager and killing anything in the applications window at a 
minimum before you run EQ. While in the task manager you might want to 
try clicking on the Processes tab and look at the list to see if you can 
identify any process running that looks from its name like it belongs to 
the scanner and click the End Process button to kill it if you find one.

Give that a little test and see how it goes. If that doesn't work maybe 
we can think of something else to try, such as firing up msconfig and 
booting into a system that has no other software running to test it out.

And if all that fails, I would contact tech support for your scanner and 
tell them what you are experiencing. They may have an idea about how the 
scanner could be triggered unexpectedly. Odds are if this is an issue 
with owners of this scanner, they have probably already heard about it 
and can tell you how to fix it.

Let us know how you make out.
