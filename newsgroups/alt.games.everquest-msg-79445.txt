Still gave decent (though not spectacular) xp for my necro at 24, which
is when I left.

Not quite. It's actually a random spawn table between the two. I've
shown up there and found *all* skeletons, (happens if the last camper
leaves either zero or one garg... the skellies overwhelm them
eventually) and started killing skellies. Then, more skellies. *sigh*.
So it's not an alteranting table. Sometimes you have to kill a LOT of
skellies to get the first garg to pop. And if you're smart, you'll
*keep* killing skellies and protect that garg until a few more are up.
Then you can safely start pulling gargoyles.

The garg will always win a one-on-one fight, but he'll finish at fifty
to sixty percent health. If there's two of them, or if he paths into
another skellie right after that fight, he's toast.
