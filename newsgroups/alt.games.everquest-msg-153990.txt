It looks like you just ran into some stupid peeps, and you probably did
yourself a favour by not grouping with them.

There is nothing at all wrong with soloing, but as a paladin, you will not
be able to solo (without someone buffing you to the max beforehand) to the
highest levels. So if you want to get to level 60, you will have to group.
I play a paladin, and I have enjoyed and still do enjoy doing some solo
work, in befallen early on, I owned Unrest after I got instrument of nife,
and then in Lower Guk/CoM/DL skellies.
The problem I found was that there were many many places I could not even
step into without a group, so I was effectively shutting myself off for the
bulk of the zones/camps in the game.
If you dont mind not seeing all of these zones, and you are only interested
in levelling, thats fine.

Quite apart from that, grabbing a few friends to go into some god-forsaken
dungeon somewhere to find a specific item drop, is one of the most
satisifying parts of the game IMHO. Even when you dont get the drop, and as
long as you dont all die, you will have fun :).

I have a regular group of buddies now (some from my guild, and some not) who
get together most nights and go and adventure (a foreign concept to a lot of
EQers).

Make friends with a chanter, a cleric, a ranger/monk and a druid/wizzie and
pretty much any other class (I prefer a rogue, for lockpicks/traps and of
course huge damage) and you are all set.
BTW, druid/wizzies are an essential part of an adventuring group
(ports/evacs).

Try out new zones, get into places you would not normally see if soloing, or
if you take the Paludal/LOIO/OT/DL/KC route.

A lot of these dungeons have xp bonuses that the outdoor xp-grind zones dont
have, so you will level just as quickly if not quicker.

My two cents.
