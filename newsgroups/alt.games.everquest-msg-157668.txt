Throwing a couple MORE thoughts into this...

Another reason I absolutely love this expansion is in reaction to you saying
you are stuck.  Not attacking you at all Ronny, just made me starting
thinking, so branching off from your post here....

Throughout my cleric's life (and for that matter most of my various
characters) I have almost always avoided getting druid ports unless time was
actually an issue (going to rez a friend, going to a raid, etc) and run my
happy little cleric around the world.  Luclin has made this possible and I
have to say doing this has made me appreciate the world of Norrath a great
deal more.  Finding the best ways to get from place to place, seeing more of
the world, learning the patience of hitting Num Lock and sitting back and
watching the terrain slide by, etc. have all greatly enhanced my enjoyment
of the game.  One of those old wise statements is that the journey is the
thing, not the destination and I find this to be true in most areas of my
life including EQ.  Mind you this is with a CLERIC, not a bard or some class
equipped with SoW, so until I could afford to start keeping a nice regular
stock of SoW potions I did this all at normal slow running speed.  Is it
boring sometimes?  Yes (God yes with that run up/down the mountain pass to
HHP), do I wish I could just be there already sometimes? Yes.  Does it give
me a better feeling of reality (virtual of course, but still),
self-sufficiency, and personal accomplishment?  YES.  For that I think PoK
will actually somewhat open the world to some and give them more of a desire
to actually walk to their destination rather than POOF you're there, start
the grind.

Anyway, this ramble is ending now.
