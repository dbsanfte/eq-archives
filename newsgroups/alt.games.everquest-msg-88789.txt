Thanks, this is excellent... Well, some of it, at least. I think that 
trying to quad in Frontier mountains is as suicidal, if not more so, than 
quadding in Stonebrunt, for example, and there are many suggestions there 
that I refuse to take on roleplaying reasons alone (Dwarves? Wood 
Elves?), or because of simple respect for other players (quadding the 
Spectres in Oasis, for example... besides, aren't they casters?).

Still, there are many very good suggestions there. I'll probaby head to 
Eastern Wastes. I think I haven't got my money's worth out of Velious 
yet. =)
