I'm sure there are bards who play very well :) 
When my "harmony of nature" fails (rarely) I know it IMMEDIATELY, and run my
butt to the CC zone, sending a /ooc train warning.  I've never had the mobs run
OUT of the fort, they are always right on my butt, (having come through the
walls to beat on me).
I don't play a bard, so I have no idea how they do their thing.  I'm trying to
figure out how he can lose "control" (if he ever had it to start with) without
KNOWING there is a problem.
