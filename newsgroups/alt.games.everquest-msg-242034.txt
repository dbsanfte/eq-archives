3.5.1 Q: How do I get Alt+Tab to work for Windows XP

Windows XP keeps a list of program compatibility information. Up until
recently, EverQuest was not built to allow Alt + Tab, and so our executable
ended up in this list explicitly preventing the Alt + Tab functionality.
Obviously that has changed. We are working on getting that changed. But in
the meantime, if you are using Windows XP and you would like to enable Alt +
Tab, there is a way to get it to work.

First, you'll need the Windows Application Compatibility Toolkit. It's
nearly 7 megs.
http://download.microsoft.com/download/.NetStandardServer/Install/2.6/NT5XP/EN-US/act26.exe

You'll need to download and install the toolkit. Then:
Open the Compatibility Administration Tool.
At the top go to Search - Query.
Search for EverQuest.
Double click the item the search finds.
Right-Click the EQGame.exe entry and choose Disable.
