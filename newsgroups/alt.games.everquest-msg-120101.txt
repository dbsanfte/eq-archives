Bah, yer all nuts.  Ketchup/Catsup is part of an evil plot to nerf
the tomato experience and make it accessable to the kiddie/arcade
market, those who have neither the patience nor the intelligence
to meet the challenge of the "real" thing.  Why back in the day
we had to forage our own herbs and endure hundreds of hours of
failed combines getting our cooking skill up to where we could
reliably make a decent PastaSauce.  Then, and only then, did you
have any chance of success at making the true nectar of the gods:
PizzaSauce.  Of course, there have been many who tried to hunt for
their PizzaSauce, but it is such a rare drop that most have given up
the quest and now pretend that the common drop CatsupWithSomeBasil
is the real thing.  We few who have experienced the real thing will
not be fooled tho, and it is with real pity that we regard the poor
deluded fools who have fallen by the wayside.
