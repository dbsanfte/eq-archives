And we are quitting . And doing so in droves . Not only will trivial loot
code be the death of Eq , just the talk of its inclusion is hurting so much
more than they realize . People are just gone today that where here
yesterday and they are doing it solely over trivial loot code .

The really sad thing is that it is addressing a non problem, and doing so in
a hideous fashion.  There is absolutely no positives for me in the code and
the potential and foregone facts of some really nasty negatives . Even the
true newbie will be adversely effected in dramatic ways . The only people it
does help are those that wish to make a profit with multiple accounts and
computers by farming the mistakes that will be included in Luclin . The
mistakes are inevitable and verant is more prone than most to make them .
