There is -- or was -- a feature/bug/exploit which allows a
tradeskill class to scribe the level 10 books for the other
classes.   So you'd have the recipe for the maple quill and
caliun paper and could make them yourself.  The books cost
4s80c IIRC -- and a lot of people just traded for them (i.e.,
give someone a level 10 scholar for a level 10 craftsman,
etc.) or paid 10s for them.   They'd have a harder time
making pristine items without the second tier buffs, of course,
but with secondary components it doesn't matter anyway.

So you don't really *need* a mule (or another crafter) until
level 20 (unless the secondary component is level 11 or
higher.)
