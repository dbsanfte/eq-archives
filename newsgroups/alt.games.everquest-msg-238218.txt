You might be able to get decent exp there at 53, seems like once we
went in a little ways everything was blue to my 53 monk on our last
trip. We didn't stay too long though, the mobs were light blue to the
people that were 2 or 3 levels higher. You don't need the key to get
into the hole, with a bit of practice you can duck through a gap in
the rocks (if you aren't a large race). Faction for Paneel (to get the
key) is pretty trivial to get, just clear out mobs in the warrens. 

You might also want to check out the revamped CoM. If you go in a
little ways, everything should be dark blue to you and about half the
mobs there are undead.
