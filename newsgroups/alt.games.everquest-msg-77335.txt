SONH?? Get out of there and head to the Field of Bone - it is one of the
best newbie areas in the entire game (IMHO).  Just about level 5 is when you
are going to move into the pit.  Stay by the newbie ramp and you should be
ok.  You can make it all the way up to level 18ish in the pit and Kurns
Tower.

Happy Hunting
