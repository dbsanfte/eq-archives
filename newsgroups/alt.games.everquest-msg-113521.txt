  I haven't logged in yet to see how my connection fares since the patch,
but this might be to blame:

- No updates are sent when the player character is not moving, saving
resources.  We've also increased the rate that position updates are made by
moving player characters, using up some of those saved resources but making
movement a bit smoother

  Maybe the more frequent position updates are consuming more bandwidth than
Verant had anticipated.
