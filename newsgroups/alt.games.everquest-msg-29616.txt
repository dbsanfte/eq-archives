Incorrect, alas.

If you check back to 99/09/28, you'll find my message regarding this.
I managed to duplicate every piece of equipment and bit of cash on me.
My "prize" was that I got the opportunity to sit and do next to
nothing for 5 hours in-game waiting for a GM to show up to destroy all
of the extra material.  (Apparently a mere Guide was unable to click
"destroy" on things.)

Yes, they originally (back when I started) stated such a thing.
However, to the best of my knowledge it has never been done.
