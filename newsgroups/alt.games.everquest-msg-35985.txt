Thirty-eight levels and I still move the cursor over to the name of the
group members in the group list on the right side of the screen ... click on
it ... move cursor over to my social keys on the left side of the screen and
click on stand ... move up my keys ... click on the appropriate heal social
key ... move down and click on sit.  Very inefficient.  Have accidentally
clicked on and even healed mobs.  Time to break this bad habit and become
more smoother and efficient.  Here's what I think will do the job.  Tell me
what you think.

1) No more clicking on names and using the F1, F2, F3, etc. keys.  However,
is there a way to rearrange the group list?  I've got one of those ergonomic
split keyboards and would like to always have the pulling tank at F5 and
receiving tank at F4 so I can target by touch.  The keyboard splits between
F5 and F6.

2) No more clicking on the social keys.  Using my keyboard number keys to
active my social keys.  Here's what I think what they should be:

Best heal spell key.  In sixth slot (ergo keyboard splits numbers at 6).
This way I can rest my index finger on the number 6 key, my middle finger on
the F5 key, and my ring finger on F4.  Social key coded as followed:

/stand
/doability 1
/g Healing %t.
/cast 1
/sit

FYI: "/doability 1" is Sense Heading so I'm always keeping it at its max.

Second best heal.  This one I use to mop up the little damage that my best
heal doesn't do without wasting the mana on it and when pulls are slow.
Currently, my best heal is Superior Healing thus my mop-up heal is Greater
Healing.

/stand
/doability 1
/g Healing %t.
/cast 2
/sit

My Out of Mana ("Out of mana.  Medding.") button would be in the seventh
slot (again, due to ergo keyboard break).  Low on Mana ("Low on mana.  20%
or less as of this moment.") key being in the eighth slot.  Putting
Spellbook Main button on the first slot.  Sit/Stand Main button on the
second slot.  Last two slots I've been putting in my non-component AC and HP
buffs (currently Guard and Valor), but only so I can make a social to raise
my Sense Heading.  Anyone got a better thing to do with these two slots?
Anyone have a better arrangement or suggestion for any or all these slots?

By using the F and number keys to do heals, I would then rest my cursor on
the Divine Barrier gem for when things hit the fan.  Gate gem being right
below it for when the fan hits us.

Also lately, I've been having no damage spells in my mem roster.  Here's my
typical mem roster:

Superior Healing
Greater Healing
Guard
Valor
Symbol of Pinzarn*
Armor of Protection
Divine Barrier
Gate

* I used to complain about casting Symbol of Pinzarn due to the cost, but
have found a greenie zone where the mobs are easy to kill and drop a lot of
plat and so-so loot (average about 50 plat an hour).  So when my bank
account gets too low, I simply go there for four hours and walk out with 200
plat.  Thus I've been quite free and loose with my Symbol spells of late and
put it on everyone in the group.  However, the component "only" costs me a
little over a plat each so I might change once it starts costing more.  Then
again, I'm about to reach 39th level when I get my first XP rez and expect
to switch to using donations from casting it to pay for my component spells.
Though any tank or caster reading this I would STRONGLY encourage you to
carry a stack of the components and give your cleric them (a few or the
whole stack) when you join them.  You'll make good friends with clerics and
never be without a Symbol spell on you, even if you're not the pulling tank.

Now I know chanters who are constantly swapping out spells in their
spellbooks and not sure if I should be doing the same.  For example, the AC
and HP buffs last a long time and normally I can recast them during a
downtime between battles.  Not always, but most of the times.  Also they
suck so much mana out of me that it really needs to be during the downtime
for anyone but the pulling and receiving tanks and the enchanter.  I've
thought of putting in the three stun spells (Stun, Holy Might, and Force),
but not sure if they're really mana efficient and they seem to get resisted
a LOT.  Also I'd only think I'd use them if there wasn't a druid or chanter
(shammy?) in the group since they're better stun guns than I am.  Stuns
don't stack, right?  Only the best one applies or is it the first one
successfully cast on the mob sticks and subsequent ones are ignored?
