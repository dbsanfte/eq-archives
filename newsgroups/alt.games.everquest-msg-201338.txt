Agree on all points.  I got married afer I quit playing, but my wife showed 
some interest in the game so I dug it out again.  With the original rules, 
she would have been overwhelmed because she just enjoys playing the game 
and trouncing all over me with green fatties and not worrying about which 
stack is resolving when.  That's definitely a plus because it gives us a 
game that we can break out now and then without wasting time poring over 
rulings.
