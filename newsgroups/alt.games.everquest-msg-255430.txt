That sort of thing hasn't worked yet in mmorpgs. Maybe someday but I
wouldn't bet on it.

I don't feel like a pawn when I am raiding.

You're just realizing this now?

One of these days I will type out the mmorpg I want. I have a boring
job that lets me think about these things; I have it all worked out.
Man it would be a great game. Would meld together elements from EQ,
UO, DAoC, and Settlers, among other things. It would be an rpg in the
real form; primary focus on world elements not gameyness.
