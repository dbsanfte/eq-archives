If you get into a group that averages L58+ your XP per mission at L56
will double.  Of course, the mobs will be tougher, roughly 25% to 30%
of the "trash' will be L56 and so cannot be Lulled by a Paladin.  With
a L61 puller who understands how to ask for an assist pacify here and
there it's quite easy tho.  With a L60+ Enchanter likewise.  One note,
especially if your tank is underleveled (as I was), don't let your
tank's HP be under 2.5k or so at the start of a pull.  Waiting until
after the pull to CH is a false economy by the Cleric, because a couple
missed resists and in less than 5 seconds you can go from rolling along
on cruise control to burning off everybody's mana surviving an overpull
with a dead tank.  (She only got me killed that way once.)
