Oh this is a fun game!  Okay it's my turn...Take a cleric, and throw
away his healing ability, and his ability to Res, and his armor, and
his toes, and any feeling of self worth and what do you have?  A whole
lot less, maybe nothign at all.  okay quick!  Someone do...Enchanter!

First off, I said I was a new level 9.. and my pet was a white con,
and as such it was, with me, the lowest level in the group.  

Second, I am not talknig about Plane Raids or guild raids whatever
right now....I am talking about having FUN with what I am doing and
helping others have FUN.

I have a lvl 50 toon, and have never accepted uber guild invites or
anything that would lead to guild raids for uber twinking or anything.
To me this is not that fun.

For any newby reading this thread, don't concern your self with Guild
raids when you create a character.....make a character that is FUN for
you.  If you get the most enjoyment out of a level 1 insurance
salesman, then by the Gods go create that character and live it well!
For me right now, I am loving the shit out of my necro, and will
probably continue to do so as I grow with it.   


OKay all jokes aside, friend, My only real point to this babble is
that we ALL pay our 9.89 , and we ALL find fun in different ways.

Nick
