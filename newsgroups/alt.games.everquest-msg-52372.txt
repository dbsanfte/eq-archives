Ahhh, well here is a copy of what may be KH's first posting of his
remarks on the subject of games, rules and oklahoma pasted in from my
archives.  Hopefully the formatting will remain intact as will his
point, not all forms of playing a game are valid in multiplayer games,
even if some consider it fun.  I believe he also posted a more polished
version, but this is the one I found first, so apologies to KH wherever 
you are.
