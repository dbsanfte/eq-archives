Well, you did better than we did. :-(

Got some help and went to do the final turnin. At first the NPCs just 
stood around there for a while, then finally Abrogast headed out on his 
way to the bank. Miller stayed behind. Problem is, Abrogast wound up 
standing out in the courtyard looking stupid. Then Miller takes off and 
heads over to the bank. Abrogast still in the courtyard. I waited in the 
bank, then see the message you are supposed to see, and Miller takes off 
out of the bank, swords drawn. We had no choice but to attack him. 
Abrogast joined in the fight, having never entered the bank. We killed 
them both, and Miller dropped his bit of the reward, but Abrogast 
dropped only junk, not the clasp needed to make the cloak.

I have a petition in, got answered by a guide and a GM e-mailed me last 
night. I answered the e-mail and am waiting to see what comes of it, but 
not with much hope.
