| I just logged in (didn't have to patch, even, going to do that now).  One
| thing I noticed is that decaying skeletons in  were using a new model (or
| have they for awhile and I didn't notice).

if the patch/bug fix only concerns the server side software and not the
client side (the bit on your pc) then you won't see a patch.
