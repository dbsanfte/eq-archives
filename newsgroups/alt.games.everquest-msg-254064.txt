Shaman have 2 lines of slows, Turgurs et al, which is a magic resist based
slow (up to 75% at highest level) and then the Plague of Insects / Cloud of
Grummus set which is diseased based.

The ones you saw being resisted would have been magic based.  Shaman debuff
line (Malo-x) debuffs Magic, Fire, Cold and Poison.  We also have the
Insidious Decay et al line which debuffs Disease only.  Obviously, depending
upon which slow you are trying to land determines which debuff you cast
first.  At higher levels, our Malo / Malos and Insidious Decay / Malicious
Decay spells are unresistable.

The magic based slow Turgurs is a 75% slow, where Cloud of Grummos (disease)
is only 40%, however in magic immune mobs, 40% slow is much better than zero
% slow.


FYI for some great shaman information, try
http://morelight.org/samanna/info_shaman.html (Samana's Reference)

and

http://www.users.qwest.net/~taleisin/pages/shamanspelllines.htm which has
the shaman spells in easy to read chart form.

Hope this helps alittle explain shaman slows / debuffs.  If not, I'm sure
I'll be corrected.
