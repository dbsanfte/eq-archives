I'm not sure exactly what it means, but if it means no more interdependency
between classes, they're about to take away the only reason I see for
crafting. Standing in front of a tradeskill device and pressing buttons is
only fun to point. I don't care if it's the quickest way to get money and
status.

For me, it's the partnerships that evolve naturally over time that I find
interesting and challenging. To me, a returned favor followed by a "thanks,
buddy" is much more rewarding than some figures in my inventory or persona
windows.

Anyway, I refuse to believe they're stupid enough to make such a drastic
change.
