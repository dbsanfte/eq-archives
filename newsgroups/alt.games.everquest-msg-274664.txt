Seems to have.  I went to DL last night and found it back to normal.
However, FV's little town is now inhabited by inkie guards and cliff
golems.  I dropped a few cliff golems to see what was up, but only got
a stack of lvl 50-60 spells and a few pieces of something that seems
to be for tradeskilling (star-something ore?).  They summon and seem
to have a lot of hitpoints for their level, but weren't too tough.
Spawn rates were slow enough that I elected not to grind there, but
was fun to "open up" the town a bit for others.

After a bit of exploring, I found all the regular FV residents tucked
on a little peninsula off to the east of the zone.   Upon reflection,
I never saw Al'Kabor though.  Maybe I missed him?
