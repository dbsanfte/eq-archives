Read first *then* make your character.  EQ is hugeass - prepare yourself.
Everything you need to know about where to hunt with what classes, what
spells to have and what they cost and at what level....ALL of that and more
are on the sites people will link to for you in this thread.  Print out all
the maps and spell lists.  Read the newbie hunting and character creation
guides.  Then go back and delete anything you made prior to gaining all of
that information that's actually going to help you kickass in EQ.

Out of curiosity, what character(s) did you try already?
