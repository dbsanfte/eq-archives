Hiyas,

I currently have a pretty old Machine P2 233 with a Voodoo Banshee,

A while back Verant said they're was a problem with Banshee's and made is so
that only D3D worked with them. I instantly notice the image quality got far
worse, not to mention performance.

Luckily I stumbled onto a web site which for some reason allows me to still
use Glide with my Banshee while playing EQ, despite Verant saying it didn't.
The image quality went back up to what it was as did the performance.

Now that I'm buying a new computer and have a Geoforce2 Ultra, I've noticed
this drop in image quality again. Is the only answer to keep simply
increasing the resolution in the game to make it look better? or is there
another answer??

I take it this is to do with the outdated graphics engine behind Eq but I
was under the impression that the recent update to Direct X7 solved this.

All the other programs I have seem to look far better so I assume this is a
EQ thing.

Thanks for your help.
