I am trying to make the newbie armor for my lvl 11 Genome Necro.  This is my
first Genome character and I am not familiar with Steamfont area.  I found
the mob that drops most of the components for the armor.  But yellow recluse
silk is a problem.  All the time while I was hunting around I only saw
yellow giant spider once.  It had no silk.  Is yellow recluse silk a rare
drop?  What do I need to kill to bring out the recluse spider?  Or am I
looking for it in a wrong area: I hunt around Steamfont newbie area.

Emilio.
