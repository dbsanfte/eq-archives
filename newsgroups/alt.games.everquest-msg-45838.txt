I am getting tired of having to have others buy Cats Eye Agate for me in
freeport just because the Mage's guild doesnt like Dwarves any ideas on how
to increase my faction with them if it is possible?  Or is thr a location
near FP whr i can buy it?
Can seem to find any info on it at Al's or eq traders....
