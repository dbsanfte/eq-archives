If you were lower lvl and this happened, I'd say you were trying to
hold a camp that you obviously couldn't by yourself since there were
mobs up for these other people to engage. Anybody can claim a camp,
hell I've seen people claim an entire zone, but if you aren't keeping
the mobs clear in your 'camp' you don't really have a leg to stand on.

Mobs were up, they walked into the throne room and started killing
them, what's so hard to understand? 

Now if you'd actually kept it cleared, they would have walked in, seen
an empty room and either moved on or talked to you. The advantage of
having cleared a camp is that you know when and where the next mob
will spawn so you can pretty much count on being able to engage first.
... and it's not like you had to worry about them KSing you. 

If you, Mr. Level43, are in Crushbone clearing the throne room, why in
the hell where there mobs up for these other characters to attack? If
you're gonna claim a camp spot, clear the mobs and keep 'em cleared.
You're gonna claim a camp spot, leave mobs up and then bitch because
people 30 levels lower than you wandered in and engage them? 

Either you were lazy, afk, off killing something else at the time or
just plain making up part of it.

God forbid that people disagree with you.
