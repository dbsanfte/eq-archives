 There are two ways I know of to get +VentrilSathir faction, which is
the faction that the outpost is on. One is killing Kunark Dragons (and
Esorpa of the Ring in WW). The other is the warbraids quest. Turn in 4
sarnak warbraids to Captain Rotgrime. Problem is you need to be non-KoS
to be able to do this. If you can find a way around that you should be
ok.
