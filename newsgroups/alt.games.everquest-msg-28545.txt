Best group Ive ever been in was made up of 2 Necros, 2 Warriors, a Paladin
and me, fighting outside the north wall of KC in The dreadlands. Our puller
just had to bring the mob to the group, let our 4 tanks take over and run
off to find another mob, the first one being dead before he had even
returned. Talk about fast xp in a hell level!!

All I had to do was throw in the occasional group heal, to keep their HP
full.
