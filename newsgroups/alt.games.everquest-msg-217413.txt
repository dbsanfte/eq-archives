Prima guides are usually misclassified as game guides rather than
as humour...

I have seen them release useful and informative guides before.
The Bioware game guides are usually OK. Otherwise they have all
the depth of a mud puddle in a drought and all the insight of
Eliza. (*)

Allow people to die, porting them instantly to their bind point?

Of course, a *good* cleric will have the MT at or near full HP when
the MOB drops and not leave the party waiting for that heal to hit.
That's the only occasion I can thing of aside from my more facetious
suggestion. :-)

Possibly they meant the use of rez to get people back *in* to the
dungeon but we probably all know by now that you rez *after* the
objective is reached. Only exceptions being in some cases pure
melee (warriors, rogues, monks) and a one-off Divine Rez if your
lucky cleric hasn't used it that day.
