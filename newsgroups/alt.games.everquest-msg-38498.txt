dont want to pvp in DAoC? then dont.
there is a big wall with a gate thru it out to the frontiers(pvp
area)...dont go thru the gate.
you can level to 50, grouped or solo with any class and never once enter the
frontier world or see a
player from another relm
hate pvp myself...but in DAoC it's different...the grief killers seem to be
having problems.
a few of them gang up to go cause problems only to find themselves facing 15
to 50 enemies.
the pvp is very much large group tactical warfare in nature. it's actually
fun
