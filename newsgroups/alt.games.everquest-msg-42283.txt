Some guilds/clans/squadrons/teams in other games are formed around people
from a specific geographic locale.  I was part of one such Squadron in the
game Fighter Ace.

The advantage of such a geographically-based team in competitive online
games, is that you can get to know each other offline, and thus have better
communications when it counts.  For example, with my Fighter Ace squadron,
it really helped our combat efforts that everyone in the Squadron knew each
other IRL.  We wouldn't accept anyone whom we couldn't meet personally.  We
kept small, and it helped us keep things easy and orderly.

HOWEVER.... EQ is a different critter, even when PvP is taken into account.
IMHO, in-game communications in EQ is much better than in other games I've
seen, and being a purely geographically-based guild is unnecessary, and very
rare.

Unless you're communicating with local EQ players ahead of time, most people
in your immediate geographic area will likely be on other servers, and
impossible to find.  The major reason for being in a geographically-based
guild in EQ is if your language or dialect is significantly different than
everyone else in the game (i.e., the mostly European and Japanese guilds.)

BTW, the internet shorthand is common in competitive, fast paced, PvP style
games.  It tells me Mr. Me is probably more familiar with other competitive
online games than he is with the PvE version of EQ.
