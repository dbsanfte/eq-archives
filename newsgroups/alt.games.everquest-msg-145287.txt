Two points though...  1) Unless you're in a raiding guild, or at least one
that can race to luclin mobs, the cheapest you're likely to get that spell
to put it in your spellbook is 20 - 30 k plat.  2) KEI costs 900 mana to
cast.  Even wearing it yourself, thats not trivial medtime, I don't think.
And if someone is paying for the spell, it's quite unlikely they're going to
be willing to sit around and wait while you round up 5 other people.  (even
assuming they dont' have a group they're asking for.)
