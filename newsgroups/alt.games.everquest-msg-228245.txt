Well, RL has some pretty severe restrictions on PvP that seem to work
reasonably well.  I suppose if you had to register your one and only
game instance in person, with a solid physical ID (finger+foot+retinal
prints maybe) it'd be possible to establish sanctions for misbehavior
(be it player vs. game company or player vs. player misbehavior) that
couldn't be trivially sidestepped by just running down to the local
game store and getting a new one.  Until then I expect your observation
will remain current.
