My lvl 24 chanter is unable to get a combine for any spell. I have
been very successful in the past in making the lvl 16 and 20 spells,
but am currently unable to do even those, much less the lvl 24 spells.

Is there a file or patch that I may have missed that is required for
me to be successful in performing the research?

Thanks a million for any suggestions or hints that may correct my
problem,
Ruetide
