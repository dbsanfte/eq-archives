As I said, I was attacked, I became defensive. One usually leads to
the other.

Yeah but your opinion is to shoot first ask questions later.

Yep, learned some of you meant well and some of you are just assholes.

What detractors? People that don't like EQ? What do you care what they
think? If they don't know a good game when they've played it yet feel
the need to harass people that do like the game, all you can really do
is feel sorry for them as they must have seriously miserable lives.

And victory? How so? So what if they think EQ is hackable? So what if
they think that EQ is a cheater heaven? They obviously have no clue at
all what a good game it is and hence should be promptly dumped into a
kill filter or just toyed with like the mindless creatures they are.

Well as I've said too many times now, it was a combination of both
that I found disturbing.

>We saw three possibilities: you were an idiot, you were a troll, or
>you were a newbie. You clarified yourself into a newbie later.

And since I didn't start with, Hey, I'm totally new, is EQ hacked, I
get jumped. No wonder newbies don't hang around long.

>A better way to put it is "Why is EQ down?"

And a better way to have responded to me would have been to have asked
me to clarify what had happened and what I meant.
