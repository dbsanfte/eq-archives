Ah, but you're talking about the whole TSS expansion.  Yeah, I'll
probably buy it at some point.  I still have lots to do in the old
content, but I admit finding sensible quests/tasks (unlike those
given by taskmasters in the older zones) would be a plus.  But for
now, I was just talking about the Crescent Reach zone itself, i.e.
the zone that I have access to only because my home city is messed
up (at least until I cave and buy the expansion).
