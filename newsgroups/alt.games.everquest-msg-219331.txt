Are you sure about the 30 minutes after success? Not that I've ever
checked it, I always assumed you had the full 90 minutes plus your 30
minute grace period. It can actually be a pretty important
distinction, I've heard of a major bug if you happen to get a rez
right as the dungeon poofs (your corpse can appear naked outside) so
knowing about how much time you have is useful.

I am biased in the sense that I haven't done anything lower than a 51
pt mission, I can't speak to their relative difficulty.  I will say
that the groups I usually take into LDoN are far from high end. Unless
it's a weekend morning when my more uber friends aren't off raiding,
I'm usually the one with the most AAs. Groups average about 30AAs and
often one or two people that aren't 65. Strangely enough, adding one
or two elemental geared players doesn't speed things up appreciably.

Yeah, that does make a huge difference. I don't think I've ever had
more than 2 people I don't know in an LDoN group and I always make
sure there's a puller that knows how to agro pull and a good druid or
cleric to cover main heals.  If I can't get that as the basis for a
group, I don't bother with LDoN. One nice thing about LDoN is that a
lot of other high end zones aren't nearly as crowded.

Heh, I would've thought that most of the druman would know better by
that level. I do group with other shaman but they're always people I
know and trust. There's never any need for me to add a random, unknown
shaman to a group I'm in.

One of the things I like about LDoN is that (unlike Tier 2+ PoP) it
gives me an excuse to offtank. Even with a pair of plate tanks, I'll
offtank the first add so the rest of the group can concentrate on
killing something quick.

That, of course, is always the best reason to add any class to a
group.
