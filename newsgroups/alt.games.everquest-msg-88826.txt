  I personally believe it does.  I don't have any hard evidence to
prove it, but different people have different opinions.  Though in my
experience, the Warrens is a sensibly designed and balanced dungeon...
and it only makes sense that killing the king of the kobolds would
improve your standing with the kobold's enemies moreso than killing a
scrawny, insigificant runt.
