If he wasn't convinced, why did he agree to it?

I agree that bards make much better pullers.  Some of the very best.  But
telling the group that you are not going to pull anything, then going out
and pulling anyways is a dumbass thing to do, no matter what class you are
or what class the puller is.

The idea of having a bard pull is to get as few mobs as possible to camp at
the same time... but by lying to the group, this idiot deliberately caused
adds and multiple pulls, since even if the warrior only pulled one, the bard
went and pulled a few more.
