Current system: mob X pops once a week.  If only one guild wants it, they
get it 52 times a year.

Proposed system: mob X pops every, say, 3 hours, but you have to wait a week
before you can kill it after your last kill.  If only one guild wants it,
they get it 52 times a year, just like under the current system.  So what if
the mob sits untouched for 165 hours between spawning on the banishment
timer on that guild running out?  It is still there for them when their week
is up, so they still get all their kills.

Current system: if two guilds want it, they only get it 26 times a year
(ideally...or in reality, one guild gets it most of the time and the other
rarely gets it).

Proposed system: they both get it 52 times a year.
