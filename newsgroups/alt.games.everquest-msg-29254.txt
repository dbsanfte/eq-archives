Yes this happens after someone does the Kromrif leggings quest, She attaches
herself to, normally, an NPC. I have not seen her with a PC before, could
you control her at all? Did she defend you in a fight?
Make nice exp hunting giants with her as a pet :ï¿½)

Last time I saw this happen she followed a Feral Cave Kodiak like a lost
puppy, needless to say I did not pull that particular kodiak.
