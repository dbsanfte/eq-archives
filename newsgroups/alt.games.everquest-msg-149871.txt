 I agree. I don't want the cleric relying on my mend to keep me alive.
The cleric/healers shouldn't care if I have mend. If I'm low on HPs and
you have mana, heal me. If not I'll hit mend before I die if I have it.

 SK is handy to have on some of the Luclin encounters. Until Verant
nerfed their aggro spells.

 Yes. Not steering the mobs. If you're MTing and you have aggro and are
getting a large push from one  side, switch sides. Easy concept in
theory.

 lol. I'm beginning tothink trees are large mob magnets on things like a
PoG clearing. I don't see how they fail to see that mob being pushed
right towards a tree.

 Semi-related to that is /assist. Don't jump on mobs before assist is
called. Then again you mention that further down. But I had already
typed that before I read it so it stays!
