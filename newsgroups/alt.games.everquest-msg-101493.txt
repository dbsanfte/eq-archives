Anal ;)

As a chanter I will often use every abbreviation under the sun If I'm busy
(which is a lot) or running and typing on the fly.

Plz, spare a thought for those of us who play a busy class and dont have our
secretarial speed typing qualification.

Of course, if I'm not busy I will attempt to make the effort!  Still prolly
(that's a nice abbreviations isn't it?) be littered with typing mistakes
(man I hate ppl who use typo)

cheers
