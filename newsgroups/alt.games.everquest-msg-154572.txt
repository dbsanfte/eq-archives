Hmm, yep... the scary post is inaccessible to me as well.  But hey... just 
how uncommon a name is 'Ron A Green' anyway?  Got any evidence that the 
post you accuse him of was actually from the same IP?  Got any evidence 
that you didn't start a netcom account in his name just to try and frame 
him?  Got any evidence that the post in question was actually 
pro-pedophilia and not a flame of whoever posted the original file?  I 
note with amusement that you aren't willing to put your name on your 
accusation... How much weight do you think accusations from 'Anonymous 
Poster' carry, anyway?

Inquiring minds couldn't give a shit less, really.  He's our bizbee and 
you can't have him.  Well, unless you have some sort of evidence.
