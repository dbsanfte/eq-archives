Necro only need 2 spells if we taking about rouge with uber resists.


deflux to heal you fast  and splurt that will do 1100dmg if not rooted or
feared.

splurt is hard to resist and then make sure you have dmf up to keep away
from the rouge.

just run after splurt landed and reapply until rouge is dead.

you can solo any warrior class with uber items with splurt and deflux.

Make sure rouge dont have sow first hrhrhrh
