	I suppose that would've eventually been me, wiping on half the named 
until the right stuff dropped, if my old guild had stuck together. In 
retrospect, I almost feel lucky they didn't.

	You mean you might as well raid and spend less time getting better 
upgrades :P

	If we're talking 65's here, abysmal sea and most of Natimbi are greened 
out. Tipt & Vxed were (believe me - or don't if you like) out of the 
question for non-raider groups who weren't charm-cheating. The 4 sewers 
zones, as far as I'm concerned, are the same zone :P

	(although you could almost say that most GoD zones seemed identical to 
at least one other GoD zone. What boring expansion!)

	So my exageration aside: yes slightly more than three zones, but the 
overwhelming majority of the expansion's content locked to people either 
not raiding or in raid gear, and although some excellent upgrades were 
available to the charm-cheaters in VXed and Tipt, they weren't 
sufficient to bridge the gap and allow progression.

	Now you're going to tell me GoD doesn't matter, everyone knows it was a 
mistake :P

> KT, Ikkinz, Yxxta all available to single groupers.

	Who had a lot of raid gear on. A tiny portion of LDoN geared single 
groupers could get to KT by charm cheating Vxed & Tipt (and some of us 
did), but Ikkinz & Yxxta... hahahaha yeah.

	Thankfully, they don't seem to have over-fixed it - I'm not being 
pipped out of groups by monks as I was in my 30's and 40's before the nerf.

	Oh I'm sure the same people will put up with 6 wipes in a row on raid 
content, but put them in a group with lesser geared people, on content 
they expect to do safely, and one wipe will have them packing their bags.

	Had an example of this just the other day - excellent cleric from an 
uberguild joined us for a (you guessed it!) creator or two. Wonderful 
cleric, fast reactions, more HP and AC than me (as she helpfully pointed 
out after I died while she was meleeing an add). Anyhow, to cut a long 
story  of uberguild arrogance short (I eventually sent her a polite tell 
explaining that I and others with her had indeed done these before!), we 
had one gater mob gate, and come back with a train that wiped us. Well, 
most of us, I feigned at 4%. (my kingdom for an 0% SK rez). She left 
immediately afterwards, claiming her guild was about to raid GoD.

	Which, based on a /who 15 minutes later, I believe was a bit of a fib.

	And this is the issue. That raider cleric chick had less than half the 
reason I did to stick with that mission and make it work. The DoN augs 
might be a nice addition to her already-adequate gear, wheras the actual 
plate pieces are my primary source of badly-needed upgrades right now.

	Well, the vendor stuff is behind Elemental, and nowhere near time gear. 
What are you talking about?
