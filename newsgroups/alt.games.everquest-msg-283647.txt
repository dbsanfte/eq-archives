Agree with Don (I think it was Don who replied?).  What's the point
when you can just feign?  Hide would be nice for a Cleric, Paladin,
Warrior, etc,.. but a Necro?

Well, the nice thing about being an Inky is that your home town is more
central.  Before PoK and the bazaar, the commonlands and the areas near
them were much more popular hunting grounds and I would bet that this
will be true again on the progression server.  You are also non-KOS in
Freeport, I think, just like Erudite necros, though I can't be certain.
 Also you can buy Fuligan Soulstones quite easily.  Still, I think the
advantages for the Erudite outweigh those for the DE.

The Erudite can buy a Hole key with no faction work.  The Erudite,
other than in Neriak and the OT outpost, is slightly more welcome
everywhere.  Your faction isn't great but it is generally non-KOS and
not as negative as for DEs.  Also, I think the Erudite gets a bigger
int. boost than the Inky.  Finally, since I believe this will include
PoK right from the start, and even if it didn't, you are a caster with
Bind Affinity, home city doesn't matter much.  You should still be able
to bank in Neriak (and probably Freeport) and there are merchants in
the commonlands and LS.  You can "live" wherever you please if there is
no POK.

Lavastorm might be fairly popular if they keep the new gear drops
there.  The stuff that drops off named mobs there is pretty weak by
today's standards (+10 HP!!!) but against 1999 standards it is pretty
good, plus it sells for 50-100 plat to merchants.  That will be a lot
of money on the new server.
