In my high-30s I, as a rogue, took to the occasional soloing of Ruathey in
Lavastorm.  She was perfect - factionless, and near a zoneline.  We took
turns.  She whooped my butt, I whooped hers.  After a while, the tables
started to tilt in my favour.  I saw her last night - low blue at 48th and
barely lost a bubble to her.
Quite the change from a Velious green who can send me fleeing without losing
a second bubble of health to me.
