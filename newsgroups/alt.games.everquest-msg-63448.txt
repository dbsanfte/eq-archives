IMO, first four, sure.  Fifth...it's REALLY borderline.  With tailoring the
way it is (excessively slow & dull) I'm not yet sure if the 5th is a total
waste of time for a simple +1 added benefit to the 4th shawl.  And the 6th
requires even MORE tailoring skill.  I've also found that getting from skill
20 to 105 is more painful (fewer skill gains) than any other trade skill
I've mastered (brewing, baking, pottery, jewelcraft and of course
tailoring).

Why are the first four worth doing?  Because all those trade skills are
CHEAP (less than 50p) and FAST to learn.  But the only trade skill that's of
any use after you get the 4th shawl is cooking...those fish rolls (fish +
batwings = banquet-sized meal) come in damned handy if you're not a foraging
race/class.  That's it.  No marketability for pottery or baking.  Tailoring
is more expensive to train even if someone gave you all the loot-only
components you'll need (not freakin' likely) to get up to 150 skill.

So, checking out the CPS quest I'm thinking that no, it's not worth it.  I
may still DO it, since I'm at 105 in tailoring anyway, but only when I've
got NOTHING else to do (including reading a book).
