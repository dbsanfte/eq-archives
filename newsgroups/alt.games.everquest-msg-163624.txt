Actually, I'm moving my computer downstairs, and while the parents are
away, I'd like to have the game running up here with my other account
selling, whilst I'm playing my account downstairs.  As they only have
a 3 gig hard drive in their computer, they would probably appreciate
that I keep both instances on my computer :) Thus, I'm attempting to
install twice.

Using your solution (the "um, duh?" solution - thanks ><), I can get
both to start up, but now the second installation's patcher is
refusing to move past the last blue bubble of the first yellow of the
patch, and hitting "cancel" sets it in "please wait for initialization
to complete"... and stays there, so I can't even do a complete file
check.  -_-  I don't think EQ likes me today.
