/me refrains from making a "Isn't there one like that already called

I'm currently in EQ and Ultima Online, but just ordered myself a copy of 
City of Heroes, which looks like my kind of fun :-) UO, after a good 
start, hasn't quite peaked my interest in quite the same way...which is 
a shame as I really enjoyed the initial exploration into the game world 
(and said so, something else which is a shame ;-)). On looking deeper, 
however, I found that it lacked the depth and detail that I enjoy in EQ.

Have been with EQ for a couple of years now though, really helps me to 
develop my writing skills in forming the history behind my main 
character, not to mention I find it immersive and enjoyable most of the 
time (though have had to explore a little to try and escape the 
continual loop of 'camp...kill...gain exp...repeat' gameplay but 
thankfully I avoid that now I have more experience with Norrath :-))

Each character having their own living space, and the graphics have 
peaked my interest in EQ2, however, so let me know what you think of it 
:-) I was going to grab EQ2 when it came out but after some of what I've 
heard about the 'hand-holding' nature of the gameplay, I'm going to wait 
a while to see how people react to it (bit short on cash).
