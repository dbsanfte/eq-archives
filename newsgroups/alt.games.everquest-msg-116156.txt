I cut out the rest, but Newshound said that MS used its dominance in the OS
market to gain a monopoly in the market for Word Processing, among others.
My response to him was meant primarily to refute that claim, on the basis
that MS gained market share on the strength of the product, and not by
leveraging its ownership of the OS.  Thus, dated though the example is, it
is valid nonetheless (at least from the point of view of one consumer -- me)
in demonstrating that MS dominates the Word Processing market because it
fielded a superior product to its contemporaries.

I was not swayed to MS Word because of advertisements.  I never saw any back
then.  I was swayed because, while Word Perfect was then a better known
product, MS Word was far superior.  You ask if I have looked at Word Perfect
lately, so I must assume that a relatively new version exists, and that, in
further support of my point, you agree Microsoft does not have a monopoly on
the word processing market.  In fact, although it has a massive share of
that market, it has not, all boogeyman talk to the contrary, bought out nor
destroyed every member of the competition in that field.

Now, if these other word processors have truly caught up with and even
surpassed MS Word in quality, it can be argued that MS Word does not retain
dominance because of Microsoft's ownership of the OS, but rather, that MS
Word has the advantage of now being the "one to beat," and enjoying the
advantages in competition that all incumbents do, and that none of those
other products has distinguished itself enough to make the consumer at large
want to switch.

As for crashing, I can't say why you've had a bad time of it with 2000.  It
could be Windows itself, or it could be the drivers.  And for anyone about
to jump in here and remind me of "Linux the invincible", I crashed that pile
of shit OS the same way many people crash windows -- I trusted the driver I
downloaded for my graphics card to be written correctly when it wasn't.
Granted, the core Linux didn't need a graphics card driver, being command
prompt driven.  But when I put the driver in to make the GUI I was using fit
onto less than about 100 square feet of virtual screen, the whole goddamned
thing crashed.  GUI, Linux, and all.

I wanted to address all your points here, but it is very late now.  Almost
4:00 a.m.  I'm going to sleep.
