But the video card is a greater factor than the CPU for the vast 
majority of game titles. I run a PIII800 with a GF1 as my 2ndary and it 
runs EQ very acceptably. Before putting the gf1 in it, I had an older 
32M ATI Rage Pro and it was 1 frame per 3 seconds even in freeport, and 
totally unplayable. I'd be willing to bet dropping a GF4 into the 2ndary 
would bring it almost to par, and would be a far better upgrade choice 
than a new mobo/cpu/ram. (And I'll try it when the next gen of video 
cards come out... I'm running a gf4ti4600 in my main, and don't see a 
lot of value in either the latest gf or ati card for the price... so 
I'll skip upgrading until the next generation.

(Plus I recall way back my overclocked Celeron 300A to 450MHz was 
outperforming top of the line PII-450s handily due to the cache speed 
differential, which kyboshes your 'at the same clock speed' assertion... 
to an extent. Overclocking isn't exactly "fair"...but neither was 
charging $500+ for a cpu when an easily overclocked (move one pin on the 
mobo) $100 one was rock stable and faster)
