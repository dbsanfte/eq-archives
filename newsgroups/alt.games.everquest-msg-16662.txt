Sucky.

I suppose transferring the logs to a Linux box and wriing a small Perl 
script to parse them and give you score sheets would be a trivial 
endeavor... The sheets could list your skills and things like "You have 
killed x skeletons, y bats, and z rats". If I write a log parser, would 
anyone here want a copy? I might just do it (next time Drinal is down ;).

~Empty, who has been wondering this same thing
