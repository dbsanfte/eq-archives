Aye, and then spent most of the last 5-10 years trying to convince the 
world that it didn't -need- a command line, and that it should be hidden 
as far away as possible, so no one would accidentally use the simple 
solution.

At least they haven't taken it away completely.  Yet.  But I see plenty of 
evidence that they'd really appreciate it if we didnt go try to use it or 
anything.

Sigh.  I want my DOS back.  At least it pretended to be an operating 
system, instead of pretending to be a 'user interface'.
