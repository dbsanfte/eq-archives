Hmm that is a good idea. I'd see paying a nominal fee to get my char
updated on the web server maybe while still staying on my own.. as a
vanity thing, after all you never have to alter it yourself but its
updated once a day. The web map "where you've been" thing is kind of
cool also. A completed quests area would be nice too.. especially if
it showed you having completed already existing no drop item quests
(like my epic)

I believe the "character portrait" is just your 3d luclin model with
whatever it is wearing at the legends site. Thats kind of good enough
for me. Maybe what they could do is give us a choice of background
area.
