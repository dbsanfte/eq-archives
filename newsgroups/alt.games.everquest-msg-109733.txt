Actually, it seems like there is -one- main healer class, two utility priest
classes, and two melee classes who can heal.  You assert that fifeen classes
require three healer classes, maybe Verant disagrees.

Their utility on raids is balanced out by their extreme soloability.  I know
you don't think they are soloable, but I've seen different, and any attempt
to tell me I didn't see what I saw will only help to further lower your
crediblity.

> Druids should get cheal to help rebalance clerics as not so dominant.

Sure, remove the ability to quad kite, and I'll agree.  If Druids get
complete heal, then Clerics are useless during the raid.  Just camp one for
a TPW, and you're golden.  Gee, I hope someone remembers to tell him when
the raid's done, so he doesn't have to try to pick his way out alone.

Amusing story, but it has no relevence to the current thread.

It needs to be fixed alright, the rest of us need to become as powerful as
druids.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
