>Now, what the heck are a bunch of L50s doing slumming in Stormhold?

I think they must of added some high end content. I was in there last
night and someone ran past me dragging a lvl 44 heroic mob! I nearly
had a heart attatck.

Not nearly a big a heart attack as I had in Thnundering Stepps when I
ideal decided to look behind me and saw a lvl 35 raid X2 mob slowly
homing in on me!!!
