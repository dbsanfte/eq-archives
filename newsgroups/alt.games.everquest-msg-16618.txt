Ok,

So I'm on Test last night, and they announce that if you go create a new 
character on the PVP Test server right then, they make you an instant Level 
25.  "Nifty", think my friends and I, so off we go.  I don't think any of 
us had done PVP before, so we were completely clueless as to tactics.  

My question is this:  How do I target the little bastid PKing 
gnomes/dwarves that kept darting in among our group?  I couldn't use the F-
whatever key because my fellow groupmates would get targetted.  I tried 
mapping the move keys to the E, C, S, F keys so I could keep my right hand 
on the mouse, but my left hand is retarded and couldn't get the hang of it.  
(and to think I'm left-handed!)

Hit-and-run artists they were, and we had only starting weapons and spells 
with which to defend ourselves.  We could never save any money to buy 
anything because they'd do a drive-by ganking and run off with our hard 
earned cash.

Aimee
