Oh, I *know* what you mean, but it hasn't stopped my calendar-buying (and
he's December of this year, but I don't care, I know what the damn date is
anyway!), picture book of the movie, desktop wallpaper, seeing the movie 6
times so far binge :) I don't care that he's young enough to be my son, I
jes like lookin' at him! ;) I actually bought the movie theatre poster so I
could look at him to my heart's content. I've never in my life done
something like that. I'm a scientist -- geology -- (which some people say
*isn't* a science, but don't get me started on *that*), an artist and a
writer.... hmm... wonder where these things are coming from? Maybe my second
childhood! Oh please, not NSync!


Flame away, guys ;)
