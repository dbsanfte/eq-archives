Yeah, I went there and it looks like something I want to try, but I 
wasn't able to create a station.com account. Step 1 was entering my 
name, password, etc., but there wasn't any type of "submit" or 
"continue" button to proceed!

I wish I had a better understanding of their difference. I will try the 
free EQ1 server and see if I like it. That's an ideal place to start (if 
I can get it to work), but is there something like it for EQ2? I can't 
imagine they are so different. Aren't they both basically "build a 
character and explore and do quests" etc.?
