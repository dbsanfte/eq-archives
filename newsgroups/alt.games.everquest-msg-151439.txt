Yes. Once again, the 75 stat thing only affects agil in such a
pronounced way. People have not noticed anything similar 
on other stats. Your cleric gained 30 ac going from agil 73 to 75,
meanwhile my wood elf noticed in magelo that if I'd added TWENTY
POINTS to my base agil of 90 i would not have gained ONE ac (even at
level 60) Meanwhile her base sta is around 70 or 74, adding 20 points
to that would only give her 30 more hp at level 60. You don't notice a
large reward or large penalty with the other stats, especially on the
low end. Stamina starts to really add hp when you are up around 150 -
200 though.

I kind of think of stamina for a melee type like wis or int for caster
types. Its not so much that its going to make a HUGE difference, its
more like NO OTHER stat has ANY difference on how strong the character
is beyond agil being at least 75. So you may as well slam points where
they will at least do something, however small a difference it will
really make. 

The agil problem even existed in the beta. I remember making the
ogre sk and not adding to agil at all. We had no idea there was a
minimum then, all I knew was that by level 10 my ogre sk could not
tank ANYTHING. I remade as an ogre warrior, having 75 or above agil at
base, and soon was level 10 and tanking great in the same gear. At the
time my shaman buddy and I just thought that warriors were much better
tanks at that level, never guessing it was the agil.
