With a well equipped warrior that knows how to play one, it's not 
generally an issue.  With certain other types of warriors on the other 
hand...

In a pickup group, I will always choose a knight over a warrior, because 
a mediocre knight is far better at aggro control than a mediocre warrior.  
If it's a warrior I know and trust, I'd be quite happy with him.
