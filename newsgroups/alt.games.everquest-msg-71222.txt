To be honest, I want the thing... but no, I'm not crippled without it.  I did
all the parts I can without guild help, and there are several guild clerics
ahead of me on the next couple parts... all to get me on a list that is,
as of yesterday, 44 deep for a mob that spawns 3 times a week at
best if they stop patching (hasn't spawned once since SOL release,
since its minimum 3 days after patch)

The item is really quite nice on its own, and the difference in mana cost
between free and 900 a pop certainly adds up if you are resing a raid
gone bad.

Lets see, getting epic without guild.  Get the list of names.  Contact
everyone on it and offer to buy MQ.  There's doubtless at least one
guy on that list that has decided to quit EQ and move to DAOC or
something... a few hundred US Dollars might do the trick.. or it
might not.
