Certain items seem to be selling, although I'm just using straight /auction at
the moment.

Did they leave in the requirement that you have to be logged in and in your
house to sell your goods?  Or did that get cut out.   Cause that was
thedealbreaker for me.  I will not buy a second account just to leave a vendor
up.   And I don't have a second computer to run it even if I was that crazy.
Couldn't stand it for EQ's bazaar system either.
