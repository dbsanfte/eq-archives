I petitioned a problem with a recommended level a few weeks ago
(Rotting Gorilla Hide Sleeves, recc. 51, my druid was then 43) and got
the following response:

'It has been requested that the "recommended" flag be altered to show
as "required" instead for those items requiring a specific level be
attained before they can be equipped.  This change must be done at the
Development level, thus I can not guarantee this will be changed nor
give any specification as to when it might be done either.'

Knowing that some items can indeed be equipped at a lower level, and
that as far as I'm aware all such items show stats for lower levels,
I'd say it's a bug.
