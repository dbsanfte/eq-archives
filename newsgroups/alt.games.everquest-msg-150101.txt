It is amazing.  For an even more entertaining use of the same
technique, check out http://www.filmwise.com/invisibles/index.shtml

Every week they put up a new batch of images, which are scenes
from movies -- except the actors have been removed, leaving
their empty clothing(!) and the background intact.  The trick
is to figure out what movie/scene it is.  It's surprisingly
hard without the actor's faces.
