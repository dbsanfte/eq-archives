Im not sure how your con is for the good gypsies. If youre dubious or above
it wont hurt to try at the good gypsies. Id be surprised if the evil gypsies
didnt like you tho. They are in southern desert of ro, pretty much due south
of the zonein from oasis. Look for some tents. Not sure which one is the
lighstone quester, but hailing them should tell.
