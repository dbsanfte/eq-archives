Judges have a lot of latitude in interpreting the fairness of wills.
When WQ and I were having our wills done, our lawyer made it clear
that 'unusual' terms in a will are frequently thrown out in court. The
interpretation of 'unusual' is also pretty broad. 

You might try a newsgroup on law. What sort of valid answers do you
expect to get on a buffy-the-vampire newsgroup or from Kiss fans,
anyway?
