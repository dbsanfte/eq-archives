This is correct (with a few exceptions, 39 charm for example)

However, most songs work for 3 tics in a row if you stop them, so even a
relatively untalented bard can keep at least 3 running at a time.  Running only
1 cuts your song output to a third (or a quarter or even to a 5th) what it
could be.

This would be similar to having a cleric insistantly click off KEI, or a
warrior insisting on using a Rusty Warhammer as his only weapon.
