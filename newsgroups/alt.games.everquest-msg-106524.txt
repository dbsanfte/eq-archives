Hmm on the resists issue... My druid is a young 24 and it seem shis
creeeping crud spell is continualy resisted... now mind you im doing
this on the Avics in SK... and havent had the chance to thry on other
beasts.. Are the avics in particualr resistant to it... my stinging
swarm sticks very well on them.  Or is it mor that its a new spell for
my druid and hes just not that good at it?

Thanks
