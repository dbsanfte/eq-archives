IMO, they were incredible up to a point.  And yes, that would be book 6,
(again, IMO).

In answer to your question on closure around book 6, no I don't think so.
Many, many things are left open at that point.

The first few novels he wrote are self contained...  you could actually read
the first book, _The Eye of the World_ as a stand-alone novel.  It would
only be good instead of excellent, but it wraps up pretty well.  The first
three books, up to _The Dragon Reborn_, you could read as a stand-alone
trilogy.  After that, Jordan stopped bothering to tie up most of the loose
ends by the end of the specific novel.

And while you could read just the first three... you would then miss out on
book 4, _The Shadow Rising_, which I think was the best of the series.
