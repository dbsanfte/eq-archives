Maybe that was more the issue then, Brad trusting his dev team and not
seeing for himself?  At that point I don't think he was coding too
much anymore and tied up more in the business aspect of the company.

Won't find me in that category.  I think EQ was the best computer game
ever made, and second only to D&D overall.  Of course that's just me
but I've loved this game since it came out.  Issues and problems?  Of
course.  But everything does, it's all a matter of taste and
acceptance.

Some of this, or all of it, could have happened if they stayed as
well.  Who knows the plans that they had in the works when they lost
control?  I guess I should say gave up control, not lost.

My only point would be that the vision he and crew had was awesome.
No one at the time was even close.  Anyone ever seen the first game
Brad and core did?  It's circa 1991 done by a 2 man team (Brad and
Milo) with Steve porting it to PC.  Warwizard was the game and it
rocked for playability, at the time of course.  That was always the
goal, playability.  Other games looked better by far but none offered
the same feel and excitement.  Fast forward a few years and a huge
budget later and there's EQ.  Damn fine work and yet to be bested in
my opinion.
