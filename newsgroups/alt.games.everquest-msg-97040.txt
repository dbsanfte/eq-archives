Because Verant told us why about a month ago, said something about
gnomes being "specialists" so they'd never have a hybrid class. Irony
;)

Above.

Same.

If you try them on test though they have about the worst sk stats,
only an erud is really worse as far as stats (and blind) They'd be a
hilarious SK though in the same way as they are hilarious warriors,
but more so.

What I'm looking for now would be the race who would be about the
coolest rogue, the troll ;) If you've ever made a Troll warrior, you
see that already they can have stats which are quite rogue like which
would be great coupled with their large str and sta (and racial regen)
The new troll models even look more stealthy.
