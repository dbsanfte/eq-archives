Ok, what's the deal with top posting in a.g.e. all of a sudden? I haven't
visited in a couple months, and it seems it has become a crime in my
absence. I know that anal newsgroupies hate top posters because they might
want to read a reply to some ancient post that has popped up again, but I
prefer to follow a thread without having to scroll down every post to read
the reply.

(sets himself up for a severe beating) Why does that make me some kind of
idiot?
