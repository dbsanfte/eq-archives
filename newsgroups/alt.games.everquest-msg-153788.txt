Your forgeting the fact that MB is based on a wizards mana.  If they are
nuking through the fight as normal and it all goes wrong, they won't have
the full mana needed for a "Burn and kill it NOW".. with mod rod they could
make mana fast, with the mod rod nerf too?   Forget it, MB is a ruined
ability.
