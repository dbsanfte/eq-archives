Ahh, you're right! In retrospect, I can't say for sure that any of the
spells did land while she was in the water. She was trying to climb out in
real time and may have already been out of the water by that time. It was
such a frantic moment with the clock ticking that it didn't even occur to me
that this wouldn't work in the first place (although I do know it) and as
soon as they both climbed out we ran our butts back into the dungeon. I
guess I didn't rescue her after all ... Don't tell her! ;-)
