Your system is wide open to a lot of apps especially on the net.  Software
has checked for enough disk space, existence of subdirectories, existence of
3d video card, etc since the first EQ. So why do you get excited about it
stating how much memory you have?  You agree to allow it to do what it has
to install the software, you do this implictedly when you choose to install
the program.  How do you think software knows how to interact with your
hardware if it doesn't inspect your system?  Really think about your
question.  If you don't want to interact go live in a cage. There are no
requirements that EVERYONE get you explicit permission to do things.
