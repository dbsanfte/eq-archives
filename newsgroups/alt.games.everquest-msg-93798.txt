Take the 50k and have it on your mouse cursor, then type "/petition I need
this money transferred to Ayonae ro."
Then click the money on destroy (don't worry, its already on Ayonae), click
yes.
Then log on your characer on Ayonae and type "/petition I can pick up my
money now."
About 15 minutes to an hour later a gm or guide should appear and give you
your money. (depends how busy they are smacking down trainers in KC), Tadaa!
