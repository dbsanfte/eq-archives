As a high-level Paladin, I have four AC/HP buffs that can *really*
help a lowbie (or even higher-level folks), and another three
that can be very valuable (PR/DR/MR) depending on what the
person is going to be fighting.

Usually, though, as I'm passing by a lowbie or six out
hunting, I'll fling just a Daring buff on them (120 boost
to max HP plus some AC) and keep going.  It's a pretty nice
boost all by itself, and I can cast it mana-free from 
my Deepwater Helm -- doing all the buffs gives me a big
mana hit, especially when there are lots of folks to buff.

But whenever a recipient responds with anything more than
a token "thanks", or tries to pay me (I cancel donations
for unsolicited buffs), I buff the hell out of them with
everything I've got.
