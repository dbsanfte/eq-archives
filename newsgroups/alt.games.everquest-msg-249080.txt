Bad idea.

1) Collections/Slaughters are already easy... why let players not even 
leave the entrance? Players will also have no reason to crack the larger 
rooms with multiple pulls, enchanters, etc etc... just wait for the 
respawn and work back the other way.

2) Rescues become twice as much work as *anything* else. And assasinates 
  are bumped up in difficulty too.

The game needs to have some time pressure events. You want to do a 
dungeon crawl with respawn and no timer go to sola, lguk, kael...

I doubt it. The missions are good as is. The only problems with the 
missions are that there are two few, and the difficulty is not balanced.

Oh... and there could be more mission varieties, as well as 
quests/subquests, secondary objectives, random npc encounters...

Not sure how groups without a cleric are supposed to play this dungeon?
Not sure how the cleric gets back in if he wipes?
