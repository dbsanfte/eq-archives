It's like that on Tribunal too, but I still get some raised eyebrows from
the clerics when I hand 'em a gem I just looted. It's a good idea, and it
works. The clerics are happy, and I'm fine with it. Hell, I play a druid, I
never get a Symbol unless I'm pulling! (rare, but it happens .. Bodyguards
in Karnor's is one pull I love, but I hate the pathing bugs in that room ..
Gotta pull 'em in a specific order if you want one at a time. ;) .. The
Symbols go to the tanks, which are getting hit and dealing damage while at
the same time keeping the taunt off of me and the cleric and the enchanter,
so we can kill the mobs and get experience and loot. It's a perfectly fair
trade to me.

I've only once been grouped with a cleric that didn't Symbol, but that was
in the Overthere with my warrior alt. I can understand why he didn't, as the
usual loot off a mob there is in the silvers rather than plat.
