Yeah I like them a lot, but the performance hit is bad.

Yep, that bugs me too. It has severely fragmented the cosmetics of the
game X 3 (or would it be aesthetics?) You have people seeing a
different look with old models whether or not they have velious
textures turned on, then you have people seeing a FURTHER different
look whether or not they are using luclin models. That is THREE
possible different looks, which are really quite a bit different. I
might look really cool in the chain on my dark elf female but on the
old dark elf model look like some ghetto prostitute with the old chain
look.

To me Look is one of the most important things in a game like this,
its the point of getting cool stuff. I was playing AO again while
bored the other day (anarchy online) and one cool thing is if you are
running around with a panty and a halter top, everyone sees you
running around with a panty and a halter top exactly as you see
yourself. The same is true of any weapons/armor or outfits.

Nothing more has shown me that its time for EQ2 more than the fact
that EQ1 now needs 3 different cosmetic looks for players who might
have different systems (even outside of just different preferences) I
think that pretty much puts the nail in the coffin and tells you it is
time to move on. The legacy people hold the game back, the 3 year old
basic code holds the game back, the familiarity with every aspect of
the game and the downtime/camping hold the game back. Its time to let
go. 

EQ2 is not out for a year and a half still, I wish it was out
tomorrow. Its long overdue.
