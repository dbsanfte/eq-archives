rangers are on a different melee table . .. which is the technical way of
sony saying "BECAUSE I SAID SO" like an underequipped mother in a battle
with a teenager

apparantly, sony's notoriously brilliant balancing skills go something like
this: the order of the DPS classes, from worst to best, is the order of
tanking-ability from best to worst

so->
*tanking*
worst-------------------------------------best
rogue/ranger ... bst ... monk ... sk/pal ... war

and
*dps*
worst------------------------------------best
war....pal/sk.....bst....monk.....ranger/rogue


and there's lots of room for discussion (LOOK HOW GOOD I AM TO THIS NG !)
because 1) i forgot between rogues and rangers who is the worse tank ..i
suspect rogue, but i've seen full aa rogues tank anything short of tier3
PoP, but i haven't met enough high lvl rangers to say the same (sorry)

and 2) i hear some amazing stuff about beastlord tanking abilities, and
monks can be pretty crazy too, and so i think, despite whatever research
i've done, there will never be a cut n dry irrefutable way to position them
in a chart like the one i tried to make above...however i feel that monks
are surely better dps than bsts, though usually not by a longshot

wearing a flak jacket just in case i said something wrong, ( i do hope i've
helped)
