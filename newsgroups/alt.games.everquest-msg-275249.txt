yep: this has happened to me too.. the main tank in a group is a hard spot
to play; he/she/it should be aware of the situation and tell people to run,
when it's all going down hill. on the other hand magic users / healers
should inform the MT if they're running out of 'mana' (in case MT doesn't
notice..). I guess it all comes down to communicating. if communication is
lacking there's going to be problems..

this is also the reason why I'm propably considered a bad MT: I spend alot
of time asking my group mates' opinions about which mobs we can take and
which we should leave be (yes: i'm that much of a newbie, that I can't tell
half the time..).
