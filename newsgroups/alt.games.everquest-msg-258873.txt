Actually, yes, I do enjoy them quite a bit.  So far I am only flagged for 
the first 3 elemental planes, and one mini shy of Sol Ro chamber.  I have 
a blast on raids, but, that has a lot to do with being with friends.  
I've been in 3 guilds, one very small guild of friends, one family and 
minimal raids guild, and my current one, friendly, RL conscious raid 
oriented guild.  If I was not having fun, I would not still be playing.  
Sure, there are a couple or so people I don't get along with in the 
guild, but, with 100ish members, I can deal with having a very small 
percentage I don't care for.
