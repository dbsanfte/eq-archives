I wondered about that.  The bats left me alone... both times I went by them
invis vs undead.  I was level 31, and the bats were Blue To Me.  But I don't
remember how they regarded me.  (Probably indifferent, or I wouldn't have
walked through a room full of them... I was pretending I was a rogue, not
pretending I was an idiot).

Nothing agroed on me until the invis popped (the first time)...  The second
time, the invis only popped when I gated out, and by that time, it was far
too late for anything to get really upset.
