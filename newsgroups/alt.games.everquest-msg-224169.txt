Personally I only have a hotkey for Complete Heal.  Everything else
to me is just a bunch of spamming the group doesn't need.  But here's
what my CH key looks like (and its served me very well)

/gs A COMPLETE HEAL incoming %t, don't wander too far.
/pause 1,/stand
/pause 1,/cast 1
/pause 38,/cast 1
/gs Half way there, hold on (5 sec to go)

Now, due to lag, out of range, and a handful of other things the
5 seconds to go doesn't always work, but its pretty close 95 %
of the time.  I find that the "backup" healer's like that more than
the tanks and what not.

As to the wrong message, why not switch what Hotkey page
you are looking at when you switch spell sets?
