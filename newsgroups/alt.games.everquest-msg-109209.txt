Not remotely true.  Imagine an object of some sort, say a block of wood, 
that is green in color.  To a person with a certain colorblindness condion, 
the block appears red.  They *percieve* it to be red.  Is the block red?  
Does it make the slightest difference to the actual color of the block what 
color they perceive it to be?
