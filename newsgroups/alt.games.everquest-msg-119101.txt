I had no clue what I was doing when I created my ranger. I devided up the
points evenly, although more went to str. Now I have str coming out of my
ears, but he's badly wanting sta. I managed to bump it to 102. So, yes go
for sta first, and maybe put something towards other things, but mainly sta.

Oh well, botched it up, no big deal really. So, you're falling a little
behind in the combat duration curve. It's a magical roleplaying environment,
not rocket science is what I say.

Going to ding 39 in an hour or so BTW.
