OMG!   Do you realize the insanity of that?

Can you imagine playing for months...getting "Jedi" flagged only to
lose it, because it is "as hard to remain a Jedi as it is to become
one"?

It would be like doing your Epic in EQ, and then having it "poof"..

How hard can it be to play a Jedi? This is a computer game after all.
It can't require that much "training". If keeping Jedi status requires
a bunch of "busy work", then people will burn out and lose interest.
Not a very smart way of keeping people playing.

It will also certainly make sure that people stop playing SWG. It's a
game not a job. Whatever "busy work" it will require to keep Jedi
status can be documented. All an "ebayer" has to do is sell the
account with an owners manual.

So a non-Jedi has to spend a bunch of money on gear to have a small
chance at defeating a player that lucked out and got "Jedi": flagged.
Anyone else see a problem with that?..

1. Bounty_Hunter01 buys "pp" (or credits or whatever) on Ebay, and
gears up to near-"jedi" levels of power...trivializing the
"special-ness" of being a Jedi.

2. Everyone and their dog hates Jedi's, because they have to amass and
spend a small fortune just to be close to them in power.
