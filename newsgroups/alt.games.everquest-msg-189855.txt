Because you are often fighting reds when PLing, I
believe that a class that has good damageshields
is a requirement.  As a total newbie, the person
being PLed usually cannot hit a monster, so having
a bazillion HP, monster AC, etc. only prolongs
the battles.

As the PLee gets a little higher level, the DS is
still important, but HP and AC becomes more useful
as the mobs hit harder.

Admittedly, I don't know a ton about shammys, but
I do not believe they have DS do they?  Therefore,
I would vote for the druid as the best PL class
at least until the higher levels.
