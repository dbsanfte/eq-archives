heheh, when pvp was first implemented, if you got killed you were open game,
pvp or mob
first red player to your corpse got your cash and pick of all items, iirc
this incuded containers too
any other red players wander by could also loot one item

koramin, 11th dwarf paladin, got killed in blackburrow while bound in
freeport, got talked into going hunting before i met up with red cleric for
bind later that night
by the time i got back, half my armor was gone and my mino axe
on the other hand, i learned the freeport-highpass-qeynos run really well
that day, as it took 5 tries to get back there,  naked and solo   :)
