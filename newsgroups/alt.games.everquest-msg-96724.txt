*sigh*
That should be a fucking circus and a half. At least the progression
from 30 to 35 to 40 to 45 *SOMEWHAT* prepared you for the mack truck of
51. Imagine if they had to go to 54 as the first hell level.

I'm getting a migraine. Just remembering 54 still gives me a shooting
pain in my left arm.
