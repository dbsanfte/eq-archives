I don't disagree with that. What I have been saying is that most
people currently playing play almost exclusively online. The reason
being they've already played through the single player...

The sales figures pointed out in another post compared to the number
of people seen in online gaming services don't indicate one way or
another on that. A lot of people may have played through the single
player and never touched it again. Others may only play occasionally.
