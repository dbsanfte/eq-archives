Fear was my worst one too, unsurprisingly.  One time it took about
seven hours just to complete the initial break due to wipe after wipe,
even with some of the best players on the server.

The worst though, was a mostly pickup raid that wanted to do a west
wall break despite not very many people having done it before.  The
first wave of four groups all zoned in at once hoping they'd be able
to control all the adds, but they couldn't.  Our next wave went in
and half of them died right at the portal, leaving the rest of us
who made it to the wall too weak and we got massacred shortly thereafter.

A few more attempts were made to establish a foothold in the SW corner,
but none of them succeeded.  The rest of us just sat around arguing
and panicking for hours.  Eventually we had to call it due to lateness
and a lack of people and would restart the next day with some additional
help.  By this point one person had even been knocked down to level 45
and was busily xping off of Cyndreela.  :-)

By the time we regrouped the next day it had been about 18 hours since
we started and some people were getting nervous about their corpses,
since these were the days when you only had 24 hours online time before
the corpse poofed.  Unfortunately our first couple of attempts weren't
any better than the previous day and the tension was becoming unbearable
as the clock ticked down.  We weren't getting anywhere though and had to
put it off yet another day.

It started going badly the third day as well, but miracle of miracles,
the zone crashed and we were able to run in and recover corpses before
the respawns started.  Some people suspected 'divine intervention' but
it seemed like a legitimate zone crash rather than just a GM despawning
things (at the time, zone crashes would leave equipped corpses looking
naked).  It was close, though -- some people had less than an hour
left on their corpses.

None of us were particularly keen on doing Fear again anytime soon.  :-)
