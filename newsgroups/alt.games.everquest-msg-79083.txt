I created a necro when EQ was first released.  Without doing much research,
I created a human necro and gawd knows where I used the extra points to.
I've saved about 4k pp and would like to use that to raise my int.  Current
gear i have on is :
4 int earrings, 4 int rings, 7 int face, warlock crown(1 int I think), 2 int
bracer, 2 int leggin, 4 int belt, SMR(8int i tihnk), 3 int cloak, flayed
boots..

Everything but cloak, one bracer and crown are bought or camped..

Please let me know what I can buy to raise int with 4k or where to camp or
SOLO for a good int items...

Thanks in advance,
Nedor Deador / Eci
