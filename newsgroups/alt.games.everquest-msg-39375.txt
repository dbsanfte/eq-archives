true .. the question doesn't make sense standalone. I mean what are the
popular mainstream shields one should get in the various levels .. liek 1-20,
20-30, 30+ or whatever ranges. The huge lists on allakhazams just confuse me,
since quite often you can buy a lowbie item for 5000 pp because it's rare,
or buy a level 55+ thing from sebilis for just 1k, because it's popular. A
few sugegstions on what to get in the various levels was what I'd like to 
get :)
