"Hay-zoos" is simply the hispanic pronunciation of what we pronounce
as "Jee-zus", and, yes, those with that name are named after the
Christian Messiah. Yeah, there are really people named Moses, but
that's a bad name, too. THe name being instantly recognizable to every
player of the game as that of a religious figure makes it a bad name,
even if you're taking the name of someone who was named after that
figure.
