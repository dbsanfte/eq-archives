Why didn't they put the Warrens style looting rules in place there? All the
farmers probably complained they weren't able to ply their "trade" in the
Warrens and so they think it's a bad idea :ï¿½/
Or perhaps it's too hard to implement on a current zone and they can only do
it with a completely new zone.
Oh well, What are the level range is Befallen? My Bard is in EC and is
22..maybe I'll see about getting a group in there.
