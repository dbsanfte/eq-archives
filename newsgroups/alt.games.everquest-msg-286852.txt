Agreed, it's not as bad as the bump from 65-70 was, but still annoying.  Level
caps are lazy game design.

Yup.  They fixed all the large broken-ness soon after it was added.  The
shadowstep is problematic in a lot of areas - not for bugs, but because in
tight quarters it can be very bad to move 10 feet in the wrong direction.

WoB is a reactive proc mez.  Every time you get hit, there's a chance your
attacker will get mezzed for 3 ticks.  Resistable, and doesn't fire every
time, but often enough that you pretty much never want to be without
it.   10 minute duration, though, without extension.

>where do you duo/trio at 75? what's a good charm zone?

We've been doing Katta missions a lot recently, trying to get faction for
armor and rank 2 spells (pirate missions before that, got the rank 1s pretty
fast).  Most zones have a lot of L74 and under mobs that charm fairly well -
our normal routine is to malo/tash/charm a random mob, root another mob, let
them fight.  With a pet armed but not hasted (it eats us too fast on a break
if I haste it), and the target slowed and dotted up the wazoo, we usually kill
3-4 targets, then break charm and kill the last 10% of the pet.

It's basically charm soloing for me and root/rot soloing for her, but way
faster and safer than either alone.  Add a cleric and we usually start healing
the pet, just to reduce downtime on switching.

I don't do math or parsing, but here's what I see.  The chromatic nuke
(L73), lists at 1892, I have an improved damage V focus (capped at 70,
but does some good above that) and most (maybe all, I should check) of the
crit nuke AAs.  Normal nukes are up to about 2200, and I crit maybe 1/5
of the time, usually in the 4400-4900 range.

Oh, Gift of Mana and Radiant Mana are conveniences as well - they don't go off
all that often, but a free cast of any spell is nice.  Hmm. I should see if it
works on the crystal AAs...

I seem to do that a lot, and newer zones seem to have more see-invis mobs.

No, it's pretty much for fixing screwups.  It's VERY good for that, though.

11k mana, just over 10k HP, buffed.  Not large by raiding standards, but
way bigger than it was 2 expansions ago.  But I use a lot of mana - charm is
1200, rune is 600, mez (I often pbae then regular on mulitple mobs,
both are 450), Nuke is 550 or so.  By the time we're on our 3rd mob and charm
has broken once, I'm probably down 4k mana.  If things go bad, it's easy to
get low.

And even then, I probably only USE gather mana one in 10 missions.  It's
knowing it's there that makes it useful.

>does it come in handy on raids? i am probably not going to be doing
>much raiding (though if that changes i can just get this...)

I don't raid anymore, really.  I never used it much when I did.

>how does it work? it steals 1000 mana and gives you a crystal which

3000 to cast, gives you an instacast clicky crystal that gives you 1000.

No recast time on it, but it's lore and nodrop.

80% up to a total of 5k absorbed.  Not perfect, just nice.

Fast recast, I keep it up when I think there's danger.
