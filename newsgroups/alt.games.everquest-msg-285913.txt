Thanks for your support on our website in the past! A new, great
service called "gold

recycle" has been put forward on our website. We strongly recommend
you to have a visit!

If you have excess gold in hand and are puzzled where to sell, don't
hesitate to visit our

site or contact us via MSN (ffxi@mmopawn.com) to make a deal.

If you decide to throw up playing the game and still have gold in
hand, you also could

contact us to make exchange for gold that could help you rich the
experience and speed up

your course in new game you try to turn to.

Thanks for your patience in reading this letter!
