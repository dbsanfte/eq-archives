Ooh, you can do a whois lookup. I shiver. Really, I do. You can't read
news headers, but that's OK. (My news server is news.cis.dfn.de). I
suppose I am a newbie to USENET. I've only been using it since 1991
(Accessed through a link I had setup on my BBS to the newsserver at
the U of Cal Irvine), and admining servers (off and on) since 1995. As
I started working abuse in 1997, there are several people to whom I am
a newbie.

What, exactly, would you report me for? Disagreeing with you? 
Fire away, if it will make you feel better. the abuse@ addresses for
DFN.de and Qwest.net are fully operational. They get plenty of reports
along those lines from a wide variety of sources for a variety of
users. One more won't make much difference.

BTW: I am quite aware that DFN.de lists my IP. I won't use a
newsserver that does not. Nor, when I admined newsservers, would I
peer with one that would not. DFN does nice filtering of spam and
abusive newsservers like alt.net, and are free. Easier than running my
own server.
