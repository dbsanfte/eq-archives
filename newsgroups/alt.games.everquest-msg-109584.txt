No, there really is a lot of suckass bad players out there
legitimately with hundreds of days played.

I used to think EQ was easy. Then I saw how many people fuck it up.
Now I don't know if its easy or the average of its player base are
just idiots.

It *does* get better as one gets higher level, though. It never maxes
out - theres a ton of idiot L60s - but there are less idiot L60s than
L20s. This should go without saying, I suppose, the real point is that
idiots can actually get that high. Depressing.

One more friggin non assisting nuker and I may wig out....
