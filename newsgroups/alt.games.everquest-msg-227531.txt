and unless someone comes out ands says that they bought plat and got 
<insert spiffy item> in bazaar how would you know? I know i dont have 
the money to pay for a leveling service, nor do i have the money to buy 
plat or items or an account online, heck some months it can be hard for 
me to pay my subscription costs and food...

I play on SolRo, and at my level i play with peoples mid 50s alts from 
serious raid guilds, i know people in serious raid guilds that have 
things i will never get to see, and i play with people like me, the mid 
50 is their main, and they have alts that are lower...and who have saved 
their plat to buy stuff that the raid guilds flog on their mules...I 
know that i will upgrade items and pass the old ones down to an alt, or 
give them to a guildie/friend/random person who might need it...and i 
know many people who do the same.

I have no way of knowing if my buddy machder bought his prismatic brawl 
stick or got it by rolling, nor do i particularly give a care. My buddy 
palledine has no way of knowing if i bought the jade reaver i gave him 
for his alts epic, or if i won it on a roll [won it on a roll as if it 
really matters] but I do know that both of these 65 raiders will in 
return help me on my epic kills [and palle will replace the reaver when 
my baby ranger is ready to get epiced.] As far as I know, both leveled 
up their mains themselves...though as long as they can play the class, i 
really dont care if they ebayed them. [ok, i admit, i have known palle 
since he was a level 50....but i met machder as a 65 and have no clue if 
he leveled or ebayed...nor do i care.]
