Even better, take the stones to the gypsy camp in North Karana. If you
give regular lightstones to one woman, you get one of the two research
guides and experience. If you give her greater lightstones, you get a
concordance of research with a bigger bump of experience. You can then
sell the books to the merchant next to her for cash (my halfling druid
with 65 CHA can get a bit more than 7pp for the concordance; my erudite
Enchanter with 85 CHA, Illusion: Human and Alliance can get more than
8pp.) If you are more in need of experience than money, that would be the
way to go... but trust me: run with camo and either go with a strong
group or ask higher level characters in the zone (some seem to always be
at the gypsies) to watch your back. You do NOT want to solo griffons
quite yet! My druid is still doing this at 16th level (whenever she runs
between Qeynos and Freeport) and offers SoWs to anyone who will watch for
mobs. Never had the offer turned down, and it HAS saved me from death on
more than one occasion.
