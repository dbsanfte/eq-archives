Definately not. EJ has the highest concentration of midlevel animals
on no faction in Norrath. My ranger got several levels there
fearkiting, never died once, and never had a single problem with lack
of mobs until the zone went light blue. The mob concentration level is
huge, you never have far to go to find one. And like any zone, once
you spend a bit of time to learn it, its not nearly as scary or
mysterious.

Most people don't even know there is a road that leads directly to the
CoM entrance.

I only wish I had a zone to go to like EJ now. :-(

One thing EJ lacked was named mobs, though.
