Proper delegations of roles is better, IMHO.  That way you leave no
room for misunderstandings.

That "medding and healing" is the job of a cleric is a simplification.
They can fill more than that niche, which can be repetetive and
boring.  It is a poor cleric, however, who in a group uses all
available mana on nukes.

At my level of experience (around 30), the anti undead dd spells comes
at the following levels:

Necro, level 29, dismiss undead 90 mana
Cleric, level 24, dismiss undead 90 mana

Clerics gets this earlier, but the necro have other means of harming
monsters as well. (slow, dot, debuff).  This is hard to discuss, since
both taste, tactics, and experience differs.  I think necros may have
an easier time doing this with less backup.  A cleric is lots safer
with a good tank at his side.

Dismiss undead is a very cheap undead nuke, and both necro and cleric
use less mana with these spells than a wizard does with his more
general spells.

I know one cleric who has done most of her XP'ing solo, and has maxed
and specialized in evocation skills.  She's not a good healer, but she
sure knows what to do as undead nuker, which she considers her
specialization.

Indeed.

Indeed, and do note down their names.  It will save you a surprise for
later.  :-)
