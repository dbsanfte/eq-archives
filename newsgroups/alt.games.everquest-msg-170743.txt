Had something frighteningly similar happen to me yesterday.  When I'm on my
magician and asked about virtue I always respond that I don't have it, but
it's not a priority.  But I do expect to get it when the cleric has a moment
and some mana.

Of course this means that my virtue is out of sync with everyone else.  So
yesterday my group is merrily fighting along and we get a 3-pull (and had a
truly badly equipped warrior) and the cleric pops off DVA two seconds after
my virtue wore off.

*splat* flat magician.

I had to scroll back up to even figure out why I died.  :)
