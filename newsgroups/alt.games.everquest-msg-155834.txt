    Have fun!

    Cool. Now imagine the other mages that feel the same way as you do, but
who DO want to play in the "endgame". Who don't want to go back to doing
things they've already done before. They're a little unhappy that they now
have no real use beyond what a bot could do.

    Then don't do it. If your guild tells you to drop rods all day long, and
you don't like that, you know what to do - /guildremove and gate. Our
necromancers are already serving notice that they want no part of a strategy
where they're dedicated mana feeders. So now we're deciding if we can do
without that function at raids, or if we just toss the necromancers and add
more clerics in their place.

    But our mages are devastated. They didn't love pooping out mod rods, but
they knew they were important to the raid in a way they never were before.
They also realized that a LOT of classes aren't exactly thrills to play -
clerics on the CH chain, all the melees that turn on auto-attack then hit
the special attack button when it ungreys for the next 10 minutes. At least
one of our mages is waiting to see if PoP gives him back an important role,
and if not, will be retiring. Great change - make him feel useless so people
that don't want to do something don't have to grow enough spine to say "no".

    There's at least one shield that drops in Ssra, caster-usable, that had
a right-click Rune effect. With mod rods, it made soloing reasonably fast
and fun for our mages. They also seem to enjoy their epic pets, which last
time I checked weren't found as ground spawns or on vendors in The Bazaar.
And the gloves they're getting in Vex Thal today are going to be the new
focus items for their PoP pets.
