But it's NOT a weapon per se, it goes in the hand slot, doesn't it?
Why compare it to 1hb then?

But if fist is _slow_ (see Khosh's post) and low damage that would be
stupid, wouldn't it?  You'd skill up faster and do more damage while
you're at it by having one of these.  And you could still have a
higher damage weapon in one hand, couldn't you?  Or am I not correctly
understanding how H2H weapons work?
