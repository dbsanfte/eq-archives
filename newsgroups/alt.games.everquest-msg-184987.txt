Have you really seen from 40 to 400 people in the bazaar?  That would imply
that you got in just after server up (only time there are only 40) and that
the problem occured at that time.

6. It is happening to some people and not others.
7. We have been through this many times before when a patch introduces
changes that *some* peoples systems choke on.  In my case the fix was to
update my video/sound drivers.
8. In the past when "dozens of people" go down but not everyone in the zone,
it has been found that the problem was a section of the internet going down.
It happens.
9. It is my experience that networking code often chokes when the connection
is severed.  IOW when you connection goes south programs will often lock up
or CTD instead of giving it up gracefully.  This is not just eq but other
programs that communicate over the internet or other network.

I'm not saying eq doesn't have bugs, and I agree that they should write the
code to be more forgiving of old drivers and such.  But suggestions that
code is written to intentionally knock people off are extremely unlikely.
