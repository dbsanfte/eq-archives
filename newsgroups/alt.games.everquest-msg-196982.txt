It seems to me the flagged players already GOT their reward, whatwith
levels and loot, before the floodgates are opened.   Why should there
be additional rewards for players, some who merely got flagged because
they belonged to an uber guild that pushed them through trials?  Why
am I penalized because I showed guild loyalty and didn't leave for an
uber guild?  I'm a 62 shammy that, although receiving a dozen tells a
day for tier 2 planes, most groups saw as a waste of a trials slot.
The rest of the guild isn't trial ready (40's and low 50's).   Why
should I be penalized when the dynamics of the trials, by Sony's own
design, frowned upon those who don't do high DPS and slowing/debuffing
is moot?

Yea, maybe it's sour grapes but let me tell you, they taste like crap.
