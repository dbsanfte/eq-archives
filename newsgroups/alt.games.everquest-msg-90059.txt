My PC hasn't listened to you. Runs absolutely no problem on my Geforce 2 
MX card (32 MB). New models turned on. Although I turn animation off.

Rest of PC is an Ath 1 Gig, 512MB RAM.

I would suggest upgrading the Memory as its so cheap at the moment, I 
would be surprised if this did not provide benefit. As Geforce 2 MX 400 
is so cheap would recommend that. Although I have heard great things 
about the Geforce 3 cards - just my budget won't go to that - yet :(
