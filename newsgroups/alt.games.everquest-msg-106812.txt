Nope.  Not even close.  Bard charms last up to 18 seconds.  Enchanter
charms last minutes to hours.

It's a great crowd-control technique, especially in areas where you
never get more than two mobs at a time.  However, some enchanters like
charming mobs that are very tough for their level, buffing the hell
out of them, dropping some fairly nice weapons on them, and having a
real pet for a while.  Depending on your skill and luck, yes, it is
useful and dangerous.  As you get more experienced the use will
increase and the danger will subside.  Until something goes terribly,
terribly wrong and you have an ultra-hasted, 4-armed mob with Centi
Longswords and a bad attitude turn on the party at exactly the wrong
moment.

Bards who charm must be able to time.  I love charm, both solo and in
groups.  Solo, I can do silly stuff, because I know what I'm trying to
do, or can at least guess.  In a group, I have to ensure my group
knows what I'm doing, so charming is very regular.  Charm the add, sic
it on the tank's target, twist 3 songs (or 2 pulses of a single song)
to time, re-target mob (hit f1 twice), re-charm.  Repeat.  Charm
should break about 1 second before the charm song pulses once you get
the timing down.  If the bard is really lazy, he just has to charm the
mob, leave the charm song playing, and /assist the main tank.  The
song will recharm the mob on the next pulse, unless the bard is
stunned.  
A bard who is getting beat up while charming needs to learn to charm.
You'll get hit a bit in tight dungeon fighting, but that just teaches
you to time your songs better.  It sounds like your bard doesn't know
how to recharm, and doesn't know how to communicate.
