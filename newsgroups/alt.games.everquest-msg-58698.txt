So you see, it's not a rule, but a Guideline.  Also, the wording is ambiguous
because it says, "...or include just enough text of the original to give a context."

The spirit of this guideline says to me "give context because of the timing of the
arrival of messages may leave out the original for some time".  It doesn't say,
"Thou shalt post at the top or feel the wrath of the Lord (usenet users)."
