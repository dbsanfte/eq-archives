Depends what you mean by "effective". If you look at the damage done it
will be less. The pet's hardly a killing machine but that's not the
real point of it. The main point is to keep the mobs of you. In my
experience it makes it a lot less risky taking on marginal mobs.
Assuming you run at the right time it's only the pet that should get it
and not you.

Not to mention there are "other" uses for it. I.e. spot an easy green
mob and a harvest node? Set the pet on the mob while you harvest! Need
to kill some greys? Get the pet to do it while you get another one,
hence halving the time the quest will take. Spot a red in you way? Set
the pet on it while you run safely past.

Much more "effective" in my books.
