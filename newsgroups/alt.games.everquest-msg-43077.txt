This is the only part of your excellent post that I disagree with
slightly.  IME, most groups tend to be a bit overoptimistic about
their chances for survival, possibly because many of them can't see
the whole situation.  Too many times, my druid, dancing around in
back, has seen that there isn't really a chance in hell the group's
going to make it out of this and has kept asking, "Hey guys, what
about an Evac?" over and over, and gotten no response or an
equivocating one.  There's nothing that makes me feel worse than
people dying when I could have gotten them out.

IMO, the final decision has to rest with the druid, although letting
the group know beforehand that you will evac when *you* think it's
called for is obviously a good idea.  If people bitch afterwards that
they could have handled the mobs, just remind them that everyone's
still alive and there are always more mobs.  Taking the heat for
rescuing everyone is part of your job :)
