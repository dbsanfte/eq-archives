Since he's asking about the price of essence emeralds, the
desirability of necromancers on raids has nothing to do with
the topic.

Essence emeralds are relatively cheap because most raiding
guilds will have members with alts they can sacrifice.  It's
just not worthwhile paying for them when you can sacrifice
a random level 46 alt and powerlevel the XP back in minutes.
Remember, a level 46 alt can group with a guild's 60s and get
XP.  It doesn't take long to 'earn' back a sacrificed death
at 46 when a group of five 60s is powerleveling you on even
or higher cons.

That leaves the market to guilds just getting up to that level
and solo necros who want one so they can self-rez, both of
which are relatively small markets.  And, for the above reasons,
if they WERE expensive, lots of players with 46+ alts would
just drive the price down.
