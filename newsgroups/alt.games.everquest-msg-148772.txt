Huh?  The Staff of Temperate Flux is only one of the best easily quested
items in the ENTIRE GAME.  I challenge you to find a better item, in fact,
obtainable untwinked at level 30 that will do more for you.  I'm guessing
you can't.  Let's count the benefits:  mana-free, insta-cast, range finder,
spell gem refresher, aggro-on-request, pulling device, debuffer, faction
tagger ...  This is my favorite item, hands down.

And I hope you're not also disregarding the benefits of an (again, easily
obtainable) instacast buff item as well (Acumen Mask), that also has the
side benefit of granting you +5 INT.

Heh, maybe it's just because I'm not uber, but I rather like them.

Nevala
