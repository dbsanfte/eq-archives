I always assumed they would do this. I was pretty sure they would do
it shortly after Plane of Time was breached.

The reward for passing all of the flagging/keying was to get there
first. That is a HUGE advantage in the end game. Based on the schedule
they've kept up, I imagine we'll be seeing announcements for an
upcoming expansion within the next sixty days.

The biggest objection to PoP was that most players 61+ were stuck in
PoV/PoS and, if they were luckly, BoT. I'm in the fourth or fifth most
advanced guild on my server and have yet to get past those three, as
do my guildmates.

80% of PoP was reserved for 10% of the player base. Didn't you suspect
that wouldn't last?
