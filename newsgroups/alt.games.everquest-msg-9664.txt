National Guard pretty eliminates the need for milita.  I hate to tell all
you hand gun owners and shotgun owners but I was in the military and could
hit a man sized target at 300M.  No shotgun or handgun made could offer any
resistance to a military crisis of any kind unless the conflict was purely
urban or close combat aka jungle warfare.  Civilian rifles are nice but
can't sustain the firepower and the effective ones are extremely cost
prohibitive.    This doesn't even begin to account for autonomatic support
weapons or heavy artillery.   Couple that will the minimal training of most
gun owners and the general tendacies of hotheads not to work together and
you have an ineffective militia.  Now there are some highly organized
exceptions to this but most gun owners fall into the former.  The concept of
a militia is dated though I must admit it is still legal by the law.  I am
all for gun owenership but it would not even be remotely effective to
offering a resistance against military troops.

I won't post on this topic again as this is an EQ board.  Sorry to those who
care.
