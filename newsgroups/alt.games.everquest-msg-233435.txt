I've run into this issue before. I combat this with "Look pal, a Dot costs 
me around 12 plat. I do not run a charity here. 12 plat is a small price to 
pay for a buff that will help you as much as a temp will" (I dont have 
virtue yet). They like it or they lump it.

I *do* do charity rezzes, usually in the Planes, and I usually ask that the 
corpse already be in the GY when I arrive. Likewise, if someone OOCs while 
I am exping that they need a rez, I tell them to drag the corpse and not 
bring a train. Any donations I may receive for this I share with my group, 
as "my" mana is "our" mana in a fast paced group.

My favorite was the Ranger that bitched after he got aggro and got turned 
into pink mist. He saw the "CHeal INC FOR MA"[1] call, and got aggro. I 
suspect he expected me to interrupt my cast and heal *him*, despite the 
fact I was 1/2 done with it, the tank was at 20%, and we were fighting reds 
on WW in Valor.


That guy I laid into. "Look, I'm sorry, but the MA > All. You saw the cheal 
message, you should have realized no heal was forthcoming and jolted or 
kited or something."

Healing priorites and other considerations can make us seem bitchy- we are 
integral to a good group (more than any other class for a standard group) 
and so we learn that we do not have to put up with some stupid puller that 
pulls when I say "LOM need a med", or a wizzy that nukes from the second 
the "Inc" is called despite being told not to, etc. I think some of the 
greedy misconception comes from the peridot issue. 

I always feel selfish when I have a party member low on life and I have to 
heal myself first. I *know* it's the right thing to do for the groiup as a 
whole, but it still chaps my ass.
