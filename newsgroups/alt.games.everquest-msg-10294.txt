I seriously doubt that it had been attacked by the other party at the time I
started attacking it. They were both busy fighting the first wisp, and not
looking in the direction of the second wisp. It is more likely to me that I
didn't get a hit it before it reached the other party, or that joining the
other wisps fight had higher priority than responding to whatever damaged I
had inflicted on it at that time.
