    Bandage-soloing is quite possible for warriors of fairly high levels,
especially if they have gear above that level (Cobalt, Fungi, good
haste/weapons). My warrior at 36 once plowed through five blues, one after
the other with just enough time to bandage to 50% between, in Lower Guk
because the dead side zone had nobody there and I needed to get to my BR
group. (I was lucky, though - no WIZ mobs.)
