It should be easy to make a pristine item if the difficulty of the
item is easy. But that's not the case, even things are "very easy"
still have about a %40 failure rate, and you can be sure that if you
do get to near the end of process it will fail 6 times in a row so you
fail on making it pristine lol. Really sucks considering how long it
takes you to make any final item.

I'm finding tradeskills very annoying. To make a final item you have
to make 3 components of which each requires 3 components... you end
needing to make like 15 separate items just to make something .. each
one of these items takes around 30-40 seconds to produce, let alone
the time spent running between stations, going back to the merchant
when you find you've run out of something again... your looking at
spending about 20-30 minutes just to make a single final item.

They need to speed the whole process up. I don't want sit here for 30
seconds on each piece of stretch of tanned leather I need to make.
It's a trivial basic component of all tanned leather items and you
need to make truckloads of them, I got better things to do than sit
here for 30 minutes just making a stack of it before I even begin to
make any actual items.

If it's trivial it should just go ding ...finished and take like 2
seconds. 

They can scale it upwards... so those new recipes you just got would
be "extremely difficult" and -then- you can spend like 60 seconds
trying to make it and you actually need to "play" by using appropriate
tradeskill spells to alter you progress/durability, and the chances of
getting an extremely difficult item to pristine would be like %5 ...
the rating of the item should be how hard it is to get it pristine...
"very easy" .... "extremely difficult" .. say %90 to %5

Basically what i'm saying is ... as an item gets easier to make so
should the time to make it get shorter.

Cheers,
