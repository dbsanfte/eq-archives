Welcome to the ranger class, the Ranger's Glade website is a great
place to get advice.

Since you mention Faydarks, you must be a wood-elf ranger.  In that
case, you don't need the torch at all, just equip the shield in your
secondary slot, until you reach level 17.

By the time you reach level 9, you will have spell casting ability.
Remember to get a Fire Beetle Eyes in you inventory slot, and keep it
there at all time, the "Flame lick" spell need that component to cast.

You also mentioned you are on the newbie server, what is your
character's name?  If you post your name, and the time you most likely
on-line, I can get on and show you around a bit.
