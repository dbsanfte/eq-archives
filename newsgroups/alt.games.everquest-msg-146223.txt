Here you have a community crossing all servers, and all actively
interested in discussion about the game.  None of them (well
not many) are actively playing at the same time you are asking
the questions, so they have time to reflect, perhaps even do
a spot of research.

My guild is certainly a resource, shout and ooc far less so,
but I'll tell you, for interesting detailed discussion of EQ issues
nothing beats this newsgroup for me, and the only thing
that comes in a close second is the serverwide.age chat
channel!
