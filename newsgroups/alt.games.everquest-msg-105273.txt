It's an indoor zone:  that doesn't make it a dungeon.  (Ak'Anon,
Shadow Haven, etc. aren't dungeons.)  It has caves with creatures
in it:  that doesn't make it a dungeon either (Great Divide has caves,
as does Hollowshade Moor, Steamfont Mountains, etc).  Many dungeons
are one-way zones (Crushbone, Infected Paw, Seb, Chardok) but some
are "pass-through" zones (Blackburrow, Runnyeye) so that's not a valid
measure.

So what is it that makes you say NL is obviously a dungeon
in every way?
