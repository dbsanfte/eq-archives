Whats the rock for? I have a few banked ;)

Oh, and as for merchants...

My own ebony blades in Oggok at about level 37. Damn those FS carrying
guards!

My very first non-rusty longsword. Cost me 15pp I think. I subsequently
found it for sale for 9pp in the bards guild where I had better
faction. Then I discovered this thing called "Fine steel" that other
players on Faydwer were sellign - they were real high levels and
had started hunting in a terrifying place called "The mansion of Unrest"

Various gems and pelts ;)

I dont think I've ever seen anything really spectacular on a vbendor
that I havent (doh!) put there myself first by mistake ;) ;) ;)
