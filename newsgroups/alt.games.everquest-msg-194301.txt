Firstly, its just 1 mob.  He paths from the corner (around where you'd setup
a raid) into the king room, and then back, continously.

Im pretty sure he sees invis... once you get to the "palace", things like
sneak, invis become very mob-specific.

Anyway he isn't that tough, you just need somebody to tank it while a cleric
is CoH'd in, and monks/sk's are the best choice, they don't need to rely on
healers being there (just FD when low hp, and the next one takes over agro),
plus mend/taps.. should give you enough time to get a tank, cleric, *snarer*
there.  Note- if he runs, your dead.

Failing that, the next "safe" spot is around number 7 on the map
