That was the regen HP tunic, right?  There are some items that regen HP
in combat... I know some gloves that make me go cross-eyed with envy
dropped off the first group of skellies in the Firemyst Gully Epic
instance (out of a silver chest).  They had a ton of stats/resists and
something like 34hp/tick in-combat HP regen.

There is some in-combat and out of combat power regen items, so I'm
guessing there are HP regen items.  I just dont think we found them yet.
