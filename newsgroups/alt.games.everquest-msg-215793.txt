A great item for low level pets is the Fist of Bone, which drops in
Shadeweaver's Thicket and is usually found on vendors there in quantity.  They
have the same damage advantage that a rusty two hander does, but cost a silver
instead of a platinum, and more importantly weight a fraction of a pound instead
of ten pounds; carrying around a couple backpacks of the things won't break your
poor mage's back.  No need to bother with this after hitting 12th level, pet
will by that point do the same damage without a weapon.

All the Sol Ro focus items have a clicky Reclaim Energy, which kills your pet
and gives you some mana back.  Pet Get Lost is a command for the use of those
who don't have their focus yet; both suffer from the drawback that they only
work at close range; having an insta invis might be nice if you want to be able
to kill your pet at extreme distances (for example, he has aggro but is far
enough away that the mobs won't come find you).  Other than that, its not really
important till you get up so high in levels/AA that you can charm summoned mobs
as pets; charmed mobs won't go away on orders, and can't be reclaimed, breaking
charm on demand calls for invis.

Splendid
