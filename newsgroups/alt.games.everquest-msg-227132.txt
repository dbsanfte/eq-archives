Jeebus, that's before my time here even, I think. Anyway, yanno, if
you're going to develop emotional attachments toward someone online
without making sure they're who you think they are first, you're
setting yourself up for disaster. Most men who play female characters
will never intentionally lead anyone on to thinking they're really a
girl. Even the roleplayers, if ask OOC, they'll tell you straight up
OOC. Heck, many will even say without being asked at some point,
especially if it appears someone's having a little trouble blurring IC
and OOC. :p
