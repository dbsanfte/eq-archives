No, they're pets, and lower-level than the skeletons, so
root will probably both stick AND last.  Like all pet class
mobs, they'll send the pets at you and then stand back and
cast for a while before closing.  It's easier to just root
the pets and deal with the more dangerous mob first.  Besides,
the pets don't drop anything - kill the ones that gets you
your drop and then just Gate out.

Not IMO, at least not at level 32.  You'd still need the hearts,
anyway, and you have zero chance of getting those solo anyway.
Might as well get a group willing to help you and get all
three missing parts in one session.
