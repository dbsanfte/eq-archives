Hiya, 

  I was wondering if I could get some feedback on the lvl 65 hard
adventures in LDoN. About all I know about them is that the trash mobs
hit for around 900. I'm debating trying a couple with a 'defnitely
not-uber' group, I know we wouldn't have a chance of winning it but
some of the drops I've seen from the hard adventures might make them
worthwhile just for the loot even if you take a couple of losses. 

The best tank I group with on a regular basis is a SK with 200+ AAs
and some VT/elemental gear. Unfortunately he's on European time so
about the only chance I get to group with him in on weekends. Could he
handle the mobs on hard with a slower? How about a SK with around
50AAs? 

How much tougher are the named on hard adventures? Can a group that
can take the normal mobs there take a named? 

Do mobs there mitigate slow? 

Can a chanter mez there easily if you assume tash and malo? 

Any guesstimate as to hitpoints on the mobs? 

Can a bard dependably pull singles on hard?

Group would probably be cleric, chanter, SK, pally, shaman and druid;
lacking in DPS and definitely not uber by anyone's definition. Any
comments as to viability would be appreciated, or any comments in
general from people that have tried hard. 

Rgds, Frank
