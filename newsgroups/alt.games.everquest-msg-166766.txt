Actually, the XP doesn't go up nearly that fast.  It would go from 5000 to
6920, not 20000, making it 15 kills needed.

Level 51 mobs are still dark blue at 60, aren't they?  If so, then it would
still be 5000 XP for the level 60 who kills a level 51 mob.

Yup...and that is a good illustration of why greens don't give XP.  If they
did not cut it off, then one level 60 mob would give the same XP as killing
4 level 30 mobs, or 16 level 15 mobs.

So, as a level 55 Wizard, I could go to North Karana, and kill Scythe
Beetles, for example.  They are level 17-19, so lets call it 18.  My 215
mana, ~650 damage nuke will kill one (they have ~530 HP).  Without any mana
regen bufs, it takes under a minute to med back that mana.  So, I could kill
level 18 mobs at one per minute all day.

Compare to level 40 mobs, which is what I typically solo.  It takes about 5
minutes to med back the mana from one of those.

5 level 18 mobs give 1620*Z XP (where Z is the zone modifier).  One level 40
mob gives 1600*Z XP.

So, I'd come out slightly ahead blasting beetles in NK!  The risk would be
way lower, too.

I'm not even going to calculate what I could do using PB AoE on level 10ish
mobs (which would also be safe, because even though I'm a robe wearing
Wizard who hasn't even tried to boost AC, level 10 mobs can swing at me all
day and not do much damage, or stop me from getting a spell off).

Brutal is a good description.  Before 61, at every ding, your cutoff point
for blues does one of two things:

(1) It moves up by one

(2) It stays where it is

So, as you level up to 60, the blue range never gets narrow.  The worst it
does at some levels is fail to get wider.
