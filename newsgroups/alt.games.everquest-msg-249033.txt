So why not go through their server data and find characters who've
been played for years, including recently, with no change of owner
data, and then invite the owners of those accounts?  (Or better yet,
find accounts with multiple experienced characters, but you get the
idea.)  Sure, they'd be excluding some people who've changed their
credit card numbers or whatever, but they'd still have a lot of
experienced players to choose from.  Enough that they could then
filter the selection to include some from top-end raiding guilds,
some from family guilds, etc.
