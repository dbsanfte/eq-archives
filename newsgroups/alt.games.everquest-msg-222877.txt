EXTREMELY low as compared to DC. Virginia's rape rate per 1000 is 13%
of DCs. How is that noe EXTREMELY low in comparison? Espescially since
it's right over the bridge.

And it's hard to get more current data. I showed a peak in 1992, and
then the most current data available from the FBI. The years in
between were basically in between those numbers, which is why I showed
it.
