Home wireless networks should have no problem at all.  It's just satellite
wireless providers that have lag.  Even land based wireless providers
*should* have no problem.  I was with sprint wireless for awhile and pings
were very low at first.  But they didnt have the bandwidth or something
cause it really went to hell after about 6 months.
