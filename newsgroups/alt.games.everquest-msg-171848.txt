Ah, so the problem is breaking mez incorrectly to begin with, not having the
right equipment.

It is easier to do the math if you are actually starting with the correct
figures.  SoV/VoG is indeed 42 minutes.  WR is 18.4 (at level 58) to 20.5
(at level 65) minutes depending on the level of the caster.  So, um, You Do
The Math (tm).

Here is a link to the spell info for WR.
