Well, if it works once per fight, and lets me save about 15% hp per 
fight, its not a bad thing.  I can't imagine it will ever work enough to 
consistently fear kite thru a whole fight, but every second that it does 
work is time when I'm doing damage and the mob isn't, which means if the 
fight is tough, its more likely I'll make it, and if its easy, then its 
that much less down time.

This, oddly, is the reason I'm playing one; I'm reasonably familiar with 
the other classes, but couldn't get a handle on what the heck berserkers 
are or are for.  I'm getting a feel for em now; DPS class with snare, 
seems to be the job.

I got a small group in Everfrost yesterday, me 26 berzerk, 27 cleric, 30 
beastlord.  We were doing mammoths and things, but then tried the icy 
orcs/redwind camp.  Cleric pulled and dropped dead from Rewind plus two 
Icy.  Beastlord and I killed Redwind, then split up and each took an 
Icy.  My orc was dead before he got his down to 30% hp.

Its possible that my orc was a level lower than his, but both were blue 
to me at 26... and he had 4 levels on me, including a level where he got 
a new pet.

I'm not, however, in much you could call twink gear; most slots are 
newbie quest armor, nothing I own cost me more than 20pp in the bazaar, 
my weapon is a shissar claidmore (22/40) which cost me 19pp.  Was 
totally unbuffed, even by said cleric and beastlord.

I'm thinking that the beastlord was dual boxing the cleric, and playing 
neither character well... but it was fun to outdamage something I tend 
to think of as one of the premier DPS classes out there.

Grage, 26 Berzerk, Luclin
