There is little point in that. But you stepped into this of your own
free will, reap what you sowed.

Correcting you is the least of my concerns. You made a stupid pedantic
post for no reason since it was patently obvious at that point
Vladesch was not a sockpuppet, and anyone who doesn't know how to
check for it shouldn't be the one doing the insinuating. If it bothers
you that you get called on this, don't make stupid pedantic posts in
the future.

Insinuation is merely accusation by implication. Pretending there is a
difference is pedantic at best and ignorant at worst. Feel free to
educate me on which you were being.


insinuation

n : an indirect (and usually malicious) implication [syn: innuendo]

4. That which is insinuated; a hint; a suggestion or intimation by
distant allusion; as, slander may be conveyed by insinuations.

I scorn your coarse insinuation. --Cowper.

Syn: Hint; intimation; suggestion. See Innuendo.

"Bad enough when the dead come walking," he said to Jon as they crossed
 the village, "now the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will
 come of *that*, I'll warrant. And who's to say the bones wouldn't lie?
 Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely
 dull fellows, full of tedious complaints - 'the ground's too cold, my
 gravestone should be larger, why does *he* get more worms than I do....'"

- Dolorous Edd Tollett, "Clash of Kings" (George R R Martin)
