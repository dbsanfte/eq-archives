  I've got a level 30 druid I'm fairly happy with. He's grouped most of 
his career, as soloing bores me. Lately, though, he's been going solo to 
find some items for various quests, and I'm starting to notice that his 
spells are getting resisted a lot more than you'd imagine.
  Even things that are deep, deep green to him are resisting spells at 
annoyingly high rates. All his spell skills are either maxed out for his 
level or within a few points of it, and his wisdom's just shy of 200, so 
I can't figure out what's going on. Any ideas?

I didn't mean to offend you. Should I like, change my 
attitude? Should I change my whole way of  being? Huh? 
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. BITE ME HARD!"
