A couple of route to take (assuming group of similar level):

A 'popular' route:

Newbie zone till lvl 5
Crushbone till lvl 16
Paludal Caverns till lvl 24
High Hold Keep till lvl 34
Dawnshroud Peaks / Overthere till lvl 40
Echo Caverns / Dreadlands till lvl 46+
Plane Of Justice Exit / Basement camps till lvl 55
Plane of Valor till lvl 62
BoT till lvl 65

Of all these places, crushbone probably requires the most skill :)
(depending on camp).

An alternative route:

Newbie zone till lvl 5
Blackburrow till lvl 12-15
Estate of Unrest until lvl 30 (can go to 35 here though).
Split Paw until lvl 34
Gulf Of Gunthak until lvl 40
Dulak first boat till 45ish
Nadox elementals till lvl 50 (not sure if enough for a full group here, and
some pulls through lava etc, plenty of other stuff around).
Old sebilis till lvl 55 (need a key)
After seb, pop is probably the best route, aside from plane of valour you
can try Pof Storms, Crypt of Decay.

As to what to look for in a group? A healer of some descrition is always a
plus :)

For myself, I tend to level in various different zones for all my
characters, and have never had a set route for any of them.
