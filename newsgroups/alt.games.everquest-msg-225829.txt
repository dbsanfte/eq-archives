I think I missed something (happens often, I was going over the article
first thing in the morning).  Why would the Shamans be unhappy?  I think all
the folks that focused on upping their stamina would be more unhappy.

HEY, we're not *all* lumbering!  Seriously, I can strategize pretty well,
I'm just being a bit selfish.  I liked knowing I could log in as my Warrior
and leave most of that up to someone else for once, and just enjoy my

Bingo.  Which a simple fix to taunt could do.  The extra abilities would be
gravy--delicious, creamy gravy, with just a few lumps, like Mom used to
make.
