This varies too, server to server as all prices.

On Morell-Thule, when I started playing, a HQ bear pelt cost 10-15 pp, and a
BP sold for 50 pp.

Now, most of the bear killers, sell for not less than 20 pp per HQ skin, and
I try to drive the price for the backpacks up, asking 60 pp each.

I very often get the reply, "dude, 50 pp is THE price for backpacks" and I
start ranting about supply, demand and raw material costs... but end up
selling them for 50 pp anyway...

/em goes into the cryochamber waiting for the patch message stating that
bazaars are activated.
