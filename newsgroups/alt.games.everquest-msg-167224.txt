It's the standard.  Get used to it.  You'll figure out who posts 
information and who posts to make themselves feel good believing that 
someone else out there in net'land thinks they are smart and humerous.

I bet with myself on threads ( the guy next to me doesn't like EQ so won't 
bet ), guessing which ones will "turn to mush."  I'm pretty damned good at 
it after all this time here.  For example - there's a thread I killed with 
John Smith in the title.  The second I read it, I had no doubt it would be 
a huge "I know more than you about the subjec" thread.  I guessed it would 
last about 4-5 days.  It's harder these days to see if I win these vapor 
bets because I started killing threads.

Typical progression: Someone states something.  Next person nitpics it for 
not being 100% correct in an effort to show the rest they know more about 
it, and tosses in a smiley.  OP replies explaining they knew that, and 
usually throws in a jibe back, which starts the shit.  Typically, Mr. 
Nitpic is a NG regular who spends more time flaming and tossing out cheap 
humor than information.

It's the standard.  Get used to it.
