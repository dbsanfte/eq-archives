That was a good read G =)

I would like to add there are some really good websites relating to EQ2 also
which I have found really useful so far.

Apart from eqplayers.com you can try:
 http://eq2.allakhazam.com/  -  free but if you pay the premium you get
heaps more search options as well as being able to use the subscription for
the other games listed.
http://www.eq2-artisan.com/  - lots of helpful stuff on tradeskilling and
harvesting.

http://www.gry-online.pl/eq2/index.asp - great maps and a handy "where am I
?" locator as well as quest info down the bottom of the page.

There is so much to do, I don't know where to start sometimes =)
