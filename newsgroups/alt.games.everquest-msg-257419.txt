I will likely use swiftwind until I have max worn atk and 41%+ haste item,
which could be a while.*

Earthcaller (which I just got recentley), will always be bagged, not often
used but being able to 50% slow a mob is  a handy too to have.

*For archery only, I use GSotFW for melee at the moment (with 34% haste
item).
