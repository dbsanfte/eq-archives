Wow, I attributed my EQ crashes to the heat of my new processor (which was
an issue, but resolved), but am still crashing.  Sometimes during the
patcher even!  Sometimes my whole system reboots.  No other game or program
is affected, so it's definitely EQ.  It turns out I'm getting the mysterious
error #628 in mainthread code that's on EQ's tech boards.  It seems to be
affecting mainly AMD users since the last patch.  Did I mention I upgraded
to AMD the day of the last patch???  DOH!!!

I certainly hope they nail this one down soon.  I can't play at all, dammit!
Anyone else who frequents this group getting this error?

Sean...
