While I usually agree with jaZZ, in this case I'm gonna give different 
advice.  If your bard friend is familiar with crowd-control, you should be 
OK.  What I would do is have the bard friend pull, and his level 8 song, 
Kelin's Lugubrious Lament, will help with single pulls.  If he gets 1, you 
can have the bard twist his level 50 Verses of Victory, which is a nice 
STR buff and a 30% haste buff; his level 51 Largo's Absonant Binding, 
which is a 35% slow AND a decent snare; and whatever 3rd song you think is 
useful.  If you get two mobs, he should charm one, and then probably 
either just stand back and let his pet attack while he twists VoV, get his 
pet attacking, join in, and then back off and re-charm every 18 seconds.  
This is an advanced tactic, and one that requires him to be familiar with 
3rd person view and several custom hotkeys.
I know that when I was 51ish, we did a couple hole raids and I was fine 
duoing at the ent before the raid with a 50ish druid.  I've seen 50ish 
bards soloing there too, so I wouldn't be too worried about giving it a 
try at least.
You can bind in Paineel, just about anywhere.  I prefer to bind by the 
pool in the newbie zone, it's about a 30 second walk to the zone then.  
You might want to have a mule camped there with an extra set of lockpicks 
if your warrior is too fat to swim through the sneaky way.
