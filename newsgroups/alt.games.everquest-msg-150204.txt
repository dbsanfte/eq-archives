Grr, I did.  I have this bad habit (or maybe keyboard...yeah, I'll blame the
keyboard) of starting to cast a long-casting spell (let's say KEI at 12
seconds) and then want to say something.  So I start typing...and when I get
to the space between words, I jump (don't know if that's default jump
key...been so long since I mapped my keys).

Or I almost run off cliffs or into non-aggroed critters 'cause I've hit hit
G by accident (autorun), then enter to bring up a chat window.  I've almost
left Sky that way and HAVE "pulled" critters that way ("no, seriously, I was
pulling!").

You happen to have a link to that hilarious story about "I am ACASRGF!?"
