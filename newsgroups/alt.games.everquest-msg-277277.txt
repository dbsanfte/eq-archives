I love taunting slap (app4), but suddenly it went red on me. I'm a 17
brawler and hit 110 % (freeport to qeynos betrayal). I checked it and the
skill requirement looks like it went up (to 88) or my brawling (85) down...
pretty unfortunate as i was fighting and my group thought i wasn't taunting
properly. I haven't heard of this before. Is this odd?
