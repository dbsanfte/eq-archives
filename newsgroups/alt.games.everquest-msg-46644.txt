Yeah some barbarians and such don't even KNOW they can wear medium
also. Some armorers don't also. I remember my barb shaman I started
eons ago on one of the first post beta server, sol ro. I was buying
banded from someone selling it and they saw I was a barbarian and
said, 

"oh darn this is medium though sorry you wear large."

then they just kept on auctioning it.

"Umm.. I want to purchase that .. and no I can wear medium also"

"no, you are a barbarian so you wear large."

AGAIN he just kept on auctioning it, about this time I was getting
pissed off. Finally I just said 

"OH ok but I am BUYING IT FOR A FRIEND WHO WEARS MEDIUM SO SELL IT TO
ME."

Then he finally sold it to me.
