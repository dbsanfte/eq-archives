IMHO I think that they would make tons of money because at $50 per move,
few will do it and fewer still would do it with more than one or 2
characters.  But for $5 (or even $10) per move, everyone could afford to
move one or 2 characters per month.  I believe that at the lower prices
there would be 100,000 to 200,000 moves per month for the first few
months.

Prediction: People will advertize for trades.  They'll each have a high
level, rich character that they want to move to the other's server. 
They'll start trading items and money from their rich characters to the
other player's mule.  When satisfied, they'll perform the character
moves and transfer the treasure from their mule to their main.  So, the
'no transfer of loot' only has meaning on the new servers where the loot
is still relatively scarce.  Of cource people have been doing this all
along, just without the character transfers.

/Begin paranoid conspiracy mode
(My personal belief / prediction: They are going to offer it at a price
lower than the $50 per move but they want to test the HTML code and the
character moving programs first.  So they are offering it first to a few
players at a special price.)
/End paranoid conspiracy mode
