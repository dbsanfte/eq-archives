    This word, "zerg". I do not think it means what you think it means.

    PoP was aimed at the raid crowd, but it did have stuff for other levels
of play. As examples, my enchanter went from 35 to 39 doing a PoP quest, two
of my lower level characters have Mana Preservation II rings thanks to PoP,
several tradeskillers on my server have been given many profitable new
recipes with PoP, the Tier I planes are filled with people that aren't in
an_elemental_guild01, and everyone gets use out of the port stones.

    LoY was aimed at the non-raid crowd. There's one real raid-level
encounter in the whole expansion, and you need to farm the everloving crap
out of a zone that offers scant else of use to a raid guild just to be able
to trigger the encounter. You would have thought SOE had learned from the
Horror Construct in CT that people won't do "farm to play" encounters, but
apparently not.

    In a few months, we'll get LDoN. Another expansion aimed squarely at
non-raid players. Meanwhile, the people who eat through content the fastest,
the raid folks, will be finished with PoP (they have three greater gods and
the final god left to slay) and looking for the next target. And if they
don't find it, they'll leave because that is what holds them playing this
game - raiding with their guild.

    No, I think they're demanding that SOME new content be suitable for a
raid force, since raiding is what they enjoy doing most in EQ. But we'll see
how many of "them" there are after the results are tabulated from the last
two polls, won't we?
