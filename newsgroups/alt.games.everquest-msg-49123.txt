This is patently false, as anyone with a bard over the age of 12 and a modicum

of curiousity can tell you.

Try, for example, singing carrilion to the RyGorr orcs.  You can hang out
with them, even talk to them (they aren't much on conversation, unfortunately)

and most importantly, stand there and wave to the Avengers that some idiot
spawned despite your telling him directly that killing the chief in arms reach

of the fort is a death sentance for both him and half the people camping
the fort.

Carrilion raises faction.  It is possible that you will find a mob to which
you are so low on faction that the raise is inadequate to make you no
longer KOS... although there are also items which improve your
effectiveness with the song, much as MMBattledrums improve selos'
speed.  As a rule, though, most KOS mobs will become at least
apprehensive.  Lots of zones have more than one faction, which
means that (for example) you can't wander with impunity in Kael
Drakkar, even though you can be non-KOS with any of the three
factions there... you'll still always have to worry about the other
two, at least until you gain "real" faction with them.  Of course if
you make yourself non-KOS to the See Invis giants, and then
cloud up, you can pretty much do as you please...

One exception I've seen would be certain Dark Elves.  Normally
even a fail with this song does nothing, its not considered an
attack.  However, on several occaisions, I've seen DE attack
on singing this at them... to name two, Dvinn (or whatever his
name is) in N Ro, and the DE lady tucked away in the back of
Ogguk.

What the song does, it seems, is temporarily change your
faction rating, whatever the faction your target is goes
up one or two levels, more or less (probably a set number
of faction points, determined by your skill and instrument)

I have no direct experience with the enchanter version of
this (Alliance?) but I'd be surprised if it didn't work the same
way.
