[Adam, your comments set up the following rant, but you may feel free
to take it as directed at the faceless mob of whiners it's aimed at.
Or if you prefer go ahead and take it personally, plonking or flaming
me as you see fit.  The choice is entirely yours.]

Last I checked EQ was not, nor was it EVER intended to be, a constant
action kiddie arcade game.

No, wait...

You're right.  TheDownTimeWhine[tm] has been coming from EQ spell
casters forever.  And it's been a total crock of shit for just as
long as it's been spouted by all you spoiled whiney brats.  Spell
casters in EQ are granted a special advantage over melee classes,
they get to take their "power" and spend it in concentrated chunks.
The downside to this tremendous advantage is that if they do this
repeatedly they have to wait to recharge.  And do you know what?
Using this enormous advantage casters are far more effective than
melee characters except in certain special circumstances.  Even
in mixed melee/caster groups, the most effective groups in almost
all circumstances are caster heavy.  But, is that good enough for
you all you mindless, gratify ME NOW, oh mommy I can't wait another
minute, self-centered punks?  Hell no!  You DEMAND that after you
eat your cake it still be in your hand.  How fucking mindlessly
selfish can you get?

To summarize, as a long-time (3-1/2 year) player of melee characters
who has recently given up the struggle and started playing casters,
I am flat out disgusted by the whining about downtime from players
of casting classes.  There is simply no excuse for the childish
selfishness you people have demonstrated over the last few years.
