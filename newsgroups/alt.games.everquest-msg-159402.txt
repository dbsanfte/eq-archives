Ok I have a question about a problem I had today.

Situation:

went to scarlet desert to camp the Burning Priest for the bane shield peice.
as soon as I zoned in i /ooc camp check.. no answer.. about 5 min later..
after killing stuff.. /ooc camp check again.. no answer.. went to spawn
point saw a guy killing sun guys.. asked if he was camping anything.. he
said just killing stuff.. ( he was the only one close the the spawn point)
so i /ooc that i was camping the burning priest that i hope he spawns.. like
2 ppl said in shout good luck and then another guy said in shout he spawned
the night before .. so i said in shout that there was a patch so maybe he
will spawn=)

well like 5 min later i got agrod.. was killing it.. had it about 5%
health.. looked and there was the BP.. so i dotted my agro and went to get
MY priest.. well got there and it was dead.. some fool killed it.. well i
said that I was camping it and that he didnt have right to kill it.. well
there was him and an alt.. i looted the amulet..

now is this right or wrong of me?

like i said i ooc'd and even shouted over and over again that i was taking
it.. if he had been there.. wouldnt he had said something?


if this is confusing let me know i will explain better=)

TIA
