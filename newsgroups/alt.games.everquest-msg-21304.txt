Correct.

Oops...should have stopped while you were ahead. :-)  If the EULA does
not hold, then you are pretty clearly the owner of that particular
copy of the software (since the EULA is the only thing that can
conceivably turn the transaction by which you acquired the software
into a licensing rather than a sale), and so you may use the software
as allowed by copyright law.  That includes running it on your
computer, making backup copies, and selling that copy (along with all
the backups).

However, in the case of Everquest, where the software is not very
useful without the additional purchase of an account from Sony, it is
perfectly legal for Sony to limit the sale of accounts to people who
have accepted the EULA for the Everquest software.
