Yet another unsolicited WoW review. Christ these people are worse than
Jehovah Witnesses.

Ahh, I know an inability to "gank" n00bs who level in the newbie zones
which are oddly enough are adjacent and occupy said "attacked town" is
every d00ds wet dream, which I guess WoW has helped you to realize.

Yes I guess those darned locked MoBs make a hell of a time for kill
stealing. As for missing shards, never been a problem for me. I avoid
sloppy players. Like the lazy sloppy sort who kill n00bs, err, "attack
cities" because they like their game play easy with few real threats
and no consequences much like their character deaths.

Now see, here is the problem. I actually enjoy the game. You seem to
suffer from a lack of willpower; a malformed sense of self. How can I
trust your opinion about WoW when you have demonstrated that you can
be brainwashed for 6 years? For all I know Blizzard got their hands on
you and plied that playdoe like brain of yours, turning you from a SOE
stooge to a Blizzard stooge.
