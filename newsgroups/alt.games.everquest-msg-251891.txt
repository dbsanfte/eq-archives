I don't know if crushbone belts/pads and kaladim bone chips count as quests
but they are 1) great lowbie xp 2) terrific faction boosts. I used to love
the key quest in CB for my iksar monks.

You mentioned OT faction is getting easier? In what way?

 I always thought that since the game lore changed to have the gods abandon
norrath (i assume that's why everyone seems to be killing their own chosen
deity) that cabilis could open up more to other races by simply adding a
faction hit to all cabilis residents on sarnaks or goblins. I don't see
iksar as evil, just survivors, and I think a lot of people have played them
that way. Few people see that city and it just seems a shame.

As for the OT hammer proc bit, doesn't it proc in duels or something?
