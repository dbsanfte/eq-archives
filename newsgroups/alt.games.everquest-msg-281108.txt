Ah, I just found that.  If you go to the individual class sections,
and follow the link for spells, you get a really crummy spell list
that (a) still has out of date spell levels and (b) has all sorts
of placeholders like "%z" instead of showing numerical values for
the effects and (c) doesn't include info about vendors.  I long ago
stashed a link for the old CR spell lists, just in case, but I've
stopped using even that since the discussions were mostly crap.

Their new spell database is fairly nice, though I think I still
prefer Alla's.  To get to it, you have to go to "Spells" under
"Game Info", and NOT to a class-specific area first.
