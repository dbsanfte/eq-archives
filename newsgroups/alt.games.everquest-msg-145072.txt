That's a seriously flawed editorial.  His facts don't support his
conclusion, and then he tangents off into a cry for more welfare and
socialized health care.  The fact remains that this nation was founded
mostly by Christians, along Christian principles.  Do you agree, or
disagree? (the proof is left as an exercise to the reader.... d'oh, wrong
subject).
