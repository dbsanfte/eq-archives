I wouldnt say plenty,and the level 62 fast heal does the job
too,especially with all the AAs mentioned here in this thread,
which are pretty off-topic.
And please do not assume,that I dont know when to use a fast
heal or a complete heal,I was using Complete heal to make it
obvious how laughable the mana cost is on PR.
