Don't bother.  Just kill Brother Z in Rathe Mountains.  We did it twice a
couple weeks ago.  It was a typical melee epic encounter  (the steamfont
girl for rogue epic comes immediately to mind as an example), 3 groups of
50+.   Monkly business probably has all the details but Hasten, drakes and
something else is his placeholder.  He wanders near the HG hill so we camped
out up there waiting for him, soloing hill giants and generally just having
a good time.  First spawn took about 2.5 hours, the second less than an
hour.

The Raster camp is too damned depressing.
