So are pathing exploits. Observing 'artifacts' of the game mechanics and 
using them in a sensible way is not a 'bad thing' per se... but its not 
a 'good thing' per se either.

No doubt.

An apt explanation of aggro kiting.

The difference is that the mob doesn't have a choice in the situations I 
described. if its feared it *must* run away. If its rooted and nobody is 
in range it *must* stand there.

Its not so much the 'absolute' that the mob isn't hitting someone, its 
the fact that it *could* be hitting someone and isn't.

If its chasing an unreachable ranger with 5 players at pointblank range 
whacking on it... it should probably think about doing something else.

And if the mob can be relied upon to chase targets it can't catch the 
game is already lame. (Or at least that part of it)

That's pretty much the tweak I'd envision. A mob that *clues in* that 
its doing zero damage with its current strategy, and it has ample 
targets of opportunity at point blank range to choose from.

Even if just a once per tick it turned and swung on something else it 
would at least be doing something relevant, and not 'wasting' its 
attacks.

Not quite. I observed that most xp groups are very low risk. I didn't 
agree that this was something I approved of or even liked. I infinitely 
prefer to be in groups that push things to the limit. I don't mind 
dying. I do mind falling asleep at the keyboard because nobody is ever 
dropping below 90%/90% health mana.
