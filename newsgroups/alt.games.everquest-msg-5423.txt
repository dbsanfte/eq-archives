<sigh>  I wish it really was your fault.  I had switch DSL providers 
last month. (no choice old one folded)  Now I'm stuck with Telocity.  
Since the switch, my connection has been junk.  PL is a problem not 
only for me but it screwing with my husband's work.  I'm only getting 
about 3/4 of the posts on this group.  My email server is finicky.  
Junk junk junk. :-(  And I'm stuck till my contract (with my old 
provider) is over.  Glad to hear your connection has improved, though.
