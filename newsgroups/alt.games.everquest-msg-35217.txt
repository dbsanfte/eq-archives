That anyone deserves to in essence be paid $640,000.00 USD for 8 days
of pain and suffering.

I am not saying the jury didn't award it to her just that I can't
fathom (or see how 12 people who couldn't get out of jury duty could
fathom ... ohhh wait thats it they weren't smart enough to get out of
jury duty that explains it) how anyone deserves to be paid what ends
up being the equivalent of a damn nice salary for 10 years (hell
64,000 a year is better than most teachers and doctors take home here
in the frozen north) for 8 days of laying down and having meals
brought to you.

Must be an American thing here in Canada the government woulda paid
the hospital and the Judge would have awarded a 24 pack of Molsons to
ease the pain.
