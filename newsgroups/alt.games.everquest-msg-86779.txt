I am currently 56 and have 0% towards AA. I *might* start shunting a
little of my exp towards AA after  I ding 57 (succor and natureskin
are more important than being able to sprint in a dungeon), but might
not start until 59 or 60.
I'd only start using AA at low levels if I had an overpowering need to
go on vox/naggy raids :)
