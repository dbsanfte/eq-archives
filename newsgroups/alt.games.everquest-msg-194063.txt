I don't doubt that *some* people have trouble with the 9700 Pro card, but I
seriously doubt that *everyone* with the 9700 Pro card is having trouble.
This is an extremely popular card, and many, many gamers are using the 9700
Pro.  So it's rather impossible to believe that every single Radeon Pro
owner is having problems.

But, as I stated before, I'd really appreciate hearing how it works for you
on your new system.
