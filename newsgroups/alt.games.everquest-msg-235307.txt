Here's what's left of the 3dfx website: http://www.3dfx.com
Not a whole lot there.  The most recent driver release for the Banshee 
was in 2000.  And that was a beta version.

Joolz has given you good advice.  The cheapest useful, but no longer 
great, video card now costs about $60.00 US on average.  Real good video 
cards currently start at around $130.00 US and up.  Were you to sell 
your system, in perfect working order, it /might/ bring $45.00 US.

If replacing your system isn't an option, look for .forsale newsgroups 
in your area on USENET.  Or ask around for your local version of 
swapmeets or trade fairs where regular folk get together and sell all 
the stuff they don't use anymore.  In that situation I'd suggest you 
look for a used Nvidia Geforce4 or Geforce2.
