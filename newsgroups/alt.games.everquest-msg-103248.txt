Prelogue:    The Chimp had being clearing out  Ry'Gorr courtyard trash and
passerby's as a group was pulling the inner building. The Ry'Gorr Smith and
green Centurion buddy aggro through the wall as he tiptoed around to check
the rear courtyard.  Sighing, the Chimp casts Dooming Darkness and Splurt on
the Smith and just run the Centurion straight out to the Gimp. Returning
after the Centurion's demise he finds a Monk whacking on the still crawling
Smith. Chimp tries to step out of the way but realises Smith still following
him so he runs to fort entrance. When Smith and Monk arrive at entrance he
runs back and sits next to Gimp, on the opposite side of fort entrance to
the Monk's group. Eventually the Smith still suffering from a Monk wedgie
valiantly make it to the sitting Chimp whereby Gimp rewards his perseverance
by dutifully kicking his head in.

Chimp /em "Shrugs"

Monk /em "Rude Gesture'

Chimp says "Silly Monks Happen"


**Fast forward ten minutes**

Location:    Ry'Gorr fort in Eastern Wastes. Bloody cold.

Chimp:    Full health, laying back on a deck chair medding (without lich)
and generally enjoying the bookless view, inbetween puzzling over how to
drink his frozen martini.

Gimp:    Idley playing knuckles....badly.

Chimp and Gimp watch with puzzled expression as Silly Monk runs past the
field of view trailing a large cloud of Ry'Gorr...... in the opposite
direction to his group no less.

Gimp:    "Err, Master....."

Chimp:    "Yes - rather unsubtle Eh?  I wonder whether Silly Monk perchance
realises that casters don't stare at their spellbooks all the time anymore?

Gimp:    "Maybe he was Ebayed.....*cough*.....Master?".

The Chimp eyes Gimp for signs of sarcasm but the Gimp had over-studiously
returned to his knuckles game. The sound of a Silly Monk taking a beating
worthy of a red head grabs Chimp's attention so he stands up and Feigns
Death fluidly. Silly Monk tries to feign on top of Chimp anyway but fails,
takes another beating before scampering off to his group for healing, still
wearing his own Ry'Gorr fan club.

Chimp stands up, brushes off the snow and is pleased to note a frozen
martini at least travels well despite its other more obvious inconveniences.

Gimp looks up from his knuckles game, surprised to still be in one piece and
eyes Chimp suspiciously before looking around nervously.

Silly Monk's entire group is of course wiped out in record time, trying to
run like headless chickens but not making more than a dozen steps in any
direction.

Silly Monks Ry'Gorr fan club look around well pleased. They peform a few
rude acts on some of the scantier clad female druid corpses before
meandering back off to the fort. Last to leave is none other than the
Ry'Gorr Chief himself.

The Chimp makes sure Nekkid Silly Monk and some of his group have returned
before theatrically looting the corpse of the now dead Ry'Gorr Cheif. He
then wait's for the first "ooc: 100pp for res" before doing his own ooc:
"Price Check on Ry'Gorr Mail Chest".

The Chimp grins very, very evilly.....
