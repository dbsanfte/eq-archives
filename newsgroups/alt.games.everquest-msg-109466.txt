And just like FoH did when they killed the Inquisitor, Triton come across
like spastic brats.  Or at least the folks who did up the web page do.
Congratulations on the kill.  You played the game well.  Now go tell Mommy
and Daddy.  I'm sure they will want to know that you are "FUCKING DONE WITH
IT ALL COCKSUCKERS AND NOW WE'RE GONNA FARM THIS BASTARD... "  They will be
so very proud of you . . .
