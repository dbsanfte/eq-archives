You have to balance content around a 75% slow:  As a result
the mobs hit for 4x as much as the damage a group can expect
to handle.  

2 direct results of high slow percentages that dramatically
effected my mage:

In any place worth XP'ing my pets haven't been able to offtank
an unslowed mob since PoP -   
My first try at offtanking a golem in PoV with WoX resulted in a dead
pet very quickly.  In GoD purifying plant I had a WoX with 
Kazad/9/Spiritual Vigor (I <3 Pet affinity) killed by an add in
about 5 seconds.

So, I lost one of my most valuable non-DPS roles in a group.

2.  DS's became nearly useless - with limited buff slots tanks often
didn't have room for them.

In Kunark, Velious and Luclin I fought things that hit for upwards of
150 and had a 33 pt DS.

In Pop I fought things that hit for 500-600 and had a 45pt DS.

In GoD I fought things that hit for 1300 and had a 45pt DS - the
the relative return damage has dropped like a stone.


If slows had capped out at 25%, then those GoD mobs would only have
had to hit for 450 - something that well geared people can do
without slows.
