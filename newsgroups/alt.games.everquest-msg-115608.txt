I think I may be allright in 52... I'm still finding blues in EW (god, how 
I wish I had realized earlier how incredibly easy quadding is there... just 
about everything there runs at the same speed when snared). I'm quite 
intrigued by the CoM thing. I would have assumed that Druids simply could 
*not* solo in Dungeons. What other dungeons are you soloing in, even if xp 
isn't fantastic?

I may give those a try also. Thanks!
