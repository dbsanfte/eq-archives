I have had some bad experiences with indifferent or overloaded guides,
but many who claim they "should have" gotten what they want did not
provide enough proof. With the game full of lame scammers (ok, not
really full, but the ones there are soooo high profile) the guides
cannot trust your word on anything.
Always 
/report
then
/petition mentioning the report and the problem. The more people that
will do this, the less we will see the CU service sucks messages. They
will still come, but more will be valid.
