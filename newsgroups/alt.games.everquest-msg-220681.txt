I actually had a parenthetical mention of issues with gsay in the 
initial draft but editted out as it muddied up the 'latter 2' phrase.

I agree. And those would bave been the aforementioend 'issues'.

It has its moments to be sure. But I don't care for group mates having 
chats with their guilds while in a group, or yakking with their friend 
in tells, etc.

But seeing as these people would just switch to an instant messenger or 
the telephone if the ingame options weren't there its pointless to 
complain about them.
