    Can you get anywhere close to them without them killing you?

    If so, go to the top of the Inn/rogue's guildhouse. At the top is a
merchant and a trainer. Ask the trainer, "Who is Stanos?" He'll give you his
story, and the response he wants ("I will take the job" comes to mind) will
be obvious from what he says. Saying that phrase to him will increase
Deeppockets faction. From there, spam him with the phrase until you're at
Ally.

    There's apparently an NPC in Qeynos Aqueducts who will do the same thing
for Circle of Unseen Hands faction.
