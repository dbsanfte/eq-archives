Ditch that slash.  It's ooogly.

}> Chat windows allow a player to use multiple windows for specific chat
}> tasks.  For example if you are on a guild raid you can have all your
}> say and guild text in one window and your raid and battle spam in
}> another.
}> You can create as many windows as you like but most players opt for two
}> or three as the screen gets too busy.

I'd insert some of @ndrew's explanation as to why having multiple windows 
is good here at the top, but it does need a comma after the word 
'example', and again after 'one window', and again after 'like'.

}A: Right click on the black bar of your main main chat window where it says
}"Main Chat".  The second option down on the list is "New chat window.  Left
}click on that to bring up your new chat window.  Your new chat window will
}appear over the top of the main chat window, and can be drug to another 
}location and re-sized if you wish. 

Drugs are bad, m'kay?  Dragged. 

}If you wish to change the transparency level of your
}new window, open up the menu for the new window by right clicking on its title
}bar, then hover the cursor above the first option, "Window"  This will show
}another drop down menu.  Hover the cursor over "Alpha", then select faded level
}by left clicking.  You will get a box to enter a value of 0 to 100.  0 will make
}the box, but not the text, completely transparent, 100 will make the box and
}completely opaque, and 50 will make it semi-transparent.  

I'd ditch this part, probably.  Or make it a separate question about 
transparency.

}In the same menu, you
}will see a filters option.  By selecting this, you can choose what sort 
}of text, including chat channels, you want to go into your new window.

I prefer @ndrew's version for this part, as it has a bit more detail:

}> In the new chat window right click and choose filters.  Another menu
}> opens which allows you to choose which types of messages go into the
}> new window.
}> You can continue customising these windows with the filters to split
}> the different types of chat between the windows.

Is 'customising' an Ozzy spelling?  Do Americans spell it 'customizing', 
or am I just asleep?  We should probably try to maintain regional 
consistency. :)
