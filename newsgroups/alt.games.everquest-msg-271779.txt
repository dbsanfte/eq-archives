So my latest hobby in AO is cramming on equipment in order to be able to 
use nano's of a significantly higher level than my own.

AO limits what gear you can equip and what nano's (spells) you can use, 
not by your level (there are exceptions) but by your skills and stats. 
Each time you level, you get some points you can spend to raise some of 
these, but its not enough to raise everything, and there are caps each 
level as to what your max is in each skill.

My Bureaucrat is a pet class, and among other things, I'm trying to keep 
the best possible pet up.  All my pet nanos require the same two skills, 
Matter Creation and Time and Space manipulation.

I started out just making sure the two skills were capped out each 
level, and buying the best nano I could within that limit.  But then I 
found myself with a pet a couple levels lower than myself, and short 
only a couple points in Matter Creation; I had looted a Pillow (usuable 
as a melee weapon in the left hand, very crappy as a weapon), though, 
which had a couple points of Matter Creation on it.  By putting away my 
guns and putting the pillow in hand, I was able to get a pet my own 
level up instead.

Of course in another level I'd be able to use that nano anyway, just by 
spending IP on the skill.

But now I had some cash available to buy implants; I got a full set of 
all the cheapest implants for my class, this raised a bunch of skills, 
including the two I was using for pets.  I could get a pet a couple 
levels higher than my own!

Hmm.  Turns out there are some generic nanos available, which can be 
used to raise just about every skill in the game.  By purchasing Matter 
Creation and Spacetime (name switch was confusing) I could push the pet 
level up even higher.

Then I got serious; I looked at specific implants, and found out that 
there were ones identical to the ones I'd already equipped, only higher 
QL, with higher boosts.  I could afford a couple of the QL 50 ones... 
but there's a problem.  Can't equip them, need a lot more Treatment and 
Intelligence.

Treatment is funny.  Using the Surgery Clinic, you get a 100 treatment 
boost.  And they sell, at the clothes vendor, items of clothing that 
raise your treatment skill.  Swapping in a Medic suit, using the clinic, 
I was able to raise my treatment skill up to just above the 242 I 
needed.  I was also able to buy nanos to boost my intelligence, but I 
was still short a couple points.  Looking at other professions, though, 
I found an implant with a few points of intelligence on it in place of 
something on my 'Crat based implant.  The implants aren't specific to a 
profession, so you can get most anything by looking around.

Medic suit on, Intelligence boosted, I used the clinic, then swapped the 
intelligence implant in, so I could finally swap out a QL10 implant 
boosting Matter Creation 6 points, for a QL 50 one that boosted it 20 
points!  Doing the same thing with a Time and Space slot (luckily also 
requiring  intelligence), I was now able to use a much better pet.

At level 27, I've got a level 37 pet, a huge improvement.

With more cash, I'll be able to swap out even more of those implants 
using the same procedure.  And since the boosts all apply to my current 
skills, I should be able to maintain the same sort of advantage; its not 
just a short term boost (I think.  Obviously at level 28 I don't have 
all the answers)
