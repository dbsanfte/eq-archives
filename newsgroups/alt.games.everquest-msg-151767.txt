It really depends a lot on which zone you are in, and what level Frogloks
you are going after.

No weapons, scroll in one hand, shield in off hand, no haste, I find that it
doesn't help any with that scroll in my hand.  (I do actually own a weapon
or two, and sometimes I even equip it.)  For level, see below, assume most
relevant skills are maxxed for my level.

I usually go with SPF 15.

Having upgraded to a GeForce4, I find that my SPF is a fraction,
fortunately, so I usually think of it as FPS.
