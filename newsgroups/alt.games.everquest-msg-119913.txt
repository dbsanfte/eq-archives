I've been having trouble lately.  I recently got the Everquest Trilogy.
When I try to to talk to NPC's I get their initial speech.  When I ask about
the statements in the brackets, nothing happens.  I've tried everything I
can think of.  Is anyone else having this problem?  Does anyone else know
how to fix this?  Thanks in advance.

Dave
