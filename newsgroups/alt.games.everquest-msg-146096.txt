If the plan is to leave EQ for a month of so, and then come back, it seems
to me that none of the above games are a good idea, since they are all like
EQ, in that you basically progress by leveling, and it takes a long time to
level up to high level.

Perhaps you should look for a good single player game?  I'd suggest
Neverwinter Nights.  The official campaign was quite a bit of fun, and there
are a huge number of third-party campaigns available for free download.
