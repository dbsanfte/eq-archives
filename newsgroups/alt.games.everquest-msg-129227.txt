OK, I'm stupid - took my level 20 barb warrior over to Freeport to do a
little exploring.  Wandered around Ro/Oasis of Marr a little, then decided
to go back to Halas.

Going thru Kithicor the first time - must have been daytime - didn't seem to
be a problem.  On the other hand, coming back thru has gotten me killed
twice.  Once more and it's back to level 19.  Last time thru, I ended up
with a collection of ghouls/zombies whacking away at me. At my last two bubs
of life, I just /q'd hoping to quit but not get killed - didn't work.
Forgot to do a loc, but I have a general idea where the corpse is.

Aside from waiting for daylight for the corpse run then the run to Highhold,
any other suggestions on getting the heck out of here?

I'd start over in Freeport and write the corpse off, but I'd loose all my
stuff.  Full banded, two combine long swords and some assorted cheap
jewelry - maybe 200pp of stuff.  Doesn't sound like much, but I worked hard
for all of it...

On karana, by the way.
