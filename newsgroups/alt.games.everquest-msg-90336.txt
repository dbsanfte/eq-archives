DAoC doesn't have corpses when you get killed.  When ya die, you can either
do /release and go back to your bind point or you can just stay dead on the
ground for a bit and hope a Healer type class comes along and rez you.  Yes
Healer type classes get a rez spell at Lvl 10.
But if you do a /release you can not be rez'ed at all, but you go to a
Healer (NPC) and get fixed up a bit (can cost a bit of money), and if you
wish to you can go back to your tombstone and target it and /pray.  By /pray
you can get part of the xp you lost.  But you don't have to do this cause
theres no body for you to loot, so everything you have stays on you.
Also if you die and /release and before getting your tombstone you die again
that first tombstone goes away, cause you're only allowed one tombstone at a
time.
