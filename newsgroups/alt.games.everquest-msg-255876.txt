Raiding is mostly drudge work farming mobs. Only the new and undone are
actually interesting and they tend to be downright hard to do. Xegony alone
is taking us forever, for some reason we just cannot intercept all the waves
and thus our clerics get eaten. Best we have done is get to the next to last
wave twice and we have tried her some 30 times. (30 x 1hr setup x 60 people
= ugh) If we where not tempted by time loot we would in no way bother.

The loot helps you group at a much higher level than normal. Soloing is
probably important to the druids and necros but probably not to others. Now
the sad part is that raiders tend to not be any more skilled than non
raiders and yet there loot is MUCH better. But if it wasnt this way then no
one would raid and half the population would have won eq and been done.

The actual problem is that the non raiders tend to fall so far behind in
loot quality that they cannot effectively group with the raiders. The best
way to fix this is to shuffle some raid loot from the raiders to the non
raiders. The only way to do this without pissing everyone off is to let the
raiders sell there old loot. Right now almost all of the good loot is no
drop so while it gets frequently replaced it never trickles down.
