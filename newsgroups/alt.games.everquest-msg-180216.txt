Well by saying ban.. I figured he was refering to some kind of ;ban
command...

I remember a short while back I deguilded somebody, so they kept spamming in
our raid channel.. was pretty annoying.. although most officers were doing
;kick (generally before he could spam anything else)

I changed the password in the end... but I wasn't really happy with that as
my only solution.. specially when 80 people have to change their auto join
lists cuz somebody wants to be an annoying spammer
