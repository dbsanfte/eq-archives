It's a *game*. Games are supposed to be *fun*.

I understand your point about atmosphere, but there comes a point where
running through a familiar zone becomes less atmospheric and more of a
time sink. Those who honestly prefer to take the "atmospheric" path are
still free to do so.

One point that I think you missed, is that at the times I often play the
servers are typically underpopulated. In the above instance I was in the
Overthere... and there was *nobody* else in the zone. Clerics do not solo
well, as a rule, and soloing in the OverThere in my low 30s was not
practical (believe me, I tried). Passing through the various zones listed,
most were either empty or nearly so.

The net result was that rather than spending half an hour playing the
game I spent half an hour trying to get from point A to point B, and both
I and the warrior who wanted me to group with him suffered for it.

I agree that in some ways the PoK books make things *too* convenient. Some
method whereby you are flagged to transport to a zone would be a good
compromise. But nostalgia aside... running that journey was epic, and in
some ways I like being able to boast that I made it, but it's not something
I want to *have* to do.

        ...Ronny
