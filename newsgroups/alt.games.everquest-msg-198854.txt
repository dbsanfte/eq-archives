No, a group that knows what it's doing can pull continuously without KEI.  I
was in plenty of such groups LONG before KEI existed.  If you're constantly
fighting with zero downtime, you can't do better (for the area you're in).
KEI enables soloing/makes soloing faster, but for a group it is not needed.
Especially when you have a clarity enabled chanter in the group.
