Maybe he wants to play with his higher level friends, having
just discovered the game. Maybe he used to play and has now
come back. Maybe he's in a rut, but likes his character and wants
to break a few levels easily. 

Maybe he just enjoys playing a holy knight who's dressed in shiny
silver armour and not patchwork.

Who can say? Who cares what his hurry is? It doesnt make him an idiot
if the satisfaction gained from the expenditure is greater than
having an extra xx$ sitting in his account would give him.

Ignoring the rules of the game and potentially devaluing others
achievements for them by doing so being *selfish* is an argument
I'd have much more truck with, but claiming idiocy for spending
money on something that makes our hypothetical rich-guys entertainment
a little more enjoyable in what is, for us all, an excercise in 
entertainment that we pay for doesnt seem stupid at all to me.

Thats not true. You'll never get into certain guilds as a casual
player, be able to do certain things, build the support networks
you need for certain stuff, etc. 

Now, I'm not saying I think thats
unfair, but  I am saying that the argument that everything is
available equally to all is a fallacy. It assumes in the real world
everyone has equal constraints and freedoms, other than in their
bank balance.  Obviously, this isnt the case.
