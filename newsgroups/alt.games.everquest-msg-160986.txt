I was the beneficiary of something very similar to that recently.

The first day of PoP, I noticed they were selling the spell
Brell's Mountainous Barrier (level 60 Paladin) in the PoK library
for 3p each.

That was rather shocking, since prior to PoP this used to be a
mob-drop only spell, and seldom sold for less than 3-5k, when it
was available at all (I bought mine for 3k a few months ago).

So I bought four copies from the vendor for a grand total of 16p and
put them on my Bazaar mule.  I set the price at 250p each, which I 
thought was a bit high under the circumstances, but a fair "carrying 
charge" for Paladins who weren't going to buy PoP but would like to 
pick up the spell for a lot less than it used to go for.  Plus I
was thinking the BMB on the vendor may have been a mistake and
a subsequent patch would soon make it a rare drop-only spell again.

One copy sold in 24 hours, then the others didn't move
for the next three days.  Hmm, word has gotten around, I thought.

I noticed that a couple other people were still trying to sell
copies for 2k+, obviously those were prices they had set before
PoP was released and they hadn't bothered to mark them down yet.

Then, as I was doing some Bazaar searches myself, I watched a
guy come up and buy all 3 of my remaining copies of the BMB spell,
for a total of 750p.  Cha-ching.

I wondered what in the heck he was going to do with *three*
copies, until I thought to do a Bazaar search for the spell
a few minutes later.  Yup, sure enough, the schmuck had
snapped up my copies so that he could turn around and put
them up for sale himself at 800p each, "undercutting" the
folks who still had it for sale at 2k+.

He thought he was being shrewd, "buying low and selling high",
not realizing he could buy an unlimited number in PoK for
4p a shot.  Good luck unloading them at 800p, guy...

As the old saying goes, a fool and his money were lucky to
have been together in the first place.
