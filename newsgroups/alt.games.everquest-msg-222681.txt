> Cash loot wise, it's pretty poor compared to the Hill Giants in Rathe.

I wasn't comparing the loot to anywhere else. The statement still
stands.

Most nights I go out there I can see more giants than I can shake a
drum at. There is no need to look for the next giant, chances are he
is queueing up to be next to get smacked down.

Believe it or not there are in fact more than two or three zones where
you can get loot. Everyone and his pet goes to Rathe Mountains for the
giants. Everytime I have been there the gaints have been camped out by
2 or more groups of level 50+ characters.

(Why am I arguing???) 
You are right, go to Rathe. Its great there. Leave the rest of the
world to me.
