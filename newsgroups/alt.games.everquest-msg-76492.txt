AH THANK GOD since you have to type it again EVERY TIME YOU ZONE, wish
they'd just let you have it as a default...

Hmm interesting but mostly I see this being put to bad use, yep you
guessed it, as in buff begging and other begging. My characters names
are often a bit difficult to spell for the slow witted/typist and I'm
often pretty far gone by the time I get the tell whereupon I can say
"oh sorry don't see you now."

Ahahah for the people confused by everyone saying "send tell" (which
always seems redundant to me..) ?

NICE. Kinda wondered why had to run to bazaar to bind self (or get
bound) when nexus so convenient.

ABOUT TIME, get real tired of /assist and having it target a bard
singing for the person.
