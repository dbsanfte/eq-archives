For those interested in the nitty gritty details:

A signed 32-bit two's complement number has a range of -2,147,483,648
(represented in memory as 0x80000000) to 2,147,483,647 (represented
in memory as 0x7FFFFFFF).

An unsigned 32-bit two's complement number has a range of 0
(represented in memory as 0x00000000) to 4,294,967,295 (represented
in memory as 0xFFFFFFFF).

Now, interestingly enough, the value -1, when stored in a signed
32-bit two's complement number, is represented in memory as
0xFFFFFFFF.

Faned may be right about the value being the result of a runaway loop.

Another theory, equally possible in my opinion, is that they used
either -1, or the maximum value a 32-bit two's complement unsigned
integer can hold, as a "magic value" to indicate some special
condition.
