I subscribe to the @Home cable modem network. Occasionally, the cable
modem itself will start going crazy (activity light nearly constant)
followed by loss of connection - not merely to EQ, but loss of total
network connection. I have to power cycle the modem and it comes back
just fine.

I have the cable modem attached to an SMC Barricade wireless
router/switch/firewall to which my 2 EQ PCs are also attached. This
equipment all utilizes hard connections. The wireless access is only
utilized by my non-EQ laptop which is not typically even booted up.

One other fact is that this has rarely ever happened when I was not
playing EQ. (When not playing EQ - once every 3 or 4 months, when
playing EQ - once a week, sometimes 2, 3 or 4 times during one
session)

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. I thought I had stunned the
mob only to notice the net bar disappearing. I got booted and
summarily beaten to a pulp. :(
