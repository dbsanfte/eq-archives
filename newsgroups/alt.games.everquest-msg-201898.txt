There are other possibilities, as well.

Two mobs, close to each other - chanter has Lull line (now that it's
working) to allow easy split pull.  If you want to have fun - Lull, Root,
Debuff, necro snares - and when root breaks, Charm and put it on the other
one.  :)  Send in necro pet on second one, snare, enjoy XP.  When charm
breaks, use necro pet to kill weakened ex-pet.

Necros get nice pet buffs, but a chanter can boost the pet's haste and AC
with spells that stack with the necro's - at least at your levels.  Haste
and the 'shadow-mist' line will make that necro's pet even more lethal than
before.

Remember that the enchanter 'choke' line of DoTs all stack with necro DoTs,
and that they reduce target ST and AC.  The ST isn't very important, but the
AC debuff can add five percent or so to your overall melee damage.  Don't
sneer, it adds up.
