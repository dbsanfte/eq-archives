A place that will make 51 fly by is HHK.  One of the upper floors has two
nobles and a wandering lady (don't remember her name).  All of this IIRC:

They have under 2K hit points and don't hit too hard (maybe 120ish,
sometimes with a kick thrown in for 50, backstab for 150 or so if they get
behind you).  You will see the xp bar move with every kill.  They can take
you to 54 or 55.  Faction hits are HHK guards, Dante McNab, and some people
in Freeport (not the guards at the main entrance, though).  Five or six
minute spawn on the nobles, longer on the wandering lady.  The "Dealers" in
the room do not assist (but I was never there long enough to get KoS, so I
don't know if they would never assist).  The guards were green and left me
alone.  Good luck getting the camp though.  Sometimes I would camp in the
room next door, log on and "listen" for a casting message for a few minutes
to see if anyone else was there.
