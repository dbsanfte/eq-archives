WoW
Are you ever arrogant. Only person in the world.
Asked 3 druids who said no. Oh my.
I hate. "Any one have a new sword for me ? Any one give me 10pp ! Give me
Sow please.
oh you have skin too. what about regen ? oh and any chance for a tp to and
from X.
What Noooo. Why you !@#!$%."

Other 3 druids were prolly ( Probably seems so so ostentatious /grin) afk .I
often forget afk flag. If you zoned in after druid put afk flag up you may
not have seen it and could only know if you sent tell and not talked in
say..

And no shammies to ask. Hmmm I wonder why you only found druids. Perhaps
lots of them ?
Maybe you couldn't spot the shammies. They were all anon and sick of being
pestered. Or busy fighting in a group.Shammies what losers...oh and necroes
and bards not finding my level 3 corpse and....

You acted like a beggar and were treated like one.
And then confirmed it by showing your bigotry.

I respond to OOC or AUC looking for sow/tp etc can donate. And for sow click
cancel on the trade. My rogue buys Sow potions. My enchanter trades clarity.
My shaman is rarely asked.
If I am in muddle about mode I have ported and chatted with folk for hours.
Usually free.

On the other hand. I refused to help a level 5 toon who wanted me to port
her to DL and get her other level 7 toon from FoB to DL so the 2 could trade
items. The player offered 2pp and was nice.
I just didn't feel like spending another hour online when I wanted to go to
bed.

Were the 3 you asked busy solving some guild ninja loot problem ? In tell
hell with 5 buyers sellers trying to close a deal. OOM from sowing for the
last half hour. Were you role-play polite asker number 78 ?

From your bigoted self cantered post I for one don't believe you asked 6
druids nicely for SoW.
In almost 3 years of playing and having played on 3 servers. (Soon to be 4.
Gotta try FV now that the 1 toon rule is being kept.) I have never been
refused a SoW.Late nite doing run the world quests when ooc or auc don't
work. A tell with a may I get a SoW please. I can donate. Has always worked.
Druids Shamen. No difference. The higher level the player the more often
trade gets cancelled.
