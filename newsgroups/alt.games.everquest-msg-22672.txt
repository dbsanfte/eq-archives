Keep the SK, replace ranger with druid. You get healer and tank, you
get fear kiting, you get ports. Also, they won't both have to start
from scratch, and it won't be too drastic a transition from ranger
(casting instead of melee, different gear, mostly the same spell lines
as a ranger but much more powerful) . It's also not quite the
necro/druid team and makes a good starting point for a group. I
partnered with a SK as recently as last night, was good fun and not
too bad exp for hell.
