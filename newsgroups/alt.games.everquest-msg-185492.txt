Ok - now that ive reaped a certain spot for so long and gotten soooooo
many LQ/MQ/HQ pelts - ill share the best spot I know of. The poachers
in Jaggedpine drop TONS of pelts (no ruined). Ive sold 100's of pelts
in the bazaar and have made quite a bit of money. All types drop too -
Cat/Wolf/Bear. You should be, however around level 40ish (the higher
the better). Xp is pretty decent too here. The spawn time is great
too, very fast. One of the best spots is infront of the long tent near
the river. Nothing wanders by here (naturally). Just stay back from
the river a little or you might aggro a Potemid (sp?). Id say a pelt
drops on every 2 or 3 kills - sometimes even better. Just dont ever
turn your back on a poacher, they have a nasty habit of backstabbing.
The named poachers are a little tougher especially Yranik.
