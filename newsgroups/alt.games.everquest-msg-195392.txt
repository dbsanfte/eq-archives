Who in hell has EVER had a fungi in their early career?

Are you trying to say that EQ should be balanced solely in terms
of uber guilder caster's melee twinks?  Do you have the tiniest
f***ing clue what's being discussed here James?  You are saying,
whether you care to admit it or not, that players who chose a
melee as their main are rightfully relegated to second-class
citizenship in EQ.  Some people call me an ass, but you've named
yourself as one here.  You have staked out a position as a tin-
plated, self-righteous, "I've got mine and to hell with you"
motherf***er.  Well then, f*** you and the horse you rode in on.
