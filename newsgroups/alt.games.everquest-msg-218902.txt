I think for a newbie two boxer this combo is less than ideal. With two
people playing the characters, I'd agree, though both are pathetic
healers, which might cause some problems. However for someone new to two
boxing I think a shaman on the second account would be a lot more
playable personally. Fear kiting requires a lot of coordination to keep
both characters on the mob's tail doing damage, and rangers only have
fear animal, which limits your choices at certain levels considerably as
well. Having the shaman on the second box is considerably easier, as the
shaman contributes a lot just slowing the mob, hasting the ranger, then
medding and healing (or canna dancing as the player gets better at
running two characters)

A druid is great up to 50 or so then there's a huge gap until 58 where
the druid heals are fairly pathetic, and there's no way for either
character to improve dps or mitigate mob dps.
