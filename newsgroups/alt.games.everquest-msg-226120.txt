Test is the same as every other server, you have to kill as many mobs,
prices from vendors are the same, the zones are the same. The only
differences are the accepted attitudes from people.

Having no GM support means there is more attention to your reputation
than anything else, if you make an ass of yourself, people will
remember.

Things which will mark you as an ass on test

Using shout
begging
asking for payments for buffs
whining that testbuff doesnt give you plat
whining that test server isnt real, no one gets to 65 or it sucks, or
no one is in PoTime.

- Using testbuff can semi mark you as annoying before you start, if
you testbuff, be sure to try and prove you're a good guy/girl.  So
many of the test buff people have been morons, and so, to be seen to
be different, you need to think of how you would react if you were
listening to someone else doing what you were doing to your home.
