Funny though how verant puts so much energy in trying to sell us PvP
with the theme servers. Non-PvP servers are filling to the brim yet we
have one more PvP server added. Click on the population box and watch
all those PvP servers move to the top of the list (smallest population
compared to other servers) except for deity server and I suspect that
will join all the other PvPs at the top of the list once the novelty
wares off or one team has a greater advantage and everybody else
becomes PK bait.

Given verant's next big one is PvP Planetside and the fact all other
coming online games are PvP; I am beginning to think that there is
some aspect to PvP from a business point of view I just don't get.
Everybody wants to sell you PvP, worse yet Verant who gave you the
non-PvP and can see that most of it's costumers prefer that spend all
their time coming up with theme PvP and future games that are PvP,
very odd.

Suddenly for me, the future looks less like a new MMOG and more like
NeverWinter Nights as my game of choice.
