Wow, thats quite a nerf, first I've heard of it.  I haven't yet heard 
anyone complaining that mages are overpowered, either, and there is even 
an AA specifically designed to improve reclaim.  Are they refunding the 
points spent on that, like they are the bard AA that are being nerfed?

Druids have mask of the howler or something that I think stacks with all 
the above.


 From a comment elsewhere in the thread, I wonder if they are matching 
reclaim energy's effect with its description, "gives back a percentage 
of mana required to cast that pet."  This is different from the way it 
works now, where it gives back mana based on the HP of the pet.  Will 
suck as far as pet canni goes, but would make the spell useful at all 
levels (well, if used as a free clicky anyway), where we often destroy a 
wounded pet rather than heal him up, and also frequently have to destroy 
a pet since we are zoning.

If thats the case, I can see the arguement; "we are changeing the spell 
so it works as intended."  But it certainly is painful to have a class 
defining ability yanked out from under me without so much as a by your 
leave.  What happened to the heads up posts they were making for a while 
there about upcoming changes?

I'm also glad I haven't yet made it up to 61 in order to get the suspend 
pet AA, which I was headed for precisely because it seemed I could use 
pet canni much more steadily if I didn't have to kill my real pet to do so.
