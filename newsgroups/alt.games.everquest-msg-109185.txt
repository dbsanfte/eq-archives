I've seen pickup groups happen in the places you might expect:
EC, Oasis, LoIO, etc. Even in those places finding a pickup
group isn't too reliable. Most Test players resort to soloing
unless they have friends there to level up with.

I chose a druid as my main on Test for obvious reasons. None
of my alts (all under 25) have done much grouping, either.
