Dan, this clears a LOT up.  I suspect that it's pretty common knowledge 
what Quillmane drops.  It may not be quite a sought after as the ring from 
the AC, but it's still a very, very well known drop from a well-known mob.

It's pretty much the same as a manaburn wizard coming along, seeing a raid 
killing Gorenaire, and dropping a 20k point nuke on Gore, then looting the 
gear and thanking the raid for the help.  Blatent KS'ing of an engaged mob 
is against the rules.  Epic or not, it's still KS'ing.
