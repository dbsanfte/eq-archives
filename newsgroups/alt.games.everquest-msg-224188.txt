    Because it's bad. In a game where reputation used to be the primary
limitation on griefing, reputation can now be discarded for a fee. In a game
where community was once important, now you have transient players. It's
great for people that always wanted to play with their friends on other
servers, but it's terrible for the game as a whole.
