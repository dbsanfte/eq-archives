OMG LOL on your post, wd.  I loved the rednecks joke.  =)

I don't know what the hell was wrong with me back when I posted that, but
after I cooled down, I realized I made far too big a deal outta all this.
"Winterstorm"'s no more manipulative than I am a billionaire.  She's just a
confused woman who met someone (me) whom she wanted in her life, but she
didn't know how to fit me into it without making that "ripple" she told me
she feared.  I made matters worse for her when I wanted to be a bit too
close for comfort, all the while knowing it was neither wise nor practical.
She got panicky and dodged me a lot because of it, and of course I acted
like an asshole with all I did in return, further encouraging her avoidance.

I fizzled a lot; my Specialization:Maturity was only 23.
