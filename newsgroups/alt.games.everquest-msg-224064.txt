That should ready "play on the same server as me"

That was the only way to do it, give up any existing character and move 
to a new server.  Then it was "if you will pay you can move, naked". 
Now its "if you will pay More you can move with gear."

Why?  Well, a character is an investment of time and emotion, its 
possible to have an attachment to one... in fact in most cases I'd say 
you're more attached to your first one than to any other, no matter how 
poorly you made his initial choices.

Scrapping characters and making new ones isn't everyone's cup of tea, 
and it encourages a "disposable" attitude towards your "toon".

Mind you I'm guilty as charged of this, I've run a wealth of characters 
and abandoned them all with little guilt.  I'm not a poster child for 
the No Character Left Behind organization.  But I'm at least aware of 
the existance of such a way of thinking.

AND your point about the $75 is valid, but its not a response to my 
point, which is that Yes, I'd be interested in moving at Some cost (say 
a dollar?) but there's a price thats too high ($75, for example.)

I also have to admit to being technically ignorant about this, but I 
can't for the life of me fathom what could possibly cost so much money 
to do a transfer.  Copy a data file from one machine to another, backups 
and all, then delete the original (or better, just flag it as 
transfered, so in case of disaster you can just change the flags back to 
fix the problem).  Assuming a live human has to issue every command, a 
matter of a couple minutes... but instead, take a half hour out and 
write code to automate the whole process completely since its something 
you expect to do thousands of times over.

Now charge a nominal fee, say $5, for it, and sit back and rake in the 
dough as people transfer back and forth from one server to another time 
and again!
