Twas not Legolas who appeared. It was Glorfindel. Glorfindels role in all in
just that, getting the bearer to Elrond. You might aswell have Arwen do
that. No real harm done I think.

That did seem a bit over the top. I never pictured Galadriel as a power
hungry, dominant and slightly nasty queen of everything (by her own
admission).

Not so, an arrow can be fired at point blank range. It's just not very
powerfull at that point. The energy stored in the arrow by the drawing of
the bowstring is released in the arc. An arrow doesn't fly straight, it goes
up slightly and then down. It's on the downward arc that an arrow picks up
the kinetic energy to pierce because the tip is the heaviest part, it is as
such drawn down into the target. Unlike a crossbow bolt, which is the same
weight alrough and just uses the bows energy.
