It depends..

If you are talking about educating people and letting them know that
being gay is not a horrendous sin, that homosexuals are just people
who live a different lifestyle, then I am all for that.  I have NO
problem with that at all..

However, if you are talking about the militany attitudes of the
homosexual community where the go after special rights and special
consideration, where their attitude is "You have to hire ME because I
am gay.  If you don't, you'll get a lawsuit so fast...."   If THAT is
what you are talking about, then I would have to say... NO.. I don't
think that is a good thing or a healthy thing..
