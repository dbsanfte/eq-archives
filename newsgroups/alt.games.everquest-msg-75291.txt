OK, at level 15 I was in a group in Unrest, 4 Paladins, 1 Warrior and 1
Druid - absolute slaughter.  Then in Lower Guk 4 Paladins and 1 Enchanter -
mobs were nearly dead before the puller turned around.  Then just the other
day I was in the Death Tower group of Lower Guk, myself (44 Pally), 49
warrior guildmate, and 39 bard.  Yep, that's it, and we held it too, as well
as pulled.  Sure it was only just, but we managed.

After a bit we got another 47 warrior, and 40 wizard, and a 40 druid.  Exp
was then flowing in thick and fast.  Then the bard left, we got a 40
Paladin.  Then the wizard and druid left, and we got two rogues (41 & 52),
then the 40 Paladin and two rogues left.  Then a 50 monk joined.  I left
next and up 'til then we were still bringing in massive exp with the two
warriors, monk and myself.

Before this when the bard and myself were trying to start the group (before
my guildmate showed up) we had odd people coming in and out, but none would
stay because there is this mentality that in Lower Guk if you don't have at
least a cleric and preferably also an enchanter then the group will fail.
Ironically the frenzy camp which had a cleric (this cleric & another were
ones that left ours to join Frenzy because they didn't want to fight in a
group without an enchanter) and an enchanter got wiped out, while the
'practically all tank & impossible dungeon group' totally cleared the whole
death tower from ass/sup to executioner, with only two deaths the whole time
(like over 6 hours), and making hell experience.  (there was a 53 cleric in
zone so we got 90% rezzes for the ones that died).

It just amazes me how many people are caught up in the mentality that
clerics are the be all and end all of a successful group, and how many
clerics refuse to group in dungeons unless there is an enchanter, or will
leave your group for one that does.  I am not saying everyone is like this
but there are certainly a lot that are.  I think too many people have relied
so much on clerics that they are unwilling to try a variation to fighting
and grouping, one that is not necessarily worse, but just requires a little
more strategy.

No I am not bitching about the cleric class, I am more than happy to group
with a cleric and I think they are great, and the most effective class for
keeping tanks in action, but if one is not around that isn't going to stop
me from fighting/grouping etc.  The problem seems to be player's attitude
towards clerics and thier unwillingness to adapt to the situation.
