I have
AMD 1ghz ABIT KT7 mobo
Sound blaster 512 PCI
GeForce 2 64 bit
Win 2000

I have no problems... a little quirky at times sound wise (lot better as
time has progressed but still a little buggy here and there)

Just make sure all yer drivers are up to date and you should be good with
Win2000 and EQ

main question I would consider if I was you is this: Do you play dos based
games? Only problem I have with Win2000 is half of my dos games (XCom for
example) don't play right on my computer. if you have olders dos games stick
with Win98... If you don't, or you can live without your Dos games... go
Win2000

just my opinion
