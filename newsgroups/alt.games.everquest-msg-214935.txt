Curious nothing. Good old fasioned logic. To prove a building has 
termites is easy: all you have to do is point at one. To prove it 
doesn't is much much harder; just because I couldn't find one doesn't 
mean they aren't there.

Similiarly, a single reference that justifies your claim is all thats 
required. Produce it. For me to 'prove' that your 'law' doesn't exist 
however is a colossally greater undertaking.

PS I never 'smeared' you. I simply don't see the point of another 
he-said she-said. Without an outside reference we are done.

Spare me the histrionics and just provide a reference.
