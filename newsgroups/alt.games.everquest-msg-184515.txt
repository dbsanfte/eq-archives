His defense is only 46.

It seems unlikely that he was going the damage shield route for long
after the newbie levels.

Given that his evocation is so high, I think he was being pled (after
the 20s or so) by an enchanter and someone else, quite possibly a
melee. The two plers were playing catch, crush, charm and release and
then the cleric nukes it dead.

Once they got high enough doing this, the cleric probably simply
grouped up with the enchanter and they went on a charm rampage in mid
tier planes.
