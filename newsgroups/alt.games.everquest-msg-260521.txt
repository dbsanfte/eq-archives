I haven't kept track lately, but when I left the game I was the envy of 
every Shaman on my server because I had the new slow, Balance of the Nihil. 
As I recall it was only 65%, but had a 1.5 second cast time and a built-in 
40% resistance debuff. Oh, and it lasted only 90 seconds. I used it on a few 
raids and got lots of oohs and ahhs, but generally found that I was still 
using my Turgur's in raid situations. But it sure was nice getting it off 
quickly in places like the tipt or vxed as a pre-slow (especially if you 
didn't have a chanter along), where things could get dicey very fast. What's 
the state of slowing these days?
