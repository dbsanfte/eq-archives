I was playing in Crushbone last night using a character that I hadn't
played in several weeks. I was used to grouping, so the first thing I
did was find a group. We had a decent group, 2 mages (including
myself) with different elementals, 2 tanks and a cleric.
Unfortunately, there were so many people in CB that night, that there
was almost nothing to kill. As soon as something spawned, 2 or more
groups were on it. I had never seen it so full, so I decided to solo
for the first time in this area. I figured now was the time, since any
thing I pulled wouldn't have 10 friends with him. It was great, cause
I was able to explore areas that I would almost never be able to go,
at least not alone. I even took out some legos and emmisaries while I
was at it, just to prove that I could. I never could before because
pulling one usually means pulling three, and I just can't handle that
many on my own. Anyway, I had so much fun, even though I didn't get
nearly as much exp as usual, that I'm kind of hoping it's that full
again tonight. Just so I can explore.
