I can't recall running up against any run of the mill mobs in any tier 1 
zone that have any slow mitigation.  There are random mobs (archaic I 
think) in PoI that are immune to slow.  You should avoid those.  
Unfortunately, they will be random as to where they are in PoI.  
Personally, I like PoN, it's easy for me to grab single mobs, or, worst 
case two, and I have no trouble at all soloing them.  When soloing I do 
the yard trash, Blood Ravens, Gnarled Treants, and whatever the spiders 
are called.  I can handle two of them simultaneously if need be, keeping 
one rooted off and rotting slowly, while concentrating on one being 
rooted and rotted more quickly.

The easiest mobs in general are in PoJ I believe, but, at your levels, 
you should be good to hit PoN or PoD as well.  PoI is problematical due 
to wanderers, and the respawn rate, you could probably do train central 
there at the GY, keeping in mind that you would have to zone every time a 
train came in.  PoD yard trash is about the same as PoN yard trash in 
difficulty, and in how hard they hit, up to 260 or so as I recall.  I 
have done PoN with me, a 61 Paladin, and an 57 SK, and we could go 
nonstop.

What level is your husbands shaman?  I started soloing PoN at level 57, 
and up to about level 60, I had to pull with my best debuff, then slow, 
or I was a bit too likely to get a resist on the slow.  Starting at 61 or 
so, I found that I could dispense with the debuff.  I don't have Pox yet, 
so I don't use disease DoTs, they are way too slow.  I use epic DoT + 
Bane of Nife for DoTs.  Have not run into problems with resists on either 
of those in PoN, PoI, or PoD.

If you can get the nightstalkers camp in PoN, it is probably the best 
reward for effort for you to duo there.  With harmony, you can single 
pull them, and I find them to be just as easy to solo as the regular yard 
trash mobs.
