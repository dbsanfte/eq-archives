Covered by laws.

Covered by laws.

Ok, so you grasp the concept of laws and the concept of a lack of laws...

And here is the flaw in your thinking.  Social mores do *NOT* equal laws. 
For an excellent example of why that is so, feel free to read up on
prohibition.

"Never mind that it's against the law"...  See, you still comprehend the
fact that there are laws in place to deal with things that infringe *beyond*
*a* *certain* *point* on the lives of others.  That is why laws exist.  It's
why prohibition went away, but you can still be arrested for driving drunk.

Working from that premise, tell me what "law" (EQ rules imposed by Sony are
sufficient definition for this exercise) cybering breaks.  Most cybering
that I've randomly encountered (and it's very rare to randomly encounter it)
is in much more polite language than what I see flowing through shout and OOC
constantly.
