I played up to level 20, without dieing once between 8th and 20th, so
I guess I don't have much experience with the death points, but I
understand that they fade with food, and food wasn't that expensive.
Though, limited experience with that may make me wrong. On the other
hand, the important point is that I didn't die once between 8th and
20th. I walked all over being chased by monsters much above my level,
and was always able to get away. (I also jumped off a 300ft high
bridge and didn't take a scratch.) I just didn't see the point, it was
supremely boring. I've had more fun in just one zone (Everfrost) in EQ
than I had in all the time I played Horizons. (And yes I gave many
different classes a try in Horizons; Scholar, Outfitter, Armorer,
Warrior, Cleric, and Scout. The crafting was boring too...)

I'm working on making my own opinion of a good online RPG using NWN
right now. So far, I think it'll be fun.
