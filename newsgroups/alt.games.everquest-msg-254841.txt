One thing to add as far as using your stuns for taunting purposes.  Taunt 
can fail, stun will cause increased hate, even if resisted, and it causes a 
far amount of hate to be built up.  A successful taunt will always put you 
at the top of the hate list, just barely, so, it is useful to use both.
