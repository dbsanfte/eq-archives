Very true, no argument there. However, while I don't know about your
preferences on the matter, I generally try to play the game based on
the cards I'm holding at the moment.



Oh, and for the record, I'm arguing with you because I really enjoy

tendency made me very popular with my philosophy instructor, but
decidedly less so with the other students.

Of course, you're still wrong :)
