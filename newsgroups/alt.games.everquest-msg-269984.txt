I'm normally against crossposting, but this has more relation to the lore
of Norrath than to any particular game.  I finally started jotting down
the webcomic I've been wanting to for a while.

I'm no Woody, Straha, or Yeroc...I have no experience with comics and
drawing large quantities of scenes, so don't expect a masterpiece. :) But
hopefully over time I'll get better.

Also...this is only loosely based on Norrath.  There will be conceptual
and cultural differences, and they will become more frequent as the story
develops. So I may eventually just go in and retrofit different names of
gods/races if I feel that the story diverges so far as to really not count
as EQ-related anymore. But we'll see where it goes.

Anyhoo!
