OK I'm at my wits end :)

Of late whenever I try and go trader mode in the bazaar (AB server btw)  the
EQ server boots me before too long. I get terrible lag spikes which I wasn't
expecting as I'm using ADSL and have been for a while. I used to be able to
leave my trader for days without problems but now I'm lucky for him to stay
up for an hour. I have not changed anything to what I did before. I also get
lag spikes in other zones and it strangely appears worse if my character is
not doing anything.

The knowledgebase at EQLive suggests it may be an IRQ share problem so I
checked. The USB/graphics and sound card ALL use the same IRQ. Now I havent
suddenly changed this and after some digging I realise I can't change them
without reinstalling the OS (Win 2k) due to my comp being set up as an ACPI
PC. I have very little else running alongside EQ - usually just ZoneAlarm. I
am reluctant to drop my firewall as I like the protection offered whilst
online.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks
