With this CHA debate going on plus the change to the 200 INT soft cap a
while back (though I'm not sure exactly what the change did), what should I
be looking for as I level up in Norrath? Currently I'm level 45 and with
Brilliance/Radiant Visage in effect I usually go into battle with something
like 180-195int 165-180cha depending on what mood I'm in. Today, I'm in Solb
with 193int 167cha - is it worth pursuing higher cha or just getting the int
up? I'm having no problems mezzing so far, never charm and rarely fear. Also
if the 200 soft cap is gone, should I get an SMR as my next Robe or shoot
for 200+ int and get a FBCR instead with the 40 mana it gives - thoughts of
the highbies appreciated :o)
