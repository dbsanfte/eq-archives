Jump from the EW side at the middle. (Look down first to make sure
you're over water.) It's a rush. Even better, if you are a levitate type
class, get your wings on and run off the top of the bridge at an angle
heading towards the Ulthork hunting area. It's like Norathian hang
gliding. I actually used to look forward to the run back from IC after I
went to sell when I was quadding there. I could make it all the way to
the dorf cottage on the shore before my feet hit the ground. The view is
pretty spectacular.

For the original poster, not sure of your level, but if you are 46+ have
a wizard take you to Plane of Sky and jump off the first island while in
3rd person view. That's a pretty cool one too.
