Aha! I think I've figured out why some people have green X's.
There's a file called defaults.ini that's part of the download;
it has default values for many settings in UI_char_server.ini.
I just checked mine and it has

GroupColor.red=0
GroupColor.green=250
GroupColor.blue=0

in the MapViewWnd section.

I'm betting that what happened is, when they first added the X's
they were simply always blue.  Then someone decided to make it
possible to change the color, so they added the parameters and
put in a default of black.  This generated some uproar, so they
changed the default to green.  But those of us who happened to
restart our clients while the default was black, got the black
settings copied over to the UI files for individual characters.
When the defaults.ini changed to make the X's green, characters
who already had settings copied into the individual UI files did
not pick up the new values.  Meanwhile, people like my wife who
don't play every day, managed to miss the interval when the
default was black, so the next time she played she picked up the
green setting.

I do wish they'd have mentioned the new settings in an update
message, though I guess they try to avoid telling people to edit
the UI files since it's easy to screw it up to the point where you
can't play at all.  I wonder if they're planning to add a UI for
changing the X color from within the game?
