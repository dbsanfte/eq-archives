Most likely the first debuff (whether it be the Darkness line which
affects movement speed or whatever) will take hold and any further
DoTs will only "stick" the damage component or overwrite the earlier
DoT if it is a bigger debuff (ie: Devouring will overwrite Cascading
Darkness no matter who casts it.)
