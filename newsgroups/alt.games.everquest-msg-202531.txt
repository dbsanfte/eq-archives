If you spend any amount of time in groups, the fact that a group of 6
just got their exp increased by half anywhere outside of PoP is gonna
matter a helluva lot more than the KEI nerf. Only now the casters are
irrelevant in those groups again, in a world where 10/24 weapons can
be bought for under 200p, and a suit of Crusty or Rygor armor costs
about the same, melees rule again at lower lvls.

Those that lvled before KEI managed to pull pretty much non-stop in
groups, and we did it with much shittier gear (in the snow, uphill
both ways! <g>). You can make the downtime arguement for soloers or
maybe 2 or 3 person groups but not anything above that. At any level,
the only time a good group will have downtime is if they just survived
some overpull or a mob that was overpowered for their level. A few
minutes of downtime after that kind of a fight isn't a bad thing IMO,
gives you a chance to discuss what you did right and wrong during that
fight.
