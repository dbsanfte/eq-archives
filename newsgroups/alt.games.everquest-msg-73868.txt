No, its science fiction and even if it wasn't it would have nothing to
do with 1024 meg of ram.

You CAN designate some of your ram as ram to help you video card
IF you have a PCI 3d card. You still need a 3d card since it has to
use direct 3d and more specifically direct x 8.1. (or 8.0 or
something)

Specifically under advanced (on the display screen) there is an area
which says "direct 3d" for your video card (at least with nvidia
drivers) which says how much texture memory you can choose to use
system ram for. This is only if you have a pci video card though or an
agp card running in PCI mode. If you have just a regular AGP card not
in pci mode, this setting will do nothing. I have it set down to the
lowest ram amount possible (2 meg) just in case it might be trying to
reserve that memory though.

The thing is, this will really make no difference in EQ anyway since
guess what? Yep thats right, your system ram in running EQ is used for
the textures ANYWAY. This is why if you can monitor with cacheman or
some such program you see that your system memory use is FAR less when
switching from HIGH textures to LOW textures. 

The advantage of a 64 meg video card like the Geforce 2 or above is
that its taking some of the load off of your memory just as its taking
more of the load off of the CPU. So you should still get a Geforce 2
or 3 as an upgrade for you computer, it should still have 64 meg of
ram and you should still probably have around 512 meg of ram in your
system. 512 meg of system ram and a geforce 3 (or even 2) 64 meg video
card is better than having 1024 megs of ram or 768 meg of ram and a 16
meg video card (or even possibly a 32 meg one)

For example, currently I have a tnt 16 meg agp 2 x card and 585 meg or
so of ram. I run EQ with all models on, social animations on, texture
quality low, and conservative swap usage on. I have vcache limited to
24 meg to have as much free memory for EQ as possible, and I see that
at my WORST use during EQ I only used 540 meg of 575 meg of ram and
the virtual swap stays at like 60 meg of use.

So as you can see, at this point I'd be better off to get a geforce 2
than another 256 meg dimm (making me 768 ram basically since I'd toss
out the 64 meg one I have in now) since with my configuration I'm
really not using all the ram anyway sort of.
