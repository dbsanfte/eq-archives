: "Most"?  It cripples the in-game economy, true, but that hardly
: makes it "root of most problems in the game".

It's also a big problem with lower level characters getting hand-me-downs
that they would never normally be able to get.  That's an issue well beyond
just the in-game economy.  This could have been handled with minimum level
requirements (that they obviously are able to implement).  It may not be the
"root", but I believe it to be a core issue to many of the problems in the
low-to-mid level game.
