There are a few no-drop tags.  Just not that many.    

    One day on FV, I was in Paineel, cheerfully slaughtering guards with
my at the time 25th or so cleric.  I was medding up for the next round,
when a female member of one of our 55+ guilds ran past me and dropped
dead.  I have no idea how she came into this situation, I just know that
I was mighty startled when I heard her death cry, thinking that maybe my
fate had caught up with me.  I was even more startled when I realized
she was in one of the server's top two guilds.  On a lark, I offered my
puny little rez (35% IIRC), knowing full well that she could do better. 
Naturally, she politely declined.
   A little while later, a high level cleric from the same guild ran up
to me and inspected me.  She asked if I was meleeing the undead guards. 
When I told her I was, she handed me a summoned hammer, and told me to
keep being nice to strangers.  I don't remember if it was a Hammer of
Judgment, but I do know that this happened after that patch.  Anyways,
it was wildly better than what I was using at the time, I think, but am
not sure, that it did extra damage against the undead.  It tried to
proc, but I kept getting the messages about my weak will.  Hope this
helps.

Annie <--- Misses that hammer, whatever it was.
