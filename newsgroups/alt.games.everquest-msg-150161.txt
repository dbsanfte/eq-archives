Cash and gems usually go to the vault to pay for peridot and so forth.

Exp, on the other hand... well if its one mob, you are correct, its
not much exp proportional to the time you generally waste getting
there and set up and so forth.  But in a raid where you are clearing
vast quantities of high level mobs to get to the spot where you will
kill the boss, theres a lot of exp.  One group tends to get it all,
even though it consists of the exp from three or four groups
working flat out to kill as many mobs as they can as quickly as
possible.  If you've been in  the KS group on this sort of raid, you'll
know it isn't actually a "miniscule amount of exp", in fact only
a good AE group yeilds more exp per hour in some cases.

Me too.  I've always been annoyed by the lack of an exp sharing
mechanism, with many targets clearly designed to be unkillable
by a single group, yet not dropping anywhere near enough loot
to go around, most people on most raids will get no direct reward
for their time at all.  Points systems major arguement in their
favor is that they give at least SOME direct benefit to raid
participants...
personally I hate points systems, but can't seem to find a high
level guild on my server not using one.  Therefore I go on a lot
of non-guild raids, and of course there you don't even have the
indirect benefit of "helping guildmates get better gear means they
are more powerful and better able to help you get gear for yourself
later"

Splitting out the exp would mean that if you keep raids tight (not
massive overkill, just enough to do the job well) perhaps I won't
be sitting around thinking "I could be in an exp group instead of
wasting my time here like this"
