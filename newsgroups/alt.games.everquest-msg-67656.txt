We Uninstalled Luclin because we were going to wait for the new puters to
come right?  Ok, so I'm running around GFay after the uninstall and what to
my wondering eyes should appear?  A Vah Shir....

So I thought, Hmmmm....  odd.....  but didn't worry about it too much...

Ported to NK and got my bind at Gypsies.  Did a tell looking to buy a SoW
pot, no problem, found a Shaman with one dose to sell...  he was at Wizzy
Spires.  I ran there and bought potion.  We finish the deal and I turn
around to see a Vah Shir and it's Warder or whatever it is called.  Took a
screenshot and the screen froze.  Didn't realize what had actually
happened...

Restarted the puter.  My character is now in the Nexus.  I don't have Luclin
Installed!  WTF???  LOL

Can I reinstall Luclin and hope she'll still be there or do I contact
someone else.  I did not have a shard for porting or anything else.  Wasn't
worried about being caught in the port to Luclin since we didn't have it
installed.

Sigh....  Now my poor Cory is lost somewhere on the nonexistant moon.  Any
ideas?
