I think it is the cause; and I think it gives that message so that if
an instance ends while people are en route they won't be barred
entrance, which means more people can have adventures than your
solution.

I'm sure they knew exactly how popular it will be for the most part,
and are just waiting out the inevitable splurge that happens early on.
LDoN does not have the depth the other expansions do; many people who
had it right from the start or in beta are already drifting back to
PoP and doing much less LDoN than before.
