Yes I am.  Both actions are prompted by the same
motivation to help people who need help but
are not in a position to help themselves.
You asked why someone would do it.  I told you why.

It's not about helping "Verant".  It's about helping
the players.

But given the money-grubbing focus of your
original "That's $0.25 an hour? Who the fuck would 
work for that?" question, I'm not surprised that
you didn't really understand the answer.

Not everyone does things just for the money it
can bring them.
