Is this where I'm supposed to sacrifice all credibility and say "but i 
have a sex crazed supermodel wife, genius kids, etc =)

Seriously though, I haven't worked for a corporation since I worked fast 
food flipping burgers to pay my way through university. I work from home 
as a contractor, as well as have a partner share in a couple independant 
business ventures. As far as employees... I have 0. I do however 
routinely subcontract work out. I do have bosses and deadlines... but 
they are negotiated in advance, and the terms are always mutually 
agreeable. And since we seem to be measuring success by vehicles... I 
own a VW Golf and a 911.

You've never met a dentist, doctor, lawyer, architect, mechanic? Many of 
these are highly successful 2-6 person operations.

or ...how about a consultant or contractor?

Marketing consultant, FDA regulatory consultant, Financial Planner...the 
list is endless.

All require fairly specialized knowledge / education. Luck and talent 
help but are not critical.

Many businesses hit a critical mass around 6. A dentist needs a 
receptionist and a nurse, and maybe will partner with another dentist to 
share the cost of said receptionist and nurse.

The FDA consultant I've worked with is a one man show, and is doing 
/very/ well.

Corporations are pyramids. Only a select few are ever at the top, and 
only a select few ever get near the top. Most people who start at the 
bottom of a corp like Microsoft or Ford or MacDonalds end pretty near 
the bottom of the corp too. Call that success if you like.
