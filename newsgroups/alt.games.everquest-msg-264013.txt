Only times I've felt like doing that was when one or more of the group 
members really did suck.  In one case it was an SK that seemed to be 
unable to generate agro, in others it was enchanters that couldn't mez, 
or healers that wouldn't heal.  Personally, I do pickup groups as a very 
last resort, if I can't get a guild group, and I really don't feel like 
soloing.

Seriously, I have never once had a noticable issue with having an SK vs a 
Paladin for the MA, unless it meant that we had an ability missing 
completely from the group, such as stunning/mezzing with CHing mobs, or 
snaring.  I generally group with other guild members, and the equipment 
level is fairly comparable across the classes, so I do have a basis to go 
on here.
