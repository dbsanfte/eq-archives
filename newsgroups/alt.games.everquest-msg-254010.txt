That is something I've noticed over the years of playing EQ and reading 
the many online guides. I think these guides are always written by 
someone who has a lucky streak with drops one night and get so excited 
by their new found source of wealth that they write up a guide which has 
nothing to do with reality since they are describing mostly one time 
statistical blips.
