Hahah, yeah, I am. :)  When I discovered the animations in beta I went
bonkers...my post on the boards was full of !!!s and bold face type and
lots of smiley faces.  Foxeye finally fights the way she was meant to
fight.

You didn't mention the taunt with it as well..that's my favorite, even
over the kick.  I wish I coudl get her high enough level to get other
abilities so I know what they look like, but I'm concentrating on my
cleric at themoment.
