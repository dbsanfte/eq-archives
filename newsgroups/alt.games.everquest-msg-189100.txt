What do you mean by 'seriously'?

Do you think PNAC are serious?

I take it you have read "Rebuilding America's
Defenses put out by this think tank.

It says U.S. forces will be required to perform
"constabulary duties" and says that such actions
"demand American political leadership rather than
that of the United Nations." 

They sound fairly serious to me.

You can justify any action by this sort of fuzzy
logic;

"Its not our fault... they made us bomb them"

The US have not been backed into a corner where
they had no other course of action. 

They had plenty of choices, and they took the one
that suited them, (a decision which I believe was
the correct one).
