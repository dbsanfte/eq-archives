I too enjoy having the boats, though I admit I wish they'd leave the
gnomes up as well so people would have a choice whether to enjoy the
ride or just bamf to the other end.

Anyway, SOME boats are back.  The boats to/from OOT are back (and those
gnomes are gone), as well as the boat that runs the length of OOT.
The boat to/from Abysmal Sea was back for a while but seems to be gone
again at the moment.  There are apparently boats in the Buried Sea zones
but I've never been there so don't know.  (Correction: Went there last
night because a guildie was going to lead a group of us through a quick
hail-some-mobs task, but it turned out I can't even take the task at 67.
There's a *reason* I haven't bothered visiting any Buried Sea zones...)

The friend who got me started on EQ has always said I should ride the
icebreaker boat to Iceclad sometime, just to see it.  Alas, the boat has
never existed in the game for me (I started during LDON, but don't recall
when I first visited Iceclad.)  I went back to check recently and it's
still missing.  I hope it comes back some day.
