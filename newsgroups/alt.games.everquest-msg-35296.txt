Everytime I run to a city gate from the newbie zone around it, I loot every
rat, snake, and belly-up critter I see. I almost always pull a plat worth of
crap from the bodies and it only takes about 60 secs to do it. The key is to
have open slots in bags. I love my bearskin potion bags I made by paying
attention to Lokari's tailoring guide. They are perfect for holding food,
water, and rat ears.
