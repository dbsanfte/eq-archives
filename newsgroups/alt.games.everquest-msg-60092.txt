It's a bug that popped up *months* ago (spring, I think?) and Verant
acknowledged it. They also said they "fixed" it in a follow-on patch,
and the problem seemed to go away. But for some reason, it keeps
cropping up again. And usually shortly after a patch. I haven't seen
anything on the VI developer boards on it for a while, but I've talked
to monks who've still been having the problem on and off. There was talk
that camping out and then back in would "reset" something for a while,
maybe catch the client up with the server... not sure. But I can't say
that's a definite fix. Mostly you have to just grit your teeth, wait a
few seconds, and try again.
