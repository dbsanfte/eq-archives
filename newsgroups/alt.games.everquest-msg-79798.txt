There is no right or wrong way to do it. Just balance what
you get for leveling and what you get for the AA skills and
see if its worth it to you.

Personally I am going for all my AA as soon as possible.
I want them because once you have them you don't lose them.
The exp lost from when you die comes from the leveling pool
not the AA pool. So they are basically locked in.

Also the range of mobs that give exp is much larger when you are
51 than when you are 60, and there are a lot more places to hunt at
51 than there is a 60. Also the mobs will need to fight will be
much tougher at 60.
