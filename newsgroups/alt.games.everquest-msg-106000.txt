The trick is to be close enough to the mob to see the HP meter
acurately, and still stay far enough away to react if root breaks.

Make sure the mob is snared as well as rooted (you need to have
SoW/Wolfform of course). Sit/med close enough to the mob that you can
see the HP meter drop when the DoT ticks off some damage. Keep your
finger on the Stand button, and be ready to jump up and run when root
breaks. 

The only mobs this is a problem with are Giants. They have a long
reach, and you usually have to sit too far away to get a good HP read.
Take notes on how many times you have to cast your DoTs on average and
use that as a rough guide when Root/DoT'ing.

When I played my Druid I liked to finish off with a final DoT rather
than a DD. I liked to get in as much med time as possible between
pulls.
