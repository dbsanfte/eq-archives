Nope, it wasn't meant to speed things up, if I recall correctly.  It was
meant to clean up the mess that was caused by the location and mechanics of
the final mob.

Speaking of the Cleric epic, the senior Cleric in my guild just got his, in
a somewhat amusing way.  During one of the long boring waits, he was passing
the time dueling with a Wizard from the guild.  The Wizard won, and as soon
as the Cleric died, Ragefire spawned.
