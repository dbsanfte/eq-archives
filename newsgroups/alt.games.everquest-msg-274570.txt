A bit of important detail was snipped...

From the OP:

"This guild was described as an adult guild when I joined.  There is 
constant sexual innuendo chat which no one seems to mind.  But she tosses 
me for saying 'bastard'...It's her guild and she makes the rules, but 
c'mon...bastard???"

Had the guild been represented as a family guild to begin with, and were 
the sexual innuendo also silenced, then this would have been reasonable.  
As it stands, at least from the description of events, it was not 
reasonable, and the OP is better off for no longer being in that 
particular guild.
