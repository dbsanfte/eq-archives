After playing a druid up to 21st level I have just about had it
with sow requests. When soloing in loio or NK in the late teens
you tend to go oom quite a bit and that last bit of mana may
be the difference between making a kill or running to the guards
or zone line. Then you gotta spend 10 minutes medding to be able
to try it again. This is especially true at 19 when you get your
new nukes that take up a lot more mana. What irks me is that
everyone EXPECTS you to sow them whenever they want it. People
say it comes with being a druid and I understand that but I've
played 3 other characters and I've never begged for a sow or just
rush up to someone and say SOW PLZ. Ive always paid from 3 to 5
plat for sows and breezes when I thought they would help. Now
consider getting in a fast chain pulling group as the healer. I
now have to buff, heal and maybe toss a nuke in occasionally when
things get bad. Now Im spending all my time medding up to where
I can toss another heal in the MA's general direction. In areas
where fast chain pulling groups tend to gather *cough*loio*cough 
and OT there invariably comes all the tells from nearby groups
wanting me to sow them as well. Do they think im made out of pure
mana?? Heres how ive decided to deal with it for now.

In a group - low mana:  i just reply "no Mana" if pestered i ignore

In a group - spare mana:  i'll be happy to help if they are polite

soloing:  i set /afk on dont send me tells asking for sow unless
you plan on compensating me for my time

then again, when bored and medding in crowded areas i often fully
buff wizards and necros for the hell of it. (cause I sympathize
with their plight of being outcasts)

NO, sow isnt NECESSARY for a corpse run. Ive done way too many
without it myself.
