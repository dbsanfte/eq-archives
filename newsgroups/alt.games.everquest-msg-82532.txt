As you should.

Because, for all your pretense at naivetï¿½, your original question is
motivated by a wish for suppression.

If other languages annoy you for whatever reason (or as you put it, make you
pissed at yourself), start a moderated group and be the language police as
much as you want. Otherwise Usenet groups like this one have no language
rules, even if the topic were Everquest in English (which it is not, by the
way).
