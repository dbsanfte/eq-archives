He had a history of mental problems, according to the story, that his
mother was aware of. Based on the description he required some form of
supervision. He comes off "as a child", because of the fact that he
was not able to take proper care of himself.

Age does not make one an adult. Someone with diminished mental
capacity or cronic mental health problems, will require care and
supervision their entire lives.

This was not a story about the addiction of an adult, though the
writer (and lawyer)  tries to pass it off as one.
