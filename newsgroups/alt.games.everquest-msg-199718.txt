I actually tried to start a new thread, because, you will see, I'm 
through with that subject. I will say that your not having "been there" 
also by definition invalidates *your* opinion according to those you 
support. Therefore, how are you any less wrong for piping up here than 
you claim me to be?

People jumping in just to say, "Yeah. So there" naturally are inviting a 
response and therefore forfeit any right to criticize anyone for 
providing one. 

No favor was needed from you. As I said, the issue was dead where I was 
concerned. You obviously just saw an opportunity to boost your own 
perceived credibility by piling on.
