Be careful not to "force" someone to play a specific class. This can
lead to burnout and resentment. If the guy "loves" playing a Bard more
than a Monk, you should let him play the Bard. No point in having a
perfectly balanced group if one or more of the members is not happy.
It will eat away at moral and eventually break up the group. Happens
to rock bands all the time :-).
