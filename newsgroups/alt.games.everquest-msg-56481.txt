Yes the thing about Archaean it isn't MMORPG, its MOW Massive Online World,
it should and hopefully will be different from other games. Perhaps someone
with more money and resources will beat Archaean to the punch (perhaps,
perhaps not.) but it doesn't matter.

The Dev Team for Archaean is really dedicated and are nice people. They
participate in the messageboards about as much as the players do, they
explain their theories and ideas to us, the players (well would be players
=).

Yes everyone know the site is light on content but the pictures, and what
not I have seem look great.

The real action is in the messageboards where you can ask any question you
want, post your feelings and people normally won't flame a new person...(I
have yet to see it happen unless they were attacking the game and being
extremely rude.)

The ideas and stuff that Arcane Development has seems wonderful and I think
they may actually pull it off just in time, always in time.

You have to search the messageboards to really get a feel for what the game
is going to be like...magic, death, all of that shall be a uniuqe part of
the game.

Again I like to sress that they are trying to make a Massine Online WORLD
(world being key a world like simulations, classes and leveless I believe it
shall be. Free to pursue your own wishes and dreams. Yes it is in the very
early stages of dev but still I like to have an impact on a game before
things are set in stone =) its a good feeling.
