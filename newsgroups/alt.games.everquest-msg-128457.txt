hey actually, if it makes you feel any better, i've shared your suspicion
too . . .

its just an illusion - enhanced by using certain sets of colors for your
attacks and your damage taken


doing all these math things won't make you feel any better

BUT

take your melee toon over to some noob area and land tons and tons of
attacks on some greens, generating that wonderful "You crush Fippy Darkpaw
for 32 points of damage." spam, receiving no dmg in return . .. THAT will
make you feel better
