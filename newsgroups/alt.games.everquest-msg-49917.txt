Hail, all!

My level 10 Ogre warrior (agnostic) has been systematically turning in
lizard meat and tails to the warrior guild in Oggok.

Each time I turn in four tails and/or meat to the appropriate npc (Kogna for
the meat, Horgus for the tails), I get the message "Your standing with Clurg
just got better. Your standing with the Craknek Warriors just got better.
Your standing with the Greenbloods just got worse."

However, the guild trainers now /con 'amiably' instead of 'warmly' as they
used to...  Am I losing faction instead of gaining?

If I've lost faction, any ideas how can I fix it, please?

Regards,


Another clueless lowbie
