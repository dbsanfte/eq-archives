I've got a wonderful book I found at the bookstore.  It's a very
technical look at the phone system, written by AT&T before the
breakup.  It was the book they gave new engineers to teach them all
about the phone system.

It has a little section where they talk about the evolution of memory
technology for the computers that run the phone switches.  The first
they show is a memory card from, I think (book is at work...can't
check to be sure) the very early 60's or late 50's.  Capacity was
something like a megabit.  Size?  About 3 feet tall, and something
like *50 feet* long.
