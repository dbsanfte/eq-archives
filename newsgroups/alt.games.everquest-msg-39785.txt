Why not? Those people did earn the equipment or the money to buy it at
some point. They just don't feel like doing it all over again... And it
doesn't put you at any disadvantage whatsover, the mobs haven't been
adjusted to account for twinking, and neither will they be, so there is
no way it affects you at all.

reason.
