I don't see how $40US is "not appealing"... or is it having to level up
from level 1?  Oh and how do I come up with $40US.. $20 for omens which
when I bought my copy included the handy dandy Yellow Buddy key for
platinum and $20 for DoN.. Boom  back to the present.  Oh and This
Newsgroup is likely the worst place to try and find a seller... People
have been Beaten(verbally) within an inch of their life for attempting
to buy or sell accounts here.  If you really must buy an account tho
They run $3-500US on various sites you can find by using google...
personally $40 is a much better deal.
