So, your example of two, sometimes three, people (of whom I've never 
heard) indicates a more broad Usenet experience then? Funny. Presumptuous 
and a bit arrogant, but funny. I don't consider it at all any sort of 
standard operational procedure in mature, civilized discussion.

Because that "honesty" is, of course, to be taken as gospel? My thought 
on that is that if there is a possibility that one's opinion might be 
tainted by subjectivity, then one should try to take the high road or 
"polite diplomacy". My thinking someone is an "addlebrained fuckwit" 
doesn't necessarily make it so, therefore, my stating as much does not 
represent fact and becomes little more than an insult.

Gotta admit, that's another one with which I'm unfamiliar. I don't 
frequent any other groups, however. Like I've said, I barely have time 
for this one.
