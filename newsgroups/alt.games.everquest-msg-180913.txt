It should be automatic. You log on. You look around to make sure you're 
not trying to share someone else's space.

People who are buying low and selling high. They have no idea what they 
should search for, so they go browsing. Seems to me it would be easier to 
use /bazaar and search for anything for, say, a human.

Some of the most fun I've had in the bazaar was when I just wanted to 
liquidate all the gear off one character (and bank) so I could start 
another off fresh. I priced everything at like 75% of the lowest price I 
could find on it. I know I gave several buy-low-sell-high people 
aneurisms. (sp?)
