Obviously, this depends on where you're soloing. Spells for Lower Guk
are very different from spells for fear-kiting. But, I presume you're
asking about fear-kiting. So, here's my Skyfire setup:

Pre-attack: Minion of Shadows, Augmentation of Death, Manaskin, Shield
of the Magi, Lich

In roughly the order I cast them:

Dooming Darkness: Fast casting, low mana snare. Used for short pulls
and general slowing down.

Splurt: For longer pulls, low damage, low aggro, easy to get the
critter chasing your pet rather than you. Also, a good second DoT for
larger MObs.

Invoke Fear: Cast as soon as your pet goes after a snared MOb.

Bond of Death: First DoT, also keeps you at max health while running
Lich.

Deflux: Fast life drain, direct damage. 

Insidious Retrogression: Better damage than Ignite Bones with a
slowing component. Used as a nuke and to reapply snare. 

Shadowbond: For keeping the pet alive when it starts to get whacked.

Feign Dead: When pulls go bad.

Swap Lich in and out with Splurt when it needs to be recast. Pet
rebuffs come from my PoG necro pants.
