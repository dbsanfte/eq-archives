Maybe someone could tell me what's going on.  I seem to have lost all the
animations for my character.  Whenever I'm in combat,  I look like a statue.
I feign death, I stand there.  I bandage myself, I don't move at all.  I SIT
DOWN and don't move a muscle.

That being said, everything is still working OK.  I still  do damage, the
mob stops banging on me,  my hit points go up and nothing works until I
stand up again.

Does anyone have any idea what I need to do?  I've done thorough file checks
and no difference.
