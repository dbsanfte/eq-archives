 Hmm.. Are you sure about that? I honestly can't remember but I'll take
your word for it. I seem to remember wanting to be at max melee range
for a reason. Although I know we designate a ramp tank so.. Uh..
Whatever. I just stand there and hit my kick button!

 Unless he turns around. Then it's 'Run away!'

 I don't know, I think RZ is harder than Saryn/TT. The event is
basically the same but you need to be tighter. Although no dots/mana
drains help a lot. Out of Phase 5 I'd rank them as; Bert (gimp), Cazic,
Inny, RZ. The last two are close though and you could flip them if you
want to have Inny the toughest. We didn't have that hard of a time with
Inny so that's just how I'd rank our progession.
