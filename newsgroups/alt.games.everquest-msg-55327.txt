I fully agree. Shortly after it got changed to be an undead playground
at night, and in view of all the complaints about how it was a
deathtrap, I tested it.

I made a level one human (very nightblind), ran her all the way from
Freeport to Highhold Pass, and back, at night, without incident. Some
pretty hairy areas for a level one. 

I was told that I got lucky, and that one round trip didn't prove
anything - Kithicor was a deathtrap, and that was that.

So I made a level one Halfling, and ran her along the north wall, at
night, from WC to HHP, TWENTY times (ten round trips). Never got
touched. Had to pause a few times while nasty things passed nearby,
but that's just exercising simple caution and good sense.

Sure, I've had my share of trouble in the zone, but it's not an
automatic death trap by any stretch of the imagination.

Heck, though, some people think the Dragon Portal in Iceclad is a
deathtrap, too. Go figure.
