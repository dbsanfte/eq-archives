Shaman are the buff/debuff masters. You'll get a wide range of
situational spells to cast on the melee (and even the casters in some
cases) that will add to their chances in battle. Plus, since you can
scavange mana off your health, you can often keep fighting melee
providing there's extra healing mana in the group to keep you topped
off. In later levels (situation dependent again) you'll have a pet to
throw in for extra melee damage. If there's no chanter around, you get
some very servicable haste spells to put on your tanks and melee, and
you will slow and debuff the mobs they are fighting. You can get the
resists and combat stats of your melee folks right up to the high levels
they need for pesky casting mobs. 

While every caster should always try to have every spell at every level
if possible, it's probably the shaman that use (on a fairly regular
basis) almost every trick in their bags as the group/raid mob situations
change.

Shaman: We don't *make* the raid party. We make the raid party more
efficient.
