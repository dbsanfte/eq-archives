Sometimes to find a spell in Felwithe you have to check every merchant
in the zone that contains the caster guilds. Try the merchants in the
magic shop near the zone entrace, any standing outside the guilds, and
those in the back-rooms of all the guilds. I'm thinking there might be
a back-room in the magic shop too.
