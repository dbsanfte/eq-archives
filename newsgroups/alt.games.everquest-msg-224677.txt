Yes, DOTs do stack (well, bard Chant DOTs don't, nor do some enchanter 
DOTs, due to each having a debuff component).  Thats not the reason DOTs 
don't work well in a group setting, rather, its the fact that mobs have 
to live long enough for all the DOT tics to finish up in order to get 
full efficiency out of them.  In a group, mobs tend to die fast, and so 
DOTs tend to not do their full damage.

This problem of wasted damage isn't unique to DOTs, of course, a big 
nuke that will do say 25% of a mob's HP total that lands when the mob is 
down to 10% life is also wasting most of the mana spent.  If you have a 
snarer, even if the nuke lands at 26% and knocks the mob down to 1% you 
are wasting some of the effect; the mob would have started running at 
20%, and your melee could have killed him for free!

Similarly, Slow can be a waste of mana; I frequently see slow land on 
mobs that are at 20% of their life, and dying fast.  This means the slow 
saves very little of the beating... and a nuke or heal would have been a 
better use of that mana.

This is why I suggested a shaman heavy group would be better off going 
for big targets rather than small ones; most groups do well killing mobs 
that are as low level as possible while still DB to their highest level 
member; fast easy kills in large numbers.  However, to get the most use 
out of shaman abilities, its important that the mobs you kill live 
longer: time for the DOTs to wear all the way thru, time for Slows to 
land and have substantial effect.

I'm not sure that this strategy is worth while at lower levels, 
honestly, killing easy mobs yeilds almost as much exp as killing hard 
ones, and you can go thru -far- more easy mobs than hard ones.  But up 
in the 50s we get bonuses for killing mobs close to our level, and 
hopefully this will make a "few hard kills" strategy competitive.
