RE: New Qeynos Area quests on FV

/bug the problem.

TLC and quest problems have always been an issue on FV. Since these
quests are so new VI might maje an adjustment to make the itmes
non-TLC.

Hire a Newbie to get one for you, or /auction to buy one. I know it is
a pain, but unless they fix it, you are stuck. I have a level 10
Ranger on FV now, so I feel your pain. I still have an extra account I
can fire up (I cancelled it, but there is some paid time left). I will
try to get a pelt for you.

There is an upside to TLC on FV......Almost everything can be sold or
traded. I see lots of stuff for sale on FV that is "NODROP" on regular
servers. It helps FV to have a better economy. Players are lower
levels can get items that higher levels want and are willing to pay
for.

I've got 3 accounts, but I'm not a "loot-whore" :-P I just can't stick
to 1 character. I would be more than happy to help anyone with a TLC
quest issue free of charge. As mentioned above I will try to pick up a
pelt for you. Send me a tell in-game, I usually play PST evenings.

Working around TLC can be a quest all by itself :-)
