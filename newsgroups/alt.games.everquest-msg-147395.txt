I served my country with Blood and Honor, I have helped the weak and
freed the enslaved. I have killed and have been shot helping others.
I have lost friends in combat. I have tried to live the  Ranger Creed
thoughout my service. I have given 15 year of my life to defend my
country and it's way of life. And I have without hesitation.

And what have you done for your country, Tyger. 
You've got some balls to attack my Military Career.
I'm the guy marching "in" the parade on Veterans Day and Memorial Day,
right along with the WW2, Korea and Nam' Vets.

Once agian, What have you done for you country.
