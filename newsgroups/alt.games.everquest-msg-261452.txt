You can only research your own classes spells and (at higher level) some 
of the priest type class spells.

Which sucks royally (level 55 ench with very high research, my mage kept 
failing his pets. I never could find another mage that had the research 
skill...)

I'd just dump my skillpoints into it... it's expensive, but less 
expensive than grinding it up... unless there's a GoD quest for this 
awful 'tradeskill'.
