Ok, I think I understand what you're saying, just never had a problem
with it.  I found quickly that keeping the wurm's chest (or rather the
"air" just in front of its chest) centered where I would normally have
the target mob works pretty well (means wading into the wurm's body
when behind it).

You mean like the guardian that appeared out of nowhere when I was the
puller and only melee in a group keeping a Rage camper company?  It
wasn't quite nasty enough to kill me before the cleric and most of
the robes got camped (sometimes LH is just plain great to have).

Well that certainly would make the zealots easier for a necro than a
melee.
