The only difference between the integration of the netscape suite and
the microsoft suite(IE,Frontpage express, and OE) is that the netscape
suite is now a single executable.  I've been using it since netscape
Gold(3.01)  I've grown fond of the interface.  I like NG specific kill
filters for reasons stated earlier.  

OE is a late comer, and in my opinion, still has enough holes to drive a
van through.  Netscape and Agent. Agent being a "real" newsreader from
the ground up.  Are mature(by todays standards) and stable.  Even though
Netscape like OE is a newsreader lite.

Better, well, I've heard that Emacs is pretty good. I however don't have
the time or energy to configure it.  further, There is appproved and
un-approved software at work, Agent isn't approved, so Its OE or
Netscape.
