This is the perfect analogy.  
FWIW my ranger rarely crosses more than 3 zones on foot.  I *HATE* the boats.
I've never EVER resorted to sending a personal tell when I want a port.  I do a
"/OOC Looking for port to XYZ, paying 20 PP, can run to where you are".  I
always pay up front, and I pay a "tip" on top of my fare if I feel the Porter
had to wait on me.  
I can't ever recall being "stranded" for long.
