I stand corrected, then, I'd heard that only Malo (back when 60 was the 
top level in the game) was unresistable, I'm glad to hear its not just 
the shaman line that is.  I'm not nearly of a level (on either shaman or 
mage) to actually have experience with this myself.

Malosi getting resisted is a very large irritant for me, as when I need 
the line is when its least likely to work; if I can land Malosi I can 
probably land anything else I know how to cast; in particular I often 
find I get three resists in a row casting malosi and yet hit repeatedly 
for full damage with my nukes, magic and fire alike!

But if Mala is unresistable, then why would I care what the recast timer 
is?  Multiple mobs, I guess.

My observation that Malaise seems to be the tool for the job 90% of the 
time is similar to my feelings on Root, Stun and Snare; cheap, quick to 
cast, do the job you want done just as well as (or better than, in teh 
case of stuns under 61) the higher level equivalents in almost every 
case.  Oh, and Flash of Light > Blinding Luminescence, but since 99% of 
people with that spell line never use it as anything other than an Arena 
gag, thats not quite so interesting a comparison.
