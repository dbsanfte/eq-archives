    Check the original thread again, Jakugg. Dan proved it wasn't a function
of character level or skill in swimming. He may have proved class, too - I'd
have to check. But whether race had an effect was an open question, one that
I posed after the initial tests based on observations of my own Iksar monk.
If you have time tonight, make human and iksar monks with identical STA and
sink them in water. I think you'll be surprised at how long scaly can hold
his breath for.
