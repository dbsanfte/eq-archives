Aye.  I cleaned up a Frontpage-generated HTML document yesterday,
containing nothing but text, separated into paragraphs.  The original,
no DTD on it, of course, was 80k. The cleaned one, using XHTML 1.0,
was 20k, including stylesheet to replace all the layout information
that was scattered throughout the document.

Also, by reducing the images, you save a lot.  You do not need 32bit
colors on a simple map.  Reduce it to 16 or 32 colours, and you save a
lot of space.

Many of the pages are generated by programs taking its content from
databases.  If you take some care when you set it up and present it,
you'll use less bandiwth.  Using frames will also help.
