which class has the tools best suited to that environment?
what level are the mobs?
which PERSON knows the zone, mobs and pathing the best?

I guess a generic example would be something like Qvic.  An outdoor zone,
"ideal" pulling conditions for a bard.  In comparisons with cross server
friends (e.g James, whos guild uses bards for all their pulling), to our
times when either me or bards pull.  My quickest clearing time (leaving the
zonein, to all named dead) with a raid of 30 people was 40 mins.  A good
bard can do it in 40-50 mins too, maybe it takes an "exceptional" monk to do
the same, but the point is either class can do it, and either class with a
person on top of their game, the time is still similar.

On a contrast, Txevu is more suited for monks pulling.  So you now have
"ideal" pulling conditions for a monk. I've still used bards to pull or tag
in the zone, because at the highend class becomes a blur, and it comes down
to individual skill and know-how, not what class they play.

Thats the bottom line really.  At lower levels, sure its easier to split
with a bard, ranger, enchanter, cleric... pacify is a tremendously powerful
and fast tool.  At higher levels, skill more than makes up for any specific
class song, clicky or ability.  it just blurs into one, you have good
pullers, and you have poor pullers.  That is the distinction. Not bard,
monk, whatever.

Anybody who thinks "gimp_classx owns best_classy" is a moron. Plain and
simple.
