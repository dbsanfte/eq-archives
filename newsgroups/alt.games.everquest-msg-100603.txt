On Mon, 25 Mar 2002 20:57:25 -0500, "Zibro" <wazup> (if that IS his
real name) conspiratorially whispered:

Once the loda kai in the tunnel are no longer any good get your
friends (you will have some friends to group with at that point,
right? This isn't a fungal tunic twink is it?) to go with you to
paludal caverns to kill aliens (plergs). They have terrible attack
numbers and poor AC and go down hard - but you NEED someone who can
cure disease. A BL or shaman can do it at that level.
