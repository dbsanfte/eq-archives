I've been playing some UO because my cheap brother plays in on a free
server.

I like the concept of being able to have automated player controled
merchants. Would this work in EQ? Not at the moment, the fron end of the
supply chain is copletely npc controled, except for the odd foraged veg or
dropped spider silk. Most items needed in bulk are store bought.
but wouldn't it be nice to have players mine for ore and gems, woodcutters
for bows and arrows, grain farming for baking and so on. It would be a grand
scheme to implement and probably not worth the efford, but personaly I would
love to be able to mine of ore or cut my own bowstaffs.
I also like that you can automate your merchants in UO, you don't actully
have to be online to do business.
I'd like to have some players controled npc to peddle my surplus brews and
arrows.

Anyway, what do you lot think? Turn over the player economy to the players,
as Verant likes, by opening up the supply chain? And what about automated
vendors?
