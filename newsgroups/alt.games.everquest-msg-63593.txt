How do you not know what the problem is? Uh AOL maybe. The idea that people
still see AOL as an Internet Service Provider and not a Content Provider
(<----------this is what they are) perplexes me. Get a regular ISP for
crying out loud. They don't use BS shells like AOL. All you do is dial up
authenticate and boom start EQ.....that's it...........nothing running in
the background....EQ only.......sounds nice EH! Also if you have high
bandwidth alternatives in your area give that a shot. AOL was to your first
computer and online experience as training wheels were to your first bike.
But back to the point it is the year 2001 get with the program. --
