Redleg,

Try getting ahold of the family services center (or whatever its called for
whichever branch you are in) there in Germany and see if they offer an ISP
for military members.  When I was stationed in Greece they offered a local
dialup that was actually on an OC1 to its military members stationed there
as well as a library with access (of which I do not see you visiting
everytime you want to play EQ). <grin>
