Depends on whether you mean worthless in terms of "worthless to the
guild's raid strength", or if you mean "total crap".

Lot's of epics are worthless to a raid. Druid and Wizard epic near the
top of the list. But if you're out soloing or in an xp group, they rock.

Depends what tier you're on when you get it I guess. We are one kill
away from our first two chanter epics, and we are still VERY happy with
SoS. Don't know what you're getting that's so much better, or how we get
that, but SoS is pretty damned good for us. Particularly for the rapid
rebuffing after a raid wipe. So no.. I'd put chanter epic far on the
other end of the worthless scale.

I know nothing of the Pally epic and have never even seen one that I
noticed.

Hardly. And willsappers aren't exactly dropping like mayapples either.
We still dont' have one and we raid DN whenever we can get the forces.
People who keep saying the warrior epic is crap really annoy me. There's
*not* that much better out there until you have sleeper keys and get
SoD's and stuff on that level, and we don't. Warrior epic would still be
a major upgrade for our MA's in terms of hate/aggro, not to mention that
it's still a guild "status symbol" to flash around with the lower tier
guilds.  We need several more excursions deep into Air, though, to
finish up our first few.

> A Swiftblade from statue and your all set

And is Statue "probably easier than the Queen in Chardok" too? We
smacked the Queen easily the last couple times. Your comment about "half
the mob that Vindi is" intrigues me. Vindi is still kicking our ass on
the rare times we find him up. I wonder if we should figure a way to
just try to pull the damned statue. he he.

> Necro - risk v reward just isnt there for this epic

Hell of an investment, true.

Other "worthless" epics for guild purposes? SK.  Druid/Wiz (as I said).
I have no clue what the BL epic does, so I don't know where it falls in
usefulness.
