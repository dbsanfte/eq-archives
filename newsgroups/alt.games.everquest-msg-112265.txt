Hehe, As a 60 Enchanter with KEI I must say that the KEI addiction is funny.
I never play anon and get tells from all over Norrath. People port from
anywhere to come for a fix and then port back. Perhaps I should start
accepting donations, I think  will become quite well off over next few
months )

Jontom, look me up on Xegony for your KEI needs )
