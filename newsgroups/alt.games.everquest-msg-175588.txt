Stamina is related as a base stat for hitpoints.  That is, the higher
your stamina, the higher your hitpoints.  Stamina increases after 100
no longer affect weapon speed decreases caused by fatigue, but
they still do generate hitpoints, up to the max (255 pre-AAXP)
available.   A warrior (or anyone else) with 255 STA will have a
LOT more hitpoints than one with 100 STA.  At level 60, for
instance, a warrior with 255 STA would have *930* HPs more
than a warrior with 100 STA.

That's (probably) not critical for leveling, but it is if you ever want to
tank end-game mobs.  (And probably now even in PoP zones where the
mobs are hitting for 350-500....)
