Yes, this is a big drawback of the beastlord pet... and a big strength.

When you get your first pet, you are used to having to do all the killing on
your own... along comes a pet that doubles your melee output and tanking
capability (cause you can back off and let him tank when you run lhp)

As you level up, he's less and less of your big gun, and more and more just a
helper similar to a shaman pet, and you have to shoulder more and more of the
load, becoming melee again.  Then boom, pet upgrade.  Suddenly little fluffy
becomes Big fluffy and for a few levels is once more an overpowering
contributor to your battles... plus you have quite an array of spells by now,
and this is the perfect opportunity to learn to be a pet handler on the lines
of a mage... stand back and cast spells while the pet does the melee end for
you.  Level up more, things swing back the other way, luckily your melee skills
didn't go in the dumpster, since just a few levels ago you had a very wimpy pet
and had to do all the melee work yourself.

Eventually you turn into a real beastlord, with melee on the par of a weak monk
and a pet on a par with a shaman's, and a shaman line of spells to boost your
own and your pet's performance and degrade that of your foes... people always
said shaman/monk was the best duo in the game, well a beastlord is in many ways
a single class with the power of that duo!

Then as you level up further, you start getting spells good enough to actually
boost the performance of groups, even raids you travel with... really in
retrospect this is one of the best designed classes for the "I want to do
everything" casual players in the game; its funny how most people dismissed it
as a pale shadow of a class in the early days after its release.
