Yup, but that's not the subject here.  We're referring to a command that 
lets you turn channels on and off.  I gave up months ago on it, but I 
remember it being in a list of all EQ commands.  Something like "/channel 
shout" or "/channel shout off|on".  I think I even tried numbers in case 
the channels were numbered like the languages.  Never got it figgered out.
