Well you could do that one this way, kill them no exp res them, and then
lock them in the box.

I like your idea on the faction hit though.  Some moron ranger druid or
high elf cleric/ paladin decides to attack, or inappropriately interact
with Fironia Vie and boom, all Tunarian factions dropped to at minimum
Dubious, so they can't do the quests to raise the faction with their
guild any more, not necessarily KOS, just enough to screw them out of
training, their epic etc.  KOS could work too, but I like the dubious as
it makes them suffer more in my opinion.
