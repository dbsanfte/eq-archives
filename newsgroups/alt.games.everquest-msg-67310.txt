Just wanted to know if anyone else was getting this error message.....

After trying to log in, I get this and then it crashes.....


I know that information on it is on the support site somewhere, but this =
didn't happen (unless I am mistaken) until AFTER the patch today, so it =
makes me think that they knew they were screwing something else up and =
so they patched anyway and put up that link on the site.....

I dunno.....I just know like usual patching one thing, screws up =
something else.....

I just wish that they would give everyone a refund on their montly =
payment when they screw up like this.....they will more than make up for =
it when all is finally working.....

add to that those of us that had to upgrade just to play the game =
now.....tho I'm not gonna complain about that, upgrading is a fact of =
life for a gamer or pc owner anyway, though I was still pissed :-P

Anywho, I guess I've asked my question.....
