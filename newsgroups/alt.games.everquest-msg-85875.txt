Hello.  I was wondering if someone had some info on a few mobs in HK. If you
go back into the jail a bit, theres a few interesting spawns I wanted to
try, but I'm not sure if they assist.  I know Osargen is fine, and hes
around level 22 or so.  There is also the fake Princess, a human names
Purchin Oddsbot, a dark eld named Dyrna Nlith, and another human named
Flayer Hopkins.  The only one I tried was the fake princess, and I found out
the guards didn't like that, and attacked me.  One of the humans is blue to
me, and I was wondering if the dark elf, or the other human might assist if
I attack.  I can't find any useful info on these mobs.

-Dak
