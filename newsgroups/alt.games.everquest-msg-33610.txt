You are one of the lucky ones.  I had to remove my windows keys from my
keyboard after the fourth or fifth time I did that.  I cannot get back in.
I can switch to eq, and type away, and camp out if I am not being attacked,
or /q out.  I cannot see anything though.

I also use Win2k.  Probably depends on the video card among possibly other
things.
