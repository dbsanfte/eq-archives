I don't group a whole lot, but I found myself in a slightly similar 
situation in PoD a few weeks ago. My group wiped (some died, some, like 
yours truly, legged it). By the time we could regroup, the camp was 
taken by somebody else, and there were some sharp words between the 
leader of my group and the leader of the other group (by that time, I 
just wanted out, as XP was so slow compared to soloing). Eventually, we 
gave up the camp and left for PoI.

Anyway, my point is... Is a wiped out camp generally considered a 
vacated camp, or does the wiped group have a claim to take it back (as 
in Scott's situation?). I guess that it can be argued that if you can't 
hold a camp without dying, you have no claim to it.
