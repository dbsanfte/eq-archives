Most players are familiar with EQ1 to some extent and are experienced with
the chat window. There is more than enough chat in there (about 90% inane
crap) and sooner or later most turn off /ooc. Granted it doesn't have the
chat bubbles but I'd guess the screen would be filled with bubbles if it
included the sheer volume of crap from /ooc itself. Think of it as a
blessing.
