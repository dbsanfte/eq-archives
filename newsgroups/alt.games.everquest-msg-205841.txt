In Cazic Thule last night, there were four Greenblood Piranha in the wall 
right next to the zone in.  They would agro on you, but unless you walked 
up to them, they could not hurt you.  Unfortunately, their regen rate 
seemed to be astronomical while there, so DoTs were pretty well 
ineffective.  I did petition it, as they had managed to kill a few 
people, not sure if it was fixed.
