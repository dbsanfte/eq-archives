I know when you get pulled into a PoP zone by a raid when you're not
flagged for the zone you have a certain amount of buffer time in case
someone goes linkdead (or you do) when you're allowed to stay in zone.

Question - if you get pulled into a zone by a raid and immediately
camp, do you have this buffer time even if you log in much later when
the raid is already gone?

I'm thinking of parking my paladin in Fire by tagging along with a
raid one time and just camping there until later, when I can gank a
jopal or something else for one of the million knight weapons that
drop when I can quickly log the paladin in and grab it. That will
work, right? I'll have a couple minutes to loot it before it kicks me
from the zone even though I'll probably be the only one there, yes?
