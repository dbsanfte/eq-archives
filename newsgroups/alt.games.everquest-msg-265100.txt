Yes, they did.  There are now 4 separate entrances to tradeskill instances 
in each village zone.  Was sort of funny yesterday, as everyone was still 
congregating at the original instance.  Course, right now that's the only 
one with a merchant for the tradeskill components.  But I found it much 
better to just go and pick up the components I needed from the full 
instance, and then run and craft in one of the new instances that were 
completely empty.  No lag there.  :)
