If you enchant the bars, you can sell the finished product for about 5pp
over cost.  This is just barely enough to cover cost of failure, and will
allow you to milk a nest egg for a long long time.  I've been using the
"same" 2000pp to get my skill from 190something up to the current 232.

The problem is that it gets really tedious waiting for your mana to regen
after enchanting a stack of platinum.  A couple of times, I've brought my
wife's bard in to sing the mana song for me, but I can't do that if she's
wanting to play.

So I fish, I read, or I work on other skills while the mana is coming back.

I get C2 next level...
