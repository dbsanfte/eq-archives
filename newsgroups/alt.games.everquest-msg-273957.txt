well if you want argue word usage, it is clear that he was using pussy to
mean wimp or coward, niether of which has anything to do with vagina.
People have argued, as in the article that this is where it came from and
this is what it means.  In this context it doesn't mean vagina, kitten,
woman or anything other than coward.

as for accepting it's correct, it clearly is not correct.

And pussy used for "coward" does not mean vagina.  So then up comes the
argument that it came about (ie its etymology) in the same way and hence is
offensive.  Now it's been shown not to have came about the same way.

Let's be serious for a minute.  A minute to be played, an attacker takes a
soft tackle because the defender has already put 3 players out in that game
for a month, so instead going for broke and launching himself and perhaps
winning he takes a soft tackle.  You friend disgutedly calls him a pussy.
Now for 1 second do you think your friend's making any sort of sexist
comment about the attacker?

So whichever way you wish to argue - that the word was used in a sexist way,
or that it comes from sexist roots and thus shouldn't be used is wrong.

I see no one thinking "pussy" for "coward" objects to "beaver" for working
hard.

well for starters there's "pussy" for coward, but you don't want to accept
that.  Are you claiming you've never heard "you pussy cat" to egg someone
on?  "As tame as a kitten" used for something which is easily intimidated?
Surely you have.

> Women on the otherhand are disparagingly linked to cowardice routinely.

Apart from "sissy", that seems to be it.  Blanche's article is a beat up and
certainly "The Guide" is not recognised as authoritive, not even a resume of
"Blanches" is given.

where is this paragraph in entirety?

well it shatters the myth that "pussy" as a term used for cowardice - more
appropriately, wussiness or wimpiness because it is milder than "coward" -
is derived from a term used for women's genitalia which is how I read your
argument.

That is not the timeline given, if you re-read it says

1. pussy as endearment for women at same time as for effeminate men (14th
century, my bad that should be 16th, 1583)


2. pussy for vagina raises and persists (late 19th C)



> Since pussy as coward doesn't predate pussy as vagina,

yes it does you are not reading, I will repeat it:

Incorrect conclusion because it's based on an incorrect premise.

can we stop bothering about what you call mobs?  We've established that we
don't call them vaginas.  FTR I have never called one a "ho", "whore", or
even "bitch".  I have called them "bastards" and "bastages" depending on who
I am playing with at the time.
