 Not all monks are equipped as well as that. Exception rather than the
rule I'd say. Sure, members of top-end guilds will be able to kill more
mobs than a guildless casual player. However that's not anything new. 

 Now, should soloers that can take areas in heavily populated areas that
would be more suited for a full group of non 60's? Not in my opinion. I
wont argue about that. When I solo I go to areas that aren't populated
and I don't take camps that others would want. For example, I could more
than likely solo Drolvarg Captain area in KC but you would never see me
there because I could get more XP with less hassles elsewhere.

 EQ needs more content. Nothing new there either. Actually, there is a
lot of content there that's unused. Verant should work on ways to get
people into those zones. If a zone sucks for the average group, funwise,
they wont be going there. Sirens Grotto comes to mind. I don't have fun
there so I don't even suggest it as a destination. And I doubt upping
the xp on those mobs and giving a nice group bonus would do anything
toward that end for me. Look at reasons why people don't use certain
zones. More than likely it will have nothing to do with the XP rate.
That's what Verant should be looking at changing.

Nothing wrong with that. That's what a lof of people are saying Verant
should have done to begin with, rather than nerfing XP. Dangle the
carrot for those who want 'optimal xp' but leave the casual/solo players
alone.
