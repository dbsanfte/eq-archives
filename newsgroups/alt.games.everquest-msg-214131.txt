My #1 alt on Karana is an enchanter, so I would have made one anyway, 
probably ;)  I wouldn't want to do another ranger, and not many other 
classes appeal.  Except maybe a Shaman, but I don't know much about them 
and they seem too high maintenance with all that canning.

I think just living with one of us and putting up with us should be 
enough!

The only reason I joined was because Xari did first, and she wanted us to 
be tagged in the same guild *shrug*.  As I don't really know anybody in 
it outside of her, I will probably de-tag the next time I'm on there.  
Similarly, she's now looking at leaving a guild she really likes on 
Karana because I've left it.

While I agree that there aren't enough AGErs dedicated to FV to form a 
viable guild there (I'm not sure I'll be around there much longer once I 
join a new and hopefully busier guild on Karana), I think it'd be nice to 
have most of us at least tagged in the same guild.  If not, we always 
have the age channel ;)
