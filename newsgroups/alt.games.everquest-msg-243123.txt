Just a bit of "tooting my own horn" time here...

After two years (okay, on and off for 2 years, only got
crazy-diehard-serious about it for over a week) of want, nay, lust...


I got my Eyepatch of Plunder!


So much time in Iceclad, I could vomit. Three times. But this is certainly
one of those things for me, that made me smile big enough to make it all
worthwhile. :)

Woot!
