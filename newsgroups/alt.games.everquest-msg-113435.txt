Best way to do anything like this is to have hot keys set up on the
second 'assist' computer to cast spells.

For instance for a druid that is assisting another character:

Spell load out

1 Sow
2 Heal
3 Regen
4 Skin
5 Damage Shield
6 Strength
7 Resistance1
8 (etc)

Then you make hot keys like this:

Sow:
/target <name of other character>
/sit off
/pause20, /cast 1
/sit on

etc for other buffs

Then if you have the 2 computers close to each other you
just run your one character over to the other. Then reach over
and hit the appropriate hot keys for the spells you want cast on you.

You may have to add pauses to space some of the commands out.

You could even do it for assisting during the battle:

For instance:

1 Drones of Doom

/assist <other character>
/sit off
/pause 20, cast 1
/sit on
