I have bought and sold back a couple of drogmors on different characters as
I decide to try a different class...I have found about a 3k give or take
loss on the sell back, always with 130+ charisma....

Since you already have SoW as a bl, and you would be swinging, not medding,
not sure what you would use one for, other than looks...not that there's
anything wrong with that, but unless functional for you, not sure the high
cost for no real benefit is worth it...unless of course you let poor ruff
ruff do ALL the tanking =) ...
