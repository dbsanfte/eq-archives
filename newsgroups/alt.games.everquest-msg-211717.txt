See, I find just the opposite to be true.  A lot of the fundamentalists out
there want Christ to come back so badly that all they're concerned about are
the less-than-tasteful things.  Those things simply must be an indication
that Christ is coming back .. and hopefully he'll be here
day-after-tomorrow.

I put it to you that one extreme is as bad as the other.
