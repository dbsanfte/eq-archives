Yes, I know, but that doesn't preclude getting defense skill as
well, afaik, any more than swinging a mace to get 1hblunt
precludes getting offense as well.

Since your defense skill is capped at 200, the 8 months means
nothing, you can melee for a thousand years and the skill will still
never go up.

More relevant would be "how long did it take you to go from
199 to 200... and were you melee-ing constantly all that time?"

I do think that the skill raises more and more slowly the higher
it gets, even in constant melee.
