Not sure if you remember, but my stupidity caused me to lose a full
5 yellow of experience (from 63.5 to 62.5) a while back.  I definitely
empathize.  OTOH - post 60 an unrezzed death eats 5-6% of a level.
Fighting in a place like PoV Back Cave (been leveling my BL there) you
get around 1 yellow per hour, so that unrezzed death is about 15 minutes
in a group capable of clearing the cave and tunnel.  I'm just not 
sure how I feel about the death penalty as such anymore.  I'd love to
see a system like DAoC where you can't lose a level once attained - 
I think I would anyway.  I'm definitely willing to hear reasons why
that wouldn't be good.
