That's certainly the easiest way.  It doesn't even take "repeated"
attempts.  Just go to the other server and try to create a character
with that name.  If it's not accepted, it means the character already
exists on that server.  (Or else the character name rules have changed
since the time when you created it on your own server, such that the
name is no longer allowed anywhere.  But that's pretty rare.)

Another way would be to send email and see if you get told there's no
such mailbox.  But that requires figuring out something appropriate to
say in the email.  Be polite! :-)

Of course, it may be that the other character with your name turns out
to be under level 10 and not played in the past six months, and thus it
gets deleted during the merge.  Then there'd be no competition for the
name.  But I don't know any way to find that out ahead of time.  (You
might find out it's NOT the case, of course, e.g. by getting a reply to
your email.)
