If you cast a spell to summon a pet and you get a pet that is green to
you and want to summon a higher level pet, click on the pet and cast
Reclaim Energy to get rid of the pet, and you will get some of the
mana back that you used to summon the pet so you won't have to med as
long.  

(of course I'm not sure if SKs will always have green pets since they
get spells at later levels than necros get them; for instance, SKs get
Leering Corpse at level 9, which is a level 4 necro pet spell)
