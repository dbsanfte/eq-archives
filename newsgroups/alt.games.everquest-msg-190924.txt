I got bored with Evercamp, so I decided to give Shadowbane a try.

Shadowbane is sort of a massively multiplayer online version of
warcraft.  The point is to build stuff, but I never got that far.

First the scenery:  It is not hand crafted, instead it is fractally
generated.   Trouble is the idiots do not know how to do fractal
generation.  The fractal dimension is close to an integer.   An
aesthetically pleasing fractal dimension is close to an integer plus
0.5, or an integer plus or minus 0.618   I would say their fractal
dimension is close to integer plus 0.15

So the scenery is monotonous.  It does not matter where you are --
they might as well have put in an infinite flat grey plane, because
after a while you start to not see the scenery any more, mentally
filtering it out.

Then the monsters.   You have to kill lots of monsters, they pop up
fast, and they go down fast.  So it is evercamp all over again.  Go to
monster spawn spot.  Monster pops up kill it, another pops up, kill
it, over and over and over and over, except that to get to the monster
spawn spot you just go in a straight line through monotonous sameness,
instead of threading your way through strange and wonderful mazes.

The graphics is badly out of sync with the physics.  Much of the time
my character walked through statues and features.  Other times my
character stuck in a corner or blind alley formed by invisible
obstacles.

Because there is no first person view, the experience fails to be
immersive.  Because the view is boring, the experience fails to be
immersive.
Because there is very little player physics, the experience fails to
be immersive, you get no feeling that your character is physcially
present in a real world.
Because the player physics is out of sync with the landscape, the
experience is not immersive.

You always remember you are merely playing a game, you never forget,
and think you are really there.
