    We saw it, too. And it can be very lethal if you have an assist healing
scheme in place (target mob, /assist, heal on that person). When fighting
Grieg we ducked out of a few heals we should not have ducked out of. Still
won the fight, but against a mob with more damage output we would have been
messed up.

    We have three separate channels when we raid: general, for target calls
and instructions; healing, for cleric heal calls; and debuff, for debuff
calls. Depending on who you are, you log into various channels and send your
messages to various channels. For example, our warriors are in general only,
as are their aggro calls, whereas a wizard would be in general and debuff
(to see when resists have been lowered). The problem only manifests in the
healing channel, since the debuffers/nukers are all targetting the mob and
most of the tanks are hammering /assist so fast they're on the correct mob
when attack is called (raid XP - gotta love it). Our only workaround at this
time is to not /assist heal and instead either do CHeal rotations on a main
tank or heal strictly within one's own group, calling for aid in the heal
channel if required. Hopefully it'll be a quick fix for next patch.
