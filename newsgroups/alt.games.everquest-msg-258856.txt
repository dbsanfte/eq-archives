Well, kinda.  You can get +2 mana regen starting at level 8 or you can
group with a 16 enchanter (before you hit level 20) and get a buff
that is mildly better (since it has no hp loss attached to it).  Then
you can group with a 29 chanter and get Clarity, which also provide
the same mana regen as what you already had (at level 20)...meaning it
is only better because you dont lose hitpoints.

In any case, I never bothered through these levels.  I soloed them,
for the most part, each in a few hours anyway. =)

Marginally superior, if at all...since you gotta group with the
enchanter and count on him or her to keep casting it on you.

This is pointless.  These buffs last 30 minutes.  You lose more
experience running around for short-duration buffs than you would
allegedly gain by not having to lifetap once every few minutes.

This I forgot about.  I do remember keeping C3 a few times in my late
40's, but still never actually paying for it.
