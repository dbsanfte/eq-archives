Hail,

I was having family guests at home and wanted to show them EQ. Letting play
the kids alone, I realised when I came back that all my characters have been
deleted : a 57, a 23 and a 22.

The chars were deleted friday evening.

Anyone already been in this situation ?
Is there any way to have them back ?

TIA,
