Correct me if I'm wrong, but going with your argument, and leaving out 
any reliance on time ... we are left with:

1) The Universe Exists
2) see 1.

It has no beginning, no end, and its contents are transparent to God, 
for he can see the universe in its entirety both along spatial and 
temporal axis; for time is an illusion perceived only by us. It is like 
a movie unwound with each frame on display.

And time does not exist where God is. He does not act in time, and is 
not bound by causality because where he is there is no cause followed by 
effect. He sees the unwound movie and perceives its entirety.

This carries on.., God's domain is a perfect unity: Static, crystalline, 
unchanging, immutable. Nothing can be changed for there is no future or 
past for change to be imprinted upon, nor is their impetus for change 
because he is perfect in every way.

The totality of possibility is frozen from this divine perspective. His 
will is a singular unchanging, if infinately complex, thought, He does 
not 'ponder' things or 'decide' courses of actions; his Will is simply 
manifest, complete and resolved in its surety.

He did not 'create' the universe in an act of creation, it simply is our 
perception of the manifestation of his Will. Not an effect of his Will 
mind you, for there is no cause, but merely *because* God exists, God's 
Will exists, and because God Wills it, the universe exists, inseparable 
from God, perhaps even indistinguishable from God.
