    PoP tanks will have a massive number of HPs. Well over 10 K buffed, and
that's without the new items. Based on those "mistake" items from the last
patch, the +HPs on an item could go as high as 300 in PoP. And with AA's
adding something like 36% more to those base HPs, I bet you'll see top-level
warriors push towards the max possible mark of 15000 raid-buffed.

    You have greatly missed the point.

    If mobs can chew through a tank that has that many hit points, I don't
want some jackass druid with not-so-good healing along lagging out my raid.
I want another cleric. And I will tell that druid to go roll a real
character (read: cleric) so we can actually deal with stuff. As I pointed
out in the druid CH thread, if you don't give druids a useful raid role
where they are the best available then they will be asked to go away and
make characters that ARE the best at a given role. This is a bad change for
the "incomplete" healers, because it makes raids need more healers than they
do now - and the healers they'll want are clerics.

    See my other post. Guilds are already packing players in to kill stuff
before they all get old and die. This makes it worse.
