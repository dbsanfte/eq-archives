I'm in a similar place. I see it as a hint to quit. I am looking for
something that can help pull me away. The amazing thing is, it should
not be that hard. I have kind of a hate/tolerate relationship with EQ,
yet no new MMORPG that comes out is any better? That is just wrong.

The last time I had big fun was grouping my troll sk and dark elf
cleric on different accounts on the same computer. I did this from
level 30 - 42, with each of them getting KEI before the playing
session for 50 plat each. I then really enjoyed EQ, without downtime.
Then they nerfed/fixed, whatever the hell you want to call it but the
outcome was the same, the ability to use KEI until 45. My cleric is
just 43 now, but I don't really feel like making that crawl with my
current downtime. Getting C1 or C2 is just not worth it, they don't
last long enough.

I thought about this too, but then I think of the really low amount of
money you'd get today for a 56 druid with some okay gear and its epic,
who hasn't really raided POP at all and only has 3 run aa. It really
would not be worth selling the account for the piddley amount I'd get.
Might be better to just quit, mothball the cdroms and password in case
there are insane improvements.

On the other hand you can get some things which rival older planes
armor, for practically nothing now. A newbie can make a few hundred
plat a night in the bazaar selling bone chips and spider silk.

It isn't really worth it to sell it. get a part time job then quit it
if you want to have some money.
