Sure, you get the point, any two zones with lots of people wanting ports
and
capable of paying well.  I'd guess DL wouldn't be as good, actually,
since
the mobs drop Chit (pardon my Ogre) and there are quite a few high level,

port capable (and even TL capable) people hunting there, who aren't going

to ask you to run to the FV zone line.  For the same reason, a 50% res
capable
cleric shouldn't rush off to really high level zones in the hopes of
cleaning up;
although the victims are relatively rich, they expect a 90% res or better
unless
its late at night and there is little hope of a "real" cleric coming
along.

I get the same thing at 52, actually, there are people I group with from
time
to time who explicitly don't want my puny 90% res, they get 56 level+
guildmates or buddies to come give em the 96%.  To me the difference gets

vanishingly small at that point, but thems the breaks.
