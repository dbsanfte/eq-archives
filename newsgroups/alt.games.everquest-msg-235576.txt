Take a look at the AA list for druids. (I haven't since I don't play 
one.) If you don't see any real "must have" AA skills, and since you 
don't even group much, say nothing of raid, I don't see right now where 
it's getting you a whole hell of a lot. There's one or two really nice 
AA's for wizards, so I don't regret getting it, but I'm not finding 
myself spending any serious time there yet.
