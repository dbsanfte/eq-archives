Maybe he's totally computer illiterate?   I've read this whole thread and it
might as well be in a foreign language.  
My old computer was slow as hell "in game".  Great for everything else.  I
would have come here for opinions but decided to let my BF pick out the
upgrade.  (I had a pretty good chunk of change set aside, and can now run
merrily through the bazaar without terrible lag).  This guy may be limited in
funds and hoping to get the biggest bang for his buck.
