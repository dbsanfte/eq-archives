I note that you went from 26 to 29 in one session... Wow.

Getting an enchanter pet into combat is kinda tough. The most practical
way I've found is to root the mob once he's back to camp and then stand
closer than everyone else to get that one hit. Pulling can get kinda tricky,
because you never know when the animation is going to go haring off after
some mob that malo'd you on the pull...


Thanks for the session write up. Very entertaining and informative!
