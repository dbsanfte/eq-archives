Not at all, it's actually set up quite differently.

You cannot fight anyone from your realm, not even duel them. You can only
fight players from other realms, and must be level 15 to begin doing that.
You are already KOS in the opposing realms and that can never change, so no
problem there either.

You cannot lose experience or equipment as a result of PvP, so the power of
grief players is really minimal here. However, there are no level limits
beyond 15, so there can(and have been) instances of higher level players
decimating groups of lower level players. But with not much to lose, what
the hey? Go have fun:)

On the reward side, however, the idea is to raise large armies of your
realmmates to overpower your enemies, take over their keeps, and capture
their relics(Such as Merlin's Staff, Scabbard of Excalibur, etc), which then
have beneficial effects on every player in your realm so long as they remain
under the control of your realm.

Comparing it with UO is like comparing apples and oranges. I played EQ for
2.5 years and enjoyed it(my account is still active actually), but DAoC is
just as enjoyable.
