Tradeskill caps are now 300 keep in mind, not 252 (modified).  Also, as I 
stated in my earlier post, make sure the people in question have the 
relevant tradeskill AAs Mastery 3, and Salvage 3.  Salvage gives a chance 
of recovering components even on a failed combine.  Salvage 1 has already 
saved me over 30k plat.
