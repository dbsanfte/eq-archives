Bah, didn't take me any time at all to type it, as I'm an incredibly fast
typist.  I probably hammered that out faster than most people can type 1/4
that much.

And we can hope that some people realize they are being made the fool after
reading what I wrote.  If you ( anyone who read it ) still don't get it, do
a search on his posts, and you can see the pattern - a few "intelligent"
questions, than an idiot thread posted for one reason only - to generate a
lot of stupid traffic.  The "intelligent" threads are dwindling and the
stupid ones are growing.  "Please stop posting about the attack" followed by
4 off-topic threads about the attack.  Pa-leeeeze people.  Step 1: Place
fingers on eyelid.  Step 2: Pry them open.

Then again, if they haven't figured out he's a moron toll ( and nothing
else ) yet, they probably won't.
