I've had great luck with Bard/Paladin duos for some reason.  Get a
little healing from the Pallie and some tank-ability.

I'd lean towards a shaman for the third.  Although I'm sure a druid
would be fine too.

Could start the shaman and warrior together in Halas as barbarians
(night blind though that can be remedied) and a half-elf Bard in
Qeynos.  Easy enough for them to meet up in Blackburrow after a few
levels...

Something to keep in mind:  Based on myself, RL friends and some
Guildies; rarely is your first character the one you stick with
forever....
