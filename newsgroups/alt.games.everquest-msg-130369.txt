I know *g* I found one eventually.  It was just frustrating to get stuff 
like "just be more careful" and "I can only bind myself" responses 
instead of just "sorry, I don't want to leave right now."  Well, and 
frustrating to try and find a bind just inside city limits late at  
(real life) night in Qeynos.  I really think more casters should go 
there.  Those decaying skellies carry some uber loot for casters, you 
know.

(that's okay though, because I can usually find a sow for donation 
*real* easy when I want to do a quick bank run :D)
