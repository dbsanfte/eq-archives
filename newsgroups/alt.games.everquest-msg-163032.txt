I'm keeping my curing kit, etc. in the bank while I go hunting for
components, and one of the things I found (after a brief panic) is that the
kit will only work if it's in your inventory - not in the bank.  Might be a
newbie mistake, but hey - I'm a newbie, so...

Incidentally, the newbie armor is a real bear to find all the components
for.  I think those damn Giant Field Rats shave regularly.
