I kept in mind that my monk is very poorly equipped. With exception of 2 
items, he's wearing all the stuff he had at level 35. I do not have a 
single piece from Growth. I have such scary things as Drolvarg Mantle, 4 
ac bracer, cured slippers, FBSS (0 ac), Gemmed gloves, and nothing in 
the ranged slot :) I don't have the quest robe, or fungi tunic

Oh, your AC is more than acceptable is. I'm just saying that it sounds 
to me that it's possible to push it up by another 100. When you get into 
uberwear, you could probably push it up by at least another 100 on top 
of that

True. I mean items obtainable at 35. Here's the full list, if it doesn't 
bore you:
orc fang earrings
jaded/fire opal rings (same ac)
Ulthork collar
pariah mask
froglok crown
gem encrusted gloves
shackle of steel
4 ac jeweller made bracer (with some fire resist, I think)
azure sleeves
cured tizmak surcoat
gatorscale pants
FBSS
cured slippers
CoS

Growth. Even some of the stuff from Fear is better than what I have on 
(I think). Growth stuff has quite a bit more ac than my stuff, with 
exception of headband and sleeves

> What Kunark stuff?

Fungi tunic, epic gloves, robe of whistling fists, haste cloak, 
meditative blanket, tattered mantle. 
There was some mask from Howling Stones, and more stuff that I don't 
remember names of :)

Unfortunately I didn't say I can. I could, possibly, if I was in a guild 
that goes to planes, and if I was playing in large enough chunks of time

Of course. Hitpoints are very important for when complete heal is 
around. But if you take less damage per second than a warrior, than even 
with lower hitpoints you can be a vialbe choice. Lack of taunt kinda 
does suck. There are ways around it, although I'll admit that all of 
them are very half-assed compared to real taunt
