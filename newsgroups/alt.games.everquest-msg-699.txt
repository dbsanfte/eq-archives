I few weeks ago, my friends that I usually play with on weekend and I decided
to make a hybrid group.  A ranger (me), a SK, and a Pally.  I'm real interested
to see what these changes will do for our group.

It makes for interesting role-play.  The SK and Pally are brothers that took
different paths in life.  The fun part is that they are also brothers in RL.
I'm still wondering why Tunare would plague me with a Human SK and
make constant muttering about such in game.  Great fun.
