Jaxan's jig o' vigor increases mana regen - FALSE

This is confirmed by verant that the apparent increase in mana regen is a
client side refresh issue. Jaxan's does not increase the amount of mana you
regen, but is DOES increase the number of times the little mana bar moves.
Bar moving more often is ONLY a visual increase in mana regen, you actually
regen the same amount of mana without the song, but because of the way it
interacts with the client, your mana bar is refreshed more often and APPEARS
to go up faster.

This has been confirmed by GZ and tested hundreds of times by bards
everywhere, but I STILL hear casters asking low level bards for the jig. FYI
the jig restores stamina.
