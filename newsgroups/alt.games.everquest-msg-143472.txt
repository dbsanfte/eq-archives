This is irrelevant, chanter haste stacks with item haste up to the cap, and you

aren't in any danger of reaching cap with swift like the wind and FBSS
or any item in a similar price range

SBOC is a nice item, which drops in Kael Drakkar (KC is Karnors Castle)
but fairly rarely.

Another idea would be to get Silver Chiten Hand Wraps, which drop quite
often in Velks Lab and are probably easy and cheap to buy.  This would
let you wear the sentry girdle, and you'd have AC on your haste item...
depending on your current gloves this may or may not be a sacrifice
of less AC than the FBSS.

As a warrior, you have three jobs: damage production (you aren't all
that good at this, but haste will help) aggro maintenance (more haste
means more swings and that means more aggro), and damage
absorption.  While AC is (maybe) important to damage absorption, you
can't absorb damage if you can't hold aggro... so you still need
haste to do that job.
