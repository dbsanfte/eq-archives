    Sol B is an amazingly buggy place. Being unable to see a party member is
one of the unique "features" of the zone. I've never had it happen in Sol A,
but I wouldn't be surprised if it did there, too. Zoning or camping fixes
the problem. Although sometimes if you camp in Sol B, you camp back in at
the Lavastorm zone-in - but that's a bug for another day!
