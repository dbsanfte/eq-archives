I spent all the way to 32 dead broke and lacking spells.

I started hunting HG for exp at 32, solo. (Tough but doable with KEI.
AEGO helps when things go wrong. Spam the magic debuff till it sticks,
then slow and DoT kite the buggar with your fully buffed pet taunt
off)

I now have good gear, all spells, next 2 spell levels, and money in
the bank. 
325pp is good, and not that easy to let go, but I also sometimes do
things like that on a whim. Most of the time it does not pay off. This
one made up for a LOT of them. ;-)
