Bah, necros run in.  They should be bound outside anyway, have invis to 
both live and dead, can feign, AND damn well better have an essance 
emerald on them.

How can they mezz if they have no mana?  Seriously.  If you're rezzing in 
a hot spot, I'm not sure I want to be waiting for a nekkid, 0mana chanter 
to rez.  And I take offense to your statement that chanter mezzes are 
better than bard mezzes.  They last longer, maybe, but other than level 56 
mobs, anything a chanter can mezz a bard can mezz too.

The main reason I get rezzed first and grab the clerics and a chanter is 
to help get the raid back moving again.  On our raids now we generally 
have 3 live clickers, and a camp-out cleric just to be safe, so I'm really 
singing so that we can get those Aegos cast faster.  
With Luclin I have recently found myself in a group wipeout without a 
clicker, was damn annoying, actually had time to go make a pot of coffee 
while we recovered.  

I realized that I'm just way to used to effecient groups when I tried to 
get a pickup group moved to the Village in Velks last night.  Died due to 
being puller, tank, CC, haster, slower, and manapump all at once, everyone 
had to run to zone and rez me there.  Then cleric wants to sit on his butt 
and med rather than fight back up to CE.  Die again when monk feigns near 
us, I grab one mob, ask if he wants other, he says yeah, and then doesn't 
taunt it off me.  I get stuck in a crack, and watch as this uberguild, 
Baroness been 60 for 12 months monk can't taunt a gargoyle off of me.  Ask 
for heal, cleric says, oh, I replaced that with rez, not loaded.  I said, 
well, guess you get to use it again.  (In his defense he did say that he 
hadn't played in a year until that night, and he did get much better with 
some coaching.)  Luckily we snagged a warrior who convinced the rest of 
the group that rezzing me right there wasn't going to lead to instant 
death.  I guess if you only do pick-up groups you just don't expect that 
if you die, you need to consent someone so they can drag your corpse to 
the next convenient spot to click you and keep going.
