While the window could be larger, I think the scrolling issue has more
to do with it being curved.  It also is not a "window" in the sense the
old one is.  The old one will respond to page down, etc, the new one
does not.  The autoplay feature is kind of a joke, but a  nice attempt. 
I think they want to be sure we read the Eula each time, so we have to
go threw the whole thing, don't see why they can't have us "remember"
our password, and actually put the Eula in at character select or
something, but not being a programmer, this might be harder than it
seems.

I definitely like the estimated time, but still the patcher seems slow,
I wish there were more of a way to tell when it isn't responding, but
the original is no better for that really.
