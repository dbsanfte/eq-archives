I have a bunch of hotkeys on my mage that incorporate /stand -
It's very hard to tell while in elemental form if you're standing
or sitting, and it's deadly in dungeons to be sitting when you
hit /pet attack.

So I have
/pause 1, /assist bosra
/stand
/pet kill

and 
/pause 1, /assist bosra
/stand
/cast 5
/cast 5
/cast 5

(malosinia)

and the sit hotkey is
/stand
/sit

in order to insure it actually sits.

There's also
/pause 1, /rt
/stand
/cast 7
/cast 7
/cast 7

(mod rods)

(BTW - if it's not apparent, these are for botting my mage in
conjunction with my BL)
