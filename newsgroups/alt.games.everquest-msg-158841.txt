I don't know how you could possibly confirm it, offhand.  Wait, sure I can.

Go to WC, use sit aggro to get a puma on you, and then have a warrior buddy taunt it
off.  Repeat this a few times to get an idea how hard it is to do so.  Now put on a DS.
Repeat the exercise.  Try it after a couple rounds, try it again after longer periods of
time.  Perhaps Taunt isn't the ideal plan, hmm, no, have your buddy hit on it with a low
damage weapon instead, while you stand there and do nothing.

Personally I'm firmly convinced that there will be no difference at all.  As far as I've
ever been able to determine, DS damage is "unattributed" which means the mob doesn't
know where its coming from.  This is why its an excellent PLing tool; the person who
cast it isn't counted as doing any damage.  But it requires care in use, because the
person being hit (and thus you might think doing the DS damage) isn't counted either.  A
mob that has 200 hp and takes it all from DS damage gives noone exp (even if the DS
caster is of a level to get exp off that mob).  If the victim does 1 point, and the DS
does 199 points, then the victim gets the exp.  If the victim does 9 points, the caster
does 10 points (say with one of those funky roots that do damage) and the DS does 181,
then the caster gets the exp.  Its possible that the hate system does look at this
"unattributed" damage while the exp system does not, so doing some sort of direct test
is perhaps in order.... but its my belief that "unattributed" damage is just that, and
that a DS shield does not add hate to anyone.
