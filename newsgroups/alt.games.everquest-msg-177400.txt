Tough choice.  Either Luclin for the Bazaar and a few nice zones plus
the (very limited in comparison to PoP) added mobility of the spires
connection to Nexus, or Planes of Power (PoP) for the Plane of Knowledge
with its incredible mobility enhancement.  Bravely inferring that you
have not been playing too long and have fairly low level characters,
I'd lean towards Luclin while recommending that you budget for PoP in
the near future.  Velious can wait.
