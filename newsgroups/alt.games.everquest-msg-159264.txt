Once upon a time in the Land of Norrath . . . anyway. It used to be that
ceratin mobs dropped a lot more plat than they do now and they were around
for a very long time. BB Dwarves used to drop weapons worth 20 - 30 plat and
Hill Giants used to drop more and more plat consitantly. That was changed,
nerfed if you will. And the easy sources of lots of plat dried up. Those who
had a lot of plat still had it, but those who didn't had a much harder time
acquiring it. Consequently plat became more valuable and where you once saw
'trade only' deals you began to see 'plat only' deals.

At least this is the way I remember it.
