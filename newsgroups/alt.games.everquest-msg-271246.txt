No, I don't think you are old and inflexible. The game has a reputation 
for this, although once the nut is cracked by the persistent ones I hear 
they often really like it.

I am going to dive in with my best friend and give it a go at his house 
next week while he's off for the holidays. He's got two PCs sitting next 
to each other for us to play on so that should be good fun. Here's 
hoping two heads are better than one.

There is an online strategy guide for the game available at Gamespot.com 
I know which you can peruse here:

http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/guides/pc/anarchyonline/index.html

I haven't read it over yet but it probably isn't much help when it comes 
to the interface. I doubt I am going to read much at all ahead except I 
do want to read about character creation and hopefully make toons I'll 
like the first try as a result.

I assume you've looked over the manual and other info available at the 
Funcom Anarchy Online Website. It might help to make up and print out a 
cheat sheet of survival commands, etc. I was thinking of doing that 
myself to help minimize the initial confusion when I enter the world for 
the first time.

Other than that all I can say is don't give up too soon. I've read in 
the thread here about AO that it does get easier if you keep at it for a 
few days.
