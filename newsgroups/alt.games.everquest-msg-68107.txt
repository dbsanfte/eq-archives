It's not that difficult to max casting skill outside of a group or hunt
situation.   Simply find an isolated spot -- the zone wall between the
EC tunnel and Freeport is ideal if EC is your auction zone -- and
chain-cast spells until they max.   A macro to do that is very simple:

/target <self>
/pause 40, /cast 1 (level 1 dd)
/pause 30, /cast 2 (level 1 heal)
/pause 30, /cast 3 (True North)
/pause 30, /cast 4 (level 1 buff)

You may have to mess with the /pause commands, but that raises
Evocation, Alteration, Divination, and Abjuration and only costs 39
mana.   Simply casting Summon Food and Summon Water every time
you play will max out Conjuration eventually.

You can do that and /auction anything you have to sell at the same
time.   It has the added bonus of usually having an enchanter around
to give you a Clarity so you can do this pretty much non-stop.  Since
I find selling items mind-numbingly boring anyway, this at least gave
me something to do until my skills hit maximum.   Now I've got to
find some other way to pass the time, which probably explains why
by bank has about 5k worth of items in it while I've only got about 1kpp
in the bank.
