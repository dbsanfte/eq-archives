I know Faerie in addition to a bunch of others. The ones I am really
looking for help in mastering are goblin, Froglok and orc. Most of the
other obscure ones I've already mastered.

I do have a friend who has mastered all of them.

I think, but am not 100% sure, that there is a quest given by the Faerie
to young paladins. I think speaking their language helps.
