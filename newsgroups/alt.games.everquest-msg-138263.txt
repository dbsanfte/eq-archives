Cause dying from falling from landing on top of someone else at a 
porting are a bug, and because falling for 10K are normally bug related. 
And theres a LOT less chance of a GM being able to help with nooone 
showing up on a /who all GM than if someone DO show up on list.

And yes, i made a mistake, thats exactly why im posting it here, so 
people do NOT make that mistake i did, not bitching about stoopid GMS 
not rezzing me after i waited XXX hours. Know i made a mistake, and if a 
GM had been on, i would have tried to petition and see if it WERE 
something that warrant a GM rez, or not. Instead, i choose to get a rez, 
since i didnt see any reason for spending hours waiting for a GM to log 
on to maybe being able to get a rez.
