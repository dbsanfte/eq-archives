I didn't read it that way, but can definitely understand the sentiment.
Now, of course, Necros have to research more than any of the other INT
casters with Katta vendors having many of the research spells (for the non
necros, that is).

Research doesn't bother me so much if the words drop enough that you can
have them available by the time you need them.  It actually helps the poor
casters a bit in that the spell is (essentially) free.  Also, we now have a
real use for the Research skill.
