Been there, done that.
Surprisingly enough, DB doesn't seem to make as big of an impact after
you've gotten some decent weapons in hands of your meleers.  

First Vulak kill, 24 mins.  4 DB wizards.
Second Vulak kill, 22 mins.  4 DB wizards.
Third Vulak kill, 29 mins.  2 DB wizards.
Fourth Vulak kill, *39* mins.  *4* DB wizards.  <-- This was a VERY
weird night.

I'm gonna track our Vulak kills some more, but outside of the fourth
warder, I don't think DB wizards are as big of a factor anymore.

Gating Hoshkar?

Hehe, if Hoshkar won't come to the mountain, we go drop the fucking
mountain on that stupid dragon's head.  :)
