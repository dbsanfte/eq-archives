What race did you make your rogue? would help to know for focusing on your
stats, if you went wood elf or dark elf or other low str race you might
really want to pump up str a good bit, I found with my rogue (dark elf) it
was a serious pain to raise even with snagging every piece of gear that had
good str on it I could find. Sta I just focused on getting over the 100
mark.. going to have low  hp anyways and if your tanking something isn't
right ;) Agi and Dex I tried to keep somewhat even, and had both hovering
around the 120 mark (not fantastic but was decent).
All the skills are implemented, one not listed is a real hidden gem if your
new to the game, evade.. a must have, make yourself a hotkey

/attack off
/doability 1 (or whereever you have hide)
/pause
/attack on

will help if you get agro to switch the agro back to the tank, relies on
your hide skill so keep that pumped.

Off to grab my morning coffee, sorry if this makes no sense lol =)
