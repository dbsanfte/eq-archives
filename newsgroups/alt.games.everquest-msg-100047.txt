Or even worse, only some spawns of the same mob summon; like Nezekesomething
in Burning Woods.
If I happen to see it when I pass from DL to Chardok I usually chain-pet it
(rare drop is an epic piece for me). 2 times no prob, but the third time I
ran into it it all of a sudden started summoning me. Had to disrupt the
exp-group of guildies in Chardok to help me with CR and rez :(
