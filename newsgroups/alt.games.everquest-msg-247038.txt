Warriors level (or used to level) a little faster than other classes.
Five percent faster as I recall.  You could group sooner to account
for this difference so the shaman isn't being held back.

Parrying is using a weapon to deflect an attack.
Riposte is using the weapon to not only deflect an incoming attack but
counterattack in the same move.

My 62 warrior has a commonly dropped dagger I picked up in an LDoN,
but I think it has a recomended level.  It's been so long since I have
played my warrior though, and so many new weapons have come out, that
I have no recommendations. These days, you certainly don't want to use
a velium rapier like he did at that level.

Large races can Slam, instead of Bash, without using a shield.  It's
the same skill.  Slam and bash and Kick all use the same timer, so
it's easy to just use kick.  If you aren't a large race, you can put
your secondary slot and an inventory slot in the hot keys so you can
equip a shield, bash, and re-equip a weapon quickly when it is really
important to stun the mob.
