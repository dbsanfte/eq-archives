I just started an Ogre SK as my first melee character and
I have a few questions about 1hs vs 2hs-

I guess my main question is this:  I can see the benefit
of 1hs + shield (higher AC, plus bash), and I suppose the
main reason for 2hs is higher dps?  Is one better in certain
circumstances than others (like solo vs group, main tank vs.
secondary tank)?  Also, what about piercing?  Is it worth the
effort to keep this up?  1hb? 2hb?  At this low level it seems
like keeping all of those skills up is going to take a huge
amount of effort- is it worth it?

Any pointers or links to good guides would be helpful-
