Not really.  I read an article a couple years back (about the time of 
that Republic vote thing) that said the Australian government had 
instituted a system of licensing journalists in order to cut down on 
defamation and increase the quality of news or some such nonsense.  It 
was barely any more than a side note, and I can't seem to find reference 
to it.  That's why I asked.
