Is certainly difficult at times.

Got in a chardok group with some
lowbies (heh, usually I"m the lowbie,
even at 59... well these guys were
in the sub 55 area) including a bard
and no chanter.

Bard was actually decent mezzer, although
he never charmed a thing, is that common?
Seems to me charm is a great form of
crowd control, lets you make one add off
tank another add, while you mez a third
and fourth. I didn't say anything, though.  Heck,
maybe its not even true anymore at 50+

Bard was twisting percussion songs, no
drum.  Strings songs, no strings.  Wasn't using
any of the strings only lines, not ever.  Had
weapons in hand, and niether that handy
note spamming epic, either.  I didn't say
anything (well almost.  I -did- ask if Sword
Dancing was a percussion song... after noticing
that it was boosting my dex by a pitiful 34 points
or so)

On the occaisions where I'd be LOM, bard was...
still twisting melee songs and weilding weapons.
I know that in the long run mana while waiting
for next pull, melee songs during fight, works best,
but there comes a point where I think I can
expect a twist of cantata isn't there?  I didn't ask,
so I can't say for sure.

We lived. Our kill rate was decent if not anything
to write home about.  So I didn't say anything.
But am I wrong about  what was going on?
