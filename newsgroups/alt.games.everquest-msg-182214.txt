Blessed Armor of the Risen.

Basically it's an upgrade to the self-only AC/HP buff line; more AC,
more HP, and *six points of mana regen*. There's also a very rare level
60 spell with an extra point of regen (7 rather than 6) and another
level 65 spell with 8 points. But BAotR isn't too uncommon, usually
selling in the Bazaar for around 500-800 plat, and gives you most of
the benefits, at an earlier level.

It's *the* reason to hit level 58, in much the same way as Aego is the
reason to hit 60 and the 96 rez is the reason to hit 56. (Though 56
also has the proccing hammer and Yaulp V...)
