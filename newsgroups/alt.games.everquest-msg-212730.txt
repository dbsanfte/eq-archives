In their ongoing attempts to make EQ *less* fun to play, some time back Sony
has nerfed what used to be the 'trivial' level of a tradeskill. It used to
be that once you increased your trade skill past a certain point you no
longer increased your skill in making an item but you also had a much lower
failure rate. Now once you reach that level, you no longer increase skill
but failure rates are still high.

How much past 'trivial' do you have to increase your trade skill for an item
to significantly lower failure rates? I increased jewelry to 120 but am
still losing lots of gems when trying to lacquer them. I'm wondering how far
I have to go to prevent this and whether it is worth spending the money
since I'm not interested in going to GM jewerly but I just use it in
pottery.
