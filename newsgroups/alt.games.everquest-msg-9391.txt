I am lvl 5 human ranger, and an eq newbie to boot.  my problem is that
any of the creatures that i suppose (i suppose because they always kill
me so i never get to see their loot) have lots of money for me to loot
are too high and i get waxed within a few seconds.  so i have been
resigned to killing low level knolls & firebeetles to make a few coppers
or silvers at a time.  does anyone know if there are there any quests a
low level ranger can do and get paid a good amount of money, like maybe
platinum. the few quests (in Qeynos area) i've found have gotten me only
2 to 3 coppers and or silvers,  OR does anyone know of an area where low
level creatures give a better return than 1 to 2 silvers.

thanks in advance for your replies, any other advice on being a low
level char, very well appreciated.
