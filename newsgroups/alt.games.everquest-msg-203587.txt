Before shelling out cash, look at cooling. I would suspect that the load on
your processor has increased with XP and early AMD chips were notorius for
overheating. Upgrade your processor fan and make sure you have good contact
with heat conducting resin goop. make sure there is good ventilation around
your PC also.
