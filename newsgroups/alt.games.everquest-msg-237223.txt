	If god doesn't have complete knowledge of the past, present and future,
then he lacks the context necessary to warrant handing out infinite
punishment.

	Of course, that's begging the question that anyone at all deserves
infinite punishment.  If Hitler were given 1,000,000 years in hell for every
life he caused to end prematurely, no matter how indirectly, it would still be
as nothing compared to eternity.

	If god doesn't know the future, how can he know that his plan for creation
is best?  He can't -- he'd be fallible, he could be wrong.
