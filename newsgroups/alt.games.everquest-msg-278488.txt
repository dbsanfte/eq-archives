Mistmoore Castle. Work your way in to the castle and possibly get 2 nameds 
on the way.
Things to watch for though, pathing is a little crazy but once you work it 
out you should be fine.
Also I notice you lack a snarer. I can't remember anything running, but if 
it did you could have problems.
Fun - definitely, Loot - MM has been revamped and even without nameds you 
should do fine for PP. XP - insane.
HTH.
