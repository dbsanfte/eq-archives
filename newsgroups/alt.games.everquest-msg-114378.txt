I am just level 31chanter. Have the key from Unrest (Priest of
Najena). Now need to get it to Linara in jail cells in Najena. Never
been there before. I have the map.  Would going in wolf form or invis
to undead or as water/earth elemental allow me to go through
un-aggro'd?  What is best strategy for a quick in, quick out?
