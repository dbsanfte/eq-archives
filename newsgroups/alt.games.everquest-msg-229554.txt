I hate the web sometimes. :) Full o' crap.

"Going South"
He had it right when he mentioned the maps.

Its really simple:
South is Down, by cartographic convention.
Death is Down, ("6 feet under")

To go south is to die. QED

That load of speculation about slaves and civil wars is pretty much 
unfounded.

"Going west"
He had it right here too... the sun.
Its really simple too:
The day is classic metaphor for life, and the suns traversal of the sky 
is a classic metaphor for the phases of life... "e.g. He's in his sunset 
years"... to have "gone west" is to have reached the end of ones journey.

Again that load of speculation about pioneers and prisoners etc was 
pretty much unfounded.

Why is "going south" taking over from "going west"... who knows. 
Personally I think "going south" is more visceral, sudden, and 
immediate, while I view "going west" as more of a natural 
occurence...owing to the metaphors gradual inevitability ... but maybe 
that's just me.
