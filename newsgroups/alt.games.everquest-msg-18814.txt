Any help on fletching would be appreciated.  I have checked out the main EQ
websites and can't find a few answers.  

1.  What are the exact combination of components needed in a fletching kit to
make arrows/bows?

2.  A bundle of shafts has four in it, do you need 4 nooks,tip, etc. as well or
just one?

Thanks
