Whilst you are stupid enough that I shouldn't even bother replying since it
will be so pointless, I'm going to anyway.  Do you even know what 'bullshit'
means??  I am giving him the straight facts on why it's stupid to start
talking about the true bullshit that would be a lawsuit.  It's also true
that he should cancel his account, and that everyone else who doesn't like
it should cancel theirs.  I don't give a shit if people on a UO board said
it, or how 'ironic' it is, it's still true.  I also couldn't give a damn
whether he stays or goes; I'm not telling him to leave, just that as Verant
has the right to do whatever they want with their customer's accounts, he
has the right to cancel.  Go away!
