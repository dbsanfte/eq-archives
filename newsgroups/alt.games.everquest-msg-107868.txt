I agree, this spell is quite mana expensive and of questionable worth at
best (its just not very much AC really) but quite useless on the low
AC, not supposed to get hit casters.  On the MA, where a reduction
in damage of a few hit points per blow might eventually add up, sure,
but its less and less likely to mean anything on people who A) aren't
supposed to get hit much and B) don't have the HP to live long
enough to take enough blows for it to matter and C) probably have
an AC starting value so low that they might as well be naked for all
the good it will do ( I know this last one because I've been naked
on a CR and gotten hit by mobs no harder than the fully dressed
enchanter)
