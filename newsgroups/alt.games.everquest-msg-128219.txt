I used to work in retail... a major chain that treats its associates
like shit.  I won't name names, but it starts with "Sears, Roebuck,
and Company."

Anyway, I was in the computer department, and had to deal with total
fucking morons on a daily basis.

I can't claim it's happened to me personally, but it happened in our
department:  one day this welfare bitch comes into the store with her
18 kids and puts the PC on the counter, and it's CD-ROM tray next to
it, cracked and obviously yanked out of the case by her or her
heathen.

This is what she says, no joke:

	"My cup-holder is broken, I want a new computer."

All I can say is, thank God I wasn't there.  I think I would have
shoved the tray down her throat, and the rest of the PC up her fat
ass.
