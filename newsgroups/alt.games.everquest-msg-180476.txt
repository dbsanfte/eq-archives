Pardon me?  In OE you can search through the text of all downloaded messages
for a text string, such as "iksar".  Looking briefly at XNews which I just
installed, it appears to have a search feature to do a search on the
downloaded bodies of articles, although I have been unable to make it work
very well yet.  It can also do some other nifty server side searches, but
not on the bodies of the messages.
