    Most "real" casters would go a bit higher on the +resist/MANA thing. I
love the HP focus you have with the Earthweave. You lack focus items
big-time. So I'm aiming to: raise resists, raise +MANA/HPs, try to conserve
at worst and hopefully increase that INT, and get some useful level III foci
on you.

    Ok, things I'd suggest:

    The two earrings cannot stay. Some possible replacements include Glassy
Frog Eye, Sinew Tied Bone Earring, Earring of the Solstice, Crashing Wave
Earring, even the Electrified Earring of Tempests if you make up the INT
elsewhere (and you should). Lots of stuff you could camp or purchase for a
few K in that list.

    Face must, must, must, MUST be changed to an Enshrouded Veil. You Need
Summoning Efficiency III. Accept no substitutes.

    Your hat makes baby Brell cry. Ice Silk Cap, Bubonian Bandage Turban, a
Thurg silk hat MQ, Artkeeper's Mithril Coif (tradeskill-made HIE stuff), all
beat that thing you have now. A Helm of Nocturnal Phantasms would be perfect
if you could stand farming Nightmare-B for the Ivory Skull.

    The 5 INT ring has to go, it's so last expansion! If you're serious
about the mage, spend some more serious coin here and get a Ring of
Lightning (the Tormax ring) for Summoning Haste III. Summoning Haste III is
very important - see the other post in this thread about pet cannibalizing.
If you can't/won't swing that then Diamond Wedding Band, Ring of Winter (the
Dain ring), and Signet of Withering Flesh are all significant improvements
over what you have.

    Wrists: one of your wrists is usually your summoned damage focus, so
I'll look at what the other wrist should be. You don't need Extended Range
II, and you can always swap in the Reclaim bracer for the damage bracer
should you need to do that. Some items you may wish to consider include the
Supple Scale Armband, Artkeeper's Mithril Bracer, Cazicite Diamond Bracelet
(rare as hen's teeth, but if you get the pieces for it anyways be aware of
it), Wristband of Strategy, Bracelet of Comprehension. Even if you don't
want a Supple Scale armband for keeps, it might be a good idea to pick one
up as a swap-in ERange item for when your bolts aren't an option.

    For INT casters that aren't in the elemental planes, the arm slot is a
really bad slot. The PoP tailored sleeves, at any level from Nightmare up,
beat what you have now. Do some poking around and see what you can put
together. If you get the materials for another Earthweave combine, make it
sleeves.

    Don't try and upgrade your robe for now. Really, the velious quest robes
have solid stats, especially when it comes to resists. You'll get more bang
for the buck elsewhere.

    You leave the house in that cloak?!? Hello, Hiero! There's other
options, too. Dain cloak has Spell Haste III on it, which you currently
lack. If you have the cash and want to get two of those wrists I listed, you
could get a White Dragonscale Cloak and have a permanent ID III item.
There's also the Justice Cape, Cloak of the Wise, Cape of the Hatebringer,
and Dull Metallic Cloak.

    A Cartographer's Quill would be a showy upgrade for the staff (it's the
green, sparking orb thing). Otherwise, fine as is.

    Offhand is OK, but lacks a lot of the secondary stuff like HPs and
resists. Tactician's Bulwark, OotIV, War Magus' Arrow Guard, Shield of the
Ebon Hand (very rare, but Summoning Haste IV), might even look at the Dream
Weaver Webshield.

    That ranged slot item you have was passe when dinosaurs ruled the Earth.
Fluted Scorpion Stinger, all the way.

    I also don't see any stat-enhancing food or drink here. Misty Thicket
Picnics and Kaladim Constitutionals make a very good combination, and
they're always for sale in The Bazaar.

    James
