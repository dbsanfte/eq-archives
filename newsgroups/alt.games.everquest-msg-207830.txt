He said he wasn't twisting, just singing DDD.  So SoW would have speeded 
him up, not slowed him down.

And a smart bard loves SoW; run faster than mobs without giving up a 
quarter (ok for the non demigods, a third, and for the rock stars that 
can manage a 5 twist, only a fifth) of their song output to twist 
selos?  Sign me up!

If you think SoW is slow, you'll cringe when I tell you I spent most of 
my leveling life on TBoots, and only stopped using them continuously 
when I got Run 2.  Not Run 3, Run 2, yes, slower even than TBoots, but 
still faster than mobs and it never ever runs out.  And by the time I 
got Run, I already had access to the vastly superior 2 minute selos, 
which meant I wasn't giving up a significant portion of my twist output 
to sing it... but I still had to MEM it, and if you think I want to 
throw away 1/8th of my play list in order to run vastly faster than mobs 
instead of only trifflingly faster, you have another think coming.

With the recent changes to song memming, I might be interested, just 
click a list to swap in selos and click another to swap it back out, 
instead of having to open book and manually drop and drag the songs 
around...

But the fact is, I'd have to stop moving, and there are times when I 
literally don't stop moving for 15 minutes at a stretch.  Pause every 
two minutes to refresh selos?  Not on your life (or mine, I'd be dead if 
I stopped running with 10 POP mobs on my kitty tail)

No, faster than mobs is plenty, and it sounds like our hero had found a 
place where he was faster than mobs without any aid at all, by using 
(some would say exploiting) their pathing algorithm.  My guess would be 
that the pathing was improved in the recent patch and thats the change 
he's noticed.  Get him a SoW and he's back in business.
