True. I'm looking for a zone with low-risk XP, since i really don't want 
to die in a penalty level, and North Karana has pretty much greened out 
on me. So far, my experience of fear-kiting panda cubs in Stonebrunt has 
been mostly positive. =)

One question, though... What faction level with the Kejekans will make me 
non-KOS in Wolf Form? I find that wolf form makes me indifferent to 
Granitebacks, which is nice for add control purposes, but having to dodge 
every Kerran I come across is tedious.
