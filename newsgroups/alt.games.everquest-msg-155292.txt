I am finally beginning to accumulate some PP and went to the bazaar to find
new clothes.
A number of items I looked at had 'effects' with weird and vague names (no,
don't ask me to remember them, but they had to do with enhancements, sheets
of flame, lightening, etc).

Is there a good source for a list of all effects and what they really do?
