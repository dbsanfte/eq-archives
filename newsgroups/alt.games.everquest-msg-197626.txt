I wouldn't have thought the number of people in a particular guild with 
the best equipment to be that now normally. That *does* make a 
difference, I suppose. Btw, I *do* listen. That particular little fact is 
one that hasn't necessarily been thrown at me yet.

What was he doing when Dearic was getting his? Seriously. I'm curious.

That is assuming that Dearic, in this example, is the *only* tank in that 
guild to have received such uber gear? Hmm. I suppose it's possible.

So you're saying that the only people who have been flagged to date did 
so with the help of at least some players level 62+ with the uberest of 
gear? I really would like to know if this is the case.

Again, if all of the people who have been flagged were only able to do so 
with 62+ group members with the very best gear, I would really like to 
know. *That* would be irrefutable proof that it can't be done unless 
those circumstances existed, and I could accept that. I just can't help 
but think there have been people flagged with lesser advantages.

I really am not wanting to be difficult here, believe it or not. I merely 
see aspects to the whole situation that don't add up compared to what I 
understand. Is it enough for someone who has been there to just say, 
"That's the way it is. Shut up about it."? Nope. Sorry. Never has been 
for me anyway. All I require is a dispelling of my various points of 
issue. Telling me that I should just take people's word for it is all 
well and good, but it leaves me wondering.

I've done a fairly thorough job of stating where I find gray areas in the 
situation. If it is true about the fact that it *does*, in fact, require 
the very top end gear to tank the trials, well, that's the kind of proof 
I'm looking for. That would be hard solid fact. Telling me that people 
don't want to do this or people leave the guild for that is usually 
hearsay at best and leaves me wondering if it was truly because of the 
impossibility of the task at hand or maybe, just maybe, they *didn't* 
have the stick-to-it-iveness needed. Maybe, as much as some people want 
to believe otherwise, too many of the members of a particular guild were 
*not* committed to the guild as they should have been. You think you know 
some guild mates and the can prove you wrong in a second sometimes. 
That's all kind of a secondary issue anyway. The main problem is why is 
it supposedly so difficult to get through the trials.

Those of you who I've worn to a frazzle in my quest here, I apologize. My 
intentions were good (yeah, I know, the road to Hell and all that...). I 
do appreciate all the helpful insight though.
