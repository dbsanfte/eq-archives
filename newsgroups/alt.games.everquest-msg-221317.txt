I don't think that was his point.  I think his point was more that some of
these changes have made the game less fun, even for the newbies.  For
example, one of the most fun nights I had in EQ was trying to get a level 2
from Qeynos to Freeport, with only the cloth map as my guide.  Now part of
that fun was because I'd only had the game a few days, and so everything was
fun, but I don't think that was all of it.

Someone starting as a newbie today in Qeynos, who decides to go to Freeport
for some reason, can just go through PoK.  Sure, they *could* try to run
there like I did, and so the changes don't take that away from them, but
it's unlikely it will ever occur to them that it might be fun, so they'll
take the PoK ports.

Or take run speed.  It used to be that camping jboots, while tedious, also
had some fun aspects.  There would typically be a few people seriously
camping the AC in SRo, and it would take a week or two to get him.  During
that time, you'd become familiar with the ecology of the zone, and also with
the other people doing the camp.  It was like a hunt and a stakeout, and
there was a thrill to it.  Now people can buy tboots, or get to 50 or 51
(whenever it is AA becomes available) and get runspeed 3.  Jboots now are
not important as a travel item--they are only important as an outdoor
instant cast buff protector, and that has greatly diminished the camp.  Now,
most times I've gone through SRo, no one is camping the AC.  That does make
it easier for someone who wants jboots now, but the camp is no longer a
social thing among several regular campers.  It's just not as fun.  (I think
they should restore jboots to their former status as an awesome travel item.
Perhaps make them instant cast SOW (so that their speed goes up as your
level goes up)).

Compare to, say, not having to look at the spellbook while medding.  Note
that very few people complain about that change, compared to people
complaining about, say, the ports.  That's because no one has great memories
of the fun they had staring at the damned book.
