The reason those zones are popular is because the EXP is so great there. 

I hunted in OT right when it was really starting to get popular, and it's
still a great zone to EXP in.

My monk stayed in LOIO for several levels.  Right now he's in FM.

But like someone else in this thread, I either brought my own group, or
soloed.
