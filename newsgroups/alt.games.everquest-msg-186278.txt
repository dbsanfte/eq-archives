Those are fine, when there's anybody *there*.  I switch between soloing 
and grouping on any new chars, depending on how social I feel that day 
(and how up to dealing with discussions that go like so:
cleric (standing and pulling and fighting): oom
me: so sit down
cleric: no I wanna fight
me: but you're a cleric
cleric: yeah but I like fighting
me: so make a tank
cleric: I have 5
me: so go play one
cleric: I made a cleric so I could play one
me: so sit down
~ad nauseum~)
Kurns and The Warrens are two of my favorite places to play - Kurns for 
soloing (non-running non-casting couldn't-get-lower-aggro-radius-if-
they-tried mobs? okay!), Warrens for torturing/faction work/to earn a 
few plat.  Crushbone I tried the other day, but it was vastly overcamped 
- still suffering from frogitis :p  I have to be careful who I take 
there, as well - I want to keep my DE faction on my rogue and 
(obviously) my necro.  Runnyeye - well, after the rather disastrous AGE 
group we had there, I've redoubled my efforts in staying the hell away 
;) and Upper Guk, hell no.  I like my live froggy faction, for obvious 
reasons.  Unrest - okay, but very dangerous.  A group of 3 got creamed 
by a yellow, and we were buffed to the gills when we went for him.  AGE 
also tried Sol A but I didn't like that much either.  Too many damn 
pulls too close together.  I suspect The Warrens would be the same, and 
to top it off, they always run to 20 of their cousins whenever they get 
low health >:(
