Keep trying, I'm betting you can get her to interrupt the series.  I'm
currently in an involuntary interruption of Sarah Douglass' series, as I
wait for the remainder of the books to arrive from Australia.  Currently

Australia) is available here in the US, so I had to order the rest from an
online bookstore in Australia.
