I disagree but I think it would be interesting to do something to make
travel the old fashioned way more interesting.

Suppose they added a item attribute: "FRAGILE". Fragile items can not be
placed in the bank or teleported (any teleport: book, spires, firepots,
gate, druid/wizard port, under 10th level death port). The items are
destroyed by the port (or, better, replaced with damaged versions that make
it obvious what happened).

Now add some quests that require fragile items to be moved from place to
place (fragile ale from Qeynos to Freeport, Kaldim to Thurgadin, or Cazic
Thule to ST for that matter).
