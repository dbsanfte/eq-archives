Based on a thread we had on this some time back, it seems that the
the AE dispells that are typical of dragon class mobs go top-down
always, while single target dispells (like the Cancel Magic line)
can hit anything but have a mild preference for top (I did some
testing of the single target dispells).  Also, afaik, this is the
way dispells have always worked.  Certainly the Cancel Magic line
has been "random" since Kaev was hunting in Unrest back before
Kunark was released, that damned Gnecro NPC on second floor once
dispelled the root he'd stuck to me (was below my buffs), thus
allowing my escape.
