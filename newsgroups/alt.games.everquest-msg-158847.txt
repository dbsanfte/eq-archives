Easy! If you get get stacks of shadeling silk, you can sell them at nexus
for a lot, even bone chips can be good. If you can get to the nexus by the
books of PoP you are laughing; otherwise maybe you can get a lift?

Bone chips sell for about 10 pp / stack on rodcet nife.

Shadeling silk in bulk is used for rallic packs.
