Not sure which you will need to go to, probably the evil ones.  They are
in South Ro, some DE merchants.  Keep both, you can turn both in for XP
& sell the stuff you get for cash.  The cash from the lightstones is
more than the stuff you get though, so you may decide to sell them
instead.  The greater lightstones however turn in and the stuff you get
is worth more.
