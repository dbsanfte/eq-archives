I have a bard named Luky Charms.  I did not name him after a cereal
(never even thought of there being a cereal of that name when I
named him, had it pointed out to me later when some one asked if I
was magically delicious, hehe).  Originally I was never going to
give "Luky" a last name.  But once he got his charm song and had his
fist couple hundred resists I began to feel like I was lucky if the
thing worked =).  So he got the last name charms for that reason
alone.  Is it a violation of the naming policy?  I guess it depends
on if you look at why the character was named Luky Charms and what
the name really is a representation of or if you put some other
definition to it.

How does that name hurt anyone or interfere with game play?  I see
names that may or may not go against the naming policy, and I never
even give them a second thought.  Why would I?  I am in EQ to relax
and enjoy myself.  The name of any character in game does not affect
that in the slightest.

My very good friend from Bosnia tells me that Americans are way to
uptight.  The more I read this newsgroup the more I think he is
right on that point.

No offense meant just my opinion for what it is worth.  And no I
will not complain if they make me change it some time.  I will
attempt to talk them out of it though.  Luky has a good reputation
that I endeavor to retain every time I play.
