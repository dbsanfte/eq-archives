Wrong again:  (1) Most melees managed to get a magic weapon of some
sort sometime between levels 10 and 14, it was generally considered
more important than armor (and those were the days when a smith could
make pp selling banded, I know because I did so).  (2) I've been
playing since July of '99, well before Kunark came out.  (3) My having
played EQ pre-Kunark is by no means a prerequisite for identifying the
stupidity at hand, your relentless illogic is sufficient of itself.
