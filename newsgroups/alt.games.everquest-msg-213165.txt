We went in there yesterday.  Took out Servitor of Luclin, wiped to Grieg
(RT got blinded while bringing him to the MT and it all went horribly bad)
but didn't have enough time for a second try.  (Servitor and Grieg seem
unchanged - there was a rumor of them having been beefed up but doesn't seem
to be the case - we went in to Servitor fight prepared for a Grieg-length
knockdown dragout, but the common comment in the cleric channel was "He's
already dead?")

It was pretty much as described.  The mobs don't hit awfully hard or have
a lot of HP at least by PoP standards.  There were a few drops that I believe
were new off semi-common mobs (fairly decent bard gloves being one we got two
of, as well as a pair of decent pants for dresswearers).

One thing to note: Lull line does not seem to work in here.  I got 5 success
messages from a Wake of Tranquility, but the whole pack of mobs came when the
closest one in the first room was pulled.
