/tongue in cheek
Yes, smacky is a technical term.  Smacky defines on a general level the
damage output of a mob in relation to a character's ability to absorb damage
modified by the available support.

For comparison, let's consider a paladin tanking Vindicator.
Level 50 paladin, no AAs, in Kunark gear tanking Vindicator?  WAAY smacky.
Lots of luck
Level 60 paladin, 10-20 AAs, in HoT gear tanking Vindicator?  Pretty smacky,
have a good healing chain.
Level 65 paladin, 200 AAs,  in Elemental gear tanking Vindicator?  Not
smacky at all.  Someone wake up the healers when it's time to roll on the BP
(probably for a twink).

From these examples it's plain that the Smackiness quotient (S) is derived
from the DPS of the mob (Dps) and the mobs' HP (Hp~m) factored against the
AC and HP of the tank (Ac and Hp~t, respectively), the level of Healing
available (Ch, for obvious reasons) and mitigating factors such as Slow
(Sl), Damages Shields (Ds), etc.  Due to the wide variety of variables,
exact calculations for Smackiness are widely disputed; however, it's
generally thought that healing classes have the best handle on estimating
mob Smackiness.  Indeed, it's the wise tank who listens when his cleric
tells him "Let's move over to a different camp, these mobs are too smacky."
