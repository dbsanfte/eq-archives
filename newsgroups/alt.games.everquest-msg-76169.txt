 Run speed is nice. Wizards seem to have it better when it comes to
damage dealing now. I'm seeing a lot of Critical Strikes for over 3k. As
far as melee goes, everyone seems to be getting Critical Hits these
days. Pretty spammy. Critical Heals are nice. AE buffing is a nice thing
as well. I haven't looked at all classes so I can't say if there's
anything pointless or silly out there. I'm sure there is.
