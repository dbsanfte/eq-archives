	Here's the current patch message on Test:

***************

May 27th, 2003
-------------------------

** Experience System Change - Grouping **

We've made some improvements to the way experience is rewarded in all of
EverQuest.  At its core, the idea is to positively reinforce grouping.  There
should never be any penalty to adding "that sixth person over there," whatever
class they may be, into your group.  That is exactly the type of behavior that
should be rewarded.

In a massively multi-player game, any mechanic that penalizes those who group
is one that we need to take a serious look at.  While there are definite
benefits to forming "well balanced" groups in terms of damage, tanking,
healing, and support, there shouldn't be an active penalty to those who cannot
find groups of "optimal" balance.

As it stands in EverQuest, groups gain a 2% to 20% experience bonus, which we
refer to as the "group bonus", for having two to six members.  In practice,
however, this has never been much of a bonus, even in the case of a full
group, given that the experience was already being divided six ways.

In the past, we had also attempted to reward people for adventuring in the
more challenging Planes of Power zones by making those zones give a better
rate of experience.

As of this update, groups now gain 20% to 80% "group bonus" experience for
having two to five members.  

Full, six-person, groups now see an additional bonus.  Their experience is
only divided five ways, yet they still gain the 80% "group bonus."  For those
who think in terms of pie charts, it amounts to a larger piece of a larger
pie.

Accordingly, the bonus inherent to Planes of Power zones will be decreased
slightly.  However, as long as person is grouped with at least one other, they
will see an improvement in experience gain over the old system.  The one down
side to the new system is that there will be a slight decrease in experience
for those who do not group, and only for those who do so in Planes of Power
zones.

We realize that we are, essentially, "manufacturing" a new type of experience
after a kill.  As players, we also understand it is the people who spend time
in full groups who have to deal with the most interruptions and setup time
caused by organizing the extra people.  It simply makes sense to reward that
extra time, especially if it means bringing more people together.  After all,
that's the whole point.

We look forward to seeing how these changes play out on Test Server.


** Experience System Change - Level 60+ **

In addition to the above changes, we have increased the range of NPC levels
that give a person experience after they reach level 60.   The "blue to 65"
range has been increased as far as level 50, with the "light blue" range
extending to level 45.  The best benefits, however, are still for fighting
things around and above your level. 

The world of EverQuest, at this point in its history, is truly immense and
full of the best and most interesting content and visuals out there.  Ideally,
when a person logs on they should have a wide array of places in which to
adventure.  The addition of new content shouldn't entirely obsolete what
already exists.  Hopefully these changes will once again make that the case.

	My character on Test is only level 30 and solos all the time, so I can't
offer any first-hand testimony as to how the changes work yet.
