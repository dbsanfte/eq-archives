I need some advice for hunting in the Warrens, that will not cause me to
possibly level backwards.  So far, I've leveled about half a bubble
backwards, and am 3-4 blue away from de-leveling back to 11 (from 12).  I'd
REALLY like to avoid this from happening.  I'm being killed off by trains of
hard hitting green cons.  I think part of this is due to my cloth armor, and
low damage weapon, though decent one.  Its a snake fang, 5 DMG, 27 DEL.
That's a 5.4 ratio for DMG/DEL.  I'd like to buy a higher LV one instead, or
even if not, I REALLY NEED some better armor.
    Where is the best place to go to buy raw silk or something like that for
a DE Necro (NON twink, so can't afford few hundred pp kind of stuff or other
higher LV area armor)?  My main playing time is going to be just after
midnight Central time (1 AM Eastern/10PM Pacific), and up for about another
6 hours from then.
    Any other LV 12 general hunting advice?
    Also how many kobolds do I need to kill to get to apprehensive with
anyone in Erudin?  I'm dubious with the guards at the newbie zone (zone
leading to warrens).  I did take a faction hit from the death of a mercenary
at the druid ring in Tox.  They killed me, then while memorizing spells,
attacked me again, I ran, a LV60 Monk Iksar killed it, and I took a faction
hit, when all I did was suffer damage, no attack or defense of any kind.
Was this a bug?  I know mobs have done this, let them hit me, then someone
else kills them & I take faction hit (like they hit me, I let pet kill them,
get faction, but if pet engages & kills alone, no faction hit).  I still con
dubius to those same newbie area guards after this though.
