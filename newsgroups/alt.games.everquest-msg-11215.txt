The one I like best myself is a char capable of gating. He drops down the
well, drags the corpse to the well and all the way up on the small sand hill
there. You can then /corpse from the top of the well as long as you can see
your corpse. The gating char then gates back up.

I myself did this 3 times already for someone else. Just make sure the
gating char can take on a willo or two, as they are usually just behind it.
