Actually, I'd have agreed with you if Gnome SK's could
worship Innoruuk. :-)

One thing I do like is all of the mana my lil' twinkee has (he's not
"uber" twinked, just enough to get to 20 or so without problems).
I'll usually pull with Siphon STR (if STR has worn off), follow with
Disease Cloud, and then hit with Despair.  One thing I'd noticed
is that snakes/spiders don't "seem" to poison as often if you hit
'em with Despair's ATK debuff.  It's just anecdotal, though.

Yeah, I kinda figured.

Yeah...currently using a Blade of Xalgoz and a Centi SS to keep skills up.
I've got some crummy-but-fast 2hb/1hb/piercing weapons that I train fighting
other groups' mobs (with permission). Keeping a reliable "DoT" around is
always good.  I do lose the pet sometime when I get double pulls and switch
targets.  /pet back off and /pet attack don't always seem to work correctly,
and sometimes my lil' green pet ends up trying to solo a yellow con.
He doesn't last long...:-)

Yeah.  Not too worried about mez yet (I'll probably solo to 20 or so just to
go quicker), but thanks for the tip.

Conjouration is going up fine.  The only thing that worries me is my
Evocation skill later..not really a low-mana "practice" spell...and finding
willing undead to practice on over and over may be tough.  Can you
cast your anti-undead nukes on your pet (even if it doesn't affect him,
can you skill up that way?)?

Again with the DoTs.  Loud and clear.

Gotcha.
