It's been happening to a lot of people, including me. It started with
the last patch. An informal survey (/ooc Hey! Is anyone else going LD
when they ding and try to loot the corpse?) revealed more than half the
people in the zone I was in last time it happened are having the same
problem. Someone suggested disabling the sound; but I doubt that will
help seeing as mine has been disabled for some time to reduce lag. Don't
know what to tell you; but you are certainly not alone.
