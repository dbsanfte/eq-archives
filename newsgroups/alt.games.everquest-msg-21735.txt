You will not evade me, runen@netcom.no (Rune Ness):

Keeping everyone sowed is a good rule. It can be a matter of life or
death in cases such as being hit by sand giants/spectres in Oasis,
dragoons in Overthere, trains anywhere (whether your own or someone
else's) 
Stand their ground? Sometimes it's easier to try to put up a fight if
you know you will be able to outrun the mobs if things should turn too
bad, rather than running immediately.

Beware of using DoTs around an enchanter - dotted adds can't be
mezzed.

Like you said, a dr00d. I hope he went on whatever you use for a
never-help-in-any-way list.
