> > David... I honestly think you're mistaken.

Its entirely possible that the original article contained the quote but that
it was edited before making it to the magazine . Not at all unlikely that
the original article was posted to the web before being distributed in the
magazine. The on the web article I read did include the quote.

Now on the matter of the subject I think kelly was right mostly. A game
should be the singular vision of one person and should have at least some
isolation from the masses. I never disagreed with this I just found his
singular vision lacking in some very key areas. In other words I dont give a
damn even if he did say it :)
