One thing about the Burning Affliction change nobody's mentioned
(at least nobody that I've seen):  They reduced the minimum
duration limit form 36 seconds (6 ticks) to 30 seconds (5 ticks).
This is rather significant to Enchanters (at least lower level
Enchanters), because their DoTs last 5 ticks (IIRC, the first
Enchanter DoT longer than 5 ticks is at L44).  So, while they've
nerfed Necro/SK snares, and Druids like mine that often saw DoTs
go full extended duration even in groups, low level Enchanters
now have a new focus to play with (Affliction Efficiency and
Affliction Haste still have the 36 second min duration).
