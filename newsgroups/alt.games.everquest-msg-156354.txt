I think Im one of the lucky ones..   My first Naggy and Vox raids were
successfull and they were both pickup raids.
Now, my wife on the other hand has had Numerous nightmare raids.  
Wife's naggy raid had 5 TPW, and still did not take em down.  Oh and
she has an awesome Druid Raid wipeout (the nasty dragon in the ocean,
cant think of its name now)they had her and all casters bind at the
cave mouth....   can you say Spawn Sniper ,er oh yeah this isnt Unreal
Tournament...  Death Loop nightmare.  had to have a GM come help them
with thier CR.
