Unless you have a large lead on the quad, the odds are you will get
agro before harmony has a chance to finish casting. Your best bet is
to ensnare any adds and ignore them until the quad is finished. Once
you have finished the quad you may have to snare/root/med until you
have enough mana to deal with the add(s).
