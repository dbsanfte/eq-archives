yes i am

its a fucking stupid name

and to top it off it belonged to a female bard

go figure

you dont have fantasy settings where KARGOTH the Destroyer groups with KITTY

the character cause he/she happens to like cats

what's next, Puppy Dog?

or i know, maybe Gold Fish?

or how about Cuddly Hamster?
