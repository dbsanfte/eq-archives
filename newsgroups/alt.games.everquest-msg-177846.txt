    No matter how good your clerics are, they can't shorten the casting time
on CH. And at their level, that's what they're going to use - a CH chain.

    How do you tell you're number two on the hate list? Especially when
something as simple as standing a few steps closer can be the difference
between second and tenth on the hate list?

    Then I have no clue what you were doing wrong. When our monks use
voidance, they stay nimble tanking just fine until the disc drops. You are
continuing to attack, right? You aren't shouting for someone to taunt it off
you?

    Are you saying he hits you when feigned, or that he comes back for you
after you get up?
