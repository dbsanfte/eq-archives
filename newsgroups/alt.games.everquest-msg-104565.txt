Playing my enchanter, I like to pull and have someone draw the agro from me.
Sometimes they dont draw the agro fast enogh and I get to train some much
neeeded defense. Either way, I can keep the pulls coming fast with only
seconds between pulls, instead of sitting on my hands waiting for some half
asleep melee to work out its time to pull the next. I couldnt care less
about agro... just give me sow and all is fine. Druids (with snare) are one
of my favourite friends for keeping the lid on agro.
