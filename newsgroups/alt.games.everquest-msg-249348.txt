I think that was also partly due to the lack of soul binders. But yeah, 
people are truly lazy. It was ridiculous to see people in their 50s 
begging for ports from EC to SRo...

Maybe a (stackable) modestly expensive no drop stone that gets consumed 
when they get a GG (always free for the druid/wizard). That ensures 
they'll incur a cost when they ask to get ported around, and maybe cause 
them to think twice about it. There are other issues with that I 
suppose...in terms of raiding etc... but there are workarounds too... 
like making the GG component free if its 4 or more people...

I doubt it was that much faster unless you missed the spires *every* 
single time... you just felt busier :) On average you only had to wait 
around 7 minutes... it wasn't *that* bad. If it was me I'd have put them 
on a 10 minute timer, and i would have made it so that you could hail 
the spire-chick to get an exact time until the next firing...

And I knew about the gypsy camp... but even today there is no soul 
binder there... your playing craps if you gamble on finding somone to 
bind you on arrival. Plus the Karanas is a low enough zone that often 
even the casters can't bind on arrival. (Given that pre-PoK the spires 
was the best way to get your 7th level high elf wizard to westK...)
