That I find hard to believe.  The main problem being the failure rate as you
hit Gold and Platinum.  How much PP are you talking about?  I know a Chanter
that was Trivial in all Gold, and was working up in Platinum.  With full
gear and buffs to max INT and WIS, the failure rate was disgusting.  We are
talking about thousands of PP burned per skill level gained.  I don't have
the exact figures because this was someone else's toon.

Up to about 150 jeweler I was going strong.  Then things really slowed.  I
have 176 jeweler now.  I don't plan taking it up again till I get Insight at
L39.  If the failures are still too hard on my cash supply, L44 and
Brilliance should solve it.

Getting 176 jeweler has cost me somewhere between 4K and 5K plat.  From the
failure rate I now have, and looking at the cost of the gems, I could spend
the same 4k to 5k getting from where I am to 200.  That is why I want the
buffs.... well, with some gear I have recently gotten that may not longer be
true.  But after 200 I may be facing 1k losses every skill level.  I'd
really have to try to know since I have not heard any concrete data on the
subject.

That is why I doubt that you could get 5 L1s to that point.  Now, if you had
the help of a L44 + chanter, that would make a serious difference.

How much PP does it take to get a Shaman to 170 in alchemy?  Since there is
a level requirement, and 170 is the max, I know it will be a lot.  20k?
50k?  100k?  It would be interesting to find out.
