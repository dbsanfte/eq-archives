> Generic case with ADT 300 W PS (no hickups so far with it) $40

I've heard good things about the CompUSA cases, so I went with their tower
and 400w power supply. I'm running 1G of DDR sdram, which I am told sucks up
a lot of power. Although I paid over $100, the inside is very roomy (with
room for three case fans, none installed yet) and 400w should be sufficient.
Here's something interesting I observed: I use backup power supplies on all
my systems. I had an APC BackUps 350 servicing two systems for a while,
without problems. However, when I plug in my system and an older one, the
alarm rings and red light on the UPS rings. To me, that indicates that a lot
of power is being utilized.

I took a walk through CompUSA today and saw a 500w power supply on the
shelf, for $79. I'd probably be willing to consider buying a case without
power supply, and adding the 500w. Maybe I'll go that route with my next
system. In the good old days, you could use just about any power supply and
it wouldn't be a factor. Modern high performance system are much more
finicky about which power supply, memory, and other components. Nowadays, if
you skimp anywhere, you could be inviting problems.

Watch out for the longer IDE cables. In my case, the top drive bay (for cdr)
is far from the mb IDE connector . I bought two 36" cables, but neither
worked. A shorter cable fixed the problem, but just barely fit.
