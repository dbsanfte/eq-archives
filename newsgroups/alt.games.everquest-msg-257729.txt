You can accomplish the same thing eating a 'real death' with no rent 
items on your corpse. Is that an exploit too? Should SOE remove dying 
from the game? :p

With a 96% rez or even 100% rezes available in the game, removing 
dueling doesn't really affect this. If this is something soe considers 
an exploit they can check corpses for no rent items... it really has 
nothing to do with dueling.

Skillups and xp with minimal risk is very definition of powerleveling an 
uberbuffed twink. Is that an exploit too?
