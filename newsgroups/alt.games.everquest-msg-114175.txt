I have two machines, both run EQ:
P3 - 766 512 MB ram, Voodoo 5 5500- More than capable of running SoL. I have
some issues with the Luclin zones, but lowering the clip plane down, or, if
I'm going to be spending a lot of time around a lot of people, turning of
SoL models helps quite a bit. Not the best solution but as the hardware is
approaching a couple of years old now (except the memory, which I purchased
when SoL came out), I'm fairly satisfied with it's performance.
Athlon 1.4 Ghz, 512 MB DDR Ram. ATI Radeon 8500 - 64 MB(If the message
boards are to be believed I'm the only person in all of EQ with a Radeon
getting more than 10 fps. Stacked up next to a Geforce 4 I prefer the
appearance of mine Radeon. In heavy traffic (lots of people) FRAPS reports
about 40-70 fps generally)
If I was going 'better' than the above... more memory. I had to disable a
couple of Luclin models on the Athlon else it would hash the swap file a
lot.

Oh, if you are going to go with more than 512 MB of ram it would be a good
idea to look into using Win2k, Win XP, or Win Me, as Win 98 and 95 have
'issues' with >512 memory counts.

I'm using Win2k on my Athlon, it performs superbly in EQ. That would be my
OS recommendation.

The challenge level of DAoC is lower. They encourage grouping but it is much
easier to solo. (Their con system is similar to EQ: Purple(toe jam) Red,
orange, yellow, Blue (equal or lower) green, grey (don't bother, won't get
any xp) I have a friend with a 49th level berserker (think Monk with
weapons, or ranger without spells. Lots of offence, low defense) that
bitches cause he can 'Only solo Oranges'.
Much lower down time. Much of the action is faster (I've seen three pulls go
down quicker than single Drolvag's to a full mid 40s group in dreadlands).
Characters are not in any hurry to go anywhere (walk, with sprint that burns
endurance). Their version of SoW doesn't work if you're in combat mode or
have just dropped out of it.  Horses are a train system. RVR makes life
difficult on certain classes (You must have a healer, but healers get almost
no realm points, due to having to damage other pc's to get them... healing
doesn't do anything for you points wise. )
No trains in dungeons (monsters that are trained don't agro on others unless
attacked). Armor requires work to upkeep. so do weapons. Eventually you have
to replace items (they have two stats.. don't quote me on this but one is
like durability, the other toughness... durability controls how fast
toughness depletes. Toughness can be fixed durability can't, and slowly
wears down)
Both games are $12.95 per month now.

That's a summary. DAoC is not a bad game. It's not EQ though. I think I'll
stay here. Oh DAoC does not offer any support to VooDoo cards. forgot about
that one.
