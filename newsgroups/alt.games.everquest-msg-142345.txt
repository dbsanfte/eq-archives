DT,
	Are you really full of that much venom and spite... I have
attempted to tone down my conversation with you in an attempt to have
a conversation.  I did read... but I guess my slow wits took your
quote as a response to me ( your quote from Gucomics).  yes you quoted
someone else but used that quote to respond to me....  Hence my
thoughts that was your response...

I hope you remember a day when you were not quite so perfect, and did
not ever misunderstand a conversation, much less a conversation done
in text format, where you cannot elaborate at the time of a
misunderstanding.
	I still say you were bullish and rude by your first response
to me being sarcastic about the coming changes..  yes your response
that you say was not yours because you were quoting someone else...

eh... who cares right...  Ave a goot day..
