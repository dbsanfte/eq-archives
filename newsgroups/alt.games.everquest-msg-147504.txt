Well yes it is, it is totally against the EULA to share accounts and pretty
much says so on the opening screen you click AGREE to without even scrolling
down to read the rest.

The fact is it is done by a lot of people and Guilds, no one here treats it
with the same contempt that account trading gets but don't ever come looking
for pity if you share passwords and lose all your gear, you do it at your
own risk.
Which is why I said he shouldn't do it, he seems to trust someone "100%" but
is worried this person will get his CC Details (?!?) Sorry that isn't 100%.
Your personal finances are worth more than your EQ account so if you can't
trust him not to steal from you then you certainly can't trust him not screw
you EQ Account.
