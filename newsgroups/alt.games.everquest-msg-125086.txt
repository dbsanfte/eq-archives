He was singing Battlecry of the Vah Shir and Vilia's Chorus of
Celerity.  The first raises the haste cap, but I believe has no (or at
best a very small) haste effect of its own, and it stacks with
everything.  The second gives a substantial boost to haste.  (Some
bard please correct me if I've gotten any of this wrong).

Your reaction of "tell the bard to shut up" was about the same as that
of the ranger in question, who said "blame the bard."

You'll take off one of your own buffs when I can't land a heal on you
and not blame others or you're a prima donna who I for one will never
group with.
