hi,

sorry for posting so many (ot) help-my-box posts, but i don't know where
else to get good advice


today's issue, added to the ones before that are yet unsolved, is what to do
about a RealTek High Definition soundcard (onboard)...

i had it installed perfectly before, but since my most recent drive
scrubbing and windows reinstallation, i haven't been able to get it to
install correctly ... getting a code 10 ("device cannot start)" error in
device manager ... tried uninstalling and reinstalling a bunch, and used
drivers from the CD and drivers i downloaded from the RealTek website ... no
luck ...

and in task manager, "soundman.exe" is showing, but in system tray there's
no icon for sound properties


(thanks in advance)
