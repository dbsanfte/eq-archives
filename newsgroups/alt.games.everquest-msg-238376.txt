These days some providers news servers SUCK, & they get messages haphazardly
at best.  Threads dropped all over the place, specially when the thread is
more than a couple days old.  What I hate is when I read a reply does NOT
contain the original text & if I am interested in what the fuck they were
talking about I got to search for either the original post or someone that
was intelligent enough to include the original post in their reply..


>What kind of moron
> are you?  No insult intended.

Read the above paragraph.  You, the constant reader, are an asshole, & yea,
the insult is intended, as yours was.  Fucking prick.  I can believe how
much time you clowns waste criticizing how people post on the USENET.

> It will make it  easier to avoid the others like you in the future.

Killfile me please.   That way you can avoid me in the future.  As to others
"like me", your on your own, but I suggest you stop reading newsgroups
entirely.
