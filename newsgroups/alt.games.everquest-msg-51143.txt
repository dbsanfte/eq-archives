Friends,

In this type of situation, I like to ask myself "What would Jesus do?"

Now, I'm not a religious man. In fact, far from it - Atheist, tried
and true. But the man did make a certain measure of sense.

Did you get scammed? Probably.
Did you do the right thing? Absolutely.

Regardless of this guy's motivation, your good deed will come back to
you three fold.
