Why? I don't claim my spelling to be uniformly perfect. Better than a
rather large proportion of the internet, yeah, that comes with what I
do for a living, but not perfect. Nor am I flaming anyone else's
spelling.

(Though I laughed when yet another person joins the legions of others
here who have made a fool out of @ndrew the lying bigot... its getting
harder and harder to find someone who hasn't smacked him down at one
time or another)
