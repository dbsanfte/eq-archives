    Players used pathing one time too many, methinks. This is something I
never thought they'd fix on such a wide basis.

    Hey, the bards and SKs that pull most of PoP will hate it, too! =/

    I don't know that any general pathing change will get rid of "dead
spots". This is my understanding of how pathing works, correct me if I'm
wrong. The paths a given mob can follow are very fixed, and are a part of
the geometry of a zone. Changing pathing in a given spot requires a zone
rebuild and a re-download. This change is a change to the logic a mob uses
in deciding which path is the shortest path. As such, it shouldn't allow a
mob to path somewhere where there's no paths to begin with - the "dead
spots". I wish it would fix them, but I doubt it.
