Overclocking graphic cards was something done by Quake and Quake2 players
when chipsets didn't produce the blistering speeds they do now and 60fps in
Demo1 was considered good. It's still done nowadays by people that want to
get better 3Dmark figures. Given the performance of graphic cards today I'd
rather have a stable card than an unstable one that gets me 5 extra fps (5
extra on close to 200fps on a Q3 timedemo isn't really worth it)
Everquest, well, different kettle of fish. The graphic engine isn't that
efficient (ok, it's crap) and, since the DX7 patch, is now equally poor for
Glide as it is for D3D (before that it was "good" with 3dfx cards)

 I pretty much agree with everyone else (and I rarely run PC's at there
manufacturers recommended spec) the card isn't worth overclocking if EQ is
the game you're expecting the performance boost in, you are just not going
to notice the difference.

If you ARE still intending on doing it search for some overclocking sites
for Voodoo chipsets. The V3 (from memory) does not have a fan so get a
chipset cooler.
The blue orb is a good choice;

In fitting this you'll lose the use of PCI slot1 but then as the system has
a habit of sharing resources of AGP and the first PCI slot I'd not suggest
using that  slot for anything, anyway.
Also, you are likely to get a better performance out of o/c ing the memory
more than the core (I assume this utility lets you control both) see if you
can get hold of some small chip heatsinks (I got some from work that were
supplied to be used on the driver chips on a printer) I am not sure where
you might obtain these, try some overclocking NG's and forums.

You'll also want some heatsink paste or epoxy. Arctic silver is good (if not
the best)

Once you've got your card running at some warranty invalidating speed test
it with 3dmark2000 (don't bother with 2001 it was designed for Geforce2's
and above) you can loop the demo's so you can test if the card is stable,
leave it running the test, looped for 2hrs, if it hasn't hung, blue screened
or blacked out in that time, it's stable, time to up it's speed again and
repeat.

3DMark2000 available here;

Good luck.
