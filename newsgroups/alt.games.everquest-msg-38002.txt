If you're gonna group, I would recommend the Warrens themselves!  You can
get a group between 18 and 23 and continually be on the move, moving from
place to place, challenging new things.  I've done this before and its a
blast.

Go down right side, visit the Smith, the Cook, the Trainer, the Jailor, and
the Packmaster if he's there.  Then challenge the Prince.  After this,
regroup and go down the left side, challenging things in the King's room,
the Warlord, and even the High Priest and King himself if the group is
capable enough.

Then exit the back of the king's room to kill the Cavebat Lord, the Mighty
Bear Paw, and the Huntmaster Furgurl.

Kobolds in the Warrens seem slow, so if you aren't loaded down with coin and
loot, you can usually escape from deep in the dungeon (with a nice sized
train behind you of course).

I don't know how important it is to be safe however.  At level 18, I would
say you would earn more experience pushing the limits and dying once every 2
hours than being safe and not dying at all.
