Besides the bank (covered in other posts) you can do this at vendors:

Get your best faction and get your charisma over 105 if you can... or
as high as possible under that (stops mattering at 105)

Buy something, gems usually best.

Sell back to vendor.

Vendor will take money starting with coppers and working up only
when those run out.  So if you buy a 10pp item and you have
100pp 100gp 100 sp and 100cp, the vendor will take
89gp 100sp 100sp, which is 289 coins ( all coins weigh about the
same)
Given that you have best faction/cha, you will make back almost
all of that on a gem sale (other items have larger profit margins
for vendors)
so you will probably get roughly 9pp 8gp in return.

Some vendors take a smaller margin than others, even when you
have identicle faction and charisma.  Matching race may also help
but most of the time this seems to be an attribute of the vendors
themselves.

A third option is the "ATM" one.  There are people who make
a living by going to zones with lots of cash/heavy "sell to vendor"
item drops, and making change.  They will, for example, take
all your GP, SP, and CP and give you 90% value for it.  They
will also buy all those pesky brass weapons for 2/3rds what the
vendors would offer.  Most of them have "best cha/faction" and have
taken the time to find the best vendor, and have Gate so they can
magic themselves off to the bank to turn your heavy coins back into
PP and sell the junk off for another hefty profit.  Then they run back
to your zone and repeat.

Or you can do what I do and just destroy all GP, SP, CP as being
too heavy and not worth bothering with.

I drop by the bank enough that I can toss it all in there instead)
