Random acts of kindness.  DMF is the only buff a necro can cast on
someone they're not grouped with, so it's the only buff they can throw
at strangers.

I think waiting until they're out of sight and clicking it off, as you
mentioned, is the best way to deal with it.  Asking them to stop would
take more effort than clicking it off, and rob them of the illusion
that they've helped a stranger.
