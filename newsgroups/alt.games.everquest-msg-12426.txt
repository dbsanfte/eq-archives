Wow. What the hell would I get , with my...

"Excuse me... real sorry to bother you, but we're in kind of
a desperate situation and could really use an X. We'll come to
you an can pay in shiny platinum coins, hugs and friendship or
reciprocal aid if you need it. if not, I entirely understand... Hope
I didnt interrupt anything!"

... Full buffs and lifelong ports to the destination of my choice? ;) ;)

heh. The worst I've ever got is "Sorry, busy right now" and most
of the time people are pretty willing to help - sometimes at a price,
sometimes not, but hey. At these points its me in need of aid, so I
got to accept the bargain ;)

I very rarely fail to sow people; I give away low level loot like
gnoll lariats. But I always do it after peeking around a newbie
zone, to find someone who needs it... (Oooh, look, level 2, 
wearing 2 bits of clothh and using a rusty shortsword. Ding!)  and
 anyone who direct tells me "Can u give me stuff?" just
gets a simple "No." in reply.
