You love fascism dont you, I've seen the word used alot in your post.
However, my point of view is anything but fascist. I am asking for MORE
freedom to chose names...not less.

I said nothing about changing names...I only am talking about the original
name you chose when you start the character.

True, I didn't say they should follow what I said. but as a company they
should take personal opinion of the players into account when changing
things in the game. I see that some of you are very strongly against people
who break the rules, I am not talking about breaking rules, I am talking
about changing them.
