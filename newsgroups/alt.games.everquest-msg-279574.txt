I'm in Anguish.  "New" raiders don't join my guild.  They join a lower guild
and work their way up.  I haven't seen a "new" raider in literally years,
and wouldn't expect to.

You are misguided though.  There's no such thing as a lack of new raiders as
anything distinguishable from a lack of new players to the game.  There is a
noticeable lack of new players, but that has been the case for years as
well.  The newbie zones, before they went completely dark with the latest
patches, hadn't been overly populated since ~2002.

If your guild is on the very lowest rung of the pecking order, the lack of
new players to the game might translate to lack of new raiding blood, and
will I'm sure eventually impact the guilds all the way up the ladder. 
Already has, in fact, as many top guilds were not getting the "social
climbers" they always had in the past and collapsed.  I think for the most
part that has now slowed to a stop and in fact may be moving the other
direction again (hard to say with the server merges impacting any meaningful
"data" on the issue).

Again, though, the tangential derail, while bizarrely amusing, just doesn't
seem to fit in this discussion.  =)
