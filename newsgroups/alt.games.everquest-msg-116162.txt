Newbie is a term that has been around for a long time to refer to someone
who is new at something, I don't know if it predates computers or not but it
it's at least as old as BBS's. The difference between a newbie and an idiot
is that the newbie will want some help and the idiot will want a
handout/hand-holder. "Plz give me plat". "pl a n00b".

I'm more social in EQ than in RL. In RL I will socialize, but usually I
won't start up a conversation with someone unless I know them already. In EQ
I'm more likely to start a conversation with someone I don't know. This is
usually from being in a group with them. The fact that I go from zone to
zone and have irregular playing hours means that I rarely group with the
same person more than once or twice. Thus, in groups I'm always socializing
with people I don't know. And then my father comes in and tells me I should
"go out". Where would I go? What would I do? I don't know, I don't know
anyone, I have no friends. Now look what you've done: I'm depressed. I need
a drink.
