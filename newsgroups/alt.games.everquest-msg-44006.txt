OK, I apologize. I had thought that "What WILL increase your overall 
happiness playing, however, is blocking 
ports like port 80 at the roouter, as they will never make it to your 
machine that way and your machine will never have to think about them. They 
still clog your bandwidth, but they don't clog your machine." would have 
implied that this was exactly what I have done. My router firewalls this 
stuff and syslogs it to another box on my private LAN.

As for the webserver, one obviously cannot firewall off port 80 on a 
webserver.
