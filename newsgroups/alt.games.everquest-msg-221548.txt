It's long been acknowledged that due to game flaws, clerics can contribute
to groups well above thier level much easier than any other class.  Thats
not the question at hand.  The question at hand is whether druid complete
heals suck badly enough that they might as well not have them.   They don't.
Unless you have a tank 6 levels, 100 aa, (and gear to match) above you in
level, the limits on druid CH don't act as any kind of real detriment to the
spell.

Nobody is saying clerics are obsolete.  The original poster said "Druids
getting CH didn't make clerics obsolete."   Then the guy I responded to came
back with 'yeah, but druid CH sucks so badly it might as well not be CH'
(paraphased).   I was correcting that misinformation.   Druid CH is good
enough for a druid to replace a cleric in any non-raid environment.   And
even some raid ones.
