  Makes sense to me.  So theoretically, the GM doesn't even have to witness
the ceremony.  I'd think that all that'd really be necessary is to prenotify
the GM that you're going to get married on whatever date and then send them
a /tell saying you're ready for the surname change when the wedding is
complete and a minimum of time is wasted regardless of what happens during
the ceremony.  It's not as if the world's going to end if the bride's
surname doesn't change the moment the cleric says "I now pronounce you man
and wife." :)
