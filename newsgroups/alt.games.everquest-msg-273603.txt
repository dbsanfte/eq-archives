I would argue the inferior graphics part. The graphics are actually quite 
nice and rather beautiful, but the best part is, the server I'm on has no 
lag whatsoever...can run around all I want, looking at the beauty of the 
world, and don't have the huge lag spikes I was experiencing in EQ2 from 
those 'superior' graphics. :) I also like the fact that character creation 
is better than EQ2. In EQ2, I had expected this huge range of 
customizability, but instead, from what I've seen, you get a face that looks 
like everybody else's face, except you can make the nose, or the mouth, or 
the chin longer or broader...but you still look like everyone else of that 
race. With WoW, you can actually select between several facial features that 
look radically different from one another. Granted, I just started playing 
WoW last night, but have a 4th level night elf druid, a 3rd level human 
pally, and a 2nd level undead warlock so far, and am amazed at the 
playability of the game and the beauty of the world around my characters.
