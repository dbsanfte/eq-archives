My 19 gnome mage is fast outgrowing crushbone. I would like to find new
hunting grounds, but as a gnome he doesn't like to walk great distances,
he's only got tiny little legs afterall. As such, he sticks to firepot
locations.

I have selected either Runnyeye or The High Keep. Both are easily reached
from Rivervale, a firepot location.
The Keep has a long tradition of static group hunting. similar to CB, where
you basically sit on a table all night. I like this. The keep is also closer
to reach, but does require a trip through Kithicor, which is not a good idea
at night and I'm sure corpse runs will only happen at night.
Runneye however, while being in the same level range, offers a 20% exp
bonus, this is very nice too. And some proper loot. For mages, loot rules as
spells cost a fortune, never mind research equipment.

So, what would you guys recommend. I don't want to hear Paludal caverns.
Yes, it's a far better zone, yes, the exp is insane. I can't however reach
it without having to wait for the spires and on the whole my experiense with
luclin zones isn't all to good.
Would you say Runnyeye or the Keep? Or do you have a better location within
easy reach of a firepot?
