You need a good gaming computer for SoL.  If you don't have a GeForce2MX400
(64) or better; or an ATI Radeon 7500 or better; AND 512+ MB RAM; AND a
Pentium 3 (not AMD) or better, then I wouldn't upgrade at the moment.   Give
it a month or two...let us do the beta testing for ya. :)

(not saying ANYTHING bad about AMD...2 of my computers have 'em...just that
there are currently too many problems with AMD & EQ)
