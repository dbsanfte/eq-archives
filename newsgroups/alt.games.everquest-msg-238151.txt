None of the mobs in DL will hurt your VS faction, just the ones in KC.  Take
the book to Overthere and con the Cliff Golemns by the outpost, you can't
miss them.  If you are ok with them, you are ok with everyone in the
outpost.  Otherwise, it would seem your only chioce is to ask someone to get
them for you.  You could probably ask someone in DL who isn't kos to buy
them for you if you don't happen to know anyone.
