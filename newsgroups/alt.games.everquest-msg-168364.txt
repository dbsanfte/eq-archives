Its possible, though, that he got rez, clicked his body to loot (which insta
loots all your coin) and got kicked off it by that mob before looting a single
item.

Then, if he clicked to loot his naked body, he'd auto loot the coin again, and
have nothing to leave.  Now, if you stand there with your body looted a couple
minutes, you'll stand back up off it, and have a completely empty body to
leave... but in a dangerous zone, there's a risk a mob will kick you off and
this can make the corpse vanish.

Fear, Root, Snare, Blind, Stun, Mez... no, nothing taunts off low HP aggro, but
there are lots of things that some classes can do to save your bacon if its
happened to you.  Monks don't have those tools (instill doubt, perhaps?) either.
