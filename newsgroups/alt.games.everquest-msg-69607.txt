In AC it's possible to solo no matter what type of character you play.
In EQ it's not.  Only a very few classes can solo all the way to the
upper levels.  Very few (if any) of these are srictly melee types.  If
you want to play a melee character (which you seem to be implying),
then you will be grouping eventually.

Character creation is not the make-or-break deal that it is in AC.
You can misspend points, certainly, but you're unlikely to be totally
gimped as can happen in AC.

Unless you play a class that can port you rely on others to port you.

I think AC really shines at the low levels.  Lots of good,
challenging, interesting dungeons.  EQ gets more interesting the
higher you get.
