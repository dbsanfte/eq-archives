I already did exactly what you suggested.
Learned the hard way bout the Barb.
Am enjoying things more as a halfling ranger.
And I have printed LOTZ of maps (makes mental note to purchase more paper)
Thanks!

Oh one other question, how do guilds work?
Wondering how you sign up, is there a level that its better to be?
No one ever wants to group. Am attempting solo. (Zebuxoruk)
I would prefer a few buddies to help on the tougher stuff but haven't found
any.
Just watched a bunch of crusaders in Runnyeye yesterday. They were great
buffed me lotz when I hadn't even asked. THANKS FOLKS!
