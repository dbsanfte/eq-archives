I am teaming up with a friend and we are going with a Duo of necros, Levels
54 & 51.  Looking for some suggestions on where to go.  We have tried root /
rot in Maiden's Eye so far.  Worked well, but looking for something more
efficient.  Seems like somewhere we can fear kite would be a plus.  I would
go with the 49 pet for the tank and have him try the rogue pet with taunt
off.  Any advice appreciated.

Thanks in Advance
Xanisx
51st Level Necro
