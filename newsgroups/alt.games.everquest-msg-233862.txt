Ok let's back up a little.  The words "aggro" and "hate" are used
differently in different circumstances.  If a monster is standing
there minding his own business, he is not aggroed on anyone.  If he
decides to attack you, you have aggroed it.  That is the first use of
the word "aggro": for a monster to decide to attack.  A monster will
normally attack for one of three reasons.

-The first is that it just "hates" you.  If you get close enough, it
will attack.  The higher your level, the closer you have to get before
it will attack.  Also, sitting will increase the aggro range.

-The second is if you aggro its friend (either because it hates you or
because you attack it).  If one monster decides to attack you, others
nearby will also usually attack as well.  The closer they are to each
other, along with your level, will decide whether or not you will get
"social" aggro.  The higher your level, the closer one monster has to
be to another before it will help its friend.

-The third is if you attack a monster.  In almost every case, if you
attack, the monster will fight back, even if it likes you.

These are the three ways of aggroing a monster.  However under
different circumstances, "aggro" and "hate" mean slightly different
things.  When a group of people are already attacking one monster,
that monster will choose one person to attack.  Who it chooses is
based on how much hate it has for each person that has pissed it off. 
Ideally the one person with the best defensive skills and attributes
will be getting hit.  (Usually called the tank).  He will try to
generate as much "hate" as he can in order to hold "aggro"...in order
to be the one that the monster chooses to attack.  If he isn't very
good at generating hate, or if others are not doing their job very
well at *not* building too much hate, the monster will attack the
wrong person.  The right person will lose aggro and the wrong person
will gain aggro.

In a group situation where you are already fighting a monster, the
following will cause a monster to hate you more than he already does:
-Attacking it with your weapons.
-Attacking it with spells.
-Helping someone else that is attacking it, by healing or casting
beneficial spells on them.
-Being lower level than others gives you an automatic step up the hate
ladder.
-Sitting down increases your hate.  Standing up will instantly
decrease hate.
-Being closer to the monster.

Now just to be clear, this kind of hate and aggro has little or
nothing to do with faction.  Faction just determines whether or not
the monster will attack you in the first place.  As for what affects
your faction:
-Race
-Class (arguably)
-Religion
-Past Deeds (If you have killed guards in West Freeport before, they
may not like you too much in West Freeport, regardless of whether they
used to like you.)

You can decrease or increase faction with specific kinds of monsters
by killing or by completing quests.
