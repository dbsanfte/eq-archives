Heh this quest was much better for the Long Sword of Ethereal Energy. It's
stats were rediculous for the effort so it was nerfed about 2 months into
Luclin (IIRC).
THe other weapons don't sell too well, mostly around 500pp or so.

Sells pretty fast, but only for 500-800 or so.

As someone said, there is no "easy way" to making pp fast.

Best I have is 3 spots with nameds which I regularly farm and hope for rare
drops. Best I've done is 20k, worst is just over 2k for the evening. Good
enough for 2 hours of work imo. Only prob is that the nameds have to be up
and respawn is way too long on all three to actually farm them for steady
cash. For steady cash go for tradeskill stuff. Spidersilks, Rockhopper hides
or acrylia seem like petty cash, but farming them for an evening gives you a
few K easy.
