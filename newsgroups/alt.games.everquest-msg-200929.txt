Not what I said.  You read it the way you wanted to.  I said that they TEND
to be under-20, they TEND towards instant gratification, and they TEND to be
people who prefer first-person shooters.  That does not, in and of itself,
make them immature.  Those were your words, not mine.  I used a small subset
of the EQ players (those that I know and have had discussions with about KEI
and it's effects on EQ) to illustrate that which I have seen, not to make a
sweeping generalization.
