There are 2 merchants in South Karana where he could sell his
loot instead of going through all that.  One at the centaur
village, the other at the top of the aviak house.  The aviak,
Krak Windchaser, doesn't like certain races so those who can't
sneak can't sell to him, but the centaur, nnnn-Meadowgreen will
buy from anyone.
