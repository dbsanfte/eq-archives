Its live, its also bugged.

A room of mezzed mobs
DS cast on my rogue (by me:bot druid, who cast NOTHING else)
Each mobs mez was "broken" by the druid.  Bullshit I call!

Also had mobs hitting on me after mez break, and it said I had woken them
(ae mez, 4 wearing off at the same time) my "single target melee rogue"
broke EVERY single mez within a second though...

Its nice...  But its buggy.. and I can see some poor people get bitched at
by chanters for breaking mez, even when they didn't do shit !
