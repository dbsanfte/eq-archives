I have gotten several items that I cannot figure out what to do with.  One, is a
Rhino Beetle Horn (lore item), gotten from an Ash Beetle in the Shadeweaver's
Thicket.  The other is a Gold Tooth from a Recondite bandit in the Paludal
Caverns.  Have any of you heard anything about what quests, if any, these are
used in?

Thanks
