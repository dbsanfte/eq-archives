Kiting is you when use slow the movement of a mob with a spell like
snare and speed yourself up with sow and then run around leading the
mob all over the place while you hit  it with dots and nukes instead
of meleeing it in place or rooting then nuking.

Quading is the same but your doing it with more then just one mob,
usually 4 mobs.. hence the name Quad.

Hehe.. you will probably get a lot of different answers on this on.
What the primary purpose of a guild to me.. is just a permeant big
group that you are always in and can tap into for advice, help and
just generally chatting... basically if you in a guild you are really
never alone in EQ.
Hehe... except of course if its a small guild and there times your the
only one in guild online.. this has happened to me a few times.

Porting is done players and the only classes that can do are druids
and wizards. If you need a port to another location you /ooc for a
port  to west commons.. or some such other place. You usually offer a
donation for the service of porting you.
If your lucky a druid or wizard will answer your request and port you.
You will have to group with them in order to be ported.
A druid has to take you with him to new zone , but a wizard can trans
you. He can stay where he is and send you to new zone. Hehe. convient
for wizards.
Druids and wizards can ONLY port or trans you  to zones that that
Druid rings or Wizard portals (those flat topped pyramids things)
Hehe.. I like the druid rings.. looks like Stonehinge.

In Nortal Karana, if your referring to the portal  in front of the
stone bridge.. that is called a Nexus Spire, and it is portal to Nexus
which in on Luclin (and you need luclin upgrade to use it), that
porting is supplied by a npc and it ports approximately every 15mins

That machine is more then enough to handle Luclin upgrade, the most
important considerations for Luclin is Ram and video... since I don't
know what video card you have, I would suggest Geforce3 or better

The zones in Luclin range from level 1 all the way to 60, tho there
are considerably more zones that are 30+
Luclin has new race and new class including with it.. the Vah Shir and
beastlords,  and the vah shir has it own newbies zones.

Basically more zones, more quests, more mobs and more items to find.
But your a little low for anywhere on velious, Iceclad Ocean would be
the first place you'd be able to play in, its considered 30+ but I
have seen players in their mid 20's hunting there. but only around the
starting place at docks near gnome camp.

No... runes are research components that wizards use to create a new
spell that can't be gotten anywere else and has to be researched.
Hehe... research skill got kind of blown out the water with Luclin
now.  YOu can buy all the spells now, found them in Katta Castelum..
hehe, think I spelled that right.
