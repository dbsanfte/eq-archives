HP is a Shaman's lifeblood, literally, and STA affects HP. If EDU affects HP
in the same way that STA does, I don't have a problem, but anything that has
a net effect of reducing HP is not going to sit well with a number of
classes, Shamans among them.

Heh I didn't mean to suggest that *you* couldn't, but I couldn't resist the
temptation to generalize about all you big brutes. ;-)
