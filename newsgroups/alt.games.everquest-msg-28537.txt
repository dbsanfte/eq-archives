You can be rezzed if the rez's exp restoration brings you back
up to 46, or you can be rezzed even if you're still 45 after the
rez?

I've heard horror stories of people who were locked away from
their corpses due to dieing in the planes and losing 46, I
can't see how this would happen unless dying back to 45 prevents
rezzes as well as portal entry.
