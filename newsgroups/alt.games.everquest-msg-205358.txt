For your off hand, ratio is everything as far as damage output.  Well, 
rather (dmg*2+1)/dly is the comparison you should use in deciding what is 
best in the offhand from a strictly dps perspective.  If a weapon has a 
proc, or a very low delay, then it can have added benefit in the amount 
of agro it generates, which is a consideration for a warrior.
