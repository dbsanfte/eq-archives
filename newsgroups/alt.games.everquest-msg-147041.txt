hi


without my right mouse button held the mouse sensitivity is fine. as i
have upped it to 3 using /mousespeed 3.

but i often like to use the mouse (with right button held down, aka
mouselook) to look and spin around.

at the moment it is way too low a sensi even though i have my in-game
mouselook sensi set to 100%. 90 degrees in game is about 1/2 my
mousepad. i want to severely up it but i don't know how.

the /mousespeed command doesn't affect the mouselook sensi. i tested
with /mousespeed 100.

is there some other way other than drastically upping my windowsXP
sensi?

other than /mousespeed theres nothing in the manual.

in eqclient.ini i did a search on "mouse" and only found this:
"MousePointerSpeedMod=3". which is the /mousespeed setting.

TIA
