I think it's market saturation, combined with how easy it is now to get
a character to sixty. There's just nothing that special about it to
command the types of money that they once did. Plus, PoP has changed a
lot of the raid structure. There's only a couple classes that I would
picture selling well at all, and some you couldn't even give away.  And
the Loozor_01 in question here is trying to sell an account who's
marquee' character is a necro. Good luck with that. If he gets more than
fifty bucks he should go to church and give thanks.
