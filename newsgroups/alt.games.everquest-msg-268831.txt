Problem with being in those zones is that I don't have the equipment to
survive there (as far as I know, anyway).

Got the Guide a week ago from a drop, now I'm slowly (as time permits)
finding the locations or going back to them.  I suppose I should also say
that one more night's push should put me at Outfitter 18.  I'm already
making armour that I'm just barely able to wear.  Starting to produce stuff
for the guild, and a couple of spares to sell off.  If things go as they are
now, I'll soon be making armour which I'm too low-level to wear.

Guild says I'm spending too much time in the trade dungeons.  Day before
yesterday was the first time I've ever tried that spell that teleports you
back to your home town.  Me, I figure I'm not spending enough time there.
