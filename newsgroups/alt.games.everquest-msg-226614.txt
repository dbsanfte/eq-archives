It won't.

Yeah, by 5 points of hate or something.  Literally one swing in melee
range will overcome this hate.

First of all, while the warrior is the superior tank, it doesn't make
much of a difference at your level.  You mitigate almost as well and
since the Cleric may not even be able to CHeal yet, your hitpoints
don't affect the Cleric's efficiency that much.  Is CHeal efficient
even on a Warrior at that level?

Second of all, you probably had a shitty Warrior as tank.  He had a
slow main hand weapon (low agro) and was probably chain taunting like
so many warriors do until they figure out how to play their class.

I recommend you try not to limit your DPS just to lose aggro.  The
good news is that you don't have to.  Just get a wurmslayer.  The
higher delay means much less agro.  If a warrior gets pissy like that
in the future, remind him that agro control is his job as well.  If
you are doing everything correctly, then he isn't.
