Maybe this is something I should call tech support about, but...

I just bought EQ Trilogy, and SoL. I installed and patched. When I log
in, I can play for about 30 secs to a minute before I get
disconnected. I'm running on a 56k modem with nice phone lines - I get
connected at about 44 kbps and can usually download from sites at
about 5-8 kbps. I have an Athlon 1Ghz processor with a 512 stick of
RAM, and an NVidia GeForce 3 128. The game runs fine when I get on, it
just disconnects me. What can I do?

Also, should the loading screen say things like "And you thought it
was made of cheese", "You don't even want to know what it's doing
right now." and things like that?

Thank you much in advance.
