Auto split works by splitting the coin available, it cannot split 2 plat
between a party of 4 people.
The server isn't going to be able to calculate who received what in each of
the loots as to even that out (imagine the servers having to keep up with
that sort of info for ALL the groups currently hunting in groups with Auto
split on) and when the new members joining are due for their share, if they
tried to implement that they'd likely grind to a halt.

If the tanks are taking the lions share, then suggest a looting order and
loot 'til you've received a specified amount or have looted a gem/item etc.

It's always been the problem with the melee's looting the fact is that half
the time they are looting to clear corpses and casters needing all their
mana do not see the piles of giant corpses while medding.

Although, given the replies you got from your tanks I'd say the problem
isn't verants it's that you got stuck with a group of inconsiderate morons.
Tanks are one of the most desired classes in any group. Cleric IS the most
desired class to have in any group. If someone continually acts like a dick
then just don't group with him again, believe me, you'll have no problem
picking up another group.
