As a 21st Level Bard- I found out about the quickest and safest and
most boring way to make good money.

Get your Baking Skill up.
Go to Thurgin(?)- Valious City.

Make Stacks of Smoked Shark Meat.
Sell
Repeat

I make about 7-8PP every 10 minutes- but beware- there is a lot of
mindless mouse clicking...it is boring...and you don't advance your
character exp. wise since you aren't fighting anything...did I mention
it's boring?

Cya!
