Worked again today in KD, again with VOG, and also last night in PoN,
this time with a shaman buff (I failed to catch the message and didn't
get haste myself, just for my pet, which sadly died before the buff
wore off from an unfortunate incedent with a tree)

For the PoN experiment, I dueled a druid friend at the GY exit, cast
pet, had the shaman haste pet, and had the druid zone out.  Worked
just fine, and there was no need to engage anything that might have
been an actual threat with my pet not buffed and people paying
attention to pet setup instead of to the fight.

I had to heal the druid, however, apparantly a cleric pet on shaman
haste can chop a 60 druid up pretty bad before she can get to the zone
line.  Next time, perhaps a tank.
