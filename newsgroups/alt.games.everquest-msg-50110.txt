Also be aware that while the Dreadlands are vast, almost all
hunting there occurs only along the north wall of Karnor's Castle.
Teleport into the Dreadlands (or boat into Firiona Vie and then
zone over into Dreadlands), and then head for the north wall of
the big Karnor's building.  There are always multiple groups
there doing the exp grind, using the wall of the castle to
protect their backs, pulling from the fields north of the
castle.

It's probably the best place to find pickup groups throughout
the 40's, and the exp is easy, continuous, and safe (unless
your group majorly screws up).

Tip:  Refuse Wolf Form if a Druid in the group wants to
cast it on you.  There's often a wandering dragon in
the Dreadlands (Gorenaire) who is non-KoS to most players,
but she's very fond of eating wolves.
