But the problem is, any thefts that *are* accomplished
through sniffers/hacks/etc. won't be provable as such.
All the victim will know is that someone accessed their
account, but not know how.  Such hacks don't leave a
trail of evidence.

So despite your repeated insistence that there must not
be many hacked accounts because you haven't "heard" of any,
the point is that you WOULDN'T hear of them.  You'd just
hear of someone claiming theft, period.  There would
be no "smoking gun".  And you'd write it off as "likely"
account sharing rip-offs, despite not really knowing.
