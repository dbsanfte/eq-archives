Ok, so check this out. Im flipping through playerauctions and see a wizard
for sale at a good price. Im like let me try this so I go ahead and bid on
it. (yea yea an ebayed character) So I buy the wizard named Holmes. He's
freakin awsome.

http://www.playerauctions.com/listi...mnum=1019149459

I go through hell in 59 with him and spend over 100kp on gear including
buying sunstrike. I get him aa to almost get MB too. Six months go by still
lovin him.

Then I go to login and <You have entered the wrong password> WTF, I call
Varent, they say the original owner has taken him back and they cant help
without the keys or the original billers credit card info. <yea I know I
shouldn't have bought it without the keys, live and learn aye  ) So I
contact the original owner and he says "I dont know who you are but I dont
play eq anymore. This is all out of my hands." Now first off wouldnt you
want to help if that was true? So I call Verant and they say Daniel
Washburn, the original owner, is currently paying and accessing the account.
I email him again and my emails now bounce email unknown. Haha so he deleted
them. Washburn_Daniel_D@cat.com, darg@attbi.com, washbdd@cat.com,
Dwashburn@hotmail.com The hotmail one still works.

So I get his AIM NiggyNutz2 and aim him. I ask can you help and he says no.
Holmes is no more. So im like thats ok, can I have the account back though.
Thinking, now why would you so desperately not want to give back the account
and have someone bugging the hell out of you if you dont even play, and why
would you want to pay monthly too? Doesnt make sense.

So I call him and he says too bad. Then hangs up on me.
Daniel D Washburn
Information Services
Caterpillar Aurora
(630)859-5000

So this part does not make sense to me, I would understand taking back the
account and playing it. I would even be willing to share it. But:

FACT: He has been paying for the account the past month or 2.
FACT: He hasnt accessed the account since 11/4/02
ASSUMPTION: Holmes, the main character is no more (I dont believe)
QUESTION: Why would Daniel so desperately not want to return the account and
want to pay for it if he is not even playing it?

Give him a call see if you can figure it out.

***Reward for the person who gets him to return character.***

P.S. Before the flames start going mad below I answer your flames in
advance.

1. Buying an ebay character is wrong: well maybe so but thats not the issue.
To relate the issue in the real world it would be like buying a used car
from someone, spending 6 months into fixing it, time, sweat, and money, then
have the original owner pull out his spare key and come steal it back.

2. Level your own character: Well I did, I leveled my own wiz to 42 but I
had a number of friends who played who were at 60 and I figured this would
be a good way to play with my friends, the only reason for me to play EQ.
Remember this is just a game, its only about having fun. It doesnt matter
how you have fun or how you get to that point. If you've ever owned a
motorcycle you see that people riding Harleys wave to people riding crotch
rockets, people just starting out get cheered on by experienced riders, etc
Its just the joy that another person has picked up a bike and started
riding. It doesnt matter who they are or why they have. There just happy
there riding. Thats how it should be in EQ. You get another person to play,
dam koodus to you for picking up the game and playing. As for gear he came
fairly stripped so dont tell me I didnt earn stuff. I got everything new
that he had just about.

3. Changing password or splitting accounts: I did change the password but
all the original owner needs is the original credit card, name, and address
to take control back, the keys dont even mean anything if your the original.
As for splitting accounts, you can only split if the new account has the
same name as the original owner on both accounts.

4. Real Life Info: Hell yea, theres no rules here. Can you imagine being
ripped off for $450 plus 6 months of time and work, plus the cost to pay for
the account for 6 months.
