Actually, in my opinion (maybe ONLY in my opinion, heh) the game has
split into two broad styles of play, and is the better for it. Roughly
speaking, those who want "raid uberness" have what they want, and
those who like the "casual, friendly play" method have what they want.
The fact the two styles rarely interconnect in any meaningful way, in
the normal course of things, is no big deal. Yes, there is content
intended for huge raids but this does NOT mean the game is no longer
oriented towards casual, friendly play.  I'm a devoted non-raider, and
have never found problems in finding like-minded players. 

I agree with Annie - EQ is merely a computer game, not a way of life
for feck's sake!  Play whatever game you like that gives you fun, and
simply stop playing when it doesn't. Don't waste time in life by
starting a thread purely to complain about complaints directed at your
complaining post in a separate thread on a totally different forum  :)
