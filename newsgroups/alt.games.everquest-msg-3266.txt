HAHAHAHAHA  You're hilarious!  Just because a few 16 yr olds will come in
with lame d00dsp34k doesn't mean we're 0wn3d.

Click click, KFed.  Since you admit to being a lameassed child I'll go ahead
& start with KFing you, despite your entertainment value (at you, not with
you)...but you won't be the last one to be 0wn3d by me.  Bring it on, kids.
