First off, I am a chanter and my friend is a cleric. He just started
playing

Anyways, one thing we always fight about is that I am willing to fight
til death and he always bails. Whenever he is out of mana and there is
more than 1 mob, he will gate out of there. Personally, I would think
people would hate that and that he would have trouble finding groups,
but according to him, thats no problem. He always get tells asking him
to join their group. I dont get it..

If a cleric bails, when he is oom and there is two or more mobs. Why
is it still kinda easy for him to find levels at 24? Ive seen many
clerics that had to redo their guy and change their name cuz they were
runners. And word got around so they could NEVER find a group.

Thanks for ur opinions about the subject :)
