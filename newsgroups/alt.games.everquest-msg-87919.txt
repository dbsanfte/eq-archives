OK first off the only reason I use WinEQ is because My mouse cursor
actually moves at normal speed, if I log on with normal method my
cursor is so slow in game that when in groups people wonder why I
didn't engage in fight sooner.

Well, heres problem after last night patch, WinEQ seems to work ok
until you get to character selection screen. Then it seems I can't
acutally hit any buttons. If I use Enter key to get in game I can't
use any buttons at all.

Any body having same problem or know how to fix this

Thanks )
