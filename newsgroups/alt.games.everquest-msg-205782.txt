Neverwinter Nights, which is an open ruleset implementation of third edition
AD&D rules, sort of.

I find it quite difficult to set up playing areas to run, and twitchy to
actually GM with, but it -is- possible.  While most of the time, people make
scripted modules and people play them without a GM, a live GM can wildly expand
the options available to you in the game.  Its still not really as open ended as
a pen and paper game, since actually creating... well, say you decide you want
to sneak into the palace using the sewer system under the town.  Now in a
tabletop game, if I haven't prepared anything down there but want you to have to
work your way in, I can just make it up as we go along.  If its not built into
my module in NWN, though, I'm likely to either gloss over it, or have to break
for the night and come back tomorrow with the basics of the sewer system worked
out and programmed in.

EQ can do the same thing, but its always been rare that they actually do so, and
has been even rarer in the past year or so.  "GM events" were once seen every
couple weeks (so twenty or so players per world might actually get to
participate) but thats been tuned down to... hmm, I think I saw one in 2002.

Given the absolutely atrocious behavior 95% of the players exhibit, and the low
number of customers pleased per hour of labor involved in doing this sort of
thing, I guess they sensibly decided to concentrate their efforts elsewhere.
