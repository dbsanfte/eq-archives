Play how you want to or why bother playing... but if you don't want to get
der boot quick in a group listen to what they need. In my experience you
don't want a druid as main healer if you can help it but I always want a
druid around to snare a mob as it's about to run off, keep a damage shield
on the main tank, dot and blast the heck out of something that will be a
long fight, and throw a couple of buffs or a back up heal if mana permits.
