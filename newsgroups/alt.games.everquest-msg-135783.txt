Eww, Enrage are in meelee window too?
Though it were bad enough that i cant see the mobs last kills (had 2 
windows with hitsmode, 1 for my hits, 1 for mob hits).
And lets not forget the completely ridiculous Disc splitting. Do a 
/dics, and the list of dicss will come in chat window, and the time left 
in meelee window.
