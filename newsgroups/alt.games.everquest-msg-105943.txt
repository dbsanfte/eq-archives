It is frustrating, but it can still be done.  You can't pull non-stop
like you can with a cleric, but you can still keep a steady stream of
kills with reasonable downtime in between.

Oh, I have no doubt that playing a cleric well takes more skill than
playing a druid.  Playing a druid in a group situation, if you have
the main jobs taken care of (nuker, buffer, healer) is ridiculously
easy.  Playing healer you have to just focus on you MA and hope he's
good enough to do his job well.  Nuker, well, nuker is a pretty
straight forward job.  Wait till the mob is at 50% health and then go
Wrath of God on 'em.  I'd say that playing a cleric is probably the
second hardest job in EQ, right after playing an enchanter.
