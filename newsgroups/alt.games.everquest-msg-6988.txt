I could certainly be mistaken but I don't think either can be stunned from
in front.

A warrior's prime stat is STR.  If you're just choosing between the two,
ogre is probably the way to go.  Regen is awfully nice at low levels, but
soon enough you're going to pretty much HAVE to have a healer around when
you hunt, so 4hp/tick regen is just not going to make much difference.

It's a shame you can't be a troll to level 15 then change species to ogre.
