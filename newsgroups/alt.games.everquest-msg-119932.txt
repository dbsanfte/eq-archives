Most mobs which give decent exp can't be soloed by the pet alone. 
Healing the pet or helping out by nuking the mob draws agro and consumes 
mana.

You still only have one place per continent where you can port from. 
This means a lot of running and wasted time, so a wizard port is still 
very convenient. I wish mages at least had the wizard gate line of spells.

Also, mages have very little they can earn money from. Occasionally for 
summoning food, water, arrows and throwing daggers but you can't make 
much from that, nothing like a port, rez or decent buff.

That would mean wizards and clerics raking in too much money, because no 
matter where a player goes they would most probably need either a bind 
or a port or a rez ;)

IMHO wizards are already powerful enough. This recent addition makes 
mages more evenly balanced.
