Well... I honestly believe that no one actually thought witches existed even
back then. To believe in something that no one has actually seen is
ridiculous. I mean, sure, people believe in a magical man that lives in the
sky (that no one has actually seen or heard save St. John the Divine, and
other historical stoners), but are they really -that- ignorant?

Oh, wait... I withdraw my question.
