But there were a shit load of people that spent many hours trying to
solve this quest, when in fact, it didn't exist.  SoE lied from the
start about this.  A number of times it was posted on the EQ2 official
forums by mods and devs that "yes the quest is in the game, just no
one has found it yet".

Of course, no one is surprised.  SoE is the most deceitful company in
the history of gaming.  Hell just look at EQ2.  All the crap they
promised about it not being, it turned into.  It's no wonder WoW has
kicked the shit out of EQ2 in terms of accolades and, more
importantly, subscriber numbers....not to mention, pure fun.
