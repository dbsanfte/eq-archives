Not to sound like an ass, but I also feel it is common decency to respect
someones desire to inspect you whether they ask or not.  I have heard a few
valid reasons supporting the argument that it is someones right to inspect
(game feature, can turn the message off if you don't like it).  While they
may not be strong reasons, they are still valid and CLEARCUT reasons.  All I
keep hearing in response to why someone shouldn't do it is that it is rude
and disrespectful.  These reasons are someones OPINION and not clearcut.  A
supporter of this said that no one has the right to know what I have, but I
am a firm believer that if you carry something that looks "special," expect
to be inspected.  It is like growing a huge purple mohawk and complaining
when people look at you.  You are simply asking for attention and while you
may find it rude yourself, you have no right to condemn anyone.  Please do
not use the rape analogy as it does not fit in this case and that is fucking
sick.  There is a difference between looking at someone and raping someone.
I do not see an end in sight to this argument though I do think those that
are offended by uninvited inspections need to lose the kindergarten
mentality and move on.
