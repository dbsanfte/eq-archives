Just out of curiosity Lok, what do you mean by this?  EQ+Win2k+SBLive =
sound problems or just Win2k+SBLive= sound problems?
I'm just wondering because I, at one point, tried to "upgrade" from an old
Aureal Vortex2 sound card to SBLive and only got sound out of 1 speaker
instead of all 4.  Subwoofer didn't work either.
Went back to old Vortex2 and with new EQ, it sounds MUCH better than it ever
did in the past.

Safe travels,
Sean...
