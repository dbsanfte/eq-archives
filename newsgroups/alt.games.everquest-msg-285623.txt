Seconded.  Think of it from the OTHER side of the fence.  What if I'd
never played EQ and based my opinion purely on hearsay and what my
friends told me - and they all told me it was out-dated, boring and
bland.  When I, in turn, started mouthing off to all and sundry about
how utterly crap EQ was, and that *I* didn't need to have played it to
KNOW it, wouldn't that seem stupid?  Of course it would!
