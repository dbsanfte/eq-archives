Well, I see you shi8ners got your way. Jesus....... 


It really pisses me off that the elitests out there can't keep their
damned noses on their own faces and let players play how ever they
feel they want to play.

Who's to say YOUR method of play is the BEST anyway? Who the hell died
and left you in charge anyway?

I am getting sick and tired of people telling me in real life that I
am not living right and now it's filtering into the games I play. This
is out of hand.

Anyway, you whining little wimps got your way again. DAMNIT!!!
