I very seldom use snare to pull. for one its a butt load of aggro for
another it means that the mob takes his sweet ass time getting to camp which
can be anoying when you are trying to get some serious grinding done. Post
51 jolt or cinder jolt are my personal pulling preference. Prior to that an
arrow does a great job of getting a mobs attention.
Timing your snare is very important when it comes to agro control. As I
noted before snare is one hell of a hate generator so I try to give the tank
a little bit of time to build up agro before snaring, and a resist can
really put you up there in the hate dept so if you get a resist and don't
wait a tad before recasting you're poping right to the top of the list. This
is one of the reasons I like having Tangling weeds memed at all time as well
as snare. Its really handy for those times when either you couldn't get a
snare to land during the fight or for those occasions when you may space out
for a second and not remember if you managed to land a snare on that
particular mob. Just remember that the extremely short duration on TW means
it is not a replacement for snare. (ran into one ranger who had erased snare
from her spell book because she thought TW did the same thing)
TW is also great for when you want agro. Cleric heals tank and mob takes off
running to pound cleric into dirt. Drop a TW on the baddy and its like a
yoyo.

Could be a tad fast but a Lammy not nescesarily that big a hate producer.
Also seems the GJBS is a bit slower (never actually used one) so you may try
swapping it out to primary in order to slow your hits a tad. honestly a low
damage fast weapon like a lammy isn't gonna shine for you till your later
50s anyway when the damage bonus really starts to make a difference.
Another option is to pick up a two hander, Though understand that a 2hs can
sometimes generate more agro than a dual wield set up. You'll find very few
tanks who have problem holding agro with a hard hitting 2 hander like say a
windblade. Still at the levels you're talking about a decent 2 hander should
reduce your agro a tad with minimal effect on your over all damage output.

That's the big one. A Paly who doesn't stun is just a warrior with fewer
hitpoints and lower damage output.
And that lack of damage output reduces their agro which is why they have to
cast to keep the mobs attention.
