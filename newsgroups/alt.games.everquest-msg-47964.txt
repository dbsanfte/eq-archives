Yes and I have said I was WRONG, but my description of how DW works is
correct. My reasons for choosing the CSS was flawed so try reading the part
where I admit my error then apply it to the whole post I made.

What I was defending was my description of how DW worked that Sang stated
was wrong, it wasn't, my final answer WAS and I have admitted that but that
seems to be taking some time to sink in.
