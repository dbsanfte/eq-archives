Good thing I don't care if you believe me.  :)  

Seriously, though, I didn't forget the specialisation.  It just seems
to me that it can't account for THAT level of mana preservation.

As for Happ, yes, did her starting at 44, and yes, the spell in
question cost 6-7% of my mana bar per my UI, which measures such
things.  So yes, I may have had 3900 at that level, though that is a
bit much.  Either that, or my UI is faulty.

As for +100 on most items...well, my other half is in an "uber" guild,
and at about 43 I started getting hand-me-downs of his droppables. 
There weren't many "recommended" or "required" level pieces then, so I
got the full benefit early.  Twinked?  Well, admittedly, by that time
I was fairly well twinked out.  But even when I was younger, I had
quite a mana pool on me, and that continues, although there are
clerics in my guild who put me to shame (6500 mana...grumble).  I do
have the Earring of the Solstice and got it when I was about 51; that
means FTI, so my large mana pool regenerates VERY slowly.


As for being rich, I have never been that, nor will I ever be.  Until
recently, I paid for all my own 'dots.  Now, I pay for about half of
them.  Clerics who do that don't get rich unless they can stand to
tradeskill (I'm not one of those), they hoard all gem drops in groups
(no way), or they buff and rez ad nauseum for plat (I don't charge
unless it's offered and not always then).

But as for the rest of your post, well, believe what you will.  It's
possible, whether you like it or not.
