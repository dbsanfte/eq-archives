    Call it what you like. We have the same problem here in Australia. A
relatively easy lifestyle has produced a generation of spoilt brat kids who
have grown up to be assholes adolescents. What do the mothers and fathers
do? They proberly don't know because they are both working 80hr weeks to pay
off the mortgage. Ever heard of "Little Emperor Syndrome" in mainland China?
It is not limited to one particular country/region, if anything it tends to
follow and economic trend.

    Spoilt brat kids = asshole adolescents.

    You get assholes in all countries, but generally speaking the better the
lifestyle the greater the concentration. Some cultures have had politeness
drilled into them from infancy. That tends to skew the bell curve. Some
cultures have grown up on "pulp fiction/nat' born killers" type
entertainment that idolizes assholism. That also affects the bell curve.

    A gameworld full of Australians would be full of assholes too, that I
have no doubt of. Australian youth mimic American culture as far as our
"peso" will allow. In recent years in Brisbane I have noticed more and more
youths begging on street corners....and of course telling people to f_ck off
when they don't give money. *MMRPG flashback* Do they need the money?
No(#) - they just think it's cool to be an asshole.

    But a game designed from the ground up as a global game? It would still
be full of more assholes than normal because the biggest single limiting
factor for online entertainment is disposable income so you wouldn't get a
broad spread, but the average would proberly still be better than
<predominantly Aussie> or <predominantly yank>.

    Maybe my time spent of Japanese servers was a misunderstanding. Maybe
they were all saying "f_ck off or give me money or I am going to azzrape
your corpse" and the language translator changed it to "hello blue horse
salad sandwich". Who knows - but it seemed a much more pleasant place,
whether from my ignorance or their culture.

Bought it off the shelf in a department store. It was roughly 3 months after
US release. The only thing I had trouble with was Kunark, once SoV came out
the stupid software stores thought it was a sequel and stopped stocking
Kunark for a few months.

I am bitching at people who say jerkism is "our fault".

The invitations been out for a long time and it's getting a whole lot
broader. Get used to it. And yes, your beer over there "doth sucketh verily"
and I mean literally. Maybe you only export the cruddy stuff - but *pah*
every American beer I have tasted tastes worse than Fosters (one of our
worse beers).   =P


# in Australia unemployment benefits do not run out. They beg for
recreational money (drugs, alcohol, cigs).
