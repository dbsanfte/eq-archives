I kind of believe fast leveling is pointless, unless you've already been
there done that, to the point that it's become tedious.

By speed levelling  you simply bypass a huge amount of in game areas. There
are no doubt an 'elite' group of players who are simply blind to any area
other than the end game. which most of us do not get to see, simply because
it requires a certain kind of dedication to acheive.

Personally I don't have the time or inclination to sit around waiting for
others, when I'm playing I want to be making some kind of progress, not
sitting on my ass, waiting for a raid to get together.

I suspect that, certain huge and well practiced guilds don't do this, enough
practice and they probably have things down pat enough that people show up
and get on with it, but I doubt I'll ever see them, due to not having the
patience to do the interim bit, with less proficient guilds.
