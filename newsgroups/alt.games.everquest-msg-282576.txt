Back when ports were actually helpful to get to places, I would OOC in 
PoK offering 200pp or so, and if I didn't get a bite within 30 seconds or 
so, I was already hoofing it.

I agree absolutely, that just because you are a druid or wizard, does not 
mean you are a taxi.  I have no problems with people using ooc or auction 
to look for a ride, or any other service other players can offer.  I hate 
getting tells for the services, and generally ignore them.
