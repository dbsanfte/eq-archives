I've said it before, I'll repeat it here, soloing in EQ2 appears to be no 
more painful than in EQ1.  I've soloed at almost all levels of EQ1 from 1 
to 69, so far, I've soloed about 70% of the time to level 21 in EQ2.  In 
fact, I have reached level 21 in EQ2 far faster than I did originally in 
EQ1.
