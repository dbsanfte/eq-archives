The early levels, up to level 10 or so, the Shaman would have no issues with
being naked, heck, he was practically naked during those levels when I
created him.  It's just not that hard to find a decaying skeleton with a
club.  My shaman did not have any gear to speak of until he was in his 20s
anyway, and I somehow managed to get there anyway.  I actually did not start
doing the root and rot, regen and can thing until the late 30s, early 40s
anyway.  Up til then, I soloed by just kiting a mob.  Run, stop, nuke, run
some more.  I was still wearing banded armor well into 30s, along with one
or two pieces of totemic, and the odd minor wisdom piece.  I'm not saying a
shaman is the best, just that a shaman is perfectly capable of starting from
the point of being naked at any level, and killing mobs, and re-equipping
himself.
