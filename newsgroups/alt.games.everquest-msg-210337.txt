Well, I was thoroughly enjoying Everquest until I leveled to 11 earlier
today. I have a High Elf Cleric, and since making level 11, every single
time I attack a bat or wasp, a basilisk suddenly appears and it becomes
another corpse run. I have dropped back to level 10 eleven times if you
can believe it. Each time I went to the next zone Butcherblock Mountains
and regained my level. I am determined to finish my Cleric armor quest,
so I must return to the zone each time. I know I could wait until I am a
higher level, but a friend who started playing yesterday, was finished
her Barbarian Warrior armor in 25 minutes. As soon as she logged,
someone gave her 25 plat and she bought everything she needed for her
armor. I have a lot of nodrop pieces to collect, so this is not an
option for me.

The pieces I still need seem to be exceeding rare. Mature Arborean Bark,
Arborean Sapling Bark and an Arborean Amber for a weapon. I have seen
one of the mature versions of the bark, but after 2 levels of hunting
saplings, bark has yet to drop.

Do any of you know of other quests I might do as a change of pace? All
of your earlier advice was right on the mark! I have made sure that
Sense Heading, 1 Hand Blunt, 2 Hand Blunt, Offense and Defense are
maximized. I should really cast my spells over and over to maximize
those skills, but I have been too busy leveling and questing.

Thanks again!!!

Mark
