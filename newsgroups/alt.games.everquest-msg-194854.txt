The number of mobs you -need- magic weapons to hit is quite
small, even if you end up using a non magic weapon you'll rarely
have call for this song.

If you do use it, remember that its at the cost of a third or
quarter of your song output; so its entirely possible that
swapping in a crappier but magic weapon would be a better way to
go.

That said, no, I don't think there are all that many really good
and undervalued non magic weapons, I recall my cleric having a
two hander with a pretty good ratio that he'd picked up cheaply,
perhaps because it was non magic, but that was pre bazaar, and
prices on just about everything are now much lower than they were
back then.  Velium weapons, if nothing else, can be had for less
than the price of a single level 9 spell.

PS as an aside, back in the "old days" when every Tom Dick and
Hairy couldn't easily afford a magic weapon, the tools used to
hunt the wily Wisps were... summoned by mages!  Yep, from level
one on all you needed was a friendly mage to hand you a dagger
(or staff if he was a bit higher level) and you were good to go.

Of course the "mudflation" phenomenum has driven the utility of
those items into the dirt long since, but they are still in the
game
