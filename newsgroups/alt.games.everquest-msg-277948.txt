That's a poor comparison. PvP has *never* been officially recognized as
a detriment to the game. Besides, PvP is a funtion of the game, not an
external market to give people a leg up in the game world.

Face it. If they could or cared to do much about it at a reasonable
cost, they would have long ago. That's not gonna change.

Again with the inappropriate comparisons. This has nothing to do with
game dynamics. It's all about outside influences being allowed to affect
the game in an adverse manner.

No one's lost anything here. The sky is certainly *not* falling.
However, SoE has undeniably set the stage for increased game item sales
activity. 

* They've never been able to do much about it in the past.
* They've now made it crystal clear that they no longer disagree with
real world sales of in-game items/coin on neither a philosophical nor
ethical basis. 

One doesn't have to be a rocket surgeon to do the math on this one.
