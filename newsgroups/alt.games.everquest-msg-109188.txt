}The kunark or luclin prima guide is nice, especially Luclin, but as
}other people said its either info on the web or info you don't need.
}It does stupid waste of pages things like listing all the leather,

}either don't buy such things cause they suck or you go and look at the
}vendor and see the stats then.

Funny, I use the kunark Prima guide, and that's one of the two features I 
actually find helpful, the other being the skill lists for the various 
classes.  The spells lists are way out of date so I don't really rely on 
those anymore, although sometimes it's helpful to give me an idea of how 
many non-velious or luclin spells I should be finding when I get a new 
twink up to the first spell circle or so.

But you'd be amazed how many times I'm in a group and somebody asks in /g 
or /gu if anyone just happens to know the AC for such and such a scrap of 
crappy newbie armor (bronze is probably most frequent) and hey, I've got 
it right there. :) It's not always convenient to run off to a merchant to 
get the answer.  In fact, it's almost -never- convenient to run to a 
merchant that's probably not even in the same zone as you to answer an 
inane trivia question like that.

Sure, I could make my own lists for all the stuff in the guide from 
Allakhazam or Caster's Realm, but you know what?  That would take time.  
The amount of time I didn't spend printing all that junk out was easily 
worth more to me than the cost of the book.  I already have enough stuff 
printed out that wasn't in the Prima guide, like my dead tree editions of 
eqtraders and eqatlas. :)
