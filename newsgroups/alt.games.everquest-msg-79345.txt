Eh, I'll mention the negative side...if your baking is just to the point
where fish rolls are trivial, you're going to have a 25% failure rate if you
have as much bad luck as me.  But still, it's only 2 ingredients, probably
much cheaper to make than most anything else and it DOES last quite a while.
