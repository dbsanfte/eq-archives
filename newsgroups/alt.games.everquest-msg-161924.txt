btw I mean no insult by this. It is easily taken as such, and let me
apologize in advance if you feel the need to take it as such.
Hello kids, the word for today is 'Griefer'. Can you say Griefer? I knew you
could.

I presume you play on Sullon Zek? The other Zeks have (or at least had) some
restrictions on what level you could pk others at (within 6 levels or
something). I abandoned my Zek characters long ago, so this may have
changed.
Based on my experience at least 10% of the overall player base on the EQ
servers enjoy life most when they are making someone enjoy life the least.
On the zeks, I would put that number as high as 20-30%. Sullon Zek, which
allows the use of such classic Griefer tactics as corpse camping, killing
anyone no matter how green, and  bind camping, has a reputation that
indicates that this faction is perhaps 50% of the player base.
Those who feel the need to justify their griefing on SZ will say, by ganking
babies they hinder their ability to gain xp, thus limiting the number of
threats they will eventually face. Also they are clearing the area for their
own babies to gain xp in a safe and protected environment. Therefore by
taking their level 60 to pk your 10th level char, they are helping to
promote the dominance of their faction. Which is, I guess, true after a
fashion.
Of course then they whined and moaned about that Bard that beat them at
their own game, all in the name of promoting his side, but that's a
different story.
