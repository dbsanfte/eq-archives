    Odd I never heard of it then.  I'm quite the newsgroup/forums junkie. 
If something was causing an uproar, especially in the last 4 years, I think
that I might of heard of it.  That said, I'm not sure that I ever played on
whatever server this supposedly happened on.

    For what it's worth, I did hear _alot_ about the guy who killed himself
and his mom that tried to sue Sony for it.
