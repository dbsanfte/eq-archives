Well I put in a bid on playerauc...LOL, no way!
The account belonged to a RL friend, he cancelled it (awaiting next billing
date) and gave me the login details. I'll prolly take take up the payments
(It also helps keep our guild going, must be near the deletion level now)
The fact is, if I hadn't gotten use of the new account and a priest class
I'd prolly have quit myself (as have all but one of my friends, that played
and most of my Guild...at least the ones that didn't leave to Join CoR) now
I have renewed interest.
Being a casual player this instant partner means I no longer need to worry
about finding a group, I can drop everything in a shot to join a guild group
(if there are ever 6 players on at once) or port players in need, when I
want, without have to worry about upsetting anyone. It's a liberating sense
of freedom, from being used to waiting for a group or doing constant pulls
for 3hrs constant I can do everything at my own pace.
