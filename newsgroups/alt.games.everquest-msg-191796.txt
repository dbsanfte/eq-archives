No...re-nerf them, make them suffer more, mess up FD like you did before ;�)
I am still toying with the idea of making a Monk again, My first character
was a Monk but I made such a bad job of him he got deleted at 20th...Made
others since but they never get passed 11th :�/

Right, so does this mean I(anyone) can no longer use Wolf form to gain a
faction bonus?  Does it also mean that Boon of Garou and Wolf Form
(sheesh...KC was not a good place to test that...Trying not to train all the
people hunting Katta Guards with my "entourage"  took some doing, luckily I
knew my way around) will no longer make you KoS on Luclin?
