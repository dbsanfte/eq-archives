Name any other MMPRPG that has lasted longer and has grown to 400K+
subscribers over a 3 year period.

Define what you mean by "whole lot". For a lot of players the high-end
game of EQ is much less "fun" than the lower/mid-levels . It requires
a much larger time commitment (raids, epic camps, faction farming,
ect), and it is impossible to role-play when you have to coordinate
2-3 groups in raid level zones or planes.

You are making a false assumption. EQ1 will not end when EQ2 ships.
When EQ2 lauches we will be able to choose between both games. Your
very argument is based on the fear of the changes that EQ2 will cause
to the EQ1 community and to the existence of EQ1 itself.

You claimed that Verant does not understand their customers, and I
refuted that claim with in-game and out-game examples that show Verant
is very much interested in their customers and the community. Show me
your evidence that Verant doesn't understand what their customers want
or need? (direct evidence, not the typical they nerfed my favorite toy
whine)

You have yet to turn my own words against me. So what is your point?

Nothing I have written is even close to a flame. You must not read
usenet much.

I have responded to each point you have presented with direct quotes
from your post. Perhaps you could be a bit clearer on your point.

ar�gu�ment

>you got nothing

You are quick to use cliche barbs. Too bad you cannot back them up
with intelligent comments.
