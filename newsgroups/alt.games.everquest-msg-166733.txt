First off, top posting is discourteous.

Second, the description you quoted, referring to "prices" and
"investment" is obviously presuming a medium of exchange (i.e.
money), you're being deliberately obtuse by denying that.

Third, capitalism predates that sort of dry description of it by
quite a few centuries, and has been practiced in very unfree market
conditions far more often and for far longer than in markets that
are relatively free.  This suggests that your description (I won't
call it a definition, because it is too poor) comes from a person
or persons with a political and/or social agenda that they expect
to further by redefining words.
