LOL...me either...sacrasm eh?

On the boat thing...I seem to be having lots of problems with them lately,
anyone else see these?

1. Get on boat in FP.  Zone into OOT, LOADING...PLEASE WAIT,  Then BAM ! I'm
standing on the dock at SIS Island...
2. Standing on boat.  Boat turns after zoning...Now standing in middle of
ocean...
3. Sitting in bottom of boat to wait out ride.  When reach destination, I
stand and begin to walk, but no longer in hull, I'm on top of boat.
4.  Get on boat, fall through deck.  Swim back to shore...

Strange problems like this about the past two weeks.
