Y'know, I don't think I've ever seen you post any of your artwork.  All
this time I thought you were at the Studio because you thought the people
there were so nice. ^_^

I struggle with the jealousy a lot too.  And not just when people are
better than me (that's usually easier to swallow), but when someone I
think is worse than me is getting more praise than I do...talk about some
mega sulks where no one can see me. ^_^

Fortunately pixel art is something I'll never get into seriously, so I can
praise and adore Neilani's work till the cows come home and there's no
tinge of jealousy.  Similarly with Saraquael's work.

But yeah, what is your artistic "thing", DT?
