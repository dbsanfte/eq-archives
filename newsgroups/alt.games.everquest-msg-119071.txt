Because removing the ability to debuff mobs entirely would totally
destroy some major hunting strategies and basicly get Verant slammed
harder than they've ever known before, probably causing the majority
of their player base to leave in disgust of such an idiotic move...
And, honestly, the way the game engine works, that's the only way to
remove the ability for cancel magic to dispel player-cast spells on
mobs.

And, really, cancel magic working on player cast spells does create a
legitimate challenge. They can no more remove the potential abuse of
this ability without destroying gameplay than they could remove the
ability to intentionally train people without doing the same...
