Ah, if you kill something with -only- DS damage, it poofs (leaves no body) and
no one gets exp or faction hits.  But if someone does at least one point of
damage, the person doing the most non DS damage gets the credit and the body
stays, even if the DS gets the "killing blow."  What's apparently different
about rains is that no matter how much of the damage was done by other means, if
the rain gets the killing blow you get a poof and no exp, just as if a guard NPC
came up and got the killing blow on that mob you were working on.
