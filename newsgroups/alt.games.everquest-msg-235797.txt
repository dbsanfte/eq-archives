Alright, is there a quick and dirty run-down of how I would go about
transferring all of the data off my computer to a new, blank
hard-drive without having to fully install WindowsXP first? Is there a
utility on the XP CD, by chance? I've got a new system on its way, and
I want to see if there's an easy way to get around having to
re-install from scratch when it gets in... 

After that, I'll have to work out how to put my secondary HD into it
(I've installed a secondary HD before, just haven't done it often or
in a long time, so memory's potentially off). Just want to copy the OS
installation and other vitals from the old C: drive...
