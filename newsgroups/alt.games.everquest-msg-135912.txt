Having tested a customer's system (oooo baby!) with the following
configuration:

Intel P4 2.5GHz
2GB DDR333 RAM
other stuff
GeForce 4 4600 128MB
more other stuff

tested on my LAN with cable modem connection

I can say that even the Bazaar with bards singing, casters casting, ,
hundreds of toons and pets going, there is * almost * no perceptible lag.
That said, how many people have that to work with?

I hope he doesn't want his computer back too soon :P
