And no more guessing how long your own corpse might be viable.

Another fun use for this is now being able to tell *exactly* how
long it'll be before a corpse goes to "general loot" status
(i.e., when anyone, not just the group who killed it, can
loot it).  Wait for 6 minutes (or less) on the mob decay timer,
and then loot.

Well, give or take -- I just did a test, and although mob
corpses last 8 minutes, and general loot takes effect after
two, the timer actually read 5:56 before it would actually
let me loot.  Go figure.
