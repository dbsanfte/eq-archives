Setting up a wireless network will be many times more expensive than
setting up a wired network. What is your justification for having a
wireless network setup? If you are using two desktop systems, and one
laptop, there is really no reason why you would need a wireless network,
since two of the three machines will most likely never be moving
anywhere.

Additionally, wireless is EXTREMELY slow, compared to ethernet. Where
Ethernet can give you speeds of 10-100Mbps, you'd be looking at about
1.6mpbs (MAX) for a wireless connection. As far as range is concerned,
don't expect any decent connectivity, really, beyond 30-50 feet. I've
worked for a couple companies that had wireless networks, and they had
transmitters installed above the ceiling panels about every 50 feet or
so. There were some "dead" areas, but for the most part, that seemed to
be the best distance. Wireless is really not the way to go, if you can
help it. You get horrible speed, and you're really going to have more
headaches than you would avoid.
