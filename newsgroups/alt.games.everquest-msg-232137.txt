Ok, gotcha. Sorry if I misunderstood, but I really wasn't trying to be
silly. From the context of this discussion, it seemed to me that you were
saying that there was some sort of abstract imperative from a market
standpoint that you "must" offer some kind of "fair" consideration or else
the deal wouldn't be considered "legitimate" in some sense. What you're
really saying in this phrase is just that if I want to buy something from
you, I "must" persuade you that what I'm offering is of sufficient value to
you. I have no problem with that, I totally agree. Just my mis-reading, nm.
