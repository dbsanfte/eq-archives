Hmm, I can imagine the glee at me using my lower-than-melee archery
DPS *and* adding a DOT to every mob I shot with it ;)

I might - *might* - consider getting the ice arrows now they stun
(0 second, so just a spell interrupt really) level 65 mobs, but
originally they didnt stun anything over 55. Even still you need
the extortionately expensive level 3 version of the AA and it takes
a buff slot.

Still. Im very close to the point there are no useful AA left to
buy. I have 8 more AA to save and I have sinister strikes done and
at that point I have maxed every resist bar cold resist (which I
can stack Seasons and Circle on) and bought every significant DPS
AA (not counting maxing double riposte or +kick damage), and most
others besides.

Just as an aside, over a sustained night at the POE zonein helping guildis
get the pet whip to play with I parsed my sustained DPS while tanking as
180 (Timespinner mainhand, whip of the earthcrafter offhand). Amazingly,
the two 150pt augs on my weapons counted for 15dps *Each*, according to
EQ Companion. Thats a pretty serious boost for a paltry number of LDON
points. [*]

Hm. Also curious... the offhand aug counted for as much damage as the
mainhand, despite being on a weapon with about the same delay.....
