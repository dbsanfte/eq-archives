I forgot to give equivalent directions for those using the map from
www.eq-toolbox.com. If you follow the red lines, you will end up eventually
on a teleport at the north edge of the map. Go south to the wall and back
north to the teleport. Follow the red lines again. It will be tricky to show
this maneuver on an updated map because it's a short double line.

Maybe teleport I triggered automatically before and we never noticed the
double port. If this is a consequence of the new geometry, we could be back
to the old way when they fix the bugs.
