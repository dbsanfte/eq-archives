I use dude alot, usually after i helped someone, "you ok dude?"

and the otherss down below with my guild mates and friends.

Bro gets me, just cuz of the iksar gender thing.

when someone says thank Brother for all your help, and then the term bro is
constantly used, I just correnct them with a smile and a wink.  usually they
can't tell.

I think most of the time when someone uses terms like, bro, dude and bud is
when they are talking to someone they can't see, ie tells and so forth, not
saying it is wrong because i sure would hate to ask a favor of a individual
and call them sir and find out it is a ma'am.  Makes me look like i don't
care who they are only if they can help.  Personal wish....that everyone
would play an iksar so they know male from female )  *grin*

Duuuudddde?
