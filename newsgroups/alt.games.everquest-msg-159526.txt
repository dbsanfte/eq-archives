Yes, say it once with the above mentioned method. Exit the game, look up the
journal file (eqlog_charname_##.txt) and find the line where you say it. On
this line is the name and the itemnumber cut this and paste it into the
socials section in you charname_##.ini file.
including the control code character.

Incidentally this is how spoofed items get flunted in /auction, someone
tried out a bunch of item numbers and found some with insane stats (obvious
items not to ever drop but they are in the database at VI, they are only
numbers on the client side so they can put whatever in the database for
tests or whatnot).
