The average price is 100pp.
I've seen it go from 50 to about 200pp. They are very rare occasions that
the chanter will give a C3 (or KEI) for a port.

I once had a great deal. This chanter (/hugs) ask for a SoW and one
fishscale to give me a C3. My jaw dropped on the floor I can tell you. I had
3 C3's so far, 2 were free and one was because I ported someone to Freerott.
The last one I got was a payed one because I was so close to 40. Payed 100pp
that time.
