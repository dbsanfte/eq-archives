Because despite the rules, people -will- swear, and putting the filter in 
may reassure parents who would otherwise not let their kids send them

I dunno, seems like people who swear keep getting fucked by them in a 
vaguely arieal fashion.  If they didn't give a flying fuck, why are they 
so ready to distribute them?
