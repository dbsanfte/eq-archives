Some suggestions are Lavastorm, Lavastorm and, oh, Lavastorm. Seriously - 
its full of fire imps and fire elementals. Pretty resistant to fire nukes, 
but *summoned*, so you can use ward summoned etc on them (very efficient 
nukes compared to your regular ones). Other things in zone, like the rock 
dervishes (or whatever they're called) and the drakes can be porcupine-
meleed - just stay away from the lava basilisks, they have a nasty stun 
proc.

To get there, get a high level druid to port you or camo your way through 
Nektulos (the dark elf guards will eat you otherwise).
