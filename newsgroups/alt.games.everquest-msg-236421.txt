it seems like you skillup faster on the blue ones. maybe because they are
easier to hit I dunno. I always seem to see more skillups when im fighting
blues than white yellow or red though. kinda the same way with tradeskills..
the new ui color codes stuff, and it seems to skillup more often on blue
combines than higher difficulties.
