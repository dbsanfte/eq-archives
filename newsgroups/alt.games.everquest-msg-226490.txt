   I dunno about the motivation.  On FV, Teapray usually wakes up from trader
mode with a mod rod in her hand.  Yet FV rarely reached the trader limit.  She
had one in her hand when I camp home from work today. The last couple of days it
has been around 350-425, not getting any where close the 550 limit.

   So maybe some are just being jerks to be jerks?
