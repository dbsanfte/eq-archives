Fortunately, being a shaman, I share the same drops with Rangers, and we
have lots of Rangers in our guild.  Got my first piece, sleeves,  last
night, not great, but still an upgrade.  In my guild, all classes that are
eligible are in on the rolls, so long as it is an upgrade.  We got one
chain, one silk, and one plate drop hitting the area near Gleed.  The arena
was camped, which was our original plan.
