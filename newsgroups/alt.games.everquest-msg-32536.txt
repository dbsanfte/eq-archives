A lot of folks here at work have discovered Webshots (www.webshots.com).
Actually, I highly recommend the software.  Great wallpaper shots, cool
features.

But Gator comes with it.  You do have the option of NOT installing it, but
it's not very obvious (most software installs require a simple "yeah,
whatever" when asked a question).  Although I haven't seen any downside to
Gator I've heard enough grumbling from here and elsewhere that any time I'm
at someone's PC to fix something I go into Add/Remove Software & see if it's
loaded.  If so I delete it with no muss, no fuss.
