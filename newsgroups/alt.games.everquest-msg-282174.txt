Bah,stop making useless whiney posts,I am sure there is a ton
of  SOE staff trying their best to deliver a stabile software as
possibly,dont forget the game was just released,so give them
some time to work the bugs out.
And isnt it great that at the same time there are working folks on
fixing bugs there is another team already very busy to present us
with the next glorious,magnificent expansion which will have
features you would not even had dreamed of?
I absolutly have no doubts the future of EQ will be golden with all
the competent designers, programmers and brilliant marketing guys.
