Fortunately *You wouldn't*. That's the whole friggin point.

On good old earth I can't meet my friends in China for a soccer game, 
and then spend a couple hours skiing in the Swiss Alps, before ending my 
day touring Aztec pyramids in Mexico. 

But you don't whine and bitch that the Earth is too big and that it 
takes to long to get anywhere. You just spend time in and around -where 
you are- and every now and then you drastically change where that is.
