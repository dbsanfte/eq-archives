Ah... Joys of the braindead...  I think I see that at almost any level.
Like my Rogue (Yes... I have 8 characters...)  I tell them to stay on ONE
side of the mob.  Every time I pull, they surround it, so I can't Backstab
the mob when it keeps flipping around.

Grouped with a Bard who insisted on playing the AE Discord song, despite
the fact my Enchanter warning about mezzing a mob, or watching the group
try and nuke and attack a mob that is just pacing in front of them, when I
mentioned already he was charmed.

It's Quake all over again.
