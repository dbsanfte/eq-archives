Yeah, training is not the problem.  I am having same prob and I posted on
the subject above.  Is some kind of glitch but noone seems to have an
answer.  Also, it has happened with skills that used to show up and now
don't. So it can't possibly be a training issue.  Dragging it onto the hot
button bar at left will have to do for now I guess.
