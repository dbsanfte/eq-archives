What would I do on my warrior?   Three points of run speed, then either
stamina or the extra bind wounds ability for three points.  After that, damage
mitigation and damage avoidance.   The 10% hit points one after that probably.
Perhaps ambidexterity after that, or I might treat myself and get combat fury
then flurry.

What would I suggest that you do on your bard?   I'm not sure.  Runspeed would
be nice for when you're indoors, and regeneration never hurt anyone.. so maybe
one of those.  Either way, don't spend more than 6 points on the first
abilities.   Save your points after that.  The archtype abilities will help
you a great deal more than buying something right away, but you have to wait
until you're 55 to buy them.   You can save up to 100 advancement points, then
go on a shopping spree once you get your scale and level a few times.
