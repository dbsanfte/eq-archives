Hmm, I was just thinking this last night, too.  God could be
simpler than his creation.  But he'd have to be orders
of magnitude simpler for this arguement not to continue
to obtain.  So simple that he could "arise naturally" or
have "always existed" even though his more complex
creation could never have done so (nor could the conditions
for it to evolve have always obtained)

Someone further down the thread suggested that God was
relatively simple, and created the universe et all via
a good shake and chaos theory effects.  To me, though,
this pretty much says that life arose naturally after all, at
least in the ways that are important to the decision making
process.

This angle, though, also eliminates the creator from the "supreme
being" category... I mean, if he's simpler than a lab rat, or
for that matter a zooplankton, I can hardly look with awe and
worship upon him.  Even if you grant him near human
complexity (can't be quite as complex as us, mind you) He's on
the order of a kid playing with an erector set.  "Good job there
God, here's a nice lollypop, would be more the thing."

Another angle here would be that God is really a principle,
not an anthropomorhpic entity at all.  Perhaps if we work
backwards from the purported works of God, and combine
the principles we already understand, we can get to a greater
understanding of His nature.  Say, for example, the GUT,
which could be said to be the single equation which from which
all physical laws and therefore (given an understanding of the
original base state) all of the universe, including if you could
follow it closely enough the developement of life here locally.
This seems to me, though, no more than a restatement of the
"life can arise naturally" arguement, in which is buried "from
the principles we can observe."   There is no God but E=MC2
and Einstien is his Prophet (OK, so E=MC2 isnt' the GUT
but I was only being flip anyway)

There do seem to be some other options but that depends on
how loosely you want to define God.  I'm specifically argueing
against the complexity angle as a proof of a worshippable
supreme being, while there does seem to be some wriggle room
if you want to allow for some softer definitions of the term.

Nope... or yes, depending as I say, on what you mean by God

I think its cruicial to my arguement.  Some things
are too complex to arise naturally.  Life is one of those
things.  If God is at least as complex as life, then
he is also too complex to arise naturally -or- it
isn't true after all that some things are too complex
to arise naturally.

If God is simpler than Life, then he's not really all
that important in the grand scheme of things.

Those seem to me to be irrelevant attributes of Life, insofar
as the discussion at hand is concerned.  Whats germane is
how complex Life is, and whether that means that it cannot
have arisen naturally (or as I keep trying to add, the conditions
under which it arose have always obtained)

Is Life really tangible at all?  What about Souls (if any) or
Thoughts (maybe they are, as an engram coding we aren't
yet able to decipher)... and then what about the sophomoric
conclusion that we aren't really observing the universe at all
but rather just what our nerve endings are reporting?  Not
that I think those are really important to the discussion either
but just trying to demonstrate some ways in which Life can
be said to be a matter of intangibles, unobservable, and not
subject to natural laws.

Dude, thats the job of the person trying to tear down the arguement,
I'm just saying it can't be done with the facts internal to the case,
which of course are the only ones of importance.

A implies B
B implies C
A implies C
does C imply A?  Not enough information to decide within the arguement

Its certainly crucial to the arguement that we decide we can do so.
Thats one of the walnuts.  So lets look into it and see if the Pea
is hiding under it, today.

Hmm, other than the problems with terms that we are discussing
elsewhere, that pair you quote seems to be quite solid to me.

Remember, you don't have to accept it, you can always go with
the alternate conclusion that the creator can have come about
by chance after all... that only requires that you -also- accept
that Life itself can have arisen by chance after all, as well.  Not
that it -did- only that it -could- have.  Other alternatives are that
God is simpler than Life, or that somehow God and Life are
not interchangable in this way.

That last point is... I can't remember the terminology but its
a demand to discard logical algeabra as an approach to
theological discourse.  I don't say God and Life are identical
in all ways, I only want to say for the purposes of this
discussion that they are... CONGRUOUS thats the word I
think, that they share this attribute and can be substittued
equally well in to arguements that involve the things that
are "complex"

(Snip half the post, trying to seperate the two
lines of arguement)
