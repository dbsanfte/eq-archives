Look for a player smith that is auctioning to sell banded armor.  Usual prices
on E'ci tend to hover around 1 pp per armor class on it.  (I think.)

It's good armor, that in the old days would see people well into thier 30's.
Not saying you'll want to use it that long, just that you can get away with it
if you have to ; )
