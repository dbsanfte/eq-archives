If your druids and shaman have Incomplete Heal you aren't really in the "low
50s" anymore.

Cleric pets are also immune to AoE... all AoE, not just fire.  Nice, killing
a cleric mob using cleric tools.

Bard resists stack with cast and item resists, this helps a lot.

Your healing strategies concentrated on the MA, but this should be the least
of your worries  (particularly if you get a high level warrior in as a
ringer) .  As you say, DPS is the order of the day.  With the AE, though,
your low level (and probably low resist) people are going to start dropping
early and often.  Its important to keep as many of them alive as you can,
because if half your raid force drops dead, so does half your DPS.  Now it
takes longer to kill the target, so the AE kills even more people.  This is
why we stress resists, but it also means healers have to take the time to
keep their groups alive, instead of just chain healing the MA.

In melee fights, its quite common to just allow anyone besides the MA who
gets aggro to drop dead, you only lose a few DPS people that way... and they
should have maintained better aggro control.  In an AE fight, though,
letting things slide means losing the whole team, and that means losing the
fight.
