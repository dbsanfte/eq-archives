I'm pretty new to EQ (ok, so I've just gotten the game installed....) and
after much research, I have decided on either a cleric or a rogue.  I'd like
to have fun and socialize, but I don't want to battle my race or class on
the way up.  If I may ask a few questions of the veterans here...

How viable are the rogues skills other than backstabbing?  I know how
desirable it is to have a rogue for that purpose, but is there any other
reason to be a rogue?

I'm used to playing the warrior type in RPG's so is there any pertinent
information I need to know should I play something besides a warrior?

Thank you for any help, advice or information you can provide.
