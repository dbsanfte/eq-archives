Yes that is part of the problem the world is too big, there aren't 
enough people logged into to make a meaningful presense felt in most 
zones, but server consolidation isn't the solution yet.

Simply merging servers would simply double the number of people in the 
hot spots. If they want to make the rest of the world busier, they have 
to make the rest of the world more appealing in some fasion or other. Be 
it better loot, better cash, better xp, better quests, tradeskill 
drops... *something*.

People aren't going to flock to places that are strictly inferior in 
every regard to other places.. and that is an accurate description of 
most of EQ.
