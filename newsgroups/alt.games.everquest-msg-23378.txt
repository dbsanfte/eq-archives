Reminds me of some German ones.  in English if your hot, you
say I am hot, meaning I feel hot.  In German you Say Es ist
heiss zu mir or It is hot to me.  If you translate I am hot
directly, Ich bin heiss, it means I am sexually aroused. 
Opposite is also true, if you say Ich bin kalt, it means I
am frigid.
