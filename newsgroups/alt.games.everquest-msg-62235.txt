I changed my settings in the EQClient.ini to use the DirectX 8 DLL.

No real problem, everything runs fine, framerate is higher, graphics look
smoother, etc.
But for some reason my mouse-look is a LOT slower then before. Normal
mousemovement is at the same speed, but whenever I hold my right mousebutton
and want to turn around it goes way slow.

I've set mouse-speed to max in the options menu, put my MS mouse software (I
have an Intellimouse Explorer Optical, old version) to rediculous heights,
to rediculous lows, shut intellimouse software down completely and even
reinstalled the software, but all to no avail.

I'm at a loss at what to do now, the turn speed is so slow I can't manouver
decently in dungeons anymore, let alone do simple things like turn fast to a
mob when I know there is one.

Anyone encountered the same problems as I have, or know a solution?
My OS is win2k and my machine is above average.
