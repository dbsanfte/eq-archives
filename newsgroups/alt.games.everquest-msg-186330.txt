    As others have said, it's in the area where the zone to PoValor is, the
cave with the stones. The symbol on the Tactics stone is a compass (the math
one, not the finding directions one), it's the one furthest to the right
when you're facing into the cave. The zone out is down the stairs from the
zone-in. Memorize what the zone-out looks like, because if you ever get in
trouble in the pit there's a zone-out that looks just like it in the
northeast corner of the pit. Good luck - it's not a very forgiving zone.
