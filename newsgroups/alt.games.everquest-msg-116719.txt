Kinda the same thing on E. Marr last weekend.

Was kind of funny to see  a GM lead a double group
of 50+ folks down to Master Yael's room, release the locked
door there, and find a level 3 halfling rogue there
emoting about sweeping the floor and admonishing
them for making such a mess on their way through.

Travel down to there sometime and see  if you can
find my Hole mule Paramourte, with her new Broom
of Dirt slaying, rogue-usable 2hb, 1/45, +50 bane
damage agains Dirt.
