It is a pretty recognizable pattern.

Paladul Caverns is on Luclin, entrances from Hollowshade Moor, Shadeweaver's
Thicket, and Shadowhaven.  The Shadowhaven end is well over your head at the
moment, but either of the other two entrances will have mobs that start easy for
you (maybe too easy, green) and gradually get harder the further in you go.

You may have some trouble finding groups in there at the lower levels, as many
people don't know they -can- start at any end but the SH end, and think its a 18+
zone... but you'll level up so fast soloing that you'll reach those 18+ levels soon
enough that you won't notice.

If you are stuck on grouping at lower levels, I did also advise looking for people
near your level and going there... thats not really the same as saying Paladul,
although it will look that way when you reach the 18 to 25 range.
