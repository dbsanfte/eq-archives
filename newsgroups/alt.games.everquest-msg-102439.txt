Ran into a bizarre (though not terribly lethal) bug with the new chat
channels this weekend. Wanted to see if anyone has seen the same or
found a fix.

Taking a raid over to DN we got to WW and had already set up a raid
channel. As usual, some mob wanders by the egress spot, get's the walrus
types all worked up, and the fight is on.

One of the clerics had modified her healing hot key to say,
"/1 Complete heal for %t coming in ten seconds."  Of course, she's got
me targeted. But what I (and most of the raid) actually read is,
"Alarea tells raidchannel 1 'Complete heal for a_walrus_01 coming in ten
seconds.' "
A little more investigation showed that the people who did *not* have
the mob targeted (chanter casting haste on one of the rogues) saw
"Complete heal for Rogue_01 coming in ten seconds."  Obviously confusion
and hilarity result.

It turned out that when you used a hot key with %t in it, everyone heard
the message return the value of %t as what *YOU* have targeted, not what
the speaker has targeted. So I heard the name of the mob I had targeted
instead of my name. The cleric was healing me as intended, but just the
message was fucked up.

Anyone else notice this and/or find a workaround? We /bugged it, for
whatever that's worth.
