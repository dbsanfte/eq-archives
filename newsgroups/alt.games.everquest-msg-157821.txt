Its a bullshit item. Just an item in the database that people
display by hacking in the item number in a chat. Old news.
There is also an item that has 10k hit point and mana.

There is no way Verant/Sony could allow a ranger to own
and use that weapon.

Can you imagine the damage you could unleash with
the trueshot discipline? OMFG!
