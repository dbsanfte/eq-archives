At level 30, with highly non uber gear, my warrior can solo effectively, if
he is extremely careful about the mobs he picks.  So far, I have found
exactly one mob type in exactly one zone that he can very effectively solo.
He can kill four or five of them from full health without too much concern,
so long as there are no adds.  They are highly social however.  After that,
bandage up to half, and do a couple more.  He can keep that up pretty well
until bandages run out.  My druid, who is only 15, with even less uber gear
than the warrior can easily solo yellows, with significant downtime in
between, or, can solo dark blues in a wide variety of zones at higher rate
than the warrior.  The warrior takes a while to kill things, as he has no
haste item yet.  My druid is at a highly uber wisdom of 137 right now.
