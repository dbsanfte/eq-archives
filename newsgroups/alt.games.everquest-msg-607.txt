I keep trying to find the NPC who is in the Freeport side of the mail
delivery quest (Highpass Keep to Freeport) but can't find them.  Where are
they standing at?  Also can I repeatedly do this quest (LV7) and not have to
worry about screwing up any factions?  I'm a halfling druid.

Also does anybody know where in Freeport I can buy containers?  Mainly just
to stick in the bank for holding (sow weight isn't a problem).
