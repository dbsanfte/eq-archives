From the shadows, the mysterious Dan Day <dday@houston.rr.com> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

I'm not so sure its average. I think its the total amount of data sent
since the last report to server. There's several bits of evidence for
this. Three especially - when you have a near-linkdeath experience the
number shoots very high for one check. That doesn't seem like an
average, that sounds like everything coming at once. But better
example - nexus when no one is in it and you're not doing anything.
You can actually see the packetloss bar creep up to 30% or more - but
its not really packetloss at all, there's simply nothing to report, no
packets being sent (it clicks back down to 0% when the server pings
the client as it does on regular intervals to check position). However
the last number doesn't change in the meantime. It should be at 0 if
it were an average. Finally, with one of the rarer forms of linkdeath
(going out of sync), you see the final number climbing higher and
higher while everything else seems to stop responding. I think its
reporting the total info sent since its last successful return (since
if it was average the number would hold steady), and because the
server isn't responding properly to the info being sent (you've gone
out of sync), it just keeps trying (this will eventually stop, either
by switching to normal linkdeath with the packetloss number climbing
until it either recovers or 100%, or you recover and everything goes
back to normal).

Otherwise I think you're more or less right.
