Either they are a child or are just an ass.. I've never met a cleric
whos that rude. Pdots are expensive, and yes, its frustrating but
around the lvl 40 area, they wont be using Dots, so they can go jump..
I seem to recall its jaspers on my lvl 40. They're a few gp each, if
they cant wear that for the 1 cast per member as generally it will
last a LDoN and maybe a couple more if people die.. then, well.. We
did one last night, we got about 55pp out of the split each.. Id say,
that more than covers it.
