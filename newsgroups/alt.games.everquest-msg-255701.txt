A friend remarked that he had gotten tired of trying to get his
current Spell Research skill-up from making spells, so he looked
at using a training point to raise the skill instead, and found
it would cost him 44 plat.  (I don't know if he paid it. :-)

That got me to wondering how much it costs to use training points
in general.  I poked around a bit and found it doesn't seem to
depend on the skill, or the character class; all characters pay
the same to raise any skill from 100 to 101, etc.  (Not all skills
can be raised using training points, of course.)  But I couldn't
find anyone who'd posted a formula for the cost.

So I took 3-4 characters to their trainers and wrote down all the
different training costs I could find, then played with the numbers
enough to decide they looked like a cubic curve, picked four points
to determine the curve, solved the equation, tweaked it a bit to
make it use round numbers, and voila! -- I found a formula that
matched exactly for all 55 skill levels I'd gotten data for.

Since I've never felt the urge to register to be able to post on any
of the web sites like Alla's or the various class-specific sites,
I'm posting my formula here.  Anybody who feels like it can spread
it around in other places so it'll be easier to find.

As for what it's good for, well, it means you can tell in advance
how expensive it'll be to raise a skill all the way to 250 (or any
other goal) using training points.  You can plan ahead for where
the cutover point is where training points become more expensive
than blowing components on practicing Research.  There are probably
other uses, but mostly I was just curious so I worked it out. :-)

Anyway, the formula is:

	10 x [((LEVEL / 10) - 1) ^ 3]

rounded down, in coppers, but never less than zero of course, where
LEVEL is your current skill level.  So going from 175 to 176, for
instance, would cost 44pp 9gp 2sp 1cp.  (16.5 cubed, times 10, is
44921.25.)  Going from skill 0 to skill 250 using just training
points would run you a total of 8225pp and change.

We now return you to your regularly scheduled discussion of Brenlo's
mighty hammer. :)
