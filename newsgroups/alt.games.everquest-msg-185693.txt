Okey... Now that I've successfully resisted the impulse to flame you, 
here's the straight story:

Nobody is pushing african-american vernacular as an "official language", 
whatever that is, but recognized as a dialect, which it is, as opposed 
to a slang, which it isn't.

Nobody is trying to have it "taught in schools" (unless it's as part of 
a linguistics course), but rather establish that people who speak it are 
speaking a non-standard form of English, as opposed to "bad English", 
and use this fact as a learning aid when it comes to teaching them the 
standard form.

How would you like to hear that American English is "slang" and "bad 
English"? Lots of Brits still think that, and the origin of American 
English isn't really any different than the origin of AAV, it just 
happened earlier.

Here's a couple of links for you, from people who know what they are 
talking about:
