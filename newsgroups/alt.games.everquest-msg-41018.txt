> We all know who did it or at least oversaw it full well.

No, we don't.  We have several good suspects, other then that we are simply
jumping to conclusions.  Now, the person that everyone is blaming has done
several horrible things in the past, and if he was taken out and shot I
would not really shed a tear.  However, if we did that, we may well allow
the true perpetriator to get off scott free.  Don't allow a blind anger
reaction to stem true justice, or vengence.  Attacking him at this point
could well make it impossible to prove who did do it.  Not to mention cause
an immeserable amount of strife between the US, our Allies, and anyone who
would see us as acting prematurely without any real evidence or information.
