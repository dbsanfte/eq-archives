Which is fine when everyone knows what you are talking about. Problem is, websites
and other sources of information use the "official name" in refering to places.
Someone looking for info on Wisp Island will find it referenced under "Erud's
Crossing"; if they look up "Kerra Island", they will be seriously misled :-)

Happened to me. I was told that Beholder's Maze was great hunting for upper teen
druids. Couldn't find anything about it so I chose instead the Gorge of King
Xorbb. Was there three days before learning that that IS the Maze.
