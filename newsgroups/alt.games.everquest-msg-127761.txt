I'm playing a Vah Shir Rogue in Shadeweaver's Thicket. I trained 6 points
in Pick Pocket promptly when I dinged 7. Whenever I'm fighting a mob and
the button highlights I turn off autoattack, pick pockets, turn on autoattack.
Well, I'm halfway through level 9 now (about 6 hours of play later), and
I've never gotten a success, nor have I gotten a skill increase. What
gives?

Can't pickpocket mobs from the front? Can't do it if you're on their hate
list?  Skill increases only checked if the mob has loot? (if so, I'm hosed
there!) Too impatient? Random number generator hates me? Only works on
mobs with pockets?

Rookie rogue wants to know!

PS: any places you can practice Pick Lock on the moon?
