Hmm and have items like fungi tunics regen 1 hp at level 1 , 10 at 10 ,
etc..
( umm don't read this as the numbers I used just the concept )
An interesting game concept rather than a recommended and/or required level.
After all items Like Potc earring do this now if under rec level. add a
point of skill every few levels.

And I suppose if they wanted to redesign EQ into a different game they
could.
Added items like this to prevent twinking was implemented late in the game
but nerfing existing items hasn't occurred

Would such massive widespread nerfing of Kei/aego/fungi's etc be a good
business model ?
I don't think so. But then I think the harm done by any nerfing is never
recovered from.
People will work hard invest etc and be happy to make a thousand bucks BUT
***the intensity of emotion*** is much higher if the same folk lose a
thousand bucks.
Game balancing using a take away method is dumb. IMNSHO.
