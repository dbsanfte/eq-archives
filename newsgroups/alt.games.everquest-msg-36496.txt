My inner Druid is stalled at level 5 and I am having trouble going back 
to him. There is something soooo humiliating about swinging at a bat
10' over my head. The whiffing sound is broadcast to the whole forest
and all I hear is uproarious giggles from every other animal within miles.
I just know they share the laugh with all of their buddies. I'm sure I see
paws pointing at me and muffled laughs even when I go somewhere I've 
never been before.

My inner Shadow Knight has emerged to wipe the smirks off their faces !

Jim
