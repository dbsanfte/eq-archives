You have probably had bad luck with your timing.  I played for a few hours
last night before I went to bed.  This would have been in between patches.
Possibly, your attempts to login have been during one of those patches or
during the massive logjam at the login server immediately afterward.  But to
set you at ease a bit, EQ is alive and well.  Or alive anyway.

As for manaburn, it is an alternate advancement ability available to
wizards.  It has a number of prerequisites, not the least of which is that
the character must be at least level 59 to learn the skill.  Once learned,
the skill allows the wizard to convert all of his or her mana into a direct
damage blast against whoever he or she has targetted.

This skill takes approximately 6 seconds from pushing the hotkey to delivery
of damage, and the damage incurred seems to be at a rate of maybe 2.5 points
damage for every point of mana used.  Since wizards at that level tend to
have around 3000 points of mana (sometimes a good bit more), damage from
this skill on a full bar of mana will usually run in the 7000 to 8000 points
range, not counting critical blasts.

The damage is unresistable, so if 5 such wizards attacked any Kunark or Old
World monster (32K hp max), they needed only make sure they all manaburned
simultaneously, and the monster would be dead literally without having had a
single round of attacks to defend itself.  No buffs necessary, no agro
management, no organization, just 5 buttons pressed and it's time to loot
the dragon.  Like shooting fish in a barrel (no risk, no challenge, just the
loot).  Some folks took it even farther and gathered larger forces of
manaburn wizards to kill Velious dragons.

Verant's fix was to cause manaburn to "buff" the mob for 1 minute to make it
immune to further manaburns.  Now Gorenaire (seemingly a favorite of the
manaburn set) gets one manaburn for 8k and for the next minute you have 24K
remaining of angry dragon before the next manburn will stick.  By the time
the buff wears off, the manaburn group will be at their respective bind
points, memming Combine Gate for the corpse run.  That is, unless they bring
in a levitated bard to kite her in between burns.  Even then, if the 1
minute enforced pause lets her regen catch up enough, all bets are off.

That's pretty much the manaburn saga in a nutshell.  I cannot swear there
are no errors in what's written here, but it will surely give you a pretty
good idea how it works.
