Raise your Rogue faction by killing the Butcherblock
Bandits.  There are two camps.  There is a camp with peg leg
not too far from the docks.  as you head towards kaladim
from the docks there will be a tombstone with a guard
standing by it on your right.  Turn to your right and follow
the left hand wall of this valley.  it will take you to the
camp with peg leg.  The other camp is between the Crossroads
and the twin merchant huts towards G'fay.  About 1/2 way in
between as you head towards g'fay from the crossroads on
your left is an opening in the mountains, inside this cove
is a bandit camp and a orc camp (avoid the orcs if you want
to maintain good faction with neriak/nek forest).  The
bandits are along the left hand wall as you enter the cove
follow it around, and you will come to the bandit camp. 
Killing these bandits raises both guard and rogue faction. 
all of the Dunfires in the camps drop tongues, if you turn
in those tongues plus the one from rondo dunfire in
crushbone, you can raise it higher once you are beyond
dubious.  The reward is dwarf rogue only and no drop i
think, but your after faction not reward.
