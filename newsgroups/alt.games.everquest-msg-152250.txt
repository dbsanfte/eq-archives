Wow I dont venture here often.  Think I wont again.

I dont like to use harsh language but shoot think its sort of an
obligation in this case.  Poster says I'm an idiot because I think
druids hard to level.  Poster has low level druid that is not even at
the quad stage.  Poster says all druids are idiots  lol.   Think he's
looking at himself.

I know EQ very very well.  Not even going to argue about that.  Take
it or leave it.  But dont call me an idiot.  And get your own druid to
60 before you make futher comments on viability.

For leveling pleasure its necro.  With mage in close second place. 
This is talking solo.  I have never done melee so cant comment.  But
for the stoopid fools who think druid is easy solo leveler, sheesh. 
Cant convince you and cant talk to you and really cant do anything but
ignore.

At high levels, everything changes.  But I have a suspicion that high
level talk is not really appropriate to this board.
