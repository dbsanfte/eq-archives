So I went back to Orc 1 tonight for my corpse and immeditely jumped in with a
group there. This group experience was 10 times better than the last one i was
moaning about ;)
Me being the only pure caster and a few tank/hybrids (my pet included) I used
the advice from the responses to my last post and it turned out to be a very
efficent group, and a helluva lot of fun to play in. The tanks pulled well and
always a "inc" popped up while i was medding. We killed orcs by the shitload
without a single death and in around 2 and a half hours i was oom only once. I
thought our group did really well last night and i dinged 11 aswell as getting
in alot of faction work. In fact every group member dinged which was great. I
learned not to over cast on mobs and limit to one Dot and 2 or 3 DD's. This way
my mana is hardly ever below half and if it does drop i use dark pact. I figure
with those spells and my pet melle'ing im pulling my weight in the group.
It did go a bit bad at the end though: we pulled a leggionaire and another orc
popped and just for good measure a kodiak joined in. At this point we were a 3
man team and the tanks were taking a whupping. I feared the leggo but it
dropped immediately, he aggroed on me, the kodiak died and my last images were
of a big ass orc busting my chops while both tanks hacked at its back trying to
get it off me though they were both about a third health themselves. I died but
i dont care because it was a great group. Thanks again to all those who gave
good advice about grouping on the other thread.
