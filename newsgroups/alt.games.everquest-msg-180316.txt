Just as followup, is there a generic "unrefined ore block"? What the
gnolls in Blackburrow drop are "unrefined iron ore blocks" and that is
what I was using, is there a difference? After the combine, they
become refined iron blocks or something like that.

Looking at what Yakum sells, it looks like MQ or HQ ore blocks (or
metal blocks) [generic?]. Not HQ steel blocks (I may be mistaken).
That got me to thinking about this.

I have been trying to figure out if there is anywhere I can find those
[generic] unrefined ore blocks (if they exist).

I had hoped to get faction, xp, and some money from this so I am still
seeking answers. If the definitive answer is I am out of luck, then
okay I can move on.

A 10th lvl human Ranger thanks all who provide counsel on this matter.
