Just so you know, dude...  GMs aren't techs.  Guides aren't techs either.
Guides are players who play the game.  Some guides are even computer geeks
like Sean and I.  However, being computer geeks, doesn't necessarily mean
that we know all the idiosyncracies of everyone's problems.  A good example
is Tribes 2.  I love the game, haven't had a problem.  Does it mean other
people won't have problems with their setup or their wiring?  No.  Does it
mean the Guides on EQ should understand or be able to troubleshoot your
problems?  No.  Does it mean the GMs in question should troubleshoot your
problems, despite the fact that GMs did try with what little they knew or
informed about?  No.  Does it give you the right to then state they are
useless or idiots or some such, when you, yourself, should know the limits
of a human being, and now knowing the fact that said human beings there
might actually not know such things, given that Guides are players, GMs are
not techs and then call us wankers and assume we don't have characters over
30?

Here's a little hint for you.  Some of us 'wankers' post from work, when we
have breaks.  Where responding to a newsgroup is safer than say...  Playing
EQ with its graphics pretty damn obvious in design, that it doesn't look
like a response to someone's e-mail message.  I know it is a hard thing to
grasp that some of us could actually post while doing something productive
such as working, or be able to write a post message in a short time span
where our reading comprehension and spelling skills are above that of a
junior high school level.

And to add to a final note.  I have 1 character above 50, thank you very
much.  I also run 7 other characters, 4 of which are 20 to 22 in level, and
3 I just haven't made much of an effort to push beyond 18, 14 and 11
respectively because of my focus on my 50+ and the other 4 levels.  So
please note sometime, that some of us 'wankers', as you so put it...  Can
equally vent back at you, with a bit more purpose and fact than you can,
especially in the case for the GMs and Guides (Which some of us hate for
other reasons) due to the fact you show ignorance about them as you do
about us, and rightly deserve to be smacked around a few times.
