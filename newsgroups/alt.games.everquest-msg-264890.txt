   True enough.  I actually stopped play for about two months before I
stopped paying.  Well, I did roll up a baby druid and try to play again for
a couple of hours, but felt such complete apathy to the project I actually
surprised I could ever feel that way about EQ.

   This thought is the main one that gave me the strength to push that
"Cancel account" button.

   I'm actually fairly ambivalent to the FAQ right now.  I really don't
think that it should be in hands of someone that doesn't play.  There may
very well be changes in this regard.  As for the rest, well, I've been
accused of being cranky lately, and maybe it's true.

    You could get one of those huge Winnebego (sp?) things.  You know, the
house you can drive!  Get a satellite hookup for internet access on the
thing and you'd be in business (Um, not that I know if a satellite hookup
works for playing online graphical games).  Plus, you'd instill a sense of
horror on every driver behind you when they realize that you're ahead of
them.  Especially fun when there is no passing lane.

   There just doesn't seem to be a downside.
