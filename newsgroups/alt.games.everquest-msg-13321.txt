I'll remember that, next time it someone roots the mob I'm chasing down, so
it can turn and beat on me. Thankyou for nearly getting me killed.
I freely admit as I said in my post, that yesterdays event was a
misunderstanding and although it incovenienced me I wasn't really in any
danger which was why I held my "tongue" I knew that by my mood I'd prolly
say something unnecassary.

Again, that fits for yesterdays case, I only used 2 accounts because they
were so close together and the same mob, this doesn't happen everytime I
play or everytime I solo but it does happen enough.

Unlikely, although I see your point and knew someone would raise it. I don't
/yell  for help, I can normally run to zones safely, if not I'll make my way
to a spot I can retrieve my corpse from. This is probably my own foolish
pride coming thru in game but if I die from something it's "normally" by my
own choices. Only people I expect to bail me out is my group but if I am in
that much trouble, I normally ask *them* to bail.

I don't ask for it both ways, I consider that  maybe there should be thought
before action.

It now certainly sounds like I am really whining about this. The first
example is the one that bothers me, the second is only listed as it was so
close in time and same mob (basically the second time I take on a griffon,
it gets rooted)  The caster was high enough to stick a spell on a Griffon
I'd expect he was high enough to realise how a rooted mob reacts when being
melee, if he wanted to finish it he could have just nuked it, he did that
anyway but the root just put me in danger.
So yes I am whining about that event and I am not impressed by his reply
"Haha.." If he'd said "Fuck you, I was trying to help" I could at least
believe that maybe he was.
As for the druid although I wasn't insulting I am probably off her Xmas card
list and she is probably hoping to see me running passed yelling for help or
a chance to watch me die. Well, she can hang around NK, I'm sure I'll run
across Grimfeather sooner or later but I won't be expecting help from
anyone, the term Solo means just that to me.

The third Griffon I killed cleanly now I just need to sit and heal a bit,
hmmm I wonder if any druids in the zone might... ;ï¿½)
