Bah, 40 is fast as a bard.  You have your upgraded charm song, so now you 
can really solo well.  Learn to charm kite, and when you get that down, 
learn to swarm-kite.  With practice you can get to where you can take out 
4 mobs ever couple minutes.  It's risky, and if you go LD, you die, but if 
you have a good, solid connection, it's the fastest way to get exp.
A good place to practice is the frost giants in Great Divide.  
If you're playing off-hours, you might want to check out Rathe Mtns too.  
I never swarm-kited there, but just charm-kiting could clear the entire 
zone of HGs and be waiting for respawn.  You can only do it for two or 
three cycles before the druids start whining, but it's fun until then.
