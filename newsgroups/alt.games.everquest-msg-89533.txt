My 52 paladin with ghetto gear can make about 180pp per hour farming HGs.
And there's almost always competition on my server, even during off-hours.
He can make up to 150pp per hour crawling in Sol A, that's the only other
good spot I've found (having a merchant to offload all that FS and ore helps
immensely).  I still think 20pp, including FS, words, and other loot is
about average for HGs but I admit I haven't collected statistics (I'm also
destroying silver and copper and converting the coins to rubies with the gem
merchant in zone so I lose some money there; you druids can just port to
Misty and have a banker right near by :p).
