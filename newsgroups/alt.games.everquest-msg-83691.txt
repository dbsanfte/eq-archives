Probably true, depending on glitches and lag and such
(when I took 10k damage, I seemed to "hang" halfway
down for a second or two -- maybe the game though I was
falling a *long* way to be in the air that long).

But I petitioned and the GM gave me an exp rez, telling me
that it wasn't *supposed* to happen.
