I'd kill (well .. almost) for a good used book store/coffee shop.  We have
one used book store in town ... it's roughly the size of a walk-in closet,
and the folks who run it have rather unique views on things like genre and
alphabetical order.

At a time in my life when I traveled for my work, I was in a midwestern city
that seemed to have a used book store on every other corner.  They even had
specialized used books stores ... I remember one that catered to romances,
one that catered to horror, and two that I visited frequently ... one that
catered to sci-fi/fantasy, and the other that catered to books on history.
It was the best part about the city (other than the people ... the people
there were great to work with and be around).
