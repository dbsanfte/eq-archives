Pardon, what other source....  both  the autowhine and the Odd
statement come from you...  If not somone is spoofing your name and
posting location?

If you expand the whole thread agian, as I just did, both those
comments come from a poster know as Dark Tyger...

so you went into superior mode with the autowhine part... so you did
to the preemptive strike....   or would you prefer stryke? 8 )

It is ok man.... chill out, you can be wrong and still be one of the
good guys...
