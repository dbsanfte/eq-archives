Ooohhh. Yeah I bet you had a great time Quad-Soloing from 1-34.....Oh
wait.....Wizards can't quad-kite effectively until 34. So how did you
level that far, and did you do it without melees and healers? Yeah
right.

Wow you must be a really exceptional Wizard.....You must never get
resisted. Your root must never break, and you must never get an Add
when fighting. Yeah, right

LOL! I didn't code the game, and neither did you. Hundreds of
thousands of players will completely disagree with your findings. I
doubt you are somehow more enlightened than the vast majority of them.

"with 1 tank"

Point my favor

>Outdoors, an AE group doesn't even need the
>tank, or the stunners or healers for that matter.

No, but you need Jboots, Tboots or Sow Potions, and a Zone-line to run
to when you get resists or go OOM.

>No, wizards get effective AE starting at level 1. At later levels
>their AE gets godly, but early on it can still be used.

OK, name the time place and server, and show me a level 1 Wizard AE 4
rats successfully in the Newbie area of Freeport, Felwithe or Qeynos
without dieing or running to the guards.

>Pillar of frost is godly. I do 755 dmg to 4 different mobs for 300
>mana. That's over 3000 HP dmg from one 300 mana spell.

With NO resists if you are lucky.

"the tank"

Point my favor

>By the time the tank is finishing up the first mob, I've got the 3

Bull*&^^. No single tank can taunt 4 mobs at once while you knock them
down to 10%. Are you forgetting an Enchanter in that group? or perhaps
additional tanks, rooters, pets? Or were you exploiting a pathing bug,
and the mobs couldn't reach you?

>Using point blank AE, the damage ratios get truly absurd. I've read of

You're the one smoking bud. "I've read of some wizards doing 15K+ HP
damage from ONE spell!" Yeah, and I've read that Elvis is pumping gas
in Ojai. I never said Wizards were not valued. I said they were not
the first choice in a pick-up group. You should hone your debate
skills beyond the 1st grade level.

"I was the only person in the group casting AE"

So what was the make-up of the rest of the group? Any tanks or
healers? Ah insults. The last resort of the truly desparate. 

Game, Set, Match. 

You are the weakest link.....Good-Bye!

Again you show your lack of reading comprehension. I said "the
impression that you have not played EQ for very long" You are simply
not capable of ration debate, nor are you "clued" into how EQ is
played if you subscribe to the beliefs you have professed in this
exchange. 

You believe in the holy mantra of AE groups, and are completely blind
to the facts staring you in the face. 

In closing I direct your attention to the recent change in "The Grey"
on Luclin. AE groups were killing mobs in insane numbers. What did
Verant do? They upped the resists and forced players back into the
"typical exp grind" that you seem to hate so much.

Thank you for playing. Remember your coat and hat on the way out.
