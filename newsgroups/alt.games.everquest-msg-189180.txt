Gosh. offhand I would suggest that you delete the EQHARDWARE file in you
Everquest directory.  Don't worry silly, it won't mess up your computer or
game, it will just force EverQuest to remake that file by asking you what
you have in your computer.  Does this lockup happen when you're not playing
EQ?  if it does, then you may have a bad ram stick (take it out and see if
problem persists) or you may have a heat problem AMD chips do run hotter
than Intels, and that GeForce 4 is a hot running card too.  did you
uninstall your previous video card completely? (Meaning change video to SVGA
card and uninstall drivers, then reboot machine)?

DirectX up to date?

Good luck!
