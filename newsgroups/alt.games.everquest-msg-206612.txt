Once upon a time, you could zone out near death, and get a pretty good 
bonus, not only would you stop whatever that mob was from beating on 
you, but you'd get a free heal of sorts in the bargain (you'd have all 
your gear based HP restored) but you took a substantial penalty for it, 
all buffs were stripped.  A possible exploit of sorts since it also 
stripped off  DOTs for you, and I've seen it used for that purpose, near 
death with a DOT on you could always survive by losing all buffs.

But then they changed the system so it no longer strips DOTs... -or- 
buffs.  I hadn't really thought about this much, only zoning out in real 
emergencies and at that point not really caring about buffs or not, nor 
getting a partial heal... just living was good enough either way.  If 
anything it did make zoning out a bit more likely since I wouldn't lose 
those precious buffs.

Just yesterday, though, I saw an iksar warrior fighting several orcs at 
the Kith zone line in HHP.  No way he could expect to handle them all.  
But he chewed one up, then zoned out (at 5% hp) then zoned back in 
almost immediately with 71% hp to kill the next.  It occurs to me that 
without a pet, there's no real penalty to zoning out, and with a fast 
system, thats a faster heal rate even than having a cleric PL you; just 
zone out and back in and keep on fighting.  My warrior had to make do 
with binding his wounds up to 50%, a tedious process; with HP gear (and 
he had lots) and a Temperance on, zone line heal would be a vast 
improvement in lowereing down time.

Of course I suppose you'd be constantly on the lookout for someone 
reporting you for exploiting the zone line... but didn't they open 
themselves up for this sort of thing by removing the "strips your buffs" 
side effect?
