Root mob out of aggro range, then atone.  If you aren't in its path, this
works great to eliminate adds.

A modification I picked up in this newsgroup recently, after the recent
fixes to the Lull line:

Root mob.  Use your best single target lull on it. Atone.

Now it doesn't matter that the mob might be in aggro range, since you cut
its range down drammatically, with high level lulls, to zero.

This means the mob is better than mezed, you can throw around heals and
Cheals and battle with his brothers, anything you like, until someone casts
a spell that directly affects the mob, or hits it, it will ignore
everything.
