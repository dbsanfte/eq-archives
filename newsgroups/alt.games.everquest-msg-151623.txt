Only one on a blue server?  Or do you mean only one on a Zek server?  Ah,
neither here nor there.

Sixteen characters...are you freakin' outta your mind? :)  Don't you have
any favorites?  What is the average level of the 8 highest level characters
you have?

Force yourself to concentrate on your favorite 4 characters.  Get them up a
few levels.  I suspect you're average to the previous question is around 16.
Characters don't get interesting until late 20s usually...one of those 4
characters should really start striking your fancy soon enough.
