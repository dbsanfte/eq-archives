1. "Martyrs Day" by Michael Kelly
2. " A Cambodian Odyssey" by Dr. Haing Nor. I threw that one in because I
want to see what you have to say when he said, in the book, that he wished
the US would send B 52's to bomb the Khmer Rouge. This was of cousres after
they made him watch his wife die in childbirth. Actually it is a great book
one you should not miss. Now as I said I much prefer to read than educate
you knotheads. Bye Bye.
