I am wondering how many of the tanks (not class specific) who can't *keep* agro
aren't using taunt???   There are times my cleric and chanter BF will do an
LDoN mission and never get agro.  We'll get a new tank for the next mission and
all the sudden we can't get RID of agro.  
*My* warrior has always kept taunt maxed out & I can honestly say I've never
had to go pry the mob off the caster - he carries a frostbringer (that won't
proc) and a centi longsword at level 28.
