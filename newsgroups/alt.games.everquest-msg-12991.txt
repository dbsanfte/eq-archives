	Well, to be fair, pulling became risky after the FD nerf pre-Kunark.
Throw rug became the only viable way to split MOBs with little risk, and
that involved having the monk /q out after he dropped in a lot of
circumstances.

	Velious did it right. If you want to nerf FD pulling, you don't
nerf FD, you nerf the pathing so that all MOBs reset at the same time. Some
MOBs reset split, so FD pulling goes back to a throw rug or waiting for
reset if you can get 'em out far enough, but a lot of the really tough pulls
are completely reliant on the fact that MOBs run at different speeds.

	I don't fight in SS unless I'm on my way to Yelinak, and then
you don't need to worry about multiple MOBs, really.

	For AC/HP comparisons, with fairly good stuff:

	class		AC		HP
	-----		--		--
	ROG		1200+		2300+
	WAR		1250+		3500+
	MNK		1150+		2200+

	Some people with amazing stuff manage to beat these, but the above
values should be attainable for any fairly powerful guild. As a datapoint,
I haven't broken 1100 AC yet, but I am close. In contrast, our rogues have
close to 1200 or more, and our warriors are all above 1250.

	My stuff isn't amazing, but it is good, and I've gone for a mix
of AC and HP as I deemed appropriate, which lowers my score a bit. Also,
I'm only 56, and by 60, I'll be 1100+ AC and 2300+ HP with my current gear.

>exactly is it a waste?

	Because you could bring a rogue and multiply each monk by 1.5 in
terms of damage, that's why. With primal and priceless velium and max haste
a 60 monk will do about 65 dmg/sec or so. In contrast, a rogue will do the
/same/ from the front and from the back will go up to about 110 dmg/sec
(with primal in primary and RB in offhand). Wars also do the same amount
of damage. With aggresive, one of our warriors did a bit under 100 dmg/sec
on Nanzata with primal in primary and warrior epic in offhand.

	So, really, you could replace that monk with a warrior and get the
same damage without the discipline, but better AC and HP (which makes them
more mana efficient), and on big fights you could have your non-tanks use
aggresive and do /more/ damage than a monk. Innerflame only lasts for 12
seconds, and doesn't add more than a few dmg/sec over a fairly long fight
(2 mins or more).

	Couple that with how rare primal hammers are vs. warswords, and
there's really no compelling reason to have a monk at the top level game
past a couple of them as CR insurance. The only place I pull anymore on
events is North Wing TOV, and only because I have a small chance of living
with FD. But an SK can do the same thing, and their top level FD has NO
chance of failing, whereas mine seems to have gone up since hitting 190
skill.
