Heh, this is my favorite combo right now bard-bard.  I do three dots, he
does slow and fear.  We can mix in selos, heals, extra dots, as fizzles
allow, but it's really fast killing this way with no down time.  When we
group, one doing melee buffs in battle and one doing full time mana and
health regen, really makes the group happy.

Plus it makes so many pretty sparkles...And your clothes could match so
nicely...
