Wish I could answer your question, but I don't have time to try DAoC myself.
I don't have the phone number to call, but if it's a 1-800, 888, or 877
number, then it is toll free to the caller.  Nothing to apologize about as
to your English skills, they are significantly better than many who claim it
as their native tongue.
