Negative, thats one of the worst ways to see if someone is trolling, its the
content of the post that is important.

Some of the best trolls use full proper english.

Internet shorthand, and or bad english does not instantly mean someone is an
idiot troll, lazy maybe (or efficient?), but thats nothind to do with
trolling.

The internet is international, you cant judge people by your own standards
all the time, the bad english guy may be korean with 2 weeks english
teaching under his belt, but he may also be the next Einstien.

What annoys me is when somebody has a valid argument, but people will
dismiss it as trolling rather than actually discuss it, sure there are real
trolls, but avoiding debate by calling someone a troll is almost as bad.

Meh gotta stop rambling
