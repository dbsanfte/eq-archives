Shamans have Debuffs, debuffs seem to matter much much more against players.

Enchanters can charm at level 8 I think, but you better have sow and be near
a zoneline, and by then you will have some of the basic charm soloing tools
(Root, color flux, mez... when I was charm soloing in the 40s I used those
specific abilities... root, cf, mez. Didn't need the big guns)
What you lack for good charm soloing are good haste, but the advantage is
those pansy runes are cheap and fairly effective at that level.

What I'd bet is you will see some of those are a team. Enchanter-Shaman is a
good combo when you only have breeze for mana regen. Mage would be a good
addition, solid pets.
