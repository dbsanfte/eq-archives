Hi guys,

I'm a little stuck at the moment trying to decide what I shall hunt. I'm 
  almost level 22 (about a yellow from) and am finding it fairly easy to 
level up and get experience. My problem is that I don't really have 
great (I'm far from twinked imho- I don't wear anything worth more than 
about 100pp, unless the Sarnak-Hide Mask given to me at about lvl 8 by 
someone who couldn't sell it and didn't want it is worth more).

So what I'm trying to do is find a place where I can hunt for either 
good PP or actual weapons and items themselves. Someone told me to try 
the lower level of Kurn's Tower, but a couple of people told me that the 
place got changed in an update and is now level 30+?

Any help would be appreciated,

Thanks
