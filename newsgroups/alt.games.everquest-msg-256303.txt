We're all subject to the same RNG (I think...  sometimes I wonder).

Read up some on the mitigation nerf that happened to monks the month before
PoP came out.  That mitigation change is *in addition* to the "hard" softcap
on AC that only monks suffer.

A simple way of describing it would be that everybody except warriors and
monks roll a 1d20 for how much damage they take when a mobs hit them. 
Warriors roll a 1d20-1, with their innate mitigation bonus, and monks roll a
1d20+(1d6*2).  The rolls are modified by AC, but referring to the "hard"
softcap on monk AC mentioned previously, monks cannot have enough AC to
influence the rolls much at higher levels.  That doesn't quite do justice to
what's happening, but it gives an idea of the actual results.  I don't get
hit for a higher max hit, but I'm a lot more likely than any
(similarly-AA'ed) class to get hit for a string of max hits.
