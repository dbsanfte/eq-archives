my fried(plays a druid) was able to stack his 'swarm' line of spells after
he hit 51, I tried to do the same at 42 and got the message about unable to
stick the second spell .. and the necro and sk spells will land as long as
they dont try to stack 2 spells in the same line that are of different
levels ... example necro casts the 12th lv darkness spell, the sk casts the
4th lvl ... the sk spells should be bounced.  Mind you I haven't been
playing since AAugust of 2002 ... has anyone seen anything different since
then?
