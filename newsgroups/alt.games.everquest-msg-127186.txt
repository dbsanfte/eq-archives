Chorus of clarity is not a buff, its a pulse song, like Brusco's Boastful
Bellow,
it does its "damage" every tic when sung and only when sung.  This means
its not a good song to twist particularly, but this doesn't mean its
worthless...
first its more mana per tic than the sub-55 Icon mana songs, and second
(and most important) MORE THAN ONE BARD CAN DO THIS AT ONCE

If it was icon based, only one bard could run it in a group, as the other bards
would either bounce off or overwrite the icon already up from the first one.

If your casters were screaming, perhaps its because they were seeing only
7 mana every 3 or 4 tics, while you could have been twisting Cantata of
Soothing ( an icon song ) continuously for a mere 5 per tic... but thats
15 per three tics instead of the 7 you are currently putting out.  You'd
also be doing a little HP regen and stamina regen at the same time.
