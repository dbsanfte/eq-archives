Of course, nothing in the Warrens rules stops *that.*  If an
item will drop to a level 20 player, he can sell that item to a
level 10 (or a level 60, for that matter.).   No-drop items are,
of course, something else, but you can't buy them anyway,
even without the Warrens rules in place.   There's nothing in
the Warrens rules that stops a player from farming the item
as long as he gets XP for it.
