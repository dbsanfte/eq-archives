I have had this since the original patch. No one seems to have a clue. I log
on and then select play - At the char select screen I get the mouse pointer
in the middle of the screen. I also get taskbar icons there also.  When I
select a char the program says you have been disconnected. When I try to
relog it says I have an active char and cant get back on. I can play Return
to Wolfenstein, Shogun and other state of the art games no problem
whatsoever - I did the recommended upgrades to machine not merely the
required upgrades. SO in every area I meet the spec!! I have tried 2 of the
latest drivers for my card with no difference. I would at this point start a
new char on a non upgraded server in order to play but I guess the comapany
is committed to SOL. Oh well - If any ideas send a tell. Thanks.
