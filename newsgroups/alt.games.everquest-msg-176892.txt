Yay! Almost exactly what I was looking for.  A few questions I don't see 
answered though - will anon/roleplayers still remain anon, or will this 
strip the anon off?  Seems like that might annoy a few 
porters/chanters/rezzers.  OTOH I see anon people /ooc that they're lfg 
quite often, so I wouldn't expect them to clue in that anon will work 
against them at that point.  (And why I see *warriors* anon, I'll never 
know.)

Okay, that was just one question.  And one comment: I can use ignore to 
filter out twits *and* blacklist guilds in group searches now!  Woo hoo!

This just means they REALLY need to up the /ignore and /friend limits 
though.  Still not sure why those are still in, considering all the info 
seems to be saved to an ooh-that's-too-big-for-my-itty-bitty-computer 
text file on my side. :p
