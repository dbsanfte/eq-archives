Unfortunately, the new group is already nerfed.  Some vandal sent a fake
creation message before it was discussed or refined, so it has no charter, a
pointless description line, and a lot of news servers won't carry it.

Unfortunately, it's going to make it hard to make a real group with that name,
when the time comes.
