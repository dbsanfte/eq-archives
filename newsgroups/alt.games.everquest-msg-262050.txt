I'm currently building my AAs up and my next purchase will either be MGB or 
Dire Charm.  I'm an enchanter in case you're wondering.  Each skill costs 9 
AAs to purchase so they take a while to get.  I am in a raiding guild and 
could really use the MGB as every once in a while i"m the only chanter there.  
Usually there are at least 2 other chanters though who do have MGB at the 
raids.  I hunt mostly in bot and pov and sometimes I 2 box with a beastlord in 
Nadox when I am exping.  I'm not elementally flagged yet so I think these are 
my best exp spots.  Reason I would want dire charm is to increase my kill rate 
in these zones which would in turn raise my AA exp rate.  Should I go for the 
Dire Charm so then I could start gaining the next 9 AAs for MGB quicker or go 
for the MGB now and continue on with Dire Charm at the same rate I'm currently 
going?
