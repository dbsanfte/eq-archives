Which would not prevent you from walking to the "return" pot and going
back.  The teleport in and out pads in the rest of norrath are also seperate
from each other (usually only by  a few yards, but certainly by a short
walk in Felwithe...)

If this feature was implemented druids and wizards would pretty much
be out of business, prior to Luclin many of my characters used firepot
regularly as transportation, and they had to wait for a boat into TD and
then swim across the entire zone to get to them.  If it was as simple as
walking into the nearest city to find the pot, I'd -never- hire a port to
any old world destination again.

On the other hand, looking at their implementation of Luclin, they seem
to want -less- access, more walking.
