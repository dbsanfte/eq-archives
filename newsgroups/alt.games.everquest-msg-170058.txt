}okay okay telling me to not use abbreviations was a valid point and it was
}taken. i dont do that anymore. so drop it.

It's okay, mate, we're just having a little incomprehensibility contest.  
I think the reverse, no spaces, no caps,pig latin may have your original 
posts beat there. :)

Doesn't help that we were already discussing people being deliberately 
incomprehensible in another thread before you showed up.  Expect at least 
one thread on dewdsp33k to be going on at any given time here. :)

}either you want one more member
}of this board that tries to help in the conversations here or not.

Of course we do.  Welcome!

}tell me now cause i wont frikkin bother to write here anymore if the sole  
}purpose of new posting peeps here for you is to make fun of them!

Ohh... Just wait until you get to flame your first unsuspecting newbie, I 
think you'll change your tune. :)

}i can just repeat: sorry i am german and my english isnt mother tongue.
}meaning i will make mistakes and typos. sry this is the first newsgroup i
}try to participate with and i made a starting mistake: i used abbreviated
}language which was only proper for in game use when there is no time to
}type.

And you've recognized it and moved on.  Good job!  Your medal will be 
arriving by fedex shortly.

Believe me, we'll soon be distracted thoroughly by making fun of each 
other and will have forgotten all about it.

(Bonus points will be awarded to the first person who spots my typo in 
this post.)
