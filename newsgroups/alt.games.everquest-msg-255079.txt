They should either drop 6... or not be as retardedly rare.
VP change is the only thing thats excited me in EQ in a <long> time (dunno
why..).. after making my wife and I's key (we already had the original
key).. I set about finishing my shamans, so we have a slower and can go exp
or something...

In Sebilis... the area it can spawn is small (reets+jugs, where else?), this
means its limited to just 1 group... 2 at the most.
My group consisted of monk, cleric, and 2boxed shaman.  We kept everything
dead from the "locked" door to traks lair before respawn, exp was
attrocious, and it was a fairly slow spawntime.  Not bad though..

This brings us onto HS... forgetting the annoyingness that is locked doors,
waiting for rare named with rare keys etc.. this zone made me despare.
Welcome back to the timesinks of old that nobody enjoyed, 8 hours of
slaughtering skeletons and golems for a stupid quest piece drop.  Remember
VP is a raid zone... exping in moderation, say 2 hours a day for 2 weeks to
regain sanity doesnt typically fit with a raiding schedule.. certainly not
mine.

I didn't do the chardok part yet... HS went a long way in killing my
enthusiasm with the same old long winded timesink bullshit questing.

The quests.. they are being completed fast, I didn't look into any of them..
as they are all below my level of gear, so I havent really read any of the
required items yet.  In one of my channels though I caught some chatter
about using the quested haste cloak from Zland... so while the quest in
theory can be completed by <1 group... in reality, the chances of catching
Zland up are next to nill. He has a life expectancy of about 5 minutes, on
most servers I know
