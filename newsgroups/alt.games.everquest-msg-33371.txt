Hehe. Had I first read it when I was in my mid-teens, I would have
been shocked. I was a real prude.

My mistake the first time I read it was to skim the 'technical' stuff,
such as the layout of the wheel, and such. I was totally confused at
several points.

Years wiser now. I'm still somewhat amazed at the "Looking Glass" feel
that the third book has. It's all internally consistent, but boggle,
it's pretty weird at times.

Still, loads of fun.
