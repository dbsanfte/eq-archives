>I quite agree with everything you said. For me the game ends at 50.

I hope you are wrong.  My level 45 wizard partner and my level 46 ranger find
plenty of blue mobs to kill and there are LOTS of areas we haven't even been in
yet - mainly because we are too low.
I hate to think that in 4 more levels we are SOL without a raid group....
