The gamma seems fine for me, I did have to adjust it once though.

The zone times are significantly longer now. I was zoning in about
5-10 seconds or so, now it takes as much as 30-60 seconds.

Had a hell of a problem with my clip plane. It was set to max but I
was getting minimum level. I jiggled it a bit and finally got it to
the maximum setting, but it still seems a little shorter than it was
before. I was able to see further before the patch. Now I get a lot
more of the fog. I used to never see any fog in the distance at all in
PoK, now I can see reasonably far, but the more distant things are a
little foggy.

Except in Unrest, I used to be able to see the building from the cave
when you come in the zone, but now I can't. It's all fogged out about
1/2 way to the door. A simelar distance to when I have my clip plane
set to minimum. I got my clip plane fixed in Dangor's Cauldron, so I
could see the Island from the Shore, but when I zoned into Unrest, I
still got minimum view distance.

Other than that, until I got my Clip Plane issue fixed in Dangor's
Cauldron, I couldn't target the Female Ogre, unles I was stading right
next to her. After the clip plane came unstuck, I could target just
fine.

I'm using an nVidia card.
