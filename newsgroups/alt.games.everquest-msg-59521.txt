They spawn with SOW on them now.  I've never dispelled them, I will do
it next time I'm there.  As a bard I am designated kiter if I'm not
pulling anyway.  Of course you would want to probably snare or
dispell, not really any need to do both.  I would also probably NOT be
using Selos, just because if you dispell them then a SoW potion gives
you enough of a speed boost, and frees up a song slot.

I would say that at least 50% of the time, and more likely 75% of the
time there are two of them.  They spawn at too high of a level to
charm, so you can only take one of them out at a time, which means you
have to dispell both and just trust that they never stop to re-SoW.
They also come with SoW on them during mid-raid spawn, I've spent
quite a bit of time there, generally in 4-8 hour chunks.

With the PoG/Quest BP it might work, except Selos drops when you do
cast, attack, or are attacked.  I'm not sure how the BP works, I've
had the bad news to miss 3 bard BPs in PoG, and we have had very few
plate BPs drop in ToV so far.  Hopefully I have it by the end of the
month though and test it out.  It still seems like this isn't going to
work, remember, these guys cast AND summon.  There is no effective way
to kite a mob that summons, and very few casters can be kited.  Not
only that, but since bards can't root, and I don't see fear being that
useful in this situation, our DoTs are doing 2/3 damage, still
1600hp/minute with a Drum of the Beast, but only about 1000hp/minute
with SSS, not exactly fast damage.

I haven't heard of a single one, but I'll post it on the bard boards
and see if I'm missing something.  Are you sure they don't have a
druid on a second account that they park on the POG spawn point?  I
can certainly see kiting most of the other mobs in the zone, in fact
if we have several other pullers and I need to kite my pull around for
a while, I will break out my DOTs and solo him down until the main
group is ready.  I just can't see how to deal with the POGs, unless
there is another raid there taking care of them.
