Because Verant gets an orgasmic rush from the power trip
of banning people?

It's as good an explanation as any (since the other explanations
aren't much good either), *and* it neatly explains some of
their other behavior as well.

So don't restore any more stripped accounts, problem solved.
Why ban them also?  (That is, why ban them when you can't
separate the scammers from the true victims?  I have no
problem with banning scammers, but the difficulty is
identifying them.)

So someone trying to buy an account on eBay gets screwed, when
they weren't supposed to be buying accounts in the first place.
Like I care about what happens to an eBay purchaser.  Again,
why ban the account?

Ironically, if anything, Verant should *prefer* to let this
happen, as a cautionary tale -- once enough people get screwed
out of their eBay purchases this way and word gets around,
just how many further eBay sales do you think would be
consummated?


> In the "strip" case, it's just an a-hole would be duper.

So why ban?  If you simply refuse to restore, the problem
takes care of itself, and the would-be duper gains nada.

Why ban, when it will doubtless totally screw a lot
of *legitimate* players who were already partially screwed
by bugs, accidents, or hacks?

Nope, the blame is still on Verant, for thinking that the
only (or even best) solution to the problems you mention is
to "ban 'em, ban 'em ALL, mwuahahahahahaha!!!!!"
