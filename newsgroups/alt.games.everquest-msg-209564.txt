i agree with this, until the higher levels of the game -- i completely see
no problem with throwing my level 20 toon in a group with a beastlord
wearing leather or hell, even around 30, a warrior wearing banded is fine
...some people presume what i'm about to say about high end is true for all
levels, and that presumption iis sickeningly arrogant and annoying -- but
for higher levels, anywhere from 45-55 depending on class, people DO owe it
to their group to be outfitted as least as well as possible by their own
means

that means, sadly, if you need to do five hours of farming to upgrade those
crustacean legs because you're a 58 warrior, you better do that

if you're a 50 wizard with 140 int, you better fix that...port around, do
something

people can very easily be dependent "welfare" players in this game, and
toward the end, that's intolerable

soapboxing,
