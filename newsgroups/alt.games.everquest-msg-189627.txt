This would be fair if Warriors got snare, heals, fear, DoT's, and a
pet.  Or at least be able to solo reasonably well into their 50's.

Warriors do one thing well, and that's get beat on, and it's difficult
for them to do that when they can't hold aggro because they have no
spells like SK's, Paladins, and Rangers, and they don't have the
damage output that Monks, Rogues, and Rangers do.

I understand that Paladins and SK's were feeling a bit left out as
tanks, but it's gotten to the point that I have been in planes groups
that REFUSED warriors as tanks because they simply can't get aggro
fast enough.

Removing, or at least drastically reducing the chance for failure on
taunt seems like a pretty good way to even things out.  Hell, make it
an AA ability or discipline to hold it off a couple of extra levels
even.
