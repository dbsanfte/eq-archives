I think it's the higher fees that may be keeping some of the morons DT was
referring to out of the game (not implying anything there, Biz).

I beta-ed CoH, and it was a lot of fun.  I'd have carried on with it had
they resolved the ATI card issues.  It played just fine on the desktop with
the NVidia card, but all I saw was black sketch outlines on the laptop.
Since I prefer to play on the laptop (more horsepower, plus I can game in
bed while the missus watches the chick flick du jour), I didn't play past
beta.  My copy is still sitting at EB ... I guess I really should call them
and release it.
