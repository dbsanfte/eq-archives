I noticed there seemed to be no market for the items produced at low level
eg lumber. I checked out the price on the market and it was lower than just
selling to the vendor. I am not sure if there's a low level item an artisan
can produce at profit on my server anyway (Antonia Bayle). Maybe when you
can make backpacks or weapons it changes around?

So many different items are found that i've found storing them nigh
impossible and have just been destroying anything outside a few stacks.You
can't seem to drop them in your house like in swg or put them in crates, and
the bank-space without backpacks is pretty tiny. Maybe when i get high level
crafting will be useful but so far it just seems like a money sink.

I remember them saying that crafting would be like combat; very involved and
it wouldn't be possible to have someone macroing their way through it. That
said, I've seen a lot of people afk in front of the machinery, with a healer
(afk) healing them. I assume they are using a second class and some sort of
macro program to brute force their way through the crafting xp?

Eski the 11 Brawler,
going back for another bash on antonia bayle
