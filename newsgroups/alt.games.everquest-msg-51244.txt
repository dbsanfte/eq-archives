Very nice, but you know that Divine Ressurection is going to have a

Wow another fixed duration charm (Dictate 2) which will undoubtedly be
nerfed to not work on the same things Dictate did. And more clarity
spells woohooo what fun. What's the point of having full mana if
everyone is speeded with a Shissar snake, if nothing is messable or
stunable? Oh yeah so I can sit on my ass and cast clarity 2 on
everyone. Woohoo thems the fun times.
