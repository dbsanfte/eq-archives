Hm,I dont know,they always told us a lot of things which were flat out
wrong,and I still find not much spiderling silk in spiderlings in The
Feerot,but always some stuff for the newbie armour quest.
And there is still the problem with mobs under the surface,spiderlings
in EK and rock spiderlings in BB are still below the surface quite
often.
So all in all spiderLING silks are still harder to come by than spider
silk,and Bazaar prices reflect this.
