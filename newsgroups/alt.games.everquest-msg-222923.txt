Basic XP formula for mobs is something like (MobLevel * MobLevel * ZEM),
where ZEM is those numbers.  The basic result gets modified depending on
mob level relative to player level when awarded (ignoring group XP split
and bonus here).  There's a cap on the max award (IIRC the best XP is
for mob level = player level + 2, so red cons give no more XP than high
yellows), a reduction if the mob is light blue, or reduction to zero if
is green, an increase if the player is over L50 and the mob is "close"
to the players level (-4 to +2, or something like that), ... I think
that's all of them.

Oh, so the advantage of knowing those numbers is that if you know that
in zone X the XEM is 75 and in zone Y the ZEM is 100 you'll be able to
get 33% more XP in zone Y for kiling the same level mob.  So if mobs
are equally plentiful and killable zone Y lets you gain XP faster over
time than zone X (but if there're 6 bazillion players competing for
spawns in zone Y you might well be able to gain XP faster in zone X).
