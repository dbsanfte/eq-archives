>> Can anyone tell what are --> skill points <-- <<

Every time you level, you receive 5 skill points. You go back to your guild,
and find a guildmaster. When you right click on the guildmaster, a screen
will pop up allowing you to "train". If you scroll down the left side,
you'll see a list of all the skills you can train in. If a number is listed,
that's the level you have to be in order to train that skill. If the skill
says "no charge" (I think thats the phrase), or has a pic of coins, just
click that box and push the train button. You will receive a message saying
something like "your level in [skill] has increased."

>> and how they can be use to help in a trade like smithing <<

The smithing skill is trainable, but only to level 20. Meaning, you can only
put 20 skill points into the skill, and then you will be told to "train in
the field". But this is a good start, as the training will cost less to get
to that point than the actual smithing will. BTW, prepare to be broke. A
lot.

Also, tell us your race/class. Myself and the other people who read this NG
that could point you in the right direction. We can be helpful at times. :)

>> Thanks <<
You're welcome.
