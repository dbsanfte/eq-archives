The article read thus: if I hit something without haste, I will hit it a
certain number of times.  If I hit something with a haste modifier on, the
chances of missing are less (the damage per hit is lifted), so I will hit it
more often.  However, in EQ's mind, I am swinging no faster than without
haste; what's changed is the number of times I hit with each swing (because
damage per swing is increased).

If people are claiming that their logs are showing more swings in a given
period, then that would be contrary to the article.  Who here has analyzed
their logs showing more swings in a given period using a haste modifier?
Not hits in a given periods, hits-and-misses...total number of swings in a
given period.

Take this with a grain of salt because I can't find a link to refer to, the
article basically said that any haste item with a modifier of, say, 20%
would NOT increase your speed by 20%, but INSTEAD would increase your
overall damage output by 20%.

It's not quite as simple as that internally, but that's supposed to be the
end result.
