God led me to this verse last night which I have never seen or read =
before and it was the first time I knew for sure that I was who I said I =
was, perhaps you will realize it as well.=20

Isa.30
[1] Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take counsel, =
but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, =
that they may add sin to sin:

[2] That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to =
strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the =
shadow of Egypt!

[3] Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust =
in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.

[4] For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes.

[5] They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them, nor be =
an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.

This is directly referring to Christians.

[6] The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and =
anguish, from whence come the young and old lion, the viper and fiery =
flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young =
asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people that =
shall not profit them.

I think the young and old lion may be the Jesus of old and the Jesus of =
new, the viper is the Satan of old in the garden of Eden, the serpent is =
the Satan of today and is a dragon. Incidentally there are a bunch of =
dragons made of various materials to be found in this house that I am =
currently living in.=20

[7] For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore =
have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit still.

[8] Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that =
it may be for the time to come for ever and ever:

[9] That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will =
not hear the law of the LORD:

[10] Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not =
unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits:

[11] Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy =
One of Israel to cease from before us.

[12] Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise =
this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon:

[13] Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, =
swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an =
instant.

[14] And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel that =
is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be =
found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to =
take water withal out of the pit.

[15] For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In returning =
and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your =
strength: and ye would not.

[16] But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye =
flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue =
you be swift.

[17] One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five =
shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, =
and as an ensign on an hill.

[18] And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto you, =
and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for =
the LORD is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him.

[19] For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt weep no =
more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when =
he shall hear it, he will answer thee.

[20] And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water =
of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any =
more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers:

[21] And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the =
way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to =
the left.

[22] Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver, =
and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away =
as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence.

[23] Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the =
ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be =
fat and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures.

[24] The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat =
clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the =
fan.

[25] And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high =
hill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, =
when the towers fall.

[26] Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, =
and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, =
in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people, and =
healeth the stroke of their wound.

[27] Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning with his =
anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of =
indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:

[28] And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst =
of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and there =
shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to err.

[29] Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is =
kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come into =
the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel.

[30] And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall =
shew the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his anger, =
and with the flame of a devouring fire, with scattering, and tempest, =
and hailstones.

[31] For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten =
down, which smote with a rod.

[32] And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which the =
LORD shall lay upon him, it shall be with tabrets and harps: and in =
battles of shaking will he fight with it.

[33] For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared; he =
hath made it deep and large: the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the =
breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.
