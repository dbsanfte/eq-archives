HI all. Im going to be picking up my new computer today and will start
playing EQ tonight :) WOOT WOOT

Ive decided to play a DE cleric but am concerned about his faction
standings in the "Good" cities.  I want to be able to travel to any
city or area as Im very interesting in exploring the whole world.  

Ive heard I can raise it by doing certain quests but I cant find any
info on who has them.  If anyone can give me a brief rundown on how
this faction system works and what I can specificly do to raise it Id
appreciate it.
