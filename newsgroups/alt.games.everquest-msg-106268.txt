}Thing is, you could easily make your tests consistent and eliminate or
}"prove" my "levels > all" contention.  But you choose not to.  I know what
}that tells me.

Of course, you aren't going out of your way to prove your assertion that 
'levels > all', either.  All the evidence you have cited is anecdotal.  On 
the other hand, the original poster has supplied hard figures that -do- 
establish his original point, whether you like it or not.  His original 
point, as I understand it, is that it is possible to have two different 
characters such that one has a much higher AC 'stat' than the other, and 
that the higher AC one performs worse in combat.  For the purposes of 
proving this point, it really doesn't matter -what- he varies in order to 
achieve the difference in the AC 'stat'.  Trust me.  I'm a scientist.

Now if he wants to prove something more about the relations between armor, 
defense skill, and combat effectiveness, he will have to hold level 
constant.  And if we show him some gratitude for his hard work, he may go 
fetch us more data.  We can all interpret it however we will, but 
personally, I favor more data.

What we really need here, of course, is a character who's level 4 and has 
defense skill 0,  and a way to keep it from going up during testing.

The first part's easy, just get some deathfist belts.  Anyone wanna try 
it?
