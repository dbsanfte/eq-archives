Either way you'd need a GM staff, but I agree, the GMs shouldnt have to
handle all the bugged stuff. The problem is, EQ is very very old, with
hundreds of patches, add-ons, and whatever smashed into the code. It wasnt
so great to start with, when you add so much stuff on to an unstable base,
strange things happen.

Lots of ways. I dont have specific examples because I havent seen their
code, but when you have so many items on so many characters, with so many
ways to manipulate the items (trade/change
slots/bank/drop/sell/buy/whatever), weird things will happen sometimes that
wouldnt be immediately noticed.

These go back to "EQ is very very old". First off, their collision detection
routine isnt so great. I'd guess that EQ only uses a few points to check to
see if you're hitting things, while most newer things use "bounding boxes".
Thats why you can stand by a wall and be half inside it. If they used
bounding boxes, they'd have to check to be sure the whole box isnt
colliding, instead of the few points. They probably did it that way to save
CPU time - remember that EQ used to run on 300Mhz processors. So thats how
you can fall through things.

Next, their map format wasnt made with "invalid space" in mind. So, EQ has
no idea if you're below the world or in a wall, the maps dont differentiate.
Usually if you are completely below the map, it does pop you back up the the
safe point - which can make for nice shortcuts if you know where the holes
in the world are. But beyond that, theres no way for the client to know if
you're where you shouldnt be.

So, you've got your maps which are basically only a "polygon soup", a list
of polygons, and not much beyond that. You've got the lack of real bounding
box collision - you probably have a point sliding along the ground, a point
on your head so you cant climb up through ceilings, and a point in your
midsection no other point can get within a certain radius - so you dont pass
right through other players. Combine the two, and you've got a potential to
slip through cracks. Add in that the client can only check if these points
are sliding along the ground or whatever, and you get trouble if you're in
invalid space. All of which probably cant really be fixed, without a
complete engine overhaul. But thats not going to happen, you'd probably have
to redownload every zone in the game...

Wow, that was a long rambling post about nothing... Ignore me, I think about
this crap too much. :)
