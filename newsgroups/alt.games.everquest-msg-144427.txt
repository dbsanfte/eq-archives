Right. Because web developers have an infinite amount of time for each
project and never have another project waiting in the wings as they
finish their current one.

Cross-browser compatability takes a shitload of time and is one of the
most labor-intensive, low-reward, low-satisfaction aspects of web
design and development. Netscape and Microsoft both shot themselves in
the foot when they refused to support the standards set up by the ISO
and W3C. Of course, Netscape realized too late that it was the
proverbial one-legged man in that contest and Microsoft still had
plenty of tentacles with which to kick their ass.

No amount of lobbying on AOL/TW's part will repeal the law of
diminishing returns. It's too much time for too little of the market.
The sort of people who are holding on to Nutscrape as their browser at
this point are not exactly the most desireable customers anyway. By
and large, they're the same people who spend all of their time
screaming VERANT SUX in ooc--people who never fail to bite the hand
that feeds them.

Feel free to hold on to Netscape for as long as you want. Hell, switch
to Opera or Mosaic if you prefer. Cry to heaven every time some
website you want to use doesn't support it. But, don't be surprised if
no one is listening.
