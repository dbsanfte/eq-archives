i think i can actually answer this question.  i just started playing the
game maybe 6 months ago or so (probably a little more) and i was a caster.
it took me a long time to find out what classes were good for what (i
actually did know some about rogues, cuz i met another newb who was a rogue
at level 10 or so and he's been on my friends list ever since).  until about
level 25 or 30, everything that was wearing armor was a tank to me.  if it
wasn't in a robe, it could take damage.  i even asked a cleric once if he
could help me out once by being a sort of meat shield for me and my friend.
of course, by then i DID know that clerics weren't tanks, but since he was
wearing plate armor and carrying a weapon and shield i thought he was like a
warrior or something.

anyways, i've noticed a shortage of rogues.  i can only remember about 4
rogues that i have ever grouped with, so if i had not met my friend at a
lower level and learned about the class, then when a rogued joined my group
i would have seen armor and weapons and i'd probably ask him to tank.  so i
think it's those 2 things, the "anything that's not wearing a robe is a
tank" theory, and because there are not enough rogues for people to learn
about thier abilities and what thier job should be in a group situation.

just some observations from a relatively new character.
