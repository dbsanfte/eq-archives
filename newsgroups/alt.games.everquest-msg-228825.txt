Probably more often than you think.

In my case it was 2:30am and I was half asleep. I had just gained enough points
to buy the pet augment in Tak for 760 points, which is the "[something] Diamond
of Companionship." Right above it in the list is the "[something] [something]
[something] Diamond" which is a Guard 3 item that only goes on Time loot and
also costs 760 points. Guess which one I bought?

I petitioned and got a GM to respond. He said they were looking into
implementing this very NPC, so I kept the "wrong" item. I'll be turning it in
for a refund, but I'm going to test the process first by purchasing a very cheap
item and refunding it, just to make sure they got it right.
