Ok....... After two days and about 20 hours of AE kiting mass amount of mobs
including the 3 on Alla site no shard.  Please guys i need some help.  I
followed the area to the statue.  Clicked on it and moved a bit in  and
basically did 4 different areas.  The area by the 2 prisoners, the area by
the two cages with the 2 quest npcs and the large room very close to the
point where u enter from the statue.  Is this the right area?  Read its a
common drop but i killed sooooooooo many mobs and have no shard :(   Pls
someone give me some info on where you got yours.

Thanks
Lill
