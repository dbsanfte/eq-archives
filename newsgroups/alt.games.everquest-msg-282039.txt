"Next evolution" wouldn't be entirely incorrect, as long as you keep in 
mind just the sort of things evolution can involve and the degree to which 
it can have effect.

create a game that is different enough to attract players with different 
goals and interests. While there are certainly those who enjoyed both 
games, that I don't believe that to be the norm.
