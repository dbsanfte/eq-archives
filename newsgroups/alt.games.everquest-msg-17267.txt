You mean  there is nobody in WFP than can't see through invis ? I once met
with a high level necromancer friend in EFP and we went to WFP, so he can
bind me there. He was invis but when we got the Casters guild he said that
the 2 wizzies at the entrace will waste him :) I took it that the wizzies
there see through invisibility.

I have a question. I also have a level 7 necromancer that is hunting in
Nektulos and in EC. I know that the guards here will not kill me (unless I
bonk them in the head or something). How about the merchants in the Inn ? Am
I KOS to them ? If so, how can I improve faction with them enough to sell ?
Thanks
