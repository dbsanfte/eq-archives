Either way it doesn't matter.  The warrior or paladin isn't there 
because of how much damage they do - they're there to prevent other 
people in the group taking damage.

It's nice to do lots of damage, but the difference in % of total group 
damage output between a warrior and a paladin isn't worth worrying 
about.  Also since the paladin or SK is going to be casting during the 
fight, their DPS will naturally be a little lower.  But as I said, if 
you've got a warrior, paladin or SK because of their DPS, you should 
have brought someone else ;)
