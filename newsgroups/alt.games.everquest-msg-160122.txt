I'm not real sure... I think there were 2  of those little out of the way
bankers... there's a halfling in a room, there's the real bank, then I think
there was a gnome up some stairs somewhere.

I hit every merchant last night but I was tired (someone told me they saw
some item I was asking for in auct on a merchie... didn't find it. Even
checked the library vendors.)
Anyway the ogre can use any of them just fine. One note on your
smallmap.txt,  Kartis does have an enchanter trainer (I amused myself
getting his differing text by casting illusion high elf....)
