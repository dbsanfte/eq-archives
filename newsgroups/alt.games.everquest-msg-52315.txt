"Not taking into account any special levels or locations" means shamans
don't make the top 5.  Shamans don't really become good soloers until
mid-30s (you _can_ solo before then, as with any class, even rogue).  Bards
are even farther behind.  Bards can solo almost anything, but don't approach
the efficiency of the top solo classes unless they have perfect conditions. 
Which means bards might be considered to be in the top 5, but only in like
three zones.  Rangers don't make that list either, in spite of being able to
solo 1 to 60 efficiently.  They can only do it in a few certain zones.

Here's my solo list for 60 and well equipped (full list):

1. Necro
2/3. Shaman/druid
4/5. Monk/shadowknight
6. Wizard
7. Ranger
8. Enchanter
9. Bard
10. Magician
11. Cleric
12. Paladin
13. Warrior
14. Rogue

(See, I wasn't putting down shamans, they just didn't fit in that list.)
