There's absolutely no doubt in my mind I earn at least 2x your salary,
and more than likely, 3x.  I'm one of those "upper middle class" or
"lower upper class" people.

Wow, you ARE a complete moron, aren't you?  I'd ridicule you for your
lack of understanding of how American "tax brackets" work, but I'll
leave that for someone else to enjoy doing.

You don't account for the way tax brackets work.  If you're in the 28%
tax bracket, that doesn't mean you pay 28% in federal incomes taxes on
all your income, you complete and utter fool.

And you don't account for all the tax write-offs most tax payers take.
Have you ever even done the 1040EZ form yourself???  Do you know
ANYTHING about taxes at ALL?

I'm in the highest tax bracket, and don't even pay 30% of my income to
taxes, much less 50%.  Go back to listening to Rush Limbaugh, you
ignorant jackass.

Sorry, I'm snipping the rest of your post.  It's just not worth my
time to respond to someone as obviously unintelligent and uninformed
as you are.
