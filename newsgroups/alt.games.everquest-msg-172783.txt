Ah, so applying the magic word "epic" to a piece of loot somehow makes
it especially greedy to want it so you can sell/trade it for something
useful?  How is it more greedy to want that than an Emerald, or a few
pp, or a rusty shortsword?  How and why is the desire to possess an
"epic" weapon any less greedy than any other desire for loot?  I've
helped plenty of people get various epic bits, because they were friends
or guildmates, or just because that's what the group was doing or what
the group decided to do.  But barring the presumed cooperation of the
first case and the explicitly agreed cooperation of the second case why
the fuck should I defer to your desire for that item which sells for
20k (or whatever)?  If I sell it for 20k I am 20k richer, and if you
don't pay 20k to buy it from somebody else you are 20k richer, what
makes you more special than me?

Jekke was talking about pickup groups, just like the rest of us.  Any
guild that treats drops that upgrade a member (including quest drops)
as open random isn't worthy of the name (and probably won't be around
for long).  There's a helluva big difference between a guild group/raid
and a semi-random collection of strangers in a pickup group.  In a
guild you have recourse when somebody abuses an NBG policy (boot them
and they don't get the chance to repeat offend), and even so many guilds
severely limit loot for new members, requiring you to build a history
before you would have an opportunity to abuse an NBG policy.  There is
no such easy to apply penalty nor prior demonstration of merit in a
pickup group.

If you expect to get your epic via pickup groups you are going to
learn a whole new meaning to the word frustration.  And then, when
you quit the game in disgust... CIHYS?  :-p
