Amen. I think the intent of raid experience was to provide enough to
balance against the deaths incurred by some members of the raid during
it's course. As the hugest drawback of raiding previously was that the
ones doing most of the dying were rarely in the group getting the
experience I think they accomplished this quite well. About the only
drawback I've seen in raid experience is in the cases where the people
who formerly formed the kill steal groups now have no incentive to pay
attention during the clearing to the boss stage.
