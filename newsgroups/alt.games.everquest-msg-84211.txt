Judging by your system and the fact that mine does not have that
problem and actually runs quite well,
( p2 400 )
(tnt 16 meg agp)
(575 meg ram)
(cable modem)
(textures set to medium,etc)

I'd say its nothing wrong with your system so I'd have to ask:

1) did you leave the line "UseUmbra=FALSE"  if you had it in your
eqclient.ini? If you did having it gone now seems to be the best now
that umbra works very well for an nvidia card and a pentium proc, at
least it does for mine. So try removing that line or, as I did, just
change it to TRUE which probably does nothing but the important thing
is its not saying false. 

2) did you recently add some virus program which is running in the
background? Did you recently install new software which may have an
adware thing running in the background?

Under windows 98 in accessories and then system tools there is a
System Information too which has "system configuration utility " in it
under tools. Look in there to see what is starting up when you start
windows without you knowing it. I have all virus start up things off.

www.LavasoftUsa.com
has a nice adware finder/remover (careful for the false alarm of the
gator creature in anarchy online.. possibly other false alarms
depending on names of files)

3) are you in windows 98? If so you need a limitation on your vcache
size since you have 768 meg ram so that it does not get huge sucking
up lots of system ram in EQ which won't actually help you and may
eventually make you run out of memory addresses. With 575 mbytes of
ram I have mine set at:

[VCache]
MinFileCache=16384
MaxFileCache=32768

in system.ini in the windows folder. Mine might be a bit low but works
great for EQ. If you want a program that helps set up stuff well via
presets for what you do in windows 98, cacheman is nice:

www.outertech.com

4) do you have texture caching on? I find that it gets me to the char
select screen much faster and then I'm not graphically as lagged with
it either.

5) have you clicked on your harddisk in explorer lately then ran
scandisk on it lately? I don't know why but since playing EQ and AO
off and on recently I seem to have errors a lot. Have you defragged
lately? Hmm I just checked and last time I checked I was like 4.9
percent fraggmented but now am 7.9 percent (last defrag 55 days ago)

Have you tried having a perm swapfile no larger than what you'd need..
like say 600 meg or so? I have 575 meg of ram and cacheman shows me
that at my worst during EQ or whatever I was using 606 meg of swap of
a perm 700 meg swap file. Not sure why this session went that high but
usually its more like 485 max use.

6) try checking just one thing that might be the culprit at a time and
then getting back in EQ after changing it. For the windows stuff soft
reboot windows first to make the change. Most likely its something
which has changed about your system in the last few days if you were
fine before that.
