I have just one hint for starting in PoTorment. The first mobs you
encounter probably are some ravens. Nothing out of the ordinary except
these birds proc a ae silence. But it is either short ranged or targeted
ae. So just give the tank a bit room and keep your casters in the back
row.
As far as I know these first few ravens are the only ones you see there.
So just kill them and proceed. The other mobs there don't posess such
annoying procs.
