those two differences, in my opinion, are what make the Tboots *NOT* just as
good.
sorry, but for me, the biggest plus to jboots is that they CAN be cast on
the run. when you're a hp lacking wizard like me, soloing hard and fast
hitting mobs, that 1.5 seconds could be the difference between life and
death.
yes, I know we're not talking about wizards, we're talking about warriors,
but a warrior who is already low on hit points, and whose sow/tboots have
just worn off, that 1.5 second cast time could still be lethal.
