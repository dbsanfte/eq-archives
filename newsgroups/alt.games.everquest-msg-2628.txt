Cazels PR/DR is in the shitter..if you have the spell, they'll stick. And
not many people below high 40s/low 50s are going to be bothering with a
named giant who is there for an epic quest anyway. I don't think he even
carries normal sand giant coin loot.

Not talking about a shaman, but a necro...shamans have only a slim
possibility of soloing him (unless 60th, torpor rules), but necros can. And
fear kiting him will almost certainly eat up the full duration of plague.

Sicken is a crappy spell at level 5 (for shamans, don't know when necros
get it) when you first get it...it isn't like wine that improves with age.
You don't see wizards using shock of frost over ice comet.
