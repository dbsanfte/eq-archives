It was a mirror to your question for sarcastic reasons.

I don't fucking play one. If I don't play the class, its gimp. I'm
sorry if you took such a slur to heart, but i'm sure there are plenty
of gimp pallies that lament all day about gimp warriors. Its the way
these things work. Need I enlighten you to the wonders of the Gay
Bard? Nah.. i don't think I need to because don't think i'm not aware
of the level of the game you play at either.

That I don't fucking play one :P.

Well aware that Necro/SK's damage the mob and in turn generate a lot
of agro. But by that theory a wizard, necro, or mage can just come out
all guns blazing.. after all, they're just trying to maximize their
dps. And if the poor warrior, or even SK/Pally can't hold their agro
while the mob gets ripped from them wholesale, then they failed in
their duties as tank and the poor caster is sleeping face down. Part
of having the spells is the responsibility to manage the agro
generated by them. Wizards have dealt with that since day 1, as have
necros and most every other caster class.. suddenly you're going to
give a pass to an SK? I can't miracle up more agro than a Warrior
through procs, Taunt(new melee and normal), /shield, disarm, begging,
screaming for jesus, and whatever else the fuck they want to give us
can do. And for most classes and people playing them that is
sufficient. But if someone goes off the reservation casting wise they
should expect to die. Now, if a warrior has shit for weapons with 0
procs.. then yeah... he needs work.

Eh.. it depends on the particular pally or SK. At the same time there
is a whole nother dynamic between hybrids and warriors that can lead
to all sorts of tomfoolery.

...

You'll have to ask one. Granted, I'm not a shaman nor have I played
one so I won't go too deep into that. But a shaman that would pull off
me with straight slow would never pull off me when malo'ing first. You
may very well be correct in that it just means less resists and i'll
go with that for now.

Actually, that usually depends on AA. If there was one thing I never
can stand in an easy LDoN of mine, it is a glass caster. Pulls were
usually messy but fast so you had to be able to take a couple of hits
and if you dropped like a bag of bricks it sucked a left nut.

Paladin's love to show off their pulling abilities since they have
pacify.. you don't normally see one just run in a room and agro
everything. They like controlled pulling because they have the
facilities for it. I've had Time-equipped Paladins in group playing
the pacify/pull game. Granted though, some warriors stand like a
fucking tree in the middle of the room waiting for jesus to pull, its
really more a matter of player.

Depends on your level, how good your chanter and cleric is and their
level, and for how long. Quarm equipped groups solve a lot of issues,
but at that point the question is why aren't you doing hard?
