After a few weeks of play with my Enchanter I have discovered a few odd
facts and come up with a few questions.  I'm 37th level now.

First off, my CASTING skills always get level capped except 1 -- Evoke.  I
don't solo and I don't (usually) even bother loading a nuke or DOT spell.
My biggest goal is keeping buffs up on everyone.  I hate it when buffs fade
in fights and I am really good at keeping the buffs going.

My spell loads are:

Rune III (keeps me safe long enough to attempt that mez again plus I use it
if my tanks get to low on hp -- lagging healers are nasty problems for
tanks).

Buff (Clarity, GoM, Obscure, Ultravision, etc...  rotated as necessary to
keep group buffed).

Strip Enchantment (Takes damage shield and buffs off a critter -- up to 4 at
1 shot.  if resisted, repeat until they are gone).

Tash (lower MR)

Tepid Deeds (slow)

Memory Blur (hate list wipe -- I use this post mez and if caster or healer
gets aggro.  saved many a healer with this spell to date)

AoE Mez (for those "ADD!!!  ADD!!!, (repeat as needed <grin>)!" pulls.
Chain cast it.

Enthrall (Mez -- single target).  For the single Add situation.

As you can see no nukes or DOTs.  I have a lot of fun keeping my group fully
buffed and then debuff on critters.  As long as the casters keep going with
mana and the tanks keep moveing fast, my main job is to sit and make sure
things go smooth.

Of haste spells -- Augmentation is my favorite to use.  Alacrity sucks out
way to much mana, requires 3x the casts for 10% haste difference.  I have
many fighters request it but I do what I can to talk them out of it.

With 3 fighter types it costs me as follows:
Augmentation:  Half hour -- 90 mana cost -- 270 mana to buff fighters.
Alacrity:  10 minutes -- 115 mana cost -- 345 mana to buff fighters.

In a half hour mana use is 1035 Alacrity vs 270 Augmentation...  for 10%
haste gain with a loss of Agility buff (AC bonus on this) and Stamina
regen...

Now lets expand this to the entire party with Augmentation and only the
tanks --  I use 540 mana on the group vs 1035 on the tanks ONLY.  lets throw
in pets -- 2 of them...  720 vs 1035...

Using Augmentation I can keep a group fully buffed with relative ease.  WIth
Alacrity I bounce OOM quite a bit .  10% haste just doesn't strike me as
worth it in larger groups (my prefered group size -- 6).

I'll admit that I am not a tank but, Augmentation just strikes me as an
overall better spell than Alacrity.  It lasts longer and provides much
superior benefits to a fighter type.  It's low costs makes it cheap enough
to cast that I can buff the entire party with it and still not use as much
mana, in half an hour, as I would just doing 3 fighters in the group.

Now for my questions.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Am I an odd ball for doing this kind of cost benefit analysis with my
spells or do others do this too?

2)  I keep an array of buffs on the party:
     Obscure (I check if a cleric is in group -- usually 1 or 2 get it
anyway)
     Ultravision (helps even the night sighted see better)
     Gift of Magic -- GoM (On ALL caster and hybrids)
     Clarity (see above)
     Haste (Augmentation for everyone or only the fighters and pets get
Alacrity)
     Sympathetic Aura (cha buff on necros, bards and myself)

Is this to much?  (i.e. in most groups my other chars are in, enchanters
give clarity and haste out.  occasionally GoM).

3)  I load and use the new aggro buff spell at times (usually with a heavy
twinked rogue or monk in group) to buff aggro on main tank.  Anyone else use
this spell much?  It seems to help.  (at 39th level I get the aggro debuff
and I figure I'll use that on the "offensive individual" instead <grin>)

4)  I have a hot key for mez -- single target but I don't have one for AoE
mez.  Should I set one and, if so, what should it say?  Example:  mass mez
comming down -- pick 1 target at a time please! -- or what?

5)  If I use up a few jasper on casting rune spells on folks to keep them
alive through a mess, I tell them I am going to loot a few in a row to get
the plat back for the casting.  Is this "payback" logic unusual?

Thanks in advance for any comments.
