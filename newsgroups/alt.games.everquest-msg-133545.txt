I never have Gate up during an exp group, its only on the occaisional
raid where there's literally nothing useful I can mem in that last slot,
and I know I've ended up gating out before.  On the other hand, when
I hit DA or DB, memming gate is something I consider.  In an exp
group, camping out is rarely an option.  I'm bound right outside the
zone line, though, and if the choice is between fighting back to the
bodies naked or fully dressed and buffed... well sometimes I'll gate.
I assure you its a rare event, and I also assure you noone has ever
complained that I ran out on them; to Camp Out I have to start while
most people are still alive but to Gate I can wait till they are all dead
and there's nothing at all I can do for em but channel a rez so they
can die again.

Even so, gating from an exp group is an excedingly rare event, and
as I said before, from 1 to 55 I hardly ever gated out of anything, in
fact I'd have thought you were crazy to propose it as a useful strategy.

You clearly haven't done many named FFA mobs or epic quest mobs;
a lot of these guys are near a zone line or buried somewhere in
an otherwise green to everyone zone.  Heck, then there is TOV
ledge work, where I'm not KOS to any of the mobs on approach.
This is something that requires some evaluation of the situation, but
look again at my second paragraph there.  Given a raid where getting
back to the wipe spot is a relatively trivial affair, a gated cleric is
better than a dead cleric.

In fact even when its non-trivial, a gated cleric is usually better than
a dead cleric, after all, both are sitting at their bind spot and you
have the same difficulty getting them back to the wipe spot either
way... only the buffed and dressed cleric can be more helpful.  The
nice thing about the dead cleric, though, is that if -any- rezzer managed
to camp or FD then they can rez the dead cleric, who can then give
good rez to the rest of the wipe.  Also, in those difficult to reach
spots, all potential rezers should try camp/quit/FD in the hopes that at
least one succedes

There are many many raids,  at all levels, where getting back to the raid spot
would be a massive pain.  Agreed.  Never meant to suggest otherwise.  What
I'm saying is there are some raids, and many more of them in the high 50s,
where this isn't the case.  Much to my surprise.  Note again that from one to 55

I hardly ever ever even thought about gating, other than to tell people
discussing
various class "escape" strategies that Gate shouldn't be considered in that
class.
(Funny how a couple hundred points of channeling can make a difference there)

A) you don't gate on that kind of raid.  Maybe, maybe, if you are the last
man standing, but then there's really no way you are going to live long enough
to gate if that is the case.  Its no longer channeling, its sheer massive damage

over the 5 second cast time.
B) assuming a real total wipe, with no rez available in the spot? Same
way as anyone who died does.  You join the CR effort, or you get your
body SC'd.
C) if you were a jerk and gated out with a perfectly good rez successfully
camped out, then you wait for them to rez the mage and arrange a COTH.
Personally I'd think you'd wait till Lavastorm freezes over though before
I'd set up a COTH chain to get a gating cleric back under those
circumstances.

Yes indeed, I fully support the idea that most raids forbid gating out for the
cleric.
The planar ones more so than many others, now you are not able to get back
there under your own power at all.

Summoning to zone line is an option most raids, though.

I've never thought of your idea of getting the rez box up on a cleric
before I die, though, in the hopes that they can click yes after wipe.
Does that work?  Very interesting strategy.  Course you'd need
to set it up somehow, assure that they are in a spot where they
won't get aggro, maybe have the few still alive actively move the
mobs away from the safe spot as they die.  Rez box doesn't stay
up long enough for mobs to wander off on their own I don't think.
On the other hand, rez has a very long range, so I can deliberately
move off and cast it and then work as bait myself.

Still, there are situations where a cleric can see that he can't camp
out or quit out.  Just can't.  Raid almost all dead, mobs already
aggroed on you despite using DB and DA to clear it out... what
do you think is going to happen, you sit and the mobs just get
so unlucky that they can't get a single hit in in 30 seconds to stand
you back up?  Or that they can't kill you in the 'however long it
takes' time span of someone quitting out while aggroed?  Sometimes
you just can't camp out.  In those circumstances you have to think
whether your body being at the wipe spot is going to be best for
the team, or whether you, fully dressed and buffed but at your bind
spot, is going to be better.  Usually, its the body.  But there are raids
where its you alive at bind...

Note a down side I don't mention, probably LOM.  But then,
LOM fully dressed for me is similar to naked at FM, which is
about a bub and a half of mana once I get my stuff back.

TOV HOT ledge comes to mind as the principle example.  I never
ever try to camp there.  Camping is always chancy, gating a near
guaranteed success.  And since its a very short walk down a hall
full of ally to me mobs to get back to the ledge, it seems silly to
even consider camping out.  In this case, its not so much the Fully
Dressed part thats a big deal, as it is the buffs, lacking a clicky
stick in the guild, coming back with C3 and BAOR still up helps
a lot on rezing a couple dozen people.

Lets see, where else.  That big fire elemental in BW for the cleric
epic.  For some reason beyond my guessing, raids never seem
to fight him at the zone line where a botch would mean running
as many people as possible over the line to cut the down time
of rezing them all.

Named in UP pulled to near zone line (again, for some reason not
-to- the zone line...) and the damn things invariably summon me
on the rare occaision where I try to run for it.

Dragons in WW.  Yes, its a bit of a jog to get back to death spot
but its a fairly trivial jog, just have to keep eyes peeled for
burrowers and wolves.

I"m sure on reflection I can come up with more, these are just
some recent examples.  There have been other places I've gated
out of, and more where I've kicked myself afterwards for not
thinking to do so.  Is it the norm?  No, most times you go down
with the ship, trying to maybe manage enough healing to get the
target dead, or trying to camp out, or just dying like a man so
your body is there for easy rez to get you back.  But its a
strategy that shouldn't be ignored, to be used under the right
circumstances.

Hmm, biggest problem with the strategy is the faction hit you
take from the knee jerk crowd, people who haven't thought
things thru carefully will sometimes react badly to the gating
cleric on principle.  After all, at a very low level you learn
that gating cleric = bad cleric.  The fact that things like this
sometimes change at higher levels doesn't always sink in.
Heck, I hardly ever memmed DA at levels under 45, and yet
in the past half dozen levels I've never not had both DA
and DB memmed, unless I've just died, and then guess which
two spells I"m memming first?
