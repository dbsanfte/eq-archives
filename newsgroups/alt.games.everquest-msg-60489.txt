I have long thought that this is desperately needed as well... and have 
given some thought to doing it myself.  The one addition I'd really like 
to see to it, that makes it even -more- impossible, is how every 
combination of illusions and wolf form changes things... Just the basic 
bit, even, would be good though.  Although there are some bits that are 
damn near impossible.  Ie, how to test -starting factions- with the quest 
NPCs on the 2nd floor of hate...  Nobody else cares, I'm sure, but those 
buggers -have- to be good for something.

If there were some way to make it a community project, I'd be glad to put 
a few days into it though...  I really don't wanna write the database, but 
I really enjoy the level 1 character treks.  And if I could get a guild 
druid to help out, we might be able to get a bunch done in no time.

Better do it before I use that last slot for a beastmaster kitty, though.
