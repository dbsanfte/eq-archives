/agree
And so much for the backstory, of how the wizards, under Al Crap'Bor had
to move Heaven and Earth to come up with the magical power to bridge the
gap to the long hidden moon, etc. etc.  And how only something of that
huge magnitude could generate the energy to bridge it.

Oh yes.. and let's give those spells to the druids. Like they fucking
had anything to do with those spires or how to conquor interplanetary
travel. You want to give them the ones to go from place to place in the
outdoor areas of Luclin, fine and dandy. But what are druids doing
porting anyone across the vacuum of space, or to the Nexus in any way
shape for form? Yeah, that makes sense. *not*.

The only plus sides to this, from a simply greedy perspective, are first
that I don't *have* to keep my bind point in Shadowhaven anymore. I can
change it for raids and such, or for favorite hunting grounds that are a
PITA to get to. (e.g. Ocean of Tears, Tim Deep, or even the NE corner of
Skyfire if I know I'll be hunting there a while since the wizzy portin
is a PITA spot.) And second, both as a service to guildies and friends,
or as a way to suck more money out of the masses when I'm bored, I can
now use the previously useless Translocate Nexus spell which people will
be clamoring for in /ooc and offering fat cash if they are in too much
of a hurry to wait for a spire.
