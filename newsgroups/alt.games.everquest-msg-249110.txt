Yeah. I gathered that. You mentioned later in your post that the 
missions would get an extensive revamp.

The looting of which is suicide for many groups. Particularly at low 
levels when nobody can afford the spells to detect & disarm them. 
(Figure at 24th level you probably have a maximum of 8 adventure 
points...not even half of one spell...)

:) It would be cool... but keeping people on the edge of wiping out, and 
making losing even one character (the rezzer) an instant lose is pushing 
it too far. Forcing people to bring 2 rezzers is insane... there should 
never be that much requirement for particular classes. (Again at lower 
levels necros *can't* rez)

Harder maybe... but longer? 2 hours including grouping and loot 
splitting is a reasonable timeframe for a one group adventure.

Again... You want to do a dungeon crawl with respawn and no timer... go 
to sola, lguk, kael...  we already have that. All you've added is a 
'don't die' requirement... which is a given at the best of 
times...players hate dieing already, and in a group with no 
time-pressure their is no reason to die anyways since they can med up to 
full more or less at will...

I'm just not close-minded to the potential to improve things. Nothing 
will ever be perfect.

So Shadowknight, Shaman, Wizard, Mage, Enchanter, Warrior? Not a good 
group? Ok... I can accept that for particular encounter... but as a 
premise for an entire expansion? I think there's too much reliance on 
having one, (or *MORE*) rezzers in every group, given the fail 
conditions... especially if you make it challenging enough that people 
can die.

You do play EQ right? Lag happens...death happens.

The fail condition is too great, given that it can occur through no 
fault of the player. (In my experience I die primarily due to internet 
farts when in groups greater than 3 people.)
