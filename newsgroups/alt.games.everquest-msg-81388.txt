Actually, 36. They round down the result of level*2/3, it seems.

This is, in fact, something you can take advantage of on some
farming type encounters, bring along a level-appropriate friend
to help alleviate the boredom, and the exp he gets from it will
make him happy (Not to mention that he'll be even happier if
you roll for the loot ;)
