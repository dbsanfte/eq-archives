A scimitar is called a scimitar because it's a scimitar.  It's a
weapon from Arabia, and bears an Arabian name.

Druids in EQ can wield scimitars because Druids in D&D can wield
scimitars.  Druids in D&D can wield scimitars because they are
somewhat sickle-shaped, and therefore give Druids a *big* sickle with
which to hit things.  This is because the guys who originally made D&D
wanted to differentiate between Fighters, Clerics, and Druids.
Fighters got to use all the weapons.  Clerics were limited to
bludgeoning weapons "because they didn't draw blood", and Druids got
limited access to an edged weapon so that they were further away from
Clerics.  The fact that the edged weapon given to them came from
somewhere a couple of thousand miles away is of no moment.
