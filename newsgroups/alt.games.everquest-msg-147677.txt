Yeah, I thought so. You don't have any answer so you cry about being
sworn at. Hypocrite.

No, that's not all you said, hypocrite.

Now you're starting to learn. Yes, you are a jackass. The next step is
learn how to correct it.

Seems to me you couldn't answer one single point raised, hypocrite.
Know why you're being insulted? Because you are being a jackass to
other people. No one cares if you do it privately, but once you start
doing it to other people, well you reap what you sow, hypocrite.

To anyone with an IQ greater than an eggplant (thats everyone here but
you), its quite obvious where I say why you're a disgrace to humanity.
It's not hard to figure out why you can't find it, however. Hypocrite.

Insults show no such thing, hypocrite. And your question was answered
before I even needed to post, people just had to look at you make a
fool out of yourself.

And then, some are like you, that really are just trolls.

ROFL. Hey fuckwit, you swore at every person who disagreed with you.

I guess you got some growin up to do, son. Maybe someday....

If you had actually been here longer than it took to create your fake

*yawn* See above.

It's not hard, maybe beyond you, but not hard. Look further up in the
thread. See where you assumed everyone who disagreed with you didn't
care? That's all it took.

You lose again, troll.

Bullshit. You've never posted anywhere. Oh, I think you've been here.
But I think you're someone else too cowardly to post under their real
name.

Which is it? Coward, or troll?

No, just the fuckwits. That's you.

Trolling, fuckwit.

What you think, if you do at all, is irrelevant. Coward.


> But you have shown to me that

I've shown you what you are, and the happy thing is everyone here
knows it by now. Troll.

>
>So I , as well as the forum,  duly note.

I'm sure they do. I hope they do.

Are you still here? Haven't you been humiliated enough? You are less
relevant to EQ conversation than the crap I flush every morning now.
Please go away. You're not wanted. You have nothing to offer.

Goodbye, 'Larry'. Be talking to your real account someday, I'm sure.
