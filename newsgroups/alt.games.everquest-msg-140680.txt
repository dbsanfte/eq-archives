I read in one player guide where someone suggested a good way to get
your druid from 24 to 30 was by going to Qeynos Hills and slaying
Baobob and  Chandra Miller.  I did this once and they do give pretty
good exp, but moved on after once because of bad faction with Qeynos
guards, etc.    Is this a faction hit I should be concerned about or
don't care ?      Up to this point I've moved through Norrath fairly
freely because the only really bad faction I have is with bandits and
orcs.
