Not true Ben, actually.  Dungeons are not instanced, just quest encounters
and, say, fancy mobs.  Like if just Trakanon in Sebilis were
instanced.  So you have the social dungeon atmosphere until you get to the
"good stuff".  Then you can go off into your corner and have the mob to
your greedy little selves. :)
