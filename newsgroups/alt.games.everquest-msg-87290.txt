Quick question, why the AE slow?  I can see when you're fighting two, but 
you're a bard, even twinked you're light on AC.  If you keep it down to 
one, you'll be doing better.

Download Reed's Bard Song analysis spreadsheet.  Eqdiva has a link to it.  
Learn it, love it.  I have a copy on every computer I own, and refer to it 
at least twice a week.  It has all the info you need on the songs.  That 
being said, since you're meleeing, you want AC reduction a LOT more than 
MR reduction.  You don't want Brusco's though, it's only 18 damage, no DoT 
componant.  Use it for pulling only.

Charm kiting is still much more effecient.  Though it gets better at 38 
when you have two single-target DoTs to help kill your former pets.  The 
hard part about charm kiting is realizing that you WANT nasty, hard melee 
mobs.  The exact opposite of what you want when just melee soloing.

Learn to charm kite young bard.  If you're going to solo, might as well do 
it well.  You can actually be doing HGs in Rathe Mtns now, though I would 
suggest practicing on cyclops first.  By 38 you should be able to move 
onto swarm-kiting, which really gets interesting.  Specs in Oasis are 
perfect for that, though you might want to practice during off-hours, and 
the closer you are to S Ro zone, the less likely you are to kill folks at 
the docks if you have to zone.
