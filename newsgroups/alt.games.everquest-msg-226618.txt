Very good place to practice soloing on your enchie at around 50, ocean of
tears.  The seafury cyclopses are pretty easy to single pull, pull them to
the short.  My method is:

Make pet, haste pet.  go out, grab a clops with tash, run to short (sowed,
mind you), root when it gets almost too you, slow, walk JUST in range so it
swings at you and your pet engages.  DoT it, sit your ass down.  When pet
gets to about 40 percent, beserker strength it, making it invulnerable for a
little while.  You can throw a nuke in there if you need to, but your level
49 animation actually rocks, unlike all the rest.
