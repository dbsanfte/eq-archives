Not GM's fault?? I never said it was.  It is the fault of the company taking
the servers down for a patch.  And it should be the company's responsibility
to make right anything that goes wrong as a result of that action.  Why
should he not be restored when according to the rules he had plenty of time
left.  It was not his fault that the servers were brought down without
warning and he could not get back in.

And whats with this "twinking" thing??  Does it mean any time any one gives
anything to anyone.  He was NOT twinked.  Some of the things he was given
were from other players for helping them find things in Paineel and doing
things for them.
