I think Horizons still has some serious flaws to take care of.  The one that
irkitates me the most is the giant rubber band that seems to bind me to the
MoB I'm pulling.  Go up and whack on it, back off a ways and take your
finger off the key.... wait a second, all of the sudden I'm running towards
it again.  If I wanted to be over where the MoB is, I wouldn't have run all
the way over here.

The other problem is akin to what I saw in DAoC.  It's just not very social.
