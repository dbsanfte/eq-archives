Actually, it wasn't whining.. it was me laughing at the current situation.
It is fine for the company to make people have higher system requirements on
an expansion... that is a new thing.  It is completely messed up for them to
upgrade the current game out of the bounds of its origional users just
because an exansion exists.  The timing is perfect to.  The people who are
running the Windows 95 are the only ones who, if they do decide to upgrade,
do not have the option of going to the latest operating system Windows XP.
Realistically, verant should be looking at sending out complementary copies
of the Windows 98 upgrade edition to the older users.  Verant does not have
the right, even if it was unintentionally caused by an error in system
requirements, to tell people that they can no longer play a game they have
bought in good faith unless they spend a few hundred dollars on upgrades to
run it.
Dark Tyger, you need to get a life or look at what you are reading.
