I've read a lot of very good things about these bloodgills, but I'd assumed I'd
have to fight underwater.  Neither of us have, as yet, obtained a permanent
Enduring Breath item, nor do we have the spell, so I'd ruled it out.  Could a
lev'd character pull the bloodgills to shore without swimming? How would this
be accomplished? I also seem to remember people talking about higher levels
than us camping them. Can we handle them at our level? (say, 40 cleric, 44
warrior). We do know a 42 druid in my guild that we group with often.
