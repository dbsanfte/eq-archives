Well, it's a learning experience then.  Be glad you learned on rat 
whiskers and not something frighteningly valuable, like velious quest 
gems. :)

Allahazam's is good.  And it's very cheap.  That's the only one I'd bother

Nobody's laughing.  We all had to learn too.

There's some vague semblance of a reason why it's that way, having to do 
with the fact that no quest takes more than 4 items to complete, requiring 
that they have 4 slots, but some quests take 1-2 stackable items to 
complete, so if you put a stack in each slot, you could be completing that 
quest 40-80 times for one instance of giving.  Whether that made the 
server cough up a lung, or it was felt to be 'unbalancing' to complete a 
quest 40-80 times for that little clicking, I'm not sure.  But that has 
something to do with the 'why'.

It's still stupid, and they shoulda found another way to do it, like 
having the NPC return stacked items to you so you can try again.
