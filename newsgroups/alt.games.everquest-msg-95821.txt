They almost ALWAYS involve a trade-skill anomaly whereby you spend 20
hours frantically clicking combines on storebought items for a few gold
profit a time. Most of the real anomalies have since been patched (shark
meat etc.) anyway, so the 'guides' are probably out of date. The other
common 'guide' involves farming the hell out of rare spawns in underused
dungeons, and selling them for alleged prices that no-one in their right
mind would ever pay. SolA is the usual 'secret' farming area, and most
items you get there would be vendor fodder or require weeks sitting in
ECo to shift.

Put it this way, if one actually WORKED, you'd tell a couple of friends,
right? Everyone who bought the guide would tell their close friends and
save them the $20. And they would tell their friends. And suddenly
everyone would be rich.

To put it bluntly, if you do decide to buy one of these guides, send me
$50, and I will tell you a secret way to make $50 ***IN REAL CASH***
