To set the scene: I have been quadding bloodgills in LOIO.

The technique I use is not for the faint of heart. I buff myself with
Form of the Great Wolf, Skin Like Diamond, Spikecoat, Enduring Breath,
Superior Camo, Chloroplast and Levitate.

I go down to the temple and locate a pair of bloodgills.  Then I swim
over to a second pair, get to just inside spell range and cast Flame
Lick on the one furthest away from me. Then I swim like a bat out of
hell to the other pair and aggro them. I suface briefly to get a bit
of distance, then back underwater and swim like mad for the shore. My
swimming is 200 so I'm usually a tiny bit faster than they are.

Things get tricky on the shore. Ensnaring the bloodgills requires me
to take a certain amount of punishment. If I get too far away the
bloodgills head for home. I cast ensnare and grab the first one (the
one I'd targeted with flame lick) easily enough. For the rest, I hope
my channeling skill is up to snuff. Once they are ensnared, quadding
is a piece of cake. I have never gone below 2 bubbles of health doing
this, and chloroplast regenerates me as I'm quadding.

I gained my last yellow in 45 quadding bloodgills so I know the
technique pretty well. At 46 I decided to add a damage shield to the
buff list because I really didn't want to die on the last penalty
level.

The first quad goes great. The damage shield & spikecoat reflects 20
point a hit so I've got over 3 bubbles of health when I'm done. I med
up, heal, rebuff and go in again. This time, for the first time ever,
they stun me repeatedly before I can get out of the water. Still, I
make it to shore with 3 bubbles of health.

And things go to pieces. I try to ensnare the one I'd flamelicked.
Target out of range. What the hell? I retarget another and ensnare
him. I loop around for the next ensnare and BAM! I'm dead. First
soloing death in 15 levels. Oh, and I delevel to 45.

I check the final moments of my life. I discover that, in addition to
the bloodgills, I was also being attacked by pain and suffering.

I've heard of "pain and suffering" in LavaStorm and Eastern Wastes. In
EW there's an area near the bridge with a bunch of nameless, invisible
mobs (they show up on track as a series of blank lines). 

So where does "pain and suffering" spawn in LOIO? More importantly,
how can I avoid triggering them again? In my adventures around the
temple I don't recall seeing any nameless mobs on track.
