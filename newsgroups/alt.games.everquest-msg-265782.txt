Sorry, couldn't find answers to these questions on the EQ2 site (although, 
maybe I didn't look hard enough....)

(1) Is the availability date 11/8 or 11/9?  If I go to a retail store 
Monday, can I buy it?  Amazon seems to imply they will be shipping starting 
11/8....

(2) Any difference between CD and DVD versions, other than number of disks? 
Again, Amazon seems to have a "EverQuest 2 Pre-sell Bonus Disk" that is 
offered with the CD version, but not with the DVD

(3) Finally, is the Amazon "Pre-sell Bonus" the same as the "preorder 
starter kit" described on the web site's expanded FAQ?  Anyone have the 
preorder starter kit?  Is it still available?

Thanks for any clarifications!
