Ran into that in E. Commons last night and didn't think much of it at
the time. One guy had an auction hotkey selling tailored large
backpacks. Every time he hit it, he advertised selling them for 8 plat
rather than eighty. A couple people pointed it out in /ooc but he said
he'd typed it correctly. Not sure if this is a new bug or not, though.
Never really notices. Tells and such have always been screwey when it
comes to numbers and puncutation marks. Hence the famous "loc is neg 300
by pos 750" rather than just using "-" and "+".
