Wait till folks start getting 60.

Some will get bored and leave. It will be painful. Many will stay.

And one day, you'll wake up and have a bored group of 10-20 level 60's
to start putting raids around. Who have nothing better to do cause
they've XP'd to death in every damn zone under the sun.

Its amazing how quickly you go from being "gimp-guild" to CT and Sontalak
killers.... the moment you start in ToV regularly it all begins to fall
into place... you get an exponential power curve, people start coming more,
which gives incentive for the others to come (hmm, all my friends are there
chatting and goofing off, ok, maybe I *can* raid a lil...) and so on.

As long as you remember to have fun, that raids are still gaming and its not
the military that growth period of a guild can be really quite awe
inspiring... suddenly you realise you *can* do WTF you like ;) and thats
nice ;)

So, you'll never be *the* uber guild, or the *first* or even  the *tenth*
to things. But if your guild is stable and people have fun you'll get there ;)
