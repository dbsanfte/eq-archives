Oh sure, now that I finished up in Velks.

I got my 5th and 6th shawls this weekend, successful combines on the first
attempts at each.  Only failure on the way was combining 5 of the threads,
fortunately, I had 6 spare ones.  All this at tailoring 117.  I got damned
lucky.  Got a skillup to 118 on the 6th shawl combine too.  Now, I really
need to work that tailoring up, I've been dreading heady kiolas and mana
vials.  Then there is Fletching and Jewelcrafting to pay for.
