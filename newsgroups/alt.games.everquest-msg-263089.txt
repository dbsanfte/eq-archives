    At that level the shadowknight should have had the kind of agro lock you
DPS types can only dream about.

    But only if he's read his class boards and discovered the completely
realistic and stupid fact that he can achieve this using his otherwise
near-useless level 15 snare. The poor guy was probably using his other
pathetic dots...

    It sounds like he wasnt even using terror of darkness - even that (that
spell line is pretty much broken, but does work at lower levels) should have
held agro off you without serious effort.

    His darkness not landing shouldn't effect the agro it generates,
although I must admit I may be wrong there if another character has cast a
better snare on the mob. (I doubt it)

    I normally use a lower level snare to hold agro after snapping it with
my level 61 snare - the lower one obviously never lands but delivers the
agro nevertheless.

    I suppose technically you should have feigned, but he should have had
agro lock regardless of what you did.

James
