Oh grow up for chrissake.  More and more Martin, *you* come off as the type
of ass we need LESS of on the EQ servers.  I know I'd trade 1 of you for 5
pre-purchased chars with some maturity.  Did I call you an ass yet?

Come on now, you don't need to have devoted 20 hours a day to your
particular job to be awarded a seat in the 5 star hotels and restaurants do
you?  Of course not ya loon, money talks.  I bet some crack-dealing pimp
with a wallet full of 100's could get a table next to the hard working CEO
in that 5 star dontcha think?  Goddamn right.

Nope.  Pony up the money and buy yourself one too!  Heck, if you have *more*
money you could actually raise the bar!
