}[Thu Mar 20 17:06:44 2003] You just dropped your Summoned: Globe
}of Water.

You know, I noticed last time I did this that you don't have to actually 
drop the globes of water, they just stack up on your cursor.  I didn't 
test how many globes of water I could hold that way, but it didn't stop 
me from continuing to cast. :)

}[Thu Mar 20 17:07:00 2003] Insufficient Mana to cast this spell!

I trust you enlisted the aid of an enchanter for mana regen and extra wis.  
KEI is good, of course, but clarity and insight is probably more than 
enough.  But what -really- might make a difference is the oft-overlooked 
chanter buff, Intellectual Superiority, which makes you fizzle less...

}Learning Farsi would be more fun.

Heh, quite probably. :)
