There's definately something odd going on with pets.  I have 2
accounts that I play at the same time.  Tonight in Burning Woods, my
Enchanter's regular  pet started attacking the Druid on my second
account for no reason.  They weren't grouped at the time just standing
in approx. the same area.  I've played these 2 characters together for
about a year & tonight was the first time that something like this has
happened.
