Amen.  I dont twink, and IMHO using other character slots and mules to
store items is an extention of that.  When I had a bank full of 6 lot
bags I managed to fill them up with bone chips and pelts and batwings
for sale.  Then when I upgraded to 8 slot BP's OMG, that means I will
have 16 more slots!!!  Which quickly filled up.  Now my bank has 7 of
the Tailored Back Packs and a Deluxe Tailoring Kit and at one point I
had every slot ON ME and in the bank filled.  So I decided to take
some time and sell in EC, something I DONT hate doing, and take the
time to use up the trade skill items.  Great, managed to clear out 1
whole 10 slotter in the bank and pick up a total of 20 slots..... My
SoW dealer showed up and filled 10 of them=)  Then there was the East
Karana GM event and all that free silk=)  Bank refilled and down to 11
slots on me=)

Ask anyone who had rented a small storage shed at one of those big
storage places.  First you need to store your couch and a few
boxes..... then a chair and a bookshelf .... Then a bunch of this and
a bunch of that.... and the next thing you know you are trying to get
a discount because you want to rent 3 of the large spaces=)  And you
STILL dont see how much crap you have....... Until you decide to move
3000 miles to be with the woman of your dreams only to have her ask
you where you think you are going to put it...... So you decide to
rent an apartment rather than pay those greedy storage shed bastards
and life is great.  All the stuff you have is like a home away from
home and a great place to get away.

Until you find out that the maid you hired to keep the place up forgot
to change the bedlinen and rid the house of strange panties before the
Mrs. came over to put some stuff in "storage"...er  ...um..... what
were we talking about anyways?

OH YEAH, more storage simply means more stuff=)
