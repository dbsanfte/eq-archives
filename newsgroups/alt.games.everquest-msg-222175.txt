From a practical standpoint, yes, this is a problem.  However, in
my opinion, neither of us is in possession of a better moral
framework on the surface.  However, since I haven't killed any
teenagers recently, and I bet you haven't either, I'm more moral
than you are, because I'm living in my framework and you aren't!

OK, thats an oversimplification of your position, just to make a
point, its probable that your moral framework doesn't set you up
to do a bunch of random slayings despite feeling that its
justified in one case or another.  And my own framework doesn't
rule out killing in some instances, I was just using one that
-does- rule out all killing as an example.

Point I'm making is that in my opinion there is no absolute we
can refer to to define morals, and so if we want -some-
definition of the word morality, it seems to me that "follows the
rules he's set for himself" is as close as we are going to get. 
If you are the Pope and you say "Jesus Christ on a stick" when
you stub your toe, you are being immoral.  If you are a dirty low
down sonofabitch but you tip the whore who just gave you a good
time, then you are moral if you feel that there's nothing wrong
with prostitution but that service should be rewarded with a
gratuity.

I still can't make this connect with EQ though.
