With the problems logging onto my regular server, I created a
character on The Tribunal server, which actually had let me in, to
pass some time.

Problem, albeit irritating and also relatively minor (maybe):

Clicking on the Skills button does nothing. Cannot bring up skills
list to examine the current state of the character's skills.

- Used the same custom interface I used on my regular server.
- Tried to go back to default, in case the problem was in the custom
interface. (It did actually go back to default, though with the layout
I had made.)
- Tried reloading custom interface again (back and forth a couple
times).
- Used the Load Skin command available from the game interface
(initially used /loadskin xxxxxxxx 1).
- Custom interface still works on other characters on regular server.
- Created another character on The Tribunal but haven't brought
character on (would see if was one of a kind problem) yet.

Nothing worked. Skills list not accessible. Was even dropped off
server, when character died, and there was no difference when logged
on later.

Any suggestions related to the skills list (and maybe its related xml
file) and getting it to pop up when I click on "skill". Or is that a
"feature" of The Tribunal server in that you don't know the state of
your skills unless you go to a trainer<G>.

Any thoughts or advice would be welcome. I have NO experience with
editing XML files so that is kind of out. One thing I will try is to
reset the UI back to full default condition including layout.

Btw, in case it helps, I noticed that there was a "Face" button now.
The other buttons, AA, destroy, etc. seem to work okay.

Thanks in Advance.
