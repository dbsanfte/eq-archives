It is hoped that by getting people to enjoy eating the meat of American
Bison they will be able to encourage ranchers to raise this alternatice to
cattle, thereby bringing this near-extinct animal back. ted Turner has
invested money in this project and has dedicated some of his land to raising
Bison for human consumption. Thus, humans eating Bison would be good for the
animal as a species.

If we stop eating cows, what will happen to all those cows? We let them go
and eat wander mindlessly across our fields, thus eating the food that we
grow for ourselves as well as native plants? Or do we continue to feed them
but not take the meat, milk, or leather from them; a situation that would
turn cows into white elephants*? Most likely all the ranchers will just
shoot the cows they have left and bury em in a mass grave somewhere,
something that I'm not too sure could be seen as beneficial to the animals.

* In India, white elephants are traditionally considered sacred and can not
be used for labor. Thus, a ruler would give a rival a white elephant as
gift. The rival was required to pay for the care and feeding of the elephant
but was forbidden from using the animal in any way that would allow him to
regain what he spent on it.
