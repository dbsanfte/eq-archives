This is the building where you click on the hanging to go up a level in the
building?  If so, on the third level, I have purchased a number spells for
friends, and been told to begone, you are not of xxxxx class, by the
trainers.  Double checked at eqatlas, that is indeed the building.  My guess
is that you are not on the correct level.  From the ground level, click on
the hanging on the back wall, go around to the other side, click on the
hanging on the wall, you should, IIRC, be on the level with the spell
merchants and trainers.  To get down, click on the hanging again, I think
then you have to go click on a hanging one more time after that.  It's been
a while, so I am uncertain.
