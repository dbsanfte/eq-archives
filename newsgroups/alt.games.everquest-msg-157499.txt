Simple it is a frigin game. If you don't agree with the officers in a guild,
the guild should allow some leeway, personally if they don't then I assume
they are 12 year olds showing how they can boss people around.
Maybe being told what to do and when to do it in a game is something you
like, I get enough of that at work. I join a guild because they seem to want
to do the same things I do, if they are raiding and I can and want to go I
do (90+% of the time), but there are times I don't want to or don't have the
time to, if they don't want to live with that, then I leave, no need to kick
me out.
That being said, if I ever got help getting my epic from someone, I always
drop what I am doing and help them on an epic encounter.
But any guild that has no wiggle room, makes the game a job, and that is NOT
why I play.........................
