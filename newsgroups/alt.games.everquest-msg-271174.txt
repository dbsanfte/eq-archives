I doubt that an LDoN would teach a chanter anything. Most times groups
pull singles. Didn't you mention a group where the warrior was teaching
the enchanter how to lull that he could pull singles?

This enchanter will be dead meat in any Fearraid he partakes simply
because he never faced a serious train - and stopped it. Surely he will
die alot when he's lerning to mezz. But once he has aquired this skill
it can be awesome. This holds true for nearly any class. I often find
myself in groups thinking 'what could this group take on if everyone
would just know their class? :/'. I had high DPS groups in LDoN nearly
fail because we ran out of time! Just because everyone was afraid of
pulling more than a single mob.

Knowing your class and to an extend the capabilities of your group mates
classes makes for a real fun experience when tackling hard content.
There is a reason people fear pickup groups. And it's not only that you
don't know the personal playstyle of each other but that you don't know
whether the other can even play his class.

And I don't want to be the one to witness another player starting to
learn his char at lvl40+. As this normally results in stupid deaths
and/or extremely low risk adventures.

Also what's wrong with giving advice? He asked for buffs sure. But isn't
it more profitable to get some hints at how to play his class? It's not
that we want him banned or something. As I said above it's amazing what
a real group can take on. And you probably won't see it in time unless
you have a good grasp of what your group could do.
