Very much so. Seems to me like he took up an awful lot of his own time
for being in such a hurry, too. ><

Except in situations where a split second's worth of typing could mean
the difference between life or death, if the person can't be bothered
to take the time to at the very least spell out "please" properly, I
can't be bothered to take the time to cast SOW on them. As others have
said, "sow plz" gives the impression that the person thinks their time
is more valuable than yours.
