I've mostly solo'd my ranger up to 40 and it hasn't been terribly hard.  He 
doesn't have great gear, either.  Mostly ivy etched and a Treeweave tunic.  No 
haste items or fungi tunic.  I prefer to go after animals as they're fear 
kitable.  Ranger heals really suck, but it's gotta be worse for the poor 
warrior that only has bandages.  I've got a friend that has an iksar warrior 
whom has also pretty much solo'd up to 40.  Admittedly he regens faster than 
average, but that has to be an exercise in frustration - or patience, 
whatever.

My monk is only 23 so far and is a bit tougher to solo.  I've heard that 
higher level monks are more effective at soloing, i'll have to wait and see.
