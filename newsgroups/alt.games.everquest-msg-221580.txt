Well, fighting wise I like East Wastes or Great Divide / Crystal
Caverns

Sites that could help you a bit are eqatlas.com - they have a hunting
guide showing rough lvls of mobs in the zones, so you can gague that

Im really pleased to hear someone dumping a guild coz all they do is
PL.  Im in a guild who while we dont feel PL is unacceptible going for
hard PL constantly is, we do hand me downs, but, to be honest, most
people have to sell the majority of items as they need the cash to buy
the thing they wanted, but most get offered to guildies at much lower
cost, researchers and tradeskills are free providing you provide most
of the components etc, we are more a family than a bunch of XP
grinders, not to say we dont play hard though.. Sadly a number of
guidlies do leave tempted by the ubber hand outs and PL grinds from
other guilds, but, it is nice to see someone else who wants to play
their character not just get lvl 65..

Hats off to you, if you ever start on test.. let us know, our guild
would love to have you!
