Snare: about 3  Fear: about 2 DoT: 1

Snare and Fear, in my case, are both about two spell plataus below my 
current level. The DoT is the big mana burner, but that's OK as it is 
rarely resisted.

I find this combo works with a 16 druid. My only problem is finding two 
appropriate mobs in Oasis- sometimes it's a struggle to find a target, that 
place is so camped.
