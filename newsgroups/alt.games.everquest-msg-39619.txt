<shrug> What can I say?  By the time SoL comes out, I'll have at least
2 characters negatively affected by TCC.  But I'll also have twinks
who will, I'm hoping, benefit from it in that there will be more
people to group with in areas more interesting than bland outdoor
places like Omen and OT.  It simply doesn't bother me the way it does
you.

If it does bother you so much, I'm sorry.  You'll no doubt be missed.
