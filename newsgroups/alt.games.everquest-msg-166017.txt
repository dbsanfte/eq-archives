  I left all of 'em on after a brief experimentation with a few.
When my now-venerable machine started to chug in most areas, I 
turned off the new models and even switched to the low-res Vah Shir
ones. Now I still slow down in places, but it's not a slideshow any more.
  (I can't wait to upgrade this thing. Come on, January...)
