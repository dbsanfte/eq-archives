Bored with Spirocs, can't get a guild group for another 5 levels
or so, looking for a good fast fun solo spot, loot not important.

I -can- solo in POD, but it takes a long time to kill one mob via
chants, too long in terms of exp per hour.  The rats seem to be
immune to my lowbie charm, and I can't pull fewer than 4 flies
(when flies aren't taken)

I killed a few bats and drudges in ME, but again, it was time
consuming, and I hate fighting on a hill as a bard, a flat
pulling area would be much better.

Sanctus Seru entry mobs have wandering Optics that really are
irritating adds, cut thru the entry mob pets like a hot knife
thru butter, and summon when charm breaks or pet dies.  Been
killing the Dawnshroud SS guards but they have a pretty high HP
pool and the ditch out front makes it hard to kite smoothly, keep
getting "you can't see your target" messages intermittantly the
whole time.
