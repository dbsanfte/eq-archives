Black Alloy or Black Iron would be cheap, you won't be able to get the dog
collar effect as neck items are not visible.
I can't think of any robes that clerics can wear. Gnome skin is solid black
in collar but no short race can wear it :ï¿½/
Black plate, unless made by a smith there is really only Breast plates
available (Charred Guardian and enamel black)

Again,

To hold you staff upright move keep moving (turning) this will keep you your
weapon vertical (just keep turning slightly to look a the couple)
The items that appeared as open books are quite high end so thay may cost
you a bit, not sure of the name of the item(s) don't play any real casters.

If you want something humorous, how about getting a practicing smith to make
some kitchen wear, pots pans, cake tins etc.

Either that or someone with a high brewing skill to make some potent liquor.
