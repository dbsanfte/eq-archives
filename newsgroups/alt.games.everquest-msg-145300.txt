}Speaking of skills, alcohol tolerance is amusing.  It is a class skill for
}everyone except Clerics and the INT casters.  For them, it is a cross-class
}skill.  (For you non-D&D players, what that means is that the cap is lower
}per level, and you have to spend twice as many skill points for each
}improvement in the skill).  I suppose that makes sense: when you think "we
}need to send someone into that bar to drink that guy under the table to get
}him to talk", you usually don't think "send the priest!".

You just don't know the right priests!  Bergh would be my first choice. :)

}Mana recovery works like this: when resting, you recover per hour the sum of
}your relevant ability modifier and the number of skill ranks you have in the
}meditation skill.  If enganged in light activity (walking, riding), you
}recover that amount in two hours.  If engaged in heavy activity (combat,
}running, riding at a gallop), it takes 4 hours.

So, we can't, like, just stop the activity once a tick? :)

}1. Evacs are a lot more risky here.  Each party member has to roll a d20,
}and is left behind on a 1.  (Well, not each party member...each of the up to
}6 people that the caster has designated as targets of the spell).

Hmm, I wonder how those odds compare with real EQ... that's about one 
person left behind every 4 evacs. 

}Bards use 1 mana per round when playing songs (doesn't matter how many
}songs).  (This is in addition to any mana used by the few Bard songs that
}use mana).  So, Bards aren't as unlimited as they are in the online game.
}They'll need to rest like the casters.

Nerf! Nerf! :)
