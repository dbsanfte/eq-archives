Exactly, the stuff from stonebrunt was up on allakhazam's like the day

No matter what they say it comes down to being PR BS based on the very
few things a person camps which are green to them possibly stopping
someone else who comes along to stand in line from camping it. It
really has nothing to do with kill stealing since for the most part
other players are courteous and respectful about camps. This is a way

like the sheep that they are, will print it verbatim instead of
bothering to find out that it doesn't work that way and print that.
