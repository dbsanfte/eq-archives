Sure you do. And they have a right to say "this is our guild, if you
don't like it, move on."  /guildremove is a good solution if you don't
like the policy.  Putting the entire guild on ignore and pretending
you can't hear them is a damn good way to find yourself guildless with
a little word in the ears of other guildleaders who may be recruiting.
