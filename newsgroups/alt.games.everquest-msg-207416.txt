Of course, part of the reason many of those quests remain unsolved
is probably because they were broken for so long that people gave
up.

A classic example is the Sage quests in PoK - the combined efforts
of dozens of mages and wizards kept coming up against dead ends.
Then a patch would come along stating they'd fixed the quest - so
we'd dive in again, and come up agains MORE dead ends.  A while
later they'd say they fixed it *AGAIN*.  By this time many of us
had our entire bank space FILLED with research components from
previous efforts, and after yet another patch failed to allow us
to complete different phases of the quest - we got rid of all 
of the crap and stopped spending money on it.  Even so, after months
of work, by dozens of people, and MANY patches stating they had
fixed it - we found the last set of combines.  The end result of
all this effort and plat?  Items with 5charges of spells WE ALREADY
WERE ABLE TO CAST!

Why is it that folks are a bit cynical about quests in this game
do you think?

Grrr - that one STILL rankles
