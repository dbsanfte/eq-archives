For a melee I'd agree, as a shaman, I prefer canning and healing, it's 
much faster than binding, or at least was prior to the last patch.  I 
believe it still is.  For classes that don't have a decent alternate 
means of mana regeneration, I can see where bind wounds would come in 
handy, particularly now that you can sit while binding.
