Your reply to my rebuttal of your contradictions was not to further engage the
arguement, but to abandon the playing field.  I'm happy to leave my responses
as the last word on the matter, of course, but that left only your
unsubstantiated claim that I'm operating under a self induced delusion.

In many parts of PoP.  Point being, not in OTHER parts.  So the key would be
not to abandon the field, but to pick spots where this doesn't happen, no?  In
PoI and PoD such spots were readily available.  Remember the group I was with
consisted of low to mid 50s, after all, yard trash was all this group was up
to.  First couple pulls in a new spot, I literally did nothing, turned off
songs during the pull and stayed out of the way, just played mana during down
time.  Once we had the camp figured out, I started helping out, and there were
no additional adds noticable over an hour of working the spot.

This was a pickup group, actually, the only thing I had going for me was a
Legions of Valhalla guild tag, it wasn't till an hour after joining that
someone was asking about my main (clearly LOV member at 46 is an alt) and
realized I'd grouped with several of Their mains.  However, no, I'm under no
illusion that a 46 is going to get a lot of pickup groups in PoP.  In fact,
level 55 seem to have a hard time, its hard to get a group under 60.  As for
problems ensuing due to level, this is certainly something to look out for.
Careful selection of hunting areas and some observation should help find out
where those problems might lie, however.

Note that the topic of this thread, though, was looking for SOLO spot.  Why?
A) Because finding a group is highly unlikely.  B) Because I can't just solo
any old where in PoP at that level... due to the same sort of problems you
delinate!  PoJ looked like a dream, but I got insane adds, where my level 60
cleric got no adds at all.  PoD Flies looked like a doable camp, I know a
place with sufficient add free room to chant kite them in... but I was getting
three per pull where my level 60 cleric was able to pull singles.  PON... I
don't think so.  POI I haven't tried solo yet, it looks possible but the
kiting room would be the graveyard, and thats rude.

This is a more arguable position.  I'm used to groups of wildly varying
levels, perhaps you try to only group with people very close to your level.  I
think you are missing out on some of the joys of everquest by limiting
yourself in that way, however, if you are.  One thing I enjoy most in EQ is
figuring out how to get things done with different sets of tactical tools.
This means different groups of classes, different equipment sets... but
another factor that can change is the levels of characters involved.  Anything
that changes the playing field means excitement to me... perhaps to you it
means danger, or change, and is to be avoided on that basis.
