The difference is that you don't HAVE to trust the porter. If a person
can port they are not going to take your money then not port. I have
never heard of that happening once, ever. No one does that because
sometime they might need some spare change so they give someone a
port, word would get around pretty fast if they took money for a port
then did not port. 

The opposite is not true though, I've been burned by people wanting a
port at least twice who did not pay me afterwards. The simple fact is
that you and they KNOW that you can port them. You DON'T know that
they have the 50 plat they say they did for the port. Also so many
people play and do this that no one is going to remember their names. 

People would remember the name of a person of a level to port if they
took money and did not because it would be like the only time that
ever happened.

The other thing is who is doing the favor? The person porting is
ALWAYS doing the favor. 

So I always say this if they offer 50 plat for a port, after turning
off anon, "okay 50 plat please." If they say "no i pay after port"
then I say "goodbye." I only have had one person who did not beg me to
take the 50 plat then and I'm betting that one person did not have 50
plat. The porter is always the one doing the favor, usually at a
greater expense in time than your pocket change covers.
