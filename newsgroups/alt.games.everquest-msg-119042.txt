Yeah, and tizmak guard the port into GD, but I'm fucked every time I port in
because some jackass finished off Yaka once after he warped when I was
killing him, but while I was running to thurgadin (low mana, low health,
wasn't going down in after Yaka), I get the friendly "Your faction with
TizmakClan has gotten worse.  Con the next Tizmak I see.  Threatening.
Thanks asshat.

And yes, Tizmak will agro you when green, they suck for that.

I'm still apprehensive to Shik'nar, but I'm not concerned about faction with
them in FG, but in Mons Letalis, since I like to hunt there a bit and
they're just another wanderer that I'd rather not have add to combat (it's
royally annoying that they're social with Thought Leaches).  Yes, all
factional shik'nar are on the same faction, Paludal caverns, Mons Letalis,
FG at least.
