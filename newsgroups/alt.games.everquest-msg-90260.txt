Well I'm a 51 Druid. I've started a Luclin character or two, and ended up
zeroing them.  The BLs are cute but meaningless within the EQ characer
framework and the Shamans etc offer no unique capabilities taht would  prompt
me to try one on for size. There's no need for this humble Druid to go there so
screw it. That world is soo laggy it's like trying to wade through a New York
sewer.  

But I do agree with you on an objective basis. There's a definite anti-Druid
bias in the EQ development Gestapo.

Now had they created  new classes cuch as *Warlock* and *BattleMage* for thier
new *Moon* and had not crippled a Druid's usefulness, I might change my mind.

They have not. They probably will not, so I'm waiting for some of these MMetc
games to get out of Beta.

Meanwhile I'll level my Druid from time to time, use him as a mule and focus on
my new, very cute and highly toxic DE NEC. Next they'll start *balancing* that
class. Now to find my 51 NEC partner and clean tables.

It's a shame because it probably takes more thought and skill to level and play
these two classes .... well my 20  Monk might differ with me, and I understand
the Bard takes some intelligence to play well.
