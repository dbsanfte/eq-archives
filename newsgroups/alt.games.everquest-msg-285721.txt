Mob is level 71, doesn't hit very hard, uses the 8k nuke every 30 seconds
or so.  It's 8k + Feign Death, and the resist adjustment is -1000 so
infusion won't help much.  Range is 500 as well so no hiding.

My comment I guess wasn't the 'brute force' approach but more the 'tank him
with a tank that has more than 8k hitpoints'.  His melee DPS is low enough
that you'll be able to spot heal the 8k if you keep the tank pretty
healthy.

It's part of a long quest that reveals the lore in TSS and includes some
raid only drops, so it's not necessarily meant to be easy, or doable by
people who can't locate a 12k buffed tank.
