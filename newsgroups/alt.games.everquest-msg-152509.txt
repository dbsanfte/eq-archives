   Hmmm.  I'm pretty sure that cox is okay with me running a web site
from home.  I think they envision me running some sort of cutsey
personal webpage, rather than a being the webmaster for a fairly largish
guild.  I did speak to a rep when I was setting it up, and he knew I was
running it from my living room.  Just curious, why would running it from
home be a problem? 

Annie <--- Also told him it was "For my guild", but doesn't think that
he believed that part.
