Update on that: my "team" has grown from the small list I showed, to now
include another 65 cleric, 65 rogue, a 65 ranger or 2, another 65 chanter...
doze shouldn't be a problem :)  Were very ambitious though, and will be
setting our sights higher!

Got any info on him?  I havent exped in tactics all that much, and when I
asked my guild they said he was the trigger for banes (agro him and he
spawns waves of mobs).. it drops on these waves, or what?

3 groups and 3 hours is nuts, for a reward of that!  Unless im missing
something, the risk v reward seems very out of whack here

I tried to exp in PoV the other day.. I've pretty much avoided the zone
since I got hoh flagged...  anyway, the lag in PoV was SO bad.  Not to
mention the human guard I charmed also summoned, and when we were leaving he
started summoning random characters and smacking them down!

Good job he's nonkos, cuz he was hasted too and a right monster!

Assuming I get him his VT key.. were farming so much at present, things like
orb of evasion (100hp range, and a +dodge or parry or something mod) and
vengence 3 gloves are going FFA, ffa AoB sandals on the first blob, even a
lunar fungi went FFA...  so the reward is there if i can be arsed.

My shaman still isnt keyed.. I actually decided to take my rogue to ME, and
level him up while camping the shard at the weekend.. oh man, did I say
enough times how much I hate ME?

I've been kinda laggy lately, but I managed to run 5 chars to the "safe
spot", the lil dip on the right side looking out from akheva.

Wolf agrod, np.. kill.. second wolf agrod, np charm and kill the first.  I
was getting add after add though, I'd kill a mob and 2 more adds would agro
me, within 5 mins of being there I have like 8 mobs in the camp.. woah
lag... omfg my monk died.

Its all slowed, chanter has a charmed wolf pet, its recoverable..  damn this
lag is still bad, holy shit chanter dead too.  So my shaman decides to RUN
for it!  He makes his way to akheva, the lag meant he was still taking blows
for a few seconds even after running, 800hp, I kept to akheva steps (there
are mobs who guard it, and more further in).. smack..  nuke.. 200hp, dot on
me.. fuck it im dead too, I start jumping for dear life.. LOADING PLEASE
WAIT..  You have entered akheva.

Ok so it wasn't a total party wipeout, but it was a ridiculous outcome..
/rude ME.. /rude lag.. /rude ISP who cant send anybody out to fix my cable
modem till next week

When my monk got his ME shard, it involved camping there till 8.30am the
next day (playing nonstop thru the night).. I thought at least if my rogue
was getting exp on them, it wouldnt be a "camp", it would just be a "new pl
spot", right?  Only this time something that would pay off in the long run.

Maybe when I stop lagging out, and taking 5 attempts and 2 mins to load
Yahoo.com (go go 1mb cable) I'll try again... but until then, ME, blow me!

> Running 30k on Karana, count your blessings :P

It didnt occur to me that Cazic armour was REQUIRED level 51, not rec. level
xxx..  I was pretty annoyed that my rogue can't wear his new pants yet.  I
think I'll hold from buying a BP.. cuz that pisses me off, get a new toy and
can't use it!!! ^&*^%*
