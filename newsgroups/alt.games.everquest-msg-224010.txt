That's not the point.

It undermines the nature of a roleplaying game. When was the last time 
someone in a P&P game said to the GM... I need a new sword, and the GM 
said well you could either play the campaign I've set up and hope the 
dragon drops one... or pass me a fiver.

If it has to exist at all then it should be black market, not a 
sanctioned and approved way to play.
