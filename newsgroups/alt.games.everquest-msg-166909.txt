Very possibly. Depends what wizards are on. For the two that normally
are (me and a 56) I have my epic and am already sitting on another
Gnarled Staff to MQ. The 56 has hers already and just needs Fear. For
some odd reason, we are the only ones that ever seem to ask for VS, even
though he drops some great legs and a couple other nice items. Odd, I
know, but you go with what the crowd wants.

If I can talk them into it and get a CoTH group down to juggs fast
enough, I may consider that. But we've got competition from other low
tier guilds who've been trying to farm him for teeth, and we're not good
at racing.

We've never done Lord Bob yet. I suppose we should try some day.

> Velk, 

See Lord Bob, above. But when asked, the general thought still seems to
be that he'd smoke us. How does he rate compared to Trak?

> Vindi, 

We've still not taken him on five tries and kind of gave up. 

> Statue,

See Vindi

> Vaniki, 

Who?

> Zlandikar

Also under the impression that Zlandikar would take our lunch money and
make us cry. Isn't he pretty tough? I mean, he drops a sleeper's key
talisman, right? Though I'd love to make the run just to see if we could
get one of them ubah maces for our MA along the way.

Basically, we've been focusing on planes raids of late because there's
less competition and we've been on a kind of rabid frothing run of
trying to get epics for everyone who's past 55. And we still need a lot
of drops from Fear and Hate for folks.
