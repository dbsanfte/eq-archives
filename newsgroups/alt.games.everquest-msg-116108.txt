So do underhanded and illegal business practices.

In what way do the bad things other companies have done make the things
Microsoft has done any less wrong?

Microsoft has $40 Billion cash on hand, they didn't get it from being kind
and benevolent. A lesser evil is still just as evil.

Utter nonsense. Microsoft has done many, many things that are detrimental to
consumers, and they continue to do things like this.

Example: I signed up for Hotmail for an extra email account. I explicitly
opted out of everything. I get enough spam without Microsoft giving my email
address out to others. Well . . . . it turns out that Microsoft recently
opted-in everyone in their Hotmail system and started sharing their email
addresses.

Example: Microsoft has attempted to shut down LindowsOS.com claiming that it
is an infringement on their trademark of the term Windows. They're claiming
trademark on a completely generic term that has been used thousands of times
in various products.

Example: A Microsoft Corp. executive urged the company to quietly retaliate
against supporters of the rival Linux operating system in an August 2000
memo that nine states still suing the software giant want admitted as
evidence.

Example: A Microsoft executive told a federal judge today that the company
should be allowed to make changes in its Windows operating system that
impair the performance of other programs so long as the company believes it
is acting in the best interest of Windows users.


Example: MS Executive Linda Averett has admitted that Internet Explorer
trumps user preferences for audio playback, and explains away a failure of
IE6 searches to find RealAudio sites as a "mistake by the search team." My
personal favorite: an MS-internal email exchange where one employee suggests
that everyone "Remember the 'embrace and extend' campaigns we've used in the
past," and an MS executive admonishes that "We need to keep all of this off
the airwaves." See also related stories at Yahoo, CNN, and the NYT."


I have no problem with Bill Gates, I have a problem with Microsoft's
Anti-competitive tactics.
