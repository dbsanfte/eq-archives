Uh, I think you misunderstood a bit there... I often take breaks from
the game, sometimes MONTHS at a time, that's why my highest level is
still only 50, even though I've been playing since release. However, up
until now, the one thing that was there when I came back were my friends.
And many of those live in the US, or are euros who didn't want to do the
move. I won't be hanging out with them again, THAT's why I'm sad. All
that said, I've already created a new char on my old server, so I will
see them occasionally.

Sure, I knew this would happen when I /movelog yes'd, but the full
realization didn't hit me until I was standing in North Freeport,
surrounded by unknown people, kinda like the realization of a loved
one's death doesn't hit you until you're at their funeral. (Bad analogy,
I know, nobody has died here, but just trying to explain the feeling
here)
