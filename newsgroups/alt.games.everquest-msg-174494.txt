    Bypassing Grummus stops you further down the line. Someone with the
quest access to CoD can still get the key to lower CoD, for Bertox, but
doesn't get "credit" for Bertox when talking to the Grand Librarian about
the Codex. So you get stopped before entry to Sol Ro's Tower. Doing Grummus
later will get you fixed, but then you have to convince your guild to kill
the giant ball of lard one more time instead of going to all the nifty
places they can visit.
