All on my 33/34 druid.

Ran through Paludal to Hollowshade Moor, through Shar Vahl to Shadeweaver's
Thicket, ran back to where there were some blues on track, con one with
invis up, yes it's undead, indifferent, run through the camp, oops, here
come 3 skellies, run up to the lava filled "Unknown Zone"  line, get saved
by a level 48ish shaman, camo up again and run into the tunnel, see a bunch
of aliens and a fire elemental, all indiff w/ camo, drop camo, aliens are
indiff, camo up anyway again, run back to see the lava filled tunnel, fire
res buff and levitate, still take too much damage to get in, run out, get
aggroed by level 45 fire elemental "Jenhadar", who calls his otherwise
friendly buddies to blast me, "You have been incinerated for 580 points of
damage", loading please wait.

Other than that all of my deaths in the past month have been back in the old
world, like running out to the PoG tower in WL and buying my port spells,
and getting ganked by an under the world Teir'Dal Merc.
thanks 371 pt harm touch!
