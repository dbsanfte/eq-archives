I autojoined a channel and now I can't figure out how to stop auto-joining.
I can leave the channel, but that only works until I log in again and then
it autojoins again.  I've asked around and so far have not got a good
answer.

One said it's a toggle so just autojoin again
One said to /autojoin ,
One said to reset all my autojoin channels and leave that one out, except
that I have no other autojoin channels

Any ideas?
