Close, but not quite. :) The effect is based on level alone, not the
Alteration skill. :)

Theoretically possible, I suppose. Though using a potion really *shouldn't*
raise casting skills, if that's the case.

Using a sow potion before level 14 or so isn't of much use... maybe the
difference between running and JBoots. The effect is based off the caster's
(ie: person who drinks the potion) level, so if you're a level 5 and you
snarf a potion, you'll get the same effect as if a level 5 character could
cast sow. :)
