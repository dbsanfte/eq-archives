No we havent really done any quests, except our newbie armour quests, newbie
weapon quests and my trueshot longbow quest (with my elite fletching skill
of 84 :P now its 122 and stuck hehe).

Well, at least the mob you have to kill is in Highpass. You could

We havent been of our home continent much, a brief canoe ride to the aqua
goblin island in the Ocean of tears (followed by swiftly swimming back,
after our canoe grounded and we spotted a unique NPC who conned yellow to us
at about lvl 17), my trip to freeport, and a bit of leveling in the oasis of
mar/paludal caverns.  Thats about the extent of our travels so far (oh and
estate of unrest/dagnors).

I will go and look up this quest and see what my brother thinks later.

Thanks for the reply.
