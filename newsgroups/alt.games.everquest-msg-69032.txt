Play it, and play it regularly.   I run all models, but at medium
resolution (I don't see that big a difference in image quality, but a
difference in speed is noticable), with lighting on, animations off
(really never cared about them anyway).

Luclin is where this new engine shines... Sanctus Seru is totally
amazing, in texture, detail, and sheer beauty.   Dawnshroud Peaks is
also a beautifully rendered zone.  My only complaint, at least in the
beginning, was the domination of the zones by the (not so fondly
called) Uber Guilds, with their member roles limited to 59's and 60's,
all with epics.  Like they needed to be in a mid/low level zone.

And my system specs are nothing to brag about -

Duron 750
512mb ram
GeForce2 GTS Pro...

nice and middle of the road...
