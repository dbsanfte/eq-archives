As to the discussion about the nature of time, yes, it would be a red
herring, but the original debate was the application of Occam's Razor
to "The Universe always existed" vs "God always existed and then He
created the universe"

I intended to highlight that "The Universe always existed" was a
deceptively simple statement. "The Universe always existed" fails to
provide a reason for its initial state at the beginning of time. And
therefore it makes an unstated assumption about the initial state of
the universe. The idea being that giving  form to that unstated
assumption is to speculate and effectively bring the two statements
into equivalent complexity. In a way... God and the 'reason for
existence' are the same thing.

Yes. Yes. Yes. Any assumptions about the 'pre-history' of time are no
different than religion. That is my point exactly.

Hmm. You could certainly know something I don't on the subject. I have
never seen any scientific findings that assert a reason for the
initial state/origin/... of the universe had to be the way it was.
Some suggestions as to what its initial configuration was sure... but
a 'why' they were 'such' in the first place, no. At least not that
I've seen.

Right some theories explain the observed facts and can be used to make
verifiable predictions. Religious theories don't work well for
scientific predition. Is that fair? And all theories outside the
universe are equally 'religious' as they cannot be verified, tested,
experimented, etc (at least at this stage).

I agree. But belief in nothing is ... unsatisfactory. And current
science offers no theories (that I am aware of). That doesn't mean the
kooks are right... but it does make telling them they are wrong
fallacious. Occam's Razor is not infallible sometimes things actually
are complicated even if the facts could have been explained by
something simple.

Random chance vs. some reason. Science never starts out with random
chance as the theory to run with.

>It's not ultimately inexplicable.

Of course not. But the explanation might be that God created it that
way because he... :) Just kidding, at any rate its not explicable with
our existing science.

Related tangent... do you feel the HUP is adequately explained by
science? It seems to me a recognition that some information about the
universe is strictly unknowable.

On another  related note... if I was looking for 'outside forces to
reach into our universe'...the HUP is one place I'd consider looking.
The other place is the initial configuration.

I'm going to have to defer making an opinion. I haven't seen it this
evidence.

>The sun coming up every day was once a miracle.

And by definition it was... inexplicable by science. Naturally they
did eventually figure it out without appealing to Gods personally
dragging it around.

Worthy of consideration yes. Worthy of entertaining, no probably not.

And at risk of creating a true red herring... 

As I alluded above, my use of the word 'God' doesn't strictly require
religion...If you start with "God is the reason for creation" then
suppose we do find a scientific explanation for the reason for
creation. Perhaps then we finally find God in a very real form that we
can relate to (in terms we can describe with science). 

Yes this definition of God is playing with semantics, but its not
abusing them. Its certainly not the God portrayed in the Bible...
razing cities, fighting devils, and forgiving worshippers...but that's
a God I've never subscribed to anyways... 

And for all my attempts to defend the possibility of God here, that
really isn't the God I'm defending. I'm more likely to believe in a
powerful alien either outside the universe as creator, or manifest as
an 'intelligent' universe iteself.

If I'm to beleive in no gods at all that works too, but it leaves the
unanswered question ... why. I don't know that there *has* to be a
reason, but I'm not irrational for being open to the possibility that
there is one.
