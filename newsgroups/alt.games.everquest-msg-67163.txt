Increased?  Incredible, I was already progressing in AA points (at 50/50) as slowly
as I was in exp points, and I"m in a 54 hell level.  Are they suggesting that 2 more
points of wisdom (one of the possible results of that first AA point) should take
not only just as much exp as going from 54 to 55, but -more-?

The hybrid/warrior issue definately needed fixing, but this fix strikes me as bass
ackwards

THis bug was crippling for Vox type raids, anywhere where you do a buff circle
and log out... was taking so long for some of the people to log back in that the
people who didn't crash out were having their buffs wear off while waiting!
