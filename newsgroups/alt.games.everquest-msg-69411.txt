Since you can move spells around at will (Jazz tells you how, the docs also
tell you) set it up how ever you like.   *I* reserve a full page (1&2, 3&4,
etc) for types of spells.  Pages 1/2 are fire, 3/4 ice, 5/6 magic, 7/8
buffs, etc but that's just me.

As to trade skills, they're in the game almost exclusively just for you to
have something to do when you're tired of hack & slash.  It's rare that
someone comes even close to turning a profit except at high levels.
Tailoring is the best bet to make a little cash at low levels but you'd make
more by hacking & slashing.
