I'd been wondering that myself. Due to an experiment with a bag of
shark meat a couple months ago, my magician was barely level 7, but
had the offense, defense and melee skills of a capped level 3. I
started playing her again two nights ago, and had a friend toss skin
like nature on me so I could tank.

I got my 1hb and piercing up to 24, which fits the melee cap of
(level+1)x3. That one's pretty much set in stone :)

My offense went up to 28 and my defense to 33 by the time I was 3
yellows into 7, and then stopped rising. Her defense was 15 at the end
of level 3, and her offense was 12. Level 2 stats were offense 8 -
defense 10. (It seems offense (so very relevant for a pure caster :) )
is capped at 4x level, meaning someone crazy enough to cap it would do
so at level 35. Also, for some reason, no matter what the damage/delay
of my weapon, my atk is 111 at level 7 with 1hb and piercing capped -
it appears to depend only on my str and weapon skill. All this makes
me glad she's not supposed to melee in the near future!) 

Your level 1 and my level 3 stats seem to indicate 5x level, which
would give 35 for level 7. (level+5)x3 would give 36 for level 7,  but
if 33 *is* the cap, it's (level+4)x3. 

Hopefully, someone will have posted the actual cap structure before I
post this, but I'll keep tabs on my little gnome (she'll have a better
pet now, but I do intend to work on her defense so I should see caps)
and so far it looks like it's level x5, then (level+4)x3, then
(level+5)x3. and transitions are probably at level 6 and level 10.
