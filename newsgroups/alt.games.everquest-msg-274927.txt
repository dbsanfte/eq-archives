Is anyone out there working on their Dranik Loyalist faction for the
OoW quest armor?  Do you want to make it go faster?  Me too.

I'm able to solo the necessary faction mobs, but it's slow going.  When
I group with other people who are also working on faction, it goes so
much faster.  So in a desire to help get this faction easier, I thought
it might be a good idea to get everyone working together.

Where:  In the north-west corner of Dranik's Scar near the Bloodfield's
zone line
When:  Every Wednesday evening
Who:  Whoever wants to improve their Dranik Loyalist faction.

There are lots of mobs there around level 46 that give the right
faction.  Whatever server you're on, just show up there.
