I could be wrong, but I think initially the timer was relatively
short, then got upped to 24 hours?  It's been a while.

Even so, when it's your first character, you HAVE to find your corpse
to get your stuff.  My DE Necro had almost no gear back then, but it
was everything I owned  :D  I remember scraping the money for my first
backpack, and what a landmark event it was to me.  When I made my
first 100 plat, months later, I thought I'd made it, big-time  :)
