Doesn't really work that way with zoning I think. Ever notice that you 
can be on the phone with a friend while zoning into a zone that he is 
in, he can say "Oh, there you are" while on your end you're still 
zoning? Seems to me that there can be several seconds of your char being 
in zone before your client is there. A couple of days ago I zoned naked 
into PoN to get my corpse, when I arrive (or when my client arrives) I'm 
already half dead from a train to zone out/gy. Start moving towards the 
building with the click-thingie but I don't even get as far as the wall 
of the house before I'm dead. Had I already been inside when the train 
hit me (like if I had zoned in and stood still on the spot) I probably 
would have made it.

Still, I see what you mean about being careful around those areas. They 
shouldn't have put the zonein/gy so close to zone out, IMO. Plus you 
should be able to drag corpse at least a bit away from gy, wouldn't have 
to be very far.
