Last night my little necro found some good bargains in the bazaar.  I got my
120 PP out of the bank and ran over to the first trader.  I went to buy the
item and got the message "you cannot afford item".  Then I went linkdead.
When I logged back on the money was gone.  Checked the bank, not there either. 
Did a /who all GM.  No go.  Someone suggested sending a petition anyway.  So I
sent a long explanation of exactly what happened.  Waited around for another 20
minutes... then went afk and went to bed.  This morning I run over to the bank
and when I clicked it, oh happy day, the money popped into my account.  
I don't care what anyone says.... customer service is not dead :)
