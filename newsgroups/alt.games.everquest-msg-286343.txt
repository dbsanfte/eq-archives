This is mostly out of curiosity, since I've got 25+ more levels before
I need to go and find him, but did anyone ever *really* find out what
was up with the AC?  I can't find anything more recent than 2001 or so
in my Google searching.  Was some real method found, did everyone just
decide it was random, do people even get jboots anymore?  I heard they
revamped North/South Ro and the Oasis and was curious if he was still
there.
