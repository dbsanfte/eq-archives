If you want to blame someone, blame the a**hole buyers who think it's fun
to harass sellers.  The reason I don't put the price in the post is that
I'm often selling at value, and if I broadcast that I want full value, I
will often get harassing comments.  

Of course, I will usually dare to be brace, and respond in a tell what I
am looking for, but even then I'll get "LMAO, nm" or something similarly
clever. :T  

Of course, what I'm saying has been said before...and probably better. I
feel like Im' responding just so the scripted conversation about "make
offer" can progress to the next level. :T
