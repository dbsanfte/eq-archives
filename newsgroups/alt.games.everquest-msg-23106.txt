Grobb and Ogguk for starters. You'll be non-KOS to the guards but some
of the guilds will still hate you, so get a map and avoid Shadowknight
guilds etc. It does mean you can safely run around Innothule and Feerott
though.

Feerott is a great place for tailors to stock up on spiderling silk -
spiderlings are everywhere (take em out en masse with a tremor etc, plus
you can often buy stacks of the stuff at the vendors there since the
newbie ogres will offload them).

Be aware that wolf-form drops on zoning, so have invis up when entering
Grobb or Ogguk in case a guard has been trained to the zone.

Also, brownies won't attack you in wolf-form, so LFay is now reasonably
safe. You can safely buy/sell from the LFay brownies to get thicken mana
etc for all your enchanter friends. Do your symbol of Tunare quests
while you're here, and hunt Thistle Underbrush for braided ivy cords in
between spawns.

Wolf form also makes most animals non-aggro, so you can wander the
Karanas in relative safety.

I think all the planes require you to be level 46, I could be wrong
though.
