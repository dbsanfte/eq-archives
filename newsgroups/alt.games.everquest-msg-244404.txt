Actually, if you can't get a group, FD goes up pretty fast on normal 
usage when you solo (unless you are so twinked that you never find 
yourself *having* to use it). I can understand that if you group all the 
time it could lag behind, though.

But hey, if you don't like the class, by all means roll a Berserker or 
something. I'm having a blast with my Monk, to such an extent that my 
Druid hardly sees the light of day anymore.
