It is a faction related issue.  Mobs have "hidden" factions (as in you won't
necessarily get a faction hit killing them) that decide whether they will
help each other or not.  If a mob is being "helped" then it won't gate.

A good place to see this in action is PG named, where they generally stand
in a room with two friends.  Many named are, ironically, easier to pull than
the placeholders because they aren't the same "faction" as the other mobs in
their room so will come single, whereas to kill the placeholder will require
splitting.

Mobs choosing to try to run away is dependent on the same criteria, so in
addition to killing the gaters first, you also want to make sure the last
mob to die in a multi-pull is snared even if the others don't try to run.
