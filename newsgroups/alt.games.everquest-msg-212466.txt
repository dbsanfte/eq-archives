Holy cow.. where do you place all those windows? I keep two open...
One for all the 'spam' and the other for chats... 
I figure either u play on a very large monitor or u don't have much in
the way of viewing area... 
Perhaps you could post a screenshot.. i would be interested in seeing
how you manage to configure that..
