In a good group, you have high melee damage.  Get 50% haste on all the
meleers and you're killing mobs 50% faster.  That's 50% less damage
your tanks take.  

You can go back and run the math anyway you want (and yes, this game
is completely number driven).  Haste is more critical than mana regen.

This usually is a clue to the mentality of the player you are.
When I see a cleric in a Velk group, it's "shit, another syphon on
exp".  Clerics are NOT needed, nor desired.  Nobody will die?  Fuck
me, I wasn't dying the last four hours hunting there with just a
shaman.  Why would I suddenly run a risk of dying now?

Let me guess, you think a 3 spider pull is a situation that "needs"
crowd control right?
