Bah.

Try being a Paladin.  For just one stage of our epic weapon, you need a
drop off of Lord Nagafen the dragon.  This *ALWAYS* requires a major
force (30+ people, give or take), and the raid takes all evening usually.
Of course, he doesn't drop it every time.  And if he doesn't, you get to
wait a full week (real time, not game time) for him to spawn again.
And when he does finally drop it, you have to win the roll against all
the other Paladins who'd like the book as well.  So conservatively speaking,
you have to go on about 10-20 successful Nagafen raids before you can get
the book.

You're complaining about sitting on your butt in a green-to-you dungeon
for five hours?  Don't make me laugh.

Oh...  And the other half of the book drops off of Lady Vox, the other
dragon in Antonica, so if you're a Paladin you get to do all of the above
with HER also, or else no epic for you.  And Vox is tougher than Nagafen,
and Complete Heals herself during battle if you're not careful, so a lot
of Vox raids end in Total Party Wipeout, and corpse recoveries from
underneath a cranky dragon...

Five hours, you say?
