I just bought two spells in Qeynos that were 3 pp 5gp each.
Yet I was only charged the gp for them,  I had about 5 pp
and 10gp when i went in to the shop and came out with 2
songs that should have been a total of 7pp and 10 gp yet
only paid 10 for them.

Anyone else seen this or did I just get lucky?
