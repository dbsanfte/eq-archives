You own the media.  You don't own the game software, you said so yourself.
You are paying to be granted a license to use it by the owner (in this case
SoE).  And if you don't agree to those terms, and keep in mind you must
agree to them before you can create an account, then you can sell the CDs
with unused CD keys to someone else with no consequences.
