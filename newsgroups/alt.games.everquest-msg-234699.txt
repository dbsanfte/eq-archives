The judge.  Seriously, you didn't know this?  How can you possibly
contribute constructively to this discussion if you don't understand even
the most basic structures of our legal system?  You're like a guy who
believes the universe revolves around the earth trying to argue astronomy.

Both parties argue their case before the judge, demonstrating why the judge
should apply the relevant law in their favor, and after the trial's done,
the judge makes his decision in favor of one of the parties.  This is, of
course, a simplified version of a civil trial.

That's a different situation.  There were disputes of fact in the OJ case,
as does every criminal case that goes to trial in fact.  He said he didn't
do it, which is a factual rather than a legal dispute.  That's for a jury,
not a judge, to decide.  What facts are in dispute if SOE goes after IGE?
It's not as if IGE can claim they're not selling platinum, after all.

Seriously, you didn't know this?  I suppose I shouldn't be surprised since
you cite OJ when you're talking about a potential civil action.

By the way, if your response to this is more ad hominem and arguments where
you quite obviously don't have the slightest idea what you're talking about,
spare yourself.  If you can't make this much of an effort to overcome your
ignorance, there's no point in continuing this discussion with you.
