Greetings,

I need to kill Gorenaire, the famed Dreadlands dragon, for a sub-quest of the Paladin Epic
1.0 . Obtaining my Fiery Defender is not a high priority, but it would be nice to be
actively working on it again.

(For the knowledgeable Paladins: the Plane of Hate MOB might still be bugged, which would
prevent obtaining the FD, but I should be able to complete the FA quest without any
problems.)

It has occurred to me that I might have an easier time locating Gorenaire (and nailing
down the spawn) if I create a tracking mule and park him in DL. 

Which class has the best tracking ability at lower levels? What level would I need to
attain to get reliable results? Having never had a tracker...will I see mob names and
locations, or what will I see? Where in DL would you recommend that I park this tracker?

Best regards,

Tim ==
