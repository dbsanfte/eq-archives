I agree.  The zone as it's laid out is great ... city with a bank in the
middle of the zone, two good newbie hunting areas, a good lowbie area on Orc
Hill, and close to three other pretty good zones (Crushbone, Butcherblock,
and AkAnon).

Problem is, the d00dz and beggars really have overrun the place.  On weekend
nights it's pretty much unplayable.  Weekday evenings are better, but a lot
of times I still have to pretty much turn off everything but guild chat to
be able to tolerate it.  You can't lend a hand to anyone .... if you help
one newbie with an item or buff, you're overrun with people in your face
expecting the same.

East Commons is almost as bad (at least on Cazic Thule).  I never hunt there
... too crowded.  When in Freeport, I tend to favor the Ro side rather than
the Commons.  For some reason, NRo usually has half the number of players
that East Commons has at any given time.  I really don't understand that  ..
the Derv camps are XP factories, and if you get bored of Dervs you can pop
over to Oasis and hunt some crocs or orcs.
