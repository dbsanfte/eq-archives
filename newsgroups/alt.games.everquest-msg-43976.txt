OK, well I have been playing UO for 3 years and EQ for 2 years (with a break
in there), and I still play both, so I can help with any UO <> EQ
comparisons (as will others here). EQ has a few servers which are dedicated
PvP servers, once you log on, and meet the level requirements you are open
slather, each different PvP server operates under different rules sets to
decide who can attack who. The majority of the servers are basically non
PvP - however you can declare yourself as a PvPer and fight others that do
similar - but *no one* does that. At the log in screen you can tell which
are the PvP servers, by 2 ways, first, they are all have a the name Zek
involves, eg, Tallon Zek, Vallon Zek, Rallos Zek, and also at the log in
screen it says (PvP Server) :). So if you want to avoid PvP just choose a
server that inst PvP designated.

Communication in EQ is vastly different to that in UO. Norrath (the world of
EQ) is divided into "zones", and is not just one big world like UO is. When
you move to a different "zone" there is actually a small loading time and
you completely leave one zone and go into another. So this effects the way
EQ handles communication. When you are in a particular zone, you can
broadcast messages to everyone in the zone, through the use of some
commands, they are /shout /ooc (out of character) and /auction (use for
selling / buying wares). So with these commands you can communicate with
others to organise hunting parties.  The way it works is that you enter the
zone or area you want to hunt and then via the /shout or /ooc command you
will say something like "Level 5 Warrior Looking for a group", what will
happen then is that if people need extras in there hunting party they will
let you know. Hunting is alot more social in Eq that it is in UO.

Most of your hunting time will be spent in groups, generally with people you
dont know. When you hunt, the tendancy to get established at one particular
spot and "camp" that spot. The warrior types will then bring the monsters to
this camp spot and they are fought at that camp spot. Once the battle is
over there is generally a down time, and this is the time alot of banter and
"socialising" goes on - and this is how you meet others and build
friendships. EQ is class / race based, when you make a character you choose
the class (eg warrior, cleric, bard, necromancer, druid, shaman, etc) and a
race (human, wood elf, half elf, barbarian, troll, ogre, etc). So when it
comes to fighitng a good group is a well balanced group, with a mixture of
warrior types, healing types and enchanters (grin).

I hope some of what I said makes sense, and honestly I would definately
recommend giving it a go. If the initial cost of the game isnt too much of a
worry, thats the worse it going to cost you, as like UO, you get your first
month free.
Here a few web sites you should look at fo rmore info:
