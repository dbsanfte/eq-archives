1. You thought wrong. He didn't even say 'quite often', he just said
'often'.
2. Since when is asking for opinions on dealing with a moron who
insists on inhabiting the zone you're in not a legit question?

3. No reason he should say that, since that isn't what he meant. 
4. You, however, did exactly as he expected and reinforced his point,
other than using your new word of the day 'pinhead' rather than
calling him an 'ignorant fuck'.

5. At this point it was a discussion, not a question. Ever heard of
rational discussions? This is usenet, not a Q&A session.
6. You have no way of knowing the work habits of those who happen to
have time to glance over messages during work hours, or even just have
time to check the group for a patch message they know might be there
even though they won't be downloading the patch themself for hours.

7. That amnesia must be bad; you forgot to call him a pinhead.
8. It was quoted below, but was apparently irrelevant since it wasn't
a question.

9. P&H isn't the topic of this thread. You and your attitude are.

>not just a bunch of namecalling. 

10. You're the one doing the namecalling (even though much can be said
for the lameness of calling someone a 'pinhead')

11. Right, he made up all those quoted responses to your non-archived
posts, since you can't remember a single one of them and anything that
isn't a question is irrelevant.
12. You're the one wasting hundreds of lines not saying a fucking
thing - like you often do. (Not usually hundreds of lines in one post,
I'll give you that much)

>>> just to show you what an ignorant fuck
>>>you've apparently just made of yourself.

>Nice thrashing around by the way.

13. IF you are capable of spouting anything that makes sense, exactly
how do you feel he's proven himself as an ignorant fuck? Your calling
him that does not constitute proof.
14. In a way, I'm glad to see 'ignorant fuck' is back again. 'Pinhead'
got old really fast.

[rant claiming, um, probably that the quoted material wasn't proof in
between all the rambling about Dan]

15. Dan, I think he wants you to hack his computer and get his
original posts before he'll accept anything as proof. And with his
paranoia, he's probably erased them.

>Go apply for a job at the circus, I understand that Zippy is retiring.

16. Damn, the pinhead angle is back again...

17. Spoken as a true connoiseur of people.

18. If you have no time for these killfiled 'pinheads', why do you
always get your panties in a bunch when a quote shows that they've
followed up on something you've posted? It reflects more on your
intelligence than on theirs.
19. Here's a novel suggestion, bizbee: try taking it like a man
instead of cornering yourself with even more proof of how little
you're capable of being a selective, reasonable flamer.
