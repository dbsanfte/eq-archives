Sorta depends, but the answer is almost always the +40 Mana item.  Down the
road as you get better equipment and as you start using KEI more and more,
your INT will be maxed anyway, so you'll get more of a benefit from the
+MANA items.

If you're currently below 200 INT, then I would definitely keep the +4 INT
item.
