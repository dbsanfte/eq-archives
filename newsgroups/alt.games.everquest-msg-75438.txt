Well, im a cleric of 49 seasons and am thinking of looking into the
Thurg quest armor that Jazzman setup a nice informative webpage for.

So, Im on the Quellious server.  Is this place tough for pickup
groups?  Is it Raid only?  Any special notes that a person should
know? (like the orcs in Oasis...   the "an" and the "a" Orc)
Any particular giants drop the Corroded Plat Greaves?
and on the  + 3 chipped onyx sapphires are these bought or drop only?
if dropped, any particular "known" creature or place for the drop?

As usual, your time and information is appreciated.
