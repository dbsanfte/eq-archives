Strangely enough, I dont think "character transfers" of items and cash
really add to the "roleplaying" of the game... it's not really realistic for
a character who is a 57th level barbarian have access to the same account as
a 3rd level Ranger....  does it?  No.. character item transfers, etc., kind
of remove from the REAL gaming experience.. it's more of a cheat tactic.
Twink this so I don't have to really play the first few levels like everyone
else...
