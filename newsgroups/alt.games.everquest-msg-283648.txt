Good point, but of course it A) takes mana and B) requires quite a few 
levels, and C) as you point out, allows less mana per tic from medding.

BUT in all honesty D) forgot all about it.  Did I mention its been a 
long time since I played a necro?

Does FD last indefinately, even though its spell based (I know the monk 
one does)?

I was also hoping I'd be able to use vendors while in hide, can you do 
that in FD?  I know you can with sneak, but DE don't get sneak, nor do 
Necros.  Any character able to use all vendors is decidedly easier to 
play than one who has to worry about faction, so thats something to 
think about.
