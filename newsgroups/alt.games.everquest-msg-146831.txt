As a cleric, I did not buy my horse for the running speed. I bought
the second cheapest horse available, so my running still ain't that
great -- though it DOES outrun all mobs I've encountered (currently
level 42).

I bought it for the auto-med feature, which has saved mine and my
parties' lives more times than I can count.  For a caster, it is
definately worth it.  For melees, though, I'd say it's sort of a
waste.
