Just curious--I know there are a few bard-type good race NPCs (about
level 10-ish) that hang out in Innothule Swamp that KOS evil races.  I
know where at least one of them is--some guy named Derk Darkslinger or
something like that who is immediately to the left (south) of the
Grobb entrance; he seems to stay in one place, though, so he can
usually be avoided.  Where are the other good race NPC's in Innothule
located, and are they also stationary (and thus easy to avoid) or do
they like to roam?

Thanks in advance,
