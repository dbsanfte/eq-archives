    The biggest problem with this solution isn't the "lockout timer" issue 
you went on to describe, but rather a design issue. By locking players out 
from repeating content, you're limiting the content value of a given 
encounter. You now need to make more unique encounters to keep players 
occupied for the same amount of time. Given that design time is a far bigger 
issue than immersion, I don't imagine you'll see a game base itself around 
non-repeatable content. I like mini-instances but as set-piece encounter 
settings, not as one shot experiences.

    However, some things can be flagged as non-repeatable without damaging 
replay value. For example, quests resulting in No Drop items should be 
flagged such that the quest giver doesn't give out the quest to someone who 
has completed it. That would be immersive, wouldn't damage repeat gameplay, 
and would allow for exceptional rewards to be handed out. EQ has gone this 
route with the Epic 1.5 and 2.0 quests, and it works rather nicely. Only 
people "flagged" as being at a certain stage in their epic can loot certain 
quest-related items, spawning additional loot which can be distributed to 
helpers. The quests also yield 5 AA points as a reward, something that 
couldn't be done if the quests were repeatable.
