Hi everyone:

I've soloed my Wizard to level 53 and whilst I enjoy him immensely I've
started to turn my thoughts towards making an alt, mainly just to break from
the monotony of soloing. After giving a lot of consideration I started an
Enchanter, which is as far away from a Wizard in playing terms as you can
get. My question is simply this ..

Enchanters have a huge array of buffs, most of them require that you select
a target first, hence the red gem in the slot. I want to set up some macros
that will select ME first and then cast a spell on MYSELF .. Something like
this ... Assume slot one contains a target required strength buff ..

/target <mychar>
/cast 1

Can this be done? I've typed in my name between the <>'s but still no luck
..

Many thanks to all that help me .. and safe travels to you all ..

Stevie.
