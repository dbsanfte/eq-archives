Be careful how you phrase that. SWG has big things, like AT-ATs, krayt 
dragons, etc, shake the ground (screen) when they walk. I'm not the 
motion sickness type, and I get a bit queasy fighting the things over time.

Final Fantasy online has those. They are a config option (overhead, in 
chat box, both). I think EOoA uses the pop up numbers too... In FF they 
are fairly unobtrusive. I remember seeing an early beta of EQoA (had a 
friend that got in real real early... ) that had numbers that would have 
to be shrunk if they were 'jersey numbers' on the back of the 
characters. Single digits were bigger than gnomes! it was insane! (not 
quite that bad, but you get the point)

Please let those be able to be turned off. We hates them, my precious. 
They are almost as bad as designing for 3rd person view, yes my precious.

The sound yes. The earth moving.. well if it's not overdone it's a 
really cool effect. When half the mobs shake the ground, it's bad. Final 
Fantasy uses it well, apparently reserving it for the largest and the 
'boss' mobs. I've seen two so far, and one was a mobile tree about the 
size of a sand giant.
