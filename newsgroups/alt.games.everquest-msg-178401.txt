Of course it could.  But I am unwilling to pay for it.  And I don't
think you'll find very many people who would be.  Not only would
subscription costs rocket, but frequency of updates would decline.
Keep in mind that a lot of the detailed function spec of EQ gives
a whole new meaning to the phrase "moving target".  They don't have
any reasonable way to determine how a lot of encounters and player
abilities are going to game-out until after they see them in action.
A game that had the sort of reliability you're talking about would
be incredibly expensive to play and far less interesting than EQ.
Most of the "bugs" in EQ have been content related, not game-engine
or basic communications code like the bugged comm layer that caused
so many problems with this last update.

Of course it's a calculated risk.  Even in very highly reliable systems
downtime is a calculated risk.  They just work with different parameters
than low cost entertainment systems like MMORPGs or ultra low cost (i.e.
free to user) entertainment sites like pogo.

I don't know whether SOE could do noticeably better at a low enough
cost to make it justifiable for the business, and I'm pretty sure that
there is no chance at all of them providing me enough information to
make that judgement.  Given that, it seems to me that there's really no
point in what amounts to speculation about the issue, and it's just
silly to make pronouncements about what they can or should do.  YMMV.
