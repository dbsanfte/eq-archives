Wandering through WK last night with camouflage on checking out the
mountain areas. Was following a hill giant when it wandered into a
group of ogres. The ogres started bashing on it so I sat back and
watched.

The ogres conned amiable to me. Isn't this supposed to mean their
friendly ? I was camouflaged so I guess they can see invisible too.
Anyway thinking they were friendly I went up for a close look at one
of them. Next thing he starts beating on me. Then something called
chief something-or-anothers pet started on me and I was dead in two
seconds.

I had only just hit level 18 so I though no big deal won't lose much
experience. Unfortunately I had gone back to level 17 so I guess you
can really lose a lot of experience if you die a lot of times. 

Cheers,
