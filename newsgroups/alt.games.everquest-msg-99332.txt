Ring - 15% reduction in cast time
only works on spells with cast times
4secs - 9.5 seconds.  FoH raised
a ruckus about how 8.5 second C. Heals
would trivialize high end encounters.

They also don't like the damage bracer,
and want it reduced.  Remember, the
bracer has a MAX bonus of 20%, the min
appears to be 0-5% (no rigorous testing,
and the DD's for near normal damage might
have been boosted partial resists).  So
the average damage bonus for the bracer
is ~10%.

Hardly overpowered if you ask me.  They
also have a big gripe with *how* these
are obtained at the moment.  According
to them, no summoned item should be so
good that people will take off NToV loot
to wear it.  Personally, I think it just
shows how unimportant much caster gear is.
I lose 10ish int (102 mana at 51) to put
on the full set (I can't summon the highest
ear/ring/bracer).  The full set adds 70mana/hp
and all focus effects.  The thing that
people don't realize is that the folks who
were involved have such high end gear, they
were probably still well over 200 int after
the gear removal.  A small reduction in mana pool
for reduced cast times and greater damage is
a no brainer for most casters.  The big
negative of these versus existing caster gear
is resists.  I expect dropped focuses to have
better (to exceptional for NToV level drops)
stats, and the same or better focus effects.
