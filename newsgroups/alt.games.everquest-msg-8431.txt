My @home cable modem has a built-in hub in the back.  Just plug your network
cables into the back and you're ready to go.

Go to your local cable service provider's website and see if you can look at
a technical breakdown of the modem you'll be getting.  Sometimes a picture
is all you'll need.

Or call their customer service and ask tech support for the make and model
nuimber of their modem... you might be able to find one on a search of the
web.  Ours is a Cisco Systems uBR900
