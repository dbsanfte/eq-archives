She was in east freeport by the dismal rage trainers in the middle of
the area between xelha and her buddies and the door leading to opal
darkbriar and the dark elf cleric from neriak. So she basically cut
evil types off who were KOS with bloodsabers from getting to the Evil
warrior trainer that for example my ogre warrior who relocated at
level 2 was using to train (faction with dismal rage very easy to
raise as opposed to with neriak) 

Verant saw error of their ways I guess and stuck her in west freep off
by self then.
