Im casting darkness to snare the mob, not for the dps. (My pet and splurt
handle that nicely) Now with a shorter duration Ill probably have to cast 3
snares per fight instead of 2. This will make soloing harder. (=nerf in my
book)
The fact that other dots work faster is nice, so maybe you could argue that
overall it isnt a nerf. Personally Id prefer they left it alone and we kept
our extra duration snares.
