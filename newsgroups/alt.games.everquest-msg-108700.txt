Depends how far away from a gem vendor, how many dots I have and where
I am.  Usually naltron main tank, chanter.  Necro's will usually have
some peridots, or won't ask for naltron.  I do still carry around
several stacks of jaspers, old habit from pinzarn days.  Got a ten
slot quest container thats small items only, try and keep it full of
gems. 4 stacks of jasper, 4-5 peridots and some pearls.  Hit the
vendor often tho.

Hardly ever get compesated for gems.  Maybe on a raid will get 10 up
front, maybe let me have an item that I can actually use, or a cleric
spell that drops, if I did a good job.  Other than that its "heal me,
sit down and shut up. Oh btw can I have 10.5 plats?"  Just kidding,
they love me. they really do...
