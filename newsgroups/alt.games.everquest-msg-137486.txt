If there is no violation of the rules, why would a
GM turn up?

So why can't I sell those items for cash, if I own
them?

You can't have it both ways.

About the same amount of times I have heard a GM
say "oh.. you dropped your fungi tunic and 20k
plat, logged out, and it was gone when you
returned. Here are replacements, now don't be such
a silly billy next time"

True though, regardless of what weight you choose
to assign it.
