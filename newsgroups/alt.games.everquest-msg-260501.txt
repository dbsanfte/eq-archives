Originally by running between two landmarks that were about a minute's run
apart and timing how long it took.  Later, I switched to just starting
running in an open area, then hitting at the same time my /loc button with
one hand and a stopwatch with the other, waiting about 10 seconds, and then
hitting /loc and stopping the stopwatch, and then getting the distance from
the /loc values, and dividing by the time, to get speed.

Trying this under a variety of conditions gave repeatable and consistent
results.
