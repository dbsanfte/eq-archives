Well the original stash came from dwarves in butcher block and seafuries in
ocean of tears. Dwarves where relatively easy kills and always dropped a
22pp axe , a random armor or weapon worth 5pp and 5pp in cash. Seafuries had
a 20% drop rate on medium level gems which also averaged out at about 20pp
per kill . Giants averaged out at about 10pp per kill . Some of the upper
level guards also averaged out at giant level or above . All of these have
been nerfed to hell and gone.

Some relatively easy items to farm also sold to merchants for 100-200pp
which could easily equal the rate of the dorf hunters. They dropped much
less frequently but the pay out over time was good.

If I was in need of farming plat I would solo either the iksar necromancers
or the bugs in sebilis if either camp was open. While this may not be a
great payout for time it is not bad . (nothing equals the old dwarves
though)
