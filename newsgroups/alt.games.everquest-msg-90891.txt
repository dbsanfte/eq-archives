Anyone else have a problem with machine hanging after the graphic engine
patch few days ago?  I have been getting problems such as screen freezes and
the machine just stop dead, this occurs randomly it seems and I have died
more then a dozen time cos of this problem.  Also have the "kick to desktop"
problem and the machine sometimes just reset itself.

This really sucks, I have reported the problems in /bug more then a few
times hoping they would do something about it in this patch and did they?  I
also e-mailed the tech centre and all i got from them was a acknowledgement
e-mail, doh.... wonder what service we should expect for buying all these
extension packs and paying them monthly.....
