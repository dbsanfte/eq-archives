LoL thats a good one, however I do admit to not ever having played a
rogue, have played both of the other pure melee classes and most
hybred though. The fact I know they (plate class and monk) do more
damage ( uber AAs withstanding) than the wiz is shown by the parses
not an impression or wild ass guess. Hitting in the 100-300 point
range every few seconds is just more than the wiz can do without
inviting a CR, concussion or no..remember this is non-raid. Ahh well
enough is enough. Still maintain melees are doing fine as is while
damage casters have been left behind.
