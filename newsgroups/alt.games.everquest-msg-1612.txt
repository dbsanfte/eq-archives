I hate to tell you but I know (personally) the GM responsible for this.
A long, long time ago those dimensional pockets and NO_RENT items were a lot
easier to use... There was some issue where you could put them in the bank
and they would stay forever... just unbank them each time you log in... it
really helped when high level people would summon their good weapons for me
and others. That hig hdamage was good at lvl 5

The dimensional bags would stay until you camped, but if you went LD they
would NOT VANISH!!!
This was really good, but some people began going LD on purpose instead of
camping to keep them forever...  IT WORKED TOO!!!
Then I mentioned it to someone who worked with me in the summers he said
"I'm going to report that!"
Little did I know he was an EQ GM at his winter job!!!
Well theres the story - after that the bags vanish when you go LD and cant
be saved in the bank.

So remember - if you ever shop at XXXXX (name removed for security - heehh)
never talk about your EQ Secrets.
