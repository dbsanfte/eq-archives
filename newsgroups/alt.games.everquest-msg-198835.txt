In a guild of 50 people, 2 people a week means 25 weeks to flag everyone.  
during that time, flagged people will be playing in tier 2 zones, unflagged 
will be playing elsewhere, and feeling left out.  I was in a decent family 
and friends guild, and, while I won't say we never had problems, flagging 
was the thing that ended up actually causing a split.  There were 
inevitable personality conflicts happenning all along, but, flagging was 
the one thing that finally really caused it to happen.

So, I suppose that if we assume the perfect happy family guild where there 
are no conflicts, and everyone is always wonderful and cheerful, then, 
sure, they will have no real issues with flagging.  If, on the other hand, 
we suppose a more typical guild, where there are some people who don't get 
along with some others, there are other issues that have occured, regarding 
loot, or where raids occur, or when raids occur, or people wondering why 
they aren't getting the help they need for their epic, well, then flagging 
can be the final straw.  It really is that much more stressful than the 
other issues that preceded it.  Just from my personal experience.

I know, you will point out that, well, then the guild I was did not have 
the proper attitude, and, perhaps that is true, but, guilds are made up of 
people, people are not perfect, people have problems.  Stressful situations 
exacerbate this.  The issue of flagging, and just how difficult it can be 
to pass the trials is extremely stressful.  I know people who have tried 
trials groups for weeks on end, literally trying 100s of times and not 
passing.  It is not the type of thing that is designed to engender a great 
deal of interest in going back and doing it again once you have passed.  I 
cannot think of any other single thing in the game pre high end raiding 
zones that raises the same issues, and causes anywhere near as much stress.
