    Ssra is a blessing and a curse. As a raid zone for boss mobs, it works
very well. Moving to a boss mob from zone is usually pretty quick (and in
places quite challenging), CotH is enabled but there's no real safe spots
you can CotH a raid to without fighting in, excepting the basement and the
Cursed cycle. There's a wide variety of difficulty levels in the encounters
there, multiple raids can take place at once without lag being too bad as
long as they're on different floors, the fights themselves require a great
deal of strategy for the most part, and the loot is spectacular. There's
also a number of triggered mobs, with no way to actually "blow" the triggers
so guilds who are at one level can kill the triggers, and later guilds at
another level can kill the triggered mobs.

    As a single/two-group area, the place is a complete flop. There's two
places that small groups fight inside, the mines and the rest of the zone.
The mines are as poorly pathed as could possibly be, filled with
chain-aggroing skeletons (some of which have harm touch), and itemized
almost at random. Because you need the rare drop from the named mobs in the
mines to get Shissarbane weapons to fight the Emperor, you end up spending a
lot of time in the mines. The only thing that makes it bearable is that the
skeletons there have no heal aggro, so I can CH the puller as he's incoming
with four skeletons and get no aggro whatsoever.

    The snakes are very poorly done. The hallways, the only real "safe spots
" to set up in a lot of cases, are cramped and the odd shape causes snakes
pushed into the walls to warp a lot. (Snakes also warp to different floors
if a door closes when they're in the doorway, but I digress.) The snakes
were the prototypes for the NPC caster changes introduced recently - they
have, since SoL went live, always cast spells above their actual level.
Given their actual level is 51 and 55 or so, you can imagine the fun that
ensues. They don't move so much as warp from place to place, likely because
of the size of the models relative to the size of the environment. Since one
needs a rare spawn from the first floor, one from the second floor, an
uncommon drop from snakes in the basement, and a drop off uncommon-spawn
raid-level snakes in another area to get the key to the Emperor's area (one
required per person), you have to deal with this crappy design for quite
some time. There are some other "named" snakes that one could camp, but they
drop stuff that ranges from garbage (gloves with a +lockpick modifier) to
toys (Vah Shir mask, group Acumen, the spell for that shaman PE spell off
the VP hammer). The XP is awful, as you're slowly chewing through tough mobs
(at least mines XP is fair).

    Now, you need to kill this stuff to get to the place folks really want
to raid, Vex Thal. So every day you have to pry people away from "real" XP
camps and tradeskills and their alts and having fun and make them wait at
zone-in until a group of them can form up and move in to continue farming
this crap. And, because of the difficulty level involved, it can't be any
six people but rather has to be a balanced party. That means people sit and
wait for clerics to log on, or bards/enchanters to log on. And if you leave,
others in the guild will single you out and scold you for not contributing
to the effort to get past this hurdle. It is just god-awful. The fact that
the actual "key" you get after all this camping is a very nice ring (Ring of
the Shissar) is irrelevant - people feel like a ton of their time is being
wasted doing things that just aren't fun. So they start asking themselves
"why do I play EQ", and many of them decide the rewards way down the road
can't justify the camp and quit the game.

    Planes of Power supposedly has "progressive keys", or some such thing.
All I know is if the timesinks are anything like the ones we've encountered
in Ssra, a ton of people in my guild will quit EQ. They've already said
they'll do this once, but never again. And I don't blame them.

    James
