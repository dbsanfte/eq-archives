Ok been to EqShaman.com and have found a little information on the
Cannibalize 2 spell quest.  I've heard different stories on this spell and
the quest was wondering if I could get some help or answers on it please.
1.  Is Cannibalize 2 a no drop quest spell?
2.  Is there a way for evil faction races (i.e. Iksar) to do the quest with
having to worry about getting whacked by merchants near by other quest NPC.

Thanks again in advance.

Frederick J.
