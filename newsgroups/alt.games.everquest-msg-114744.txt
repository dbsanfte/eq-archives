Hehe, is that unbuffed or self buffed?

I'm at 780-something with spikecoat and skin like nature at 52, and even
more when raid buffed (shield of words/aego, harnessing, etc)  and I've
still got 9 more points of defense to get.

Also, if you have a profile or something of your equipment, I'd kind of like
to see it if you don't mind, just blatant voyeurism I suppose (although I do
have occasional spasms of superiority when I see a level 50+ druid wearing
Split Paw gloves)

If you care, I've got a magelo profile at
