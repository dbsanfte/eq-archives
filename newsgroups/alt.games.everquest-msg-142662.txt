It's been 6 years since I was afforded the luxury of voting for a
candidate (neither you nor hughes would like him), always seems like
it's a choice of which evil to vote against this time:
the idiot?  the buffoon?  the soulless servant of the machine?
the corrupt populist?  the spineless servant of the polls?
the single-issue obsessed tool of [insert_your_interest_group_here]?


Oh well, at least we've got the vote and the jury still
(and we get lots of bread and circuses too).
