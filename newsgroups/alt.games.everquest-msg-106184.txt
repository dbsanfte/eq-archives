I'll pre-order at my local EB store (under the double-points loyalty card
scheme) but that's about it...

I'll get the chance to buy my copy on day of retail release (they put a copy
to one side for me) and at any time within 10 days and still get the loyalty
bonus (4% of purchase instead of 2%)

If I decide not to buy, or wait more than 10 days, I don't loose anything
:o)
