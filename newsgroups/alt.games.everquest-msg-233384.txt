... must... destroy... mace... 

Seriously. How in the world could they release a trailer when a mace
with what's supposed to be a steel ball bounces around like a freakin'
balloon? That is annoying.

Also, the bit about "the player can do it without ever having to kill
a monster" bit sounds like total rubbish. I mean seriously, who is
ACTUALLY going to start playing and NEVER kill a monster? Half of the
game is exploration. I'm guessing to explore, you have to kill.

Was I also the only one creeped out when the guy said "You can even
form bonds and relationships with NPC's"?
