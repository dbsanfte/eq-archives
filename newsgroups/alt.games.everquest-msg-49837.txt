Well for online RPG's, "Dark Age of Camelot" just came out. The guy at EB
talked me into buying it telling me it was like EQ, but everything that was
wrong with EQ they had it right in this game. It looks fantastic I must say,
but for some reason its so slow on my machine that it's virtually
unplayable, so I deleted my account within 20 minutes of creating it. It
requires a 3D card above Voodoo 2, and since I have a Voodoo 3 that was
probably the reason. I'm sending it back to the store but you may wanna take
a look at the game.
