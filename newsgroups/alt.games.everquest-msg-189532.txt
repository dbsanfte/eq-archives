I have been playing Everquest for 3 years now, while my highest character
is level 37, I have wandered around Norrath many times, been in many
groups and consider myself well versed in the roles of most if not all
classes in a group.  The way I learned?  I listened to the people who had
more experience than me, and learned from them.  Last night I had the
honor (and I honestly do consider it an honor) to shape the everquest
careers of 4 other people, 4 newbies; untwinked, not power leveled, people
struggling to save a few PP to buy that next item.

I was in Everfrost playing an alt of mine and someone had asked where a
good place to hunt was, I did a level check and it was an 18 Rogue.  I
informed him that hunting Mammoths and their calfs here would be good
experience and that the tusks were worth a decent amount of plat.  I got a
tell from him thanking him for the advice.  I told him no problem and that
if he wanted I could bring in my druid and we could try to get a group
together (druid is level 21).  The rogue agreed and I /camp.

I log on my druid, PoK it over to Everfrost and meet up wit the rogue.
By the time I got there had had found people wanting to group.  We head
over to (what they called 2 trees, <grandpa>We used to call it the hill
near bandl</grandpa>)  They killed their then invited us in.  In the group
we had Druid(me), Rogue(new friend), Shaman, Warrior, Warrior.  Heavy on
melee, perfect for Mammoths.  One of the warriors wants a pull and the
shaman and another warrior head out (first mistake I mentally note),
shaman comes back with a Mammoth (adult) and proceeds to be the MT (second
mistake), everyone is all over the place, just whacking away at this thing
(third mistake).  Mammoth dies, and I suggest we head out to North Tower,
lots to hunt out there.  Everyone agrees, we head out.

We get to North Tower and I med up, Shaman goes out to pull, a Warrior
runs off to do the same.  I say in group tell that we only need one
puller, and or warrior to come back.  I ask who is MT and get MT? MT? MT?
With only the rogue knowing what MT actually meant.  I think to myself,
"Wow these guys really are new."  The Shaman announces inc, and I notice
its x2, full grown mammoths.  I announce that Ill kite one away, and that
they need to take one and get aggro on it.  I could see the blank looks on
their faces even through the computer.  Both mammoths come back, Shaman
again tanking, I tell her to back off let the warriors do it, she needs to
heal, she backs off.  I gain aggro on a Mammoth by snaring, swarming,
nuking, and it comes after me.  I kite it away only to notice that the
others are following it.  I tell them to take the other one, leave this
one for me.  They start killing the other one, I see the Shaman nuking,
and then meleeing (*sigh*).  One warrior goes down, and the Shaman who is
now on the top of the hate list runs for it. Mammoth following closely
behind.  The rogue and remaining warrior come over to help me kill the now
half dead mammoth, having gained substantial hate they just follow it from
behind as it chases me and it goes down.

The Shaman then announces that she does not see the mammoth anymore and is
coming back.  I tell her to be careful as she did not zone so is still on
the hate list.  *WHAM* you have been gored by a wooly mammoth. *WHAM*
again.  I run back and snare the beast, throw a swarm on it and annouce /g
found it.  The warrior and rogue come back over and again kill the stupid
thing. (as a side not, we, for some reason, did not get XP for either
kill [?]).

It could have gone worse, only one death, but it was good learning
experience.  We head back to the tower, the warrior comes and loots his
corpse.  I med as I now have 0 mana.  As I am medding I ask the tanks what
their Taunt is at, one tells me 0 as he never trained it (lvl 17) and the
other tells me his taunt IS 17.  I announce that MT is now the warrior
with 17 Taunt, and explain that little button defines his role in a group
for the rest of the game, and that it needs to be MAXXED.  I tell him that
when a mob comes back, he should be the first one to hit it, all the while
MASHING the taunt button.  I explain to the rogue that his place is behind
the mob, not in front of it, not on the side of it, but behind it.  He
understands fully (quick learner).  I tell them how to make /assist keys
and announce that they are now mandatory as enchanters will hate you later
on if you do not use them and it makes it easier to kill mobs when you all
concentrate on one of them.

I get FM and go to pull a Mob, I find a nice Mammoth (yellow to me) and
run back.  I pulled with Swarm, and as the mammoth came across the river,
I snared him and then kept running towards the tower, the mammoth comes
over the rise and it gets closer and closer and closer without anyone
engaging it.  I say "HIT IT!" and they start to, by that time though its
on top of me, and I get hit a few times.  I take a few steps back and
eventually hate is off me.  As the fight goes on i remind the warrior to
keep taunting, and tell the rogue to stay opposite the warrior.  They do
and the mob goes down.

Fast forward a few MoB kills.  I am medding up and the Shaman decides to
pull, no big deal.  I get to FM and I see inc, I look out and sure enough
its X2, same situation, full grown mammoths.  I announce the same thing,
Ill kite one away.  I throw a snare on one, swarm it, and nuke it, it
comes after me.  I run a good distance, /med let it get up to me, I run
back, re-snare and head to the group (who are killing the MoB pretty close
to perfectly, only gripe is Shaman still thinks she is a warrior.  I lay
on a few heals, see that swarm is off on the other mob, and then reswarm,
led it away, /med, snare.  Back to heal, mob dies as the other one is
coming back, and they take it down.  No deaths, MT is low on health, but
that is expected.  He managed to keep aggro 75% of the time (not bad
considering Taunt was only 17).  That is the way a multiple pull should be
handeled (well without an chanter mezz).

I feel good, I went to sleep with a smile on my face, and woke up with one
too.  I taught these players how a group actually works, instead of just
random slashing, spell casting, stabbing.  Dont get me wrong they have a
bit to work on, TAUNT!, shaman != pure melee (start a BST), and having
faith in the people you are grouped with.  A great night for me.

PS sorry for the length :)
