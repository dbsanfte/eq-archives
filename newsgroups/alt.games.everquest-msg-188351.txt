Bah...all 4 times I've gotten book alone (twice for my rogues, once for
somebody else, once to complete "robe-wearing-enchanter disguise")
I've always spent some time with the druid in Innothule and finished
out a Leatherfoot Raider's cap.  INSTANT gate to WC...get dropped off,
sneak upstairs (and if seen you can STILL run for it and try to grab) and
then BAMF! back to getting asked for SoW d00d at the WC ring.
