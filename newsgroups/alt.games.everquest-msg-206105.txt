Outdoors, it is probably a toss up between a ranger and a feigning
class, depending on the situation.  (Remember necros can also pull if
there are no other feigners...better to have the necro pull in the
Factory, for example, than any other non-feigning class).  You need to
take it situation by situation.

We like to play around in umbral planes were a well-played Ranger or
Druid is a far superior puller.  For example, you see a Raldukan on
track.  Camo up (invis).  Run *past* all the moktors to the Raldukan. 
(Monk/Paladin can't do that.  SK can).  Harmony everything around it. 
(Monk and SK can't do that, Paladin can)  Snare it.  (Monk/paladin
cant do that.  Sk can but may get summoned becase his snare does
damage)  Lead it back.  If you see a possible add in your way to camp,
harmony it as well...you have time because the Raldukan is snared. 
When you get near camp, stop and start jolting.  Presto!  Single
pulled with no aggro on the Ranger.

In outdoor or indoor zones, where you want to look for named pops. 
Advantage: Ranger or Druid.  In large, open zones where you will
possibly need to pull from and through lots of other KOS mobs that
dont see invis, advantage: Ranger.  (Anyone ever pulled the though
horror in ME?  Invis.  Snare it, run it to the edge of the zone while
harmonying anything you approach on the way.)  In any kind of zone
where you dont need invisible to scout things out, but will need to
pacify to single pull, advantage: Paladin and maybe Cleric.  In indoor
as well as outdoor zones where you are pulling from a simple camp,
where everything just pops predictably around you.  Advantage: SK/Monk
and maybe Necro

As a side note, about 15 minutes ago I got done playing around in
Plane of Torment.  There are mobs on a system of bridges that dip down
in the middle.  There are wandering mobs up above at the bridge
junctions.  In order to single pull you have to time it right so that
the wanderers are not near your pull.  Only way we could reliably find
to do that?  Bind sight.  Paladin (who BTW is able to pacify while the
ranger cannot harmony indoors) waited on me to pull because I was the
only melee able to bind sight...to take a look up above before
pulling.  This is an unusualy example though, and usually the lack of
harmony means someone else would be a better puller than the Ranger.

There are just a lot of different circumstances that will give
different classes an advantage when it comes to pulling.  Remember
that you may just want the highest level player, regardless of class,
because that player can single pull anything around.  Heck you may
want the enchanter to pull so that he or she can be sure to always mez
the target they want mezzed.  (Some like to mez the casters and drain
their mana first, for example)
