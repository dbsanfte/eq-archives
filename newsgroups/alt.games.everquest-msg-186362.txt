I always enjoy the stories of your efforts to group with idiots.  I got 
very lucky, and stumbled into some good people in my teens, and got into a 
guild of people of similar level, who I enjoyed playing with.  Eventually, 
that guild moved en masse to DAOC, but, fortunately, I had found a fair 
number of people in my current guild by then, so I moved over.  You really 
need to find a decent guild, if you want to get away from so much of that 
crap.  You might want to check into Wings of Valor, I have a friend with a 
few alts in that guild.  I have not asked him much about it, but, he does 
keep his alts in the guild, only reason he took his main out is that he was 
too high a level to participate with them, so he joined The Appointed with 
his main.  They have a website, but I don't recall it off hand.  I think 
they are listed on the emarr boards.
