"While we continue to work on the issues that have kept the EverQuest II
servers unavailable today, we wanted to let you know that in addition to the
experience and tradeskill debt wipes that were announced earlier, we will
also be offering free time to help make up for the time you're unable to
play. Exact details regarding time extensions will be available once we get
past our current problems.

This is a 24/7 effort on behalf of everyone involved. We will not rest until
all of EverQuest II is back up and running. We again apologize for the
inconvenience this has caused, and thank you all very much for your
understanding.

- The EverQuest II Team"
