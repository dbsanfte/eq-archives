OMG, that's horrible (no offense).

My 40 *Druid* has ~620 ac fully equipped but unbuffed ~660 self buffed.
(and no I'm not wearing crystal chitin or anything with major AC like that)

Note:  a good place to raise defense ~40 is Crystal Caverns, on the spiders
(Crystal Crawlers, Webmasters hit a bit harder, and spiderlings are
greentastic), they hit fairly softly.

Other day when I was solo root/rotting them, I accidentally pulled 2, got
them dying, get a 3rd for add, first 2 drop, number 3 at 75% health and I
run oom, I managed to tank it down to about 30% health before I had to run
(I died but it was ok because I got 3 defense off him)   And this is after
Regen, Skin like Diamond AND spikecoat all wore off mid combat, so I imagine
I can porcupine them if I keep the buffs up  (and throw in shield of spikes
too).

Granted, this is speaking from a druid perspective, not really sure how it
would apply to a cleric unless you bribe a druid to hit you up with thorns
and regen, Valor is approximately equivalent to Diamond, and you also have
Armor of Faith and Armor of Protection as well as Symbol, which should help
also, as well as steady use of Yaulp 2.  (Don't look at me if some of these
don't stack, I don't play a cleric, I just read the spdat, which doesn't
help with stacking issues)

Oh, and keep *cold* resist up, they proc Velium Poison (30pt dd + 120hp DoT
over 1 minute, cold based and immune to counteract poison (or disease) -
Haven't got Remove Curse yet to try it though)

Also, watch out for the dracnids down there, they proc Deadly Velium Poison,
600dmg over 2 minutes, also immune to counteract poison/disease, and resists
based off cold.

However, my defense is now at around 160 and 1hb (Dark Ember also  =) at a
piddly 68, blame my newbie levels with a scimitar, at least 1hs is 105.

Still confuses me when I get offense raises from being hit on with spikecoat
up  (~25 ac and 4pt dmg shield)
I get more offense raises from BEING hit than I do defense raises.    I
DON'T NEED FREAKING 187 OFFENSE!!

Hm. How much more can I ramble and get off topic? =P
