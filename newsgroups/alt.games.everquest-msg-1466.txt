My enchanter is a level 49 gnome.  Base (naked) stats are 85 CHA, errr, I
think 120 INT.   With all buffs and items I can get my CHA up to about 215
now *OR* I can get my INT up to about 185.   With buffs 'n' stuff I'm more
likely going to be 197 CHA and 175 INT.

About the lowest my CHA gets is about 135 (when I don't bother with the 40
CHA buff) which actually seems to be fine most of the time.

That said, I'll start answering your questions.

> What int and cha items can do into the primary hand?

At low levels when you're still meleeing, a knife with INT and a Stein of
Moggok or Crude Stein work great.  Or better yet, one of those 20 mana
totems (I forget what they're called...they go for about 10p) for the first
few levels are better than a Moggok.

> What's a good level of charisma for an enchanter that plans to spend  most
of his time mezzing and charming things?

Oh, aim for 120 up to about 16, then aim for 150.  After that just increase
when you can.

Like I said, mine is 49.  I think gnomes are the best, though they have
almost the worst starting stats.  Only DEs are worse, and Erudites have the
highest.

> I put my starting points such that my starting cha is 95 and int is 113,
> will that do?

*shrug* sure.  You won't have to worry quite as much about CHA as I do,
though CHA is easier to find than INT.  BY ACCIDENT I think I actually did
pretty well with my CHA at 85.

> How is it easier to powerlevel an enchanter with a shaman?

I still maintain that up to at least 30 druids are the best powerlevellers,
but anyone who can keep you alive (including rangers and pallies with
Greater Healing) can do a decent job for you through at least 16.

> Can tinkering bring at least enough profit to pay for itself?

No.

> Are there any useful quests I can do for the enchanter? I hate camping
for stuff

Stein of Moggok at 20 and the epic quests are the only ones I know. :)  I'm
sure there are numerous gnome quests in Ak'Anon though.
