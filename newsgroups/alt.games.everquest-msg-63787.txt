I have the condensed version of three of them that you can have for
free.

1. Kill lots of things that drop items that sell well to players or
vendors. Loot everything. Sell it all.

2. Engage in a trade skill where you can make something that sells for
more than the cost of the components. (e.g. some baking items that you
can make a couple silver profit on.) Start making and selling them until
carpal tunnel syndrome ends your playing days.

3. Go sit in EC or Faymart with a listing of "average" item costs for
things on your server. Buy low. Sell high. Rinse. Repeat.
