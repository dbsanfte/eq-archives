I recently started a Troll Shadow Knight and have gotten him to level
6. I have so far put all my practice points into 1hs and 2hs,
alternating for each level. I'm at a point now, though, where I think
the time it takes to level is long enough that I can keep my weapon
skills maxed without using my practice points. That being said, I'm
looking to get into a trade, but I'm not sure which trade to get into.
I don't think Tailoring is really an easy one to start with because of
the area that I am in. Not much in the way of silk or pelts in
Innothule swamp. Blacksmithing is kind of a pain because there is only
one forge in Grobb, and that is apparently for Troll only stuff, since
I can't even sharpen the rusty weapons I find in it. Cooking might be
a pretty good trade, but to be honest, I don't know if that's really
so much of a trade. What's the market like for baked goods? I've never
done pottery, so I really have no idea what's involved with that, or
what the potential for profit is.

I'm kind of leaning towards Blacksmithing, because I figure if I
really need to, I can go to Oggok and use their forges. Of course, I'm
guessing that I'll be moving out of Innothule swamp soon anyway (maybe
going to Nek forest), so I might find tailoring a little easier to
start with if I can get a good supply of pelts and silks. Of course, I
might decide to stay and hunt the Guk entrance.

What would your suggestions be for a Troll Shadow Knight?
