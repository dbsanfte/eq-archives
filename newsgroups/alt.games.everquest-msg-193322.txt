Much more then a MUD, not as manic as an MMORPG, Golden Age Avengers is a
character driven comic book campaign, set in 1930's New York. Ten sinister
cabals seek to control the city, battling each other along the way. Your
detective, an inhuman with evolving super powers, will solve cases to
prevent these crimes. Or, if you are so inclined, play the villain by
joining a cabal and accelerating their domination of the city. The game is
designed for a casual experience. Play even just a little and still see your
actions affect the greater campaign events to follow. Play solo or join
others online in the adventure.

The game runs in Internet Explorer. Nothing to download, no hardware to
upgrade. The action-turn nature of this browser game means you can break at
any time and set your own pace. Play anywhere you have the internet. Absorb
the material leisurely or take your lumps by clicking away.

Visit our website to play our first game for free, for a limited time only,
before the subscription service starts this Summer.

If you don't care for comic play, time-travel, fantasy and sci-fi games are
just around the corner. But we can always improve with some feedback on our
first title, Golden Age Avengers.
