Depends. Today I had a Mir group pull a 300pp/person split, and a
couple Tak adventures under 100.

I think one of the tak ones was under, as I suspect a blue diamond
may not have made it in (the split was under the running tally I had
going).

Othertimes, it depends on how quick the dungeon goes.  Did a Collect
in 35min, the split was around 60pp.  Who cares though...go back and
do another right away.
