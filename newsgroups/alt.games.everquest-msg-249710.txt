That's quite bizarre. I remember the reasoning they used when it was
first put in - necros could solo literally in their sleep by feigning
in a place where their pet would get aggroed by experience mobs it
could easily dispatch (the favorite being Lower Guk deadside tower).

Guess thats not necessary now with the way pets work. I find myself
preferring the old way though, somehow, bad pathing and all. Added
more spice.
