Hmm.. maybe I should organize an Everquest strike.

Microsoft really shouldn't allow programs to undermine the 'sanctity' of a
multitasking environment.

I got EQW but it's crashing.  I'll play around with it and see if I can
figure out why.  Is it working for anyone else after those last patches

I might just start playing Anarchy Online by principle since it seems to run
fine. (But it looked kinda goofy)...
