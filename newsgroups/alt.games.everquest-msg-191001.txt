After fighting [All The Nasties] in lower guk the other day I ran
to Oasis and saw a [Madman Across the Water].  Well, I ignored
him and got some experience doing the saltwater [Crocodile Rock]
and while I was there  I told someone [I've Seen the Saucers].  I
ran to E. Commonlands where the griffen looked like a [High
Flying Bird].  A druid ran by and used [Harmony] on the orcs.  I
remembered praying [Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me] last time I
ran through Kithicor, but the clock kept on [Ticking] and it was
almost [Curtains], but I was able to say [Someone Saved My Life
Tonight]

PD.
