Records of raid attendence don't start until you are a provisional member
of the guild

We have a policy of allowing people to go on inactive status, so
they do not lose ground while they are unable to attend raids.

1.  Attendence is figured on the last X raids (I can't recall what
X is off-hand.)  So you are never in a position of not being able
to achieve 60% raid attendence.

2.  You always gain RPP's - so you always gain by being in attendence

3.  How do you suppose the members in good-standing benefit from a
member who doesn't attend raids?  If they were allowed to take loot
that can improve members who do attend raids, the guild suffers.  

Ask Martin, Richard or James if people in their guilds who show up
for every other raid are as likely to be awarded loot.   
 
4.  We have a 30 day probationary period in which a senior guild member
spends a lot of time with a recruit.  In that time they make sure the
new member knows our policies - we do not assume they have read the readily
available posting on our site.

We are very upfront about our goals, and the steps we are taking to
achieve them.  This policy is part of achieving those goals, and
every recruit knows about it going in.
