I don't.  Or rather, I got tired of having my screen cluttered with
all the Journeyman This and Apprentice That and fiddled with /shownames
until I found the setting that turns off all the titles.

The old titles at least had some use, though I found a lot of them
somewhat annoying also because I couldn't remember what they meant.
Some were obvious (Assassin is some level of Rogue, Troubador's a
Bard, etc.), but Master? Archon? Oracle? Outrider? Hierophant?  I
eventually made a list -- sorted by title, not by class -- and keep
a printed copy near my computer so when I encounter a level 51+ and
need to know what class they were I can look it up.
