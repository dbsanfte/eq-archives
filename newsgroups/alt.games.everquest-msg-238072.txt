You mean 30% right?

Regardless, i don't see the validity of applying fuzzy logic. Fuzzy
logic only applies when there are semantics of "degree".

Even if life is 1% meaning 99% meaningless (assuming we have an idea
of whatever *that* means) it still has meaning. Fuzzy logic doesn't
add or detract to the debate.
