Once you get your Druid to 51 for Superior heal you should be able to handle
the Cavern Lotus in Fungus Grove. Just past the abandoned Village ther is a
spot with 3 Lotus none are close enough to agro while fighting. Decent exp
no cash but common drops of lotus parts (players paying 50p each to make
Lotus pie for POTC quest) Rare drops and I do mean rare drops include a vine
Necklace (10,000) and a vine whip (2500)
