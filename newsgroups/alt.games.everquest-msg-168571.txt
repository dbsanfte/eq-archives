I was responding to a particular post, not pontificating out of the
blue about abstract absolutes, where in hell do you get "only" from
that?  And there is nothing in that post nor in my later reply to you
implying that either of his "fun" or your "fun" is the result of "a
misplaced emphasis".  WTH are you getting so defensive about?

Spending hundreds of hours out of your life sitting in front of a
CRT (or LCD) display playing a video game strikes me as far more
silly than the trifle of how you split exp.  That you or David Pugh
would even care how anybody else splits their exp is beyond silly.
Is that why you're getting so defensive?  Because you subconsciously
comprehend how incredibly ridiculous it is for you to pass judgement
on how another player splits their exp, and it embarrasses you without
you being able to consciously understand why you're embarrassed?
