Hmmm, I wonder if maybe SWG is going to have the ability to chat between
servers.  They are capping the number of players on each server so you
may not be able to just create a char on your buddy's server to chat
with him.  They might have to allow folks there to cross server chat in
order to let their buddy on server A know its time to meet on server Q
where you both have chars.  Now if only they could find some way to test
this new sort of chat which surely requires its own server.  If they
could find someplace where they could get thousands of folks to log in
and use the feature it would let them test server capabilities before
releasing SWG.  If only..... <G>
