The output was changed, like, yesterday.
Now you only get an up or a down status.

VI's reason : People don't want to know the number of people logged on
just if the servers are up.

Rumored reason : To alow VI Customer support to blame server-wide
problems on user's ISPs. (I.e. "I can't connect" "Its you ISP" "So how
come there are only 5 people on at peak time" "eep" does not happen any
more)

HTH,

Jim
