Out of curiousity, where do you find these monks? The one's I'm currently
running into, even a level or two above me, have nowhere near the AC or HP I
do, and when a mob spends all it's time on them instead of me they become a
mana dump for the healers.  (And yes.... I play a monk, too. I've been on
both ends. Trust me, my monk is no substitute for a tank.)
  Of course, I'm perfectly willing to admit that if the warrior is a "first
character" and has only gotten up to bronze armor by lvl 30, and the monk is
an Ubertwink with the best Vellious stuff money can buy, then he'll probably
out tank. But on a level playing field........ no. I've done both and
there's simply nothing to support that even in the 20's and 30's.
