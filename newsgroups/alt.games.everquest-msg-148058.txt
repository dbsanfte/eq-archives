Yeah, I wouldn't say much ranting.... But it *is* TRULY a magnificent
whodunit mystery that unfolds.

I'd recommend getting a bowl of popcorn, a soda, and planning on spending an
hour or two to read on from page one to about page 10.  Page 8 is the
climax, but there's some worthwhile stuff in the next couple of pages that
wraps it up nicely.

Cheaper than renting a video for the evening. :-)
