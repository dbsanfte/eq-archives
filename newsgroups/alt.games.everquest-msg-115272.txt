Actually if you must know, natural 40AC bonus at 60, 12hp sitting regen,
infravision, good starting stats.  Please, your reaching.  Actually I do get
chaufferred around a lot, difference is I actually pay the druids and
wizards for their time.

Begging for gear, ya know we *might* have reached a point we agree on that
is similar to the druid sow/port situation.. I dont like to be begged for
free gear, I think I replied in another thread about possible begging
responses, check it out.

Sounds good, heed your own advice "..a warrior because it was easy", welcome
to the rank of iksar warriors, let me know how it goes.  And isnt the whole
"easy" line of thought been beat to death by people lambasting druids?
