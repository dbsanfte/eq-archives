Can you imagine the potential for dupe / plat loss bugs with code that
took coins from players to change looted coins and then redistribute. I
think that this would be a lot of nasty code.

In the end autosplit is only really an issue for a few levels.
The levels where you are fighting mobs that drop 1-5pp and "junk" loot.
(Usually the mid 20's I guess)
At other times mobs either drop :

1) No plat
2) more than 6pp
3) Loot that out weighs the loss of xpp considerably.

Also since this effect actually encourages socalising (Discussing loot
rules and having a master looter / banker etc.) and trust / reputation
VI are likely to leave it in as they see these things as good.

Imagine if they implemented a /raidautosplit which automatically gave
items looted on a rade to the most deserving member. Would that be a
good thing ?
