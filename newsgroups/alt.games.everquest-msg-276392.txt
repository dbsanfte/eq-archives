If you are looking at the door to SE, it is to the left of you, between
what looks like steam vents.  It is a small platform that extends out
toward a lava filled gap, and has a glowing green aura or something
floating over it.  Once you step onto that, you zone back into the
temple across from the bell to EL, and then you can walk on that one to
zone back.
