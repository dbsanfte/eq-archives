I really cant speak for others.. As a mage i use up a fair number of
DOTs.   I never carry less they 40 Mal, 40 Pearls, 40 Star Rubies, 40
Cats Eyes. However I also carry 40 Peri.   I do that since I do feel
clerics have a hard time.

As a Senior officer in my guild, on raids I take about 400 DOTS with
me.  Prior to the event we find the clerics and outfit them.  We also
outfit some lesser classes as well.

Somthing that may help your costs.. Work in the LDON that offers the
Group Temp Spell.  You go from using 6 DOTs to two then.

You will also find that if you sit in POK and Group cast (add 6 people
who dontate in) your profit will go up drasticly.

The good and the bad.. the Bad part.. use use DOTs.. the good part, no
one in the game is more hunted and sought after for groups.  It will
get better.. and trust me.. when you are 65.. people you first grouped
with will be in there 40s and 50s.

Somthing else that can help you feel like you have money. Head to
Crystal Caverns.  Find those terrible Orc Miners and battter them
until they drop those nice blocks of Veliumn we all love so much.
Should get between 50 and 100 for each.

Might even be able to get a few bucks doing a rez here and there.

Hope it helps.
