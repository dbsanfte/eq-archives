I believed in NBG when I started playing. However, I started realizing
that if I wasn't grouped with guildies/friends, often I was the only
one that felt this way. Of course, those that wanted to roll on
everything (those casters previously getting melee gear) changed their
tune when something dropped that _they_ needed.

I have two reasons for being non-NBG:

1. I don't trust people that I don't know
2. In a pickup group, it's really only "fair" to do NBG when everyone
has loot that drops in the area.

Everyone in the group is there as part of the group, so why shouldn't
everyone get a chance at drops?

Of course, all this can be solved if you discus how to handle loot
beforehand.
