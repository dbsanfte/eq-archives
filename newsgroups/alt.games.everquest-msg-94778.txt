On the basis that they sold SoL on the market without making sure that you
actually needed the crystal shard to port to Luclin, yes. If you think they
(a) know what they are doing, (b) have the ability to code what they want to
do properly  and (c) test it to make sure they got it right then just ask
yourself why yesterday's scheduled patch was followed (for the umpteenth
patch running) by an emergency patch today, and why after 3 years they still
don't have a fully functional sound engine.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not actually knocking them in any serious kind of
way, I just know from past experience that what may seem common sense to us
isn't always what you get with Verant.
