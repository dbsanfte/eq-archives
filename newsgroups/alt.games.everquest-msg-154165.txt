For the past several weeks, I've seen someone offering
boots of flowing slime at 90Kpp.  Even with others
offering them at 45Kpp.  He was always there, any time
I looked.  90K, never moved.  Past three days, he's gone.

Did he sell em?  I have no idea.  I think it probable that he
got an offer for a trade or a lesser amount of cash and made
a deal.... but I bet the deal was better than 45Kpp.

Now there's someone selling a pair for 70 Kpp.

====================================
Another phenomenum I've seen are vendor bought spells
going for sharp markups.  Spells that cost 5pp being
offered for 500pp, that sort of thing.  Not sure why,
some ideas:

Hoping someone will see a spell that isn't on the list
usually, and buy it for a friend.

Hoping someone will be buying from you and accidentally
click the wrong item.

Just a joke.

Trying to fill up the spells list in order to bury the one
they want to buy, until someone shows up with enough cash
to buy it.

Any other ideas?
