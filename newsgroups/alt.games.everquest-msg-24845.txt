I would say its 100% his own fault. Now you dont say where it was, but normally
this happen in NFP, that somone shout about the bag they lost.

1. How can anyone even make that mistake. Unless you have manually switched the
confirmation box off its ONLY money that can be dropped without you noticing.
So either people have been acting REALLY stupid, or been trying to find a spot
to drop items for an item transfer.
Still dont get why people would be stupid enough to drop items on the ground for
item transfers, everyone passing by can steal it. If you need to do an item
transfer, find a person to do it, either a guild buddy or a friend. If noone is
around you can also try to find a guild leader/officer. If someone is an
officer/leader of a guild, they will (hopefully) not steal your stuff. It will
probably mean being kicked out of the guild if your an officer, and a REALLY bad
rep no matter if its officer of leader who do it.
A lot of people in NFP use me as transfer dummy after doing a /guildstatus,
because they know they can trust me.

So stop dropping stuff on the ground, if you do its 100% your own fault.

Even worse, if peope find a bag and try to be friendly and find owner, people
try to lie to get the backpack. A friend of mine found a backpack behind Jades
in NFP and shouted out who dropped it. 12 people claimed it was theirs. Then he
asked them to tell what kind of backppack, and what was in it. 8 of them didnt
even get type of backpack rigth, and noone was able to name even 2 of the 10
items in the backpack.
So i dont really feel sorry for people who claim to have lost items any more,
since 12 out of 12 peopel tried to lie to get it back.


So if you hit one of the rare situations where you do actually drop a backpack,
due to all backpack slots filled, its of course too bad, but im convinced 99% of
all people you see bitching about stolen backpacks/stuff is either lying to get
eventual backpacks found nearby, lying to get symphaty and items/money, or have
been stupid enought to drop the items of their own free will.
