I can't stand this absurdly simple concept of only good or evil. If
indeed it would be that simple than I'm sure there would be scores of
good rp games out. But the fact is it isn't that simple. And I do like
it this way.

For example...born as a dark elf but are contempt for weaker beings?
Well, bad luck for you. You can't step down because you're supposed to
be evil. You must slay them. Yeah, thanks...

Happened just yesterday on my iksar necromancer. I was in Cabilis
minding my own business when a group of "good" adventurers entered it
invisible. I just thought about what to do. I can't attack them, can't
yell for guards or anything. So in the end I just hailed them and warned
them not to let themselfes be caught by my people. Roleplay? Hardly. :/
Oh in case you wondered what they were doing in Cabilis...probably
hunting the enchanter epic mob.

>> Balance the good and evil.

The point is there is no such thing as good *or* evil!
