Probably not. With that much difference, warriors are likely to hit for
minimal damage, and be hit often for maximal damage. Necro is going to
have a hard time getting a spell to stick on the rook. Necro pet is going
to be nearly useless. The cleric will spend all his time healing the
warriors until he gets agro, then he'll die in a messy chicken attack.
But that's just my prediction....

Wildly unreliable advice for those less than level 40...

(1) Don't fight anything more than 6 levels higher than you. Ever. Your
spells won't land, your melees won't hit, your tanks will get plastered
for max damage at each hit, your healers can't heal fast enough. The only
ones to survive will be the ones who flee the zone.

(2) I wouldn't suggest pulling reds regularly unless I had 4-6 people
in the group. Otherwise you'll have too much downtime and deaths to
make it a useful camp.

(3) If you're only fighting whites and yellows, probably 2-3 is enough.

(Other Stuff) Casters are always underconned, pretend they're a few levels
levels higher than they really are or avoid them completely. Pets may or
may not count as equivalent level PCs. Twinks and/or highly skilled players
can help you kill more dangerous stuff than usual. You can often do better
in terms of xp/time by taking out hoards of blue mobs than you can by
taking out fewer numbers of yellow and red mobs.

All this is assuming you're in a standard "pull a mob, kill it while it
dishes out damage on you, heal up, repeat" mode. All bets are off otherwise.

Three minutes of thought from an experienced EQ player is all it will take
to think of mobs and groups for which *none* of the above advice is useful.
Hope it helps.
