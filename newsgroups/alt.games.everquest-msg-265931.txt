I'm not sure how a quest would be time consuming if there weren't 'rare 
drops' or 'rare pops'.

If you are re-imagining the entire quest system, great, because it 
currently blows, but if you transplanted the existing quest system in 
your triggered spawn world you'd trivialize the quests.

Everytime I turn around there's a level 67 beast lord killing the 
goblins for a blackened alloy medallion for a friend. Or 70th level 
Monks slaughtering sarnaks wholesale to 'speed up the pop' of the rare 
revenants for a 12th level necro, and maybe grab the piece for the key 
to HS while they're at it.

Its not just the 'zerg' its the midlevel one group content that would be 
a challenge for one group rarely gets engaged that way. Instead the 
group goes and grinds xp in the fastest place possible, and when they 
want that item from one group mid level content they send in a couple 
70th levels to go get it for them.

That's not 'baseless paranoia' that's 'standard operating procedure'.

Your missing the point. When a guild can take twice as many people as it 
'should need' due to gear AA and win its not trivializing conent 
(although it is poor encounter design). Its when an encounter was 
designed for 6 55th level players, and its engaged by one 55th who needs 
the drop, and 2 70ths who kill it without breaking a sweat.

The 55th is not challenged by such an encounter, or indeed, any 
encounter prior to that, as long as his 70th level buddies are online.

There -should- be things that a 45-50 can be challenged by, and must 
overcome on their own. Right now with the vast majority of encounters if 
your 45-50th level group is having trouble overcoming the encounter, and 
you really want the drop, you just go get your 70th level buddies to do 
it. That trivializes the content. Instancing -prevents- your 70th level 
buddies from holding your hand everytime you run into somehting that is 
not a cakewalk.

The only things in EQ that your 70th level buddies can't trivialize are 
instanced content (ldon's), and the two dragon raids. And even on both 
of those, the devs have to assume that your 50th level group is going to 
have virtue and kei and other 60+ buffs. And for nagafen, the 70ths are 
on hand to clear out -everything- but the dragon.
