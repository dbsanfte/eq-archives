Quite deservingly this thread has been moved to the classics forum. 
Unfortuntely this means that you cannot post to it anymore.  It is
still well worth a read though IMHO. I've read quite a few roleplaying
threads based on EQ - this is definately one of the funnier ones. 
Some good contributions from everybody who posted - brilliant!

Now this is a thread for females only so scoot all you men � we will
only be talking about babies and women's problems�.. Don't slam the
doo�

Hehe � works every time. Now girls � just sit round the fire and make
yourself comfortable � muffins are on the table and toasting forks in
the grate. Is the kettle boiling yet? One of you young wizards give it
a little assist please � that's right. Now are we all cozy? Good.

I asked all you girls around because I have seen so many broken hearts
in EQ and I thought I would share a few of my experiences with you and
maybe save you from some of the mistakes I made. Ohhh, this tea is so
nice, now where to begin�

Oh yes � the Bards. Never trust a Bard with your heart girls, I had a
real charmer after me once � ohh he was so handsome and he looked just
magnificent in his armour. He was a real cutie pie and he had such
good manners, clean finger nails too. He gave me flowers and
chocolate. But the best thing was his voice, ohhh could he croon. He
came to my house one night when the moon was full and sang his heart
out right under my window � just like Romeo and Juliet it was. It was
so dreamy and romantic � how was a poor girl to resist? He climbed up
the Ivy and pressed his suit � ironed his armour? No you silly girl
that's not what I meant! Well, do I need to paint a picture? But, ten
minutes later I hear clinking as he puts his armour back on, then a
quick sello and phoooom he is scorching the grass as he scoots off
into the distance � and I have never seen him since. No girls, never
trust a Bard.
