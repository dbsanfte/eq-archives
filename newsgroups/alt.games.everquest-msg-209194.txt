We did it about 2 weeks ago with 9 people and it was disgustingly
easy. No crowd control, no kiting, just powering through the mobs. It
would've been trivial with just the 6 highest lvls there (65 bard, SK,
necro; 64 cleric, shaman, druid). Two groups around lvl 60 should be
able to do it with ease. 

The only real trick is to have someone that can take the hits stand
close to the dwarf so he doesn't get beat on in the intial rush. After
I landed slow, tanking 3 of them while they killed the rest was easy.
Mobs that hit for 200 just aren't scary any more <g>. 

Rgds, Frank
