BULLSHIT.

I've seen about half-a-dozen folks here whine about getting /tells for
assistance.  On the other hand I've long since given up trying to get
assistance in game with /ooc, /shout, or /auc.  Why?  Perhaps because
you can go quite literally for hours without a reponse to public
channel requests, while it is rare for a /tell to be ignored or
refused.  For every one of you "it's common courtesy..." whiners here
there are scores of players on every server I've been on (eight or nine
of them so far) in-game who seem to respond ONLY to a polite /tell.

So, just in case I'm not clear here, let me repeat:

The claim that /tell is less courteous than public channel requests
is a load of meaningless BULLSHIT.  Public channel requests are so
nearly useless they are not worthy of the comparison.
