I agree, that is wrong and pure greed. I would likely put such druids (or wizards at the
wizard spires) on my "Do everything short of deliberately training Vox on them" list. At
the minimum, they would go on my cleric's "Cross three zones to laugh over their corpse
until it rots as they beg and plead for a rez" list.

I have a flat rate: 10pp to any place I can port, sow included, and I have been known to
help out people in need with a stern warning to "do something at least as nice for
someone else in need." But then, there are so many other, easier (IMO) ways to make
money. Rosewhite has made enough cash by selling imbued Vale studded armor (what Karana
worshipping ranger, paladin or druid would NOT want a 6 AC cloak with 3 STA and 2 WIS?
That will be 250pp, please, and would you like these lovely matching boots with 6 AC, 2
STA and 2 WIS for only 250pp more?) to power level my 16th level enchanter, Tvon,
through electrum jewelry;  so now he's making a nice pile of cash. No fuss, no bother...
and no gouging people on a corpse run, either.
