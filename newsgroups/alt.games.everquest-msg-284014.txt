Yup - it's a good plan, and it reassures the tank whilst also stopping
the casters' getting frisky with big nukes ;)  

I know it's because the casters' want to be seen pulling their weight,
but I'd rather they didn't, really. Dots or smallish nukes are best,
and even they are better held back until the mob is under 70%.  It's
just not worth the casters' launching a big nuke at the start of a
fight, because the tank loses aggro, the caster gets the tar whaled
out of him/her, and the tank sometimes has a heck of a job getting
aggro back.  The times I've seen this happen...
