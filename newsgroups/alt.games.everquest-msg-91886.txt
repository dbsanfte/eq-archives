No, I'd say going into a dangerous area of Qeynos without getting
bound there first is what caused the problem. Even if it hadn't been
for the patch, you wouldn't have likely been able to get back in and
get to the corpse in time. It sometimes takes over 30 minutes on a
single trip from Erudin to Qeynos, counting time waiting for the boat
at the dock.

If you displayed this sort of attitude at any point in your
conversation with the GM, it's no wonder you didn't get any lenience
whatsoever.
