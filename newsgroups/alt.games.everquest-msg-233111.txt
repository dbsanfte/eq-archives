I was told by a GM in General Chat that you can escalate the issue
with your server GM (not a "Guide") for in-game assistance to receive
the item.  I'm guessing the GM can just hand a satchel to your toon in
person.

I petitioned to have this done, but so far, I haven't received a
response from any GM on The Tribunal yet (possibly due to my off-hours
play times), and I'm assuming this will take some time as these are
done on an individual basis.  Since patch day is only in a couple of
weeks, it might be just as effective to wait until the /claim feature
is fixed.
