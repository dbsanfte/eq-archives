I can't conclusively that it's the trees that cause it, but I have
much, much slower framerates in Warsilk Woods, Swamp of No Hope,
Wakening Lands, and Plane of Growth than I do in zones without all the
trees.  Oddly enough, I don't have problems in other tree-heavy zones
such as Emerald Jungle and Trakanon's Teeth.  I have futzed with all
display settings, cranked clipping plane down until I can't see my own
feet, and I still get it.  It isn't that bad if I've got Selos Song of
Travel, and am levitating well over the tops of the trees, or if I'm
in 3rd person view, and zoomed WAY out, but anything that requires me
to look at the leaves makes it almost impossible to move.  If I'm with
a group hunting there, I will normally sit back with the
finger-wigglers and start stacking bard DoTs, because I can do that
looking at the ground.  I've got some very nice weapons, but I can't
do 160hp/tick when I'm lagging so bad I can't target the smelly
critter.
