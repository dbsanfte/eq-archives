    Or the person was a bit clueless and didn't see the skeleton pet, you,
etc. I was once soloing on my necromancer in Dawnshroud, and as I pulled to
my pull spot I noticed someone run up to my mob (mine because it was
Darknessed and following me) and cast slow on it. I cast two more DoTs on
it, tapped it once, and the XP was mine when it died. The shaman immediately
starts screaming at me in tells for touching his mob, how I have no idea
what a world of hurt I have coming to me, etc. I countered with, "Did you
not find it odd that when you pulled with slow the mob started WALKING
towards you, and not running? Didn't that tell you it had already been
snared BY SOMEONE ELSE?" That only made him rant more about how I was
doomed, how I'd never get in a good guild, his main would see to that, blah
blah blah. Some people are just morons.
