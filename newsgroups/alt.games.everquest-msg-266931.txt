Hi all,

I'm a wood elf on the starting island in EQII.  Someone gave me an axe
but I can't seem to arm my character with it.  I know I possess the
axe because I have the option of selling or repairing it when I talk
to the appropriate NPC's.  But it doesn't show up on my inventory
screen, which does contain some empty slots.  I've had to fight many a
monster with my bare hands.  You can imagine how successful I am (I
can't even kill a deer to fulfill a quest).

Thanks for any and all help.

D
