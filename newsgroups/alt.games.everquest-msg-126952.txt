On Xev a bunch of ones similar to what you mentioned did, in fact,
evolve very quickly.

There's an /auction channel for trading.
Not sure about the other classes, but all of the servers now have a
/wizard channel. (Need to check on Graffe's to see the password for your
server)

There's others, but I don't look at them much, if at all, so I'm not
sure of the names.
