It was always my understanding that at less than Lvl 20, you were restricted
to grouping within 5 levels of your own, then after 20 you get experience at
1.5 times your level.  That has 20's able to group with up to 30, 30's with
45's, and 40's get xp grouped with up to 60's.  I know it works with up to
Level 35 from doing it, any Level 40's able to confirm?
