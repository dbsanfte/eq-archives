    That may make ogres a preferred race, but that alone doesn't make a
dwarf non-competitive with a barbarian or a troll. Frankly, our guild has
one ogre period out of 130+ characters, and he's been on leave for a
looooong time. And we do just fine.

    You're a level 60 warrior, and you're in a raiding guild. Take a look at
that Fierce Heraldic list if you would, and list for us how many pieces
you'd wear over what you have on now and how many HPs you'd gain from doing
that. I think you'll find people react much more to that than to something
that isn't as tangible. Wasn't it mid-Kunark or later when people finally
noticed the "can't be stunned" advantage that had been in game since
release?
