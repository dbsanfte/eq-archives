I did not say 2 hours, I said a few, I'd have to check /played to know 
exactly.  I was not buffed at all, other than self buffs, and once or 
twice, level appropriate buffs from others.I was not power leveled at all.  
I soloed the whole time, except for one brief period, maybe 20 minutes 
total.  Before I did the /testbuff, I had 3 pieces of newbie gnome caster 
armor, 3 or 4 pieces of the sensate armor that drops off the shrooms in 
paludal, and one or two pieces of small cloth armor.  I still had my newbie 
food and water, and I had about 40% of my spells purchased.  The trick was 
to bind in a convenient spot, don't worry at all about death, it's 
meaningless anyway until level 10.

This was the second character I leveled to 10 or higher after the changes 
to make those levels trivial, the other 10 or so characters that made it 
past level 10 were all done under the old rules, and did take quite 
noticably longer, despite being mildly twinked.
