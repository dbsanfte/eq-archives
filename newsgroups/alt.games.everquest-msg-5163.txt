Well, if having 2401 people on the server wasn't enough of a problem.
It bites the dust 3 minutes after I log on. I am afraid that it might
be load related. It seems to be the same few servers. Of course, since
they don't bother to give any information, maybe its the ISP for those
specific servers. The game is difficult to enjoy when there are 2200+
people on when you get there. Finding a live mob should give exp
itself.
