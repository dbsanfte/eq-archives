I know it's a stupid question, but that has never stopped me
before.....

I recently upgraded to a new PC and when I was reloading all my
software, I realized that I had somehow lost disc 3 of EverQuest
Evolution.  I have disc 1 and disc 2, but now disc 3.  I even tried to
install it with the first two discs hopping that it would allow me to
unload the needed files via a patch.  No dice.

Is Sony in the practice of selling individual discs or am I going to
have to just buy another copy of the game?  I noticed the Target has
EverQuest:Evolution for $19.99 so it would be too much of a waste to
purchase it again.  Seems a shame though when I only need the last
disc.

Any advice?
