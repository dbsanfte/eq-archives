I've done exactly this and been attacked by stuff that shouldn't see through
invis.  I've have it happen MORE than once.

The bard invis song does the same thing, though I haven't really tested that
one (I just try to avoid bards who are singing it while I'm running to a
camp).

But, I've forgotten to /bug it. :(

Since I've been away from AGE for a while & no doubt forgotten, I'll post my
char info.  Not at all to brag ('cause the amount of time I play is rather
quite pathetic...I really need to get a life) but just so you know that I
know about the game.

60 enc, about 100 days played
53 dru, about 120 days
52 wiz, about 45 days
48 mage, about 50 days
