No I don't when the tag is sewn on the outside of my garment or jewelry.
Most are not that visible without getting in someone's face to inspect it.

Obviously enough people are concerned about this and that to me is ok. Like
I said I can agree with your right to inspect others. You should be able to
agree with other desire's to not allow you to inspect them. It is courtesy
and I would hope you could understand that. If not then like I have always
said. It can tell a lot about that the person.
