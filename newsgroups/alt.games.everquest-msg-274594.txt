That jives with my numbers. I noted a character I wasn't ldoning much 
with went from around 1000th place in lguk to around 700th without doing 
any dungeons. Indicating that around 30% fewer players who had done more 
than a dozen lguks were in the game.

And these 30%/35% drop rates don't account for the number of dormant 
accounts. Those that are prepaid 6 months or a year but for which the 
player isn't logging in any more... or even those on monthly that the 
dormant player just hasn't had the surety of itent to actually cancel 
yet.

Bazaar and PoK population numbers are down around 50%, in my estimation. 
Suggesting an increase in dormant active accounts as high as 15-20%.
