I can't tell you the number of times my Cleric has been stiffed on rezzes,
"I'll pay you 200pp for a rez, plz!"
Then after getting rezzed - and healed - the fool waves bye and runs off.
Oh well.

It still doesn't compare to the idiot who asks for a rez FROM 3 OR 4 ZONES
AWAY!!!  Like what - it's my job to run all around hell's half-acre rezzing
your ass?

Sheesh - try looking in the zone you died in.
