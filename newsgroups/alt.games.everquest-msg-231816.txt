From the shadows, the mysterious Knight37 <knight37m@email.com> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>Subject says it all really. Just need a place to kill some stuff.

Paludal will get you two more levels before going bad. The company
leaves something to be desired, though.

Highkeep is exceptional at that level all the way up to 34, but it has
to be uncrowded, and for highkeep that means two groups maximum in
basement.

I believe by that level you can kill in Dawnshroud. Outdoor zones tend
to be rather poor exp, though.

Lake of Ill Omen is still an option - you could do sarnak fort solo.
Again, though, exp would not be terribly fast.

South Karana, at the spires or possibly at the chicken town, would be
good.

With a full group, or some heavy twinkage, you could handle Splitpaw.

There's always LDoN if you can stand the company.

Marus Seru would give you slow but easy experience.

Solusek A would be 'okay'. The experience there is good for a group,
but you'd have to bring your own.

Stormbrunt maybe? I forget what level it starts at.

If you have a fat manapool you might be able to start in iceclad.
Again, outdoor zone, poor experience.

There may be others, those were just off the top of my head.
