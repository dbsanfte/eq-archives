What follows doesn't slow you down unless you CHOOSE to allow it to,
either. If someone starts sending tells asking to buy your equipment,
ignore it and keep going. Once again, the wasting of your time is your
own damn fault here...

I dunno, because Verant doesn't feel like giving into the whiney,
