The entire Tash line has no resist check, Mala and Malo(s) have no resist
check, OOS/HOS has no resist check.  All others do even though the names
can be stupidly confusing.

OOS is a tiny debuff and only used because it is unresistable and every
little bit of debuffing counts.  Malosinia which Shaman and Mages get at 63
is a much better debuff but checks vs magic so can get resisted hence the
value of the spells mentioned above.
