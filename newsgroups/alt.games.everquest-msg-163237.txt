I recall a fight against a Killer Shark (long time ago) in Erud's
Crossing, where it went sorta like Jazz describes.  The Ranger I
was partnered with appeared to be able to nuke from out of the
water, while neither of us could hit with melee or spells while
in the water.  Since we couldn't kill it with just the Ranger's
spells we ended up camping to clear agro (obviously not an option
with a mob that summons).  Anyhow, my point is that sometimes
combat vs. underwater mobs is bizarrely bugged, and there doesn't
seem to be much you can do about it except clear agro and try
again.
