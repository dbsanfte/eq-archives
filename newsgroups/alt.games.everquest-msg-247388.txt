Just to clarify my position, I'm not suggesting this is a good idea for the
game. I should have put "obvious commercial solution" in quotes because I
said it somewhat sarcastically.

But it wouldn't surprise me at all to learn that they've done the analysis
you've suggested and have come to the conclusion that rather than wasting
resources trying to prevent what they can't stop, it's better to just go
with the flow and in fact, start profiting from it. Like alt-tabbing and
ShowEQ, the first step is that they stop trying to prevent it. Saves them
resources by not having to track abusers, not having to deal with complaints
about players who abuse, not having to code or maintain the code preventing
alt-tabbing, etc. Definitely reduces costs to drop a "feature" that isn't
bringing them any *direct* revenue. But if they can then take the next step
and figure out how to actually monetize the activity, well, that's going to
get serious internal attention, particularly from the guys in the company
who are currently holding sway in SOE politics, i.e., the same ones who
figured out how to make the very un-fun and low-integrity SWG a very
profitable business.

From a business standpoint, it's not clear to me that they would lose net
revenues. Sure, they'd lose a lot of the folks from this forum who believe
that such a move would compromise the game, but Yantis's empire is growing
daily for a reason: all indications are that there's a big market consisting
of players who are willing to translate their RL $$ into game currency.
They've tried to stomp it out, but it hasn't worked and in fact Yantis and
his army of guild leader/farmers keep getting richer and he keeps buying up
the competition. I can easily imagine some internal SOE marketing guy
arguing that they're leaving money on the table.

And yes, I'm aware of the counter arguments regarding the integrity and
credibility of the game among the audience of power players whose influence
is key to the game's success, and the potential cost of losing this
audience. I'm not taking the position that it's slam dunk in either
direction, but I can see the business case and if they go forward with this,
it's probably because they have better data than you or I to form their
forecasts.
