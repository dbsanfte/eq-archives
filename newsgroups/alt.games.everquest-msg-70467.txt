No, all of your in game deaths were your fault. If you died, you were in
the wrong place at the wrong time, not being alert enough, etc. Blaming
others (or even more rediculously, their gear) for your deaths puts you
firmly in the "would you like some cheese with that?" camp.

However, in the converse, if the person is *not* fun to play with or a
poor player (assuming that they have gear you have "judged" as being
twink gear) then the assumption is that it's because they are a twink.
Not because they just might be an asshole, or a poor player no matter
what they were wearing. It must be the fault of the twink gear, eh? Your
logic is astounding.

What level is your main again? Just curious. And yes, it *will* be hard
to resist, and if you're like 99% of the players, you will twink them,
at least moderately, to give them a leg up through the same old "rats
and bats" zones that you've already fought your way through to earn
coppers rather than plat.

'Everybody complains about twinking until they're able to do it.'
