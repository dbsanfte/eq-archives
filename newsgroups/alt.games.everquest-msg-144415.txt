I've seen adds pull off the puller and onto me from only
the clicky legs.  So they do generate hate.  But thats the
only mobs that have ever cared about the legs; ones
that are only along to help out, and have never been
taunted mezed rooted nuked or seen a real heal done
on someone they hate... if they have anything else
to think about then legs heal just doesn't add up to
enough to come play with me instead.

I used to (and still occaisionally do) literally stand there
clicking leg heal through entire fights, with six mob pulls
standing around mezed while we took down their
buddies one at a time.  Heal rate from click heal adds
up to a pretty hefty regen or HOT if you look at it
that way... at any rate, you'd think that with me pouring
out literally thousands of HP per minute I'd be waaaay
up on the hate list of that last mob when mez broke,
but its still the chanter he goes for.
