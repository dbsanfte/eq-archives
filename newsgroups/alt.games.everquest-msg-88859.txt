So have you figured out why you go LD so often?  Rather than trying to
get VI to change something they won't change, I'd work on changing what
you can,  your connection.  If you are unable to do something to work 
out the issue you may find that on line gaming is not for you, since a
stable connection is vital.  Do you know what the issue is?  Please post
details of what you know regarding the issue and perhaps folks here can
make suggestions to help, but failing that LAN/single player games might
be a better option for you.

th
ps I don't care how many times you die a week, setting up such an
exploit as you suggest isn't worth it, except to the exploiters.
