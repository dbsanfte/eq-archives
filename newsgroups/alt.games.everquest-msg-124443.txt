    Yup, as they did make ominous noises on our server message board as soon
as Bennea got her epic and moved out. But some members of my guild, me
included, posted very pleasant messages about how happy we were with the new
system and how willing we were to help the people there. Suddenly the
mid-level guild got a clue as to what that really meant (like when the US
puts an aircraft carrier battle group off a rogue country's shores for
"training exercises"), and they started helping along with everyone else. It
really is cool now - when Ragefire pops you have people from all different
guilds coming to help the cleric whose time it is to get the drop, guilds
that previously would have been at each others' throats. It'll only take one
stupid guild to mess this up, but so far nobody has been that stupid.
Helping others achieve their goals before your own - that's what's made the
cleric epic a true cleric item on our server.

    One idea I've seen was putting the last piece on a mob like the Hand of
Veeshan, in Sky. No casual campers there. =)
