Thanks Jacobson,

    Both computers are running XP and the firmware is 1.42 (the latest one).
At this time Comcast asks you not to put anything in the Host Name and
Domain Name as they are dynamic.  I can find the domain name easily enough
and will try to put that in, but the host name is now whatever you named
your computer (i.e. computerone, or bob, etc).  Will try tonight.  Thanks.

HC
