Put the shouter on your Ignore list or turn off your Shout. Either way kills the
problem, but if you do the second you might miss warnings like "Grif headed to
Inn2" as you are sitting right in front of it! Oh, you could also change the colour
of the text for something hitting you...but shouts are still annoying regardless. I
just ignore 'em.
