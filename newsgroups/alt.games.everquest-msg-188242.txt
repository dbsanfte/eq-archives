Sometime late last year, one of patches gave paladins healing abilities or
increased their existing ones. I have heard that a level 60 paladin has
healing abilities comparable to a druid.  Having the ability to tank and
heal could be part of the reason in the renewed interest in them.  However I
have never played a pally so I may totally off base.

Good hunting!
