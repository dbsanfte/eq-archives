Doh no they are not and that wasn't the point, as for even being competition
to Sony in the console market the jury is out.

As for simple concept's well I would imagin most would see it your way as
well, the problem with that is it's not going to help MS or X-Box to have
CoN any more than it would having Super Mario on it in the big picture.

The most it would do is make more money for Sony, in fact by not putting CoN
out for X-Box is probably going to help MS & X-Box because most who will
want to play CoN will probably end up buying another game in it's place
which MS does have the rights to profit shares or even their own for in
spite of not being able to buy CoN and the fact most won't want or have the
coins to shell out for a PS2 & CoN.

How's that for simple Dark Nerf Thief lol
