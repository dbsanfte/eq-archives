I'll try to make this quick....
I'm in SK fighting 2 aviaks, 1 dies, then pet and I finish off the other,
but pet dies right near the end.
I'm too low on mana to make another pet, so I invis and med.  When I'm
almost FM, I get attacked by a lion?  WTF?  They can't see invis!  Then I
hear a skellie cackling and attacking it.  No other necro around, so I do
/pet guard me and it acknowledges my command.

I didn't make this pet!  Where the Hell did it come from?  I'm positive my
1st one died, and this one had a different name.
Anyone seen anything like this before?
