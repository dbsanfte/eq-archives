Depends on what you mean by expansions.   If the expansions are in name
only, but really just putting the phat lewts on a CD and selling them, no.
EQ style expansions I don't have a problem with, as you're not really buying
items, you're buying actual expansions with new content.   Lands, monsters,
encounters, quests.  And even releasing twice a year, that content has been
used by the time the new one is released.

No, I don't think I would.  But then I never tried MTG, so I don't have real
experience with it.

Yes.    I wouldn't pay the fee, but I don't have a problem with them
offering it as they do.  A higher level of customer service does not effect
how the basic game is played.   And all of the effects that it does have,
extra loot from Legends only zones or more common GM events (does Legends
actually have GM events beyond  the ones they had during the first couple of
months?) are mitigated by segregating the players onto a separate server.

As long as the game is not designed around the idea that everyone must be
playing two characters at once.

If you wouldn't, then you better stop playing games alltogether.

Lets them charge you less?   Thats the funniest thing I've read here in a
while.

Of course its a personal choice.   And I never said my tastes in the matter
were universal.  Obviously they aren't, or IGE would already be out of
business from lack of customers.   But I stand by my opinion.  There is
nothing more harmful that Sony could do to thier game.  If the game is set
up with the expectation that you will be buying your equipment and levels,
then it's not very much of a game.

It also encourages them to take one of thier biggest problems with the game,
camping... and instead of working to fix it, to find ways to make the
problem worse.  Because if they can make it bad enough, they make more
money.    Would we have Travellers boots purchasable from a merchant, and
improved Run Speed AA available just for leveling, if journeyman boots were
worth $50 a pop from SOE?   I don't think so.  (One of the original
ultra-camps, if you remember the days they dropped in Najena)

I can see it now.   A SOE suit calling a designer / programmer into thier
office.   'Whats this I hear about you wanting to make Ragefire a *spawned*
encounter in Skyfire?   Are you mad?!  Don't you realize people are paying
us $74.99 per heart to avoid two week camps of clearing fire giants and
organizing twink Nagafen raids?!   If we "fixed" your "problem," where would
we make up that revenue stream?'

Exadurated...  perhaps.  But I dont' have a whole lot of faith in SOE where
chasing the almighty dollar is involved.
