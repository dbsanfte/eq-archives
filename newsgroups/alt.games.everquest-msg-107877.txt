I never spent much time in LoIO with my druid, so I don't know how bad
it is, but I tend to take more crap in N. Karana than any other zone
in the game.  I even had one guy DEMAND I powerlevel him, and when I
politely said no, to told me that he was going to get his level 60
Necro and KS me everywhere I go.  Oddly enough, that never actually
happened.
