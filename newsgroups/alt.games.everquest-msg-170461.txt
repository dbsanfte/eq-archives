First off there are some websites which you will want to take a look at:

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/ For information on quests, items, monsters
and loads of other in game stuff.
http://www.eqatlas.com/ For maps of almost every zone in the game.
http://eq.crgaming.com/menu/monk.asp For information on the monk class as
well as loads of other information on the site

I have never actually played a monk in EQ but one thing I have learned about
monks is: ask your group members to turn off loot-autosplit. Monks don't
like gathering lots of cash as the added weight reduces their abilities.
