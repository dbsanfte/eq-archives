I was pre-qualified fir beta on EQ2.  Real life circumstances cut me off
from the internet entirely in March of this year, and the Email I had listed
with EQ is gone.  Just today got my system back on and am trying to learn
what status the beta testers are at, and trying to figure out where I am.

Qualified by purchasing Lords of Everquest.  Saw a note that they would be
resending info.  have updated all my info at EQ accounting,,,

So has it started?  EQ2?

Just got back on today - what is the status of EQ2?
