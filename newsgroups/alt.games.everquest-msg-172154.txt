If you are getting frustrated take a break and try again in a few days.  I
still have to do that sometimes.  There are just times when things don't go
your way in the game and it is more pain than pleasure playing it.

If you are having that much trouble with the newbie armor quests I would
forget about them and just work on levelling.  By the time you hit 20th
level you will have outgrown that armor anyway and will be making enough pp
just by playing to afford something better.
