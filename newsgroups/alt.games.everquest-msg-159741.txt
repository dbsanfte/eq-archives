}Actually, with the new AA abilities available, you can take all of your
}tradeskills up to 250 now.

My reading of the new AA suggests that you can only get 3 levels of tanaan 
crafting thingy, so you can only get 4 general tradeskills to 250 (ie, 
almost all, not all :) ).  At a cost of 9 AA points total.  Am I missing a 
trick?
