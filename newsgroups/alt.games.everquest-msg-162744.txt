Necro pets are still extremely powerful, but relativley they were even more
powerful back then.  (they've been nerfed a few times, and other classes
have been upgraded).  Necro pets could solo blue mobs without the
necromancer helping at all.

So, the Necro moves into an exp spot where the mobs are blue to him.  Lower
Guk was a popular one.

/pet guard here

Necro casts feign death.

Necro goes afk, comes back a couple hours later, and sees how many levels he
gained from his pet killing the mobs that wandered past.  Even if the pet
did lose, the necro would still be perfectly safe, since he had feigned
death the entire time.

If invis was being used in a similar manner (not sure if it was, I don't
remember it ever not poofing pets) it would work the same way.   You would
just have to refresh it every so often.   Your pet kills mobs that never
even know you are there, so it's risk free.
