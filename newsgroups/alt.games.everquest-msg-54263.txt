I'm hunting crocs in Oasis today and sees Dirtius (something or other).  He
looked like a typical desert madman, only he was wielding twin rapiers.  Was
a rogue model because he could backstab and hide/sneak.

When I got there, the team was already chasing his ass around pounding on
him, although not doing any damage.  I got invited and sends in the trusty
water boy.  Waterboy taunts and gets aggro'd upon and dies after taking like
six hits.  Next up, earth pet.  While doing the pet thing, I cast a few
nukes -- no dice -- resisted.  Back to secondary role, DS everyone in
melee -- that consists of a warrior, rogue, earth-pet, and a DW croc our
chanter charmed to sic on him.  We did little damage.

The guy was hitting us for around 60hp per pierce and forget about the BS.
thank god the cleric had breeze going and was able to keep the tanks topped
up.  After a while, Dirtius would complain about his head, "The pain...must
KILL!" and then run off and disappear off our targets.  A while later, he's
sneaking back and the thing starts over again.

We've tried not attacking him and hailing, no dice, "MUST KILL" and pierces
you for 60-70 hp.  The cleric healed him, cured poison, cured disease and
nothing.  The chanter even breezed him to see if that would work, nope.

We did charm a ghoul and sicced it on him and he ran off.  After the second
time he took off, we didn't see him anymore.

Anyone seen this guy before or know what the heck we were supposed to do?
