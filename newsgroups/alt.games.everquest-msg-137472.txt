Looted an SG the other day that some guy killed, looted, and left.  He 
was carrying essence of sunshine.  Didn't know what it was, so stuck it 
in the bank to look up later.  Forgot to look it up.  Heard someone 
auctioning to buy it, asked how much they'd pay.  "How many you have?" 
"One." "250pp."

...

Okay fine, 250 isn't that much to most of you.  All you who are still 
low enough to appreciate what I just said, please proceed to drool with 
me. :)
