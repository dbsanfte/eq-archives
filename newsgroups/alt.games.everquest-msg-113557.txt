Go to Lake of Ill Omen and stay there until youre 26 then go to
Frontier Mountins until you are 30 then to Overthere until you are 40
then to Dreadlands until you are 50 then Karnors Castle, Burning
Woods, Sebilis and so forth. Some call this the Sheeple route since
everyone does it and often the zones are filled with obnoxious
youngsters (you know....like the ones you had to put up with in Oasis)
but Ive met a lot a friends along the way and these are great xp
zones. If you really wanna change of pace try being a master in some
needed tradeskills.

By the way....when someone views your Magelo profile....do you get an
email informing you that youve been inspected? hehehe
