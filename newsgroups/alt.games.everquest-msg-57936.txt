Yes, the main thing about rare spawns in EQ is that what happened to
you is exactly the way its supposed to happen. Verant did that on
purpose in their extreme naivete. The odd thing is that it actually
works in the way that Verant intended but only if players allow it.
These kinds of spawns are simply not meant to be camped. 

Even timed spawns like Hadden in Qey hills are not really intended to
be camped, I saw a goofy druid at the spawn for like 12 or 18 hours
which is just insane. You don't "own" a spawn just because you are
selfish and sit there for 18 hours with an alarm clock for when Hadden
will come, its perverting the spawn and the designers intention. You
are supposed to just come back and check sometimes to see if he is up,
which again works very well as long as other players are not camping
and ruining it. What is laughable is when a person does the 18 hour
egg timer thing then calls it "kill stealing" if someone does like you
are supposed to and pop in to see him spawn while they are sitting
there and nuke him.

I have heard that you can get bilge to spawn though, but it more or
less involves being a high level ranger who can swiftly beat down
every roaming spawn from in front of unrest to that island in the
middle then see when new stuff pops and beat that down also. That is
the only way a ranger I knew (stingy bastard too = / ) got the totem
several times.
