I was browsing the wares in the Bazaar when a particular item caught my
attention. Centi Longsword. Interesting.. dont see those in the bazaar to
often. Then I noticed the price. 500 Plat. I immediately inspected the item,
and verified that it had the stats that I was expecting to see and it was
indeed NOT lore. So I hurry over to the bank, withdraw a chunk of change and
high tail it over to the Bazaar vendor. As luck would have it I was able to
get there before any of the other vulture... Errr Bazaar patrons... and
purchased said weapon.  I now have  newby ranger Silk farmer that has had
his job made much easier with this fine weapon. Now my question for you all
out there, is this just a by product of the newer uber equipment coming out
of PoP ? Or did I manage to catch one of those fabled Bazaar deals of a
lifetime ?

In either case, it made a poor little untwinked human in Freeport VERY
happy, as she was the recipient of my Centi SS that my little silk farmer
was using : )
