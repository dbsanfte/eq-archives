Quote from Jeff Butler:
"Basically, you can ride it, and move faster than you'd be able to on your
own two feet. According to Butler, because horses won't go any faster than
skilled players can travel, players on foot won't be disadvantaged because
all of a sudden monsters can run faster to make up for horseback riding."

I guess that could be taken two ways, but to me it means that mobs won't
have to move faster because horses won't go faster than a good sow.
