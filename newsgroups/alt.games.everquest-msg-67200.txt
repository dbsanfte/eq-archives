Not wuite true, but nothing a hard reboot won't fix anyway.

2 things that have been seen/heard of happening:

1: Memory leak bloating your swap file to extreme proportions. Guildmate
had a 1.95gb swap file the other day (:o/. Eating all available hard
drive space will effect performance.

2: I heard about the patch program running into an invisible loop,
putting some sort of internet call out over and over. Though there's
nothing to indicate it on the taskbar, it's viewable on crtl-alt-del and
chews up processor and connection time.

Both these are synopsis's of problems I've heard about. The overall
effect and general method are correct, but don't jump down my throat if
I've got some details wrong ):oP
