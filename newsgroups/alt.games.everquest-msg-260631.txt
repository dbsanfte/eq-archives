Its not about being worthy or not.  Its about having to draw the line
somewhere.

Its not a spoiler site, its not a place to ask "Iksar or Human???"
Serverwide channels, and serverwide forums are notorious for moronic people,
the same repetitive questions, and the same dumb arguments.  Join the
serverwide monk, cleric, enc channel if you want to see some proof of that.

By making high requirements, we don't have to deal with that shit.  It may
come across elitist (i had reservations myself in the first place), but
really its not.

Its not a spoiler site.  If you want spoilers, go to the safehouse or
something.  The board mods don't look kindly on spoilers of any sort. So at
least when you know everybody is beyond a certain level, its OK to talk
about mobs events or zones prior to that, without really feeding people
spoilers.

Its also not a board where people post tactics and pulling guides, for
others to "learn from".  So i don't really think your generic view of it is
quite right.
