Oh man! don't get me all upset now.  I've had my 'Buddy' for 10 years now,
he's an 11 yr old grey cat.  I'll be so upset when he passes on, he's
already starting to show signs of slowing down, I'm starting to cherish
every minute we still have with him.
Anyone who has never owned a dog or been owned by a cat understands the
grief you go through when your best friend goes over the rainbow bridge.
You will know the right time to take the dog food out of the fridge, let it
stay there as long as you like.
