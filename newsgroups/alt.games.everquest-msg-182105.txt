Heh.

If you had a charmed pet attack it as it gets to group, you could instantly
debuff and slow it, and he wouldn't so much as blink at you

When im slowing mobs in HoH (that would kill my shaman or enc in a matter of
seconds).. I do the following

If charmed_pet
    slow instantly
If warrior
    Did he proc EB yet?
        Yes
                 Cast slow right now
         No
                Cast slow at 95%
If me(monk)
    Slow at 95%

Never have a problem with agro.. with mobs being too tough at the start..
nothing

My favourite pop exp zone is no different to velks for me now.. even botting
3 chars and a 500 hitting hasted pet, its a boring trivial exp grind.  Just
what I like
