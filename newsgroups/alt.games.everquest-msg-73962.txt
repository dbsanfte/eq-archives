Generally, an NPC with "!" in front of the name is a placeholder put
in when there is a problem with the NPC that is supposed to be there.
Check around, and you'll probably find that on SoL opening day that
merchant was doing something bad, like selling AoW loot, or buying
batwings for 100 plat, or something like that, so they add a "!" to
its name in the spawn table and kill it, and it respawns in "!" form.
Things in "!" form basically don't do anything interesting, and it
stops the real one from spawning until they fix the problem.
