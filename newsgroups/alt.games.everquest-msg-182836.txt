Not much there in the third tier really.

MGB is fairly useless if soloing. Pretty much anything a cleric casts will
overwrite Glades.

Dire charm is lvl capped at like 46, so you have light blue pets at best.

Innate camo is very handy, and quick on the draw.

Enhanced Root - Depending on your play style I guess. Don't know many druids
that act like wizards, and use dots. No root breaking issues there.

Exodus and Quick evac. Exodus is handy incase of trouble, QE is a lame point
sink

Quick Damage- Again, depends on play style. The Spell Casting Fury
prerequisite sucks though.

Spell Mastery - Depends.... that prereq sucks and sure is a waste of points

I have my points in innate camo and MGB (lack of choice really).
Unfortunatly not much there to bother with :-(
