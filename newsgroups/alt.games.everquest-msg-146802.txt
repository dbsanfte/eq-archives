This was on the test server for awhile. Yes, they should have posted it
though.  I have no problem with it,  with ensnare you don't have to worry
about snare effect dropping and mob running full speed every 3 min. As
mentioned, it also makes the dot effect land on mobs that are immune to run
speed changes. It is not really a bad thing, but I agree,  they could have
lowered the cast time, I need to root the mob, even when snared , to have
enough time to cast epic w/o getting attacked.
