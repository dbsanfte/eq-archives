The short version in order...

They boost your armor's stats, the slots show how many augments you can have
and what kind (type 1, 2, 3 etc), they can be removed, they show up in
stats, always active, no level limits, and they work throughout norrath.

Here's the long version if you want it.  (By me.  Sorry if it's sucky, I've
had 3 hours of sleep in 2 days.)

 - WHAT THEY ARE/WHAT DO THEY DO
Augmentations are doohickeys (the jewels) that you can adhere to your armor.
Each gem has a stat or effect on it, which is then added to your armor.  For
instance, I have a pair of Golden Efretti Boots that give me +9 wis/int.  My
Druid won a +5 wisdom augment, which she put on the boots.  They're now +14
wis/+9 int--and no-drop.  The value does show up in the stats when you
right-click, and it'll show what kind of augmentation is being used.  Stat
augments--and I assume effect augments--are always active throughout Norrath
and are not level limited.

Any item with an augmentation on it automatically becomes no-drop.

However, they do not have to be on there permanently.  Each Wayfarer camp
has at least one vendor that sells a solovent that will let you remove the
augment.

 - ADDING OR REMOVING AN AUGMENT
To add an augment, find the "birdbath" at any Wayfarer camp and click on it.
You'll get a two-slot container to pop up (sorta like using a forge or
something).  Put the augment and the armor to add it to in and click
combine.  Boom!  Put the armor and solovent in to remove an augment.

 - WHERE TO FIND THEM
They drop in LDON dungeons, where they're random drops--I've gone many
nights with none dropping, and then seen six drop on another night.  I think
you can use your dungeon points to buy them sometimes.

 - DUNGEON POINTS
Each time you successfully finish an LDON adventure, you get points.  The
higher you are, the more points you get.  If you finish it but it's after
the 90 minute time limit, you'll get partial points.  You can save your
points up to buy things from the Wayfarer camps that can only be purchased
with those points.

To be able to buy some things, such as most spells, you'll have to have
earned at least X number of points in a given dungeon.  For instance, to get
Pack Shrew for my Druid, I had to earn 48 points in the Everfrost dungeon.

 - SLOTS AND TYPES
Almost every piece of armor has at least one slot on it; some have two or
three.  You can have one augmentation per slot.  The "type" is a restriction
of sorts (someone else may be able to explain this better).  For instance,
if no-drop armor is type 3, then the augmentation has to fit into a type 3
slot.

 - HOW MANY CAN YOU HAVE
As many as will fit on your armor.  I recommend putting the best--or
weakest--ones on the armor you'll want to keep for a long time.  That way
you'll almost never have to feel bad because you took off a nice +5 one to
upgrade your armor.

 - WHAT KIND ARE THERE
There are augments for every character stat, including resists, mana and HP.
Others have effects that'll impact your casting, spells or melee damage.  I
don't know where a list of those are, sorry.

Some groups will treat augments in two groups, major (stats like int, wis,
etc.) and minor (sv fire, +10 mana, etc.).  That's so that if someone's
Wizard wins a piddly +10 HP one, they're not ruled out for the nice +4 INT
one that drops later.  Your milage will vary.

Prost!
