No, zone lagging as when crossing over a narrow zone line, say Kilthor to
High Pass. Your avatar appears slightly before your screen updates and by
the time you get updated, you are rooted, DOT'd, and have 2-3 idjits beating
on you.

Clearly exploiting the technical short commings of the game in my book. If
it only happened once, that would be to many. It is SOP for MMO PvP, not
just restricted to EQ. One of those "Eat shit, a million flies can't be
wrong" kind of things.  It allows a technically and specifically inferior
player to cheap shot another player he couldn't beat otherwise. I can take a
loss, I do it all the time, I am just not real big about exploits.

I don't think it could be done effectively in Oasis since it has a wider
zone boundry.

There was no such thing on the solo PvP server. Once again, idjits would PL
a character up to 5, twink the snot out of them, then were attacking same
race level 1s in the newbie area. I think when their faction got low enough,
they would just delete that character and twink a new one.

After advancing out of the newbie areas, I remember running into a gnome
wizard who was killing everyone that wasn't short. I got a pass because I
was a halfling druid. That was pretty much the level of role playing and how
much justification was considered enough to kill someone. I thought it was a
bit on the low side.

There is a reason VI made the no rules server with the rule no combat below
level 5. It was because of all the knuckleheads that were slaughtering new
players at their spawn points or in their newbie areas.

Now I am sure all the PvP servers have exactly the same knuckleheads, just
that they can't kill rookies at their spawn point. For me the question
becomes: Are they no longer knuckleheads because gme mechanics won't let
them kill newbies or are they the same idiots?

Just a different def then mine. You are more PvP then PK, not the same
thing. PvP'er kills people that need killing.

Sort of. I could probably get to at least level 9 never leaving Riverdale. I
think the
Piranha alone would take me that far. I kind of wanted to go find some
action. I'm also pretty good at the game. I mean camouflage comes at level 5
so I wouldn't have to ever get attacked. That wasn't why I was playing the
PvP server though.

I take back what I said, you are a typical PK. See this is my point, you are
not concious about the nature of your playstyle. You confuse attacking
someone with 2 bubbles of health as PvP!

NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That is cheap shot artist.

You really don't have a clue, PvP'ers are NOT like you. I mean I think my
son and his best friend were ranked very high in Counter Strike, like top
200 in the world. They see this cheapshot bullshit that goes on in MMOs and
just get a pained expression on their faces.

Kid, I have just explained to you the way of the world. There is no one so
stupid as someone who does not know himself. I can only pity you.

If I don't know you, you aren't shit.
