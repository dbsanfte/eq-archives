They give exp up through 60.  When I was soloing EJ in my late 40s I
would often pop into CoM to see if I could pick up a group.  There was
a wizard in there nuking the goos.  I used to group with her just for
manasong, though she didn't mind if I tossed in some DoTs too.  She
said that with a bard singing she was able to nuke enough to be the
best exp spot she knew of, but I suspect her prefered mode was nuke,
nuke, nuke, afk for 5 minutes, nuke, nuke, nuke, repeat.
