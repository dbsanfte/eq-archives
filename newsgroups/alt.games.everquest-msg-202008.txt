    The Hate revamp has worked well, in my opinion. It gave higher-level
folks a place to go while preserving most of the features of the old Hate.
And it got rid of all the first floor/second floor stupidity that old Hate
had. "DON'T GO UP THE WALL, YOU'LL AAARRRRGH!"

    They mention it'll be a partial update, so I imagine they'll just fix
areas that don't work well or get much traffic now. Many people have
complained how bad the loot is off the Ring of Thule, for example, and I've
noticed that all the players that get components to spawn the dragon in 4C
are instead using them to get the FT 1 and almost no other stats ranged slot
item from the quest NPCs outside.

    SCF is the only place where there's real bias. Where nukes have ID, DoTs
have Efficiency and Duration (total damage, akin to ID) foci. The original
design, I imagine, was to improve the areas where DoTs were best (mana
efficiency and damage over duration) with their foci, and improve the areas
where nukes were best (immediate damage) with their foci. Problems arise in
raid situations, though, where the nuke casters are getting full bang for
the buck out of their foci and the DoT folks aren't getting much of anything
out of theirs when clearing trash mobs.

    In at least a few cases listed there (HoH, CoD, BoT) the problem isn't
poor loot. It's poor drop frequency.

    Smithing, Fletching, Tailoring, and Baking are right about where they
should be given what can be made with each. Brewing and JC are a tad on the
easy side, but they always were historically. Given the relative difficulty
of raising Pottery (it REQUIRES access to an enchanter or enchanted goods,
none of the other trades have this), it should have some better products
available for creation at the high end or it should have a skill path that
does not require a given class or classes to advance. When I say "better
products", I'm talking in comparison with blue diamond cultural smithing,
upper end Velious/acrylia tailoring, and "new wave" baking like Halas 10 lb
meat pies and Misty Thicket Picnics. The current lineup of pottery-made
products is too weak on stats or too religion-specific to sell well, except
for one item (Opal Encrusted Stein). And that one item is in a continuous
state of oversupply as it is also a skill-up path.
