Very true. Consider that unless you're running the game server, all your
connection has to "upload" is the details of what your client is doing,
but it has to "download" what all the other players (and anything
server-side) is doing, a far larger amount. That said, the amount of
bandwidth that games use is still small enough to fit comfortably down a
dialup in most cases, so it's all about the latency.

Really, there's no such thing as a dedicated circuit of any kind, at
least in consumer-internet land. The only difference between cable,
dialup, and DSL is the point at which your traffic starts going over the
same pipes as other customer traffic, and even this can vary wildly
between different providers, depending on their network setup.

So I'd have to echo the advice of others here - try it, and stick with
what works for you. I switched from SDSL just like yours to cable just
last week, and I've noticed no real difference (I switched because my
DSL service didn't work all of the time - I was too far from the
exchange; it would work amazingly well, except of course any time it
didn't work at all, which was too often for my gaming habit).
