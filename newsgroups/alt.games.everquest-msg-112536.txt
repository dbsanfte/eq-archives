  Your server probably has a web site or ezboard out there dedicated to it.
Use Google and do a search on your server's name and maybe "ezboard" and see
what comes up.  Then browse the board, particularly the events category, and
see which guilds seem to be mentioned the most as doing lots of raids and
stuff.

  The largest/most powerful active guilds are usually refered to as "uber"
guilds and often they have a level requirement (and sometimes other
requirements... I've heard of one guild that requires its members to be
level 60, unless they're a cleric in which case they can be 53, requires
that they own J. Boots and several keys to various areas, among other
things.)  This may or may not be the kind experience you're after.
Sometimes these guilds take the game a lot more seriously than your average
player, and it can be a turn off to someone who wants to relax and enjoy the
game.

  Finding good, active guilds that aren't necessarily "uber" can be a little
more difficult, but they're out there.

  Good luck.
