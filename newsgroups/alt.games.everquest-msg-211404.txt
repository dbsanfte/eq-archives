Unfortunately, as you may have read in the developer chat, they can only
support a finite number of instances with the system they are using.
Scaling them for 2-6 people as you are suggesting would then limit even
more the number of people able to use one of the instances, and as
player presence in the instance is likely the least of the factors
effecting the machine resources used it wouldn't be very cost effective.
It also wouldn't be fair to other players locked out because a group of
2 or 3 were using an instance that could support twice that number.

I also wouldn't read a lot into the scalable part. They haven't said
anything really about scalability other than relating to level.
Everthing else has been mostly fan speculation.
