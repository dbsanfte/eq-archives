Someone earlier mentioned that those on the 10-day trial are on their own
special server.  If you're getting hooked on the game I wouldn't worry about
it...just buy the "real" game and start a character on one of the real
servers.

Don't be put off by all the bugginess right now...it's going to be a bitch
for the next week or so but I'm confident that Verant will get it back to
working correctly within a few days of SoL launch.
