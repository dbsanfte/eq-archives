I don't make any effort to - This is with hp/ac gear on and full buffs.
I'm not wearing _anything_ for it's stat boosts if I have access to a
+hp or higher AC alternative

If you have access to a primal weapon, you will be in the same
situation. Near best SoV equipment which, unlike Kunark armour, offers
stat boosts on every item. It's even easier for a warrior with the extra
~60 dex latent from the offhand epic. Therefore, when the primal procs
the first time, you will not be getting a +100 dex boost, since most of
the benefit will 'overflow' the 255 max

If someone is of a level, and in a guild capable of raiding sleepers,
there is ***NO WAY*** a melee character would have only 100 dex. Maybe
if they were unbuffed and naked, but I doubt anyone's actually tried.

Another point is that all proc rates are not equal. You would have to
proc avatar, then switch back to the test weapon and measure procs from
there to get an 'accurate' comparison
