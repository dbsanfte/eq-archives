keke, you mean like AE-taunts now acting more like an AE-memblur?

Well if an encounter changed, im sure they'd have the low-down on it.
I don't know if they were just unprepared, or the encounter is just fucked,
but when you have a "trivial farm mob" now wiping you at 98%, alarm bells
should be ringing.

Also remember KtF does know what they are doing (they've killed everything
FoH/AL has, I think 4th/5th server to clear powater)...  the problem seems
to lie in the fact you can tash and slow a mob on inc with no agro (this
part owns) but if your druid/shaman does a 800crit heal, their ass is dead
(this part isjust funny)

The only way a ranger can get agro off me now, is with a bow crit.  He can
snare till hes blue in the face, the mob don't give a fuck.  But 1 crit,
just one bow crit, and hes insta-summoned!

Umm rampage has always been bigger range than melee range
