Reagan was in power for eight years. So was Clinton. That's plenty long 
enough for the effects of their economic policies to be felt during 
their mandates, no matter how sluggish your metaphorical ship's steering.

Mind you, as long as the rich are getting richer, G.W. Bush's economic 
policies *are* being successful, according to his own personal value 
system.
