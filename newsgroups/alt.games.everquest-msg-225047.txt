Nothing is wrong with it.  There's plenty more they should borrow from DAoC,
in fact.  DAoC's implementation of player housing, for example, is nice, and
actually makes it so there is a point to having a house, other than just
showing off your wealth.

Getting rid of the ZEM and replacing it with group and camp bonuses like
DAoC has would be good.  Basically, when a group of mobs have not been
killed in a while, they have a large bonus.  If you kill a camp, the respawn
has less bonus.  Kill it again, and the respawn has even less.  Soon, there
is no bonus.  This bonus can be significant.  I'm level 45, and level 46
mobs give me 24.1 million XP.  Level 47 and above mobs give me 26.2 million
(which is the XP cap for my level...but that cap is only on the base XP, not
the bonus).  I'm mostly fighting stuff that is 46-50 (Necromancer...as
overpowered in DAoC as it is in EQ, which is why I consider fighting mobs of
my level or lower slumming!).  On a camp that no one has been at for a
while, I'll get a bonus of about 7.9 million per mob.  If I kill a few and
move on, I can keep the bonus up.  If I just sit around and camp, it will
drop down, and that makes a very noticable difference in the XP rate.

Borrowing is good.  I'd not be surprised if Mythic looked at Planes of Power
when they were designed their latest expansion, Trials of Atlantis, which
also features a sequence of encounters that you work your way through in
order.

I just find this particular instance funny, because not only are the special
moves very similar to DAoC's styles, but rather than base them off of
Stamina, which is what I would have expected, they create a new thing,
Endurance, for them--that's funny because Endurance is what styles consume
in DAoC.
