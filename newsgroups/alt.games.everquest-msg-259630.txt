Good plan!

Nope, nobody wants wizards, move along, nothing to see here.

Now this one I knew going in; the class isn't finished yet, and they 
apparantly decided after the Beastlord debacle that the safe way to 
approach things is to build it wimpy and then add power, instead of 
building it too powerful and then nerfing.

At the moment, I can't imagine what use anyone is going to have for a 
class that does less DPS than other DPS classes and contributes only 
snare (like half the classes in the game) and Stun (which most mobs in 
high end are immune to)

However, the UN reasoning behing the "lost" for the class is not 
specific to the class, rather its that because its a recently added 
class, so a typical member is going to have fewer points in the class 
AA's.  Which is ludicrous, as most of the class AA's aren't particularly 
useful looking anyway, and you can easily find berserkers with 200 AA at 
65 while you can easily find members of other classes at 65 with only 10aa.

I recall a similar moment with my mage, way back when; I crashed out, 
and when I came back in, I engaged the mob the party was on and didn't 
accept the invite till after it died.  KS'd em, then hit follow, and 
said "any more questions about where the DPS is coming from?"

And that didn't count the damage that the DS I'd cast on the MT was doing!
