I agree. Was quite dissapointed about the lack of flying, twirling, whipping in
the wind, hoods pulled closely and general lack of cloakage in EQ. After all
they're so versatile.
/em stands tall, the wind snatching desperately at his billowing black cape, an
undulating shadow in the failing sun.
/em Pulls his heavy cloak close to ward off winters icy fingers and slips away
unseen.
/em pulls the cavernous hood up close, throwing the anguish on his face into
shadow.
