Ah ha, I was waiting to see what the "hook" would be that would try to
get people to buy LDON whom it would be a waste for. This is it, like
the maps and junk was the hook for LOY.

It is sad they have to depend on hooks, since with each successive
expansion they alienate more of the player base with their "everyone
must group with 5 or more people in order to do anything!" party line.

Somehow I'm thinking this will be convoluted up the ass. It will
probably be a bit like their old POP quote about quest npcs who'd take
your old armor on turn ins. They did not say what armor, but it turned
out to only be fear and hate old armor. In this case I'm betting it is
only a few items or some insane quest/rare drop to be able to do it.
