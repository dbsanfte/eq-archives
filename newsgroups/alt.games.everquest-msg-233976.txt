Which they weren't, which was the problem. They guy sucked all his
mana for heals, and then disbanded to get the kill xp.

As a cleric, you could try to  fear the mob in question. It won't
prevent him from killing it, it won't get rid of his buffs, but it may
create a nice train.

Other than that, you might try some 'social engineering' to get him to
regroup, and proceed to debuff him... although that will just send him
back to pok for more. :(
