Yes that is the limiting factor. Since monsters can not zone they can only
get as high as the highest XP they can expect to get from the zone. Now I
was able to play a goblin whelp and a decayed skeleton in Warslik Woods and
the possibilities there are staggering. Imagine if you spend the time to
make a Uber Goblin Whelp or Uber Decaying skeleton. Guards will not attack
you either. =)

I was also once a scorpion in FoB. Made the trip over to see The Tangrin and
of course he beat on me a little. =)
