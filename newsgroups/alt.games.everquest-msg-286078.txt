Just because lots of people bought it doesn't mean they were happy
with what they got.  I've heard complaints about BC being much more
of a grind than original WoW.  And the size limit on the newer raids,
together with requirements for certain classes on those raids, have
caused some guilds to go into political upheaval.

I don't claim to know one way or the other whether WoW is losing
players, but I wouldn't be surprised if they are.
