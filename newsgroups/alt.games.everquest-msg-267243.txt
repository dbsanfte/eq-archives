That is correct.  If you qualify for any of the in-game items, entering 
/claim will bring up a window that shows you what you qualified for.  In my 
case, I subscribed to EQ2 under the same station name I used for EQ1 when I 
played.  As a result, my /claim window said that I qualified for 1) Server 
title ("of Drinal") and an EQ Live painting, and 2) an EQ2 painting.
