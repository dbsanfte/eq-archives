Deliberately pulling the Banker is worthy of a warning, However, based
on what you said, it was an accident,  and the GM should have left you
alone.  Couple weeks ago someone was talking about some idiot who was

un-usable.

precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when

apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
