> notice excess of supply over demand.  exactly what I was previously
saying.

Items constantly enter but never leave . Platinum changes hands it rarely
leaves . Both are fairly easy to fix . Merchants need to pay a base price on
items based solely on their rarity and difficulty to acquire . This will
cause items to have a floor price . Then there need to be ways to exchange
platinum for REAL character improvement . At the moment the only use for
platinum other than as an exchange is tinker bags , speed booties, spells ,
training , and a few quests. Luclin will add horses at the very least but
thats probably not enough . There are however many minor improvements that
could be made to a character that could cost extreme amounts of plat .
