Greetings all,

My 37 magician moved to the overthere yesterday for the sole purpose of
levelling up to 39.

The last time I was here, (32, if I recall) I wasn't able to solo too well
on the FM side of the zone, and went back to the old world to study the
finer points of Rathe Mountains.

I'm looking for advice on whether I should solo or group, and what area has
the most lucrative (XP-wise) hunting...how are the ruins, what lvl is
howling stones, what should I avoid,etc...

Any pointers much appreciated,

Jeenious Incarnate
