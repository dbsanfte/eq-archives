    He isn't other people. He's who he is, with his own expectations and
goals.

    So that's his goal. Just as some people set out to master every
tradeskill. If one tradeskill capped at 90, they'd complain, and they'd be
as justified as he is.

    To achieve whatever in-game goals you have set for yourself. His goal,
as stated above, is to be the slayer of all and baddest of the bad, to "own"
EQ. If an action doesn't help him meet that goal, he won't do it - it won't
bring him enjoyment.

    Something can only have "meaning" relative to an observer. If Furor
thinks killing Vulak first has meaning, then for him it does. and nobody can
take that away. And that's why we play games - to have fun achieving goals
we feel are meaningful. My buddy won't play one board game I play with his
wife becuase he feels the game is too random - winning is "meaningless" to
him. She and I disagree, so we play. Yes, a game other than EQ - don't know
how I find the time. ;-)

    OK, now to the NEXT part of the Furor argument. When they bought
Velious, they assumed they would be busy "conquering" it until the NEXT
expansion came out. But instead, months before SoL is due, they've run out
of things to kill. They feel that VI should add/modify content so there'll
be challenges until much closer to SoL.

>The only question to answer is: Is he or anyone else that plays the

    They are when there's something to do. ;-)
