Huh? The point system *is* shared. The only limit is that you have to 
earn x points in a dungeon to unlock its items. Ie... if you want 5 
700AP point items from guk, you just have to get 700 AP points in guk to 
unlock the items at that price, but you can get the other 2800 in tak if 
you want.

At that point you will have 0 current AP, and have guk to 700AP, and tak 
to 2800.

If at that point you earned 1000AP in ruj, you would unlock ruj up to 
1000, so you could spend it all in ruj. Or you could spend it all in tak 
(because thats unlocked to 2800). Or you could spend up to 700 of it in 
guk (because guk is only unlocked to 700)...

Its a *very* fair system, overall. One of the things they did right. Its 
just too bad some themese are categorically easier than others... that 
was kind of dumb.
