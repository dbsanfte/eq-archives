I haven't checked their little board, nor do I care to, but I am curious 
enough to ask if the general public can -read- the boards, even if they 
can't -post- to it. If they can read it, that would seriously mitigate 
any elitist complaints.

On the other hand, if the attitude is that you have to be at endgame to 
even be worthy of seeing the thing then yeah, 'elitist' is exactly the 
right word to use.

Its one thing to want to keep the 'riffraff' from taking a board over. 
Its something else if they want to prevent the 'riffraff' from even 
seeing what they have to say.

God forbid the riffraff be allowed to learn something from the endgame 
player right?
