Finally!  Trekkers are here!

While not really trivia (and not even TOS), I have a very important
Trek question that some of you might be able to answer.  This will
settle a long-standing bet that I have with a friend.  The answer is
not out there on the 'net.  I have searched and searched, but I still
have not found it.  This makes no sense, because question is of such
profound significance that I thought someone somewhere *must* know the
answer.  The answer will forever change the way you view Star Trek. 
Yet to this day, it remains a mystery.  So please, if you can, someone
answer this question:


  Who has bigger tits - T'Pol or Seven of Nine?


I say it's T'Pol.  My friend says it's Seven of Nine.  Who wins the
case of beer?

Thanks.
Miles
