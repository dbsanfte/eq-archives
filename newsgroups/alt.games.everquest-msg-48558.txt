They had a battle between Innoruuk and Mithaniel Mar.  In the gathering of
DE before the battle I took a shot at Innoruuk with my level 10 necro.  I
figured a dark elf has a right to hate even his own god.  Of course it was
resisted and he gave me a lifetap or something that killed me with one
casting.  No problem, I was bound right there anyway.  Then Mithaniel Mar
entered the zone and everyone met up at the bridge.  Both gods grew bigger
and bigger.  Then I blacked out.  Too much lag.
