I think I'm gonna start a 3-box crew on the Combine server, and all I 
know for sure is that I want one of them to be a mage. The following are 
some of the things I am interested in addressing with my class selection. 
These should be viewed as guidelines, and not a list that must be 
satisfied in its entirety:

1) I want a group that can minimize downtime. I don't necessarily need to 
have all the various utilities covered, but it would be nice if each 
class to complement the other in some way.

2) Part of the reason I'm doing this is to provide a high level of self-
sufficiency.

3) I want to be able to handle some of the tougher mobs later down the 
road so I will be able to obtain the desired spell drops, etc.

4) It would be nice if I could do LDoN's or DoN's without additional help 
when necessary.

5) I don't want to wind up with more than one attention-intensive class 
in the bunch. People mention bards as a good candidate, but /melody, 
though helpful for a solo player, really doesn't become all that useful 
in a boxing environment until the necessary AA's are spent. Until then, 
frequent missed notes make it unreliable, as I experienced with my 60 
bard on FV. Even at that level, it would frequently get interrupted.

Some of the other classes I am particularly interested in are (in no 
particular order): cleric, necromancer, ranger, enchanter, shaman (though 
my current main is a shaman), warrior and druid.

I mentioned efficiency as a goal, but I'm not really all that concerned 
with fielding the "best case scenario". I'm more interested in playing 
the classes I like without giving up too many of the benefits of multi-
boxing.

Anyone have any experience with all caster multi-boxing? Does the mage 
pet tank well enough to forego a plate tank? Could a ranger even begin to 
with the right buffs, debuffs and heals in place? Also, keep in mind that 
this crew will be on a progression server, so gear and available buffs 
and various other expansion-related resources will not be available for 
quite some time.

I should add that I am also considering classes that I would find 
interesting to play as singles in groups or raids as well. In addition to 
mage those would be necromancer and ranger. Hmm, what does everyone think 
of a mage, necro, ranger combo? No slow or haste, though. :/

Any suggestions would be appreciated.
