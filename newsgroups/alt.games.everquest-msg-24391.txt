Thanks for all the info everyone!  It sounds like I need to do some
more research as to what is trying to run in the background.  One
thing I'm testing is that whenever I get an incoming call on call
waiting a box does pop up asking if I want to answer the call.  I
forward my home phone to my cell phone to try to correct this but I've
noticed that sometimes the box will pop up even when it's forwarded. 
I haven't been able to tell if this is happening when the cursor thing
starts though.  I've disconnected call waiting for now so we'll see if
this helps at all.  Once again thanks for the ideas!! :)
