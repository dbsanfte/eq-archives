Why do you care why I care? The only bitching and moaning is coming from 
you, little one. Do Mommy and Daddy (assuming he is known to you) know 
you're behaving in such a manner? Shame on you.

thus allowing me to file you where you belong. ;)

*plonk*

What I mean to say is that I am killfiling this person. Forever. Really. As 
soon as I post this message. I'll forego any confirmation post to that 
effect. :P
