One other trick my love tells me is a saver: make a Next Tank key.

/target ThirdTank
/target SecondTank
/target MainTank

Assuming you stay in /target range, hitting this button will flash through
your tanks and end on the MT - UNLESS the MT is down, in which case it lands
on the ST - unless the ST is down, in which case it lands on the TT...  Five
lines, you can have five tanks in a row and as soon as the raid leader
screams (in a cheerleader-like fashion) "MT Down!  Switch!" you chuckle
because you've already hit this key and you're targeted on the ST, and the
chain continues.

Really helps when you get a lucky flurry.
