Maybe it is because I have been playing way too much time in a game where there
are so many variations of hominoid running around, and maybe it is because I am
just getting old, but I found myself thinking the other day, while a black
sales clerk waited on me, "Isn't this whole skin-color thing no different than
what kind of clothes one is wearing?"

I mean, let's face it, the various colors should be viewed as variety, not
difference. 

Yet, the reality is that as long as we collectively view skin color as a
difference, we divide ourselves up into "us" and" "them". And that is what make
us different. We adopt the styles and mannerisms of "our people" and view
others as "those people".

Most of the men here would admit to having a strong desire to really (pardon
the crudity here, but I wish to speak in honest terms of how we really think)
slam it to Mariah Carey or Jennifer Lopez over and over. Yet make them a few
shades darker and for the most part we don't find them attractive.

If Vanessa Williams was 30% darker we would not have lusted after her pictures
in Playboy or Penthouse.

Why?

Too much tan that much of a turn off?

James is a person. The color of his skin should be as irrelevant as the shoes
he wears. I look forward to th day when saying he is black, or his friend is
white, has as few connotations as saying, "See the brunette over there..."

Even though I know I will not live to see it.
