Prejudiced people always have ammunition, mainly because their shots don't
have to make sense.

Well, I'll never argue against someone bitching about PC. You get one point
here.

Nexus? Poor

All raiders had a portbitch on a second account? Oh, I see further down that
yall LIKED travel time. So your prejudice is against ports period.

Shadowhaven? Poor casuals

Which raiders love? Which proves raiders are retarded?

Bazaar? Poor

Automation of tedious & time consuming chores is one of the primary benefits
of the microchip, Ben.

PoK? The casual's

Raiders like killing greens and handing in batwings? Yall like 30 minute
boatrides, having to zone 14 times, etc..?

Tier 2/3 exp gain levels? Gotta get those casuals up in

Soooo many times I've been grouped with a raider, who suddenly ditches the
group for a better spot in a flagged zone, never once has one said "damn
this is too fast, let's head to luclin or something." Do YOU aim for the
slowest xp possible, Ben?

Advance to L65? Gives casuals

I bet you kept yourself at level 60 to make Quarm more fun, didnt you Ben.

LDoN? Nice

Kinda like how POP linked all the raider's zones thru Tranquility? God
forbid in a world where magic exists some of it is used efficiently. (should
be a 5 plat charge per farstone trip, tho)
And the raiders farmed LDON too, they just did it several times faster, so
they werent there as long.
They earned their hp augs QUICK, while picking up loots they could sell to
us for ~50k plat per.

When was the last expansion without a single raid target? You people just

The whiney anti-casual ranter is the worst blight in AGE atm. Worse than
scams, viruses, porn spam, all of it.
All of the changes you ranted about, were done for Sony's customers, raider
& casual alike.

Why is it unreasonable to want to have fun & do little WORK, while playing a
GAME?

Why is it unreasonable to want access to third or fourth best gear even
though you cant play at peak times?

Why is it unreasonable to want to see more content while avoiding raid
guilds, which almost invariably have that one guy that whines about the good
old days when EQ made you bleed irl?
