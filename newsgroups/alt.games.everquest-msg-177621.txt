My Wiz just made 45.  Even with POK ports available, I get tells from
people in other zones wanting me to come port them somewhere (for
instance just last night while I was quadding wolves in DSP, a guy
wanted me to port to Gfay to port him to Nro).  I can't even imagine
how bad it was before POK.  Long live the Books!

PS I do agree that much of the flavor of the world is gone.  I
remember fondly my planning a trip from Shar Vahl to Everfrost to get
my 9th level Shaman spells (they weren't sold on the moon then). 
Quite a long and exciting trip.  Now it would be click book, run a
bit, click book.  Not quite the same.
