Unfortunately I am a Ubisoft customer so I'm guessing I won't be getting the 
email with the free Buddy key.  If anyone gets one and doesn't want to use 
theirs I would love the opportunity to get one.  Leave a response here if I 
could have yours and we can set up a way to communicate and send me the key.
  That is unless someone can confirm that Ubisoft customers are getting the 
emails also.
