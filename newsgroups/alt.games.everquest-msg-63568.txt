I have NO idea. I do know that the name he did want, Fjompenissen[1],
was rejected. I have no idea why he wanted THAT either. He's
a silly boy ;)

>(And I still think Maxmekker is sillier)

So how do you feel about my other friend, Mikkey Mooze?
An ogre, I might add.

Actually, Maxmekker is kinda cool. It's not offensive, although
it's definitely a copyrighted name, so could be petitioned on
that rule. How about a pair of gnomes called Pompel and Pilt?
That'd rock! And an ogre called Gorgon! Mwahahaha! It'd be
soooo cool! Only norwegians will get this paragraph.

Speaking of Santa Claus, who's looking forward to meeting
Santa Clugg more than his real-life counterpart? I do!

[1] I have NO idea what to translate THAT one as. Cel?
