>How about those shuttle docks to FV?

All the port cities always had 2 docks.  In East Freeport you can still see the
signs by the docks that say "Travel to Faydwer" "Visit Kunark" (or something
close) meaning there might have been plans for a boat to go from Freeport to
Kunark.

Before Paineel, Erudite Necromancers had it real rough.  All they had was a
small building in Toxx with a few Guildmasters and spell vendors.  Back then if
you went to where the Paineel zone is now, it was blocked by a cave-in and
skeletons with pick-axes stood around complaining about working (kinda funny).

The "Big Mouth" portal in the Feerrott has always been there, if you touched it
before it was open you would be sent back in-between Oggok and the bridge (just
like if you're too low to enter).  When fear first opened it was very easy, you
could walk all over without aggroing anything.  Cazic-thule didn't have
deathtouch, he cast level 49 shadowknight spells and melee'd pretty hard.

You bet.  Especially the epic quests.  When they were introduced, suddenly
there were level 55 NPCs standing all over in odd places.  Beholder's Maze,
south karana, Lavastorm, OOT, and a dozen more zones now had NPCs standing
around in arbitrary places with 8 - 10 people asking who/what/where/why
questions to solve the epic quests.
