Um, so what you are saying is that my wireless connection has negative
latency?  The ping times I see in EQ with my external wireless modem vary
from 70 to 140ms.  If my external device is adding 100.....

Also, not to pick nits, but generally, use an external modem for DSL, unless
you feel like setting up a Linux or other system as your router and
firewall.  It's far easier to use an external device with a 10/100baseT
connected to a router/hub/firewall.
