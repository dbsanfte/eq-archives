Well, you guys solved half the problem.  I'm a bit embarroused that it
didn't occur to me try right or left clicking to unfreeze the cursor
stuck in the corner problem.  But it did work.  Thanks!  That was
fustrating.

   Still crashing at character selection, though.  I can see it for a
second, and see my gnome enchanter (first one, alphabetically)
spinning for a split sec, then the I crash to desktop.  On my taskbar
EQ is still shown as running, but I can't click or tab into it.  I am
not running EQ windows or any other third party programs, and I don't
think I have a firewall, though I will have to check with Lenny to
make sure of it.  Oh, and I did a full patch of all expansions and
files.

   I dunno.  Maybe I have some sort of corrupted file or something?  I
have no idea of what to delete from the EQ folder, if that is the case
though.

I am grateful for the advice I have gotten so far... anyone else got
any more ideas?

Annie
