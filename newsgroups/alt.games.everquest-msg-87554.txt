Bullshit!  It is much, much faster to travel with Selos, IF you know how 
to do it.  Here is the correct way (I really need to hotkey this):

Bard is NEVER the leader.  Bard appoints a leader.  Everyone puts leader 
on /autofollow.  Bard starts selos.  Bard goes to 3rd person view, scales 
out so that can see all members.  Leader listens to bard, and bard only.  
Bard tells leader to go, verifies that everyone is in a nice tight knot 
about 30 feet behind the leader.  If anyone is 30 feet behind the group, 
chastise the idiot for not following the fucking directions, stops the 
group, gets idiot /autofollowing the correct person.  If the idiot still 
fucks it up, make them the leader.  It is almost impossible for anyone to 
fall back using this method.  If the leader gets too far ahead (and 
auto-follow range is much larger than selos range), selos drops and he 
slows.  Everyone else is right next to the bard.
This is slightly more tricky if using Selos Song of Travel, because some 
people can't seem to realize that being 500 feet above the ground is a bad 
thing.  Tell them once to keep close to the ground, if they fall, chalk it 
up to natural selection.
The hardest part about this is that 90% of the people in the game have no 
idea where they are going or how to get there.  As a bard, you should be 
used to running places, so you can direct the leader.  Assume the leader 
has no idea where he is, and give very clear, concise directions.  
Example:  In TT going to Seb, tell leader when you zone in from SoNH, 
'Head SOUTH to n1500, then head directly EAST, I'll update you when we 
pass under the arch.'  Don't use landmarks, unless they're very obvious.  
Turn left at the 2nd rock is bad.  Turn right at the big Iksar statue over 
the stream near the ocean is good.  
As to places being far from the spires, I can't think of a single place on 
Norrath that is more than a 15 minute run with Selos from a spire.  A bard 
with Selos can run from BW zone through DL, all the way to the eastern end 
of FV to check on ancient jarsath and BACK to DL in the time a jboots 
character can run from spires to KC.  I can run from DL spires to Seb in 
12 minutes, without taking the most direct route.
