As of now, there is no PvP in EQ2.  There are hints of its possibility in
the future, but, at the time of this writing, none.

I have not found a class that cannot be soloed to some extent.  There are
none that can perform the ancient Druid technique known as "Quad-Kiting", so
that sort of thing is out, but my Bard, my Druid, and my Crusader all do
equally well soloing, though they must choose different prey, and I prefer
the Crusader for soloing so far.  I cannot speak to the caster types.

> Also, any advice for a first time EQ2 player?

My first bit of advice is to do every quest that comes your way.  I have
manged to get to and through level 10 and never leaving the inner zones.
The quest rewards are, even solo, well worth the efforts.  If you research
them well, you can manage to do a good number of quests quickly by
consilidating your trips.  Allakhazam, once again, seems to have the "goto"
site for item and quest information: http://eq2.allakhazam.com/.

While there are in game maps for the town and major outdoor zones (Antonica,
Commonlands, Nektulos and the like), I use The Tower of Dreams
http://www.gry-online.pl/eq2/index.asp.  Getting around Qeynos, and I
presume that Freeport is similar, there are two things that are important to
remember and learn.  The Mariner's Bell (Connects to almost all city zones),
and the "sewer".  Qeynos calls it the Down Below, and Freeport calls it
Theives Way, but these sewers connect ALL of the city zones.  They also make
it possible for someone from the opposing City to enter their antagonist's
inner sanctum (Took my Qeynos Druid through the sewers last night and got a
close look at North Freeport).  You are safe there until a guard spots you.
He will "attack" you, and instantly port you back outside the city, no
damage, just a "Get the hell out of my city" thing.

Best of luck and enjoy.  I know that I am.
