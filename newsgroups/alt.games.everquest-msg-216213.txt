How long do you think it takes to know a dungeon well?  After having been
through a dozen or more adventures, I'm quite confident that I could run
from zonein to the farthest point in any LDoN dungeon and back out to zonein
through a full pop and live.  Some places really test my spatial sense. 
I've always had problems remembering my way around the maze of Ssra, for
instance.  But LDoN dungeons are *very* straightforward.  Most puzzling
thing about any LDoN dungeon that I've seen are some interesting cloverleaf
halls with a hidden nook, but since I saw that same thing three times in a
row in the same dungeon last night, it's hardly going to be surprising to
find that there are mobs in the nook on the second one (they did a bit much
cut-n-paste in my opinion, though at least they built with well-designed
blocks).

As to what I kept the cleric at on my first adventure ever...  well, about
30%.  :) See, I was 2-boxing the cleric, and the enchanter was 2-boxed, and
I managed to get both the enchanter and the cleric killed (it was more of a
joint effort, but I cheerfully accept blame for it :).  Everybody else
lived, it wasn't a terrible pull or anything, just two 2-boxers trying to
get a feel for how it was all gonna work, so soon as I had enough of a tank
to get going again, I went.  Collection mission (which I have since learned
suck as far as time to complete), and we failed with one ear left to
collect.  If I'd have started pulling when my cleric was only up to 20%... 
we'd have won.  So actually, I was *too* cautious my first time through
(that and not the best 2-boxer in the world, which I freely admit).
