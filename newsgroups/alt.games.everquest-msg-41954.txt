Rogues us evade to LOWER the agro on them. My experience with the new
(nerfed, or "fixed" as verant puts it) is that a successfull evade will
lower your agro the equivalant of about 200-250 damage hits.  When I'm
teamed with Jakugg and we are both stabbing and slashing as fast as we can,
I have to evade constantly or I will be agro'ed.  Even by letting him engage
the mob solo and taunting for up to 7-10 seconds, I do enough damage to
sometimes turn the mobs before they get to about half life. If I can get
many successfull evades, I can keep the agro on the tank, but sometimes if I
get 2 or 3 failures in a row, the mob will agro and I will have to back off.
My evade hotkey disables attack, clicks hide and sense heading. If
successfull, I immediately hit attack again and backstab. If not, I hit
attack and sometimes hold on backstab. I aways click evade every 10 seconds
or so no  matter what.  Most times we fight, we can go many mobs before I
take any hits. This enables the healer (tiru) to focus on the tank and use
Complete Heals at the right times.

About rogues in general. I LOVE playing my rogue. My alts are all but
ignored. The ability to hide/sneak practically anywhere and take an AFK at a
moments notice is a VERY nice ability.  One point to all none rogues, always
stand on the opposite end of the mob as the rogue. Save the smelly end for
us as we are used to the stench. A rogue is the MOST group dependant player
there is IMHO. Most rogues will go out of there way to be fair and generous
groupers if they want to have friends invite them into future groups. When I
practice pickpocketing while grouping, I ALWAYS split the coins back to the
group, most times rounding the amounts up for the split. When grouping with
Clerics and other spell component classes, I ALWAYS try to carry gems for
their buffs, and most times give them gems for the whole group. More advice
is to let the rogues master loot as we are the perfect class to chase down
fleeing mobs. I ALWAYS give more then a fair share to the healers and other
medding casters.  When speed pulling, let the rogue finish the mob off while
the puller goes pulling and the tank gets healed. By the time we get back,
the next mob should already be engaged for a few seconds and we will have
less trouble staying low on the MOBS argo list.
