Seconded!  :)  Me being still a lowly 17 (and a half!) monk, I
wouldn't be able to donate much, or buff, but I could always
toss a few plat your way and teach you Lizardman, Elvish, even
Human (only 83 in that, though).  Oh!  And I have a bunch of
handmade backpacks rotting in the bank.  They're really too
heavy for me to carry around, not if I want to stay under the
weight limit.  I prefer the tailored waistbags.

I can possibly even donate some minor gear, depending on what
class you play.  :)

Join us.  You know you want to.  ;)
