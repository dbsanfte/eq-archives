I took the alternative method and put 5 into AGI, 5 into DEX, and 10 
into INT on my Ogre SK. I find that raising INT is harder than raising 
STA, because most of the INT stuff is quite low on AC, which is hard to 
compromise on.

I also did not want to be worried about raising DEX and AGI stats, so I 
made sure I had my minimum 75 on each. Raising STA has not been too hard 
for me, since the Ogre starts out with a lot of STA anyway, and items 
like Crustacean Shell have a LOT of STA are very affordable (although 
present another problem for minus DEX).

I also feel an SK is not JUST a meatshield (that's a warrior's 
specialty), and thus should have decent INT for extra mana used in 
damage dealing to compensate for the lack of duel wield.

I would recommend doing what I did. However, having said that, my SK is 
only 34 at the moment and as such has seen the high end game.
