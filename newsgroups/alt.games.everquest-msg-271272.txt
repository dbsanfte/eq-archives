Just as with the adventure skills, there are two types of tradeskills.   There
are the knowledge skills like craftsman.  These increase automaticly as  you
level.  They only govern which formulas you are allowed to scribe.  How well
you use the machines is based on the actual craft skill.   Woodworking,
Artistry or whatever.   The craft skills increase through use.   Each time you
create an item, you get a chance for a skill increase.   Also, using your
tier2+ abilities while creating an item gives a chance for a skill up.

Yes, 46 (actually, are you sure that isn't 55?) is the maximum you will get,
since you did not take outfitter.     Your max stopped increasing when you
chose craftsman instead.  If you want to level up the skill, you can create
tier 1 items using that skill (You do not recieve the tier 2 buffs, so you
can't use those to increase it).   But theres really no point to doing so.
You are prohibited from making any of the hard items which use tailoring.

Bandolier.  It's an ammo belt only worn strapped across the chest instead of
the waist.

Anyways... socieity tasks are given out by looking at what level you are.   It
gives you a task to create 10 of an item that is a few levels below your
current skill level.    So at level 15 craftsman, you will only get tasks that
require level 12 - 13 craftsman recepies.    Right now you are a level 11
craftsman... so it is choosing a level 8 or 9 recepie.   Since recepies up to
level 10 are artisian, not craftsman... it can be a task to create anything
from food to spells.   Anything a level 8 artisian can make.

So in other words, go up a few levels and you will only get craftsman
appropriate tasks.

See this I have trouble believing.    So I'm going to explain how it works...
since I think you're making a mistake somewhere.    Society tasks only require
that the finished product be "Shaped" level of quality.  The 2'nd level out of
4.   (and in fact you *must* turn in shaped quality for them to count.
Pristine will not count as completing the quest.  Use the "stop combine"
button when "shaped" quality is lit up as you're making it, to guarentee it
stays shaped instead of going up another level.)  This level of quality is
extremely easy to get, even with no skill.

What is happening most often when I hear people say they can't make an item,
is that they are using low quality primary components.  The primary component
is the one listed first, at the top of the recepie (it's even in its own
little section.)    The quality of this component will govern how high of a
quality finished product you are capable of making.

If you are using a shaped (level 2 quality) stretch of rawhide leather as your
main component... your bandolier will only have 2 possible levels of quality,
crude and shaped.  And getting it to come out shaped instead of crude (or
complete failure) will be *very* hard.   But if you are using a pristine
(level 4 quality) stretch of rawhide leather as your main component, you will
have 4 possible levels of quality that your bandolier can be.    You only need
to get it to level 2, shaped bandolier... so you can make mistakes up to
losing 2 full levels of quality before the item is a failure.    Even with no
skill, it's pretty easy to get the bandolier to finish before losing a 3'rd
level of quality.

So basicly, use pristine components for the main component, and you will find
it much easier to complete the tradeskill quests.

As I said before, at level 40 woodworker (at 20 you choose a subclass of
craftsman, woodworker / provisioner / carpenter... there is no level 40
craftsman) you will only be asked to make level 37 to 38 woodworker recepies.
You will not be asked to make level 37 tailoring recepies.

Yes, that is part of the "vision" for tradeskills.    They want players to be
buying the components from other players of different tradeskill classes.
They want a functioning economy where a craftsman will buy chemicals from an
alchemist, then use those chemicals to create burlap patterns which they sell
to tailors... and tailors will buy the patterns because they need one for each
piece of armor they are going to create, and they are unable to make it, only
you can, etc, etc, etc.
