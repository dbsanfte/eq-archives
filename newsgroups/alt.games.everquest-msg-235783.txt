The pro's and con's are minor IMHO. The Barbarian has greater strength
and stamina, which are nice in the long run, but nothing that can't be
evened with gear. The Vah Shir has nightvision, something that your
Barbarian will miss initially when dealing with the gnolls in
Blackburrow - But again nothing serious.

Safefall is inate for the Vah Shir - Something that come in handï¿½ from
time to time.

The bottom line is - Go with whichever you feel is 'talking' to you,
that is you are comfortable playing with. I have had both, but felt
more in 'character' with the Barbarian. I've easier to roleplay that
figure - You know the stout clannish type with his lone wolf sidekick
;-)

In my experience there is no 'best race' in the long run. All races
can be played and leveled equally good - or equally bad.

On a final note - The faction issue is more or less moot, you can
quest and work through almost any of those problems, but you are right
as a new player you don't need that extra to consider.

Have fun - And take care out there
