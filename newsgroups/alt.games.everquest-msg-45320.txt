Yes I have done a few of the letter quests.  I am trying to avoid bard
killing so that i can bank in freeport.  I know most of the damn bards
give a hit with Knights of Truth, so I don't want to kill them, cuase I
detest having to farm faction. When I left Paineel I went to Faydewar,
killed stuff in Steamfont til 12 , then went to Unrest with some
friends.  I then finally got a job after a long bout of unemployment,
but it's afternoons so I can't group with my friends anymore.  Did the
chessboard until someone was offering ports, and headed to WC.  Fought
wisps, though were already greening out.  Then I went to Sister Island
and have trashed my elf factions, making mucho plat in the process.  At
15 I have done sisters though greening out, and also the aviaks in OOT. 
Looking at OOT I think if I wanted to, I could probably stay there til
at least 50, though I think i would grow extremely bored and go insane
hehehe.  Basically wondering where to go at 15, I have tried basilisks
in Rathe Mtns, but I almost always seem to lose my pet to them, and
either get lucky and kill it or have to run for zone.  They are yellow
to me, so probably quite red to my poor level 12 pet.  I am using fear,
but the pet usually gets stunned and then killed as soon as fear wears
off.

Many guides say do the bards but i don't want to lose faction in N. FP. 
I suppose i could do the Oasis thing again, but I really despise that
zone now having taken 4 other characters through there in the leveling
process.
