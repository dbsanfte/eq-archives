The problem is,  if something else is wrong how do I sus that out? It
seems unlikely that its the display driver or settings as I can run
other OpenGL and DirectX games (on or offline) without incident. With
Zone Alarm uninstalled I have no problems running EQ. The most visible
factor here is Zone Alarm. Not to say that this is the only thing that
it could be, but in my experience as a tester the most obvious cause
of a problem is most likely the correct one although sometimes in
obscure ways.
