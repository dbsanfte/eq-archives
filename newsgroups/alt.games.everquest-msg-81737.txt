Trying to decide what race to make my new necro.. Don't have any preference
based on looks or location.  Main question is, for those experienced, what
is most important for a soloer?  The high INT of an Erudite, the night
vision of a dark elf, or the regen of an Iksar?  I lied about no preference,
I don't want to be a gnome :)
