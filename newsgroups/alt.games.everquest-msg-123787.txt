Ya know, sitting here reading my earlier post, it's almost as if
someone else had posted under my name. I have *no* idea what I was
thinking. Of course, you are right, Sanjian. For smithing it's the
higher of WIS/INT to determine skill ups with a slight modifier for
high STR. Success relies *solely* upon skill versus trivial. I'm
pretty sure I've never read that DEX plays into it, although maybe it
does for other tradeskills.

Who's got the dunce cap? I believe it's my turn with it for a while. 
:(

Rumble - been wrong before and promises to be so again.
