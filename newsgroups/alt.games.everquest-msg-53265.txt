There was a GM event in Oasis, several orc sized cyclops were trying to
get people to play games with them of some sort (follow the leader,
things like that) while a bunch of high levels slaughtered them.  Finally
a GM (who was there with GM invis on) shouted in frustration that
we weren't supposed to kill them.

I'd guessed earlier on, since they conned indifferent to me... I tend
not to kill stuff that doesn't hate me.

At any rate, we tried for ten minutes or more to get the remaining
NPC to do or say something in response to triggering phrases,
to no avail (he did say some stuff, but it was canned, not responsive)

Then he vanished, and another little cyclops showed up and handed
out items to a few people she claimed had tried to play with the
first set, things like a charred guardian shield, some kind of stien
(person wasn't excited, I think crude or muggok, not something
new)

While I think it sucks that people's first response was to kill, I think
the game has been going on long enough that the GMs would have
to be idiots not to know that was going to happen.  If you really
don't want the mob killed, then make it invulnerable, or stop
complaining.  By failing to do this, you make it possible for the
10% of the crowd too dim to grasp the concept of quest mobs
ruin what might be an amusing diversion for the remaining 80%
of us who are at least willing to try other approaches first.
(the other 10% see the presence of GM's as an opportunity to
go into deep roleplaying mode in /shout, I suppose looking for
brownie points)

While its possible that the remaining NPC simply couldn't be
triggered without his brothers saying something, that seemed
to be poorly planned too.  We really looked back over
everything they had said while being slaughtered and couldn't
find any triggers at all.  Closing up the event by handing out
items arbitrarily once again reinforced my view of GM
events as badly thought out Monty Haul episodes.
