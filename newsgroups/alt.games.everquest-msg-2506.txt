Good view to have for a Cleric. =)

Here is an easy formula to remember when you want to know if you will get
experience with someone else of higher level.  If half your level plus your
current level is higher or equal to theirs, you will get experience.  If
it's not, then you won't.  As you would notice, the game allows for a wider
range of levels in a group at higher levels.

Example: I'm level 6, and the other person is level 10.  Using the formula,
I wouldn't get experience if I grouped with them.  I'd have to be one level
higher, or them one level lower.  That's basically where the 3 to 4 level
spread in lower levels comes from.

2nd example:  I'm level 35, and my friend is level 50.  I would get
experience grouping with him.  (Believe it or not)  35 divided by 2 is 17.5,
so add 35 plus 17.5 and you get 52.5, above the level he is.  We tried the
formula out in our guild, it does work this way.

Short answer: yes, it changes at higher levels. =)

Just one comment here: if the "newbie" doesn't have a main that can pass on
something to their alt, or doesn't have a friend who can help with the
transfer, then they most likely are still a newbie(or no one likes them)
