The point is, since almost everything in the roleplay preferred server is
droppable, the potential for extreme twinking is enormous.  Allowing only
one character per account on this server is the best way to encourage each
character to earn what he or she has, as opposed to having it given to them.
People will always find ways to twink anyway, but allowing only one
character per account helps to limit it.

This is all just my take on it.  There may be other reasons I haven't
thought of.
