If I leave a corpse unlooted until it becomes lootable by all, I wouldn't
have a problem at all with someone else looting it.  Or on occasion where I
did, I would only blame myself for the mental error, not the person who did
the looting.  Obviously, this does not apply in the case of raids and such,
where the corpse has to be left until anyone can loot, but where I would be
seriously pissed to see just any old Joe walk in and loot it.  But for your
everyday kills, I have 2 minutes of exclusive loot rights to my kills.  If I
cannot be bothered to loot it within that time frame, shame on me then if
someone else loots it instead.
