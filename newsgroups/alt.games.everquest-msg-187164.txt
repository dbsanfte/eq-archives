Currently my Warrior is 53rd...I am in one of those rare (for me) stages
where I intend on levelling, just to explain I do not enjoy levelling for
levelling's sake and my target is 56th where upon I will remain until,
likely, the release of EQ3 :ï¿½)

I want more damage output, my choice is new weapons or new
haste...but...According to what I have read my haste is capped at 84% until
59th and with my RBG and AQ (which I am rarely without) my haste is 91%. For
this reason I don't see a need for the CoCW that was on my shopping list.
Next my weapons...I saw the Fleshgrinder and thought that looked good, can
afford on (have about 65k) and maybe a Snowchipper. I currently use 2
Bloodpoints and if my Dex was always 230ish, as it is with Boon of Garou,
then I would not want to uprade but...Boon of Garou isn't usable all the
time (or at least isn't safely usable all the time) and without it the procs
are just not frequent enough against the level of mobs I need to fight for
Exp.

So, any suggestions? Am I correct about the Haste cap or did I not
read/understand it correctly?
