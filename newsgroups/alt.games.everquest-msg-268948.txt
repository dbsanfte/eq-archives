Is this possible?

I just spent hours collecting the parts together to create elm boxes. This 
included pristine elm planed lumber, pristine tin caps, pristine tin sheets. 
I had 5 of each of these but simply couldnt create a single pristine elm 
box!

This is SO frustrating. The credit is classed as very easy but I simply 
cannot make a prstine box. I am hitting all the buttons that come up during 
the process. If a minor problem appears I hit the button once, if a major I 
hot it twice.

I just don't get it at all, what more can I do. The system seems so random, 
it's infuriating especially as I am spending so long collecting the parts 
etc.

Another thing I dont understand is how I improve my skills. For example I 
think one of the skills listed in making elm boxes is feltching, what can I 
do to improve this? Is there a progress bar to see how much more I need to 
improve it until it gets to the next level?

Aghhhhh too many questions and the manual is useless.
