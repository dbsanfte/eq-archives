Hello everyone.

I am wondering, what is the average rate of experience per hour for
everyone.  I have a level 52 Bard.  For levels 30-50 I was managing a
yellow bubble of experience in an hour, so I would manage to gain a
level in five hours /played.  When I hit 51, I noticed the experience
really slowed down.  I mostly solo because I can only manage to get in
for about an hour or so a few days a week.  I'm guessing I do a yellow
bubble of experience in about an hour and forty minutes.  Is that a
slow rate?  Would I get better experience per hour if I'm grouping?  I
do not have LDoN so those dungeons are not an option for me at this
time.  I guess I'm looking to get an idea as to what I should be
aiming for.  I'm currently hunting in Dulak where in certain areas the
mobs are dark blue to me.

I tried PoD when I was level 49 and I thought the mobs (rats) were
much too difficult for the experience and loot I was getting.  Perhaps
my songs will lands with a bit more consistency now that I'm level 52.
