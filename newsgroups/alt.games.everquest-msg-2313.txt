Pure casters, by which I take it you mean int casters, have FAR fewer
spells to concern themselves with than a shaman (enchanters are somwhat
close, bards closer still). My shaman has almost 50 spells that I regularly
switch between. Arranging them in the spellbook is a painful chore, and I
am constantly fiddling with it. I've no idea how people got by when the
spellbook couldn't be re-arranged.
