It is irrelevant - its bad design to have GMs blithely running in and
fixing stuff like this in game - Martin's case is an explicit example of
why it falls apart and why there should be something coded in to fix this
eg a /consent option or a longer timer to release so it stops being
relevant.

I used the word 'should' there for a reason. I was commenting not on what
system is being used currently but how it would best be fixed
properly....and having GMs come in and manually dealing with this
ninjaloot is a bad idea. Its a ninjaloot and that needs properly dealing
with - that the system being dealt with out of game and current offenders
dealt with in game by the community of players seeing the offender and
essentially blanking him for help etc...if they dont want people looting
other peoples corpses they need to do it properly not some section in
the play nice policy essentially saying 'oh yes, you can do this, but no
we dont think you should).....

Looking back at my first post I think I see where there may be a problem -
when Im talking about rolling beforehand and disengaging I was looking at
that as being a guild response to the realities of the current situation -
I dont think I made that plain at all...this was a case of ugly
practicality of 'you know it might happen'. 

Ultimately as I said if they stick a time on there that is an issue then
it shouldnt be dealt with by adding to the play nice policy and running
GMs in (it blocks any form of roleplaying for an RP server, it essentially
says oh ignore the fact we designed your system to allow this we might
arbitrarily decide not to let  it happen on a case by case system, causes
aproblem for PvP server code and again doesnt solve the problem as MArtin
has found out the hard way), if you want to change the way the game
ruleset works it needs changing properly, not hauling GMs around.

Even if Martin's guild get the item back and the ninja looter gone, the
issue is still there and unresolved for future people, they have wasted a
lot of time and hassle to themselves for something that if looting others
corpses is supposed to be permission based still isnt actually solved.

The issue is poorly solved and the ninjaloot prohibition in the PNP and
dragging GMs in isnt good design either from a roleplaying game
perspective or from a computer game perspective - its high on manhours,
its high on player frustration.
