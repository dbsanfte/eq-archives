This is incorrect.  The level-based damage bonus is a fixed number added
to your damage on each swing while the base damage of the weapon is
factored along with your Offense skill, Weapon skill, level, STR, the
AC of your target, and the ever-present RNG (random number generator)
to produce a random value between 1 (or 2 for 2H weapons) and your max
damage for the weapon.  When I've parsed fights for melees between L20
and L50 I have found that the average damage per hit is very close to:
(((max + 1) / 2) * 0.8) + ((base * 2) * 0.2) + bonus
[use (max + 2) instead of (max + 1) for 2h weapons]
Where max is the highest damage result seen minus the damage bonus.
This assumes "normal" opponents, i.e. high blue to yellow cons up thru
your upper 30s or so and mostly blue cons above L40.  Opponents with
unusually high or low AC will skew your hits towards the low and high
end of the range respectively.
The key to making use of this is to have a good idea what the ratio
between your max damage (highest hit - damage bonus) and your base
damage.  In my experience, for a low strength (100ish) melee your max
is close to 3x base at L40, slightly less at lower levels, slightly
more as you level thru your 40s.  Warrior, Ranger, and Rogue gain more
than knights do thru their 40s because they have higher skill caps.
With a high STR (180+) a Warrior can exceed 3x base as early as L20.

The upshot of all that rambling is that for a low strength melee I've
found that, prior to L51, I could get a reasonable comparison between
weapons using the formula:
((base * 1.5) + bonus) / delay
while with my Ogre Warrior (STR 186 unbuffed, has Shaman partner)I use:
((base * 2) + bonus) / delay
when considering weapons.

With my one post-50 character, a non-raiding L55 Paladin, I just went
with the best deal I could find in the bazaar.  In general there was
never more than one affordable weapon that clearly outclassed what I
already had.  I can say that as I moved up throught the low 50s I
found the above approximations to underestimate my damage somewhat.
I never have tried to work out a good approximation for the post-50
damage tables, just as I never did anything with Monk damage.
