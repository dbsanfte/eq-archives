It heals more, for a higher mana usage.

Look at the mana/heal on Greater heal to Remedy, or Divine Light etc

Isnt that the same as a cleric switching over from Remedy to Divine light as
they level a bit?

Now where did all those druids whining they have no usable raid buffs go? :p

1 downside is its 3 spells, as opposed to casting one.. but if you guys dont
have group aego/mass group buffs then it wont really be an issue i guess
