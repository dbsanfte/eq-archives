Fine.  Take your purile swipe at the player, pat yourself on the back for
beating a broken system, and move on to your next opportunity to..  Um?  
What, again?  Tell someone to fuck off, again?  As if this "'fag' on
ignore"  player would EVER change if you paid him back in kind?

All you've demonstrated is that petitions of obscenity will have no
in-game effect.  You haven't demonstrated that pouring more obscenity on
the situation will improve anything one iota.  If that's the case, then
the original poster was right to simply complete logging out.

That is, unless that 1% you quote comes up.  My way, there's a zero
percent chance that suspention will impact play time.  Your way, the zero
becomes non-zero.

Nobody's asking you to parent other people's children.  But more 
certainly, no one is looking to you to teach them that if they don't watch 
their children, assholes will come out of the woodwork to school them that 
life is nasty, brutish, and short -- all for a brief, meaningless thrill.
