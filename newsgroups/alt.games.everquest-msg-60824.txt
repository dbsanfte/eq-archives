Ah.

Well, I did some running around this evening (gah, this morning) and
completed the "bone chip" quest a few times over (collected 16 bone shards
and gave the bits to the Cleric Guild in Felwithe.  I didn't get a noticable
XP bump, but I got some cash and some faction, plus I sold them their
scrolls back at a tidy profit so that was nice.

I asked about becoming an "[Initiate of Tunare]" and was told to go to
Homicide Woods, erm, Lesser Faydark and bring 'em back some Ghast hearts.  I
might give that a go.

All this is to say that I'm really giving it the old college try - Heck, I
spent my dough on the game, I might as well keep plugging away - and I
actually got a sense of satisfaction out of bringing in the bits and pieces
for the Cleric's guild.

I scoped that first link.  Good stuff there, just skimming it.

No thanks - having been "doing usenet" as a drug of choice for 8 years now,
I've seen all 31 Flavors of idiotic flames out there, so I'll let's keep
this friendly :-)
