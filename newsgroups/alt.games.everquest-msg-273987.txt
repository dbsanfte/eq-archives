It's true that it's the social interaction that makes EQ.  I have a
couple of fond memories of Velious, all centered around a mob that
dropped an "etched stone mace" (I think).  I dropped that guy a couple
of times, very much spur of the moment (we were just fighting there
off and on) and one player was so grateful she gave a very nice
necklace after a touch and go fight.  Another time some player came up
to me and asked me about the mace and then said "I'll buy that off
you" and I had the pleasure of for once having "cool gear" (of course,
I didn't sell, I still have that mace in the bank, although it's been
years since I used it).

This was pretty much why I didn't raid.  The last time I went on a
raid, the server died right a few minutes before I was getting ready
to head out... meaning the next time I logged in I was going to
appear, alone, deep in a dungeon, surrounded by mobs.  We had no idea
when the server would come back up, I had work the next day, and I was
not staying up all night because of what's supposed to be a fun game.

The happy ending was that my wife did stay up, she logged into my char
and got me out, so the next more all was cool and I was in a happier
mood.  But getting into situations where you either MUST stay online
or suffer the loss of all the gear you've spent 5 years accumulating
is NOT fun, unless you are an extreme masochist.

But there IS an alternative to raiding. At  least up to level 19 in
WoW, there is a quest driven plotline.  Essentially WoW has melded
being in a "real world" with other players, and the plotline of a solo
game.  What typically has happened so far is that as you do quests,
you meet up with a few other people doing the same quest, join forces,
complete the quest and move on.  

The game is more social because there are not huge penalties for
failure.  There are still people that you don't want to play with
because of their antics, but there isn't a huge penalty for making the
wrong choice.  I can sign on quickly, play for an hour, have some fun,
and sign off again.  In EQ, it might take me an hour just to get set
up with a group and start playing.  It had gotten to the point in EQ
where I really felt like I had to have a block of 3 hours to "play" in
order to sign on...
