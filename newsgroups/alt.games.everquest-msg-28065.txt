Ahh, that's an easy one my friend...

Fear Kiting a Monk Boss:
Pull him somewhere safe (I like the pub, you can collect office gossip to
turn in at the office water cooler for faction)
Slow him down (if you are young, get a high level player to buy some tequila
for you, works a dream)
Now here comes the tricky part.
You need a level 1 shaman with 'Flash of light' to get a photo of the boss
flirting with the company secretary. This is your DOT.
Post it on the office intranet or send it to the local newspaper. If the DOT
does full damage but he's still walking you need to use your photoshop skill
(Mine is 198) to make it's damage output more significant, then reapply it.
Now sit and med in your cubicle and wait for the damage to eat away at his
career and before you know it he'll be cleaning floors.

Common loot:
Mont Blanc fountain pens
Company credit card

Uncommon loot:
Bosses BMW

Rare loot:
Picking up where the boss left off with the secretary.
Promotion to his position.

Faction Information:
-bosses family +office prankster +boys down at the pub.

If your boss is a monk then be careful, mine sometimes quad attacks with
"Unpaid overtime" so keep an eye on that.
Hope that helps =)
