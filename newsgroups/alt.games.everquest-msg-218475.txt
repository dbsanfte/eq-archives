Ok ,first humans and Barbarians are night blind .Would it be so bad if  they
could have a light source? After dying they could grab a light from the
nearest torch  it would be a "no drop" "no rent" light source just to get to
the corpse.Much like in real life if you would grab a twig and light it with
the torch.Also I brought this up earlier about rogues.They have detect traps
why cant they set traps?At like 9th level you would "earn" a trap kit
(through a quest)and you could make a trap.My idea of a "first level " trap
would be to gather a 'burned out lightstone'+2-'bone chips'+scarab shell
then combine. You will have so much time when you combine till you use it or
it will become a "dud".But if you place it by a mob ,by using sneak , then
back stab run back and the mob walks over the trap it will work like a 4th
level fire dmg spell.
What say you?
