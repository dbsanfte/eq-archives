sigh... I stopped playing my druid and started leveling an enchanter
because it was hard to get higher level groups.  Some people are just
ignorant.  I was in group where the leader wanted to pick up a druid
for extra healing, snaring, etc and one of the members gave him the
"why would you want a druid" line.  I just said "healing, blasting,
snaring, rooting, chloro,....".  Eventually, thank the lord, that guy
dropped out, we got our druid and had a good time.

As I said, some people are just ignorant.
