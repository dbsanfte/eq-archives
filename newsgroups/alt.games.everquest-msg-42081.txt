Thanks to all those who replied to my previous question about playing a
rogue.

Next question...

Do skills related those related to others?

For example, if my character has whatever-skill-level in hand to hand, does
it affect your one handed slashing, piercing, etc. Not increase the skill
level but does it make it more effective.

Thanks in advance
Jenn
