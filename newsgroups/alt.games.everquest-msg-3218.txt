I was just thinking the other day when I had 5 deep water caiman corpses
lying around me and their meat just sitting there, "Why can't I eat
those crocs?"  Well, the obvious answer is that then you would never
have to buy food.  But, I think this should be changed.  When you buy
food or drink from a merchant, I wouldn't ever worry about the quality
of merchandise.  But you know what, disease is a real thing and animals
carry diseases.  I think they should imbue certain pieces of meat with
disease so that you can eat as much meat as you want but if you eat rat
meat, you're going to get sick a hell of a lot more often then if you
eat cooked crocodile meat.  Wouldn't that be a great addition to RP.
You could go hunting for your food.  And if you didn't cook it well, you
could get sickened an lose STA, STR, HP, maybe your vision could darker
in the worst cases of disease.  It would add a risk and a benefit to the
game.

AND on team PVP servers, you could add a new quest, it would only be
available when a rare NPC spawned and only rogues could do it but you
could poison the water supply of a nearby enemy town.  Anyone buying
food or drink from the town has a chance of getting sick from it.  I
think it'd be cool, but feel free to tear me apart and leave my meat
lying around since you can't eat,
