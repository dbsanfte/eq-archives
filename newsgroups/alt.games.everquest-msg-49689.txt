Thanks.  My biggest concern right now, (besides whether the game would be
well-nigh unplayable due to potential developers' mistakes), is whether or
not my own system and connection can handle it.

Right now, the best I can get over my phone line is 26.4k   My video card
isn't the hottest, either, to say the least.  Right now any further upgrades
on my system and/or connection just isn't in the budget.

My next biggest concern is time.  For me to choose DAoC, means leaving EQ
completely, as I don't have time to play both.  I play with some people I
know personally, and they are sticking with EQ for the time being.  That,
and I genuinely enjoy EQ, and would have a hard time justifying leaving it
simply to join 'the new kid on the block.'

Still, the concept of DAoC's semi-historical fantasy background (Albion,
Hibernia, & Midgard) sounds more appealing to me than the Norrathian mythos.
