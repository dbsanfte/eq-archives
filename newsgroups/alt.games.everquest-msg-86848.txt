It will already tell you how many times YOU got summoned, but doesn't break
it out by mob, or tell you how many times other people got summoned.

Plus, if you're too far away, you won't get the message that someone else
has been summoned, or the "You will not evade me" message when you get
summoned.

I've been thinking about something like that, though.  Along with flurry
and enrage.
