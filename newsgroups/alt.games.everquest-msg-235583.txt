You *might* be able to solo some in Natimbi, but that will be about
it. Mobs in GoD hit VERY hard. Really... VERY hard. They dont have
insane hitpoints, but did I mention they hit really hard? ;) This
expansion doesnt seem very geared for soloers - as most of the zones
will be very hands off, but some resourceful soloers might be able to
a little. At least thats my opinion thus far. Single groups of mid 60s
seen to do ok, but alot of the content seems geared for higher end
raiding. Ive been in one instanced zone so far (some sewers in Berudi
(sp?) and most of the stuff there wasnt snareable and hit for up to
1200 a pop and some AE rampage.

At this point, you probably will be dissapointed with GoD, unless you
are really into tradeskills (as there are some tradeskill quests in
Abysmal sea) or can really use some of the new features or AA
abilities.
