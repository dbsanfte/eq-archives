}I was wondering if you knew(or anyone else) what the acronym "MQ" means -
}??? quest?

MultiQuest.  When a quest requires 2 or more items for completion, more 
than one character can hand in items to complte the quest, with the last 
person to hand in an item receiving the quest benefit.

For example, Velious armor quests require a piece of dropped unwearable 
armor and 3 gems.  One person who has the armor piece turns it in, and 
then the other person turns in the 3 gems.  The person handing in gems 
receives the finished quest armor.

Another example:  JBoots MQ seller hands Hasten Bootstrutter the Ring of 
the Ancients and the Shadowed Rapier, MQ buyer hands in 325pp.  Buyer 
receives Journeyman's Boots.  There is debate about whether the buyer 
should pay the seller his MQ fee up-front or upon receipt of goods.
