If it's something like this then no one will ever become Jedi, except
for those people working at Sony in the know...

I suspect that becoming a Jedi will be broken anyway, and they will just
say "oh yeah you can become one if you discover how"  Just like all the
broken quests in EQ. They say "just haven't been discovered yet."

Personally I think they would have done better to ballance it as a class
and just let people play one if they want, but make it freeking hard,
like you are always PKable and everyone knows which side you are on, and
that you are a Jedi.  Make is something like playing a bard in EQ,
really hard, but powerful at the same time.
