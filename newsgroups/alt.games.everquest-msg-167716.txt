Hmm... well, at 43, you could obviously pick up the hilt from Lake Rathe,
and the other hilt from Tim Deep.

As far as fights...  you are about the perfect level to camp the Giant
Patriarch at the fort in Dreadlands for the Giant Monocole.    Should be all
blues except maybe the man himself.

With a strong group, you *might* be able to do Ice Giants for the block of
permafrost, and you could definitely do Ice Goblin Wizards for the Heart of
Frost.  (or whatever it is called)

Other than that, not a whole lot.   Most of the warrior epic is very raid
centered, more than the other epic quests.
