Also dont forget (I think this is still the case, I tend not to group being
a youngen lvl 31 necro) that exp bonuses also apply to groups as well. A
full group will get more experience but it is obviously shared among the
group.
If you arent sure of a zones exact exp bonus maybe go by the difficulty of
an evac on foot. Somewhere like OOT gives more experience than somewhere
like the Karanas as evacs are not as simple as running to a zone.
I could be completly off the mark here but in the absence of the listing you
are after (which would be great if there is one out there!) this might be a
good way to guess.
Does anyone out there know if my little theory could be a possibility?
