And so would anyone else in the group, of course.  Throw
in that lower-level members get XP as long as they're
killing things that are blue (even if green to the
higher-level)..

Yep.

Mumble, mumble something like that...

Nope...

Used to be done that way...

C) Each mob has set XP dependant on the mob's level.
That XP is modified by the ZEM (Zone Experience
Modifier) and by the GEM (Group Experience Modifier)
Total XP is then divided by adding all the *levels*
in the group, with each person getting a fraction of
the XP that's equal to THEIR_LEVEL/TOTAL_LEVELS.  So
a 40 grouped with a 50 would get 4/9ths of the mob's
XP after ZEM and GEM.  A hybrid also gets any XP
earned modified to eliminate the old hybrid penalty
but that's essentially irrelevant for purposes of
this discussion.

It's split as in C, as far as I can tell.  They sure
don't get "solo XP" for it.  XP that would be given
to the players just gets ignored if the mob is green.
