They actually do go back to their spawn spot (at least the ones i have 
had problems with). Just wait 15 min and theyll move right back.
The problem is that if they are aggroed/hailed/rightclicked on will make 
the 15 min timer start over again, which means that some vendors (brew 
lady in WFP near NFP zone for example) can actually be more or less 
permacamped at the zone to NFP for days at a time, and if that happens, 
the only way to fix it are to kill her, or get a GM to kill her so shell 
respawn.
