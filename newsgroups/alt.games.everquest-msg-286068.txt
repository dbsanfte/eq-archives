If you want to compare it against other games of that age, try Diablo2 
(released in early 2000)
Threads for april... (spam included, sorry too much work omitting it)
alt.game.diablo2=139
alt.games.everquest=23

and thats not counting the separate threads in alt.games.diablo which are 
diablo2 related.

But feel free to keep defending eq/soe and insulting me if it makes you feel
