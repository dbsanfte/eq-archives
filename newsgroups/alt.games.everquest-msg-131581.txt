Hmm, that sounds like a plan, let me try to alter to fit cleric.

Ah, before loot is announced, I'll use my mighty lull line on the druids and
shaman.

Uh oh, resist, shit they are aggroed on me now!  DA DA DA running for
zone line with a DoT on damn this snare

Hmm, now I gotta get in there and drag my body somewhere safe so
I can rez myself.

Plan B.
/1 memming rez.
/2 bid 1 point on the UBERPRIESTITEM
/1 rezing chanter
/1 rezing bard
/1 rezing mage
/1 rezing ranger_01
/1 rezing ranger_02
/1 rezing ranger_03
/1 rezing monk
/1 rezing druid
/1 oops, oom
/2 better make a call quick, I think its about to rot
/1 rezing druid
/1 oops fizzle
/1 oom again
/2 ok looting
/1 need C3
/1 group that bard with me please
/1 mod rods please
/1 rezing druid
/1 rezing shaman
/1 rezing cleric_02

that should do it

Bergh Brelltender
59 cleric with a suspiciously tiny mana pool all of a sudden

/1 oh its cause I have my resist gear on instead of wiz/mana gear
yeah, thats the ticket
