Except for your orc fang earring, this stuff is really not that bad.

I'd start there. Go in the bazaar and do a search by your class and
race for earrings, with a price range of 300 to 9999999 (to cut out
some real crap.. like that orc fang.. AHHAHAHA ;)  )  You'd be
surprised to see that lately some recommended level okay droppable
ones from POP or something are on player vendors for a few k plat.

Otherwise, you have the right idea with the fairly high AC bp/legs and
arms until you get something better.

I'd maybe save some money and get a barbed ringmail, same ac but 50
hp, weeeee. Then sell the Acryilla bp.

Is umbral an option for bards for upgrades? I'd try grouping there if
it is/going with friends. Its probably the best bet for some armor you
don't have to quest.
