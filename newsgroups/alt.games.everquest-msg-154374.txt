True, but that's the same answer Enchanters got when they asked for more
illusions (which we've been doing for a very long while now). Then when the
global space opened up a bit it was decided that Illusion Spectre 'didn't
fit' for Enchanters even though it's in the global file now and Enchaters
already get Illusion Skeleton.

Mages already get a gate spell (being obvious here I know), what is a
self-gate? Is that something like a Translocate?

Actually I've been hearing that with PoP Enchanters are dead as a class.
I've seen that posted in more than one place. Something about being replaced
by Bards. Since my Enchanter is only 22'nd level PoP really doesn't effect
me much, at least not yet.

I think you're somewhat overstating what Enchanters are getting. KEI is a
rare drop from a very high level mob. I'll certainly never see it. And while
Dire Charm is nice it's already been nerfed once to be less effective.
Neither of those abilities come from PoP. Are Enchanters really getting all
that much from PoP? I don't see it myself. I mean Illusion Froglok at level
65? Why?

I won't disagree that Wizards need something. I could never play one long
enough to really get to understand the class. Too much much resisting, too
much sitting and too much dieing.
