I agree that the game has not unfolded the way the designers intended. They
thought people would just kill a spawn and move on instead of sit and wait
for it to repop! What I'm saying is that PvP is SUPPOSED to happen!
Religious war is supposed to happen! there is so much racial hatred in the
game its silly to just pass it off as "oh that must not be right if the
majority of players are pussies and choose the easy way out!"
