While this is true to a point, you have to admit that it was pretty much
LoTR that gave birth to (or at least *heavily* influenced) the current crop
of fantasy related movies/literature/games, going back to the 50's.  Yes, he
built on pre-established ideas from fantasy, but he put them together, and
more importantly popularized them, like no one else.

Saying Tolkien only invented the story line is not giving him *nearly*
enough credit.  He created a world like no one has before or since.
Creating the depth and history of Middle-Earth was his life's work.  This
included geography, languages, creation myths, and the histories of entire
races of beings.  He has been repeatedly borrowed from for half a century,
and EQ is no exception.
