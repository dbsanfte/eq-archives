From the ranger Top Ten issues list on EQLive....


Notes for Ranger top 10 issues list �
#1
� Bow � currently in the high end game bow DPS is too low compared to
melee DPS (Dev notes - This is how it should be. We want rangers to
use dual wielding as the combo of choice for all encounters. Range
attack offers little to no risk compared to being 10 feet away from an
NPC hacking and slashing.)


The dev is right of course. But note that... and then realize: the
ranger epic 2.0 is a *bow*.

The left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. And neither
hand knows what it *should* be doing either...
