True but meaning KEI below level X hurts everyones gameplay when infact for
most people it improves it.

Well depending on the group why not. Bards can do well with chanters.
Amazing how versatile a Bard can be.
But then again I have grouped with far more enchanters than bards. Bards
dwindle out the higher they go it seems.

Generally Yes. but nerfing KEI won't fix this. Many of my solo toons got
more exp soloing than grouping before KEI.

True. but crowd and "you" are completely different. Calling me part of the
NO NERF crowd is true and non personal.

Well for example I'll quote from above
"game.  For those few (like you apparently) who cannot grasp obvious
implications,"

Using the word you makes it personal.

Edited -- "game.  For those few who cannot grasp obvious implications,"

Is lumping me in with the few but is not personal.

IMO.
