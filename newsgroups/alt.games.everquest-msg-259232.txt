Funny you should mention this as just last night I was chatting with a 
friend and mentioned my characters seemed very slow compared to others. 
After completing her quest, four of us went to West Commons at the zone 
line to East Commons and ran to the Kithicor Forest zone line. All 3 of 
the others were about the same speed. We all used autorun. My character 
was very much slower than they were. I presume it must be the 
connection, I can't see certain character classes or races being made 
slower or faster on purpose, but I could picture Vah Shir being faster 
due to their evolution.
