I almost never give to beggers, but I recently went to GFay to clear out the
old gear from the banks of all my characters and there were almost no takers
for the low end stuff. Either they were too proud to come get it or it is
too low end even for level 1s now. The few people that did come even turned
their noses up or gave me a load of cheek about the items I offered them!

A couple of years ago there would have been a mad scrabble for anything :/
