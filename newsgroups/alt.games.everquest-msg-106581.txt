From the above description, these players were not true "newbies".
LoIO is not an easy zone to get to if you are not an Iksar. Someone
had to have led them there (friend who plays EQ PLing?). My guess is
that they were taken there as a prank, or by someone punishing them
for begging, or by a well meaning friend who was PL/twinking them.

After level 6 (10 now since you respawn with items) you have a week to
reclaim your corpse. CR is a harsh lesson no matter what level you
learn to deal with it. At level 10 most classes are MUCH better
equiped/skilled than at level 5. A newbie that has lost a corpse is
much more likely to get it back at level 10 than level 5.
