You say you're looking to level the mage, but you just mentioned a couple of
cash zones.  Which do you want, xp or cash?

If EXPERIENCE, go to any DUNGEON that's still dark blue, white and yellow to
the mage.  Nurga, Droga, SolA, SolB, LGuk all come immediately to mind.

As to your other question, if you're grouped and you have no tank, then the
earth pet can't be beat.  My level 50 earth pet has 2700hp UNBUFFED.  He's
been MT many times in small groups.  His root also comes in danged handy if
I've over-nuked & gotten aggro.
