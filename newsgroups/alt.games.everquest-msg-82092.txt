(chuckle) 13th. And I'm having serious withdrawal pains tonight! ;) I was
seriously considering driving to Tulsa this weekend where it's likely still
being shown! Yes, I recall that first story in Hearts in Atlantis. It was a
good one, but not one I could readily identify with (except lately, where EQ
has taken over my life ;)) But then, I have nothing pressing, since my knees
are screwed from the truck rollover...

Thank you, that would have made me nuts until I found the book again so I
could remember the name. I knew it was Tom <something> :)

I need to go have a look see at what he's currently got in the works.
Sometimes he still amazes me, after all these years. I doubt I'll *ever*
love another of his books as much as I did The Stand (The Shining is next!),
though. But one can hope that he still has it in him somewhere, another
wonderful read. Oh, have you read (memory bad...) the one he recently did
with Peter Straub? The Black... something? (hey, I got part of it right! ;))
(maybe) It was the followup to The Talisman.
