Nothing in the PNP says you have to help people out, just not get in their
way. I'm all for saving lives heroically, but...

Of course, I never ask for help and just run away when someone does - I
always try to help the helper unless I'm almost dead myself, I think it's
rude not to. Maybe he was just doing that. Maybe he wasn't. If he'd used
"please", it might have been the former.
