I certainly agree here.  Raids generally consist of one or two groups
getting all the exp from several groups worth of killing, which is often
more exp per hour than they would have gotten on an "exp  camp",
but its very rare to find a raid concerned about sharing the exp around.

The constant response is "raids aren't about exp" unless of course
you happen to be in the exp group.. then you stay real quiet and
pretend you can't see your exp bar, just hope you don't ding and
someone notices.

I do think you'd see more trouble setting this up than you think,
you wouldn't want exp on mobs to be shared up based on damage
done, say, or else clerics would (under normal circumstances) never
see any.  You wouldn't want it shared up equally, or you could
powerlevel people by putting them in raid mode with you and letting
them just suck up exp, since they aren't grouped with you.  I'm
not saying it can't be done, but you would need a fair and equitable
system for it that wouldn't make PLing too much easier than it is now.
