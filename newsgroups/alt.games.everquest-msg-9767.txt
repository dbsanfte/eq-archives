Yes definitely, If you want hardcore Ad&D get baldurs gate. If you want a
nice mixture of fantasy setting with a great interactive environment and
party system play everquest. It has a good Quest system and is geard towards
partying with others.

As an old Ad&D player I am looking forward to getting Pool of Radience but
im not sure if its multiplayer.

What I would like to see is a game using the Infinity engine as a MMORPG
with a nice solid questing and party system like Everquests.
