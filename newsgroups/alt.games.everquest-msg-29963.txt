Right -- you're at least supposed to have to trot after
the thing you've Feared as it runs screaming.

Along with adding the risk of running into other mobs,
it adds the problem of trying to keep up with it closely
enough to keep hitting it as it runs.

Or at least it encourages you to add a Snare-enabled class
to your group, because chasing a snared-feared mob is a hell
of a lot easier than chasing a feared mob that is running
full speed.

Fearing it into a corner just makes it too easy.

On the other hand, it can be amusing -- there's a room in
the basement in Kurn's Tower where, if you pull a Burynai
into it and either Fear it, or damage it enough so that
it runs, it runs to the corner of the room and stops there,
nose-first into the corner.

What's so funny about this is that the way Burynai hold
their arms out to their sides, their "hands" touch
the walls of the room, and with their heads bowed down
slightly, absolutely everyone I have shown this to (for
amusement value only) instantly says, "Blair Witch!"
