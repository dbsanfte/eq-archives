From L51 on you can then devote how much of your "normal" xp goes towards AA
or just leveling (0-100%). You have a seperate xp bar to show how many AAxp
you have before you "ding" and get ability points.

AAxp seems to gain at about L50 xp rate no matter what level you attain it
at. You then use these "points" to buy the special AA abilities. There are 3
tiers of abilities, each requiring completion of the prior ones first. (So
you can't get Tier2 abilites without completing Tier1, and T3 requires T1 &
T2).

Check eq.castersrealm.com or www.everlore.com for more details or just about
any other site about classes will do too.
