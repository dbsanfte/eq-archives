    It's only because of one spell that was a design error that a cleric is
100% effective: CH. Without CH, the cleric doesn't really keep up with the
higher DPS of higher level mobs, and isn't as effective as the higher-level
cleric. It's the same as the plate tank - he won't be useless, but he sure
won't be contributing much damage and his ability to tank will be
diminished. Again, the reason was a design error that the devs wish they
could erase, but which thankfully still exists. I say "thankfully" because I
doubt the devs could have found a good role for clerics otherwise.
