Several others have recommended GigaNews, and I agree with that
recommendation. I've been with them several months now, and their
service is cheap (~$10 per month), fast and reliable.

I was trying to go through "all-in-one" ISP services for a long time,
and discovered that folks who try to do everything rarely do any of it
well. I've gone a la carte for all my internet services now.
