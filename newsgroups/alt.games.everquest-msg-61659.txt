Drop a clarity on a level 10 wizard and see if he ever needs to
sit down to med for the next 20 minutes, especially if hunting
blues.  By the time you find something to kill, your mana is back...
2 nukes, time to find another blue.

Mana regen rate is MUCH more unbalancing if left uncontrolled
than simple haste.  I don't care how much you haste a warrior,
a warrior isn't going to solo a dragon.  A shaman HAS soloed
a dragon, and that was WITHOUT some kind of weird mana
converter (besides his own spells).

Imagine a druid/necro that didn't have to med?  What, level
50 in a week without  powerleveling...
