I guess "Duh" is the extent of your answer.

I wonder if Sony's lawyers were in court and the judge asked them "Why do
you believe that selling computer game cash is illegal?", the head of Sony's
high priced legal team would rise and say to the judge "Because dollars ARE
real. Duh"

Ok... tell me how real life cash differs in any significant way from
platinum pieces, that shows it does not exist. For example, you might say
"Well, you can't fold it into a roll, and impress the girls".... and I would
answer "Well, there are a lot of things you can't do that to, yet they
exist"... and so on.

Feel free to use your "duh" argument if you wish, after all, it has been the
most compelling one so far.
