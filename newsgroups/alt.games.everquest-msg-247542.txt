Well according to sony.........  There is no camps and if your a high lvl
not getting xp and people show up to get xp then they have the right to be
there and ask u to leave.......... being you can rezz a GM to ask u to
leave.  Now I don't think this is right but that is why I play on a pvp
server, sorta makes you earn your camp if u wanna keep it.
