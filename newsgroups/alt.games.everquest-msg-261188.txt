So, I'm looking forward to losing my static party in Final Fantasy to 
this WoW thingy, and the stress test beta... well it impressed me, it 
needs some polish but they have the fundamentals down...

But I'm not interested.

So while Final Fantasy may hold my interest a while longer, I'm thinking 
about the way back... to a familiar place, EverQuest...

I've got a 55 enchanter with a small pile of cash (sold off my gear when 
I quit in case I came back, the plat would likely be worth more than the 
stuff) who doesn't particularly enjoy soloing. (Got tons of 30-40s alts 
too... but always go back and play the enchanter)

I have all expansions up to and including Legacy of Yeshka.

I like crawling through dungeons.
I like companionship and the challenge of making a group work like a 
well oiled machine.
I like pushing my own envelope.. 10 inc? cleric better keep an eye on me.
I'm not in a hurry to go anywhere though it seems... I am only 55. (I do 
have several 30-40ish alts.)
My machine has gone through two upgrade cycles since I left, and I am 
planning to trickle in new parts in the next 6 months. Currently 3 ghz, 
radeon 9600 pro, 1.5 GB ram.
I'm not really the 'raid' type. I've been told I do it well, but I 
really don't have the hours to devote, or the desire.

So if I were to wander back into the game, which expansions should I 
pick up?

And does anyone think a better move might be to clear off my bazaar 
mule, delete him, start over and just do a twink dump of all my cash?

Hmm never really played a necro... I dunno. I could even enjoy an 
enchanter from scratch again... I think.

This may all be speculation... by the time WoW comes out the glamor may 
have worn off, and I may not lose my buddies. Even if I do I think they 
may well be back... None of them are really the endgame-raider or PvP 
type, and unless there is a brick wall somewhere ahead... well... I hit 
17 in about 3 serious days of playing. One guy was 24 and his cable was 
down 2 days. They will cap out and not have anything to do in 2 months I 
bet.
