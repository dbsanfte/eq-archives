I soloed my Mage alot from level 28 upto 43, where I am now.  I also
"duoed" with my friend's Mage who was 2 levels above me.  What I liked
about those experiences was the ability to just explore around instead
of just camping and waiting, killing, waiting...  

We (my friend and I), "discovered" KEI about 3 months ago, and we have
been using it ever since.  Though it is very nice - offering what is
close to infinite mana - we'll just go back to what we were doing
before, waiting alot more.

I personally think the level requirement for KEI is a good move.  A
month ago I was playing my little level 15 Froglok Cleric in Crush
Bone when one of our group left to refresh their KEI!  I thought that
level 12, which is what that player was, was a little early to require
KEI to play the game.  I guess it could have been jealousy as I pay
10-15pp for KEI, and cannot afford it with my Frog.

I always liked Breeze and Clarity, and guess that I, like others, will
be looking for Chanters to group with.
