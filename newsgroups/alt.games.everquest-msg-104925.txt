    Eeep! /jump

    Oh, wait - we're not in the zone that scares me, Siren's Grotto. Whew!

    The key is "anytime soon". ES tunics have been coming into the world on
your server ever since people started killing Trakanon, and I bet he's been
killed once per week since. And there's better tunics for a druid out there.
Ditto the Lodizal Shell Shield - every 18 hours since Velious release
Lodizal has a chance of being up, and there's a lot of other cloaks that
people prefer to it (lack of HPs and MANA make it less than optimal to
some). That earring beats every other droppable earring I've seen, and most
of the No Drop ones, too.

    Having said that, a guildmate bought one in EC recently. When he heard
that the person only wanted 20 K for it he nearly broke his fingers typing
"SOLD" as fast as he did.

    If she levels up fast enough, she can farm them herself - solo! :-)
