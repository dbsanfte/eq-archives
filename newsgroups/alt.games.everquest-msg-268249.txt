A week or so ago, I picked up Knights of the Old Republic (KOTOR), a 
single player RPG set in the Star Wars universe.

Just finished it a few minutes ago.

Comparing this to my years of playing EQ, two things strike me.

1) Wow, it was amazing to actually finish something.  And there was a 
story arc to it.  I could have pushed that arc a lot of ways, I probably 
will go back and play it a few more times in order to try out other 
directions.  But compare to EQ, where the "arc" was "I get more 
powerful, and then I get more powerful... and nothing really changes"

2) Damn, sucks to finish something.  With EQ, I paid 50 bucks for a 
game, and 12 or so a month, and played it for many many many more hours 
than I'll ever hope to play KOTOR.  I might replay KOTOR a few times, 
but it will never be as good as the first time, -because- of that story 
arc... I know, more or less, what the surprises are.

I strongly suspect I'll be paying more money, and averaging less 
enjoyable games, buying single player than I did all those years of EQ; 
I remember how many games look good on the shelf but really arent all 
that much fun...

Lance, DLotS
didn't see that coming!
