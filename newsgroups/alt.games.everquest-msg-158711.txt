This is what I've always thought was one of the Jobs of the Tank, be the
last to run. There is only one "Hero" in the party, the mug in the platemail
that has shouting bad "Ya Mother" insults at his antogonists.
He/She then tries to get as far from aggro as possible to die, for an easier
CR.
Can't say it works so well at 50+ (tanks prolly down before "Run" is yelled)
but under 40 I'd expect it.
