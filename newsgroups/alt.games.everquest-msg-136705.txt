I agree for the most part.  After a while, though, the same old run becomes
more tedium than "adventure."  After you've mastered the run from Qeynos to
Freeport, what is gained by repeating it over and over?

<tongue in cheek>I think every character over 35 should be able to port.
And I think paladins should get Complete Heal, since we're not good
maintanks, and are useless in raids.  And we should be able to dual wield,
as well. </t-i-c>

Well, think about it, the ghoulbane may not be much now, at higher levels,
but can you imagine camping the FG, dual wielding Ghoulbanes, with
Instrument of Nife on both?

You slash a Frenzied ghoul for 35 points of damage.
A Frenzied Ghoul is hit for 30 points of non-melee damage.
You begin to cast Condemnation of Nife.
A Frenzied Ghoul is hit for 150 points of non-melee damage.
You slash a Frenzied ghoul for 35 points of damage.
A Frenzied Ghoul is hit for 30 points of non-melee damage.

A Frenzied Ghoul is hit for 150 points of non-melee damage.
A Frenzied Ghoul cries out "For the love of Innoruk, just take the damn
sash!"
A Frenzied Ghoul runs away sobbing.
