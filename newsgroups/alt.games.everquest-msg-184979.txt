One night a friend asked me to help him out in Kith, I didn't have to
work the next day so I stayed up and helped out. My job was to pull
the Dark Elves and bring them back to the Rivervale entrance.

Once I found my way around, and with the help of a cleric to Lull the
first bunch I set up for the last pull. Off I went, deep into Kithikor
forest in the dead of night.  I get to the camp and end up walking
right up to the guy, he didn't argo. Tryed attacking him. Nothing. My
group is telling me to pull and I tell them, I can't attack anything.
I then get challanged to a duel. I look around and no one is there.

Now here I am walking around the DE camp in Kith like I was the scum
of the earth cause they didn't want to have anything to do with me,
when all of the sudden.......


YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED


I come back in and I am standing at the Rivervale entrance, No wheres
near where I went LD. Upon getting back into the group and chatting
about what happened. It appears that in their views I never moved at
all. Now, I know this was a good 5 minutes, with me running to the
camp, trying to pull, talking with the group trying to figure out why
the DEs wouldn't have anything to do with me and so on.  So either is
was a really nasty LD bug, or I had played to much and fell asleep at
the key board and actually interacted with the group. For a humor
side, I'll go with option b LOL
