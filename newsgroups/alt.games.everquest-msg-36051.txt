Ok, here's my pearls of wisdom =)

Ctrl-S  this toggles your sit status (stand if sitting, sit if standing).
This is the easiest way for me to get ready to cast.

Ctrl-D  this disbands the group.  Due to the proximity of this to S, I
removed this from my hot key list so I don't indavertantly destroy the
group.

Alt-X  this casts spell X (Alt - 1 casts the first spell, etc...)  This is
nice for the rarely used spells that you have memmed (Gate) but don't want a
hotkey for.

Ctrl-X  as you said this selects group members.  I know of no way to order
the list, so you need to adapt to whatever group you are in.

Use your HP buff (Valor) to heal minor damage.  This also staggers the spell
around so that the whole party doesn't lose the buff at the same time during
a fight.

Make an /assist hotkey.  This is great for targeting the active mob (for
nukes/stuns) AND for assisting the Mob which makes your target the person
getting hit.  This is a nice way to see if a heal is required.  For example
you see your groupmate drop to 3 bubbles of health, normally time for a
Celestial Heal (very efficient heal over time).  But if the mob is now
targeting a different tank, you don't need that heal Now, you need to stay
ready incase something bad happens to its current target.  Most notably is
when the mob changes from a well armored Warrior to a squishy
enchanter/wizzy.

Try to keep "Stun" available.  As time goes on the spells a mob can cast
become the most dangerous aspect of a fight (Fear, Charm, Complete Heal,
Gate, etc....) so you need to watch for "NastyMob_01 begins to cast" and
immediatly fire the stun [for me that sequence is: F2 (or whatever member is
main assist), 2 (my assist hotkey), Ctrl-S (stand), Alt-3 (stun), Ctrl-S
(Sit), 2 (assist mob back to who its fighting) ]

One more thing, with your hotkeys, you need a pause after the /cast or it
will try to sit while casting.  And to stand in a hotkey use /sit off.
