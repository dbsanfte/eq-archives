Was not making any claims as to why it was the case, just mentioning it, 
as we have someone who regularly parses our raid targets.  We have one 
ranger who is a serious ATK fiend, and he is always at the top of the 
list, generally by a huge margin.  Yes, he is using a stonewood compound 
bow, but, to be fair, we actually can make these ourselves from drops we 
get.  Aside from him, the "DPS" classes are generally grouped fairly 
close together in damage done.  Admittedly, we don't yet have much in the 
way of other elemental weapons yet.  So, I'd have to say, where rangers 
stack up DPS wise has a lot to do with where you are at in the game 
progression.
