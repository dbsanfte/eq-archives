Today is my day off  and I usually spend it playing EQ...

Also, the game ran just fine last night.

However, after downloading the new patch this morning, each time I click the
'I accept' button on the User Agreement page, I keep getting a warning
screen stating something like:

"Error opening file eqfeart8.pak!"

Then it's back to the desktop  : (

Any suggestions, please?

Respectfully,


Cold Turkey in Montrï¿½al
