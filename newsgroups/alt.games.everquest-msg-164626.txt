Snip.

Your entire post of the original owner getting the account back is
exactly why verant does not support account transfer and why you
should not do it. You bugging verant about something which is not
their problem just cements their reason for not allowing it.

Your largest mistake was not just buying the account to remove the
loot then delete the character. This is the only reason I'd buy a
character from anyone. Then after you bought it and took all its gear,
you delete it. If they ever try to contact you, then you say "But I
bought the character so why'd you log on it and know that its gone?"

Finally what this really is, in spite of verant or a eula, is wire
fraud. The people you want to contact are the FBI or US postal service
or something. If the mail was used in committing this fraud at all its
postal fraud. This is federal stuff and can ream the person. This is
what you should be looking into. If you used paypal for the transfer
they can do something about it also probably.
