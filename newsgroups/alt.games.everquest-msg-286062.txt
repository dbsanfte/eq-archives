My apologies for posting a question about current content instead
of jumping on the bandwagon with all the folks moaning about the
lack of such posts. :-)

My high-50s trio has started exploring Acrylia Caverns, which is
one of the new hotzones.  I know that SOE has been adding new mobs
and such to each of the last few sets of hotzones, but I was still
a bit startled by the drop we got: one of the "skeletal minions"
dropped a bunch of summoned pet gear!  (Two blades, muzzle of mardu,
and lucid belt.)

Has anyone else seen this?  And a related question: could this have
been due to someone charming the skeleton and equipping it, then
breaking the charm?  (I thought that summoned gear didn't come back
even if you later killed the mob, but could be misremembering.)

	-- Don.
