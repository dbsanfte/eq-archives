Nobody's -really- enforcing it.  But bottom posting is still the suggested 
norm.  In a moderated newsgroup, it could be enforced, and sometimes is, 
by cancelling top poster's posts.

Right.  When there's a Hebrew USENET, I expect the posting standard will 
involve posting text running from right to left.  But this isn't Hebrew, 
is it?

Interesting statistic.  Where is it from?  I suspect the vast majority of 
the internet's traffic is to and from countries where the native tongue is 
read from left to right, and top to bottom.

>Example, USA has a speed limit of what is it now 75?

It varies by state, now.  I think Montana was found to have the most 
forgiving current speed laws.  It used to be 55... So pokey!

>I've had the 
>pleasure of a Lamborghini and 160.  Can you enforce this 75 on me?

No, a police officer can, if you drve your 'ghini at a higher speed in a 
zone posted for a lower speed.  How's this relevant?

From merriam-webster:

guideline: b: an indication or outline of policy or conduct.
rule: 1a: a prescribed guide for conduct or action.

Do those really seem all -that- different to you?

No, the RFCs are not absolute law.  But they are generally accepted to be 
good guidelines -and- rules to determine internet standards.

Ah, that would be the not-so-obvious enforcement you're ecountering, then.  
Now that you know the real penalty for violating the rules, do you still 
feel it's such a grand idea to?

Aye, me too.  Well, I was in Berkeley, not NM, but hey.

It's always possible.  But consider also that if you -had- checked the 
FAQ, you may not have needed to ask the question, even.

I dunno, I've seen girlfriends of quite advanced ages.  My dad's GF is 
old enough to be my mother, even. :)  Try putting the lid down more, see 
where it gets you. :)

For the sake of the rarer good attitudes, perhaps.

I'm not.  I claim only that the readers -do- have some right.

Hmm.  You seem to be conforming to some 'rule' about not saying 'bullshit' 
in newsgroups...  I haven't come across that one anywhere...

Nope, currently I pretty much read this one, and 3-4 that have zero 
non-spam traffic.  Eventually, someone will post something fascinating in 
alt.food.pez, I just know it!  I have visited quite a few, over the years, 
though.

Well.  That may be the standard in that group.  I'd check their FAQ.  Of 
course, it's also possible the guy criticizing you was just an asshole.  
that seems more likely, really. :)

Yea, well, I'll probably switch to a new address sooner or later.  But 
interestingly, I think most of my spam at this address originated from 
using ebay, and not USENET.

Of course, you could always just get a dummy yahoo address to post from...

Thank you, I'm glad you like it. :)
