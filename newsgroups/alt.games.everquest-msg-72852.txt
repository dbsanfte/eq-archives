Yes, keep both 1hs and 1hb up...much easier than buying an Iksar
Berserker club at level 46 to work on your 1hb skill of (4). :-)

Put the Tombcarver off-hand until your DW maxes out for the level,
then switch to your sword to max out 1hs.  After 1hs maxes out,
switch back to the Tombcarver until your next ding.
