Hehe, strangely enough, once in a while when i refuce to port someone in 
EQ, im told i sound very young, guess that some kind of self defence

Errrr, you should try to read the NG some more. Bizbee and DT do bitch 
sometimes, yes, but they also contribute positively to the discussions 
in here.
Wbrownlee only started to post here a few months ago, and im pretty sure 
this is her first big bitching, so you obviously dont read this group 
enougn.
