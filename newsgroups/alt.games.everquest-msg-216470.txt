200 would have been a reasonable guess, and to be honest when this
first came about I think my main was 36 at the time (I was so hoping
for that arrow).  When it wasn't there I kind of assumed a 200 was
needed, I was happy to find out it isn't.
The Loc system was good, this is true, but I did used to use EQAtlas
and sense heading a lot.  I usually knew where I was, and what direction
I needed to go.  The addition of the compass helped too because then
I could line up a better heading.
Now I almost never use Loc anymore, almost never use EQAtlas
anymore.  Its mostly the in game maps.  Kinda sad, those EQAtlas
maps were so well done.
