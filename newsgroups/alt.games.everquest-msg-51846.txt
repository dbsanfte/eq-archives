I made sure I pointed out that I didn't buy plat, I think its more fun to
trade my way up then to just buy it, but I have no problem with those who
do. Someone who has 2 hours to play a week is going to have more fun with
10k he bought then trying to struggle his way up to getting good gear, as he
doesn't play enough to make many friends.
