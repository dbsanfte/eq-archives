}IME its those older, wiser and more experienced who tend to ask. 

Yep, that mostly matches my experience with it.  And yes, the older, 
wiser, more experienced player is far less likely to beg.  But I thought 
of another thing that tends to happen right after inspection that seemed 
to be uniform across all levels... or at least, go up to much higher 
levels than begging does.

It's why I changed the litte text description in my inspect window to say 
"I'm male.  Deal with it."
