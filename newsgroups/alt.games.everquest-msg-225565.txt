Very easy to find out if your problems are heat related: take the case off
and see if things improve at all. It is getting towards 30 degrees here
during the day so the first thing I did when these lockups started was to
run caseless. No change - still the same lockups.

My Athlon 1200Mhz is a hot chip to as it is the last of the Thunderbirds and
I also suspect there is a little more than healthy thermal resistance
between the chip and heatsink as well but I have been too lazy to reseat
it - consequently I keep a very careful eye on heat levels and there have
been nothing unusual to catch my eye lately.
