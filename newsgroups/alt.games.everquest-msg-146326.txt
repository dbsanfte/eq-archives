	Experience in outdoor zones sucks, period.  If you want real points, get
indoors.  Akheva is worth almost twice the experience of ME.

	Been there, done that, did better on the 'shrooms.

|Kael, various giants, ranging from low blues
|to high blues mostly (some greens too, but you get past them pretty
|quickly).

	I've only been to one Kael run in months, to reverse a CoV faction hit
taken at a public raid.

|The Grey, mostly blues, a few even cons near the temple.

	Outdoors again.  I soloed in the Grey on and off through 58 and 59, and
very occasionally in 60 if FG is swamped.  Not impressed.

|Fungus Grove, most, if not all blues, but, we did have a 60 ranger to do the
|pulling to get singles.

	Which is where I get the bulk of my experience these days.
