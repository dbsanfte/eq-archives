Note, there are now two "Plane of Air"s in the game.  There's
the original "Plane of Air" (also called "Plane of Sky"), which
has the zone file "airplane.s3d", and there's the new "Plane
of Air", with zone file "poair.s3d".

They're two different places.

Technically, the old PoA should be called "Plane of Sky" and
the new one "Plane of Air", but it's bound to cause confusion
for quite some time.
