The problem with that habit, is that if you're very deadpan
sometimes, it works very well in your little peer group who know
perfectly well that you dont mean it when you tell them how much you
loathe them.

Then you get a pickup group, or new guild, and tell somebody to
"die, please." with no emoticon and... suddenly, for some inexplicable
reason, you're unpopular ;)
