Exactly my point.  Say you're on the Good team, and you have nothing against
Neutrals, and only want to kill Evils.  An example is if you are a follower
of Rodcet Nife, and want to roleplay the NPC alliance that the the Temple of
Life in Qeynos has with the followers of Karana.  You cannot tell the Evils
apart from the Neutrals (nor can a Neutral tell the difference between an
Evil and a Good).  Asking before attacking is simply impractical in PvP.

The only way such a cease fire might work on this server is to wait for
guilds to form, and keep track of which guild is on which team.  Then you
could possibly have cease-fires between certain guilds.
