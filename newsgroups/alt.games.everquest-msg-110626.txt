I suppose I shouldn't be complaining. Afterall I mostly have Berserker's armor
or better. But back during pre-velious.. even pre-kunark, it was a real hassle
being cursed with an inability to win items in Plane of Hate, having gone there
roughly 19 times on my main warrior, and about 12 times on my warrior on Rallos
Zek, and 5 times on my bard, between 1999 and 2002, it's been sheer hell ever
trying to win a piece of indicolite. Literally every time i've ever visitted
this zone somehow I've been screwed over, one time a warrior breastplate rotted
on R'tal while I was dead and they forgot to ressurect me. . . One time a
warrior ninja looted r'tal and stole his three drops before I could roll, many
many times I've rolled a 99 just to have someone roll a 100, I go there as the
only warrior or bard on the whole raid, thinking for sure i'd win a piece of
armor... And then the raid is called off before we pull anything drops... So in
2001 I gave up on PoH, never to return again. Since then i've upgraded my
equipment in Kael / PoG gear, though I'm still wearing barbed ringmail, I go to
PoH one last time, and .... right away, a warrior breastplate drops, a fellow
guildy outbids me by 15 points (2335, I bid 2325)

Whining Warrior, Innoruuk
