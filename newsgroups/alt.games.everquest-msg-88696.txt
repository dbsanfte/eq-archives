I'm not big on camping - but when I do, I usually plant my pet
right on the spawn spot, and have a hotkey along the lines of

/pet kill A Bloodgill Goblin
/pause 3
/pet target
/pause 3
/assist

With my 49 firepet I was holding the top level - getting to each
spire before it spawned, park pet on spawn point, gobby pops, 
hit hotkey (sometimes the gobby beat me to the punch).  It'd 
take awfully fast reflexes to beat that, even with a melee class
right on the spawn.  I've always felt that if I'm not ready
when it pops - I'm not controlling the camp.  Having the pet parked
on it forces me to be ready - or admit I'm in over my head and
go somewhere else/ get a partner.
