But I play for the personal satisfaction. If I don't 'feel' individually 
involved then I'm not satisfied with the play experience... and I'd 
rather be playing MOO then :)

To a point yeah.

True but I originally said that 65th was really not *that* much 
different than 1st (its the same game) so racing to 65th was pretty 
dippy. SOmeone mentioned raiding, which is true... but that "can" start 
at 46th... so if you just want to get to the raid game 65th is still 20 
levels farther than you had to grind. :)
