I have presented the refutations of those arguments. Still waiting to
hear the rebuttal.

Will go too far in the future, or will go too far with this patch?

The idea they will go too far in this patch is ludicrous; the changes
they are making are too minor to have any real impact on the ease of
the game (this point is constantly being ignored, its never been
refuted).

The idea they will go too far in the future is the slippery slope
argument; I have yet to see how this patch MUST lead to more
cheapening patches down the road. Until someone DOES make the
connection, this conclusion has to be considered a fallacy. People are
welcome to fear the possibility; I imagine they also fear the
possibility of being struck by an asteroid from space. It's possible,
but there's no reason to believe it will happen....

Non sequitur.

Let's look at that statement, shall we? Because Verant reduced the
death penalty about two years and eight months ago, cutting it in
half. That, according to your logic, made the game easier and brought
in more griefers. But are there more griefers in reality because of
that? If you think yes, I can't WAIT to hear your proof....
