Well, necros can be pullers too, and before they nerfed the Luclin mask, I 
would argue that a 60 necro could pull better than a 60 monk, but that's 
not the reason for the beads.  Necros can lifetap the eye, and even though 
the eye only has 50hp or something, they can get the full amount of hp 
that their tap does.  
After a battle, rez, whatever, a necro will refresh whatever level of lich 
they're using to turn HP into mana, then will cast an eye, tap it for the 
hp.  Repeat until FM and full health.
