Oh I dunno.  I still use my book when I don't feel like waiting for 
pages to load, or when I don't feel like making EQ lag, or when I don't 
want to lose sight of the game for some reason (ie, camping something 
and don't want to miss a pop).

Hah.  People are lazy.  I'm sure you'll still hear *plenty* of "what's 
the loc of such and such?" and "sum1 come gide me frm here to there 
plz?"
