Try a Ranger.  They will work as well as a Warrior for getting game
mechanics down, will get some spells at level 9, so you can see what magic
is like, get the wonderful tracking skill, and can solo well all the way up
to very high levels, so you won't be forced to group.  Warriors are pretty
group dependent unless twinked.

As far as race goes, I'd say consider Halfling.  They get hide and sneak as
racial abilities so will start off at skill level 50.  Rangers get them as
class skills, but not until 10 for sneak and 25 for hide.  Oh, and Halflings
also get an XP bonus, so level faster.  They also have one of the least
confusing starting cities of any race, and there are some simple quests in
Rivervale that give nice XP at low levels that you can run repeatedly--gives
you something to do if for some reason things are too crowded out in Misty
Thicket (or, since once of them involves a trip between Rivervale and Misty
and back, you can do it once each time you come to town to sell).

Stay away from races that don't have infravision and hide.
