Just to add another element to the mix:

If you're at the point in the game where you can only get about 200
plat to twink your next character, you would have to be fairly far up
the curve of knowledge of this sort of game to play a monk well.
Warriors, up to level 50, are pretty straightforward and will give you
a chance to get familiar with the game and how things balance out as
you reach the endgame without focusing on a lot of other details. It's
really hard to get a warrior to level 50 and not have your necessary
skills trained up.

I played a warrior to 36, a cleric to 24 and a necromancer to 54
before I felt comfortable enough with the game to play a rogue, which
is roughly as complicated as the monk.
