Yes, a lot of guilds I know will make you pay to attend raids. They add 
it to the guild treasury (more like the guildmaster's if you ask me) and 
say it's for guild expenses (whatever THAT may be). Personally I've 
never seen the logic of a guild that requests that you pay to attend 
raids. Also, they may be having a lottery at the end of the event and 
some use it like a "door prize".
