I have two.

I remember the first time I was successful at kiting with my Bard. I was 
in the Lake of Ill Manners near the mill. I had just finished a close 
fight with a Golblin, and was healing up. All of a sudden I draw some 
sitting agro from a Sarnak. I jump up, hit Selos, and take off with him 
in tow.

Some ways away from the mill, I turn around to face my opponent up near 
one of the corners only to find a friend has joined in the fray. My 
first instinct was to run for it and zone. Then I decided to try to kite 
them both. I switched to one of the external views and started running 
circles around them, trying to stay as close as possible so the Denon's 
would hit. I ended up losing down to half before I got the timing right, 
but I then started making some headway on my foes. 20 minutes later, I 
had killed the two Sanaks along with a couple skellies, two goblins, and 
2 other Sarnaks that ended up with the pack. I was on the edge of my 
seat the entire time.

Another time I was playing my druid in Paludal. I was invited into a 
group with 2 SKs, an enchanter, and a Wizard to fill a cleric that had 
to log. It was fun for the simple reason that my ego was being stroked.

I buffed everyone with what I had. The enchanter gave us all Breeze. We 
set up at camp 2, and the SKs started pulling. The Chanter had no CC 
skills, but it hardly mattered. Upon a pull, I would DS the SKs, and 
snare the MOBs. The SKs would keep themselves healed for the most part, 
but I would throw a heal their way every know and then. If the pull was 
too big, I would root the extras and put a DoT on them, so that when 
root broke or the MA would engage them, they were already soft. The 
Wizard was nuking as needed, as was the enchanter, to the best of her 
ability.

All through the night I kept getting tells from the two SKs telling me 
that I was doing a real good job, and that they had wished I had been 
there before, instead of the previous Cleric. I took that as a real 
compliment.

We ended up leveling a couple of times, and nobody died. Was a real fun 
time.
