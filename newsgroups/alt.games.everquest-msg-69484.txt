Well, I got this

[Sat Dec 15 12:17:59 2001] <SYSTEMWIDE MESSAGE>: LeadGM-Maevianiu :
Greetings! Ssra Temple will be comming down across all servers for a quick
update in 20 minutes. Please leave that zone or log out. Thank you.

and then

[Sat Dec 15 13:04:14 2001] You disband your party.  <<--- because I went LD

I was not in SSra Temple.      Never saw a general server down message, and
not in my logs.

Wonder if they made the patch to the Temple, then brought that back up, and
slapped the network?

However, the web site is dead as well.


no matter, sun outside the window.   I might go look at it, and the nice
green grass.
