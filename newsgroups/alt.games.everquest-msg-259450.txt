Just to double check, it is crashing to desktop, not resetting the 
computer?

When I recently upgraded my system to an ASUS MB with an Athlon XP, I 
found that there was an issue with the DDR memory compatibility with that 
particular MB.  I ended up getting Kingston Technology to swap the memory 
for the same model memory sticks with a different brand of memory chips 
on them, and that fixed the issue for me.  In my case however, it was 
resetting the computer, not just crashing to desktop.  I could also 
duplicate the problem by running a different memory intensive program.

If it is resetting the computer, you can tweak the speed the memory is 
running at down from what the BIOS recommends, and that fixed the problem 
for me, until Kingston replaced the memory.

If it is just crashing to desktop, then, the next question would be, did 
you install the video and sound drivers after installing directX 9?  If 
not, try reinstalling them.
