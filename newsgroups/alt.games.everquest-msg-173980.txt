Snicker, I do not advocate choice 2 and I realize that there are many
choices between the 2 . What I am doing is pointing out a truth many
foreigners and native sons may not understand. You would be horrified to
know exactly how many people WILL engage in genocide to stop terrorism.
Anything less than this is showing restraint and perhaps doing so against
the wishes of the people in a country where the people control the
goverment. We are by no means at the point yet where the clamoring for a
holy war is high and widespread but we could very easily get there.
