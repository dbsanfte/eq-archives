Yup, I was doing it wrong.  One of those things where you read something,
but you *know* what it says, so you read it wrong everytime.

Much like trying to find a bug in your own code.  You can spend an hour and
not get it just to have a friend take 3.8 seconds and say "Why you you doing
THAT?" and point out your obvious error.

Thanks for pointing out my mistake.    Of course, I gated back to FP in
frustration to brew some more... *sigh*
