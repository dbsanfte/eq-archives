My current camp spot isn't an option for you yet.

For now, you might consider Dulak's harbor.  The first boat
(from the right) has mobs you can easily solo and get XP.

Lady Di has mobs that are high DB to you and are probably more
of a challenge.  However, there is a spot you can invis to then
set up your pet unmolested and pull to without adds.

Now, I've never done these mobs at that level, so be very careful,
you might be too low for it.

These guys drop gems, 3-5pp on average and research components.
(Hint - with 101 research and a LoY advanced research tome you
can turn a wide variety of research components into swatches that
go for 9pp to a vendor)
