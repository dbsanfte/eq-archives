At 26, in my trusty uber ornate electrum chain, I soloed red avocets in
SK. Pull with Malise. Reapply Malise till it sticks, then DoT (and reDoT)
it til it turns to run away, then finish with melee. Stay out of reach
with SoW. Run around in circles so you don't get too far away. Works great
until you run out of mana from resists, or SoW falls off, or you get an
add, or you go link dead. Took about 10 minutes from pull to FM/FH after
the kill.

The shamanic version of bardic bellow kiting. Also, like bellow kiting,
very boring :/

No, it's not soloing reds at 59, but it ain't 10 neither...
