Hi, I am now a 26 Druid and as you can wonder, I had the same 
thoughts as you: which spells really worth it knowing that I am far 
from being a rich man :(
Here the list of 24 spells (not the Rings) and my comments:

- Pogonip: rain AoE DD : wait before buying this spell, unless you 
already try multi-mobs kitting (more than one mob)
- Resist Fire : upgrade of Endure Fire : take it only if you have 
to fight fire-based caster mobs

- Ensnaring Roots : upgrade of Grasping Roots : a must have for 
kitting, even if this spell is -IMHO- quite as resisted as Grasping 
Roots :(

- Creeping Crud : bugs-based DOT : the upgrade of Stinging Swarm, a 
real mana eater but also very useful when soloing (in good groups 
you will often have a support-like role: complementary healer, 
buffer, only a few nukes. Soloing, kitting to me more precise, you 
MUST use this spell while snaring and rooting, and medding facing 
your DOTted mob

- Dismiss Summoned : summoned creatures specific DD: only if you 
fight summoned creatures :P because it is largely more mana-
efficient for this kind of mobs than your classic DD spells

- Sunbeam : AoE blind spell : really a worthless spell in my 
opinion... never used it for now, you do not have enough spell gem 
slots to use a so little useful spell

- Spirit Of Cheetah : great speed enhancer spell for several dozens 
of seconds (a few less than one minute), useable every quarter of 
hour; more useful than the blind spell above, because you will also 
use this one in emergency situations, to run away.
CAREFUL: it needs that you wipe off your SOW or Wolf Form before, 
if you don't do it the spell won't be casted and u will have to 
wait for a more quarter of hour again.

- Charm Animal : upgrade of Befriend Animal : most druids do not 
charm (do not /bonk me if I am wrong: that is what say almost all 
my druid fellows) because you have to re-charm the mob often unless 
you let the charm fade away and then you must fight him, but it 
worths the learning of this technique: you will be able to do more 
XP than if you had passed one hour shouting you were looking for a 
group. Try first with the first spell, Befriend Animal, if you 
never charmed and wonder how it works. You will see at usage

- Tremor : large AoE blankpoint-targetted earth DD : use lots of 
mana points and it is not as powerful as the name let you dream 
about. Do not take it now, wait to have more extra plats

- Skin Like Steel: AC/HP buff, upgrade of Skin Like Rock: a MUST 
HAVE of course, I write it if you ever thought you had enough AC or 
HP you wrong! ;)

- Wolf Form : ATK/Speed/Faction buff and Wolf Elemental illusion: a 
must have too, cast it in place of SOW: it lasts longer and gives 
you a better speed of movement, plus an ATK buff if you still do 
some pure melee (you should stop soon). Let you sell and buy to 
some merchants naturally considerating negative to you in some 
places, according to local factions.
TAAAAAKE IT NOW

Here is my answer, I hope I have made it clear enough.
Choose well now!
