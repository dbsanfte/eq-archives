Im sure if he has levelled to 40 he has at least one friend/usual groupie
that he could cajole into coming with him, especially if they are in the
same DL dilemma. You all need to be a bit more creative when finding
somewhere to group, it is possible to create your own groups, you dont have
to sit doing LFG until someone bestows a group upon you.
Why not try going through a zone or two recruiting for whatever dungeon you
want?
Stand in Iceclad or EW and shout for people to go and storm ToFS or Crystal
Caverns. Chances are you will find at least a soloing druid who is getting
bored and wants someone to chat with. Or you might find another 5 lost souls
like yourself and really get a good group together.
Another piece of advice, that was given to me on this board, is to ask your
DL group if they would like to try hunting somewhere else. This has worked
for me a few times and I had a much more fun time than in the grind of DL.
Everyone in the group thanked me afterwards for suggesting it and said they
had a great time. Just make sure you have a porter in the group, people lose
interest very quickly if they have to run too far.
The other thing about playing in DL is that there is never really a danger
of group wipeout or even one death. Some say that this is the ideal
situation, low risk, high gain. Unfortunately this safe xp makes you lazy
with your character, and you stop doing the things that your class can do
well and just  stand there pressing the attack or heal or nuke button every
so often. Life or death situations are what show how good/bad a player you
are, will make you a better player, and also give you the biggest rush of
the game.
Can you remember the last time you won a battle with less than 100 hp spare?
with all your healers LOM and medding just to get one heal off? and your
druid sitting with his hand over the evac button?

Thats the game!
