Precisely my point! (ergo, don't ask - don't tell)

Thats so fucked up, it ain't even funny.  Funny thing is, you got it
right in the first situation, but beings how the second remotely
involves "gay" you roll all over yourself.  So tell me, how the fuck
does someone "look" gay ?

Hate laws ?? Shit man, thats even WORSE than the P.C. thing !!!

So you are telling us that you want to legistate human attraction now???
Ohhhhhh boy!!!! we got some shit here !  So I can see it now: throw
the hard working, upstanding citizen in jail because he "hates" his
ex girlfriend/wife.  What kind of shit is that ?????????  If THAT is 
case, might as well take all of San Fran (and all of Calif for that matter)
and make the WHOLE dam state a jail, cause you're gonna need it, because
with all the Senators on Capitol hill hatin each other, the'll ALL
hand up in jail.  And every red neck in a bar fight too!

Human attraction/repulsion is a NATURAL thing - so screwing with
mother nature like that, better be dancing like a horney toad frog
on a hot stove to dodge them lighting bolts!
