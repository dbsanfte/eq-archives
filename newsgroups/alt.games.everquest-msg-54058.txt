On a related note, for a 26th lvl ranger how easy is it to get in kill a
deathly usher and get out. From all reports this is a group place only
(bit like Unrest but worse). The map seems to indicate fairly simple
routes in and out but last time I went near the place (lvl 22) the blue
mobs near the zone were just waiting for me to twitch.
