	(Who does normal ones anyway?)

	Oh, foo.  Even if the group's so uber I don't have to heal
a cleric makes a respectable tank for typical blues.  Load some stuns,
cast elixir on the pull, and I can keep the adds as busy as a druid
could...

	The only time a cleric might be a "burden" is if you
so overpower your content that the shaman doesn't have to slow
and can heal all the time.  In which case he's basically a cleric
with a pet.

	Yes, I know, 6 necros, or a kite group...  But it's hard to see
how any normal group doesn't benefit from a dedicated healer.  Doing 
stuff like chain pulling nests a druid will go OOM and a shaman will
be doing nothing but canni and heal...
