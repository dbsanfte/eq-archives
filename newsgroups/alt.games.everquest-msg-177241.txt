Point:  Stun the mob.  a: gives tank time to taunt above your increased
agro.  b: gives healer time to get that heal off on you.  c: gives you
time to root it (assuming your root is longer than your stun). Almost
always works with my enchanter.  There are also times when running
around in tight circles is a good thing.  Running around randomly in
panic is never good.

Point 2: at the high levels root isn't going to stick for more than a
second, it will just piss the mob off at you more.  know when to use it,
know when to not.

STFU and let the casters do what they know how to do.
