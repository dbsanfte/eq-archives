I've just started playing my first Iksar.  He's a monk, and reached level 4
a couple nights ago.  I've got a level 5 dwarven cleric and a level 3
half-elf bard, so I'm not *completely* new to the game.

This question isn't of immediate concern, but I figure it'll be useful
sometime in the future.  What if, one day, I decide that my monk has had
enough of Kunark, and wants to explore the rest of the world?  Let's say he
wants to go to Antonica, and hang around near Freeport eventually.  What
would I be able to do to raise his faction enough that he'd actually be able
to enter the city and buy/sell stuff?

Thanks in advance.

Paul
