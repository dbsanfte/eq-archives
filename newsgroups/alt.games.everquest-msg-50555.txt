Hi, as I'm sure you all know, there is a multitude of items that increase
INT, WIS, and STA as well as others but these are the one's I've got a
question about.  Say my 13 mage gets a ring that gives 5 to INT, does that
INT affect her mana?  Does it affect the mana from previous levels where I
didn't have the extra INT.  Or does it only affect the Mana I get from the
INT stat for each level I have it on?    I hope I didn't lose anyone in
that, but the same would go for WIS for wis casters and STA for
HP...interesting question

Please reply directly to my e-mail address, since I rarely remember to check
the NGs :)
