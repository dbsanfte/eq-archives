I make arrows for the fun of it as a Chanter to get my Fletching up, but I 
sell them all back to the merchant.  My warrior just makes the longest 
range arrows he can for maximum pullage.  I don't give a squat about good 
damage on pulling with my bow.

What I -do- suggest is buy the componants to make a good bow, like
a Hemp Darkwood.  Find someone who has a wonderful fletching skill to make 
it.  If you aren't kiting, you don't care about delay, so that
will give you 150 range ( I think ) and 25 damage ( I think ).  If you have
someone that has a good CHA that will buy for you, assuming the combine 
works on the first attempt, I think it will cost you about 250pp.
