Generally 1 point for pussy raid, 2 points for success on general end mob
encounter, 3 points for special hard bastards. No points for turning up on
time, else you could turn up, wait 20 mins and then bugger off. Raids that
require extensive clearing (NToV) gain extra points for time spent clearing.

My guild .
Planes Fear,Air,Hate, Kunark Dragons, Velketor, Servitor etc. 1 elp, maybe
extra for clearing all demis in planes
Doomshade, Rumblecrush, NToV dragons etc. 2elps
Avatar of War level of mobs 3 elps

When we started and weren't so strong then old planes, velk etc. would earn
2elps

Minimum spend on an item is 1 elp, no max. Some items can be class
restricted and have a minimum elps bid imposed at discretion of officers.
All bids are left to the guild to bid sensibly ie. Sword drops
War,Pal,Shd,Rng,Brd effect Enraging Blow, would be sensible for warrior to
win so other classes would sensibly not outbid MAs, another example would be
a FTV range slot all/all obviously better for casters so Paladins would be
expected to not bid. You can bid on an item if it is an upgrade to the item
you currently have. If the item you upgrade is droppable then it is handed
back to guildbank for ELP bid in forums and if no one wants is sold for
guild funds (peris,pearls etc.) Selling items for personal profit that have
been won on a raid via ELPSs is /guildremove offence. Handing back an item
you spent ELPs on awards you a refund of 50% of the elps you spent.

Spells are awarded to those that can mem the spell and given out in order of
who has raided the most. Spells not memmed at raid are passed to guild bank
for use of those when the meet required lvl.

No I don't want a sammich
