Warriors are one trick ponies.  It just happens to be a very good trick.

The only thing they have over monks is /discipline defensive.    This
wouldn't be a big deal, except Verant designed the "endgame" assuming that
every raid has a person capable of defensive, and is using it.  So every
ubermob puts out "Desired damage for it's difficulty level" + 30%.

The only reason to make a warrior over a monk is that at the very end of the
game, they make one certain type of fight a lot easier.  A monk enjoys the
advantage in the other 99% of the game...
