Hi, being that I am a Level 23 Druid, I understand how hard it is to make
money.  I just finished the ToV quest last night after staying up until 4am
he finally popped.  But when i got the book in my hand, it made the hours
feel worthwhile.  It is a simple quest, my advice is to do the Jester card
first then go and kill starshine. While there make sure that the bad guy has
walked away then root and nuke the hell out of starshine.. the Viola!!  you
have the book.  The book will be a great thing for you to have at your
level.. and hopefully you can catch starshine while he is there and wont
have to wait like i did.

About the money situation,  I was selling HQ pelts until I started on
tailoring.. now i use them=)  But you can make some decent Plat off them..
On Bristlebane a stack goes for around 150-200PP and if you are still
getting exp for the cats it is a great way to go.  You can go to stonebrunt
if you have a great high level char to help you through the warrens and to
help with the cats.. they usually only drop MQ and HQ pelts.

Befallen was a great way to make plat this weekend.. the DE's were dropping
bronze weapons.. and an occasional scythe.. i made approx. 300PP over the
weekend from going and killing green's to me.

But at your level there are not too many places you can go just yet to make
fat coin.  so just wait around.. when you hit the 20's you can go to High
Keep.. they drop some decent loot.. go to OOT and kill gargoyles each eye
sells for around 8PP..

so good luck to you.  and keep your head up in no time you will be level 29
and porting people for some great money... just wait till you get that one
tell ..."will you port me for a corpse run i will pay you 200PP"  nice
feeling=)

I know some of the info has been used in other posts.. just passing along
all my great advice that i have learned from here and websites
