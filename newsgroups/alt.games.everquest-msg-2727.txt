Indeed.  Hang out in EW for any length of time, and you'll
be guaranteed to hear "/auction WTB HQ Tundra Kodiak Pelts,
paying very well" several times.

They're such a pain to get, and such a rare drop, that people
are willing to pay serious money to avoid the pain and boredom
of killing 568,219 Tundra Kodiaks in order to turn up two
HQ pelts.

I myself have been whomping Tundra Kodiaks whenever I come
across them, and in several weeks of adventuring (not all in
EW) I've got a grand total of one HQ pelt.
