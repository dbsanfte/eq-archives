You have to come back online within 30 minutes or something I believe, but, 
otherwise, yes, you can get points after the fact.  There is a level 65 
warrior on EMarr, named Jandaan who routinely took advantage of that by 
going afk for extended periods, or "LD"ing, only to conveniently get back 
online in time to get the points.
