I agree with your tactics.
However, this should be decided in advance.  I played in a group one night
where the paladin, monk, and bard all wanted to pull.  They waited until we got
in the dungeon to start arguing about it tho.  It got quite ugly, and the
chanter, wizard and cleric, (me), were terribly uncomfortable and really didn't
want to get caught up in their argument.  I'm sure they are all very fine
pullers.
It *was* the paladin's group though, and he had said from the moment we started
gathering in BB that HE would be the puller.  Had I been the bard or the monk
I'd have just opted out of the group, instead of waiting until we got started
and then decide to bicker about who's the king of the mountain.  If they'd have
all started pulling at the same time just to prove a point.... well.... I'm
sure I'd have left the group once the corpse run was over.... :)
