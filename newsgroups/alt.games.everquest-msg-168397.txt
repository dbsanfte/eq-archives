Subject: 36 Pally fightning in RM?

Was thinking of taking my 36 Pally to RM to fight the giant skeletons who I've
heard are about my level.  Having difficulty finding places to solo undead, and
fighting undead is really the only way my pally can survive, and I thought
these skels might be good exp for him.  Don't really care about the loot very
much since I use another char to equip this guy.  Anyone think these skelly's
would be good for him?  Thanks in advance.
