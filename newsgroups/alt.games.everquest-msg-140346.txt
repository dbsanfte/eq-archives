And a few other odball ones, like Garzicor's Memory (or whatever it's
called.) You not only need Ally for that one, you need MAX Ally.

Also, JJ, if you plan on killing any CoV dragons later on, getting maxed
out faction will give you somewhat of a buffer zone so you don't
immediately drop to KOS on the first kill. You can alway patch it up
again later in Kael if needed.
