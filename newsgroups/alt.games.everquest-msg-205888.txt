    I mostly notice this when I'm in the spellbook, as it happens most often
when I try and mem spells. I have yet to spontaneously stand when I'm
sitting, although I'm sure it'll start happening now that I've said that.

    Already done. Considering that the odds are about 50-50 of memming an
entire spell set and NOT getting interrupted, I imagine they've experienced
it themselves. It seems to have started when the spell set thing was patched
