Now, none of my characters are even near planar yet, but this particular 
aspect of the impending "improvements" raises some concern for me 
regarding the overall direction they are taking with the game.

First, let me say that I am all for fixing what's broken in the game. 
Granted, the idea of what is broken is very subjective. That said, I'm a 
little concerned with the implications of this particular "fix".

Someone correct me if I'm wrong here, but if a guild is committed to 
getting all of their members flagged for these planes, isn't it just a 
matter of members (flagged and otherwise) putting the time into it? It 
appears to me that this is just catering to the guilds where the members 
cannot be bothered to help out guildmates. It removes the reward for 
strong guilds and gives it to guilds with less loyalty and cohesion.

Additionally, what's up with the "reward" for those that have gotten 
their flags? Isn't that kind of like today's tendency to give awards to 
all contestants regardless of their performance? Did they do anything 
special for everyone over level 35 when they took the spellbook away from 
medding? How about everyone who had to use boats before the PoP came out? 
I just don't understand the need for this reward other than consolation 
to prevent whining.

If anyone can clear this up for me, I'd appreciate it.
