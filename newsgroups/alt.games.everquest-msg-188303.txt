Yeah I know what you mean.  Frustrating when a "trivial slowed" mob gets a
lucky resist, and then cuz the shaman dies and the mob is unslowed, the
group gets owned.

From my own experiences with it, as long as the mob isn't immune to speed
changes (aka root/snare.. seems to be just 1 attribute), it will land NP.
I've had 1 resist so far, so its really (really) easy to land

Hmm group cheal..  I dunno what a good price is right now (at work).. I know
my guild bought several copies of it a while back, so I'll see what kinda
price we were paying.

Every shaman, wizard and mage in my guild got this on PoP release, and
seeing 10 billion pets looked so cool. When I finally dinged 65 and got it,
I thought.. "wow this is fun", for all of 5 seconds anyway...

Are you guys allied with anybody?  I think as-is, tier 2 bosses (for tier 3
entry) would be an extremely painful experience for you guys...
