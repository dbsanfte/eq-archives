Hi.. welcome to my world.. 9.7k/1700AC. If your AC is low thats
probably why you have trouble tanking there.

Yup.. and with pet tanking i'll bet you pick pieces of your group
members off the walls that way pretty often. It can work.. but the
number of things that can go wrong is so high it isn't even funny. Pet
tanking in GoD is a great way to get yourself killed. If you go pet
dps, the healing for a 9.6k tank isn't that bad so long as the charm
is in effect. Mobs drop 10-15 seconds which is like a patch each from
cleric and druid. Always make sure you go full out on the pet. Mage
pet items, haste, ndt, etc. I prefer flinty cragbeasts for charm pet.

Definately a good move. Clr/Dru on healing is pretty essential.

>Team 2 is War, Clr, Dru, Nec, Enc, Rng just for information purposes.

I consider 3 key aspects to safe charming in Tipt, especially in
pickup group(not what yours is, but usually what I run into). Charmer
with TD3, Snarer, and a stunner that is not the Cleric. You just left
out stunner. It can work.. but your enchanter will have to make sure
he keeps distance at all times, and that can be difficult with the
tight confines. I prefer wizard on the stunning portion due to 8
second stuns. The 3 working together can get a freshly charmed mob
back to adding dps in no more than 15-20 seconds. Other forms of CC
like rooting or mezzing the break can be problematic on time or
movement, and as you know a tank without pet dps can drain healer mana
pretty fast. Your group 1 with the paladin should work pretty well for
the stunning aspect.

When doing Tipt I usually try to sprint and rest, getting through a
set of mobs up to safe area and then medding up for the next set. And
as you know the boss is just a matter of WS or Furious by the warrior
while the pet beats the tar out of the mob.
