If you don't mind taking advantage of people a bit, you can auction to sell
batwings in EC (the original poster is a Dark Elf, so getting to EC is no
problem).  When you find a buyer, you buy the wings from the batwing
merchant, for about 2 gold 6 silver a stack, and then deliver them.  For
some reason, many people don't realize that batwings are for sale at a
merchant in the zone, and if you can find one of these people, you can make
quite a profit.
