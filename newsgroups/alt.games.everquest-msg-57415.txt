Not an option Dave. I have an NTL 'phone line. AOL were my only option
for unmetered and no disconnect time, prior to this sneaky move.
Luckily NTL have got their act together and I now can get NTL World.
It took a long time as an ex CWC subscriber but at least now I have
another option. There is a two hour cut off with NTL but that's
workable and also has the advantage on being a standard DUN so large
unattended downloads are possible with Get Right etc.

Regards.
