Not really.  From what I remember, if a rune gives 500 hp, and I have 1000
max hp unbuffed, I will now have 1500 max hp after the rune, for however long
the rune is active, even if I go to 1 hp.  From what Bob wrote, it seems the
ward will expire as soon as I get to 999 hp, leaving me with 1000 max hp again.

Maybe it was changed after I quit.
