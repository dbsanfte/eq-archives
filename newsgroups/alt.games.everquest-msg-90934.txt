Not that I know exactly what's happening but doesn't look good.
Logged in after several dozen attempts to see all servers up but can't get
into any worlds, dumped back to login screen, tried chat...dumped even
further back, Chat is full (uh oh not a good sign) I expect to see another
patch soon so I'm off out.
Spent every night this weekend out (rare for me these days) and now I'm
going out again (if only to see mates who are prolly playing DAoC) spending
far to much time in Real World, just not good for me.

Was only going to be shopping in EC anyway :ï¿½)
