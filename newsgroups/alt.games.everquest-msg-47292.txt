See Bob, you are the kind of guy, that if anyone said on the 11th at 6AM
EST, that today, 3 planes would smash into landmarks, killing 7,000 people,
would call it paranois. My goal is to reasonably have some defenses (which
are better than none) when things happen FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES. This
isn't some "crisis", this is forever, everyday, from now on. Maybe you
haven't figured that out yet, but that's ok, people like me are compasionate
to people still catching up.

People read religeous manuals for spiritual sustanance. I reccomend people
reading lighlty survival tips and books. To keep the body as fit as the
spirit. We probaby spend more time reading 1 single game manual. Not that
big a deal. Emergency services will be TAXED if any event happens. You will
be on your own in many scenarios.

BTW, Paranioa is only applicalbe if there is no reasons to expect or
validate such possibilities, therefore you can't paint this that way. You
are the kind of person when something happens will be knocking (if not
scratching at) the neighbor's door begging for food and shelter becuae you
were too stupid to take a few smart prcautions before hand. So save them the
bother and yourself the pathetic expectation and stand on your own two feet.
Even if nothing ever happens.
