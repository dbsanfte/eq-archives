You know, I'm going back and looking at my response again, and I *still*
fail to see where you think I was acting "like a jerk". I made it very
clear I was kidding around with him, but that also his answer was
definitely applicable only to the highest strata of players. Now
somebody else already chimed in and pointed out the specific AC and Stat
bonus differences between the various types of quest armor, and that was
great info. However, all I really saw from Sang's answer was, "that
stuff is such useless crap that everyone already has a bank vault full
of that I can't even *give* it away."  And frankly, that's not much of a
reason for picking one faction over another, at least for us Kael
newbies.

I'm sure that's probably very true (about the armor being common as
dirt) in Sang's guild, but not in mine or those of any of the friends
that I hunt with regularly. Just a different world down at my level.

See above. I don't feel in any different mood than I normally am, and I
was joking around with Sang about being uber, and I really don't see
where I was being "testy" etc.  Granted, I've gone off on a shotgun rant
in some of the Verant, SoL, Lawsuit threads, but that's just becaue I
tired of dealing with idiots here and don't always suffer fools gladly,
as the saying goes. But no... I haven't suddenly transformed into an
abusive asshole or anything.

So go fuck yourself.
