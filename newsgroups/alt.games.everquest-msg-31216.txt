Could be, though I don't go around in the game rallying some cause "free the
names" or anything. I was there in the flesh so to speak when this guy that
got petitioned was whining, but I never bothered to join in the fray in any
way whatsoever, I've also never discussed it in usenet or any other forum
before now. I do not see how going in on one little conversation and taking
this side once somehow makes me care too much about the subject. (or caring
too much is the gist I got of your messg anyway). We've all got opinions
about things, just because I am viewing mine doesn't indicate how much I do
or don't care about it.
