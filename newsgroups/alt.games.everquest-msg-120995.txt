    Think of it from a roleplaying point of view. "Honey, you run over and
die to that hideous monster, then when you pop back into reality again run
over and attack it again, until it dies!" Hence the cheesy thing - it's
sorta like the rules lawyers you used to encounter in AD&D turning what
would be a heroic fight ("I unsheath my sword and have at the vile beast!")
into an exercise in min/maxing ("You allow STR bonus on thrown items, so I
start peppering the enemy with darts which can be thrown faster than any
other item and deal maximal damage. And I specialized in darts, so....")

    On old dragon raids, people used to be sent into the dragon's lair in
waves. First the melees would go in and gain aggro, then the casters would
come in later (having avoided the early dragon's breath attacks) and start
chain-nuking for all they were worth. The raid leader would /shout which
wave should charge when, I guess because it sounded cool.

    Well, one guild on our server was being annoying back when Kunark was
the newest expansion. They would kill the big dragon in the expansion
(Trakanon) and not let anyone else get a chance at him, and would even
petition the GMs if someone else tried to race them to it. So one day, when
they were buffing and getting ready to attack, some rival guild's enchanter
who was at zone-in shouted "Wave One, GO GO GO!" That is when the annoying
guild learned that they should include intelligence tests in their
recruiting process, as half the melees ran in and ended up getting everyone
wiped out. Whenever I think of raiders mindlessly swarming something, I
think of that incident.  (That annoying guild didn't learn, BTW, as a later
incident with someone shouting "CLERICS CAMP!" during an until-then
successful fight confirmed.)
