Any time someone has used an AOE in a LDoN it's always set off a cursed 
box.  Speaking of boxes, ignore them, DO NOT TOUCH THEM unless the 
adventure is complete and the rest of the group agrees that it is safe to 
check it or you are the only one within 5 rooms of it.  Even clicking on 
them will set them off sometimes.
