I'm perhaps a little off the topic of this thread but I'd like to say a few
things about my views on these points.

No.  You mean the mere creation of a "Department of Homeland Security" is
not a problem -- as a matter of fact, I would heartily agree with such a
department.  The problem is the create of a "Big Brother Department" which
is named the "Department of Homeland Security" in a rather transparent
effort to conceal the fact that it is being given far too much power to
interfere with personal liberties.

The war on drugs is a joke.  They're not stopping shit, all they're doing is
punishing random people for doing something to themselves, not to anyone
else.  The government should not have the right to protect you from
yourself.  I would understand if they were to limit the use of drugs like
PCP that can make people hurt others, but things like heroin and coke,
although it's stupid to use them, should still be legal because nobody is
hurt except for the user.  And... weed?  Please!  Marijuana is probably the
most harmless drug in existence.  There has never been a single documented
death from marijuana overdose... you'd probably have to smoke several pounds
of the stuff, and I don't know if you'd even be able to smoke that much fast
enough to have lethal levels of THC in your system.  If they're going to
consider that a danger they might as well outlaw alcohol, tobacco, and
tylenol.

> Not how they also have some hefty resistance from the right.

True but the fact that the government has the power to restrict the Internet
is unsettling.  I'm not entirely comfortable with the way this government
has been going -- of course, the great thing about living in a free country
is I can say -- and do -- something about it if it gets too bad.

All right... while I agree that the government should not regulate your
personal life and while I do think that in some cases the government
interferes in people's family life too much... with all due respect your
family does *not*, I repeat *not*, belong to *you*.  Your family members
belong to *themselves*.  While it's ok and necessary to punish your kids
when they're wrong and to raise them to have certain values, if you hurt
them you're not hurting an object in your posession, you're hurting a human
being.  I know I speak from a valid standpoint because my own family life
very nearly killed me.  I'm not trying to condemn Remington for what he does
with his family, I don't know anything about him... but it is *not* "your
goddamn family".  It is your responsibility to raise your kids to be healthy
because you brought them into the world.  But they are not there for you,
you are there for them.  Period.

As far as the government handing out condoms in public schools... if the
only way you can raise your kids properly is to withhold knowledge from them
then you're doing something wrong.  If you don't think it's wise for your
kids to have sex at their age then tell them that and explain why you feel
that way.  But trust me when I tell you that if they want to have sex, they
will... they're not going to be handed a condom and think, "Oh, well I
wasn't planning on having sex but now I have to so I won't waste this!"  All
that's going to happen is they're going to have sex without the condom if
they can't get one or are too lazy to take the time... and believe me, you
*don't* want that.

I disagree but I don't have time to argue the point right now... I'll post
later with my thoughts on that particular point.
