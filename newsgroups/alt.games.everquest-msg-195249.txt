    Yup, because farming silks is hard!

    Who the hell needs half of this crap? If you have a Fungi, you are all
but invulnerable for your early career - and with damage shield potions, you
don't even need the PLer to follow you around. If you don't have this, an
FBSS (CoF isn't worth the cash to someone looking to be good on a budget),
some smart armour selections, and some of the cheaper 0.5 ratio weapons in
the game have you killing like a champ. Oh, and get some ten slot packs for
the bandages. ;-)

    I don't agree with KEI being castable on low levels either. But to say
it must be nerfed because it creates an imbalance between casters and melees
that must be corrected is as assinine as it gets. Jealousy nerfs are
pointless, because every class should be able to do something better than
all other classes. So unless you're prepared for an endless round of "I
should get X, because I don't have Y and class Z has Y", quit it. If it
should be nerfed, it should be nerfed because the benefits of KEI far
outstrip what the designers intended any item or buff to give someone below
the level at which KEI will land.

    As well they should. How the hell do you find comparables prior to
endgame? Does it mean anything to compare the DPS of a well-equipped
character to a not-so-well equipped character? How do you determine what
"well-equipped" means for an intermediate level character, and make sure
every class in your comparison is at that same level of "well-equipped"?
Comparing end-game characters is easy: put everyone in the best possible
gear, start the comparison. As players complete the different expansions,
they will pass those "comparable" points and be in balance. Gets muddled up
when you start throwing in different expansions with trickle-down power
boosts, but given that most of those trickle-down effects have been to the
advantage of melees, it hasn't been such a problem.
