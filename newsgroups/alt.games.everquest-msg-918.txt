I forget her name ( the rich girl playing at thief and mage in BG2) cast
polymorph self . It let her change from several different forms at will. One
was her natural human form.

I had her fighting as a spider but when I went to change her back, there was
no option. She could no longer change back!! I thought maybe it would wear
off after a while but she was arrested, I did the quest to get her free, and
she is still a spider. Her fiancï¿½ never seemed to notice though.

Since she can no longer cast spells as a spider, she is useless to me.

Any ideas??
