    Hrm who knows what I meant? ;)

    Unbuffed fire and cold resist of 100 i think wouldn't be THAT hard to

gets hehe

    Are you talking vindi and statue? Are they actually easier than dragons?
;)

    I've camped nobles in Veksar with a group of three... Are there higher
camps there that are worth raiding?
