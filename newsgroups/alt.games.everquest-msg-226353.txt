If they didn't promise it with X2, then it not being bundled in with
X2 wouldn't be a problem. Okay, say they bundled the Making of X2 in
with a power rangers tape. (Actually, this would be more like putting
it in with an XMen Evolution DVD. LOE and EQ2 are just as related) But
then they said that anyone could enter to win a free Making of X2
disc. Where's the problem?

Ah, so you're just bitter because they're not handing it to you
guaranteed for free on a silver platter. Gotcha. Sour grapes.

Yeah, they are available separately. You have to apply for them, and
they are limited supply.

And Lords of *EVERQUEST*, a game that's set ON NORRATH, using
EVERQUEST races, but just happens to be a different genre, isn't
related to EVERQUEST 2? How the fuck does that logic work?

See above. The EQ2 beta is NOT only available by buying the product.
