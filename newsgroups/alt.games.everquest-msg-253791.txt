Lucky you.

This was particularly true for peripherals: earlier digital cameras, 
scanners, video capture stuff (and mpeg encodes), some modems, and some 
multifunction printers. I bumped my head into examples of all of these 
during the 'windows 2000' era.

In a lot of cases, the w2k driver has eventually become available, but 
the impetus was the arrival of XP which forced the issue. After all if 
you are rewriting drivers for XP adding 2k compatibility isn't much of a 
giant stretch.

If 2k hardware support is good -now- you can thank Microsoft for forcing 
XP Home/Pro onto the world. Without it, 2K hardware support would still 
be exactly like it was before XP...which was terrible.

Same with games, 2k support for games was quite weak when 2k was their 
'latest OS', things again improved greatly when XP arrived on the home 
users PC and forced the issue with developers.

That much at least is true. XP requires a chunk more RAM, and 'needs
  a faster processor to get the same level of performance. But then its 
2 years later... what did we expect?

Yeah XP Home is a little gimped... but then the the price difference Pro 
is ludicrous too.
