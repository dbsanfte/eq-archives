I'm a relatively new player, looking for clarification on how the skill
advancement rate is determined.  I just made a Barbarian Rogue the other
day.  I've heard that characteristics below 75 incur a penalty.  Given that
I'll be acquiring physical-stat equipment and there are a lot of
physical-stat buffs, I thought it would be appropriate to start my INT at
75, so that I could advance skills at a reasonable rate.

I've just read several reports that either INT or WIS is used to determine
skill advancement, depending upon which is the higher.  This doesn't agree
with my limited personal experience (I've run WIS-based casters with poor
INT up to around level 20 and they seem to advance in skills more slowly
than my characters with decent INT).

Can anyone confirm that WIS is used for skills if it is higher than INT.  If
so, rather than putting 15 points into INT, I could put 5 character points
into WIS and put the other 10 to better use in STR.

Thanks
