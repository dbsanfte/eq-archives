    That's because the five million druids you're not seeing, solo. Many of
them seem to treat EQ as a video game...

    I have to admit I've met some nice druids and some druids who knew their
crap.

    I think most people's irritation towards droods comes from their playing
style, which is dictated by their spells.

    Root pisses fear kiters off. Taking 10 minutes to kill a mob pisses
everyone off because it sits on a perfectly good spawn for that entire time,
multiply this by the number of mobs the drood is sitting on. Worse, a line
of rooted, pissed off mobs becomes a barrier and many droods are careless as
to where they erect these barriers. Few things are more annoying than
fearing a mob, only to turn to follow it and realise that yet again a druid
is just rooting a mob directly in the path.

    And track is an utter bastard to compete with, it's very difficult to
feel well disposed to the guy who's got 3 mobs rooted and rotting and
persists in beating you to your own by a fraction of a second.

    Haven't actually played either but I hear beastlords are the most
overpowered, with probably mages second. My friend's 15yo brother just
levelled his mage to 34 in a staggeringly short period of time. He's done a
bare fraction of the reading we had done about the game and still asks
obscenely stupid questions - but I'll never forget the time he complained
that he couldn't find any red cons to kill. To an SK of any level I've been
at, in many cases even with a full group, red means stay away. I hear
beastlords can solo reds for many levels also.

    I think a pet class would be more powerful than droods in that respect
because pets do damage to any conned mob, whereas reds tend to resist a lot.

    Just my opinion, don't have all the facts, not a doctor of EQ lore, yes
others no doubt know better, look forward to them sharing their wisdom.

Cheers,
James
