Ya know people say this all the time... but as a cleric is a group fighting
real adversaries... I find it exciting. I was in a full group the other day,
and we got a tough pull... everyone including me was at 50% health, 5 mobs
on us, enchanter doing all he could to mez the adds, Me with mana for 2 good
heals and 3 peoples health dropping. I had to watch very carefully and
decide who would get a heal at what time to make sure I didn't spend my mana
on someone and then the next person die. I left the wiz at 40% and told him
don't draw aggro, assured the tanks that as soon as I saw them dropping
again I would heal, decides not to heal the ranger that was at 40% health
because he probably wasn't drawing as much aggro as our warrior and SK. laid
a heal on he warrior... waited to see how things were going and cast my last
heal on enchanter when 2 mezzes broke at once.

Yeah, maybe you think that was boring... But as I was sitting there, I
realized, no other class could have saved the group but a cleric. I was in
total control over whether My group lived or died at that point.
