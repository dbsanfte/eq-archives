You can find just about all the info there is on these 3 sites:

allakhazam's, caster's realm, eqatlas

This newsgroup is actually the best source for current info (or rumors) if
you can get past some of the ego's here <g>.

You must be lvl46+ to enter all the planes except for PoK.  PoT is a neutral
plane with entrances to other planes.  They are broken into tier1, tier2,
etc.  I believe you must be "flagged" by being part of a raid group to enter
the tiers after tier1.  I'm sure others here can give more details on
getting "flagged".  The planes are mostly for the lvl60+ crowd.
