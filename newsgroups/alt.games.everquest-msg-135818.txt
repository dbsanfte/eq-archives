Go to Nexus zone.  Turn your clip plane down to zero, and move
to the Bazaar zone line.  Write down all your current equipment stats.
Cross your fingers. Zone in.  Look at the floor.  Move a bit to make
sure you aren't blocking the zone line while you study the situation.
You won't have to fight anything in here, so your near blind,
footstaring, laggy as all Brell condition shouldn't hurt too much

Now type /bazaar

Search for items by wis, cleric, your class, one slot at a time.

Unless there is only one of a given item, you should be able
to get a handle on normal price ranges, since you aren't familiar
with price ranges, don't buy anything there aren't four or more
of listed, to prevent someone doing some scamming by cornering
the market on an item and setting up artificially high prices.

Unlike normal human endeavor, though, something that seems
too good to be true may very well be true anyway... quite often
you will see someone dumping junk (to them) at prices well
below the norm.  See an item that is an obvious upgrade to
one you have, at 5000, 4000, 4500, 3500, 200?  Buy the
200 one!

By setting up to filter for your class and race, you will eliminate
all the items you can't use at all.
