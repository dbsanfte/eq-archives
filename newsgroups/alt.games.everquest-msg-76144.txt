Well only a few places in Norath, but on Kunark and Velious and even Luclin
most Guards will take you out. Most camps will take you out. So wolf form is
used there only as a pull em.

The number of times Ive ran to the guards on Kunark and WACK Im dead hehehe.
Mind you it should be that way, who in their right mind would let wolfs roam
freely in their cities?
