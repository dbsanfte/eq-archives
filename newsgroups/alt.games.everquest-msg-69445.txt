I'm using the Trilogy so I have everything except Luclin (and plan to
keep away from that for a while!). I haven't been on in a couple days
but am going to try to get on tonight. My primary goal tonight is to hit
level 8 (half a bubble or less away). Then I'm going to do a bit more
exploring. I add people that I have enjoyed grouping with to my
"friends" list but then I never seem to run into them again! I think I
do pretty well in a group. As a paladin, I make sure that I do the load
of fighting and taunting to absorb the damage while protecting the
spellcasters, even doing a quick Lay on Hands in the middle of battle if
I see someone needs it critically. However, my group experience at
Crushbone the other night was a nightmare and is what has prevented me
from already being level 8. I must've died at least 3 times in there. I
was in a group where the spell casters would see orcs and just charge up
and start pounding on them, leaving me to have to go in and try to save
them from 3 orc legos, etc. And my framerate for some reason was getting
very bad in there so I was having a hard time just being able to target
anything. I have the same problem in cities where if I face a certain
structure my framerate gets really chopping. Someone told me it's
because I only have a 16 MB graphics card and if that's the reason I'll
probably buy a new one so I can be more useful instead of trying to find
targets that are warping and chopping all over the place. Phew. Now what
the hell was I talking about? Must've had too much Mountain Dew to drink
today.
