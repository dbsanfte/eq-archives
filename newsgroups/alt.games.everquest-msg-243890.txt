I agree when it comes to major dangerous mobs. But if you're just
trying to clear trash as fast as you can.... I am thinking of Sol Ro
with this. The monks would be bringing a constant stream of mobs and
it seems to last forever. I went to melee if the MT's target was too
close to mezzed mobs to safely shoot, but I had no problems shooting
if I felt the line was definately clear just because its too fucking
annoying to chase the MT around to his new, small target (like a
mephit) among a dozen standing there for hours on end just because
there might be a mezzed mob somewhere near the raid. 99.9% of the time
no problem at all. If they want 100% on that kind of trash... nah.

I am not going to stop shooting just because there's some mob
somewhere in the zone that's mezzed. If the target gets close to it,
yes. If its close to *me*, yes (or rather I will move). Maybe when I
get melee weapons to actually come close to my archery output things
will change, but not right now.
