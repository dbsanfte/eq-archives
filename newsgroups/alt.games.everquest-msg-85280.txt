What polls and what players?  The majority of EQ players are in their 
mid-20s, according to everything I've seen.  (The most recent is the 
economic study of Norrath that was mentioned here and on every single fan 
site in the past two weeks.)

A good gaming computer costs about twice as much as a good general purpose 
computer.  You can build a good general purpose computer for around $500 
exclusive of software, and purchase the same computer from a retailer, 
with software and licenses, for around $1000.  A computer tricked out with 
768Meg of RAM and a GeForce3 and fast drives and the top sound card etc 
can be built for around $1000, or purchased for around $2000.  
The cutting edge of the PC industry is driven by gamers.  Games are big 
business, and many of the gamer toys eventually become standard on PCs.  
It wasn't that long ago that a soundcard was uncommon on business PCs, let 
alone a 3d video card.  Now even the POS, won't boot from CD-ROM, IT wet 
dream, idiot-proof IBM business desktops come with decent sound AND a 
16Meg video card.  
How many players do you know who have multiple accounts, and computers to 
play 2 or 3 at a time?  I would say a significant minority, probaby 
upwards of 20%, based on my guild and my friends.  These folks are paying 
close to $40/month as it is, and it doesn't seem to be causing them a lot 
of concern.
If you're an active player, who likes interaction, maybe $40/month isn't 
such a big deal.  Compare that to the several hundred dollars in upgrades 
to run SoL, the fees for broadband access, your $60/month cable bill, your 
overall entertainment expenses, etc, and it doesn't look that expensive.  
Hell, grabbing a couple beers with friends costs $40 most of the time, and 
a night out is significantly more.
I suspect that Verant will get the 2% of the playerbase they're looking 
for.  I sincerely hope they produce a good product, though I suspect that 
no matter how good it is, they will be crucified for not doing everything 
every possible customer wants on the one hand, and for offering more 
content on the premium service on the other hand.

It is his money.  It's also his decision.  Claiming his argument is 
worthless is the height of stupidity, since it's his money.
