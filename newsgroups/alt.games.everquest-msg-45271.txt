    At some point, VI will decide, "OK - THIS is the max AC this race of
Warrior can have. No items with a greater AC in any of these slots can be
made which are WAR-usable, period." Why? Because then they can actually TUNE
encounters, knowing exactly how much DPS the best warriors will be taking.
That's important if you don't want the game to get sillier and sillier, with
yesterday's uber mobs becoming the ten second jokes of tomorrow. Then you
can truly have a wide variety of "end game" mobs come up with server up,
instead of one long progression of mobs with a peak that will become more
and more crowded as time goes on.

    We also don't yet know the full drop table of AoW. Although I suppose
it's possible all the Flayed Barbarian Skin drops are for monks, I somehow
doubt it. 8)

    Let's hope Luclin makes casters useful for more than buffs and mana
dumps to clerics. Let's hope Luclin helps hybrids find a true role (rangers
are just getting theirs). Let's hope Luclin helps wizards get groups. As
much as you might not want to say it out loud, truthfully, warriors are just
fine as is. They don't need improvement through class changes OR through new
items that increase previous benchmarks for AC, DPS, HPs etc.
