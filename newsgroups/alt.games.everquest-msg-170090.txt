Harm is certainly top of the heap for Xev. No question. And AV has done
quite a bit. And yes, several of them kill warders and *could* kill the
sleeper if they wished.

However, we do seem to lag pretty far behind as to *when* all the
serverwide firsts happen, and they just don't seem to be up there with
Triton and company. And last I heard, there were still a couple unkilled
things on Xev, no? Who's that guy in Acrylia?
