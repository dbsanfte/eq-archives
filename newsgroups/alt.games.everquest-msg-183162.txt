He he.  Like everyone else, had to make a froggie and try it out.

"Frogasaurus" was rejected.  So was "Phrogasaurus", so I ended up as
"Pharkospots".

Cool - a city w/ 400+ frogs running around.  And a newb zone w/ 100+ level
1's running around.  Killed me a couple of spiderlings and some leach-like
thing in Innothule - made level 2!

Only played 1/2 an hour, but had more fun than the last couple of weeks with
Gnardo (38th warrior).

Frogs are cool...

Ribbit.
