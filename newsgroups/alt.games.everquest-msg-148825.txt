A valid point Bizbee...
I was always aware of this 90 day policy, it just hurts a bit when it
actually happens to you.  Because it doesn't mean picking up where you
left of...it means hunting Rats in Freeport all over again. And it
becomes pointless at that point because again, my play style is I take
breaks from the game and move onto other things then come back.

As a consumer- I have the freedom "not to play"...but the game is a
lot of fun, and that's why I keep coming back.  But paying 12.95 a
month when I'm not playing is just a bit hard to justify.

It would be nice to have the option to maybe pay a one time fee to put
characters into storage of some sort.

On a side note: Very strange that when I try to recreate the character
names they supposedly wiped...none of the names are allowed.
