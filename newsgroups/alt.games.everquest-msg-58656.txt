I always use Cannibalize if I have to get an extra heal off.  I use it
often, in other circumstances, but I don't can myself down that far at any
one time.  I usually have some type of regen going, either mine, or from a
druid I often group with, and I will can myself down to 80%, sit (sitting
between casts as well) and med while regenning, when I am close to full
health, can some more.  This way I am not putting my health down so low that
I am in the danger you describe.  Use it in a group, just do so wisely.
