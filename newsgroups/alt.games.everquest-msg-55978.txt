Yep, WC, EK, NRo, QH, RM... and hey,
Everfrost?  Dang it I missed an event entirely!

I don't recall anyone mentioning the place
particularly, other than one comment I thought
was about a -real- GM event, rather than
a temporary zone makover.

Torture me, what was going on in Everfrost,
and what quasi-uber gear was dropping there?
