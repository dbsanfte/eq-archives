EC was deserted when i visited there.

There's now an economy where some people are dumping spider fur cloaks for
100 plat; i remember seeing them go for 1k. Prices have crashed, but i think
people are still making more money overall, because they just would have
sold to vendor. It's a pity the nexus isn't more accessible to new
characters; I'm staring at the prices I'm offering for my items and feel sad
remembering how little i could get for the 50 plat i had been given by a
friend. Theres almost a full set of banded here for that price, not to
mention some items seem to be being dumped for about cost price or even
lower (gold jasper earring 25pp, and i wasn't the cheapest seller of them!)

Still, it's made the game a lot more fun. Whilst people with master level
skills can't make a profit, the ones with 200 + seem to be doing nicely,
which is something to aspire for, and for someone who wants a fungi tunic,
they don't have to run about shouting for it anymore.
