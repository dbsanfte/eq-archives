How do I tell the strength of a weapon or a piece of Armor.  I'm a barbarian
level 3 in wherever that snowey place barbarians are from and I need to find
some tips on how to get better armor and better weapon.  I have a Rusty
battle axe now, is there a weapon that would do me better then this that I
should be looking for?

Thanks.
