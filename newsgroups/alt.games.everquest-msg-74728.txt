Nothing stacks with the innate run speed increases, spells override
them. However, It doesn't work in the way that person thinks. 3 points
seems to make you just a bit under Tboots or Jboots speed. 

Its not meant to be something you use instead of a running speed spell
or item but instead increase your speed when you have no such things
or can't use them. The specific advatages are in indoor areas where
you could not use sow or running speed items anyway.
