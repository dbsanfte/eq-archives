Yep, been in since the GFAY newb quests for rangers or whomever.
It doesn't seem to matter that people know, no one still loots them in
CB. I ran around with a troll sk beating down CB orcs and also looting
the abandoned scalps.

Its really probably the best way to raise freep militia right now. You
also only need to raise it to dubious, at which point deathfist orc
belts in freeport raise it fast.

Wolf form will raise you one whole step, to the milita for the
deathfist belt quest - at a point. So when you are threaten you might
be dubious while in wolf form. If you are still threaten, turn in a
bunch more scalps in highhold then go try again. My dark elf only had
to turn in a few more to be dubious while in wolf form, then turned in
the 25 or so deathfist belts she had on her. At that point she no
longer needed a druid's help because she was dubious while in the one
use halfling form (halfling form mask quest) so used that when she got
a bunch more belts (was still threaten as dark elf) That did it.
