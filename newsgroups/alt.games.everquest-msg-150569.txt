I'm trying to figure out how much mana I have.  Problem is that either I
don't understand how the mana calculator at http://eq.castersrealm.com works
or it doesn't work.
    I am LV24, have 134 base INT, 39+ INT due to items, +20 Mana (+10 from
robe, and I think 10 from Stein of Moggok).  I cast my LV20 pet spell (don't
got 24 yet, research only, don't got all parts, how much to buy it?).  That
spell costs 200 mana, and only drains 1 bubble, showing I must have about 1K
mana.
    I thought the mana calculation method was "MANA=LV*INT/5" (at least up
to 200 INT, then each additional INT was a different value after 200).
    Here is what the website shows.  Can someone explain?

Your Current Level Is: 24

The Base Intelligence For Your Char Is: 134

Your Base Mana At This Level Is: 691

Your Modified Intelligence Is Now: 39

Your Modified Mana At This Level Is: 235

Extra Mana As A Result Of Modifiers Is: -456

Is it saying I've got 1145 Mana?
Using my above formula I should have 830.4 which also doesn't appear correct
(don't think it does anyway).
