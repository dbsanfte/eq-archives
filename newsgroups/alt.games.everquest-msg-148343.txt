Well some spells are double checked against multiple resistances, any
failure negates entire spell. Good example is Breath of Ro, (hope my
memory serves) which is checked on both magic and fire. There are
others to be sure. Most spells only check one resist, root for example
uses magic. Dont know exact formulas sorry. Gets complex dont it :)
