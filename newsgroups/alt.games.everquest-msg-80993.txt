Or if you do, just be careful to do it near the middle
of the span, over water.

I've jumped off it several times and splashed down
(after a long free-fall) and taken zero damage.  It's
quite a rush, especially if you watch yourself
plummet using an F9 third-person view.

On the other hand, I fell off it accidentally over
the land portion of the bridge, and hit for 10,000 damage...
So don't do that.
