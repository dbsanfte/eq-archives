I'd say SK or ranger is your best bet. Both can fear kite targets, and
both have utility spells to make many aspects of the game easier for a
soloist, i.e. invis, FD, sow, find corpse, track, etc...

Pally is ok, but not as good for soloing cause they can't fear kite.
Pally is possibly more attractive to groups with their healing
ability.
