on Tarew Marr, this one is referred to as the POD lift.
the newbie lift is the first lift that you'll see when travelling from
Felwithe to Kelethin. (follow the path from the pod lift to the right, and
you'll find the newbie lift)
not that this was asked, but the orc lift is the one near orc hill, in front
of the path to crushbone.
