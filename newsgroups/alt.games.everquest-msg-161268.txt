Yep I am a lev 15 Pal and a level 10 Shammy. Way to low for POP.

However the ports for me makes the game far more fun. As well as the 
Plane of Knowledge that all low levels can go to safely which has every 
item you could possibly want to buy from a vendor as well as every 
spell, book, you name it.

Absolutely great :) For me Plane of Knowledge is a great addition and 
another justification
