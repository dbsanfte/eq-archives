I like the idea, but I dont see why increasing the group bonus means they
need to be nerfing ZEMs.  With that part of this change, its like they are
nerfing solo xp to make grouping more attractive, that is the wrong way to
go about it.

I also think that these changes arent going to help classes that have
trouble getting groups get into them more often.  It might a little, seeing
as how under these rules taking on a 6th character is never a penalty (well
I guess it could be if the player really sucked...), but overall I dont
think it will have much of an effect in that area, which is where EQ needs a
lot of work.
