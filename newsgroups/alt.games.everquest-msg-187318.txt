A 1, however, would be assumed to be a default.

What is the formula? Can you please show me the chunk of c code that 
calculates and applies it?

No? Fuck off.

So E=MC^2 defines relativity? One can understand the concept without 
knowing the precise formula.

I assumed he meant "a non-default ZEM". You, on the other hand, were 
hunting for a deep green nit to pick.

...and if he ever does, somehow, agree to play your silly semantic game, 
your self worth will no doubt increase, raising you even higher above 
everyone else.

I have seen much more of value from Ben Sisson than I have from your whiny 
little flame-attempts (and before you ask, I cannot quantify that with a 
precise formula, but I suspect it has a multiplier with 10^4 or more 0's in 
it(to the left of the decimal, natch))
