I've been finding that the F8 key has become very unreliable lately.  It
will very often refuse to target any mob at all, even though the stupid mob
is fighting right in front of me.  As for Assist, I do keep that hotkeyed,
and set to the MA.  Still, even as a shaman, I sometimes have to do root
park crowd control, and it can be very difficult to target with too many
corpses lying around.  OTOH, I have a fairly regular group, and we do master
looting.
