Since I actually read his post let me point out. his rant was not about sony
patching, it was about them patching at the same time every day for the last
3 days.

I understand where hes coming from cause this effects me too, altho this
morning's patch was no where near as long as they told us it would be, I was
pleasantly surprised. but im still a super late night/early morning person
and every single patch effects me too, so I understand his concerns.
