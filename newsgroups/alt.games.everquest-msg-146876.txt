Bring up the AA screen.  If you are using the new interface, using Verant's
skin, you do that by bringing up inventory, and and hitting the button
labeled "alt adv" (or something like that).  I forget how you do it with the
old interface--check the manual in your EQ directory.

On the AA screen, there will be something that lets you set AA from 0% to
100%.  Set it to something other than 0%, and whenever you kill things for
XP (does it also work for quest XP?  I don't know), that percentage of the
XP goes toward AA.  You'll also see on the AA screen an AA XP bar.  Whenever
you fill that, you get one AA point.

It takes about as much XP to fill the AA bar as it takes to complete level
51.

I am pretty sure they are confusing level with points.  It should be one
point per level, so 6 points gets you +3 mana.

Note that you can't buy increased mana regen until you are level 55.

To figure out what to take, first take a look at the Shaman archetype AA
abilities.  Some of those will have prerequisites, so if you want those,
getting the prerequisites would be good. :-)

The general AA abilities are mostly not very useful, except for runspeed,
which pretty much everyone takes 3 levels of.  Yes, even SOW classes--it
works in dungeons and cannot be dispelled.

One final thing: you probably don't need to do any AA XP yet.  Generally,
leveling up is more useful than gaining AA abilities, so many people don't
turn on AA XP until they hit 60.  However, if you need to hold back on
leveling (e.g., you want to stay under 53, so you can do Vox and Naggy, then
turning on AA at the end of 52 is a good way to do that).
