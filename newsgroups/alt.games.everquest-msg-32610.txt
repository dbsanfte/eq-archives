It doesn't even have to be over an item slot, anywhere at
all within the bounding rectangle of the open container will
work.

You can even slightly overlap two containers (e.g., the bottom
edge of one overlapping the top edge of the other), and then
alt-hover your mouse over the place where they overlap to
get labels for BOTH containers simultaneously.  Every once
in a while I like to do this so that I can get a record of
all my current bank contents in only 4 screenshots.
