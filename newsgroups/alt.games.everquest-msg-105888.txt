  Hybrids don't generally NEED Clarity or Breeze... but those spells only
cost 35 and 75 mana respectively and last a pretty good length of time.
That's not exactly a huge amount of mana.  If I'm not pulling, I don't
generally care if I have Clarity or Breeze or not... but if I am, I like to
have it because I'm getting virtually no chance to meditate. Sure, my spells
don't suck up as much mana as a wizard or a cleric's, but I don't even get
1/5 the meditation time.

  I could use my spells sparingly and have no fear of becoming a bottleneck,
but what is a shadow knight who doesn't use his spells?  A lame warrior.  I
feel I'm at my best when I don't feel as if I have to try too hard to ration
my mana.  I try not to run a big "mana deficit", Clarity or no, so for me
it's just the difference between me doing some supplemental damage and
ending the fights a little quicker, or not.  Or keeping a mob snared the
entire fight, or only snaring near the end.  I'll do better if I have the
mana, but if an enchanter wants to withhold mana because they're "low on
it", I guess that's their perogative.
