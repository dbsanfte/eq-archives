Some ldon mobs are unsnarable, but those ones generally dont run (usually
animal mobs, probably made unsnarable to add risk to charming).

Dispell is a pretty visual spell (if you have any effects on), and everyone
would be seeing worn off messages if that was happening, also its unlikely
to happen that often :)

Depending on his level, he was either using snare or ensnare (about 2.30 for
first, 15 mins for second), even with normal snare its unlikely it would run
out before the mob died.

Resists, possible, would depend when he was snaring, I generally begin to
snare at 40%, for less aggro, but also giving time for recasts if snare is
resisted (usually do first attempt with clicky snare).  If you get a few
resists you can get aggro, in this case i reattempt snare until it sticks
then jolt, rather than ping ponging with jolt / snare.  Again that would
depend if the ranger had jolt (level 51).

So to sum up, he was probably lying, why he would lie, who knows :)
