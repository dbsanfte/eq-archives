As is typically the case, I was main looter for our pickup LDoN group. I
ran into a situation I wasn't prepared to handle so I thought I'd come
here to see what folks thought.

We looted some of those LDoN tradeskill items -- mistmoore graveyard dust
and essence of moonlight. I've seen folks auctioning that they want to buy
them, so I'm guessing they're worth more than the 9gp a merchant will give
me for them (5pp each?). But I didn't have a good feel for how much they
should be worth, nor did I have the cash to front the group for selling
them myself, nor did I think it effective to ask the group at the time.
Folks were antsy about getting their share so they could log *now*, and I
was antsy about getting away from The World's Most Annoying Cleric (tm),
and my brain froze.

What's a useful course, for when this (inevitably) happens in the next
LDoN pickup group, for dealing with items that sell to players, but not
instantaneously?
