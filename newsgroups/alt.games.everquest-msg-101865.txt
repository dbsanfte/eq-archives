    So I guess my name is Anna, then.  That is what my parents told them to put
on my birth certificate, after all.  Oh, they never _called_ me Anna.  They, and
everyone else, has always called me "Annie".  I think of myself as "Annie", and
always have.  I even had my name legally changed, just to keep the various
pieces of paperwork that will follow me though out my life straight.  My drivers
and marriage licenses, Social Security card, and employee ID all say "Annie". 
But it's sad that I don't use "Anna", since it's just a nickname and all.  
   Glad you set me straight on that.

Annie <--- Doesn't like "plz" or "crack", but doesn't like being told her name
is sad, either.
