Grasping roots, in a word, suck. I never even tried to root dot till I
got ensnaring roots, and I am still using ensnaring roots at 52 - even
though I have an upgrade to the slow cast-long last root in the level
49 engulfing roots, resists became enough of an issue to switch to the
cheaper level 24 spell while I was soloing in DL. I guess I could try
switching it back now that I am not hunting cockatrices :) (I *want*
level 56 and the root upgrade!)

Also, I've had more resists to roots than to ensnare. And of course
there's the crowd pleaser: the root that sticks for half a second :)

The dots also get pretty powerful. I soloed a bit last night (feh) and
was killing Spiroc Provens (low blue at 52) with 2 casts of drifting
death and one cast of Breath of Ro. I also cast snare, ensnaring roots
once or twice, and ro's fiery sundering to make my fire dot stick. I
use quite a bit less than half my mana bar, and the mob dies within
two and a half minutes of me casting damaging spells. At 50, I would
use drifting death and root on dreadlands ragers, and melee down the
last little bit if root broke before they died (otherwise, toss
starfire or dizzying wind on them) and would end a fight with the same
mana level I started it with if I didn't have too many resists.

I used that when I soloed at your level; in the mid 20s I found that
mobs hit a bit too hard. At 29, what little solo work I did was root
dotting Paw Spire Gnolls with stinging swarm and immolate.

Have I mentioned I hate soloing and think quad kiting sounds
incredibly tedious? :)
