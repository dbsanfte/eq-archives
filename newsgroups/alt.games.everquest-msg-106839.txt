Absolutely so. If it is a Ath 1.4 as opposed to an Ath XP, then they
generate enormous heat and also draw power furiously. I have an Ath 1.4
system and an Ath XP 1600+ (== Ath 1.4) system, both run GeForce 2 Ultra
cards and same MOBO etc etc. I had dreadful problems with the 1.4
spontaneously restarting but only running EQ. (Incidentally the harder you
drive a graphics card the more heat it generates - as EQ drives graphics
much harder than most other games, that is why it is more prone to this kind
of problem). I had 3 EXTRA fans in the 1.4 case: Intake at the front bottom,
outtake just below the PSU and level with the CPU, and a card-type outtake
below the graphics card. And I still had the problem. You could feel that
the side of the case of the 1.4 was much warmer than the XP when both were
playing EQ. And removing the case of the 1.4 solved the problem.

In the end I replaced the power supply with an expensive dual-fan Enermax
350w - it has a second fan "underneath" that draws heat direcly off the CPU
and blasts it out of the back of the PSU - now the air behind the case is
warmer but the case itself is cooler, and touch Wood Elf it hasn't shut down
once since. And the additional power available means the fans run more
constantly when under load.

Note that if you have lots of other devices in the machine, CD-Writers and
so forth, then going up to the 431w version of the PSU would be a good
thing.

Hope this helps.
