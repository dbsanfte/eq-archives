I also have a second chat window for tells and group chat, however I have a 
different issue.  I have both windows set to fade to transparent a few 
seconds after the window gets a message.  However, after about 2 hours of 
playing, the second window no longer fades to transparent even though 
there's no new messages in it.

Perhaps this problem will also be addressed in the upcoming patch.
