You have to continually feed them. Tribute is a bit of a pain imo because:

a) In order to choose benefits, turn them on, or increase their intensity,
you have to go back to your hometown and visit your tribute master; and
b) You have to have a very large pool of favor in order to be able to keep
these benefits fed.

Yeah, the benefits are nice. But after a couple of weeks of playing around
with them I stopped and haven't been back since.
