Keeping a group alive is not the same as keeping a group fighting efficiently.
Mana cost on "real" heals sucks compared to CHeal (and the Inc heals) which is
where you run into trouble, not keeping people alive, but keeping them from
sitting on their cans waiting for the druid to get mana up again.

The reason I said up to 50, is that Cheal isn't really all that much more mana
efficient than "real" heals until somewhere around that point, so druids are
only a bit less efficient than clerics, and thats going to be offset by the
presence of the shaman as second healer, spreading the mana cost around (plus
slows save TONS of healing mana)

Rez is something I've never really had to live without, my alts are of so low a
level that exp loss is negligible, and both are very effective exp generators,
so making back the loss is trivial.  Getting back to the bodies easily is a
bonus, of course.

Backup healers are not a mana question, efficiency in them comes from keeping
people alive, thus saving the mana you'd spend on rezing and buffing back up.
Paladins slapping out 660 points to every member of the group in a hurry can
often make the difference between live and dead.  Celestial healing isn't a
backup healer plan, as its slow; its a way of spreading some of the healing
costs out in case the main healer is running low and you have lots of mana.

Two classes get the majority of paladin heals; paladins (who will take self rez
rather than bother looking for a better cleric heal a lot more often than non
rezing classes will look for a paladin in zone to take care of them) and
clerics, who get pally rez and then procede to cleric rez the rest of their
group.
