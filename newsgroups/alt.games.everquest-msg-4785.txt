I was sitting in the Rivervale bank with my Research mule (holds all my
Words, Pages, Runes, etc.) .. WATCHING the inventory, for three ticks I saw
his newbie food and drink go down by one. 18 seconds. *boggle*

I also was unable to forage fast enough to feed myself. I keep my food like
this:

WATER        ROOTS
VEGGIES     BERRIES
RABBIT        FRUIT

Foraging every time it came up (It's on my main hotkey screen, can't miss
it) .. I went through all my Roots, all my Veggies, and half of my Berries.
Scary. Since the latest patch, I've restocked my Berries, have half a stack
of Roots, and about 6 Vegetables. Water's a bit low .. about 15 iirc. I
normally foraged enough to keep all six stacks full at 20, which leads me to
believe that "drink"-class drinks and "meal"-class foods do NOT last the
same amount of time as everything used to.

Paladin Pickles passed out during a re-Naggy raid today (woo) .. I *THINK*,
but I'm not *SURE*, that the only way to get the benefits of the food if
it's the FIRST food in your inventory. Can be anywhere, but it has to be the
food your character will eat.
