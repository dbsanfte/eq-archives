Woot! I soloed 4 SGs in Oasis last night.

After finding one (the hard part), I:
cast Malaise,
send in highest lvl earth pet w/ dmg shield,
nuke (avg 330 w/ focus),
pet heal,
nuke,
pet heal,
nuke,
pet heal.....dead SG <g>.

I would end up with about 1.5-2.0 bubs of mana left and pet at about 10-20%
health.  I had 1 Malaise and 1 Blaze totally resisted.  I had 2 of my nukes
partially resisted (one only did 7pts dmg...doh!).

It was pretty thrilling to solo an SG but....the loot sucked.  The first 3 I
killed had 1pp, 4pp, 5pp and change.  The 4th one had 19pp and change.  I
see now why people say it isn't worth the effort (manawise) to solo these.

Thanks to the folks at the docks, I had mind buffs and SoW (just in case).

I think I'll wait till 44 (new pets, spells) to try HGs.  I'm not sure I'd
be able to handle one of those right now.
