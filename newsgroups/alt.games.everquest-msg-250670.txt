Have a look at all the bad names 
in EQ,for example I saw a player today named "Pedarasta".

What about all these buff beggars in PoK,begging for
buffs for CR(corpse retrieval).When was the last time
you did a corpse rertieval?IMHO these are all liars.

And whats up with all these auctions without  price ?
People are too lazy to type a price or just forget it?
If you ask me a good portion of these are trying to scam
the unsuspecting.

I dont think the players of EQ are any better than in UO.

Whats different is ,that the game mechanics in UO allow
players easier than in EQ to ruin others fun.
True,it took the developers of UO some years to fix
most of the exploits and rampart PKIng(Trammel),but 
MMORPGs were totally new,no one had experience
with it.
But even when PKing was allowed everywhere,me and 
my friends always could find a place with interesting loot
to play undisturbed.

I played UO from 1998 to Autumn 2002,and EQ since
2000,alternating between these two.I left UO,cause
I was burned out,playing it nearly every day for 4 years.
