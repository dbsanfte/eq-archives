Actually, I think it is like the person who quits smoking, and now all
the smokers are LESS THAN the former smoker, and he will point it out
to the smokers at every opportunity.

I run a successful computer repair business, have LOTS of genuine real
world friends, and I know some EQ players in real life. I am sure we
obsessed on the game for a while, but we got over it. It has become a
pleasant diversion, with lots of eye candy and interesting things to
do, both solo and in groups and guilds.

NONE of us need self-righteous pompous blowhards to tell us how to
live our lives. I for one, choose to play Everquest more this time of
year because I live in Alaska where it is cold and dark outside for
several months out of the year.

I know I am likely feeding a troll here.
