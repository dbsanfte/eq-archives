I just started playing EQ and have gotten my troll warrior up to level 5. I
am having a bit of trouble on a quest that I am undertaking.. I need to get
4 spore mushrooms. The problem is, after gaining 4 levels I have run into
exactly 2 of the little bastards. Are all quests this hard ? And what
monsters have the best chance of dropping a spore mushroom. The Fungus man
trakers (risky kill) or the little mushroom guys (name escapes me at the
moment.)? Thanks in advance for any help.

Grogbut.
