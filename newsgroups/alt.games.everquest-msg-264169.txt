I signed up with teranews.com for their 50mb a day account, I use it for 
binaries fills, they tend to have a very good retention/completion. 
their webserver is down atm though, which is not a good sign, sigh

The good thing about the 50 mb a day account is that it is free after 
the $10 or whatever it was signup fee. (want to say it was like $7.95 
but not sure). I've been quite satisfied with what I have had since I've 
had it though.
