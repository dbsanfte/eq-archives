Hard to say, if you want to upgrade then it would probably help because it
sounds like something is wrong with with your system that an OS upgrade

But, thousands of people are running win98 with no problem, so if you don't
want to upgrade then maybe you can post some more specific info and maybe
others in the NG will suggest something to fix your problem....
