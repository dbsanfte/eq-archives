totally disagree.  for the most part high levels have the most access to do
whatever they want.  They can go anywhere and do anything they want.  If you
want loot that has TCC on it, just powerlevel someone for that item.  There
is no better feeling than to walk into a zone and feel safe and secure =>
and not feel like your going to die from something you have no chance to
deal with but to run away.

The no drop items is what limits item distribution big time, not TCC rules.
Also if TCC gets to the point where you do not have good work arounds,
unless its no drop you could always pharm items that don't have TCC rules
and trade for them.

Luclin is going to be doing a ton more for the 50th to 60th levels.  looking
forward to the new metal for jewelry crafting, and the new demand it will
create.

Someone else also mentioned about twinking, and how it should be that you
cannot twink. It created a whole new demand for items.  If you got 8 chars
you need 8 sets of equipment.  Also you definitely don't have to twink your
chars, and if you just cannot resist twinking, you could always go to a new
server and start fresh.  There is also code on some (if not all, am unsure
on this) PvP servers to only allow one char per account.  That seems like a
big deal if you play on those servers.
