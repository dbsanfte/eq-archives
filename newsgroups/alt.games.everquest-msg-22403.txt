I think the amount of mobs spawning does relate to the amount of players. I
hunt in the nektolous forest which is damn near empty late at night and early
morning and theres ne'er a mob to be seen. With other characters ive hunted in
freeport and qeynos hills, two of the busier hunting grounds and they're never
short of mobs (particulary freeport). It took a little getting used to, running
around your newb hunting ground chasing for the odd fire beetle like it was a
rare spawn but you do get to know the zone 'very' well. Oh how i missed my
rangers Track ;)
