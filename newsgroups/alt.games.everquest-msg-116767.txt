Why limit us?  There are 168 hours in a week.  If you work 40 of them, plus
an extra hour for lunch those 5 days (I know some only get 30 minutes, but
figuring max time here).  Then that leaves 123 hours remaining.  Assume
about 30-35 minutes per day to get to and from work (30-35 minutes including
both trips to and from).  That leaves about 120 hours.  If you need 6 hrs
sleep, 7 days, then you've got 78 hours left per week for EQ.
