Actually larger HDD's are faster (of the same model etc), but whether you
would notice this difference is another matter.

To original poster:

Western Digital 800JB is about the best HDD around at the moment.

If pre-built, good luck to ya, its likely to have a bad mobo and generic
ram, but if you dont know how to put a pc together and dont know anyone who
can, a pre-built is probably the best way.

About the RAM, its likely he said this because the pre-built system he is
trying to sell you doesnt have a motherboard that can support PC2700, u can
now also get PC3200 (400mhz) and PC3500 (434mhz), on my system I am getting
PC2700 (333mhz), as it is cheaper and there are more motherboards that can
support it (the mobo I am getting can support PC3200 but crucial dont make
it yet and I dont trust anyone but Corsair or Crucial, and Corsair is too
much money :)  ).
