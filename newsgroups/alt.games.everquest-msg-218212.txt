Are you sure about this?  I've heard from multiple people (including
one inside SOE) that damage caps on Sk's and Paladins exist until lvl
55 or so.  The damage cap drops the higher the level but still exists,
whereas the warrior has absolutely none after lvl 20.

I just want total clarification on this as I'm getting other reports
that this cap makes a significant difference.

Thanks.
