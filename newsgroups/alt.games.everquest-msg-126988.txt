    A fair while ago but after Charm was disabled on the Zeks I was able to
charm people in a PvP-enabled area (arena in WFP) on a blue server. Boy, was
that dwarven rogue surprised when his wife the druid started blowing him to
kingdom come. ;-) I think that might be the only place Charm works in PvP,
since XP deaths are supposed to be disabled in those areas.
