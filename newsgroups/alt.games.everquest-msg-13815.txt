This brings to mind an interesting real life example.  When you walk into a
Blockbuster Video Store, don't you just HATE IT when all the workers drop
what they are doing and focus on you to make sure they say hello and welcome
you?  Sure it is being polite, but that has to be one of the most annoying
things in life.  Then again, I am sure my opinion regarding both uninvited
inspections and blockbuster is influenced by my surroundings and how I was
raised.  Growing up in NYC, everyone is a stranger and no one has time (or
patience) to stop and chat and befriend people, etc.  People who have grown
up in small towns and such are a totally different breed and make me quite
uncomfortable because I am not used to that type of behavior. ;)
