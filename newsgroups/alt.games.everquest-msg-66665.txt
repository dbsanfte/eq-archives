Its a known issue which verant still seems to be partway denying.

No one without luclin installed is seeing kitty people. Everyone i've
bumped into could not see my kitty unless luclin was installed. 
Even checking all files won't help.

Thread on everquest message board about it:

I don't see why verant can't test that and see the same thing. These
guys all have the correct files but the display of the kitty is just
not set to ON basically.
