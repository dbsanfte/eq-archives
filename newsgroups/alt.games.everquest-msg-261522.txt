Recently killed Eldig with a bard friend as a 56 berzerk.

Spawning him is nearly impossible solo, because his PH wanders around 
and can be pretty much any of the hundreds of mobs between OT and BW.

With a partner, though, a sufficiently high level bard can run around 
using Highsun on every mob in the area, zoning out occaisionally to 
clear aggro (because he's making dozens of mobs really hate him with 
that trick, then running around thru their spawn and wander area)

Meanwhile, the confederate sits at the spawn site for Edrig and watches; 
when the bard highsuns the PH it pops at the spawn site, no other mob 
does, nor ever wanders nearby.

Kill the PH, then keep an eye on the spawn site and kill any mob there 
(I think the spawn time was about 12 minutes but really wasn't paying 
attention, it was -not- the 18 minutes I'd remembered reading about 
somewhere, but I couldnt' find my copy of the writeup and my friend 
hadn't printed that part out, not expecting to do it anytime soon)

When Eldrig finally popped, he turned out to be nasty business, a named 
summoning chromdrac.  Not just an ordinary Chromo, either, he procced 
his dispell with a frequency to make a 65 cleric's hammer look lame, it 
might well have been Every hit.  I eventually gave up trying to defend 
my buffs using an insta click off my staff, since swapping it in for my 
sword, clicking, and swapping back out was costing me DPS and I was 
still gradually losing buffs anyway.

The summoning was of minimal concern, even when HP got low enough that 
getting some range open to regen became an issue; he'd only get one blow 
in per summon before we could back out of range, as he wasn't keeping 
the snare off.

We started with a charmed pet, but he dispelled the charm, not a good 
plan.  We did some melee, but as the buffs vanished, the lack of a 
healer (normally my regen buff plus bard regen song would be plenty for 
  a mob hitting like he does, but I couldn't keep the regen up and 
couldn't keep normal buffs on).  Eventually he managed to stick a charm 
on Eldrig, though, and then we had him chew up the former pet and some 
assorted wurms while I regenned, then went in and finished him off.

Of his annoying habits, the summons were the least of our worries, his 
high magic resist (silly bard doesn't have OOS yet) and his astonishing 
chain dispells were far more worrisome; the summons just serve to keep 
you honest because you can't keep bards distance from him and never take 
a hit.  With Run (Selos and SOW and TBoots aren't going to stand up to 
the dispells) AA, though, you don't have to just stand there and take 
it, you can be out of melee range most of the time.

I'd twist OOS, snare, and charm till charm sticks, then take him out and 
run him into the other mobs in the zone (not chromodracs though!) and 
let them do most of the killing.  Or I'd bring a good heavy tank and a 
healer.

Grage, 57 berserk, Luclin
Llyric, 57 bard, Morell Thule (gutless, though, never found someone to 
sit that camp with me long enough to pop the PH)
