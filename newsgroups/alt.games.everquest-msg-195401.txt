Nope, in fact this is only the first or second time I've used it.
But in this case I thought you'd appreciate an easy target to potshot.

Just in case your assertion of what you believe that I believe shows
an interest in acquiring accurate beliefs regarding my beliefs...
[sits down and waits for the spinning to stop]

I am certain that SOE could do better.  OTOH, I believe that, overall,
we have seen the "level" of QA/CS that we will always see.  I quoted
"level" because their results have been uneven, and I am sure they'll
continue to be uneven.  Their corporate effort is dictated by their
understanding of the economics involved, and after 4 years they seem
to be pretty much running on auto-pilot in terms of planning and
commitment (neat!  I was able to say that without resorting to those
icons of evil corporate litany and ritual: "resources" and "process").

So, it's not that things can't improve, but rather that they won't

improve because there's no money in it.
