I spent 7 hrs camping brood mother in GD. She popped   and I handed in harness,
then POOF! shes gone, despawned. I sent a petition, and a report showing text
that i turned it in.  Took 2 hrs for response.  They replaced harness   but
wouls not respawn Broodmother.  "We NEVER respawn a mob by request of a PLAYER,
not matter what, zone crash, bug  , suicide whatever".  However  ,  I have seen
them do it before. Another case of GM inconsistancy
