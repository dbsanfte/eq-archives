(Refs from dictionary.com)

Skill is defined as:

Proficiency, facility, or dexterity that is acquired or developed through
training or experience.
        a) An art, trade, or technique, particularly one requiring use of
the hands or body.
        b) A developed talent or ability: writing skills.

Dexterity really is not required for EQ, although it is in some cases, and
certainly is with a bard.
If you look at Proficiency, a synonym is competence.

Competence is defined as:
  1.. The state or quality of being adequately or well qualified; ability.
  2.. A specific range of skill, knowledge, or ability.
By this definition of skill then, having "lot of nitpicky knowledge required
to play a character well in
some situations:  knowing when and why to perform a particular
series of button presses and/or mouse actions" is:

1. Knowledge
2. Ability.
3. Competence.
4. Proficiency
5. Skill.
