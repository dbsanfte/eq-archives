Another good reason to get a Drog: its head won't block the view like
a horse will.

There is another horse that can run faster and could keep up with high
level Bard's best.  They are only available via AA of either
Shadowknight or Paladin.

I'd suggest a drog over anything anyway.  If you only need to sit for
med without worrying about speed, the 10k version should be OK.  But
if you plan to move a lot, faster drog would probably be better.  You
can find the drog dealer inside the lighthouse in Gulf of Gunthak,
right next to the banker.  Convenient since most people can't walk
around with over 300k anyway.
