Soon you're going to hit the point (level 20, more or less) where
you'll be nearly useless in melee combat, and where your spell casting
abilities will really start to shine.

This means that you should start focusing on armor that has WIS
attributes. Things like the Runed Circlet, Braided Ivy Cords, Mammoth
Hide Cloak and similar items. Check www.eqdruids.com for ideas, and
figure that anything that comes from the Old World will probably have
depreciated enough in cost that you'll be able to afford it.
