}As I seem to recall.  There were 10 rules set in stone to govern behavior of
}it's peoples as a whole.
}The 10 commandments.
}Look beneath all the varios groups of Laws that govern most nations of
}Cristian origian, and you will find those 10 hidden behind them, guiding and
}holding them up.
}Look at the laws regarding murder..  It is against the law...period.  Look
}below the surface.
}THOU SHALT NOT KILL.

Except in self-defense, if the state has authorized the use of capital 
punishment, in the service of the military under orders, if the patient 
has signed a living will specifying discontinuation of their life 
support in certain circumstances, er...  right... um... period.

}Laws regarding marrige.

Hm, only law regarding marriage in the ten commandments is the one against 
adultery.  I'd support getting rid of all the others we've passed.

}Theft.
}All of them.
}The 10 commandment should be kept in full view.  They are the basis of our
}laws.

Sorry, I missed the bit where we have a law against the worship of graven 
idols or having any other god before whatsisname...

They may have been original source material, but hey, with such 
handy-dandy laws floating around, what the heck did we need a congress 
for?  Surely we weren't planning on writing any other laws...

If you look, the Wiccan Rede and our laws also have a lot in common.  They 
are both religious, and I would not accept forcing either of them on 
others in a public institution like the courts.

}Those who take the seperation of church and state to the extreme it is being
}held to today are those that hate laws, rules, anything that get's in their
}way of their wants.

It's not that extreme, I'm afraid.  Yours is not the only church.  Yours 
is not the only church that has rules  like the ten commandments.  The ten 
commandments are not the only rules with merit.  

}Religion was the binding that made todays America possible.

Well... that, and that we arrived on a huge tract of resource-rich land 
that was easily hoodwinked or stolen by force from its native population.  
And remember, the original settlers were not all of the same faith, they 
were of quite a diversity of faiths.  Predominantly some stripe of 
Christian or other, granted.

}The leaders of the ACLU is run by followers of anti Americans in certain 
}areas.  

Disagreeing with you does not make someone anti-American.

}Remember, the communist of America cried the day the USSR fell.  They 
}moved into the enviramental groups.

Interesting theory.  Evidence?  I think most American Communists already 
felt that the USSR was a failed experiment.  

}Take away privately owned land.  Take away what you earn and give to the
}non-productive.

Why not?  We're a nation founded on the theft of land.

}If they don't like what you say, it is hate speech.

In some cases, that will be inherently true.  Are you saying that you like 
hate speech?  I don't, particularly.  But I will defend its right to be 
said, in non-riot inducing venues.

}If you like to travel, your car, or SUV is evil.

SUVs -are- evil.  Cars are also evil, but less so.  They pollute.  
Pollution kills wildlife.  Refer to commandment #6.  People drive them on 
Sunday.  See commandment #4.  People swear copiously while driving them.  
See commandment #3.  People practically worship their cars.  Commandments 
#1 & #2.  And people want them very, very badly.  See commandment #10.

}You smoke, attack and tax the people that smoke. ( I don't smoke by the
}way.)

Yes, this is true.  I smoke, and yet vote to increase taxes on my 
filthiest vice.

}Remember, tobaco is only a single facet of those companys.  We all pay for
}the out of control lawers and judges.

Perhaps.  I'm really having trouble seeing what your point is, here...

}I have said enough here.  I will not speak within this thread again, so
}flame away.

Whew.  Thank goodness for small favors.
