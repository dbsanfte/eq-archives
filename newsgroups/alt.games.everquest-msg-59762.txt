"Hi. My names Uxivar, and I'm a questaholic"
(crowd chimes in)
"Hi Uxivar!"

Yes, I've become addicted to the Janem and Rebby note qeusts in FP. At
first it was only once in a while, like one circuit when I'd come back
to town to sell. And besides...... I *needed* to do it so I could get to
where I'd be able to sell to/from all the merchants. And I could quit
whenever I wanted.

*sigh*

But now, if I know I only have an hour or so to play and I'm near FP, I
won't bother even trying to go hunt, and just bind myself in front of
those two idiots and make the run to the tunnels and do it over and
over. Even worse, I've come up with an "excuse" for it. I realized that
I was spending WAY too much time and mana fizzling whenever I started a
new hunting session when I went to buff myself and the pet with Spirit
Armor and Shielding on me. My abjuration skill was about 13 when all my
"battle spell" skills were near max in the 85/90 range. So, I made a
hotkey to practice my lowest level, lowest mana abjuration and evocation
spells over and over (both skills sucked) and I'd sit in front of Janem
and Rebby and cast it until I drained my mana bar. Then, I'd cast dark
pact and rather than sitting to med up I'd "pass the time" running to
the tunnels, gating back, and doing the quests again. I'm already kindly
to all the merchants, and indifferent to the militia, so there's NO
REASON to keep wasting time doing this quest! But, damnitall, I want to
see the militia LIKE ME for some stupid reason.

And lately, I'm getting obsessed with that peasant woman who hangs out
behind Janem and Rebby. What the fuck's her story? She's still dubious
to me. No clue what the hell faction she's on, or if she has a quest to
give, or what. I just know she killed my very first warrior last year
when I was wandering around trying to figure out the game. "Peasant
woman groans weakly as she tries to fill two buckets of water."  Weakly
my ass. She hits in the seventies at least and my warrior was dead
before she could finish yelling "Guards! Guards!"

I need some kind of intervention to send me back out hunting or I'll
never be level 18, say nothing of 20 when I could get my desired, oh so
necro appropriate surname;
Uxivar Fluffybunny
