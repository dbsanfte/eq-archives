If you do buy a new card, don't get a TNT or TNT 2. If you are cash
strapped, you can get a Geforce MX for about the same cost (maybe $10
more), or for another $20-$30 you can get a Geforce 2. You'll probably
be happier with this card anyway and driver support will be ongoing for
a while since Nvidia has pretty much taken over the video card market.
