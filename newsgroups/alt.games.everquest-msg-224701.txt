We have 2 65 bards.  One has RL stuff right now dramatically limiting
his play time, the other is a 2box alt of an english player who has
trouble making evening EST raids.  We're raising a couple of bards on
2nd accounts of frequent raiders, but they haven't hit AE resist song
level yet.

I can tell you that, with all my resist gear on and GoD I get to 280
MR - and I still don't resist that dot.

We had to work on a strat to do him with what we had - and keeping the
12 DPS class OOR of the DoT is the easiest adjustment to make.
