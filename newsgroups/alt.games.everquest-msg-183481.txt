    Ok let me express it a little more mathematically.

    A caster with an extra 14 mana per tick can do more for a group.

    Well, I've never actually kicked anyone out of a group, but having
someone refuse to buff without an explanation would be grounds, except that
if they know what they're doing that would shine through. If someone thought
and put forward a reasoned argument for not supplying the buff I don't think
I'd be a jerk about it :P

    I don't really know what made you post that comment, but for clarity's
sake there is my presponse :P

    Am I commenting on ToV? No. I'm commenting on what my actual experiences
in the game are. Yes, you might have different and higher level experiences,
but that doesn't change the fact that I do have them and they are valid.
Welcome to being a human being, page one: Other people have viewpoints, and
no matter how often you tell them yours is better, it's still a matter of
opinion.

    If you want to argue, argue. Use a real argument. Use logic, use
evidence. But deciding that you know better than me about things I *have*
experienced because you have a higher level character is fallacy.

    No, you dodged it. I responded with KEI and the thread took off on that
for 9 years.

    Perhaps your pet wasn't taking mobs down as quick as this group, she ran

    Well er, post what you do. Educate me if im ignorant. Hell do anything
except tell me how good you are and how ignorant I am. It's really boring to
reply to.

    Tho as a chanter not having KEI is always going to be a reduced penalty.
You might want to consider playing without any clarity at all before flaming
people for preferring to play with KEI.

    Viably as in worth doing. Fear costs 100 mana, dooming darkness costs
120. Most mobs take 2 casts of fear to drop... thats 1.5 minutes of sitting
on your butt medding after ever fight or 20 seconds of it every 3 fights
with KEI.

    KEI is helpful. Person turning up to group with KEI is rendering it a
service, because KEI is helpful.

    Person turning up without when they had the option to bring it, is
rendering it a disservice by comparison.

    I think you're getting the wrong impression really, I'm not the kind of
asshole player who watches what everyones doing then yells at somone for not
casting enough lol. I don't have time to watch what everyone else is doing
usually. But from a philosophical standpoint, if you can do much more for a
group with a buff and you have the option to get it, get it.

        Whole heartedly agree :P If aego or virtue were as as easy to get as
KEI I'd never turn up to a grp without one or the other. They made a HUGE
difference in the 40's anyway.

    Well, if you don't have KEI the case clearly goes to augmentation on
those numbers. I thought that was obvious and wasn't dissagreeing with it.
What I did say is that a caster without KEI complaining about mana and not
applying their best abilities, if they had the option to go and get KEI, is
doing the group a disservice. That's as obvious to me as your numbers are.
Inexperience or no.

    Having said I have to say that it appears you were talking about much
lower level than I thought, and demanding that a caster in their 20's or 30s
get KEI is, in my view ridiculous. Sorry if my misreading caused any
misunderstanding on that.
