Terris Thule:

I was recently given this amulet by an RL friend who is closing his character
down ( deleting) due to vacation and then college starting in the fall.  He was
kind enough to give a few items away and this is what I "rolled" into.  

The question: I run an Ogre warrior so the intelligence bonus means nothing to
me.  I'm big, so perhaps becoming a smaller size may benefit me when I turn
into a skel.  Other than the illusion of being a skeleton, I can't think of any
reason for me to have this thing unless I should develop a character in need of
intelligence.
Should I keep it or sell it?

If there is any benefit for my warrior to have it, then I will keep it
obviously, but if not, I'd rather get what I can out of it, and purchase some
gear he can use.  Now, as for the value of the thing, I have heard everything
from 25K to 60K.  To be frank, if it was 25K I'd just as soon keep it just to
play around with at least for awhile ).

Any feedback especially as to the benefits of having this thing on a warrior
would be greatly appreciated.  I know that when I use it I lose 100 HPs, which
is a disadvantage, but 100 HPs aren't all that much at the moment.

Please share your thoughts with me.

Thanks,
