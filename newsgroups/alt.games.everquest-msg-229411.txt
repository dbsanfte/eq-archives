You're seeing rangers "pre-Kunark".  There are no Kunark-era and beyond
weapons available (nor probably even the good stuff from the old world
even).  That makes rangers rather pathetic warriors with snare, which they
can't even fully take advantage of in that environment either due to no easy
access to bows/arrows.  Hell, they don't even have snare until level 9, and
getting to level 9 as half-a-warrior might prove difficult there.

You're also seeing a wizard that remembers how wizards used to work.  A
skilled PvP wizard is who I'd expect to be at the top of the kill list. 
"Whew, that ranger just about killed me, lucky I had twice his hitpoints."
*boom*  "Bastard wizard."

Necromancers really don't have very good "quick kill" ability, so at lower
levels they aren't all that great at PvP (especially getting reset after
every loss).  Magician has the same benefit of a pet, plus better "quick
kill" ability to finish fights.  That may be the only environment
imagineable that is both PvP and magician-friendly.  :)

No clue on the gnomes.  I'd say mostly just coincidence, though there might
be some advantages to being able to hide behind a tree stump.
