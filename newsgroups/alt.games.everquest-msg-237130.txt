Most seemed to range from around the 63-65 level range id guess. Alot
was blue to us at 65 with a few whites. They didnt seem to have much
in the way of hit points. In fact, without any hard data, id venture a
guess that in both sewers, the level range and hit points of the mobs
were equal (or close), the only difference being the amount they hit
for. In the Plant, if we couldnt get the mobs slowed quickly, someone
was doomed to die - namely me - being the MT. My SK is not elemental
geared ( I do have quite a few of the Miragul's 760 pt armors tho).
Buffed up, my SK has around 6100 hps and 1425 AC - and it was touch
and go in the plant. The Crematory was MUCH MUCH easier and having
adds was no problem.

Mob placement wasnt a real big issue. They were spaced nicely, but
several wander, so that added to the challenge. My chanter (i duo a 65
sk and 65 chanter and the wife duos a 65 shammy and 65 cleric) didnt
have a problem with mezzes for the most part, but occasionally a
pacify would get resisted and draw aggro, and with his "Skin like
bible paper" buff - he would go down fast if this happened.
