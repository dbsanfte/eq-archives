What's wrong with East Commons? There are enough decaying skeletons around
when you need bonechips. I stayed in the FP/Neriak area until I got 12 and
Bind Affinity. Now I just come back to buy spells and ferment things.

Killing those annoying orcs is a good thing- it gets you non-KOS in NFP.
Besides, there's no way to raise orc faction. So you may as well toast their
sorry hides. The wizards, the clerics, and the bards still won't like you
after the knights do, but they are still easily avoided. And yes, you can
raise faction with them, although I'm not sure how with the annoying
wizzies.
