It won't work invisibly from what I remember. But... the guy in Sol Ro wants
a Peridot AND the piece of Tektite.  Just get an evil race person to get you
the tektite, port over to lavastorm, have them turn in the tektite and then
you turn in the peridot and get the scale.  From what I remember, the scale
isn't no-drop either so they could turn in both parts get the scale and give
it to you, but I could be wrong on that.  Either way it's pretty cheap to
find out.  A druid friend and I did this quest by multiquesting this scale,
as I've described.
