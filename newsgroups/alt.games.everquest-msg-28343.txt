I saw one clown camping Pyzjn 24/7 2 weeks straight. I think it he was a
level 28 rogue for whom the GBS could have no value other then to sell or
twink.

During his entire 2 weeks there he continually spammed "No one come near the
ruins, it is my camp!". He had the mistaken belief that killing a single
undead in the ruins would result in Pyzjn popping less often. So for 2 weeks
straight no necros could go there to farm bone chips, no clerics could use
ward undead, no monks could putrid rib bones.

Honestly, he was the lowest level I have ever seen camping Pyzjn. Typically
the people camping her are level 40+. Pyzjn is a level 15 mob.

Understand that not everyone doing the camp is a jerk. I have seen high
level characters who give out bone chips to young necros and putrid rib
bones to monks. Kind of a cool way of camping if you insist on doing it.

It isn't for the nice guys that the rules are made, it is for the useless
fucks like that rogue who take advantage of the situation. Figure how many
paying customers did he piss off in 2 weeks of 24/7 camping a level 15 mob?
Maybe 100-200 newbs? Just isn't worth it.
