Nope.  Special items, such as my cultural armour and the item I got from a
GM event, will be destroyed.  Other stuff that my guild wants, they get.
Lowbie stuff will get dumped hither and yon (too bad you can't put things on
mobs anymore).  Anything else will be sold, proceeds to be given to my
guild.
