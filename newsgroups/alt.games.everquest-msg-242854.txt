fletching is one of the most worthwhile investments, so if you were stuck
making your own arrows, you wouldn't be so bad off (not like you lose money)

there are vendors that sell arrows- they generally sell, iirc, three
types....just get the basic ones, they'll be all you need

in the bazaar, you might be able to get some no-rent arrows...chances are
some mage will be selling them cheaply...dont be buying the fancy ones, they
won't do diddly for ya
