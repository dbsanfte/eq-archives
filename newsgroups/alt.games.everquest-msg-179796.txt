Would you care to illustrate for us "incorrect" uses of Snare? I can 
only think of three, and given your claims, I'm not averse to a little 
sample of your deep EQ knowledge:

If you are going to Dire Charm a mob, you may want it to run at full 
speed. And if you are a higher-level Ranger grouped with a lower-level 
Druid, you may want to hold back Snare so the Druid's longer-lasting 
Ensnare has a chance to land. Also, Snare is a high-aggro spell, so if 
you are a cardboard-clad Ranger, you may want to avoid casting it until 
aggro has been well established.

Any others?

Fair enough. I think the next two paragraphs bear a litte deconstructing, 
though.

..for a rather stiff price; but that's, admittedly, just my opinion.

Except for the fact that it's lacking the almost instant peer review 
process that takes place in this newsgroup, so people have to take your 
word for the "testing", since by the time any incorrect information can 
be challenged, they and their money have already parted company. I can 
see the "SATISFACTION 100% GUARANTEED" jpeg on the site, but it's not a 
link, and I haven't been able to find any information on how to receive 
a refund should I be unsatisfied with the product.

It has already been done. Here is a bit of insider information:
http://groups.google.com
This takes care of the compiling and searching. As for testing, believe 
me, bad information does not go unchallenged here.

Resolving the conflicts of views does not take any effort. You just need 
to pick someone at random and take everything they say at their word. 
Think about it, that's what the authors of these guides are asking us to 
do; the fact that they are willing to take our money does not make their 
points of view correct a priori. Hell, Sony themselves have been known 
to put out bad information.

This newsgroup is open to all, free, and most importantly, updated 
constantly. Don't get me wrong, I know the value of information and I'm 
willing to pay for it (I subscribe to Allakhazam's premium services, for 
example), but I have to question the value of static guides (even if I 
were to accept that they are actually free of innacuracies) compared to 
constantly-updated online resources.

I hope you aren't operating under the notion that lvl 51 is "end game"... 
I'm level 57, and the end game hasn't even begun to rise over the 
horizon yet.
