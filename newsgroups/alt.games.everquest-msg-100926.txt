Welll....  It was humor, yes, but for humor to be funny it has to
contain at least a kernel of truth.

I've had a level 60 warrior ask my cleric (the only healer in the
group) "mana?" to which I replied "30m," only to see him trot off to
pull something.

Needless to say no one in this newsgroup is guilty of this, but there
is a certain kind of player (usually males in their late teens or
early twenties) who finds it difficult to sit still for very long and
will eventually succumb and pull whether you want him to or not.

Lately, in addtion to giving a percentage value for my mana, I've also
taken to saying stuff like "no pulls," "small pull ok," and "ready for
anything."  Seems to help a bit.

High level players are not immune to stupid behavior (and I'm not
speaking only of melees here).  My enchanter friend says 50+ players
still break his mezzes constantly.
