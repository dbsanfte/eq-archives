A couple of weeks ago I started having an occassional problem when I was
playing.  Sometimes when I zoned, and sometimes randomly the program would
crash to desktop and I would get a message that my harddrive was full.  The
last time it happened I was zoning my main character into Emerald Jungle.  I
was not able to relog this character.  When I tried to log her the program
would crash and I would get the same message.  I could load other characters
though.  Finally I was able to log her.

Since the patch with the new EQWindow mode this has happened twice.  I get
the same program shutdown as before, but there is an EQ bar at the bottom of
my desktop.  Clicking on that brings EQ up in windows mode, but everything
is dark as if my gamma were turned down.  As soon as I Alt/Enter to get back
into regular EQ the illumination is corrected and the program seems to work
properly again.  I cannot however use EQWindow mode at all without
everything being dark.

I'm not sure if the shutdown/harddrive problem has anything to do with the
EQWindow problem, but thought I would describe it just in case.  I have a
10G harddrive with 1G available so I don't think that harddrive space is
really the problem.

Any ideas would be appreciated.
