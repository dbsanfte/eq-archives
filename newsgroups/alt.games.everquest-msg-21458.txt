- If the puller runs away without a heal, let him die. Eventually he'll
learn.
- If the puller waits for a heal but you're LOM (and he knows it) and he
immediately pulls, after THIS fight, don't heal him until you have enough
mana for 2 fights (oh, probably 60 mana).

To waylay any objection from Anita L, if you're above 60 mana keep your
tanks healthy.  Not 100% healthy...80% is fine.  Then, if you get below 60
mana, sit your butt down.  In most cases true tanks (warrior, SK, Pally)
don't need you to stand up to cast until they're at 40% health.  I'd start
healing weenie tanks at about 50%.  So you have a lot of time to get back up
to 60% mana.

Of course, if you're above 80% it's a great time to stun or practice melee
until the tanks need healed. :)
