Hes asleep in his tomb, guarded by 4 warders (dragons)

When you kill the warders 1-3, they repop a few days later... upon killing
all 4 simultaniously though, they never pop again, the sleeper is free...
and goes on a rampage throughout Velious.   When the sleeper is woken, SoD's
and the monk robe will never drop again :(

Its a once in a server lifetime event.. there was apparantly a quest to
re-capture the sleeper.. maybe it got put to the side for Luclin work.
