I see a lot of discussion here about whether the moved chars will be naked
or not, but there seems to be no definite answer, that also goes for the
posting by Verant which does not make it clear either way. Does anyone have
a definitive answer to the naked question, or is it all conjecture at the
moment?

As the movelog registration opens tomorrow, and it's limited first come
first serve, it would be nice to get an answer very quickly to prevent
junking my chars. If the movelog is indeed naked, then I for one will not
move as I suspect many other people who have invested a lot of time will
choose to do. I am in the UK, and it would make much more sense to play on a
local server, but that is a secondary concern to my hard earned valuables.
