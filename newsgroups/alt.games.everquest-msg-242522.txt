Bravo! Brav-freaking-o! That was great. I wonder if I can fit all that into 
my enchanter's bio in-game. :P

Too many times I wind up in a group with a multiple pull. I mezz add #1. 
Add #1 is awakened by so-and-so. Fine, they want to off-tank. I get that. 
Not the best use of my talents, but whatever. I mez add #2. Add #2 is 
awakened by the MA who just switched targets for some reason.

Enchanter #1 sits to med, grumbling to himself.
