More than adequately, IMO - my 2 chars got about 8 levels between them
(tradeskill and adv) in those 2 days.

Tradskilling was great - when you make an item for the first time, you

when making a pristine item for the first time.     :)

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes !
They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
