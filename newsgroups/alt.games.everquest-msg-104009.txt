I won't disagree - the graphic engine in EQ isn't nearly what it could
be. And a good portion of the blame should be laid at the feet of bad
programming, IMO.

However, not all of the blame. Bearing in mind that EQ is three years
old, and the engine was probably at least a year old already before
release, we're talking about some ancient stuff in computer time.

I personally think that a lot of the problem now is the result of 3-4
years of fiddling around and spaghetti code, plus being forced to
maintain compatibility with their own out-of-date designs.

Obviously we can't expect Quake-like performance from something like
EQ - the environments are completely different. But I certainly think
it could be a lot better than it is.
