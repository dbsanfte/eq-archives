news:3C209AAC.53AC9E12@stny.rr.com...

A friend pointed out that my underlying problem probably IS with the new
guild cleric.  And she explained why and I decided she was right.

If in a pickup group a cleric looks poor there's a good chance that I won't
care if they do get my 200p share.

The new guild cleric is ROLLING in cash, he has yet to visit our message
board or read our charter.  Damned right I'm pissed, but I was lying to
myself when I said it was two separate issues.

But yeah, I gotta say, if a pickup cleric looks uber I'm going to insist on
my share of the net loot...I need it more than he does. :p
