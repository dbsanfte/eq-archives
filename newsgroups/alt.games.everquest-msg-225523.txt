I'm having a problem with my graphics in EQ.  This is ongoing and has lived
through two graphic cards.

The chest pieces on armor are messed up.  The chest/back of armor on
many/most models are either missing, or are skewed so it looks like the
character--usually elven women--have some weird bird tail sticking out of
their hip.  This is least prevalent on robes, but can still be seen with
them at times.

 - Problem existed on both a Rage AGP Pro and my current Raedon 7000.

 - All old drivers have been erased; all current drivers are up to date.

 - This problem has existed through several versions of DirectX; am now on
most recent one.

 - All armor settings set to TRUE or ON.

 - All .txc files deleted so that EQ would rebuild them.

What else can I be doing here?
