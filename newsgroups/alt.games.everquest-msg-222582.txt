Have done the following :-

PoJ executioner trial
PoNb - hedges
MB
Grummus
Saryrn
HoH trials - villagers / mad norriathians
Solusek Ro
Agnarr the Storm Lord
Vallon Zek
Bert

After killing Bert the other day did the old 'unlock memories' / 'guided
mediation' / 'I will tell you stories' thing - no new AA or charm upgarde
(but this was expected). Ok so today we just killed Rizlona (first time for
me) and Solusek Ro (I had already done previously) - I go to PoK and do the
'unlock memories' / 'I will tell you stories' thing - and unexpectedly I get
AA point / charm upgrade and what looks like to me PoTorment flag - Gram
Says 'Gram listens to your stories of the Plane of Torment - Ravens with
bloody eyes he muses....blah blah'. What I dont understand is why I was
given Torment flag and AA when I have not killed TT yet.

Any ideas?
