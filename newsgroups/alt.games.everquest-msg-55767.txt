In a post on the developers boards on the Sony homepages, VI has already
stated that:
1. This change is mostly for "fun" and is only on Test for now.
2. It may never be implemented anyplace other than test
3. *IF* it is implemented anyplace else, it will only be on PVP servers
for exactly the reason you speculate... "to avoid unintentional
introduction of PVP on non-PVP servers."
