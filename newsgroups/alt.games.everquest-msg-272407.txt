The problem I had with the wholesaler quest to make items was that it 
required me to make items completely outside my area of expertise.  If I 
had been asked to make some number of items in the area I chose to learn 
that would be one thing, but when I was asked to tailor 10 items, it was 
a joke, I had not ever even made one single tailored item up to that 
point.

The other issue is the reward you get for the time you spend is very 
small.  The amount of advancement you can achieve is pretty miniscule, 
but, on the plus side, at least you do get some coin from these quests, 
as opposed to the tradeskill writs talked about below.

Two different subjects here, tradeskill writs are guild advancement 
writs, just like the other writs that require you to kill mobs.
