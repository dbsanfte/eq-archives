Actually, I was just reading a very interesting article about a guy who 
installed a Ford engine in an old Volvo station wagon...  Apparently he 
did a few of them.  Which might explain one I came across in a junkyard 
about 8 years ago.  Pop the hood on a innocent looking Volvo 264, count 9 
leads from the distributor, scratch head in bafflement. :)

Yes, the game may be written in DirectX.  The whole point of a port is 
transferring it to another system.  Yes, that means you may have to use 
some different APIs and make some changes.  This does not make it 
impossible.  It doesn't even make it very hard, assuming a skilled 
development team...
