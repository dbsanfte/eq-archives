    Which means it was doomed to failure. ;-) Vox is much more unforgiving
than Nagafen, and the "standard tactics" employed usually ensure it'll be a
massive killing field. Being an "open raid" just makes it worse, as many
people there feel no pressure to stay and help once things head south.

    This is actually the best part of the raid, as you can usually pick up a
little cash from items like Vox bracers that drop here.

    This is typical. There's a fair number of casters in that area, and at
least some of them are clerics with painfully slow nukes. So every time the
monk goes to Feign, there's at least one caster still casting a spell....
BLAM, up pops the monk to be beaten on some more. It's a tough pull.

    Best method I've seen had players line up along the hall, with ALL
buffers called to the front. The buffers then worked their way down the
hall, like a tank assembly line. The only buffs that get messed up that way
are the ones on the buffers themselves.

    Smart guy. Let me tell you how a USUAL Vox raid fails: casters are told
to bind in the buffing hall, so they can bind-point rush the dragon and stay
in the fight. Raid fails, there's some corpses down in the Pit. Buffing went
long, so giants are repopping and attacking the naked casters who are bound
in the Hall. Casters get in massive bind point death loop. Eventually,
control is established. Rogues die many times getting corpses out,
especially the ones that fell in the Pit and usually must be pulled before a
clothed corpse. As soon as a port-capable player gets his gear and a res,
he'll port out with his buddies - leaving even fewer people to hold off the
giants. Some hours after CR started, it will finish with the remaining folks
punching out to zone, with a few people that logged early getting a
necromancer to fish them out.

    If the raid actually punched out to zone early, with the plan of pulling
as many corpses as possible and summoning the rest out, invariably a few Icy
Terrors will pop along the corpse pull route. The corpse pullers will start
to die, and then people will start to complain and panic over "losing all my
l33t gear" and rush in and start pulling trains all over the place.

    Does any of this sound familiar, Dan? ;-)

    That's what separates raiders from people like me. You CARE what 'toon
you kill. You'll be a good raid person when you get the levels.

    She has to be damaged to summon someone. You could have trained her to
zone, if you were lucky! ;-)

    The only way to stop the CHeal Vox will attempt at low life is to drain
her mana dry before she can attempt it. Enchanters drain mana. There's also
a bug (possibly fixed) that if a caster is hit by Fear while casting, they
can lose the ability to cast spells until they camp out and in. So having
multiples of a needed caster is a very, very good thing.
