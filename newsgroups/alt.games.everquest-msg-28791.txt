Half-way, at least... It logged the various tells, groupsays, and
so on that you received, but not what you told the guild or zone.
Actually, i can't remember if it logged all tell channels, either...

[Rummages about the hard disks]

Yup, it did. But since it didn't log YOUR tells, it wasn't that
useful anyway, as you had to scroll around the main log window
to fill in your own tells...

Time to clean up my hard drives, that file's getting old, and
it's been a while since I used it now...

Now THAT would be useful, but as you say, way too hard to implement,
I'd guess... Scan for "you say Hail, soandso"? Nope, will only get
the start of the conversation. And that can be triggered by PCs
too... Scan for "You say" followed by "Two Names says"? Imagine the
fun that'd be if you're talking to a PC while a couple of NPCs decide
to have a chat? Or if the newbie guards all start spamming "Time
to die A_fire_beetle00!"...

Hmm, thinking about it, the usefulness would be pretty limited...
Wouldn't be too hard to /note the names of the NPCs whose text
you'd want to save, and then later searching those names out in
the raw log...

No shit, 95% of the message log will usually consist of spam from
all channels, even as much as 90% of the group say is of little
or no interest.

BTW: Keep up the good work on the parser!
