yeah I mentioned that poll too, was starting to wonder if anyone else
remembered. As far as the uber guild thing.. it could fail or work
well. I mean, if your WHOLE GUILD guarunteed they'd move it would
work. But if you and some other high level people go thinking it will
be different you might not find enough like minded other high levels
who go to even make raiding TOV possible. I bet a LOT of high levels
who go will take the "get out of jail free" card of returning to their
old server and only being out $29.95 more for one month.

People keep mentioning the divereted thing, but Absor states in a
thread about it that these are totally seperate people and in fact
many new hires just for this purpose.. which is exactly what the
purpose of the $39.95 per month is. I tend to buy what he is saying
since it makes sense. 

I'm not worried at all about our live servers changing but am just
waiting to see if the $39.95 people feel like they will be getting
their money's worth. Ahaha what if only like 100 people show up for
$39.95? That would be 2,995 bucks more than their 10 dollar normal fee
per month going to pay for great CS on this server.. which is like a
person and a half's minimum wage pay more or less which really would
not cut it.
