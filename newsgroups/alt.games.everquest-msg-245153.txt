About a month ago I tried having my BL hit my necromancer's pet in an
attempt to gain 2hb skill ups.  It didn't work.  I tried doing the same
thing with a DC skeleton, but that garnered no skill ups after a 15 minute
trial.  I have decided to just go back to the ye olde fashioned way of
smacking around mobs to gain skill ups.
