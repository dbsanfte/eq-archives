Started up a bard and was buying instruments for him and see that now
instruments have numbers on them, i.e. Percussion Instruments 22.  Was
curious exactly what that number means?  Is it just an overall rating or
does it have some direct application, like FT numbers and such?

Also since I know that a bard is one of the more unique and difficult
characters to play, any suggestions?  I remember a guildie once saying that
at levels x through x, go for dexterity or hp, or ac, or some such thing,
then at certain levels move toward..... anyone happen to know what he was
talking about since this was a year and a half ago and I don't remember
anymore.
