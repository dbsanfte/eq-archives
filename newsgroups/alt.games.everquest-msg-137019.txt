Had a similar problem with an enchanter in DL recently. We got a VERY 
serious overpull (the drachnid camp I believe). Spiders everywhere. Our 
main tank seeing the cleric in trouble switched targets and was trying 
to get the spider off her. THAT started the enchanter bitching. Needless 
to say it was pretty much a TPW. Funny thing is.. even I could figure 
out what the MT was doing and switched targets to assist. Why (instead 
of bitching the ENTIRE fight) couldn't the enchanter figure this out? 
Instead HE gets pissed off and leaves (AFTER getting his res and not 
even saying thank you).
