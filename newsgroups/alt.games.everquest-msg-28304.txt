You may not need any extra network card.  The conventional setup is 2
network cards in the main PC and one network card in the secondary PC.
The main PC has one connection to the DSL modem and one connection to
the other PC.

However, depending on your OS and DSL setup, you may not need the
second network card in the main PC.

If your OS allows you to have more than one IP address assigned to a
given physical interface, you can run two logically separate IP
networks over one ethernet.  You then only need one network card in
each PC and a hub.  Each PC and the DSL modem connects to the hub.
You then run two different IP networks on that ethernet: one that has
the DSL modem and the main PC on it, and one that has the two PCs on
it.

With some DSL providers it is even simpler.  If your DSL provider uses
dynamic IP addresses, check with them and see if they allow you to use
more than one at once.  Some do.  If that is the case, just plug the
DSL modem and both computers into a hub, and configure each of them to
use DHCP to get an address from your DSL provider.
