We finally had someone in our group get a 1492 item - a nifty 61 AC, 100HP,
100 mana breastplate (think those are the stats).  It was a Shammy and we
just hit Miraguls hard until we got it.  During the process, we finally got
to the 63 level average and it made a huge difference, both xp-wise (xp had
really dried up at 62 in an under 63 adventure) and AP wise - mid to upper
40's versus low 30's.   I'm looking to get the Mistmoore robe for two
reasons - stats and it has type 3 aug slot to put a FT2 item in.  This is
what I'm really looking from more than anything from LDoN - flowing thought.
My biggest frustration now - I have enough Miragul's points to get either
one of two FT2 items, but I basically have to get to 1492 Mistmoore points
to get an item to put them on.  Since I'm not in a raiding guild, with 110
mana the Mistmoore robe will be better than anything I can figure to buy or
loot even at level 65.  Once I stick an FT2 and a +6 int aug on it that robe
will be the best piece of gear I've ever put my hands on.  Then my regular
group will hit Tak and I should get enough points to get the DPoC.  I will
say that having a regular group of people who are also committed to LDoN has
probably made a world of difference.  Having to get buffs and hoping to find
a pickup group before those buffs disappear still causes a lot of
frustration when I'm trying to get a few extra points outside of my regular
group.  It would be great if, along the way, we finally upgraded our
equipment enough to take on hard adventures.
