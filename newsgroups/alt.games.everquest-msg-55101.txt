Hmmm, I hadn't heard that one.  I had heard that a single group either
killed Naggy or got very close to doing so.  I'm pretty sure that a
single group of 60s with Velious quest armor and equally decent
weapons could do so.  I have heard (and seen screenshots) of a bard
charming Innoruuk (or was it Cazic) and using him to clear quite a few
mobs.  The very next patch they put the level limit on bard charm
songs.  Bastards!
