Have a problem - lost my body in 'The Hole' or as the map showed, Ruins of
Paineel.  Was walking along the path in Paineel and fell in.

Am level 45 ranger, and zone is 40-60 according to EQ Atlas.  Also a problem
is that you can't get out without a teleport or fighting your way through
the zone and finding a key to get out.

Rambling, question is do necros, or anyone, have a way to get dead bodies
out of a dead end zone trap like that?

If not, where is this graveyard I will have to visit in a week for me
stuff...?
