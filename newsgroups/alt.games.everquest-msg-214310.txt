Follow Up;

I want to thank each of you for your suggestions.  There were several that
suggested find a Necro, crawl through the crack in the rocks, get in and
summon.  Well, thats the approach we took and it worked perfectly. Thank
goodness the Necro new where the rocks and the crack were. It did take a bit
of trying to get in this way but we finally made it.

Thanks all for your help.
