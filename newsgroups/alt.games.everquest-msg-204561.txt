Well, after nearly 2 years and 75 days played 
Mairelon the Magician is now offically - 

Arch Convoker Mairelon Snapbang of Lanys T'vyl

http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=701866
(add a 1 flag charm to that, can't do it with magelo yet)


Now, I have my AA's mapped out for quite a while to come,
but I do need some advice on what to look for to upgrade
my gear.

Obviously the Hoop of Magi'Kot needs to be replaced with
an Earring of the Solstice, but not until I've found the
spell Black Steel (which will take all my savings) because
that one spell will dramatically increase my damage efficiency
and my ability to hit fire resistant mobs.

Also, my group has been taking the Spirit of Taekwo Icequake
and Spirit of Radir fairly frequently, so I anticipate replacing
the Golden Chitin bracer with the 12ac/15int/6 to all saves
bracer they drop (so far we've gotten the wis/sta/cha/str variants)

The group I'm often in that goes after drops is -
65 ranger, 50+ aa (EQ, AM3) (both epics)
65 cleric, 12  aa (SCM2) (epic)
65 Druid,  40+ aa (epic)
65 Monk,   (bunches of AA)
65 Mage,   (almost no aa yet)
64 Warrior, Epic'd and 40+ aa

These folks are in NToV level gear, with the exception of me.

I'd like to go after the drops, and the mobs need to drop things
everyone could use (or sell).  I have the good fortune to have
looted a lot of the stuff I'm wearing, and like the feeling of
accomplishment that gives.

So, what kind of mobs drop stuff we'd be interested in going
after that might lead to upgrades for me?

Particularly the neck, hands, pants and cloak.

Also, can this group do Velketor the Sorceror?  I know Martin
'bot armied him, so I'm hoping we can - a pair of Boots of Blade
Calling make me drool :)

Thanks in advance :)
