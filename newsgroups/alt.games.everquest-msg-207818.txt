Im very leeery of SWG - looks good having seen it on a friends machine,
lots of good ideas - but wandering round in high grade Imp gear in a rebel
area with no reaction just seems limited to me. Space should add to the
game a lot. I just feel it may turn out oo much to be a test for EQ2
mechanics and not enough Star Wars.....Ive seen a greater than 50% drop
rate from the game amongst my friends so far. So I'll probably skip it
unless it upgrades heavily

Yeah and SWG isnt covered by the SOE alll access option so far as I
know....if it is well I may go for it - SWG, Planetside and EQ would be a
very atttractive package.....without all three Im unlikely to get even a
second one on the list....
