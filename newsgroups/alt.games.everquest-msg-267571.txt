Well I saw App III spells being sold at the broker last night for an
over-priced 7s, so I only upgrading zap and multi-zap. Hopefully
someone will be selling an App III summon soon.

As for Adept I stuff, someone was indeed selling an Adept I summon...
for well over 1g!

Hopefully, prices will normalize a little when more people start
tradeskilling. I've met a lot of people in the game that want to
tradeskill, but are too confused and don't know what to do.
