A woman falls into a coma from asphyxiation, no explanation. Her
"husband" and her have been having trouble in the past. They were
working it out. No charges were filed for assault, because there was
no evidence of a crime. Some claim there was motive and opportunity.

An court gives her a monetary award. Instead on spending it that way,
as he stated publicly, he decided that she "would not want to live
this way" despite the fact that she was a devout Catholic, and that
there was no living will stating that she wanted to die under any
circumstance. In Catholicism, euthanasia is an extreme mortal sin, one
that carried a penalty of automatic excommunication.

Her "husband" has no dental care for her, no medical care except
warehousing her. Only a deathwatch. How would you like having cavities
untreated for years?

When he pulled the respirator she failed to die on cue. He now
proposes to starve her to death. He has said it isn't the money, but
he refuses to divorce her, and has two children by a woman he lives
with, while his wife stays in her coma. Her parent have said they
would assume all costs and take over, just go away.

Yes our courts have sentenced Terri Schivo to death, and the Governor
can't order a reprieve. She has no articulated wish to be killed in
this fashion. Many in Florida want to revoke the starvation clause,
making it murder to "withhold nutrition".

She only has her "husband" as a guardian who has a clear conflict of
interest.

How dare Jeb step in.
