PBAOE has a huge advantage in that it's not limited in number of targets.

>Icestrike is 3 AOE waves of 46ish damage for 17 mana. 

Rain spells can hit at most 3 targets (maybe 4, memory is fuzzy), and
usually don't even hit that many.  Targetted AOE can hit up to 4.  Lucy says
Icestrike is Targetted AE, Direct Damage, so I'm surprised it does 3 waves...

>FoF is 28ish PBAOE damage.  And it costs something like 47 mana.

PBAOE can hit as many mobs as you can pack into range.  We used to routinely
AE hundreds of mobs at a time in Fungus Grove back in the day.   Enchanter
PBAOE stun to lock them down, wizard and druid PBAOE to kill them.

>Is there some advantage to the higher cost spells that I'm missing?

Yes, but it'll probably never matter.  They'll sit in back of your
spellbook, never seeing use at all, except for the higher-level ones when
you're killing hundreds of greenies for tradeskill drops.
