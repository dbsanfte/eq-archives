}No.  There is a *flowing thought* cap of 15.  This is items with "Effect:
}Flowing thought IV"
}Items with other effects that translates to mana recovery (eg lunar whispers

}AA abilities also do not count to this cap.

They changed the effect on the 8th shawl... It now has

effect: FT III
focus effect: blessing something or other with no mana regen.

I've also heard a rumor that mental clarity regen counts toward he FT cap.
