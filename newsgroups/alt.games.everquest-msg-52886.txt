I was wondering how many original dragons there were in Norrath?

I know of Vox and Nafagen, but was thinking that there were four original
ones....

Vox & Naggy at the start.  Then Gorenaire and Ol' Wassisface in Skyfire when
Kunark came out a year later (4/00).  The 2 new ones were put in so that
folks OVER level 55 had dragons to kill.

Now with Velious I have no idea how many honest-to-goodness dragons there
are.  *I* know of 2 more but I'm not in a raid guild.  I'm guessing there
are at least a few others.
