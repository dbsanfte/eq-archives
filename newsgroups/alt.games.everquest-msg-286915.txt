One of the reward items that can show up in random LON booster packs is 
a Visage; there are various ones, but all seem to do the same thing; 
they give you an illusion form which has a 15 point DS on it.

When I first saw this, I asked people about it and was told it stacked 
with everything, so the next day I reached into my wallet and bought 
myself 5 boosters.  As luck would have it, I got a visage and a potion 
reward.  Cool.

Put the visage up, and yes, its a 15 point DS.  BUT, this being after 
the second patch, it no longer stacks with everything after all, now it 
takes the same slot as Potion DS, or my Coldain Ring DS.

I normally don't use potions, so this is still a 7 point improvement 
over my coldain DS.  But its a far cry from the 15 pointer which stacks 
with everything that made me go out and spend some RL cash.... 
particularly because when I -really- want DS, I'm going to swig a potion 
after all.

Further ( and I knew this going in) as its an illusion, it blocks me 
from casting my Pact of Hate, which is a Lich type spelll I use when I 
don't have  Tranquilty available (its about KEI level), so the principle 
time I'd be using it, soloing or in weird gimp groups, I'l have to 
choose between more DS and more mana flow.

Although its clicky from inventory, and all class all race, you can't 
use it in shroud form either (shroud to level 5 and a 15 point DS is 
sweet.. although you can get the same effect by drinking Skinspikes II 
potions)
