LOL and *everyone* reads the agreement, right? I have never actually sat
and read one of those on any piece of software I've owned. I wonder if
there has been a study done as to actually how many *have* read them. An
even better study would be how many have read them and actually
comprehended them. Getting to your statement I'm sure you're right that
they don't actually guarantee you will be able to play anytime you want.
I've even noticed on the newer MMOG boxes the disclaimer stating they can
change the game at any time without your consent. It's a sad world when
companies have to actually *tell* people what they *should* realize to
begin with. Sort of like the warning on a box of steak knives telling you
the contents are sharp.
