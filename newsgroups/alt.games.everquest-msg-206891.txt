 You sure we're not in the sme guild? Heh. Air is one of the worst for
unintended aggro for us. I try clearing as little as possible and
telling people to stick to one side or the other. I gave up on that
though and now pull everything since poeple can't listen very well when
it comes to moving.

 Named we pull out of the temple areas but Avatars we go to. Are Avatars
leashed? I think we tried pulling out and they seemed to just sit in the
doorway above. Taunting us. Bastards.
