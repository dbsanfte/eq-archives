Verant has always said that it's from character selection screen on.  That
doesn't include server or chat.  Whether or not that is TRUE, I don't know.

BTW, yeah it's 24 hours or 7 days, but keep in mind that if you're online 12
hours it doesn't mean that you have 6.5 days OFFLINE left...you more than
likely only have 3.5 days offline left.  Figuring it out can be damned
confusing.  Needless to say, if you've died make sure you get your corpse
the next time you're online. :P
