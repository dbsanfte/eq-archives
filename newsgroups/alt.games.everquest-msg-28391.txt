Sell it.

I have a set of Darkforge Gauntlets for sale, because I was bumming
around CT with my Paladin and managed to find the components,
when there weren't any Shadow Knights in the zone to loot them.

With the current rules, I can loot them, and a Shadowknight can
end up with some nice DF Gauntlets he wouldn't otherwise have,
while I can end up with a bit of cash for my trouble.  Everybody
wins.

With the Warrens/Luclin style loot rules, we'd all have lost out
as the Decayed armor pieces poofed.

Honestly now, how many Shadow Knights would actually have their
Darkforge armor if it weren't for higher-level people having
an incentive to gather it and put it on the market?  How many
Shadow Knights would actually camp in CT at a level when the
place is quite deadly to them, and camp it for weeks on end
until they finally got all their armor, after countless deaths?

Some people want to quest their own armor, no matter how
difficult (I quested all my Armor of Ro, from levels 30-33).
Others would rather buy it and spend their time pursuing other
goals in the game.  The current system accommodates both
sorts of players.

Uh huh...

While there are some abusers of the system, for the most part
I've seen "loot whores" add a lot more to the "ecology" and
economy of the game than they've taken away.  I would call
the process "rape".
