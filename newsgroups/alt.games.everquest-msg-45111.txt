	Another possibility that happens with my warrior is a somewhat
dangerous macro.  My warrior has a macro that goes like this:

/sit off
/attack on
/doability <bash>
/loc
/doability <taunt>

I start almost every combat with it instead of the autoattack key.
Occasionally I press the macro to attack, but the mob dies before the
"/sit off" is processed because of a big nuke (like a guard's melee on
a goblin whelp).  I wind up in attack mode but with no target.  If I
were to target a merchant without turning off atttack mode first, I'd
be attacking him.  The fact that you were attacking to help (so
couldn't be hidden from the guards) but were ignored by the guards and
merchants until you right clicked on one, seems to indicate that you
were in attack mode when you clicked.
