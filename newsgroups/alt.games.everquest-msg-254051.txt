Yeah, but we have such an anti-corporation mentality in this country 
(US) that if any politician ever mentioned removing their taxation 
there'd be an uprising. The average Joe just simply either doesn't 
understand or doesn't want to understand basic economics and how taxing 
corporations, while sounding good on the nightly news, does NOT help 
them in any way. Moreover, I'd wager that most people don't even realize 
how much tax and crap corporations have to put up with just to do 
business. A rather high percentage of people I talk to don't realize or 
are not aware that corporations have to match the taxes that are taken 
out of their check and that that match, in effect, could be additional 
salary paid to them.
