my understanding is that you cannot sell on Ebay, anything in game in EQ.
Their policy is that they don't want people selling chars/plat/items for
real money to others, and if you are caught you risk getting banned.

I remember reading one story where someone did share  their password, and
lost items and plat.   but had no recourse because the guide told him if he
persisted he would lose his char too because saying your char has been
hacked means you did something against Verant policy like share your
password.  maybe I'm getting UO confused with EQ.
