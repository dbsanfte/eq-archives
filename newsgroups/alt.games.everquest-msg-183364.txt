I have to say that so far I'm impressed with the LoY Live Event.

Gukta didn't crash under the weight of the traffic.
Innothule didn't crash.
Stonebrunt didn't crash.
The dyes seem to be working well.

The only bug I'm aware of that's been introduced is the stacking issue in
the bazaar, and that's pretty minor, really.

Given the way Luclin and PoP went, I wasn't expecting to see stability until
later on in the week.  Now, the server I spend most of my time on (CT) puked
last night and they had to do a rollback, but that seems to have been an
isolated incident ... haven't heard of any other servers bombing.

Could this be the beginning of the end of store-bought expansions?  Or a
fluke of nature ....

Crash
