I wanted to try out the Eye of Zomm changes, so went into Befallen.  I
sat near the entrance, and sent my Eye in.  On one of the trips, I saw
a bunch of NPCs gather around another NPC, and she made spell casting
gestures (I didn't have spell effects on, so am not certain she was
casting).  The other NPCs then fell over dead.  Furthermore, my
familiar poofed!  I took no damage, and received no message indicating
that I had resisted any spell.
