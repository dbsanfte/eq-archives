It does change your size, at least outside. It made my wood elf druid
as tall as barbarians/trolls/ogres when cast on me. 

1) I think you have to be grouped

2) If you are casting it on someone in the water, as you say below,
you have to be under the water partially if they are for it to cast on
them (or any spell)

It at least works in great divide for sure, someone with me cast it on
me at the ring the other day.

I think its useless, just a novelty. Shrinking is nice to get around
more easily if your bounding collision box around your character is
rather wide or tall (such as on a barbarian, vah shir, troll, ogre.)
Growth has no such purpose. I'm pretty sure in any case where you were
stuck growth would just stick you more.

It may follow the same zone rules as shrink. Try casting it in
butcherblock if you are around there. I know shrink works there.
