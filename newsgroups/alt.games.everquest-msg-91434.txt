LOL.  I have yet to see more than 2 of any combination of guide and
gm on at any time and 90% I never see even one.  I think your
operating costs are a bit high too.  Just going by the electric bill
of the company I work for that has lots of machines running all day
every day.  I am sure they pull way more power than a PC server.
All that aside there are 4K people per server )likely more and not
counting guides or gm's.  All of those pay $9 an month no matter how
they pay. so we have 36K per normal server and 42 servers.  So we
have 1,512,000 a month to cover operating cost (which are very
minimal for a mostly automated system).  They can very easily afford
to have the best set-up to run this game.

BUT (and this is a very big but) the object is NOT to give you the
best it is to give you the least you will accept for the cost you
are charged.  By doing that it all means more PROFIT.  It has, and
never will be about us it is always about the numbers  (had one of
the top management people say that to a guy that was fighting a
written warning where I work).

To illustrate this a bit better.  I work for a company that bottles
spices.  At present we run bottles of spice on a 60/40 basis.  By
that I mean when the bottles run across the scale 40% are under
weight.  That is soon to change to 50/50 and may end up 40/60 before
we are done.  By doing that we 1)meet government guide lines and
2)provide the customer with the least product for the money they are
willing to spend.  That in turn increases the profit for the company
which is what companies are in business for to begin with.
