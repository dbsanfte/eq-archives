    Oh don't get me wrong i probably overstated the boring the fuck out of
me part. If I'm pulling almost any group is fun but yeah I'm a bit over the
reserve spare tank dmg adder person role, and am a bit frustrated with
people's attitude that the tank-and-heal group is the only way to play the
game. Not really in here but ingame - if I /ooc LFG I get tells...
plural..... if I /ooc looking for partner and I get one curious question
back, I pounce on that guy because he's the only one who'll /tell me all
night.

    And that's just duoing. God forbid anyone suggest a different strategy
for group play or that a group sans a cleric can achieve anything.

    Fear kiting? We don't want to chase our mobs thanks and don't you get
adds?

    We dont have a cleric we're doomed.

    Get the melee casters suck!

    And other great shit. I once got told by a cleric not to taunt mobs or
cast on them. We had a pally in the group 2 levels higher than me and he was
the "MT". He wasn't holding agro for shit and the group's wizzie was
constantly getting beat on. I said ok and resorted to only taunting or using
a taunt spell to get mobs off the wizzy but the cleric got up me for that
too. I asked why he was so particular about it and his reasoning wasnt that
the pally tanked better (never got mentioned, never came up) but that "I
shouldn't have to heal two tanks" and that was it.

    As to the wizzy he said "He can learn how to control his agro". I argued
that the wizzy could nuke earlier and a lot more when I was using my spells
to raise agro away from the level his nukes would generate, and yep, you
guessed it, very deaf cleric ears. I left them to it. These days I have
loads of fun agro-kiting or fear-kiting with our guild's 53 wizzie. I feel
practically honoured when the mob continues to come at ME after an ice comet
hits :)

    The average group mentality seems to as phase-locked as your druid or
necro insisting they're a solo class. I mean, in God's name just pair those
two up. Stupendously powerful dots + root? <squirty noise>

    If all the top end content can *only* be reached and enjoyed via
default_strategy_tank_heal and the amazingly slow agro building powers of
warriors, then I'm not interested in it. I guess I'll get to the point where
our guild can try some ideas and get wiped a lot and quit or go think up
something more fun to do. If it really is that monotonous then it sounds
like the designers never really got past the lord nagafen concept, which is
dissapointing to say the least.

    But if it is possible to take these things down any other way, I'm
confident that sooner or later I'll find it :)
