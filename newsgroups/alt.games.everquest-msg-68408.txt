Agreed.

EQ had some problems with these cards back in the winter of 2000 when they
tried to play with the sound engine, took them months to iron it all out for
us SB Livers. And, if memory serves, it took Creative writing a new driver
update for those cards as well.


Either the folks at Creative aren't writing drivers that are easy for
developers to code for, or the sound guys over at Verant aren't quite as
sharp as they should be. I have a feeling that it's more the latter than the
former.
