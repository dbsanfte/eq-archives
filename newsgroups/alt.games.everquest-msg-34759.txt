As a Network Administrator I will let you in on a secret Everything you do
on a company network can be monitored and recorded. Its sad to say but part
of my job is monitoring network traffic, looking through emails sent and
recived also this includes personal accounts people have with aol,
earthlink, Yahoo, Hotmail whatever if it goes across the company internet I
can monitor it. I also have the ability to either remotely take control of
your computer or watch what you are doing without you knowing it. Consider
the Risk.
