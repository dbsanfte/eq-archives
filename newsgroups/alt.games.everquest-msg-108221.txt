	Tracking players is borked.

	You are supposed to get more frequent position updates for whatever you
are tracking.  This works (or seems to) for mobs.  It does not work for
players.  In fact, you get ZERO updates on players most of the time; you will
track them to the spot they were at when you entered the zone.

	You used to be able to track players in your group -- group members were
also supposed to have their positions updated more frequently, tracking or no
-- but that doesn't seem to be the case any more.  The last time I tried to
track a group member I was sent in pursuit of an untamed aquatic avian.
