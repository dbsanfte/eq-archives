I have had my computer built to what I wanted for EQ.  512 MMX Ram 1.4 GHz
AMD procesor GeForce 4 64 MMX video card Legacy Auido...not sure on what
else to put down here.....Oh Windows XP home version, Cable modem

Well my problem is this I play Everquest and then it crashes to windows or
will cause my computer to reboot...well the company that built my computer
made me upgrade my video card from a GeForece 2 64MB to the GeForce 4 and
said that would fix the problem well it has not...I am still having the same
problem so anyone out there think they might have the answer please let me
know....Other then that I have to take this piece of crap and let them strip
it...and If I do that they are building me something BIGGER AND BETTER...but
I would hate to have to wait for 3 weeks for it

Eric
