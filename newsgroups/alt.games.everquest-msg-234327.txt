Hi There

Yes your correct in the mass colour changer option is how you change the 
colours in already completed maps

the menu that comes up on selecting that option lists all the line & 
label colours in the map (This can include black and white if they are 
used in the map

Each colour has it's RGB 'hue' value displayed with the colour. (Dark 
colours may be difficult to see)

Click on the colour in the list you wish to change.

The 'Hue' values now appear in the selection boxes to the side of the 
menu.

You can now either

1) edit the selection boxes by entering the colour you want as it's 
'Hue' values
(Useful if you want to cut the number of colours. Just enter the values 
listed in the colour you want to merge with that is already in the list)

2) Press 'Colour Picker' This brings up the standard Windows colour 
selection chart. Pick the colour you want and it's 'Hue' values are 
placed in the selection boxes.

Which every route you take. Once the 'Hue' values are the ones you want. 
Press 'Execute'

The selected colour will now change to the new values. (If merging 
colours. Shut the Menu and then reopen it. The menu will now show one 
less colour in list as the 2 colours now all the same value)


>You can turn the texture off and make the map background any color you want.

Hehe!

Thanks!. It explains a lot about the rather pale coloured maps I have 
found. They make sense now if people are using a dark coloured 
background.

I should have looked deeper :)
