Confession time. As posted in an earlier thread, I recently had occasion
to be camping guard Valon at the tollbooth in WC for North FP faction.
During that time, I saw a monk come in screaming for help with a griffon
on his ass. (I can relate. Happened to me a lot in lowbie days.) He FD'd
by the guard who fought valiently, but went down. By then the Griffon
was low, and the monk got up and attacked, but was still overwhelmed.
  At this point, I realized he was doing the same "guard pull" I've seen
done with giants in WK, but it didn't work. But this guy *knew* I was
sitting there camping Guard Valon, since he'd asked earlier.
  He FD'd and I got up, ran down, and finished off the bird. (I'm at the
stage where I can *sometimes* solo a Grif with no healer, but it's a
damn close fight, so I don't try it and have just as good of a chance of
dying.) Needless to say, I didn't get the majority of the damage, so I
guess the monk got the xp. No biggie.
  Later that day he did the same thing again. This time, the guard died
again, but the monk's later attempt at FD resulted in "skeevy_monk_01
has fallen to the ground". Ooops.  I stood there and watched him die.
Then I strolled up and polished off the grif in about fifteen seconds.
(It ran in about a few hits, being so low). I felt a bit guilty, but it
was some of the easiest xp I've ever gotten, and it dropped a peridot to
boot.
  I dont' know if that trick is a "sploit" or not, but you can't always
count on higher levels cleaning up your mess for you when you try to
take shortcuts. I'm not a guard, boys.
