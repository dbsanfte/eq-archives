Risk v Reward..  3 hours+ clearing Flurry mobs (who drop nothing of use to
us), to then fight the named mob, who *might* drop some loot, but then again
he might not!  And even if he does, it might be that worthless axe!

What a freakin tease from verant, we port in and see all warders/sleeper
alive, we about shit ourselves.. we zone out with the Motg and Proggy dead,
deciding the whole zone is now a complete waste of time
