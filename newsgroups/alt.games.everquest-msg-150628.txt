Lord Cheese apparently plays on a Zek server that uses the Team PvP rules.
The teams on a Zek server are the Human Team ( Humes, Erudites, Vah Shir,
and Barbs ), Elf Team ( high elf, wood elf, and half elf ), Peck Team (
Gnomes, haflings, and dwarves ), and Dark Team ( Trolls, Dark Elves, Ogres,
and Iksar )

 Four teamers are, usually, Evil team guilds that have gotten tired of
getting thier asses handed to them by large 3 Team guilds, and have decided
that since the 3 Teamers arent going to follow strict rules about the teams,
then neither are they. 3 Team guilds are, usually, combination
Peck/Human/Elf guilds. A good example of this type of guild on Vallon Zek is
Defiant. As a matter of fact, Defiant is the main reason that 4 team guilds
sprouted up in the first place on Vallon Zek. Somthing had to be done to
combat Defiants out and out ownership of all the really desireable high end
areas in the game.

Anyways, hopefully this answers your initial question.

Oh, and take what I say with a grain of salt if you want, as my main,
Breearr, is a member of Dark Defiant Warriors, a 4 team dark guild.
