Never fear, you can both upsize and downsize blocks of clay by
combining them with water flasks in the pottery wheel.

large block + water --> medium block
medium block + water --> small block
3 small blocks + water --> medium block
3 medium blocks + water --> large block

Note that medium blocks are labeled simply "Block of Clay". 
I'm pretty sure the muddites drop them too.
