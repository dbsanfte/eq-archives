It is. Though most bards focus on dex/cha gear they usually have enough
dex to max it with focus.

Especially in LDoN it is useless once the bard is 63+. As PoVeeshan is
standard lineup for day to day adventuring ;) bards seldom suffer from
lack of resists.

Bah. I love to melee. If you put me in a corner and order me to play my
drum and/or lute I'm getting bored. :D
But you have a point. Click of haste too. You got epic. And even if not,
your march of ... provides better haste than the shaman buff.
