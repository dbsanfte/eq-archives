These systems get blurred as you describe when any character can pick
from any skill, and any combinations, with the only limitation
possibly being the total number of skills.

The way I intend to limit thing is to have incompatible skills. It'd
disallow a warrior from being a mage as well, though may allow him to
have very minor magic abilities. As for the less drastic differences,
I intend the same with the different schools of magic. You can master
one skillset for one school, but not all at once. Disallowing the mage
who masters *ALL* of em, as it is so famous in Asheron's Call for
instance. But again, still allowing the player to make use of other
abilities, just to a greatly reduced extent. 

This way leaves the choice of skills entirely up to the player, allows
for a great extend of customization and uniqueness, however, does not
allow the master-of-it-all type character, and still draws a line
between "classes".
