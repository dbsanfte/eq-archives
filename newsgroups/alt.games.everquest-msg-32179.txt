    True, seeing a floating necro would discourage someone from using it. I
was talking in general, though - do you hear about poison being used much,
or as little as on a blue server? My rogue used some Paralyze II in a camp
recently on a mob - 33% slowdown, 95% snare. Shocked the hell out of the
group - "A rogue can do THAT?!?"

    Max. backstab possible, with discipline, is about the same damage as an
Ice Comet. Add in the chance of double backstab, and letting a rogue behind
you is just death. If you didn't have such a bad computer/connection,
though, you might be able to fight them. IF you know a rogue is coming (and
that's the rub in all PvP, isn't it?) there's a few things you can do:

1) Get your back against a wall, and stay put. Backstab is a rogue's biggest
weapon. Without it, he's pretty much a ranger with hide/sneak.
2) Get up Banshee Aura. As a cleric that has to heal rogues that go up
against Banshee Aura'ed mobs, I can tell you that he'll be killing himself
VERY quickly on this. If he stops attacking to try and dispel you, you get a
chance to either re-cast the spell as he dispels (requires timing), or just
get in a good DoT/Tap. If you have access to a damage shield potion from a
shaman, you'll roll the rogue.
3) Have a chanellable Tap/Leach-line spell available. As long as you don't
die, he will from the damage shield and Gobantik. And once he turns to run
(which he will), he's doomed.

    Question: do pets on /guard here turn to face invisible opponents too,
like a rogue with hide/sneak up?
