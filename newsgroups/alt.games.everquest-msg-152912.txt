SNIP

I was in Jaggedpine forest near the poachers when I saw a level 60 monk
killing poachers. He was going through them like mince meat, leaving the
corspes everywhere. I asked him if I could shoot an arrow at each, so that I
would get a faction hit for each kill. He said ok, so I stuck around while
he was killing.
He would clean out a tent then move on. All the corpses he left though (I
figured he just wanted faction, and didn't want the added weigth of the
cash). After a few minutes I started looting the bods as well, since he was
showing no intention of looting. He did not tell me not to loot, did not
complain when I did. I assumed it was like me in Black Barrow killing gnolls
for faction but leaving the corspes.
I made around 150pp in about 30 minutes and a seriuos leap in faction with
the good guys.
Didnt last long, I think he was trying to trigger a spawn by clearing out
the camp. When the spawn didnt pop after a while he cleared out.
