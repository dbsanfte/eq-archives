  Last Rose Of Summer
  Find this song on Sheet music, CD

  North to south the time in less days of all girl
  To know the shadow begin to grow much grow
  As sunset spy is deep and lonely
  I give you this' last rose of summer
  Talking of my only love
  So that with this wiggle man will tears the earth
  All around seems dark and cold
  These both remind you of the time
  You know was wrong oh my lady
  Don't despair all the nature seem be in rest
  In sleep she's well
  Till what day not so very far from now
  To the opening the first rose but I shall return
  Last rose of summer
  Side Two=20

  I don't have a clue what this means. It's a beautiful song though.=20
