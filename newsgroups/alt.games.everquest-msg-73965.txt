Unfortunately, horse implementation is such that instead of "cool" most
players see someone with a horse as "fool"

Horses =could= have been cool... but they are not.  As implemented,
you'd have to be an idiot to buy one for use... so the only reason to
do so would be to look cool, which would have worked if it wasn't for
the fact that instead of looking cool you look like an idiot who thought
horses were good ideas.  Even if you -new- they were not for use, noone
looking at you on one could tell thats what you were thinking.

Tizmak armor, now, that was cool.  Stats unimpressive, but it sure
looked good on my female high elf cleric, she kept a set in the bank
for special occaisions.  I understand "looks cool" as motivation.  It
just seems to have backfired here.
