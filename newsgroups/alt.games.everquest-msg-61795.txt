Thanks for the response, it's hard to find good information. So players
can build cities and the game automates defenses and factions within them?
That's really interesting, although the generation of `dens of villainy'
are almost guaranteed :)

Hm, this is sort of like what DaOC tried to do. In most examples i've seen,
however, the game designers end up adding `good' drops to make the levelling
treadmill a bit more rewarding. It sounds like a good concept, but it still
means that a PK death is a positive gain for the killer and a loss for the
victim, even if the loss is limited and recoverable. As such not a game
mechanic that serves to limit ganking.

Getting only a small amount of experience still acts as a positive towards
killing everything you meet. Now a negative experience reward for killing
something much weaker than you is a different thing entirely.

That does sound really interesting. And as such the ill-equipped but
dangerous bandits soloing out in the wilderness form a logical part of the
big picture. Even leading to the natural generation of `war' that DaOC
tried to artificially construct. That could be good fun, but balancing
the game mechanics to generate the desired outcome is going to be very
tricky.

Hm, I think they should probably be worried that it is the PK community
who are their most ardent supporters. It would be heart breaking to build
the world and find that the sort of society the players want is something
out of a mad max movie.

I agree it sounds interesting, novel and a challenge to build right. They've
also got to make it so that the ongoing dynamic of the game is rewarding
enough to keep the `builders' on line but does not become `stable' enough
that their is nothing further to acheive.

Though I differ from you, i'll watch for a couple of months after they
release it and then make my decision. While cutting edge is fun there's
also something to be said for stability and maturity in a game world. And
in this case the `personality' of the servers is going to be of vital
importance in picking your new home.

Anyway, thanks heaps for filling in the missing pieces.
