Just curious what the best way to improve a combat skill is besides
spending training points.  My main combat skill has always been
piercing, but I would really like to use a 2HB as well eventually.
I've been fighting blues constantly with my 2HB weapon, but hardly
ever see an improvement, just lots of 'swing and miss' messages, lol.
My 2HB is 35 now and seems to be stuck.  I played 2 hours last night
and didn't see a single point raised.  Is there a better way or a
trick I'm missing.  At this rate, I'm not sure it's worth it.  Thanks
for any advice.
