Interruptable yes.  But as my cleric is a long time TBoots user, I know
the way around that: click TBoots a lot.  Click before every pull.  Click
before zoning.  Click mid combat if you've been jumped but have things
under control at the moment.

JBoots are definately better than TBoots.  But since bards can reportedly
click TBoots without having to stop moving, they aren't as much bettter
for bards as they are for other classes

JBoots/TBoots are as fast as 9th level shaman SOW.  Sure there are mobs
faster than that. For them, the happy bard has Selos, while you SOW casters
have... my cleric on your friends list, I suppose.
