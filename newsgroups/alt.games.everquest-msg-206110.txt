I would like to have my UI autoannounce friends and Guild the way I
can have a channel auto a members arrival or departure... there issms
to be provisions to this but having to /announce [channel:PW]
everytime I login seems course.

can I toggle any of there in the ini file or somewhere else, or is
this just a broken 'feature' that works in Diablo2 and not EQ?

Is there a way to auto join more than 1 channel? is seems like Guild
is nothing more than a labeled channel and my guilds officer channel
is mandatory reading for laughs but that is not the only channel I
want to 'subscribe' to at logon.

Thank you for your time if you have read this.
