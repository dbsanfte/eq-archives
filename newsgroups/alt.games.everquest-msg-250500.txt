	Sense heading for all characters now begins at 200 and the
compass is viewable at any time.  Those guides were written either
when there was no compass for a player or when the compass wasn't
accurate 100% of the time until sense heading skill reached 200.  When
the game first started dwarves had a racial advantage of having a
sense heading skill of 50; other races started with zero skill. Hence,
there was a need to skill up sense heading or learn to use the /loc
numbers to know which direction you were moving.  I think the dwarves
should have a racial skil of 50 in alcohol tolerance now that every
race is born with inate direction sense but I don't run the game.  

Other changes in the game are:
	You can see your actual skill scores now. Originally, you just
could only see a rating such as "aweful" "poor" "average" "good" etc.
To know the actual numbers, you had to run a log parser since every
time you gained a point in a skill the number was shown.  Sort of
silly to show the number when you gained the point but not later, but
that's the way it was.

	You can remove an item from a container that is in the bank.
When I started, you had to take the container out the bank and put it
in your inventory before you could open that container to take
something out. There was no shared bank slot; to transfer items or
cash, you had to get a friend to hold it or had to drop it on the
ground, then log in an alt to pick it up. Yes -- cash was droppable.
One often came accross "monk droppings" (i.e. copper and silver and
even gold coins that monks considered too heavy to carry) in dungeons.
