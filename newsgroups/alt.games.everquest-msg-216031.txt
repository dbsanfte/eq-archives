Oddly, I have to admit the reverse is true for me, I usually use CR, its a
much better format and tends to be reasonably accurate, plus there's a
discussion on each spell which often points out different uses for the spells
and so forth.  Lucy may be more accurate, but I'm not used to it, so its
difficult to figure out just what its talking about, plus it lists spells
that don't exist and doesn't clearly delineate which spells are what level,
and there's no real discussion forum (technically there is one but since its
pretty much unused, its not a resource.)

When I'm looking up spells, I usually want to know what spells are available
for my level, a basic rundown of what they do, and hopefully some pointers as
to where they can be found.  CR does an admirable job of that 99% of the
time, faster and easier than Lucy plus Allakhazam
