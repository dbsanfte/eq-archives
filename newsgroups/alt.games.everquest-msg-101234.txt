Giggle.

When I play my necro, I roleplay Perky.

As in, while hunting gargoyle eyes, I did a lot of talk in guildchat about
gleefully slaughtering my enemy and carving out their eyes to take home as
souveniers, but all this seawater was doing just terrible things to my hair,
and should I wear the Robe of the Oracle which clashed with my skin, or
should I stick with the shadowbound robe with lousier stats- but I just look
sooo deliciously evil... Oh and, does anyone want these wood elf parts? I've
got stacks!

I debated Fluffybunny. Sunshine. Joy. Mostlyharmless. But my guildies
pleaded with me that these were too Evil for Evil to use. So I asked one of
my guildmates who speaks many more languages than I do for translations of
Sunshine. He assured me that Solskin was the Dane equivalent. And I liked
it.

Tarre of course was chosen because it fits under the usual method of name
creation for me: Tiru, Tirra, Tirre, Tarre, Tirr, Tirea, Tirna, Tir, etc.
