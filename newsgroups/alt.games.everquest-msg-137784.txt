It only took about 10minutes for me to do mine, and I love it,
my old system was concieved when my mage was 10ish, and was 
breaking down.

I've already made my hotkeys and spells in one horizontal row
at the bottom - I just like them out of the way.  I haven't
thought of anything truly nifty I'd like to do yet.  2 boxing
makes it pretty easy to work with though - simply share the EQ
directory, edit/save and move to the 2nd box and /loadskin.

I haven't even bothered to open this one, and my main
is a mage - however the ability to see other party members'
pet's health and select them with F# F# is a HUGE boon to
grouping pet classes, as is the new functionality of 
/pet report health.
