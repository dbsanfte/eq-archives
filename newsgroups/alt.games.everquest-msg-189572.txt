Ok once again its not the spell thats over-powered ITS THE MOBS !
Same spells on Luclin mobs and the results are far different from PoP
simply because the mobs are different. Nerfing the spell is flat wrong
but they will anyway since its too late to fix pop.

This is all the result of mudflation, the mobs have to become so
overpowered because the items have become overpowered. This was all
done so Sony could sell more copies of PooP. You are right about where
the blame lays, square on SoE for sure.
