Since the implementation of the name change services, even seniors
can't change first names. They can still nerf surnames, though. My
last check on the guide program, there was at least 1 GM online each
server for a shift 5 days a week. Since GMs can do offline
namechanges, the GM just needs to get the report, he doesn't need to
actually catch the player online.
