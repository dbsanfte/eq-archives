I did CT recently which requires clearing everything, so the golems dropped
along the way.  The iksar broodling spawns right where the golem dies, and
can spawn off of all three golems (we got 2).

As far as force needed...   you should start by telling us what kind of
force you have available.  First thing, two of the three golems deathtouch. 
They'll deathtouch when they're first pulled (have a suicide puller and a
backup puller standing right behind him to tag and bring to camp).  They
will then deathtouch again once every 30 seconds or so, so expect your MT to
drop not far into the fight and be ready for it.  They hit for ~400, have a
minor AE that wasn't enough of an annoyance for me to even notice it really,
but that's coming from a fairly well-equipped level 65 viewpoint, probably
100 to 300 point AE, cold resist if the graphic was any indication.

If you can do Vindi or Trakanon, you can handle the golems.  If you can't,
you *might* be able to handle the golems.  They're easier than Vindi and
Trak, but not by a whole lot (and at my level, Vindi actually becomes
easier, because it doesn't matter how good your equipment is, a deathtouch
is the end).
