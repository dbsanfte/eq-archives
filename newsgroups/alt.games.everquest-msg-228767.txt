you will have easier time leveling up with int around 134 like a gnome or
dark elf has of max int.
put the rest into stamina...
hps are very important at later levels... moreso than mana eventually, as
you are limited by time and nukemana cost and aggro to how much you can use
in a limited time period...
after 7 or 8k mana you realize you can't use it all on a single
monster...maybe quarm or something

truthfully though, stats don't matter except for lower levels, as AA's and
PoP items are there to give you many stats.
and with all the mudflation of items, you won't have trouble with anything
really ...
a long time ago, 5 stamina for me did matter when I was fighting certain
monsters, at like level 8 or something.
