I've heard this rollback idea before and think it would be a lot harder to
implement than some people think.
My opinion is the game has moved on and expanded and it's just not feasible
or practical to move backward.  I certainly don't want SOE programmers
having to divide time between essentially two different games.  Maybe
someone could form an "Old World" guild on a server - players committed to
using the old zones and equipment.
