Tried all the tricks that was suggested here in this thread last night, none
seemed to work at all. I did manage to advance my swimming skills up a few
points!  Got a hold of gm and he did come to abysmal sea, said that they
knew of it and  were working on it and it would be fixed but had no time
line on when. He did find me a one time "private" boat ride to abysmal sea
though, heh!
