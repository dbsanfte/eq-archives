Daoc is the game EQ should have evolved into.  eliminating the boredom
of camping something for days on end so you can get an item to drop.
the limited zoning.  The minimizing of down time.   running your
character within a "kingdom" that seems to hold together.  encounters
set up in ways to reflect the "world".  

better graphics ( i havent seen Luclin),  realistic base computer
requirements ie 128 megs, decent video card and processor and your
fine.  

Powerlevelers did run into a problem as the mid-high level dunguens
were not all itemized before launch, apparently mythic thought they
had some time before people would get over 30.   

In one word, EQ seems more like just Hack 1999, DAOC seems to be a
step on the road to creating a role playing world.  underneath its
still just hack 2001 but its a step forward.

Its kind of amusing to see all the major failures of EQ, be quoted as
reasons to stay with EQ.  

i did also like the post that said play at the lower levels in EQ can
be just like play at the higher level.  which of course it can.  its
just that everyone is so encouraged in EQ to powerlevel inorder to
play a certain way at the top levels that this is usually overlooked.

i enjoyed playing my Ogre shammie in EQ, but it seemed like there
wasnt a freedome to roam, but a certain progression of zones/camps and
groups that i should follow inorder to level the right way.  and if i
wanted to wander the world and see what comes EQ just didnt encourage
that kind of playing.
