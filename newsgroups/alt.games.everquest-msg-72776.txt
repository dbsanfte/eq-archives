Just looked at the prices and such at the site above and i wish I had
known of them earlier.  I ordered from OEMPCworld.com which has a
similar memory calculator to determine what you need and although the
price was a bit less the shipping is more and is taking longer to get
here even though it is being shipped express.

Thanks for the tip.  Will likely use them when I add my additional 512
as the money becomes available.
