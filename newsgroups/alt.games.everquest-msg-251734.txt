You think so? It's easily doable at level 17 or so. In the olden days,
when the pass was permacamped, it was pretty trivial to peek in on Dylin
on the trips between the orcs and the bank. Nowadays, it seems like he's
almost always up, there are so few camping him. And you'd be hard pressed
to find another +10 wis item you could get on your own. The Mana Pres 1
is pretty much a wash, given the ease of getting the PoK mana pres 2 ring...
