So last night we tried to take out the Ireblind Imp in Fear and got
owned many times over.  Single group makeup was:

70 cleric
70 warrior
70 rogue x2
68 rogue
70 shaman

The AE mez killed us, almost literally.  Now we're not idiots we just
have never been in Fear, so I'm looking for some suggestions on taking
this dude out.

We had just finished killing Praklion in Dagnor's for the Berserker
Epic 1.0 and the Ireblind was next on the list.

Normally we do not have 3 rogues, so I'm interested in suggestions for
group makeup as well.  Our usual group is:

70 warrior
70 cleric
70 shaman
70 rogue
65 necro or 65 monk

We were down one guildie and so added 2 rogues.  Thought the DPS would
make it trivial but that was a big mistake.  We can swap out the rogue
for a 70 chanter if that is preferable.

Thanks.
