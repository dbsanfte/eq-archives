Deep in the "what is a berserker" thread, we've started wondering aloud 
how intimidate works.  I thought I'd bring the discussion out here in 
the open since its likely half the people reading the NG have that 
thread on ignore.

So, what does anyone know about Intimidate?

What I have so far is that it can be reasonably reliable up around 150+, 
but that this may depend on having other combat skills also up high. 
One source says that Kick skill is checked, and that this is the reason 
monks can intimidate well with a 150 skill in it, while bard cannot even 
with the same skill; because bards don't get the kick skill.  Someone 
else, though, says that rogues can intimidate well despite not having a 
kick skill either.

The principle reason I think there might be more to this than 
superstition is that I have been punching the intimidate button nearly 
constantly for 13 levels as a berserk, yesterday I turned on the filter 
to allow me to see misses, and at one point I saw a failed kick 
message... even though I didn't have a Kick hotkey set up (kick is on 
the same timer as Frenzy, which does more damage, so I substituted 
Frenzy at level 6)

Anyone more knowledgable, or heck, just more opinions?
