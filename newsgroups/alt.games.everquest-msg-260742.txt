   I guess I have to really update the FAQ now.

   New high level zones, I assume?  Someone please comment on this, since I
want to include it in the FAQ.

   Ok, are these doable at all levels?  And how exactly does a "task"
differ from a "quest"?  Are these the new single player instanced zones? 
If these are engaging and lowbie friendly, I can see these as being the
"draw" for non-ubar fold to purchase OoW.

   Lenny was playing some of the new MP3's for me this morning.  Some
sounded cute enough the first time around, but I can see griefer tactics of
a halfing sending his or her battle cry to a helpless victim over and over
again.  We'll have to see how this pans out.

From the sounds of this, I would doubt that players can send their own
voice macros to other players.  Good.  Cause it would be really creepy to
be hunting skellies and get the audible tell "I want to sniff your
panties".

Easy, huh?  I wonder how many AA's one must earn to unlock this.

Again, useful, but how much grinding of AA's?

> Improved Customization for Graphics

  For everyone, or just OoW owners?

   I think this has been a long time itch of the graphic artists.  I
remember a poll long ago (I think) where they asked us if we wanted shadows
over, say fixing broken quests (my memory is fuzzy on this matter).

  So this is for everyone but shadows aren't?

   I can't see this doing anything but slowing things up.

    Goosebumps on woodelves doing corpse runs to Vox's Lair?

  Gasp!  *thud*  *time passes*  This, and all that follow, sound to me
like  general changes, not just for those with OOW.  And if so... why after
I _just_ deleted EQ from my computer?  Really, this one thing was the deal
breaker for me from even thinking of ever firing EQ up again.  I hated just
hated _having_ to farm to get the cash to cast my most popular and demanded
spell.  And yes, while some groupmembers did give dots over for this, most
did not.

    I wonder if many clerics will still make demands for larger portions of
the take, or all gem drops.

   Great!  Now mages need some love too.

    I wonder how many bards will not read this whole patch message, and not
understand why they aren't raking in the exp anymore.  I expect there to be
some gnashing of teeth over this one.

    Overall, some of these things sound pretty interesting to me, and I
look forward to hearing reports back.  But I dunno if I think the new
content is worth the price of a new expansion.
