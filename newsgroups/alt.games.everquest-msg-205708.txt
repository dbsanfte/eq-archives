Hi all,

Just a quick question about these two spells? What do they stack with?
I heard that it overwrites KEI, which would be pretty silly, but I
can't get confirmation of that. Just wondering if it's worth the pp to
try to get it. I'm already using PoTC, the Blessed Coldain Prayer
Shawl, and an Earring of the Solstice. Then with KEI at times, I'm
doing pretty good with mana regen, but always looking to make it
better.

Do these spells stack with all of those spells/items?

Thanks!
