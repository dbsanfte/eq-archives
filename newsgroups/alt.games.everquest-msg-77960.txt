Have fun, let me know if you find any problems.

Major changes below.

Joe D

Now tracks your guild membership via the "You have joined/You are no
  longer a memger of" messages.

Catching sandals, daggers, and fish scales now reflected correctly in 
  the "Misc" report when the new-style fishing message is received.

Tracks merchant location within the zone, as long as you /loc 10 seconds
  prior to talking to the merchant.  By talking, I mean get a price,
  not Hail Soandso.

Added "Time in Zone" to the "Zones" and "Zones by Level" reports.

Fixed "Other Damage Taken" report.  It works now.
Mob count on "Other Damage Output" report now correct.
Misses now reported correctly on "Other Damage" reports.

(A note of explanation here.  The new "Other Damage" reports are what I was
working on prior to the last release when my wife woke me up at 5am one
morning.  My daughter was born 10 hours later.  When I got back to the
program a couple of months later, I'd forgotten where I was...)

Added a new "Merchants/NPCs" tab, and moved the various merchant reports
  under it.
If there are more than 500 items, split the "Merchant Inventory" report
  into 27 different reports, divided by the first letter of the item
  name, plus an extra for the non-alpha names.  Makes it easier to find
  stuff.

Added a 6 month date threshold on the player and guild reports.  If they
  haven't been seen in 6 months, they don't get listed.

Now recognizes "Taunting attacker, Master." in addition to "Taunting 
  Attacker Master." as pet taunt.

Fixed bogus strike-but-miss messages you get when zoning.  Was ignoring
  -ALL- strike-but-miss messages, now just ignores the bogus ones.

Fixed problem with Ranger bow crits.  When the mob hit was too far away
  for the damage message to be seen, crits were not being recorded
  correctly.

Reports that you've marked as not to be saved via the "Save All" option
  are no longer saved - bug introduced last version.

Skills now saved in EQLog.INI file in [Charname-Skills] section, allowing
  reported skill levels to be preserved across data file format changes
  if you haven't been saving your logs.  Section is updated automatically
  with new skill levels.

If your level isn't known, the various level reports are no longer
  produced.

Fixed a problem with the DPS column not being produced if the character
  name is not known before the first damage is done.
