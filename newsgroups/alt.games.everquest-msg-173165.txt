Extreme future shortage...    580,000 barrels of oil are planned to be
taken from Alaska.

It is said that if the SUVs (sports and utility vehicles) were to have
the normal fuel/milage restrictions on them that a normal van has then
about 250,000 barrels a day would be saved.

Interesting.  Half of the Alaskan oilfield is to be used for SUVs.  Is
it only me which thinks that something is wrong here?
