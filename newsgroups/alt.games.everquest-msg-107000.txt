Never met Biano. The last time I tried teaming up with a necro he ran
off to do his usual fear kite with pet thing and basically seemed to
just want me around for sow and chloro and occasional heals. No fun
for the druid who didn't like being kept on a leash and not informed
about what necro was doing out there while she medded up after buffing
him, so she quit trying pretty soon.
