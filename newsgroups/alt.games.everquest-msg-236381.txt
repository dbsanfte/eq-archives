Some of which are incredibly more helpful than the default.  Some custom 
UIs I've seen even implement in-game maps.  They're static, but they're 
better than having to alt-tab back to the desktop and look at online maps.

And yes, I know you can play in windowed mode.  In-game maps are still a 
nice custom touch.

Depending on class and level, of course.  Some classes (tanks, 
healers) find finding groups 
very easy.  Others (Stealthers, hybrids), not so much.

Crafting = tedious as hell.  In my mind, the only thing SWG did right was 
crafting.  Additionally, many of the items available in the latest 
expansion put player-crafted ones to shame, so there's not as much demand 
for them anymore.  The chief advantage player-crafted stuff gives you now 
is the ability to custom-make a complete set of gear to your exact specs.

But unless you're *really* willing to sit in front of your box for days on 
end hitting a button every couple of minutes hoping for a skill increase, 
don't worry about it.  However, one of the biggest moneymakers in the game 
is salvaging particular gear for raw materials, turning those raw 
materials into trinkets, and selling the trinkets back to the merchants.  
You need a crafter to do that, but you don't need a maxxed-out crafter.

Gold's too readily available, and things are a bit inflationary.  The 
biggest money sinks are high-level, perfect-quality player-crafted gear, 
and player housing, which was pretty much implemented primarily as a money 
sink.

Ditto.

Biggest problem is that the in-game CSRs can't really do shit for you.  
That's not their fault.  It's Mythic's fault, for not giving them the 
tools they need to give good customer service.  The latest expansion, 
Trials of Atlantis, was barely playtested for balance or bugs, and a lot 
of people put many hours into quests which they were unable to get credit 
for.  Most the CSRs could do was explain that they couldn't give you quest 
credit, even if you provided them with all the logs in the world, and pass 
on a bug report to their superiors.

In other words, the in-game support is pretty poor.  You might find 
yourself waiting hours, or even days, to be contacted by a CSR who can't 
do a thing to fix your problem.
