Never had instant death in befallen, but then again I'm not so stupid as to
jump down the well.

And I couldn't con the dorf because the 11 SK and his pet were between me
and him and i was dead before i could target or right click.

and I was bandaging before I saw the dorf coming anyways, there was sort of
a blur of a guy running past me, an NPC saying his "You have ruined your own
lands, you won't ruin mine" line about 9 times, a pet suiciding from a dead
master and "Loading... Please Wait"

And once again, I wasn't defending the 11 SK in any way shape or form, I
agree she was stupid to be there, I simply mention that I was not the only
one to die from this.
