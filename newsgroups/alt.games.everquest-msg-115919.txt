Who says it was just one member? I've run into the same thing, My highly
honorable and respected guild where I was an officer Disintegrated. I had
heard of another guild with a good rep that a few acquaintances were in. I
let them know I was interested, and I accompanied them on a couple of raids.
The entire guild was crude, immature, and doodish. Not the guild for me...
after the raid, I just faded away, still looking for a "good" guild.
