Sorry, you obviously have some form of mental handicap. I try not to make
fun of the mentally retarded.

What was there about you having me confused with another poster named
Richard that you didn't understand?

I have made no posts in this or any other thread berating people for
petitioning names.

Only attempted berating going on is by Lokari and yourself. Your efforts are
so bad it doesn't really count as berating. I'm having trouble thinking you
serious vs feigning lunacy.

As far as getting the last word in, go ahead. I'm under no obligation to
correct every error you make. I give people credit for being able to spot
your mistakes. Your post if they are serious lack any content that make them
worth reading. Your post if they are meant to be humorous are just plain
pathetic.
