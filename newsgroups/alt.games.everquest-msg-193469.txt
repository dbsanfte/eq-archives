Aye :) Seem to run out of mana without KEI :) They are all red to me
but I find they don't resist all that much. KEI at this stage seems
like a good investment, 10pp for three hours of KEI, i've been getting
3-4 hill giants and assorted griffons, griffennes ect ....

Although the HG's can be killed without it, just need to drag them
past the guards who will take them down to 1/2 at least ... though I
don't like doing that as there's nothing worse than running for them
with something nasty on your tail only to find them not there.

Cheers,
