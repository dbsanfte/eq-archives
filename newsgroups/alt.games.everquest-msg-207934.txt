Thanks for a very informative post.
I think I can get him to 20/25 by the porcupine method, starting at
his noob zone (still undecided as to the race yet) then at 4/5 head to
Unrest, then at 15/16 to PC.  Hopefully that will take him to mid
20's.

Once he gets to his early 40's I can group with him in a zone that's
green to me but in his exp range (CC / Runnyeye?).  I've been there
recently with Tzen and tore them up (they were empty at the time).

I'll probably take your advice (Lance) on the middle section - head to
GC or DL and get the cleric in a group and use Tzen to buff and heal
(as well as the cleric).  That's the sad thing about ranger heals -
what we get at 57 clerics get at 24.

Thanks to all who replied.  Once I get started I'll post here as to
how I get on.

Cheers,

Tzen
