The level subject has been explained.

Rezzes
29 (49 paladin) Revive - no exp
39  Resuscitate - 50% exp
49 (59 paladin) Resurrection - 90% exp
56 (Epic clicky) Reviviscence - 96% exp

Equipment,

Forest loops for ears, ~250pp each or hunt them off giants in kunark.( 3 wis
ea.)

Savant's cap for head, cheap or hunt up in Unrest (3 wis)

Black Alloy Medallion for neck, get a group to Runnyeye for one, (5 wis and
6 AC)

Silver or Platinum or Velium Ruby veil from a PC jeweler (4, 7 or 8 str/wis
on face) about 100 for silver, 300  for platinum and 600 for velium are
average on my server.

Rings are good unless you have an assload of cash to upgrade to velium.

Wrists are good unless you're up to the extra ac and str on runed mithril
bracers.

Ulthork for arms, 3 wis, about 100pp or hunt for them yourself in a few
levels ( I got mine at 32) on the north shore of Eastern Wastes.

Gloves are good unless you can afford Coldain Skin (or could wear Gnome
Skin, though it's not a significant upgrade from split paw)  Coldain skin
run about 3k on my server.

Shoulders, either gain a few levels (get to 29, new spells) and kill Thistle
Underbrush in Lesser faydark for Braided Ivy Cords (5 wis) or do part of the
Screaming Mace quest in crushbone for Prayer Cloth of Tunare (3 wis), or get
a bunch (11 or so) of your level 30ish friends out to Hollowshade moor and
tear apart the sonic wolf cave to get to Ghowlik and get an Elder wolf hide
(10 ac 4str 4wis 4int 30hp all/all 5 wt), very superb item, I'm wearing one
over my Ivy Cords (ac/hp are GODLY in dungeons compared to 1 piddly wis on
BICs)

Chest, either get a Cured Tizmak Surcoat, or Ulthork BP, better ac on
either, 7 sv magic on tizmak, fairly useful, but 3 wis 35 mana (negative
35hp though) on ulthork, I'm wearing Ulthork because of the wis/mana... and
the fact I kinda permaloaned my cured tizmak to a guildie monk who lost his
fungi...  =/

Back, umm. not a lot o' options here, Cloak of the Ice Bear, nice saves and
ac/hp, not too expensive (50pp or so on my server), Cloak of the Ry'Gorr
Oracles, 2 wis and some mana, and nice saves, I think I paid 200 for mine.
Or get a group together and go to Permafrost and kill the goblins for a
Mammoth Hide cloak (and while youre at it, why not get mammoth hide legs off
the same goblin?)

Legs, the aforementioned mammoth hide, or Gatorscale... not really much help
from me here, I went from my self tailored tattered legs to Tizmak Legs
(which Halflings can't wear) at level 6, then upgraded right from those to
Kromriff Military leggings, but you don't stand the proverbial snowballs
chance in hell of getting Krommrifs unless you have a few high levels to
help you with the giant (like I did  =P)

Boots, once again, not much help here from me, I wore Filth Covered Boots
from the warrens from about level 14 to 34, then I got Cultural Tailored
boots (and occasionally bought cheap Eboots/coldain skin, but nearly
immediately sold them again for mass profit, the cultural were fallback),
now I'm wearing Coldain skin and keeping them.

Weapon, uhh... GET A MAGIC WEAPON.  I used an obsidian scimitar for a while,
then a velium etched stone mace (3str 3wis), now I've got either a Dark
Ember (5 wis 2 str and some other stuff, procs a 14pt DD at 35) or a
Journeyman's stick (4 str 4wis 4int procs Tashani at 35), haven't decided
which I prefer yet.  Probably Dark Ember.
At any rate, at least get something like a plain old Velium
Scimitar/Mace/Morning star.

Testament is fine, although I use a Charred Guardian Shield for the 10 ac
instead of 1 wis 10 mana more on the book.

Range slot get a Small wisdom deity, 2 wis and about 100pp on my server.

Ultimately, remember that I play in dungeons a lot, so tend to sacrifice a
little wis/mana for AC/hp/saves.

My stuff is viewable at http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=39316

Note, the pixie earring and belt were from the Halloween GM events, so you
can't get them anymore.  Also, I personally wear the Bracer of the Hidden
because I do a lot of escorting people around invis, and it saves a LOT of
mana to not have to cast see invis on everyone, it also keeps me prepared
for dispelling mobs. (once again, dungeon crawling risks)
Also, I wear the headband over my GM event 4ac 4wis 4mana 4sv disease helm
for one reason... stupidass GM event helm looks like a fucking bicycle
helmet on my poor wood elf, headband has no graphic...   I'll probably
switch back again though for the AC/saves on GM event helm.
And lastly, I keep fishing grubs in my ammo slot for one reason... corpse
holder, so my corpse doesn't disappear if I loot all my equipment, and I
might be able to get a rez a bit later.  (had a corpse at zone in in lower
guk, left grubs on it, went to Cazic for a bit, and about 6 hours after the
death (rez timer expired =(  ), somebody sent me a tell asking if I needed a
rez.)

Now, on to Specialization....
At 30 you have to put a point into Specialization for all your 5 casting
skills or you don't get specialization for that skill, then you have to cast
spells of that type to raise spec.  First spec skill (NOT the actual casting
skill) to go over 50 is your primary specialization, and the only one that
can go over 50.  Every casting skill CAN get a successful specialization
check, but they're only really major on your primary specialization.

For me, since I tend to group a lot, I went with Alteration, for better mana
efficiency on heals and other group oriented spells.
For soloers, if you primarily root/rot (as I do when forced to solo), you
should pick Conjuration for better mana efficiency on your dot spells.
For Quad/single kiters, you should pick evocation for better mana efficiency
on you DD spells (especially if you're a hardcore quadder; I personally hate
quad kiting though.)

Hope this helps!
