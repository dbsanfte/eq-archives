In the state of Oregon at least, you can't just arbitrarily
bar people from a lot of businesses.  Case in point - Fred Meyer
(a northwest chain of grocery/variety stores) tried to ban
petition gatherers(*) from their entry ways a few years back.  The
petition gatherers took them to court and won.  The  ruling
was based on the fact that Fred Meyer was a public meeting place
and therefore they could not ban the gatherers from the premises.

OTOH - My office is in Pioneer Courthouse Square, known as
Portland's living room.  It's under the jurisdiction of the
Portland Parks and Recreation Department and without question
qualifies as a public place -- yet you can't set up any
"structures" (these include things as simple as tripods), nor
can you loiter in our lobby -- both of those things will have
you kicked off the square by a parks officer.

So, yes, a business that caters to the public is distinctly
different than a private home (at least in Oregon) but public
place or not, if you violate the rules they can toss you out
in a heartbeat - even something as seemingly trivial as loitering
in our lobby.

(*) BTW - I find paid petition gatherers to be incredibly distasteful.

If you can't get enough volunteers to gather your signatures, you
shouldn't even be on the bloody ballot.  But that's another story.
