I'd have a hard time coming up with 5 camps where I consider an
enchanter necessary for an exp group these days. ... and in all of
those I'd prefer a bard over the chanter for pulling and crowd control
since they can actually take a few hits on a resist or mez break. 

It's kind of a vicious circle for a pick-up group enchanter. Charm is
usually out for a pickup group, they just don't work well enough
together. The few spots I can think off where I'd really want CC, I'm
not about to chance it with an enchanter that I don't know and trust. 

Rgds, Frank
