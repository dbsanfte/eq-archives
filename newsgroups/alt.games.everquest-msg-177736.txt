Since I know a nunmber of extremely competent game coders, and the sys
admins who keep their game servers operational (for another company) -
when I look at the relative complexity of what is being dealt with in
terms of machines, world persistence, number of accesses and rate of
information flow and the amount of hassles they have with their servers
despite the level of testing I see (and have participated in) it never
ceases to amaze me how well SOny do in general on this point. I also am
aware that that attitude sit outside the general opinion.
