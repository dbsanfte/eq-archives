Ask around when you are grouping for people who have played the game a while
and are levelling alts.  They might just enjoy showing a newbie their
favorite dungeon.  I had been in a few dungeons and I felt the same way.  I
never went very far because the idea of a corpse run and sheer numbers of
MOBs was pretty overwhelming.  Finally in my upper 20's I met someone who
took me and a few other people to SolA for my first real dungeon crawl.  It
was a blast and I've been hooked ever since.
