    You're being hosed somewhere. The plat alone should be about that big on
a 65 adventure, in my experience. That's not counting the cash items (fire
opal gem table and planar gems table), the LDoN-specific cash items, and the
research items, some of which sell in the Bazaar for over 1 K each.

    I've found the XP rate to be about the same, one AA per two adventures.
About the same as adventuring in Cazic Thule, really. I have access to
places where you can get an AA every 50 minutes, and I prefer LDoN because
of the fantastic loot.

    He got two augments. Him, personally. It varies, but I find you average
about two augments per adventure. Each one at level 65 is +6 to a stat, +6
to a resist, or +8 to MANA/HPs, and they go in any slot. Depending on what
level of play you're at, that can be a small perk, or a big deal (the
INT/WIS/STA enhancements in particular).

    At level 65, it's 51 points for a Normal adventure. To put it in
perspective, I've seen an 11/19 1HB with 25 STA and 35 HPs available for 340
points. That would be one hell of an offhander for Joe Blow the Warrior,
especially once he gets some more points and slaps a Ykesha proc on it.

    If you go to Takish, where you can mez almost all the mobs btw, you can
find an Improved Damage IV belt off the minis on normal difficulty. You'll
also get a lot of crummy Reagent Conservation III necks, but the one belt
will make it worth your while, especially considering what poo most INT
caster belts are.

    You need to track down the minibosses. They can be identified on
tracking by the name - all capitalized words, like Flowmaster General versus
a common Flowmaster captain. On normal difficulty at 65, we found items like
an AC 40 + 60 HP / 40 MANA (and stats) chain tunic, an AC 27 STR/DEX/STA 9
(plus other stats) chain leggings, an AC 7 DEX/AGI 10 PR 15 Vengeance II
ranged slot item, etc. Good stuff for the level, with a few exceptions due
to itemization anomalies in EQ (Tae Ew Chain Tunic, for example). People
doing the hard difficulty level 65 adventures have got 15/21 Backstab mod
daggers, 75 HP/90 MANA Haste of Solusek masks, and other goodies, all
droppable. The only issue with these items is they have recommended level 60
on them, so sticking them on low-level alts is out of the question. But my
56 rogue is delighted with her new pants, new ranged slot item, and new AC
12 45 HP + melee stats neck. Well, the pants aren't toally great - they have
bright magenta as their undyed colour. Guess that's incentive to buy LoY!

    Then gather STA items, or resists, or top up that AGI which you avoid on
general items. Think long-term: this is +108 in resists spread across you,
if you decide to just go for resist augments. That's 20 to all resists - not
bad for a "free" upgrade.

    The Safehouse has a nice stickied thread, in either General, Back Alley,
or Quests, that lists all the items people have seen on vendors and what
they cost. That should give you a very good idea as to what to aim for.

    Honestly, I think the best part of the vendor scheme is the augments.
All the other stuff will eventually be mudflated into uselessness (or
already is kinda crummy), but being able to slap an extra 125 DD 0 second
stun Ykesha proc on a weapon will never be useless to Joe Warrior. I'm not
saying some of the stuff isn't good now - I've seen robes that were nearly
100 HP/MANA which could accept augments like Regen V (for necromancers) or
Flowing Thought III. But over time, a 100 HP/MANA robe may not be as rare as
it is now, whereas being able to augment an existing uberrobe with more
stats will be useful.

    Oh, one more perk. That Adventurer's Stone you got? It sticks to your
charm. For every 10 adventures you complete in a given theme, it gives 2
HP/MANA, to a maximum of 100 HP/MANA. So if you had 20 Guk, 10 Tak, 15
Mistmoore, and 15 Rujark, it would be +10 HP/MANA. A nice addition,
especially seeing as how you can get another Adventurer's Stone at any time
if you change charms.
