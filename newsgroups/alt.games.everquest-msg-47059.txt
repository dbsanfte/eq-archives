I just want to point out that there is a driver update for SB Live on the 
Windows Update site for XP. I didn't have any problems with the default 
driver, so I don't know if it will help you. I will say that on my system 
at least, the sound in EQ was pretty crappy with both drivers. It was 
pretty much the same as Win2K in that regard.
