  Right, this pretty much sums up my opinion of Verant on the whole, right
now.  They are making some really promising, progressive changes and
additions that I like in the arena of quests, dungeons, and gameplay in
general... but their quality control still leaves A LOT to be desired.  The
other area in which I am usually pretty critical of Verant is CS... which
isn't helped at all by having bad QC... bugs fill up the petition que with
upset customers.  If the game featured half as many bugs and broken quests,
I bet we'd see a measurable improvement in Verant CS, aside from the obvious
benefit of having a less buggy game.

  On Firiona Vie, the Ghoulbane is still tradable, but I don't see very many
people selling it... I've seen a few people buying it though, which leads me
to believe it's carrying a pretty high price tag.  I didn't really intend on
doing the quest, because I figured that with TLC in effect, it'd b too much
trouble to complete the quest which I'd heard was bugged anyway... but I
really wasn't relishing a shin lord camp, and I didn't want to have to pay
10k for it when I hit level 50 so I could complete my epic (which is
probably an unfounded fear, but I'm glad to have gotten it out of the way).
