Sorry for the OT question here... Here's the deal: My girlfriend's
parents' HD died in their Hewlett Packard computer, so they bought a
whole new computer (Don't ask, I haven't figured it out either) and
gave her the old one to do with as she pleases. We wanted to
cannibalize the DVD-ROM drive and the CD writer, but can't figure out
how to get them out of the tower. One side is an almost solid piece of
metal even after the outer casing is removed, so there's no way to
access the screws on that side. One theory we had was that there was
some way to remove the front of the casing and take the whole "bay"
holding the drives out that way, but so far no luck on finding a way
to remove the front face. Anyone have any clue how to get the drives
out of these bloody POS computers?
