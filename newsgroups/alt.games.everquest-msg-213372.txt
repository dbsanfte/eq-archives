This isn't from "chat" tho.  It does behave like the "chat" triggered

autorun (including the "new" feature of _not_ turning off unless you
reverse direction or toggle autorun normally).  I had a couple close
calls soloing my lowbie Ranger until I realized what was happening
and started tapping my back-up key everytime I stop when I run more
than a few steps (same thing happens backing up, need to tap forward
key to ensure I stop after backing a ways).
