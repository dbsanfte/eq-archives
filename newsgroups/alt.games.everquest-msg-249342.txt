Oddly enough, yes. It would have been. It would have demonstrated at 
least a sliver of detachment from the act of killing the person. It would 
shown at least a sliver of civility (if any civility could possibly exist 
in the deliberate act of causing someone's death). It would show enough 
regard for human life to desire to be no closer than necessary to the 
actual act.

Honestly? The american journalist who was also executed in the same 
manner, gunshot to the head, didn't create this much hatred in me. I 
still see a big difference.

Your inability to see the difference between shooting a person to death 
and what these monsters did just amazes me.

I *guarantee* you that those were atypical soldiers except for the last 
couple who would appear to be poor examples if you're trying to 
illustrate your point.

Yeah, that makes it better. /roll

Now you're just putting words into my mouth. That's not at all what I 
said. I said the former was not as bad as the latter, of which your 
reference as simple murder falls far short of conveying its severity.

Grandstand all you like, pal. That last bit there sums up the main point 
I am trying to make here. There is a big difference.
