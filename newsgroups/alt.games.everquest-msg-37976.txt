Of course this is a matter of personal opinion, but for myself...

Up to level 40, I never saw the need for it.  Not even worth the effort of
going out of the way to get one.   Post 40 it starts to hurt a bit if you
don't get any experience back at all.   Post 50 it becomes "necessary" if you
want to continue to advance at a somewhat decent rate.  Even downgrading to a
39 rez will cost you hours of fighting time.

At 54, it hasn't yet gotten to the point where I need a 56 resurrection.  If
the cleric there has it, great, if they don't, no big deal.   I'd expect that
won't change until 59, since the difference between 90 and 96 experience
returned is so minimal.  At 59 though, when you have to get several kills to
make the experience bar move one blue pixel...   every blue pixel that can
possibly be returned will probably be important.
