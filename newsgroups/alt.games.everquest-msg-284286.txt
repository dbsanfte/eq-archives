Is this still true, at the low end?  Certainly, that's the perception,
borne out by the way enchanters used to play.  After the spell revamp a
year or two ago, I noticed that my (admittedly rarely-played) lowbie
enchanter got much better at nuking.  Their nukes used to have an
8-second recast timer, which was completely removed.  I don't think you
would confuse one with a wizard, but my impression was that their
offensive options were much improved.  If the second enchanter throws
Berserker Strength (a brief STR buff + weak Rune with no material
component) on the melees, nukes and assists with buffing/slowing/CC,
that's a solid contribution.  A second enchanter may not be the most
minmaxed use of a group slot, but it doesn't seem like one would be
dead weight either.  Of course, overcoming this perception might be
more work than the OP wants...

Oh, and Lance's posts make it sound like Kunark will be opening on the
Progression server soon.  The OP could be the first kid on the block
with a shiny new iksar to play! :)
