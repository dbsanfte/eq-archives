I know that Wizards aren't expected to melee.  (Indeed, one could
make stronger statements. :-)  Nevertheless, I like to have some
chance to do damage when oom, so I try to find opportunities to
poke and bash mobs when it doesn't risk wiping.  On the other hand,
once my few combat skills have reached their level caps, I can go
back to nuking and medding and stop pretending that my melee DPS
matters. :-)  So I've been trying to determine what those level
caps are.

The Graffe web site doesn't seem to discuss melee skill caps at
all.  (Not surprising, given how little melee a Wizard is expected
to do.)  Caster's Realm gives skill caps, and they seem to be
correct for weapon skills (e.g. Piercing), but their caps for
Offense and Defense are clearly wrong.  My own wizard exceeded
the stated defense cap, and there are comments posted on the site
from other readers who also found the caps to be low.  Some of
those readers speculated on the correct formula, e.g. thinking it
might be 5*level as it is for many other classes.  But I decided
to find out for myself.

So I made new Wizard, putting my extra stat points into DEX/AGI
in case those helped skill up faster, and spent a while in the
tutorial trying do lots of melee while stopping short of killing
things because I didn't want to level up.  Several corpses later,
I concluded that the caps are 5*level for Def, but 4*level for Off.

Are there any Wizards out there who can confirm or contradict these
caps?
