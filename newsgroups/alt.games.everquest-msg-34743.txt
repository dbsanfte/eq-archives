I've found out by trial and error that this can actually go down to the
specific loot item, at least in Everfrost/Halas.  Cindl in Mac's Kilts pays
better for almost everything pelt-related (inclding dropped cloth armor),
while I get a better price for Mammoth Calf Tusks and the bronze dropped by
Orcish Mountaineers from Starn Bearjumper.
