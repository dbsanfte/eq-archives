IMO, you would be better off singing VoV with no chanter haste in the group 
and using Rondo for the extra str/atk/DS when you do have chanter haste. 
Although it won't stack haste effects, it will give you the other benefits 
of the song.

In any case, everything about bards is situational. You have to always take 
into account the group make up and go with what works best for the 
situation you are in. That's what makes being a bard so great - 
versatility.
