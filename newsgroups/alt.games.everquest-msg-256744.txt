The INT (and WIS) cap is 255 until level 60. From level 60 to 65, the cap
increases by 5 per level, for a level 65 cap of 280.
You can then purchase AA abilities to raise the cap further, for a current
maximum of 355.

I haven't done any testing myself since the manabar was shown with a number,
but I'm sure someone in here can comment on the value of more INT vs. more
mana.
