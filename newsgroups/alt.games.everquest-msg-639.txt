My monk's mend skill is starting to get a good bit better. (It's
actually *worked* a couple of times now, he he he).  I have tried to
remember to keep hitting it all the time to keep improving the skill
level. (Currently in high twenties for 6th level monk, I believe).  But
my question is this:  Do I have to be seated and already injured for my
attempt at mend to count as practice towards improving level? I've hit
the button often either while running or during a battle, and it usually
fails (no surprise) but I also dont' seem to recall seeing the skill
level increase while participating in those activities. Do I have to sit
down first?
  Secondly, having gotten to 6th level, it may just be my imagination,
but it just feels like I'm running a lot faster than I used to and
faster than a lot of other PCs in the area.  Does my speed increase as I
go up in level, and how long before I don't even need SoW anymore
(hopeful grin)?  :-)
  Human monk, by the way.
