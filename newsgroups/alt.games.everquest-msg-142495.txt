What is the trinity?

Warriors
Need 3-4 of them max. Can often make do with 1 or 2. If you're letting
your primary warriors die, what hope have the lesser equipped, lesser
experienced warriors got of staying alive. Never seen a raid cancelled
for lack of warriors.

Clerics
Need numbers, nothing more. The best equipped, best skiled clerics on
the server is equivalent to a triple-botted L60 mule once they're in a
rotation. The only difference is that the mule needs to chug more rods.

Enchanters
With the exception of Vox, Emp, HP, and some of VT, name a raid where
you *need* more than 2 boted enchanters?

The 'holy trinity' is a legacy of LGuk days. Pal/SK are still suffering
from the misconceptions of those days, though rogues have escaped them
