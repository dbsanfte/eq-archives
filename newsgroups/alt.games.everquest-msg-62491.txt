  This is a problem some people have been having... I had it myself once.
It went away after I rebooted, and that's what I hear a GM in the chat room
suggest.  Try that if you already haven't... otherwise, I dunno.  Try the
EverQuest tech support board.

  I think the next month or so things are going to be really messy.  Verant
is obviously doing a rush job with this Luclin/DX8 thing.  We'll probably
come out okay in the end, but the road there is going to be a bumpy one.
