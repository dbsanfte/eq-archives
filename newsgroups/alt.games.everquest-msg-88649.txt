I would straight out give him one and see what he does. If you don't get any
exp or faction for it, don't waste your belts giving him more. :) If you
have 64 belts and you're lvl 9, you should get a pretty good amount of
experience and you'll also get some nice faction. Way better than anything
you'd get by just selling them.
