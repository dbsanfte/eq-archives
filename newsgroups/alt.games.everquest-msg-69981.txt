I have a lvl 15 warrior that I haven't messed with in ages because she can
no longer group with the ones she was used to being with. They've all moved
on or gone over to DAoC. Was thinking of giving her gear to my cleric (same
race), whichever of it she might find useful. Hate to let my warrior go, but
I can't always count on a group and I actually -like- to solo. Can't solo
very well with warrior-type.
