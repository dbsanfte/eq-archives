I don't mean to be picky but this bugged me.  You can't be "zerged" by
a single mob.  The term comes from the game Starcraft.  One of the
Zerg's specialties was mass producing lots of relatively weak
creatures that could attack in overwhelming numbers.  For example, a
raid using a zerg force implies that they don't know what the hell
they are doing, or have crappy gear or low level participants...but
they still win because they bring so many to the fight.

The force that brought down the Sleeper might be considered the
ultimate zerg force to date in EQ.
