Ok:

Dwarves

PROS
Best trade skill city in the game
2 of the coolest quests in the game (rings and shawls)
Already start out with decent faction
Quest armor is easier to come by than the other factions
Thurgadin gate potions
You can kill both Giants and Dragons for 1337 gear
Can be raised simultaneously with Dragons
The ability to take a level 1 character and sit in icewell and collect RFV
armor which your local Uberguild will leave to rot when they do the Dain.

CONS
The quest armor is sub-par compared to the other factions
You won't be able to spend time killing in Icewell for RFV armor
You'll be KoS to the giants, who tend to hit a lot harder than the dwarves
You need to run through the KoS Giant city and Dragon city at least once to
get the keys for WL and CS ports
You can't kill the Dain for his nice crown

Giants

PROS
The highest AC quest armor of all 3 factions
Safe passage through Kael
Incredible rewards for killing the Dain and Yelinak
Huge city so that fatties can get around ok
Access to killing all mobs in ToV and Icewell

CONS
No killing of giants for some of the incredible stuff that drops in Kael
No Ring/Shawl quests
No killing of Tormax for his nice crown
No killing the AoW


Dragons

PROS
Arguably best statted quest armor of all 3 factions
Higher drop rates of plate quest armor in HoT
Safe passage through WL and SS
Incredible rewards for quests in ToV
Can be raised simultaneously with dwarves
Safer passage to PoM in ToV

CONS
No killing of Woushi
No killing the named dragons in WW
Limited killing in ToV
No killing of Yelinak
No pharming of Guardian or Sentry armor
