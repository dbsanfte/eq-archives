Well I didn't mean to come across sounding like a wiseass, I should have
left you the answer but I honestly didn't understand what the problem was.
There is a Save button that allows you to save a songlist, but I see that
someone else has provided this information.

Here's a bigger issue I have with the MP3 player: it completely takes over
your music experience, which is not what I want it to do. Part of the appeal
of music is the pacing and the atmospheric element it adds. I'll never
forget the first time I saw the E. Karana bridge, or the city of Kaladim;
the musical fanfare grew extra little goosebumps on the back of my neck and
I still remember my exhiliration. I also depend on the music to confirm that
I'm in Attack mode, it adds drama to the experience. I enjoy listening to
the soundtrack of LOTR while I'm wandering around Norrath, but somehow the
idea of transitioning into Attack mode while Enya is cooing a ballad just
doesn't feel right. I want the context sensitive music experience, I want to
be jarred into the sounds of battle.

So, after doing a little research I noticed that all of the music files in
the EQ directory are actually .mp3 files. So the solution seemed simple.
Just replace the EQ .mp3's with music files that I wanted, rename them to
the EQ names (e.g., "combattheme1.mp3") and I'm set, right? Well not
exactly. The first time you fire up the EQ patcher it scans your hard disk
and notices that the file named "combattheme1.mp3" doesn't look anything
like the one that it expects to be there, and so it downloads the "correct"
one and overwrites your existing one. D'oh!

Another approach was needed. I thought, perhaps the launcher is smart enough
to know that file names alone aren't enough to sufficiently identify the
correct file. After all, sometimes particular files are updated so the
patcher couldn't rely on the existence of a filename alone, it would have to
check the timestamp to verify that it's a particular time and date. So, I
scouted around on the Internet and located a utility that would allow me to
change a file's timestamp to whatever I wanted it to be. I verified the
timestamp of the original music files, renamed my music files to correspond
to the EQ names and then edited their timestamps to be identical to the
originals. That ought to be enough.

But nope, "Downloading combattheme1.mp3 ..." In their wisdom, SOE decided
that filename and timestamp were *not* enough and any attempt to fool them
with these meager tactics is not going to cut it. The only conclusion I can
come to at this point is that they're also checking the file *size*, and
there's no simple way that I know of to fool the patcher into thinking the
files are of a different size than they actually are.  So, no dice.

Ok, so I have another idea. I'll create a directory with the songs that I
want to hear, and another directory with copies of the original EQ mp3's,
and then launch the game as usual, turning OFF the "Autoplay" checkbox so
that once the File Scan is complete, I can then bring up the Windows
Explorer and copy my music files to the EQ directory. Once that's done, I
can hit Play and I'm off to the races. And it works! But ... after I shut
down and try to relaunch the game again, I now have to sit through
"Downloading ..." every single file that I've changed.  Ugh.

So it appears that the best solution I've come up with to date involves
complex batch files that do the file copying and renaming in between the
Autoplay-->Play gap, and then another batch file to restore the originals
when I quit so that I don't have to sit through another download. I'm hoping
that there's a better solution and that someone reading this account knows
that solution.

Anyone?
