Having killed a fair number of NPCs for quests, I imagine the intent is for
more of the "Kill the messenger and get the note" type quests to be added. I
kind of like reading the notes and they are often written in something other
then common.

Some of the existing quests, like Gnasher's Head/BB Stout Shipment do not
require you to speak Gnoll to deal with him, but it may be added at some
later date.
