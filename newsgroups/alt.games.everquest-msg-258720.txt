The first time I tried to use the tutorial (i.e., the first new character
I created after it got added), I crashed just as I entered.  When I came
back in, I was in Gloomingdeep, having missed the intro scenario.  Not
only did it mean I was missing the kobold shackles for the merchant (some
kind soul bought a set for me off the merchant so I could sell them back),
but I also missed most of the explanations of how to move, how to fight,
how to interact with NPCs, etc.  I didn't need them, but it did leave me
wondering just how instructive the tutorial was.  Eventually I learned
that there was a big chunk I'd missed.

That initial fight and then giving the key to free Arias is generally
enough to make level 2, or close to it, so it's a great way to kickstart
a new character.
