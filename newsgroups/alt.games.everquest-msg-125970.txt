I -sooo- need that.  I've gone out of town and I'm unable, as yet, to 
locate a computer with all the requisite features and an ISP, so I haven't 
been able to play in a week!  Ach, the withdrawals!  And there's one 
person in particular that I'd -love- to get in touch with, but can't.  
Sigh... why can't I use some minimal chat client and telnet to 
ayonaero.everquest.com and send a message... Why can't they just make EQ 
compatible with irc clients...
