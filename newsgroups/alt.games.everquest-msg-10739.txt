Well, you may have gotten that out of the original post, but I didn't.
It didn't seem clear to me whether or not they attacked it first. I
would think, though, that if someone has only attacked a MOB's ally, and
not the MOB itself, that as soon as someone else hits them, it will go
after the person who directly attacked it. I haven't tried this out yet,
but I think it might be worth a shot. If my theory is correct, then it
would, in fact, be a kill steal.
