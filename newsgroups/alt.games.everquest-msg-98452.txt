I did do it with DAOC around well 1-53 anyway. To say that EQ must
become more like DAOC to compete is to say that DAOC is the better
game...err maybe I should go try DAOC just to see what scares verant
so much....

OH thats right I already did..guess what guys it not bad...different
but not worse than EQ and its player personality that decides which is
best. THey have come a long way in the last year, cant say the same
for EQ its seems to be backing up.....especialy in satisfiing
customers.

Now as for more players I think you are going to see a kind of level
log jam for a while to come. Ever been in traffic thats stalled then
the path clears briefly only to stall again. Only so many mobs out
there and to be honest a lot of places are crowded now. Get a great
mass of ppl within 5 levels of each other and see what happens.

OBTW on a different subject, to say that good patch procedures dont
have to be used at verant because it's not a hospital is lame. No one
dies at the bank either but bet your arse we got a backout plan. Arent
ya glad we do?

Fact is EQs code may be so buggy and badly written that nothing short
of a rewrite can stop this crap, err...do we really want these clowns
doing a rewrite? Arrrgg
