As for the usefulness of the shaman epic drops, I used my SoW boots for
about one day after I got them, then I got GEBs.  I never used any of the
other drops, as I already had better.  I could see keeping the SoW boots
handy, for the instacast SoW, but, I just don't have room to keep them in an
inventory slot, so, they are languishing in one of my bags somewhere.
