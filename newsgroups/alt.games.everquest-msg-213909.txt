Every month or so they (supposedly) run through the guild rosters and kill
any guild that does not have 10 members with active EQ accounts.  That may
not happen anymore, it's been a while.

note that if you fall below 10 members and they zap the guild, the name is
still yours, and you can have it remade later, without the approval process.
You can even move it to another server according to one post I read.
Also the creator can take back the guildleader position at any time simply
by /petitioning and requesting it.

I think you get an email to that effect. Also there's a guild status page in
the chat section iirc.
   1) Server-wide
   2) afaik yes, no definate direct links to other organizations. Though
parody names seem fine.
I don't think stupid disqualifies, from some of the guild names I've seen.
Tell them it's supposed to be Dark Elvish if they ask. Offensive does,
however, qualify as a nono. I presume of course that the GM has final say,
and can nuke your name just because he is in a bad mood. Mind you, there's
no definitive list of existing guilds, so you may have to try a few times
(Company of Shadows was like our 12th choice, and we were grasping at
straws.) Also, names TOO close to another guild (on or off the server) may
require approval of the creator (guild leader if they are no longer active)
of the other guild (If you want  <Company of the Shadows>, you may have to
get approval from my guildleader. I may be wrong there, that's just
something I heard.

Oh yeah. 1 account may only create one guild, period. You may never create
another.
> 3. Is there a good link for just how one does these things?  (Ie, I know
> you have to log out and go into "chat" but that's the extent of it...)
Been far too long, I don't remember. It was somewhere on the live site
though iirc.
Proceedure goes something like this:
Get 10 people to come to your chat room for guild creation and type
#guildapprove.
Wait 2 weeks for them to tell you you can't use your name.
submit a new name, get a response 3 days later saying it's taken as well.
Repeat 10 times.
Get your confirmation email after submitting a name that passes, and get
online with 9 others you want to be in the guild, able to get to the same
location rather quickly.
/petition, and prepare to wait.
Wait some more
A bit more.
just a little longer.
the server will go down, so you have to do this tomorrow I guess.
Not do it tomorrow, because only 4 people that you are putting in the guild
are online.
Ah Thursday, everyone can be on Thursday evening.
/petition, isp's backbone provider gets backhoe warrior'd just as the server
gm shows up 10 min later.
Try again Saturday, /petition and wait.
and wait
and wait
and wait
and wait
and wait
ahh petition answered, get everyone there in a hurry, server gm may be nice
enough to /summon the one idiot who didn't understand 'stay around here' and
ran from Freeport to Erudin while you were waiting!! and bing, welcome to
your new guild.
