You mean the Elites?   LOL.
FYI:  Kill all the frosties you want but, sooner or later you will have to get
over to Kael at the WL  zone in side and kill from there in order to raise yoru
faction  to dubious with the Dragons.   At least that was the way it was with
me. I  killed giants in GD until I was blue on the face, and could not get 
Coldain faction above  warm  or whatever the one just  below ally is.  but my
CoV faction was frozen at threatening.

It was the same with the  Kael Giants from the  EW side of the zone to the Bank
area.   But one evening at the WL  zone side into KD tapping Frosties for
faction, moved  me to dubious  CoV faction.

Just one  Druid's experience.
