A couple of my guildies are working on getting to that stage, one of
them killed the corruptor yesterday.
It's important for druids and rangers to note that if they help in
this fight before doing the earlier steps in the quest (handing in
coins to a DE in kith forest), the resulting faction hit will make the
DE in Kith dislike them enough to not give them the quest item.
Or so I heard.
