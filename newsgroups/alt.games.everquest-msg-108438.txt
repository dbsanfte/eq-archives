My cleric is thinking about starting her epic.  I notice the Lake
Rathe part, where Lord Bergurgle is to be camped, is a chain of events
leading up to turning in the Coral Statue of Tarew to a seeker in the
Tempe of Sol Ro.  This causes Plasmatic Priest  to spawn, the loot of
which is used later.  Has anyone completed the chain of events with a
non-cleric character in order to get the priest to spawn?
