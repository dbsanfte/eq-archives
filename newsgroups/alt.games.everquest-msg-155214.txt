That's what makes dungeons so fun though, I rarely hunt outdoors any more,
and when I do it's primarily crazy shit, or mindless exp grind.

Crazy shit list:
Solo Yvolcarn (immune to runspeed changes)
Solo Ice Burrowers (x 4) level 61, don't summon, proc dispel on melee
Solo Elysians (x lots)
Solo 4-arms (x 5 + 2 deaths; they're hard)

Mindless grind list:
Othmir
Othmir
Othmir
Othmir
Sentient Armor

Dungeon fun:
Solo Phase Spiders in DN
Solo just about anything in entry/basement/north HS
Solo stuff at the bank in Kael
Solo a little bit in Chardok then pull a train and gate
Solo enthralled ulthork/molkor/bulthar in SG with charmed walrus/sea
elephant/manatee
Solo entry to uzo of Seb (wizard frogs suck) while fruitlessly LFG
Solo just about anything blue in Karnors
/shout LFG and then give up in Velks because there's nothing to kill
