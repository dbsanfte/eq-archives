So far, my P233 MMX with 96 MB RAM and a TNT2 video card (32 meg) seems to
be running EQ fine.  I only play in the original zones and Kunark, and have
Velious installed, but haven't visited the continent yet.  Other than the
"big font" problem that I (and several others, it seems) have experienced,
and the fact that each zone takes 3 or 4 times longer to load than before,
I've had no problems playing the game on my system after this latest round
of patches.

Question is...  Should I expect things to go this smothly in future, or will
I eventually come to a point where I'll no longer be able to play, and be
forced to buy a new board and processor?

Oh...  No problems other than the fact that after zoning to and from North
Kaladim to South Kaladim about 3 or so times, the game froze, and I was
forced to hard boot the system.  This happened on the "Role Playing Prefered
server," with a new character.  I haven't noticed this on my regular
characters yet...
