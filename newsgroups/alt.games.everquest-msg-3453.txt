Gee Dan and I had thought you were coming over to the other side.<sigh>
I think if you put a little more thought into it you would see that the
ones that might be destroying the ng are the people who oppose these new
comers.
The indisputable evidence that my isp receives over 30 complaints a day
they have to ignore and laugh about. It is still Internet America btw.
That is my lousy daytime connect anyway. You must wonder what low self
esteem these people have and how proud they are have run to mommy to
tattle tale. The undeniable evidence that they were not able to remove
anyone again proving the constant failure rate of their efforts in real
life. Plus the fact that they are angry and  hissy fitting proves they
have lost emotionally.
It is my opinion we are here to improve this ng. Maybe even someday
existing harmoniously with the nerds. Overall your statement strikes me
as one of a person that has learned that the only way to remove someone
is to prove they are trying to destroy a ng. I believe you have targeted
the wrong people in that effort.
