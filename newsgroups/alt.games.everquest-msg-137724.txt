I have to admidt, - I did not know this.  Further, I did not know
there were "different" laws for killing the police.  If there are,
again, we're back to "attributes" once again....  Anyone can look
at a policeman, or an elderly person in a wheel chair and KNOW that
they are different. Killing a citizen, and having the family cry
fowl because of being gay, in not clear, not visable, not detectable.
I could see it in a court room now... Your honor, the victim was gay.
Judge: how do you know ?
Defence: Well, because he was. Wasn't he?. er, well, I "think", right?
Judge: Family?, how say you?
Family: Well, we "think" he was coming out, we'll maybe he didn't.
Judge: You'r not sure?
Family: Well, you see your honor, he was "confused".
Judge: Confused ??
Family: Well, yea, I mean, we're married with childred and all, but...
Judge: But ?
Family: well, he's be going to gay bars, and we suspect he is fact gay.
Judge:  er, boy...  You can sit down now.
