It's not that your body odor went away, it's that it changed, but since it's
yours, you don't notice it.  Have you noticed that many asians who stick to
asian diets have a smell to them?  It's not that they "have a smell," but
that their smell is different than the normal american (or brit, in your
case) smell.  It's kinda like the accents y'all have over there.
