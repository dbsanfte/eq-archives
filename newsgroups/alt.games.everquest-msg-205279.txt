simply put...

good things NEVER die...

ah yes, i remember my lvl 12 warriar ogre, Crash, k might not be right of
the book but my dm let me. my str wasn't 18, not even 18/00 but 20, 19 con
and 2 int hehe. "ugh, perdy culurs, sparkly toooo..." i alwasy found the
fewl gems and all other sparkling items and in turn was ALWAYS the meat
shield and when i my fiend cast bezzerk on me, look out lol... did i mention
i had a Mattock of the Titans ? raw power of a giant and the brain of a
squerl lol ;-)

TSR's D&D will always live in one form or another... i'm sure more educated
individual might say it was actually Tolkien that inspiered the whole thing
?? not sure...
