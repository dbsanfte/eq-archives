I don't know how things stand today, but I can speak from past experience.
I believe that a person can tell what type of economy exists by looking at
where the players gather.

EQ, as you know, has an economy centered around NPCs.  You'll find the
greatest concentration of players around NPCs.  Also, these areas that
attract the most players have no support (ovens, forges, brew kettles) for
player-based trade skills, so most players eschew the trade skills
altogether.

UO has a player-driven economy where the cities are truly the economic
centers of the online world.  The value of gold may be a big problem in UO,
as well as available real estate; but even I must admit that the UO trade
skills were a joy.
