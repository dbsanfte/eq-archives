Athlon 2800+ (2.25Ghz)
nVidia nForce2 motherboard
1024 Mb PC2700 DDR ram
ATI Radeon 9700 PRO 128Mb
audigy soundcard
40Gb IBM deskstar 120GXP 7200rpm hard drive

That was a bit of an exaggeration to say a 'lot' of video lag, but it
shouldnt be there at all at this point.  Testing it in plane of Tranquility
I can pretty much guarantee one pause if I run in a circle once.  Changing
settings high or low doesn't make it better or worse.
