True, but in this particular instance what's happening is that you are 
the one telling the astronauts that the moon is made of cheese.

As far as I'm concerned, now that the flagging requirements have been 
removed for those planes, I will play again (as soon as I finish Vice

I had hit an unsurmountable wall. So yay for Sony.
