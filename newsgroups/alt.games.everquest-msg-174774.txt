Because, all other things being equal, rogues are superior DPS to any
of them. At an equal level of equippage, over a series of short burst
fights like ToE, I'll put my money on a rogue every time, based on
high initial DPS, a near-guaranteed 41% worn haste, faster aggro
reduction and decent burst damage discs. Building a five-man team that
can usher others through the trials is a game of inches and I still
think that I outdamage anyone at my level with roughly the same level
of gear and AAs in these situations.

For obvious reasons, I've never seen a rogueless group pass the
trials. But, on top of that, I've seen more rogues = better in the
50ish trial runs I've done with guildies and friends.
