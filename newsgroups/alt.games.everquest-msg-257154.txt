Hmm, whenever I have seen it, it has come over the hill and been heading 
towards the river.

I've had it assist when I have been killing other beasties of all sorts. 
I have never had it aggro me directly if I have been 'between mobs'. 
There's a nasty hynid which puts in an appearance occasionally too.

I have taken to fighting on the flat 'plain' across the river from the 
wayfarers camp.  I sit of a rock watching the world around me until I 
spot a mob which is clear of any others the pull it to the slope 
directly opposite (i.e. Across the river) the wayfarers camp.  From 
there I fear kite it letting my DOTs and pet eat it.

 From my experience, hynids and stonemites will assist each other if they 
get close.  The regular cragbeasts seem to be variable at assisting 
anything.
