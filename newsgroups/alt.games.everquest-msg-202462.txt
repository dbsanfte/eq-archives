LOL!

It's about freaking time they made this change.  I wouldn't consider
it a nerf to KEI though.  I think it's a nerf of the exploit for
low-level players to get KEI.  Now the KEI addicts will have to settle
(ha!) for Clarity.  No more of this nonsense where low to mid level
groups only took casters that had KEI on them.  No more of this
nonsense where casters were leaving groups, expecting their spot to be
held, just so they can get a KEI refresh.
