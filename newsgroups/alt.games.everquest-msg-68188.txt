It's the real one. You can now send all of your whiny complaints
directly to him at this address.

Christ almighty, when he *did* read this newsgroup openly, you
couldn't read the group without a kill filter on the word "BRAD" in
the subject field for all the whiny little crybabies who wanted his
ear.

Brad, it's a great game, but if you're lurking, please keep it that
way. The signal:noise ratio is bad enough as it is.
