I am a bard and just finished killing Blackwing who is drake actually but
pops in the same area, for my epic. While there we killed him about 10 times
until all the bards in the guild got his guts. In the meantime we took out
Zazamoukh each time that it popped. We were all spread out when Rharzar
popped, and d/t lack of organization he killed a few of my guildmates. I
turned on selos and kinda ran him around til rezzez were done, then we got
our act together and killed him 3 times. 2 for the SK's in the guild who
need a piece of him for their epic, and the last time for revenge (gave it
to an SK in the zone.) Rharzar is tiny and green, and looks like an emerald
drake. Make no mistake though he is a badass, around lvl 55 I believe. Was
fun to see him go down.
