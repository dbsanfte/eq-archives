I doubt if it will help, but it'll only take a moment to try it. 
Until approximately a week ago I could not run EQ unless I had the EQ
homepage open in Internet Explorer.  I would start up IE with the EQ
page as my homepage, minimize it, then start EQ.  Stupid as it sounds,
this is how I played for about 3 months.  I figured it was much
simpler than trying to explain it to some tech support screener.  

Good Luck...
