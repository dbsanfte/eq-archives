There's a clicky earring with it, if I recall correctly, which would 
take care of the memming part.

And there's the shaman boots they end up with as part of their epic with 
insta click SOW.

If the earring is shaman wearable, then they might as well use Scale to 
travel around, they've got SOW as a backup if it drops, why not?

Casting it on a fellow player though, well thats just got to be a cruel 
prank!
