    It's a bit of a sore point with warriors, so they're ambivalent. /shield
only stops melee damage, correct me if I'm wrong? And since only one person
can have a /shield on them, the question warriors have is this:

    Instead of using some lame /shield command, why not just improve my
frigging TAUNT skill so I can TAUNT the mob off whoever is getting beat on?

    This is what /shield is, after all - an ability to be used when you
can't taunt or gain aggro quickly enough. And warriors are pretty sore about
how broken Taunt is.

    Ideally, every class with Taunt should get /shield since the two are
meant to be used the same way (saving others by drawing damage onto
yourself).
