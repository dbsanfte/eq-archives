I thought it was the language of the Combine Empire, forefathers of the
barbarians, and the guys responsible for most of the TP spots all over
Norrath. Some caster research texts are written in Combine, I believe,
but there's no real need to be fluent in it (or the other research
languages like Elder Dragon, etc) since theres no need to actually read
the in-game books and scrolls and what have you - everyone just wanders
over to http://eq.castersrealm.com when they need to know what rune to
combine with what to research some spell, etc.
