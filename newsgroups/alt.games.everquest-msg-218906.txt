Teckla has basically described the DAoC buffing system, and from having
played a buffing class in DAoC I have to say I prefer EQ's. Nothing like
having to rebuff your entire group because you died to run up the tedium
factor far more than the 20 min or so refresh on EQ buffs. I have no
idea why they'd nerf the duration on one low level druid/ranger buff
like that but maybe it's just a bug.
