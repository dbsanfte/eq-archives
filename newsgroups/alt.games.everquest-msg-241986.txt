Hi gang - I posted a message about the dreaded black screen of death when
going into windows mode on the Allakazam site.  This fix was posted in the
newsgroup - I tried it and it works for me:

I was having the same problem, using winXP and GeForce FX5600.  Alt-tab was
broken and if I switched between window and full screen it would go black
and then crash.

I found this fix on the EQ boards and this worked for me:

  Here is what I did this morning, I hope it helps you. Right click on the
desktop and open up the Settings on the display properties pop-up. Click the
advanced button and then the tab for my video card (GeForce4 Ti 4800 SE). I
selected the Performance and Quality Section of that area and unselected the
"application-controlled" check box on the Antialiasing settings.

Here is the link to the thread if you want to read it all:

http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=tech&message.id=14494&highlight=alt+tab+compatibility+toolkit&no_redir=true

Basically, this turns off antialiasing (I left the antialiasing slider at
"0"). I have no idea why this worked. I assume they have incompatible code
for many of our video cards and that once they fix it on their end, we can
turn antialiasing back on.

Hope this helps!
