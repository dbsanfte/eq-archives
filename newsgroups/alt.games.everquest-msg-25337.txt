If you have a newbie ranger, stick him at the cave entrance
if you can (will need EB for this as a newbie)  Then when
you log on to eq, just check if the bear is up, and high
tail it back.  I know there is a room, you can go to that
the bear will pop at, or path by, but the lich doesn't enter
the room, you will see him go by, but he won't aggro you. 
There are some static Iced Bone skellies in this room.  The
bear has a place holder to I have heard, of some wandering
Iced Bones.  I will try to find out from my friend, (I just
did the tracking check for the bear, and iced bones) where
she got the info, and post the links here.
