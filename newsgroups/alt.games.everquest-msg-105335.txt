You'll do nothing at the end-game soloing.  People don't like career 
soloers in their groups or on their raids.  Inexperience leads to death, 
lots and lots of death.
Raids are only long and boring if you don't know what you're doing.  My 
total time playing last night was under 60 minutes.  Enough time to log 
on, run to Umbral Plains, clear guards, kill Rumblecrush, and distribute 
the loot.  Pickup raids with soloers do suck ass.  Pickup raids with 
people who know what they're doing are fun.
As to your assertion that you need to kill 6 times as many mobs to get the 
same exp, it's actually not true.  There are exp bonuses for grouping, so 
you actually only have to kill about 5 times as many mobs, which should be 
trivial for a well-balanced group.  I would say that the best groups can 
kill 10 times the number of mobs that a solo druid can kill at your level.  
Just incase you can't do the math, 10/6 > 1. 
The loot that the average druid can solo at high-20s isn't that great 
anyway, certainly not as good as a group of similar people could get.

Hmm, you know, it seems that the people who complain most about grouping 
tend to be the same people who complain the most about everything.  They 
also seem to be the ones who end up soloing because nobody wants to group 
or raid with them.  I've gone back over my old screenshots, and I am 
amazed at how many of the folks I grouped with in Highkeep and SolB are 
guildies and friends now.  I also see people who I know are in my server's 
uberest guilds.  Not the grief guilds, the truly uber.  Obviously people 
are learning valuble skills there.
