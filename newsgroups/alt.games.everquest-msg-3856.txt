In other words, one of the pieces that has me working on melee in the
hope that I'll get something like that one day :) (Current weapons:
velium scimitar 5/24, fier'dal morning star 9/35 and observer staff
12/35 ..skills are 101, 99 and 98 at the moment)

A guildie has a velium etched stone mace for sale, 7/22 and better
stats than my morning star. I am going to try to save up to buy it off
of him :)
