Dragons are a good bit harder to please than Thurgadin Dorfs but ally
with Thurgadin should (and I stress *should*) be good enough for
Wooooooshi not to chain root you to death on landing.

There's a mob in GD that you can check CoV faction with but it's
rather hidden away in the Wurm caves and some of those Wurms randomly
see invis so instead of risking becoming Wurm fodder I'd recommend
blagging a lift to Cobalt Scar to check when you think you're close
(ally with Dorfs should work).
