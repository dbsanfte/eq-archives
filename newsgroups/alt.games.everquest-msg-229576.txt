Logic suggests this would work.

Sadly, logic loses.

Not only does See Invis fail to prevent pet from suiciding when its own 
goes invis, pet also kills itself if owner gets Invis to Undead (ok, 
necro pets should suicide for this but not for regular invis) or Invis 
to Animals (ok, shaman, druid, beastlord pets should kill themselves on 
this as well as regular invis... but not ITU)

If your pet is charmed, any of the above will break the charm, again, 
whether it makes sense or not.  This means one of the most sought after 
items in the game for charming classes is the Goblin Gazuli Ring, an 
otherwise nearly useless item which grants the amazing power to invis 
yourself to animals, instantly.  There being so few areas where ITA is 
actually both necessary and useful, this would be no more than a 
footnote if it didn't also break charm on demand.

Splendid
