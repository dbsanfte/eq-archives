Go with a class that compliments them.  Pretty much anybody that can
heal will be a great boon.  Rangers, Paladins, Clerics, Druids,
Beastloards, Necros, Bards, Shaman.  Shaman probably isn't the best
since the slow/haste don't stack.  All of them have thier place though.

Avoid Wizards.  My RL best friend is a wizard and we just don't seem to
work out too well togeather.
