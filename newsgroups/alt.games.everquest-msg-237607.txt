Thanks for the links. Very helpful.
I decided to go with a Halfling Druid. I also considered Shaman but I 
really wanted to play a halfling so that tipped me over to Druid.

The other thing I like about Druids is that I will be able to learn how 
to solo and how to function in groups. I need work on both aspects for sure.

I'm up to level 4 and two things jump out at me.

1. Leveling up is much faster and easier with the Druid than with the 
Rogue. I never seem in danger of dying with my Druid (Feddo) whereas the 
Rogue would barely survive each combat up until about lvl 5.

2. I have no money for spells. What are good things to hunt in Misty 
Thicket to get money? Should I try a different zone altogether?

Anyway, I'm enjoying the Druid so far although it is mostly just 
meleeing so far.
