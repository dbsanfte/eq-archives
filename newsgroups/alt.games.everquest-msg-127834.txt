This doesn't interact with the game software either. It just reads your log
file. Your log file can be completely seperate to the EQ directory.

No packet sniffing. No access to the eq directory. Not even running on the
same machine. A matter of fact, the programs capabilities is out of the
territory of what VI can actually decide is cheating and well into the
territory of what is none of their (or your) business.

People on high horses should never let themselves become ignorant of simple
physics DT - they have further to fall.
