Only thing you need to get into any of the Barindu expeditions is GoD 
activated on your account.  Note that you won't get flags from the 
expeditions unless the person getting the expedition has completed the 
previous flags (at least this was rumored to be the case, I haven't heard 
of anybody not getting a flagging expedition).
