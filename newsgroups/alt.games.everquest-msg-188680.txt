They are not equal.  The number of levels below you that a mob will still 
con dark blue is dependant on your level.  The dark blue mobs can have a 
range of 15? levels below you up to level 60 (not counting some of the low 
levels maybe).  The amount of xp a mob is worth is based on the level of 
the mob, the zone you are in, and whether you are in a group or a raid or 
solo.
