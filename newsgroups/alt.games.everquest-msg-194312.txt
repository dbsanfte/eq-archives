We've been using Pacification or Harmony (much cheaper) to move up to the BOT
tower named very successfully.  Requires knowing the place, and which mobs the
plan isn't going to work well on, and where stopping points are, but we move 20
or 30 people past dozens of mobs, stopping and fighting a few here, a few more
there, then moving again.

Invis is spottier, but we've used that too in many places, the key again is
short runs where you know what you are moving past.  Invis tends to go blinky
for a little while before dropping, if your runs are short you can usually get
past the mobs even if its fading while you run.  If thats not possible, or fails
to work out, you just die in place (-not- training the safe spot) and consent a
dragger.  Often we do this in places where we are perfectly capable of killing
all the mobs on the way, but just don't want to have to bother doing so; ten
minutes to get into position instead of an hour of mindless lowbie mob killing
is much prefered, even if it does mean a couple people die and get dragged up
and rezzed.  The Hole comes to mind as a prime example.
