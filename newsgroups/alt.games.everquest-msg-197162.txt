My ranger and wizard friend played Hollowshade a LOT when the owlbears were
blue to us and just LOVED it. 
At that time, Grimling Forest was dark blue to us.  We tried playing there in 3
or 4 different places and had no luck whatsover, the grimlings are immune to
Harmony and Harmony of nature, when you pulled, you pulled the whole village.  
The sonics roamed and added and are immune to slow, root and fear if I recall
correctly.  
It was a nightmare and a mess and we just decided not even worth the trouble. 
We totally understood why the zone was always empty.
