Gah, now I find it hard not to flame you, but I shall resist temptation :)

----
How does the grouping work with exp and other levs in group.  Such
as.......a lev 25 grouping witha 30....and so on........What are the
limits of getting exp with groups?  Is there a website that shows this?

What types of rezzes are there and  what do each do?   Or a website that
tells this info.
----

You ask twice in your msg for a website with that info, I provide one and
now you also ask for it off the top of our heads?  Why type something out
again when it is already done up so nicely in many different places.
However, to humor you as you seem to be a lazy sack of shit (ok, a small
flame :p )  here goes:

Rez Level 29 - Revive:  Teleports the dead guy to his body, no xp restored
but saves a potential long run
Rez Level 39 - Ressusitate: Teleports the guy to the stiff for item retrival
and also restores ~40% (iirc) of the lost XP
Rez Level 49 - Resurrection: Gets guy to body and restores ~90%
Rez Level 56 - I forget: Gets guy to body and restores ~96%

Grouping:
There is a limit to some extent, however as you increase in levels the
grouping level also increases.  For example, at level 45 you can group with
a lvl 60 and still get XP.  There is some math formula which is around on
the ng/web which will give you more details.  At lower levels I think it is
around 5 or 10 lvls difference.
