The problem is that I slow waaaay down when I'm in a group or a crowded
zone.  In ecommons I'm getting about two frames per second in the tunnel.  I
don't have SOL and all my performance settings are set to the lowest setting
to save memory, yet I still can hardly play in certain areas.  My mouse even
lags constantly and even disappears for a second on occasion.

I'm running a Celeron 800, 512 mb of PC133 ram, TNT2 32meg Video Card, and
cable connection (connecting at close to 300,000).

All of my hardware is well above system requirements and I have no conflicts
in any of my devices.

Any idea what my problem may be?  A friend of mine thinks its because I'm
running a Celeron, but I don't really think that's it.
