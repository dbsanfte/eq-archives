Any level 55+ mobs will load this spell.  That means:

1.  Dragon Necropolis--the stuff that's in deeper and not the phase
spiders.
2.  Siren's Grotto--again, stuff past the zoneline.
3.  Western Wastes, almost all the dragons load spells (this is one of
the possible drops off them).  Many of the non-named trash that roams
here can also load this (yes, the implication that many of the
non-named roaming trash is 55+...the ice burrowers are level
61/62...have fun).
4.  Plane of Growth.  Again, off the level 55+ mobs.  Kill enough here
and you'll get a bunch of 55+ spells.
5.  Sleepers Tomb.  I agree, pretty damn stupid place to go to get
spells but believe me you'll get a LOT of spells...especially that god
damn necro (or is it SK) spell--forgot the name, but after the 5th
copy in as many mobs, we just started destorying them.
6.  Icewell, the higher level dorfs.  Watchers and named sentinels.
7.  Kael, the higher level giants, the same mobs that load the thurg
armor stuff.
8.  Temple of Veeshan, don't worry *EVERY* god damn thing here is
higher than level 55 (well, maybe the baby drakes in the Forbidden
Hall are lower but not much lower given that they all hit for over
200).  In the Questing Hall, every damn thing is 60+.

So no, there's no one specific mob you kill to get this spell.  It's
any level 55+ level mobs in Velious.  They can all potentially load
level 55+ spells and sometimes the "Useless Druid Pet Spell" is one of
them.

Fun wasting that much mana and having the damn bear poof due to
ripostes from the mob you're attacking....
