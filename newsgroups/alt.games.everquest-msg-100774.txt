After a (successfull) camp of Maid in MistMore we saw a light-blue
brownie scout.

At that time I was lvl 51 pally and friend was 51 ranger, both ok'ish
equipped and often soloing/duoing blues in DL. A light-blue?...pfffft,
no problem.
 
Ranger checked that brownie didn't have friends around. It did not, so
we decided to whack it for revenge 40 levels old or so...

We buffed a bit (not much, I didn't care to waste a symbol...) and
attacked.

The little bugger nuked, dotted and melee'd like a mad. He had us both
to 20% health before he turned (in fact I was a little lower and just
about to LoH). A single add and we would have end up very dead.

Avoid them. Not worth the trouble.
