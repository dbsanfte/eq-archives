I did call it "basic" stuff.  Anybody who understands that much can
avoid being a liability, which will get him the opportunity to learn
to be better.  I did not mean to imply that the Warrior equivalent
of "heal and med" was the be all and end all of playing a Warrior.
All I was pointing out was that good grouping skills ("good", not
"great", merely "good", as in "oh good, we finally found a tank who
stays on target" or "oh good, this one stops pulling when the healer
says LOM") aren't rocket science.  Yes, the other 80% of what you
can do as a Warrior will get you the last 20% of your effectiveness,
but anybody who understands the basics and can take direction when
appropriate can contribute usefully to most groups and raids, as is
true of most other classes.  And that person will likely learn with
experience and become better, there just isn't any need to take away
the fun to be had early in your playing career (the OP isn't even 30
yet, fer Pete's sake, were you an expert [whatever] by the time your
first character hit L28?).
