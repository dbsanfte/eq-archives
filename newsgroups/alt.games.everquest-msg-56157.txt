    It gets much worse. You get six DoT lines in addition to all the cool
utility stuff....

    If you still find it too expensive, then take it out (for now) and swap
in something. Since the pet is tanking a lot, I'd suggest Mend Bones or your
anti-undead nuke (vs. undead) for this slot.

    Eeew. I always kept Leach in, and always made sure that if I was
fighting then Leach was on me. It's a good DoT to pull with as much of the
benefit (the healing to you) happens whether the mob is running or not, as
opposed to the 2/3rds damage thing with DoTs you want to damage a target. It
also seems to have Lifetap-like resists at lower level, so you won't ever
have it bounce on anything you're likely to pull. It's good when setting a
mob up for the kill that one part of your strategy is accomplished.

    That seems like a lot of DoT power on one mob. I remember stacking three
DoTs at level 16, but that was when one was being used for long-distance
pulls and when my pet would be tanking two mobs until I was done DoTting and
moved into melee. Experiment with a lighter load - Poison Bolt is good as
it's quick-acting, and Heat Blood does strong damage. Unless you need
darkness line to stop running, try and skip that one - and if you are using
it as a snare, Clinging Darkness is good enough. When you start fear kiting
you'll be using Darkness, Leach, biggest DoT standard, but that's more
because of the 2/3rds damage thing.

    Use Lifetap for that. Gets the points back now so you can wade back in,
and can also start the mob running now. You remember nuking theory with your
WIZ, it's quite similar.

    I always thought of Dark Pact as more like a clarity or breeze - you
don't go non-stop, but you do have vastly reduced sitting time. As you level
up and start getting a significant amount of mana per tick relative to your
pool again, it'll become non-stop.
