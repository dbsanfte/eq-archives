Has anyone else noticed an increased difficulty in targeting?.  While on 
the Stormwave (which I camp often), I can no longer target the mob next 
to the mast and the one next to the captains spawn point.  I cannot 
target tham until I get aggro by getting too close.  Also occasionally 
have difficulty paying the bazaar crack whores.  I have to change the 
angle from which I'm trying to give them payment several times before i 
get the "give" screen.  was just wondering if anyone else has 
experienced this.  Thanks
