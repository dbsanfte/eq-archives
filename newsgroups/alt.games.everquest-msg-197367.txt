given a suitably broad definition of trivial, yup. A low 60s, high DPS
group could easily get through the trials. Note that we're talking
about Exe here, the other trials are less dependent on DPS but you
face tougher mobs while still needing to kill them quick so you don't
get hit by respawns. The one trial that I don't think is time based is
fire, but it's also the ones that the uberguilds have the most trouble
with.

Because too many of my friends lvl way too slowly for that. Casual
gamers that are just now hitting 60. When they log on I'm forced to
choose between not grouping with them or going somewhere trivial
because they aren't flagged. The fact that you consider this a good
idea doesn't mean I have to like it. I actually did stay 61st lvl
until just recently so friends could catch up, but even though they
eased things a lot as far as the other flag requirements go (CoD, BoT,
HoH, etc.) it's still a pain when someone shows up that's been missing
for a while and suddenly can't go where the rest of us do.

Maybe if you actually listened to what others are saying instead of
answering your own questions, you just might learn something. The fact
that most of the people saying that you're clueless in this regard
actually are flagged should tell you something. BTW, add me to that
list.
