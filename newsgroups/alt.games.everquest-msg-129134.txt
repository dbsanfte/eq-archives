Good points AEQ3.

Now, about this occupation thing.

If you could disprove this notion, then that pretty much wraps up the
pro-Palestinian argument that they NEED to do suicide bombings b/c that is
their only resource to use b/c they are "illegally" occupied.

When the West Bank was part of  Jordan (after they annexed it in 1948 as
part of the attack on Israel), from that point to the point where Israel
took it back (1967), there was no protest or homicide bombings by the
Palestinians then, even though Jordan slaughtered them and eventually kicked
them out of Jordan. No declaration that there needed to be a Palestinian
state, etc. Why not then, and why now? Hmmmm....

Conclusion: It isn't the land, or "occupation" that makes Palestinians
embark on homicide bombings. It is the fact that now Israel holds that land,
rather than a fellow Arab country (even one that slaughtered thousands of
Palestinians).

It is anti-semitism pure and simple. And BTW: Those same Palestinians are
represented in the Israeli government, and can vote. Where else are they
represented in the Arab world?
