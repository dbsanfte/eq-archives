At fan faire they said they'll be looking at this issue on collection
adventures, so I'd say not.  If you require people to open those
things then you just about require them to have 1 rogue|bard + 1 int
caster + 1 wis caster in the group.  Doing so would just ensure that
people skip that adventure type, and still emphatically say, "DO NOT
TOUCH ANY BOXES UNTIL WE WIN."
