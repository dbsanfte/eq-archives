No. I've found in my years with computers that games are notoriously
difficult to maintain a player base. How many other 3-year-old games
are you still playing regularly? The only other game I'm still playing
from 3 years ago is Half-Life. StarCraft came and went. Diablo and
Diablo II came and went. Command & Conquer and it's spawn came and
went. But Everquest and Half-Life have stayed with me.

It's true EQ is maturing, and I guess you could say it's in its golden
years compared to the hundreds of other 3-year-old games that have
risen and died, but I don't think Verant/SOE is "juicing" the players
before EQ dies. I think EQ is maturing nicely, and as long as Verant
continues to build decent expansions, I'll remain part of their player
base.

Everything dies eventually, and EQ will also. But if the expansions
make it just as fun to play and just as cutting edge as any new
MMORPGs, it'll be around for a few more years to come.
