Any druid using Snare since they fixed Ensnare should be beaten about
the head and shoulders severely.

Snare = 1.5 minute fixed duration

Ensnare = 10(!) minute fixed duration

Snare might only be 15 mana vs. 35 for ensnare, but if you can see a
difference at level 52 they you're a better man than I.
