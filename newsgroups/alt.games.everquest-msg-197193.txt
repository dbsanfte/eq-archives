i play a moderately well equipped 52 naggy/vox monk (all AA at level 52 for
naggy & vox raids)

i find i frequently outdamage 50-60 warrior tanks and have to feign off to
evade aggro.  However, i have NEVER had to feign off a shadowknight tank in
that level range.  something about clinging darkness that really peeohs the
mob :=)

i have regular SK and Warr friends i play with in level range.
