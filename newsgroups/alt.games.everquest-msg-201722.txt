I think every human monk in the game ends up owning a Tranix crown at some
point.

In planning ahead, don't pay too much attention to your current AC,
particularly planning that far ahead.  You'll have other items that change
and bump you above 1k by 61 (hopefully...).

When you do get to 60+ another option opens to you.  The ornate
("enlightenment") armor has some nice pieces.  The AC is pretty bad on all
the pieces, but legs was the one piece that was actually an AC upgrade for
me (the other stats and effects are all nice upgrades worth taking the AC
hit for generally).

You still might be surprised.  Some weapons seem to proc considerably more
than others.  I got a katar some time back with a lifetap proc that I
thought would be awesome to solo with (was using tranquil staff at the
time).  It never procced enough to make it worth using.

Tstaff procs quite a bit compared to most other proccing weapons I've used. 
Believe me, the damage of the weapon is great, but the proc is what really
sets it out above competitors.
