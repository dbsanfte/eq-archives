Oh, you got extremely lucky.  There's definitely a rare spawn cycle in SRo,
and *if* the AC is on that, he's something like a 1/100 chance.  People
doing the rare cycle, like you seem to have been doing, usually have to
spend a long time at it.

I don't remember what the placeholders are for Hasten, but I don't think
they are the regular drakes.  They are either something else, or if they are
drakes, they have name variations that make them stand out on
Show^H^H^H^Htracking.

You definitely did this backwards: virtually everyone else finds getting the
AC to be the long hard part, and getting the Shadowed Men drop and Hasten
are just minor inconveniences after that. :-)
