Diet Pepsi Jazz - Black Cherry/French Vanilla (yes, both in same beverage)

I'm not a Pepsi drinker, but I like Dr. Pepper well enough. That's the 
closest flavor I can think of with which to compare it. It tastes almost 
like a dessert, and they've managed to disguise that bitter diet soda 
aftertaste somewhat - or at least made it harder to pick out of that 
variety of different flavors. :P

Definitely different.
