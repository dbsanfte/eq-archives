Thanks Lokari. :)

You will find I tend to downplay female skill and intelligence...
am I doing this in sarcasm? Only my hairdresser knows... *snicker*
I don't really mean to cast a bad light on the fairer sex.   One of my
favorite lines is... "my .01 female opinion"... reason for the ONE instead
of TWO cents-I tend to be so vociferous with my opinions, were I to value
them at .02 they would quickly overrun and undervalue male opinions, due to
sheer volume. LOL.

:)
I am still wondering what would be 'missing' from the 10 dollar version of
the CD's as opposed to the, say 30 dollar version?

It sounds very involved, but she LOVES fantasy, reading fantasy books and
playing fantasy RPG. I think she will be very happy with EQ.

Thanks for the info.
