I have been running some tests on giving pets AC Items (Phantom Plate Armor)
my pets do take less damage when equip with the plate armor. But I am still
in a testing phase. Weapons will only do more damage if the damage of the
weapons exceeds that of the natural damage of the pet. Delay on weapons no
longer have an effect of the pets delay anymore. Also Weapons that proc
(Velium stuff) will help if the pet is a high enough level.
