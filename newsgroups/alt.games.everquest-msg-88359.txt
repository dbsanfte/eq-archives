This is my first ever post to an Everquest Newsgroup.

I ordered everquest yesterday from www.chipsbits.com. They have the
EverQuest Mini Box W98 CD for $7.95. I was thinking of getting the trillogy
but I decided to get the base game first to see  how I like it. I have
played Asheron's Call and Ultima Online: Third Dawn. But I eventually got
bored with both.  A friend at work has been telling me his wife bought the
trillogy and they seem to love it.

AnywayI was wondering about Windows XP. I have a Win XP system ( Pentium III
500 MHz, 320 MB RAM, ATI 32 MB All in wonder 128 video card, 60 GB
HardDrive ).  How does Everquest get along with Windows XP Professinal?


I am assumming when you first connect to the net you download a bunch of
patches?


What are your thoughts on the basic game I ordered VS the upgrades?

How important are they?
