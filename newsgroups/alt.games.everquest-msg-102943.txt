Too bad most reporters out there won't bother taking that seriously, as it
won't hype the frenzy of the people out there.

Of late, it seems reporters are more interested in the odd facts and
capitalizing on it than the full facts of the issue.

A good example is the fact that about 90% of the entertainment industry
puts out stuff of questionable nature for a select group of people.  It
only takes about 5 minutes for a person to look over a package and decide
if they should buy or not buy, and it also takes about that long for an
adult of morale responsibility to decide if it is appropriate for a younger
audience.

But of recent, it seems that the American Public, or at least, the last few
generation of parents, have taken less of an active interest in their
children's activites or at least socialization with their children.  Not
all parents, just the ones with the problem children.  As Rumble here has
pointed out, he is a father, with a good job and a wife, yet the media
likes to focus on the people who lost their job, had a failed relationship,
or had something 'horrific' happen due to a game.

I am sure there are more people just like Rumble, a parent with kids and a
steady job, who also play this game and many others.  None of them having
problems, but of course, the media doesn't mention this, because it doesn't
stir up the frenzy or make people notice, because it is commonplace.  The
media of recent is more interested in grabbing your attention and creating
the wrong kind of frenzy over the stupidiest things.

This is why are current society is being laughed at, is how easy our people
are manipulated by the media into acting like the smallest things are the
sole reason a person did something 'out of the norm'.  A shame there is
never a reasonable 'followup' to their stories, and the most vocal, and
often times, most uninformed people, are heard more clearly than the
calmer, more informed people.
