Well, as for the drinking, never get drunk in real life and then try
to ride the boat.  The edge is a lot closer than it seems.  I ended up
falling off the boat, getting on an island full of water goblins, die
by the hands of the water goblins.  I then decided to go after the
corpse, so get back on the ship, jump off, avoid the goblins, luckily
locate the corpse that landed in the water using /cor.  Just start
swiming in one direction until I finaly happen across an island where
the boat stops.  The entire time my roommate was telling me that there
is no chance in hell that I'm going to be able to recover that corpse
and then get onto a boat without drowning, all while drunk.

 ...although, being drunk in game and in real life at the same time is
a rather interesting experience.
