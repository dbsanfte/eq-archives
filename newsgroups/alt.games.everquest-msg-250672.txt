   You've already gotten your answer.  I would suggest that you might have
your son read the FAQ for this newsgroup, which you can find in my sig.

    I suppose if you really want to teach your son that cheating is the way
to get ahead, you can just reach into your wallet and buy him some plat. 
Good luck with that.
