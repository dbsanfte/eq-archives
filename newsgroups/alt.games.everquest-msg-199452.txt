I think that you have access to a map, they added maps of newbie zones 
to the interface.  Press <backspace> in game to see if it comes up
If you have LoY expansion (it's a download) you can get maps for other 
areas at <maps.eq-toolbox.com>.  I recommend getting the full zip file 
from there.
you might also want to check out <everquest.allakhazam.com>, 
<eqtraders.com/quests/quests.htm> (look up your race and class for a 
nice newbie armor quest), <eq.castersrealm.com> for info on all classes.

Have fun
