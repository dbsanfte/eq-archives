Good point.  I bought my nephew an EQ account as a gift.  It's
currently billed in my name, of course.  If he eventually takes
over the monthly payments, the billing will change to a different
name, different credit card, different address, and different
*country* (he's Canadian).

And yet, he's the only person to ever have played from that
account, and there'd be hell to pay if Verant presumed that
the switch was "proof" of an account sale.
