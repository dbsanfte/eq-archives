I'd go so far as to say that if Germany had won the war, he would be
seen as a hero now and the US would be seen as the great villians for
droping the big bombs on Japan... Oh, and, hey, betcha didn't know
about the "camps" the US sent our Japanese-Americans to...

The point is, evil is perspective. As such, is there really any such
thing as "true evil", or just what society tells us is evil?
