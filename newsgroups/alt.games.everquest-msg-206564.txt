Ah I might see what they're trying to see. They use Frenzy as in sticking to
you instead of your pet. Undead have weird aggro at times, mostly ignoring
hatelists and attacking the closest target, but once you get high enough on
the hate list they do go for you.

What they mean here is that you have to take care that he sticks to your pet
and not attack you. For the low health note in that text... well any monster
goes after you when you get low hp. He aparently comes for you when you hit
2 bubs which is a bit soonish compared to most other mobs who do that at 1
bub or even lower.
