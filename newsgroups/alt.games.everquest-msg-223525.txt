Some of tier 3 is accessible based on level, but consists of Bastion of 
Thunder, and Halls of Honor, as well as two or three that are only flag 
accessible, Plane of Tactics, and Plane of Torment.  I may have missed

Elemental planes are tier 4 maybe, not sure, have not really paid too 
much attention as they are out of reach for now.
