EQ will be around for several years to come.  If you think soulscream belts
or uber shit then you are showing your lack of high level gaming in EQ.
Last summer our guild camped the Rotting Shopkeeper in veksar for a few days
off and on until we all had that belt.  No biggie for a good grp of mid 50s.
As someone else posted in this thread said, those who can take down these
fabled mobs already have better in most cases.  These mobs hit for between
750-1200 points a shot.  These are trophies for higher levels to have.
Nothing more.  The Fabled Jboots being the one exception.  Instead of the
gimped sow that normal jboots cast these cast a true sow.  I do think SOE
will have some hard decisions to make down the road.  Several of the older
servers have had their populations drop badly IMO.   I came back to the game
after a nine month layoff and I am enjoying the experience of playing on
Stromm and being a member of the guild I am in.  The community on stromm is
very much alive and enthused about the game.
