What's the cheapest way to get smithing past 188?

I went for plate simply because I could get padding for cheap (being a
druid, hunting spiders in feerott before the silk nerf, and the bazaar
wasn't interested in padding much, currently it's selling for around 34-35
on rodcet nife)

Harvesting combine temper seems insanely hard unless you are tough enough
not to attract aggro from sonic wolves etc in ten. mountains. I'm not 8-]
