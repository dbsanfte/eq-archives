Last reply, then I kill file you.....

3 Expansion boxes worth of new zones...Kunark, Velious, Luclin, PoP,
and now LoY (which is not really an expansion).

Expansions (with new zones) = Less crowding

Less crowding != fewer players

In the last 18months (I assume you are smart enough to do the
math...2-3 years = 24-36 months ago) Sony has announced that EQ has
hit more than 400K+ subscriptions and more than 100K online at the
same time. 

I don't need perception when the facts are that obvious.


Your claim that fewer people are playing today than 2-3 years ago is
one of the stupidest things I have ever read in this newsgroup.

EQ isn't dying. 

Has it peaked? Most likely. 

Will it gradually decline until something better comes along that
takes a large bite out of the player base? (SWG, EQ2, ?) Perhaps, but
so far none of the other MMPORPGs have taken such a "bite".
