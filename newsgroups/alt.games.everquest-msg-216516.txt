The dungeon is instanced based on the average level of your party. The game
does not adjust for the availability of crowd control, and it does not
adjust for the number of players in the party. A group of five will get the
same dungeon as a group of four or six, if levels are about the same.

There's a thread about how this is all calculated happening elsewhere in the
group at the moment.

Besides, if you seriously couldn't pull without getting 5 or 6 - either your
cleric or your puller was an idiot. Pacify is a level 39 spell, works fine
indoors, rarely resists, and any cleric who knows their business will have
it memmed in a group where no other CC is available. It's better to waste 7
seconds on a pacify than a couple of minutes having the healers med their
mana back because they were trying to heal 3 melees vs. 5 MOBs.

If they can afford it the cleric should get the Donal's bracer, which gives
clicky pacify. Pacify caps at level 55, but for your group you should be
getting MOBs well under the level cap. (At level 65 the MOBs are too high
for
Pacify and you have to use Pacification - which *can* be a serious mana
drain, but at 65 mana regen is much better.)

Plus if the cleric knows their business, they will be waiting for MOB to be
ready to drop and the next pull will already be pacified, so no time wasted.

Yes, the domain is sad, but effective. :-)
