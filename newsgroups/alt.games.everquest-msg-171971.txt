 Exactly. The trackball doesn't move and I can hit the left mouse button
with my right pinky finger without having to worry about where I left the
pointer. Granted, this is usually done over the pet window with my necro,
haven't played a bard or needed to hot swap equipment slots yet but this
is a really good alternative to a roll-around-on-the-desk model. I use one
at work and at home on eq.
