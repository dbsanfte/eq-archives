Cable just came into our area, but it's Adelphia, and I have DirecTV.  Since
I get local channels on satellite, and DirecTV is the only player for NFL
Sunday Ticket, I don't have Cable TV hooked up.  Adelphia gives preferential
pricing for cable customers, so I will stick with my DSL.  Most newer DSL is
not dialup.  I have a full time DSL modem and a Linksys router for my
network.  The performance is plenty sufficient for EQ.

As mentioned elsewhere, DSL performance is based entirely on distance from
substation and account limit (you will never get higher performance than
they say is tops for the account, but you will likely get less because you
are not at the substation).  Vendors will not sell you an account if you
don't meet the minimum standard distance.  Cable, and other group methods,
are based entirely on total network bandwidth vs. the number of users.  When
I had Sprint wireless in Colorado Springs, my first day I got 8 MEGAbits.
After they had saturated the network, I averaged 350 KILObits.  Here at
work, I get 5Mb.  Not sure what I'm getting on DSL, but IIRC, its around
400-500Kb.

Cheers,
Eric
