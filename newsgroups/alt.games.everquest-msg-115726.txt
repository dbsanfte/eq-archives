Apparently reading comprehension is not your strong suit sir, "I also play
my friend's 52 warrior at times."

It just isn't hard to know how to use /assist and when to off-tank
something, I would however suck as a monk or rogue, but I've never gotten a
monk or rogue over level 7, so there.

What can warriors do on a raid?  tank, extra melee damage, off-tank adds,
run like hell, and die
What can druids do on a raid?  evac, heal, resist buff, nuke, resist debuff,
snare, harmony (some raids anyways), damage shield, ghetto CC with root
(depends on the raid), port people to the raid, port people out, run like
hell, and die.
