From my personal experience, using a 26.4k dial up connection exclusively, I
would have to say that the computer makes by far the biggest difference in
playing EQ, not the connection, so long as it's a reasonably stable
connection.  I kept the same video card, the same modem, and the same sound
card, upgraded from a pentium 200Mhz MMX with 64mb, running Win95 to a
PIII-800MHz with 256MB running Win2k.  My zone times went down drastically.
My video card is an old Voodoo, so Kunark zones with lots of trees still
suck.  The reason I want a broadband connection is to improve my download
time of patches for EQ, and music.
