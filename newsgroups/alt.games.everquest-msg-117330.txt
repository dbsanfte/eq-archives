I would say that it is stored as long as the zone (and the server
itself is up). 

My guess is that Quest NPCs work like Vendor NPCs. 

They hang onto whatever items are sold/given to them, and they keep
track of the quantity. Quest NPCs must have some additional logic
added to them so that when you give them the right items (and/or the
right quantity) it triggers the next step in the quest (reward,
additional text, etc). Once the required items are handed in and the
quest is completed (triggered) the Quest NPC "destroys" what was
handed to them by resetting a counter.

From a programming standpoint the sharing of code (routines) between
Vendors and Quest NPCs makes a lot of sense, because they handle items
in a similar fashion if you look at it from a "nuts and bolts"
perspective.
