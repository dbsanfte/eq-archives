Wurmslayer: http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/item.html?item=355
Mace of the Shadowed Soul: http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/item.html?item=2664

The wurmslayer is 24/40.  It's dam/del ratio is: .625
The MoSS is: 19/29.  Dam/del ratio is: .655

So, the dam/del ratio on the moss is better than the slayer.

Also, the slayer weighs 15, while the moss is 2.6, which means your fatigue
bar doesnt just disapear.

The +10 INT on the MoSS is a nice little bonus, since shadow knight's manna
pool is determined by their int.

As for a shield, it depends on what level you are and where you can go, etc.
Though I have found the Shield of Shadows to be easily obtainable (check
out: http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/item.html?item=4159).
