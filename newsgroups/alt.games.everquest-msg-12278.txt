ROFL.  Despite the GM warning I would have loved to see that.  Which reminds
me, I hear of countless people getting killed by the banker in Kelethin.  Do
the merchants of Kelethin have a faction?  I have spent the vast majority of
my life in GFay and CB killing orcs and while I am an ally to the guards and
so on there I am still indifferent to the merchants.  Had a necro once ask
how he could raise faction with the merchants so they wouldn't woop him (he
already killed orcs etc. to raise faction with guards)- must be tough being
KOS to the merchants of a town and not to the guards of the same place!  Now
THAT has to be toughest faction tom raise - where there is NO FACTION
(unless I am wrong here?)
