One of my mother's cats is quite a gourmet, to an scary degree. Before she 
went vegetarian, she would buy sometimes buy some nice ham for herself, and 
a slightly cheaper (but still meant for human consumption) cut for the cat. 
The cat would happily eat his portion, but if presented with bits of both, 
the bugger could tell *always* which one was the more expensive one and eat 
that instead.

there are a couple of cat/spider puns woven around the fact.
