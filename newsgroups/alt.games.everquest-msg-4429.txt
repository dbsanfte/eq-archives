Sounds to me like you're doing things right.  Since casters have fewer hit points your best bet is to get them before they get you.  In a few levels you will have better burns, but then the mobs will get tougher too.  It might help a bit to put thorns on and get in and
melee too.  

Another possibility would be to DOT and root them, then run out of range.

You could also charm an animal to use as a pet so you don't have to take the damage.  That's risky of course since charm is likely to wear off at the wrong moment, but it can work well.  

Really I find it much easier to partner with someone who can do good damage or stun or fear them to prevent casting.
