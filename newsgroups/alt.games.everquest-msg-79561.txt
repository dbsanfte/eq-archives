Dstep never at any time said that it was point for point.

If you want to prove or disprove it you have to do enough healing that
the mob *switches targets* to the healer.

If the mob doesn't switch targets, the cleric did not get more aggro
than the warrior and therefore, acc. to Dstep's hypothesis, would not
get exp.

I have never tested this myself to see which is true though. Just make
sure in your tests the healer gains the aggro or you're not testing
anything.
