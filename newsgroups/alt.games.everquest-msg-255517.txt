Ive played Daoc for 3 years. I was in european open beta.
Daoc is a fun game to played. While eq is based more on pve daoc
really evolves around pvp when you reach lvl 50. There are 3 realms
which is at constant war. There are castle sieges and large battles.
Rams and trebuchets are used in siege. Tanks hammer door archers
fire arrows that do large damage and mages function as artillery.
Its very fun to play. The way to get to lvl 50 can be long depending
on class you play. Necro is a fast solo lvler but not very popular in
pvp.
There is one bad thing with daoc. Some people buy a second account and
get a buffbot. The buffbot makes them very powerful in pvp. If you are
a stealther its allmost neccecary to have a buffbot to compete.
Else I can say that in group group composition is most important,
having damage dealers, crowd control and healers in same group is
great.
Overall daoc is a fun game and a bit different than eq , eq is pve
based and excels in that area.
