Just an observation, but shouldn't GetsumJ have written "YOU'RE water 
people"?<capitalisation and emphasis mine>  I mean, he proclaims to be my 
better, and yet *I* know the difference between the contraction "you're" 
(meaning you are) and "your", a possesive.

As I said, just an observation.  That, and he needs to use punctuation 
appropriately (sp?).  WOW!  I responded to Rumbledor, not doofus - i mean 
Getsumj!
