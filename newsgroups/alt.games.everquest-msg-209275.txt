Interesting.  I haven't noticed a root break between ticks 1 and
5 playing two Druids (one to 37, current main is 49).  But I also
haven't fought any high MR mobs.  Hmm, could maybe test it by
charming a high blue and buffing its MR (might not even have to
bother deliberately breaking charm after that, heh), then see if
I can get the buffed ex-pet to break root at the "wrong" time.

As for the pet apparantly breaking root on engagement, I have
mostly avoided using charmed pets with my Druid, and my BL does
not have root, so I have no experience to speak of sending pets
against rooted mobs.  I've seen odder things in the game tho,
so I'm sure not gonna deny the possibility outright.  I will say
that I never saw anything comparable when my Paladin engaged
rooted mobs, but there's definitely some wierdness with pets.
An unrelated(?) bit of pet wierdness I saw last night: I sent my
BL's pet after a mob that was some distance away (well outside
agro range), the pet taunted immediately and the mob then made a
beeline for it, meeting it halfway.  The wierdness here (to me at
least) is because PC Taunt skill is very short range, shorter
than weapon melee.
