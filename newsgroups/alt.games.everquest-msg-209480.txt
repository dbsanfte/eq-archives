<<<: As we all well know Sony as been getting money since Everquest first
: launched and are rakeing in millions every month, but they have yet to do
: anything worth while with their money that they have "STOLEN" from us. Why
: continue to give them money if they dont use it to evolve the game? Insted
: they are using  your money to pay for their subscription to porn sites. So
: they can all be happen and have a circle jerk in the office while playing EQ
: and doing what they call "Customer support". This has to come to an end.
: RIGHTNOW!>>>

You lack the talent necessary to play this game.
