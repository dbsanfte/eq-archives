This last is silly.  If you have 4 groups but have only three clerics, adding a
fifth group with a cleric in it isn't going to solve anything.  If you need
someone and want to keep the total people to a certain level, then you get that
someone while keeping your count under the target.

While this is all sweetness and light, there are mobs in the game that  cannot
be killed by your guild's plan.. even if you are all level 60 with 200 AA
points.  Why?  Because enough people to do the job without planning out a
balanced cohesive approach will be so many that they will lag out to the point
where the approach can't work.

Assuming you aren't all 60 with 200 AA, then there are mobs you still can't
kill, that a guild with similarly leveled people can, for the same reasons.

In theory, you can overcome a bad mix of classes with sheer numbers. From a
practical standpoint, this will allow you to kill mobs that others can kill with
one group if you bring two, two groups you bring 4, 4 groups you bring 8... but
what about those mobs that require 8 groups in a best possible approach
situation?  You really can't expect to field 16 groups and have that work out.

Further, if a mob can be killed by a single group, but takes you two groups,
then you have essentially cut the loot and exp you are getting off the mob in
half.

None of this requires that you change your style of play, you just have to
recognize that if you play your way, you are never going to be able to see some
of the content verant put in the game. What brings this all up, though, is your
statement that "I think Verant's idea is that guilds are supposed to be like the
one I'm in (Scions of Veeshan, The Nameless).  "

If guilds are supposed to work that way, then there are mobs in the game that
are never supposed to be killable.  While I suppose thats a possibility, I
wonder why they put a loot table on them at all in that case (and I  know, there
were a couple where they didn't...)

Personally, I'd rather see people included because they are needed, rather than
begrudgingly allowed along because you don't want to be leaving them out since
they are nice chaps.  Mages graduated from "ick" to "needed" with the advent of
mod2.  Pet changes make removal of Mod 2 less harsh than a demotion to "ick" but
in most cases, it still demotes the class to "another damage dealer" status.
You'll no longer hear "well, we'll have to postpone the raid till MageX logs on"
