There is no in-game function for this to my knowlege. The group leader
(or a person he/she designates) will just keep a piece of scrap paper
and take names down. If you're extremely lucky, they may just stick to
the order that people sign up and send you a /tell when you're name is
at the top. (You'd better be close by, or they'll just drop you. I used
to go hunt in the jail cell areas upstairs while I waited, or just work
on tradeskills by the bank.) 

However, in most cases, keep in mind that if somebody applies after you
who is either a.) a friend of the GL, friend of a group member or, b.) a
class they are short on and seen as more desirable than your own
class...
Well, you may have a wait.
