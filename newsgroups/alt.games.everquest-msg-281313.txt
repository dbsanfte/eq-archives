Actually its one character tagged per year.
So if you have the first two veteran rewards you can tag 2 characters...=20
if you prepaid next year you qualified for an 'extra' level, so if you=20
did that *and* have been playing since the beginning you can tag a=20
maximum of 6 chars.

Next anniversary that will roll over to 7... etc
