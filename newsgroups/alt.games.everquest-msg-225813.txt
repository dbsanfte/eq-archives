I don't know what's wrong with me, I'm actually getting excited about the
next EQ expansion!  Maybe it's just the lure of new character models.  I
can only hope they learned from luclin and will no longer give me skinny
legs and a flat butt.  Since these graphics are intended to be lower
resource hogs than luclin, and possibly even lower hogs than old-world
grahpics, we may get to see varied armor graphics again.  Perhaps they'll
even do the shocking thing and force everyone to use these low-resource
grpahics, so we all look the same to each other again!  Dressing for
fashion in EQ these days is like designing a web page...you hope it looks
equally good on Netscape, IE, mozilla, and opera, but you know better.

But no...I think it's more than just the fashion monkey in me.  I'm
excited about a new continent to explore.  A NEW WORLD!  For the first
time in my EQ experience I'm at the top of my own personal game, and I'm
I'm getting to the point where I will have explored all of the places that
matter to me (ie, everything but high end raid zones).  So a new world
will be just the sort of thing I'll be ready for. I get to be at the front
of the pack for once, instead of waiting 6 months until the content is
already spoiled and known.

I haven't felt this since Luclin was announced.  

Course, I'm pretty sure that they'll do something DASTARDLY to shamans,
thus sending my partner into a furious rage, and ending in us quitting
EQ...right after Foxeye finally got to look the way I want her to.  /sigh

But for now, I'll be excited.  Yup yup!
