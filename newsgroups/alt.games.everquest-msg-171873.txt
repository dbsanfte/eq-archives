I personally have never seen that happening.  I have a number of twinks that
I have played off and on, both before, and after KEI became available.  None
of my casters have ever been asked if they have KEI, I have never
vollunteered that information when LFG.  I have never been booted from a
group, or booted/refused to grab someone based on whether or not they have
KEI.  Maybe it does happen sometimes, but, it just doesn't seem common
enough to be an issue.
