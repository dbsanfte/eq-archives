I keep CH, celestial, remedy and word of vigor in my 7,8,9 and 0 
hotkeys. Ch my tanks, with a Donals BP as a drop dead top off to save 
mana after a pull if the mob dies before the regular CH cooks off and i 
can duck out of it, unless it is a small amount, then i use remedy as it 
has the smallest mana burden. my MAs get a celestial and if they get to 
50% health i will drop a fast remedy on them. My robewearers get a 
celestial at 75%, if they are taking agro too much, i will hit them with 
a fast remedy. word is good for a group top off if there is a trap 
triggered.


complete heal - single, 400 mana, 7500 hp
celestial - single, 255 mana, 180 hp/tick
remedy - single, 175 nama, 433-488 hp
word of vigor - group, 750 mana, 590 hp at 52nd level

Other spells i load - cure disease, cure poison. i intend to finsh the 
pure blood quest in LoY, but i just need to find the time...I also will 
load temperence and blessing of faith if asked, and usually have a root 
and a stun memmed. I have a donals bracer with pacify and if needed i 
have the ae pacify.
