No, no one will assist as long as you're not dumb and AE or something.

I've pulled them both all the way out into the courtyard.  That seemed best
as there's a lot of room to run around in.

Cleric guy heals, kill him first.  (Forget which one is which, alas)

I did the final turn-in with three mages and a necro all in their high 50's,
so it was petmania on the two mobs.  They both went down easy.

The final battle is really very easy.  I betcha a coupla 65's could do it no
problem.
