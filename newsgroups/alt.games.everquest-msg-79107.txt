Ok, so the guy probably did have a good reason to kill the guards, and I
have to admit that if he was killing guards in the *real* newbie area,
instead of a lowbie area, I probably would have been madder. Although I
didn't stand around long enough to watch to see if he was helping others out
or not, and that's abbout the 4th thing on my "I shoulda" list.
