Actually, you can't buy it from them.  It brings up a page that gives a
little info and has links to distributers like Best Buy or EB Games.

Hitting the button may be the best way to get rid of the add.  After I did
that, the window didn't pop up again, and I can't see any way they had to
tell if I had ordered or not, just whether I had viewed the page.
