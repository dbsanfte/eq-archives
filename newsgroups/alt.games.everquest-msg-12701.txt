How is this a moral dilemma, if you sold them after he told you to? The
worst thing you did, really, was sell them to a vendor. If you got 128pp
from the vendor, they were probably worth about 500-1kpp each. Given
that, I doubt you're feeling as bad as you thought about this whole
moral thing, are you? =)
