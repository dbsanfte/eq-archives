I was going to say.  LoL the image of a Necro getting
to level 7 without ever casting a pet.

After you have a pet, you need to know how to command it.

Here are a few -

/pet kill           will make him attack your target
/pet back off       will make him stop attacking
/pet follow me      will make him follow you around
/pet sit down       will make him stop (and collapse
                  in a pile of bones)
/pet guard here     similar to /pet sit down with the
                  exception that /pet guard here will
                  make him return to the guard spot after
                  a fight, /pet sit down will make him 
                  just collapse anywhere after a fight.
/pet report health  will make the pet tell you what percent
                  of his health he has left, and any spells
                  that are on him.

Things to note:

Pets will automatically attack anything that attacks you.

You have to do at least 1 point of damage to the mob, or
your pet will steal 75% of the xp.

Nothing will attack your pet when it walks by, even something
that would attack you - so long as you are out of the mob's
aggro range.

You should hot key many of your pet commands (have
kill, health, follow, guard and back off hotkeyed at all times)
