No - unfortunately the country specific warnings are updated which
overwrites the previous version. They have no "history" of what they were at
different dates that I could find.

Not that I recall and Bali is my centre of interest in Indonesia. I think I
would have noticed that. I am going purely off memory of what the site
*used* to be though and everyone in this NG knows the state of my brain.

No. The Indonesian one is the only one I regulary read though as my mother
is a "bali-phile". She speaks Bahasia Indonesian and is learning Sanskrit
and it's Balinese offshoot Kawi. I am the one who keeps her web page updated
and help out their Uni club technically, so I do regularly drop by the DFAT
web page, but again - I am running purely off memory for previous versions
of the page which of course is as good as useless.

You got me there - I never consciously noted they had made an exception of
Bali.

There is a political reason for that I suspect - our Government *still* even
now maintains our support of current US policy has no bearing on the risk to
Australians here and abroad . On the 11th Oct DFAT just quoted the US
warning wholesale which of course was aimed at US citizens and interests.
For DFAT to then issue a similar statement for Aussies would be too close to
them recognising the Gov's staunch support of US policy does in fact reflect
on us.

Expecting politicians to be anything other than political is just wishful
thinking unfortunately, hence policy and reality are two very different
animals indeed.
