I use mine for killing the ensnared runners, not that theres much use for
that where I quad (the mobs dont flee). Even light blues will annihilite the
pet in no time. They are ok for farming silk in EK, tho they do take about
1/3 damage from a crag spider. Again, useless for me since I have a necro or
an enchanter with much bigger meaner pets.
You also cant make the bear dual wield.
