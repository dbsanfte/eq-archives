I am a Tierdal, and a "business woman", and I was planning a good old
time on Morell-Thule killing Lady Shae. I knew she had only felguard
faction, and she is probably the only thing on that faction. I found
that she hated me when I went on a trip to the Hogcallers Inn in
Freeport. Since I enjoy a good joke, unlike those Innoruk guys, and I
don't see any reason I shouldn't show everyone a good time, by
Bristlebane, I thought it would be funny to kill her.

I got her twice, but I caused an uproar in Freeport. Sure she was
there and minding her own business, but the guards didn't care. If
they don't care why should anyone else? I didn't cause any trains,
just upset the Pale (High) elves in the zone. They hate me anyway.

All those pale people were upset, heck, I guess they didn't think it
was funny. At least they don't scowl all the time like the people back
in Neriak do.

Does anyone have something to suggest so I can murder, I mean hunt,
Lady Shae without causing an uproar? I did shout "Lady Shae to newbie
area!" and pulled her to the side away from everyone else.
