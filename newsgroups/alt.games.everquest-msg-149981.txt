In other words "you are not a critical team member.  It is
your job to help kill things without getting aggro.  If you
get aggro, you will get a heal eventually, unless you are
dead, in which case you will get a rez and then a heal.  And
people will look at you funny.  If it happens regularly, you
will recieve a one way ticket to any TL zone of our choice."

Don't feel bad, its exactly the same treatment that anyone but
the mezer, MT, puller, and cleric get.  And of those, the mezer
and cleric are going to get the hairy eyeball for sucking up
heals and the puller is being healed only when convenient... just
noone complains about it being a waste of mana.

If there is indeed some reason that a mage has to do this, then
he should have a healer provided for him.  Personally, I've
never seen it happen.

Mages get heals because they are a mana source, but for this
to work, they have to be good and careful, and shouldn't be
relying on a hope that someone will notice or consider them
a priority heal... they should know exactly where, when, and
for how much that heal is going to consist of.  If its a 60
shaman, perhaps you are looking at torpor style heals.  If its a
cleric, you might be looking at CHeal or a celestial style heal.  If
its a druid or lower level shaman, the heals are going to be small
and you can stay nearly capped out on health the whole time.

When low on HP for any reason... dont' SIT.  How hard is that
one to figure out?
