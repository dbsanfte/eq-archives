Once upon a time I bought EQ. Mostly because my roomie restarted playing 
it, and we thought it would be some great fun. He had chars and some 
friends on Rodcet, therefore I settled there too.

However I am a CET (GMT+1) eurotrash guy and the server is US based.

Despite having my main in one of the biggest guild on Rodcet, 99% of all 
raids are late night or early early morning for me (2-6AM CET/8-10PM EST), 
and when on in my daytime, the guild is a sleep with only a few ppl and 
some mules on.

Usually when I am keen to play (12-10pm CET) Rodcet is more or less a 
sleep. There are ppl on and some lfg, but usually I can sit LFGing for 3 
hours and still get no grouping. For me, life on Rodcet begins from 10pm.

If I in future get a job, I can really see my chars will struggle unless 
they can solo big time, so I was thinking of transferring my chars to a 
more local server.

That is where you guys comes in, any suggestions to which server, am kinda 
keen on Antonious Bayle which UK server, right?
I am a CET based guy, doing his EQ work from 12-10pm CET. Are the Euro 
servers busy in that timeframe, is it possible to get groups and not having 
to spend 3-4 hours waiting? And which euro server is most populated.
