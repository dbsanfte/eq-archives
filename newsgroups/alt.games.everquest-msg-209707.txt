Not only that but this is just Rev 1 of KoCC - It is a 
direct copy of Garrison's with a change in name and
resist.  A lot of new spells start as copies of existing
spells (all the new curse based dots started as copies
of Tainted Breath) - and assuming that they will keep
those stats is idiotic.  U.N. complaining about the damage
and ratio on this spell is like a shaman complaining about
how shitty the curse spells were when they first showed
up.  And just like U.N. they would have been looking extremely 
stupid when the release version is markedly different
from the initial entry.
