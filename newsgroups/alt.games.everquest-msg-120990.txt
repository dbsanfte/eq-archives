    Actually, I was saying that you'd switch to it as a consequence of
maxing out INT. Which you will do quickly enough once you start adding on
items like thurg quest gear.

    AoE's. Resists only help so much against dragons.

    It's slightly more diversified, as it has MANA in place of INT. You can
never start diversifying too soon, because it doesn't take many drops to
suddenly raise your INT to near cap. Ask your guild casters how high their
INT is to see how easy it is, much easier than for a WIS caster. My two baby
pure INT casters are both over 190 INT, and trust me when I say I don't buy
them anything expensive. (I don't count the ENC, as she's also maxing a
second stat at the same time.)

> Moonstone slightly better, though not much.

    Moonstone has slightly less mana total, but it's totally diversified and
has some of the STR you seem to lack. It's also dirt cheap - I bet you could
buy one for less cash than you'd get selling the INT ring to a vendor.

    So at least my "they consider it junk" comment was right! =) What level
is Tarre now?

    Be careful on them - some of them are ranger/druid casters, and they'll
do stuff like root or snare you. Not good for a kiter.

    Especially now that it's apparently a damage focus. =)

    Ok, which Tarre needs for her eighth shawl. Heck, SOMEONE will want
them!
