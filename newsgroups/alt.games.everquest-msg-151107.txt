    Given the Verant track record on implementing stuff, anyone who wants to
be first to get a new skill has to be off their rocker. Just ask Behemoth in
Fires of Heaven how happy he is that he spent the points on Warcry, and
because of what he found he might be the only warrior with that abomination
of a skill. And it STILL means that people would prefer to have these new
PoP abilities over the existing ones. There's what, 200 to 300 AA levels of
skills one could obtain right now? And people would prefer unknown stuff to
them? Seems to me like there's some combination of too easy to get and
uselessness at work there.

    You've started to put kitty's name and Magelo in your .sig. Have you
finally given up your class nomad ways and found something you're sticking
with? And did they get that problem with your pet's damage output fixed
yesterday? I skipped logging in after seeing half the guild's name at the
top of the EZBoard and seeing one post on our boards saying "LOL EQ is so
scroooood right now, inc. emergency patch".
