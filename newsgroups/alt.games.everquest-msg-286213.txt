I have a level 54 cleric. I know that players in game now have a huge
amount of HPs and a CH sometimes doesn't even heal for half their
HPs!! So my question to you is, which is better wisdom items, high
manna items and is it also important to have good manna regen.

54 cleric with a 3200 manna pool, 220 wisdom.

Could you also suggest some fairly easy to get or inexpensive items
for a non guilded cleric. I don't have a regular group.

Thanks
Zebuxoruk.
