Hi:

Simple question really: Is there a zone which has a Wizard Spire and a bank?
The reason I ask, is that I very often camp, get loot and very encumbered
due to only being able to carry 71 pounds (Gnome) hence I run to the bank
rather frequently. I currently gate to Greater Faydark, run through Lesser
Faydark, then through to Steamfont Mountains (home sweet home) and bank in
Ak'Anon. Whilst this isn't the longest trip by far, it still usually means I
lose my camp more often than not. If I were a Druid I could port straight to
Steamfont and the bank's just a few steps away - any suggestions as to where
I might gate to in order to reach a bank in quickest time?

Many thanks in advance ...

Stevie.

PS: Jazz - if you're reading this - I died yesterday! LOL
