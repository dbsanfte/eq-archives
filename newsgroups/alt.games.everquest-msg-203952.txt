l live in Aus and it is a pain to get a second copy of the full version.
I asked Sony whether l could buy a second key, l was quite prepared
to pay for it just so l didn't have to wait as long for shipping etc and
they said no, l had to buy all the software again.
The really annoying thing is, l have 2 sets of PoP, but l can't use the
second
one as l had already used the key prior to buying the gold edition.
