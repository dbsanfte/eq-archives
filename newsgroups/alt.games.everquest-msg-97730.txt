(I tried to type this in from memory, but failed miserably.
Philosophy is HARD!)

Immanuel Kant was a real pissant
 who was very rarely stable.
Heidegger, Heidegger was a boozy beggar
 who could think you under the table.
David Hume could out consume
 Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel,
 (Other versions: "Shoppenhauer and Hegel")
And Wittgenstein was a beery swine
 who was just as sloshed as Schlegel.

There's nothing Nietzsche couldn't teach ya
 'bout the raisin' of the wrist.
Socrates himself was permanently pissed.

John Stuart Mill, of his own free will,
 on half a pint of shandy was particularly ill.
 (Other versions: "After half a pint...")
Plato, they say, could stick it away,
 'alf a crate of whiskey every day!
Aristotle, Aristotle was a bugger for the bottle,
 and Hobbes was fond of his Dram.
And Rene Descartes was a drunken fart:
 "I drink, therefore I am."

Yes, Socrates himself is particularly missed;
A lovely little thinker, but a bugger when he's pissed.

Watch Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl if you want to actually
hear it. Hell, watch it whether you want to hear it or not, it's an
excellent show. If you like Python, that is.

HTH,
