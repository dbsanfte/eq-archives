/shrug

Faned, are you a part of the open raid crowd? Do you actually know what 
you are talking about here?

The 85/15 mechanic is HEAVILY used (abused?) by open-raiders. Half the 
casuals I know have obtained several of their flags thanks to it. Hell 
I'd be surprised if a PoP open raid has ever been run that didn't 85 a 
good number of people in.

Want to join the TT open raid? Don't have your pre-reqs... no worries 
we'll 85 as many of you in as we can!

These days its easier to get flagged by haphazardly joining as many open 
raids as you can 'legitimately access' and getting 85'd in to as many 
others as possible then it is to progress with your (obviusly not 
anywhere near endgame) guild.

Getting a bunch of random players leap-frogged in everytime some uber 
wants to flag an alt is hardly what the 85/15 backflagging mechanic was 
intended for.

Yeah. Sony will simply gradually raise the monthly rate to 39.95 per 
month, so that we pay for an expansion each month and they don't have to 
bother actually making one. :p
