I just did a search and found a possible answer.  Check:

http://www.quinion.com/words/qa/qa-sou1.htm

It gives the original phrase (west) and the meanings I understood it to have
as well as the more recent Americanized version (south).

"Going west" as a phrase indicating destruction/death dates back to around
1919, while "going south" dates back to around 1974.  Negative-connotation
implications for "going west" date back to the 1500's.
