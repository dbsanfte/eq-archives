If you want to get to Timorous, take the shuttle, zone over, and swim.  Or,
take the raft from Oasis, and get to the Ogre Island.  If, OTOH, you want to
get to Kunark, get PoP, port up to PoK, port down to Cabilis, or FV, if
there is a port down there.  The port down to Cabilis lands you in FoB, away
from the guards.
