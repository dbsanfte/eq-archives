OK, we've all seen the figures, FBSS has xx amount of haste amd RBB has xx
amount.
How are these calculated?
I now own an FBSS...previously I had a lesser Guard of Haste that I was less
than impressed with.
I've read that the best way is to attack yourself with Kick over a period of
time...will I did this with the lesser guard and got a poor improvement over
4mins (buggered if I am gonna do that for 10mins as ppl have suggested)
I also logged a fight with a griffin, this was accurate as it attacks me I
riposte (these are easily removed from the log but they reset the swing time
(didn't realise that, you can attack then riposte the next second but you
following attack appears to come weapon delay/10 secs after the riposte) so
that was not an accurate way and I've now sold the Lesser guard.

The FBSS I thought I'd test a different way and attacked my druid, prolly be
better if druid attacked Warrior thinking about it but nm. Druid didn't
fight back so no ripostes and healed himself to drag the fight out.
With FBSS over 2min 27sec I swung 47 times with a 40 delay weapon, not bad
averages about a swing every 3.13 secs or a delay of 31. That's where the
21% figure comes from, it would seem

Without FBSS over 2mins 41secs I swung 43 times, same 40 delay weapon, even
more impressive as I seem to have about 6% natural haste :�) so the
difference in swings is around 17.5% so now I have that figure.

Is there a better way to calculate this, it seems I've come up with the
figures I've most heard of and if I reversed the situation and gave the
druid the FBSS I'd have a better way of testing, fight would last longer and
no double attacks to discount.
Thoughts?  Still looking for a way to replace my lost strength and AC tho'
:�/
