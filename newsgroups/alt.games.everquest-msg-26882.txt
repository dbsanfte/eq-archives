Along with all the other *great* suggestions already posted,
I'd like to add:

  Many parts of Kaesora.  Awesome.

  The "underside" of the Temple of Cazic-Thule.  It was
  designed either by evil aliens, or zone-artists on drugs.
  The bottom of the Archon pyramid is especially insane,
  and the lowest level of the Avatar pyramid (where the
  Avatar of Fear spawns) is truly "alien".  The AoF
  himself makes a great screenshot too, if you
  like "awesomely ugly".

  Crystal Caverns, the central "well".  Need I say more?
