yup, i'm with howard

you wanna play, you gonna pay. simple as dat...

and despite all the networking issues, ld, the odd crash, stress in your
real relationships...

it's worth every freakin penny !

consider your alternatives. i used to play MTG. it would cost me more then
$50 a month and a great deal of traveling time since you can never purchase
just one booster or single and of course i had to move out of town and had
to travel to play. now i can play with my same friends, make new ones and do
it any time i want. did i forget to mention that it's only $13 a month ?

all considered, EQ ROCKS !!!!!!!!!!!!!

get over it and keep your arms in the vehicle and get ready for one hell of
a good ride ;-)
