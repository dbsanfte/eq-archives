Zone in to shadowhaven from bazzar. Climb the first set of short stairs and
look to your left . You will see a ledge up there and a door. To get to that
door you will have to climb another set of stairs that is in front and to
the left of you. That is probably the easiest potion vendors to find. Notice
they are not on merchant faction however. They are midst and will require
some faction work to use or a sneak skill. There are 2 other similiar sets
of merchants for the other 2 main faction types.
