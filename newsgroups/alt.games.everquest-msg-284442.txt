I've never done any log parsing myself.  That said, I've heard that the
accepted trick for dealing with dual wield parses is to have weapons of
two different types.  I seem to recall that the messages for slashing,
blunt and piercing weapons are slightly different.

This trick is probably most useful for filtering out a single weapon,
when parsing its DPS.  For simply parsing attack rate as a function of
haste buffs, a slower 2H weapon might indeed be less ambiguous (to
avoid multiple attacks in the same "second").
