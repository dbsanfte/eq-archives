I'm organizing spells by type (DoT, DD, Vision, Illusion, etc.).  Each type
of spell gets a series of pages, with the most used of the type at the
beginning of the section.  As the spell is made obsolete, I move it to the
end of the section.  To get to each section, I have a hotkey labeled
"Illus", "DD", "Buff", whatever that takes me there (/book # to take you to
the page number).
