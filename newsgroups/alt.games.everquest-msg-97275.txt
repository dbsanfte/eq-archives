Hello all. I'm a newcomer to the adventures of EQ and as my first
character, I created a dwarven cleric. I have done a little
researching and I know that a cleric must group. I was wondering if
anyone could explain to me the proper etiquette and techniques used by
a cleric while in a group. Specifically, what a cleric must do to
reduce the chances of a monster attacking it, and what functions or
commands would be beneficial to Hotkey. I know this is a loaded
question, but this is a chance for all of you tanks out there to tell
me what it is that I, as a cleric, can benefit you. I know I will make
mistakes as I learn to group, but hopefully, any information provided
here will help me improve my grouping skills. Thanks.
