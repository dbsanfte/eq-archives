No, hide won't make any mob that actively hates you forget about
you.  It won't "clear" the hate list, but it can make mobs that usually
would attack you pass you by if successfull.  It makes them con
indifferent to you.

Rogues get a success message, and during combat the "hide" skill
is actually a little upgrade called "Evade." It lowers you on the hate
list (but will _never_ clear you) obstensibly to allow a "real" tank
to draw hate back and allow the mob to turn his back to you again.
Backstab, evade, repeat.  Rogues are the only ones that have an
"in combat" functionality to hide.
