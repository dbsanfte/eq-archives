Instead of making the drops rares in the specficic dungeons, and let 
luck while camping distribute them -- they made it so that you could 
work towards any drop you wanted and give you measurable progress 
towards it while doing it.

The only bloody restriction is that you have to spend at least enough 
time in the dungeon to earn the single most expensive item you want from 
that dungeon.

For crying out loud... how is that unfair???

You are asking to be able to acquire drops from dungeons without going 
there. Might as well complain that you since you like raiding VT -- any 
Kael & NtoV drops you want should also drop there. Its the same thing.
