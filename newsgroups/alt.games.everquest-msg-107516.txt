Just reached 46.. I have been soloing the two troll guards in Rathe
Mountians up till now but at 45 the exp really slowed down and 46 will just
be worse.  Time to move on, but I have no idea where to move on to.. I want
a place where I can solo and single pull.  A timed spawn NPC like a guard or
such would be great but not necessary.  Also, if there is somewhere to sell
or a druid ring nearby to get a port to sell from a guildmate that would be
good too, but not required.. Thanks!
