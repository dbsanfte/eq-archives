A few equipment thoughts. . .

Until you hit about 20, items which add mana and hps are going to do you more
good than items that add int. And chr is always good for a chanter. Of course,
you'll want to upgrade mana items for int later; but for now. . .

The ulthorks and walruses in Eastern Wastes drop the walrus fang (or tooth?
can't remember which). It's pretty common and it's lore, which means if there is
a druid quadding these guys (and there usually is), you might be able to bum an
extra one that they can't loot if you ask really nicely and don't make a pest of
yourself. My druid often just destroyed the extras when she hunted them; but I'd
have been more than happy to let a newbie/lowbie loot one if they'd showed up
and asked me politely. Stats are 7/22 +3str +3sta, piercing skill. Very nice
damage/delay for a lowbie caster. No int or chr, but hits magic and while you're
still able to melee might be worth trying to get.

The snow dervs in the same zone drop the frozen mantle (6ac, 10mana, and cold
save, shoulder slot), ring of frost (3int 10mana and cold save), and the frosted
gem (3int 30mana -5str, range slot). These items are all lore and the gem is no
drop, so again, if you went over there and hung out for a night or two, you
might find someone who would let you loot one or all of them. I repeat: ask
nicely, preferably "in character", use complete sentences and proper english,
and don't be a pest; that will get you the best response. I called out locs for
someone to loot these items on a number of occasions; I'd guess plenty of other
people destroy them or let them rot.

Crystal cave is off the Ry'Gorr Fort in eastern wastes and it has a few goodies
that are lore in it too. I've seen the crystal covered shroud, herbalist pack
(weight reducing bag), and oracle robe (int/wis/mana/cold/ac for the back slot)
rot on a number of occasions. . .

FWIW, eastern wastes is a very dangerous zone for anyone under about 30, so keep
invis up (virtually nothing there sees invis) and be very, very, very careful.
Look at a map before you log on (or better yet, print one out). Might not even
be a bad idea to put all your stuff in the bank and go naked, so if you die you
don't risk losing what you have. Everything except the snow bunnies will aggro
you if they see you and all mobs there will be more than able to wipe you out
before you can even blink. =P

Might also consider a skull of jen'tra from Lake Rathe. It gives you 30 mana and
some sv. magic, for your off hand; it's one of those doll graphics. Pretty
common and cheap to buy, should be able to pick one up for 5-10pp in EC.

For the wrist slot, you might want electrum or golden cat's eye bracelets for
chr or maybe electrum or golden jade bracelets (ac, hp and mana). These are all
player made and should be fairly cheap. For the neck, you can get electrum or
gold star necklaces (2 and 4 int, respectively) or cat's eye neck if you want to
boost chr instead. Sapphire necks are much better (4int 4str up to 8int 8str,
depending on the metal used), but also lots more expensive.
