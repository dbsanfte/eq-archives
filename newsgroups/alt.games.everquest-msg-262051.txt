Mob attacks tank puller.  Cleric heals tank.  Mob correctly switches to
cleric.  Wizard, who has not yet cast a spell, activates manaburn AA
and kills mob with one cast.

(When you said "The only way *any* mob is taken down..." , were you still
referring only to aggro kiting?  If so, I retract the above statement.)
