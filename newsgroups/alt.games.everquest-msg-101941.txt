Sounds lovely. Is the BP as 'padded' as it is on wood elves?

Hehe. Leather leggings always looked kinky on half elves, even before
luclin. Since I got my elaborate scimitar, my own whip has pretty much
been relegated to CR gear, but I haven't gotten my gnomeskin
dominatrix outfit replaced quite yet (also, the bums who have taken
pics of it for me still haven't sent me!)

>Oh, also: Effects much enhanced by /dopropertinting, if it works for you ;)

It doesn't. Only result of the tinting patch is that my woven grass
bracer occasionally turns sea green, as did a friend's thurg leather
bracer for some reason (that one is supposed to be plain brown).
That's why I need people to send me screenshots, because I still look
all black from my point of view.

I'll definitely check out your page.
