I've had cablemodem service for a few years now.  Just as
dial-up connections will sometimes lose synch and hang up,
cablemodem service and/or connections will sometimes crap
out for a few seconds/minutes/hours.  It doesn't happen
really often, but it does happen.  No data connection
is perfect, unfortunately.
