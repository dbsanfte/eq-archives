Legally, any minor can play.  It may break the EULA, but, it is not ilegal.
For that matter, given that a minor cannot, in general, agree to a binding
contract, I'm not sure that you could claim they are even breaking the
agreement.  Regardless, Verant specifically, in the EULA allows for minors
playing the game.

Last I checked, the swear filter was something you turn on or off yourself,
so, if you want to see the language, leave the filter off.  Believe it or
not, there are a lot of adults who would prefer not play in an environment
riddled with profanity.
