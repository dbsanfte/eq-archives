Since I never got to do any RvR or PvP I cannot state that you are
wrong but I enjoy immensely Halflife TFC so I don't see how I can not
enjoy the pvp in this game. Plus again this is a brand new game and
unlike other games the entire dev team is staying on as the live team
not being transferred to other projects.  I fully expect more content
and additions to keep the game at high levels fun.

That I didn't know. Interesting I will test that and see if it's true,
if so I will optimize my downtime to compensate.
