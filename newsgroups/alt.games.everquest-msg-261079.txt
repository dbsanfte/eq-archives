Yep. Honestly, it's my only one, though I have to admit that I'm intrigued 
by some of the changes I've heard about in OoW and tempted ... but the real 
reason I'm not likely to come back anytime soon is unrelated to EverQuest 1. 
Fortunately, I keep my account active and still go into the game once a week 
to stay current with patches and drop in on the old gang, do some MGBs at 
the Nexus stone, and then leave. This won't last forever, I'll probably 
cancel sometime soon.

Interesting, isn't it? AGE is to other newsgroups as EverQuest is to other 
MMOGs. The relative maturity, willingness to help, and mastery of the art 
all seem to be on a much higher plane.

You're right, we don't see that here as much. Some, I suppose, but not 
enough for me to even recall one at the moment. I mean, there is certainly 
negativity (witness this thread) but on the whole it seems fairly balanced 
and objective. Most of us who've left the game and continue to come here 
still defend what's good about EverQuest with as much (or more) fervor as 
when we attack what's bad. Compared to other forums and newsgroups, it's a 
pretty rational bunch.
