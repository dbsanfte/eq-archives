Was hunting in SK at Paw yesterday (I think... hehe) and an Evil Fang
attacked us.  When we all (and I mean all of us camping spires) had to log
into Paw in order to survive, we got pissed and banded together...  LOL

We killed him and he had an evil eye bag, some sort of poison resist ring,
and a pair of gloves as well as a couple of regular long swords.

Corpse decay time on this Evil Fang was the usual 7 days round abouts that
is given to Players...  hehe

That's all I've seen though.
