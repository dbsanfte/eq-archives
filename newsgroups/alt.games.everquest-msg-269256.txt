Assuming that your observations are correct (although quite honestly I am 
not assuming it in actuality) you're most likely talking about the high end 
of the game and I've already covered that.

As to lowering the cost of server moves, if push comes to shove (in no less 
than 1 year and more likely 3) you won't get much of a choice besides which 
server you'll be moved to.
