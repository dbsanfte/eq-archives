Uhm...what's the point of killing anything in EQ, when you don't need
the loot?

People kill the fourth warder because he is very hard to kill.  Until
recently, there was no published strategy guide telling you what to
do.  You had to figure it out yourself, or from hints from others who
had done it.  You don't kill mobs like this by just throwing a lot of
good players at them...you have to have a high degree of teamwork and
preparation.  People do this because it is fun.
