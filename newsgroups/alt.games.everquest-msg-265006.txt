Bad example since stealing the car is illegal no matter what you do.

Here's a better one: telemarketing.
You pay for the phone, but they use it to advertise things to you
whether you want the calls or not.

You can hide from them by getting an unlisted number, or getting caller
ID to filter out calls. 
OR As has finally happened in the USA, you get laws passed against it.

The national don't call list.

As long as you accept that they have the right to send to you against
your wishes, and that you have to hide to avoid it, then you are
legitimizing them.

That's not true with telemarketing anymore, since it's not legal for
them to send to you if you're on the _Don't_Call_ list.

It's long past time to do the same to spamming.

See above examples of ways people hid from telemarketers, thus
legitimizing the telmarketers RIGHT to call them in the first place.

You don't seem to get it.  The businesses sending the spam ARE US
Companies.  They've gone through ISP after ISP until no American ISPs
will deal with them so they relay though China or Eastern European
countries who need the cash.

Guys like Alan Ralsky.
Quick web search:  http://computercops.biz/postp237711.html

A quote from that article.
"The computers in Ralsky's basement control 190 e-mail servers -- 110
located in Southfield, 50 in Dallas and 30 more in Canada, China, Russia
and India. Each computer, he said, is capable of sending out 650,000
messages every hour -- more than a billion a day -- routed through
overseas Internet companies Ralsky said are eager to sell him
bandwidth."

>What are they going to do? Make it illegal to do business with crooks? 
>Uh-oh... we all go to jail!

Do you even know what the RICO laws are?
They make it impossible to make money from criminal activity since
ANYTHING deemed "proceeds of crime" can and will be confiscated.

If Spam is made illegal in the USA and placed under the RICO laws, guys
like Alan Ralsky would get their paid-for-by-spam cars, houses etc
confiscated if they continued spamming.

With no one willing to do the actual spamming, the companies that hire
them have to go back to normal advertising.

Even if they hired foreign companies to do the spamming, any actual
BUSINESS that came from the spamming is proceeds of crime, since it was
gained by illegal activity.

When spamming and/or advertising through spam isn't profitable,
Americans will stop doing it.
