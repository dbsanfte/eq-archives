}Are there certain % haste armor/items that are able to stack? If so, what
}are they?

There are a couple of weapons that proc spell haste, Executioner Axe and 
Earthen Axe spring to mind.  This wil stack with other haste items.  But 
it's a proc, so it isn't always on, and the proc doesn't stack with 
chanter/shaman haste, and doesn't last very long at all.  My vote is, not 
worth it.

In general, haste items don't stack.  So if you want mre haste, you'll 
just have to group with a chanter, shaman, or bard. :)
