Lol.

Just out of curiosity, I did a quick google search for "father of 
computer games"  Sid Meier came up most frequently, did not see Scott 
Adams in there at all.  Several other names were mentioned, the guy who 
made the first tic tac toe for a computer 50ish years ago, the ones who 
created pong, or the original "MIT" adventure that Scott Adams based his 
original game on.
