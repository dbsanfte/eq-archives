EQ GOES TO HOLLAND

And there was much rejoicing in the city of Amsterdam.
Sony Online Entertainment has just announced a new server for Europe to be
based in Holland.


We're opening a new server, the second EverQuest server to be located
outside of the United States. The new server is called Kane Bayle and it
will be located in Amsterdam. We will be opening the server as a test server
for a while to help test network and connection issues, so we need to have a
lot of people testing it out. You will be able to access the new server by
running TestEverQuest.exe. Once you do, Kane Bayle will be one of the
servers on the Test Servers selection screen. Remember, though, that this is
a Test server and all of the Test server rules apply.
Important note: Because this is a Test server, we will be wiping characters
when we take the server Live.

Keeping that in mind, we want to encourage you to log into the server and
play for a while. We really want to see how it holds up under a full server
load, and for that we need players logged in and playing. Now is also a good
time to try it out and see if Kane Bayle will provide you EverQuest with a
better Internet connection. So please give it a try.

Thanks for playing EverQuest, and have fun on Kane Bayle!

- The EverQuest Team
