<-- my surname (Serverslayer) comes from the days of Prexus' crashes (there
were major hardware problems a while back)

On our server message boards and in virtually every chat room was "proof"
that me and my guild were doing the crashes (to make uber mobs pop for us,
hahaha)

When it first crashed there were lots of silly explanations why... "orc
pawns were dropping CoF's!" etc.. I guess chinese whispers came into play

The gm did a classic typo too... "GM-SWAT-Dude_xx says, I keep hearing
stories about a guild called Stasis crashing the server and hacking/duping
the game, this is true."  (of course he meant "this is not true").  That was
"print-screened" and posted on the server oards within 5 minutes, haha

And thus im a legandary Prexus hacker, and my guild crashes the server
whenever we want a certain mob up.

So don't mess with me
