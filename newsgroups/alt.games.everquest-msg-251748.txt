Most are horrible, except maybe for int caster ones. The rest are like
other quests in the game on an established server, or in fact even a
new one. Banded armor is better for any newbie class that can wear it.
The tiny stats on the newbie armor are worthless, so you gain far more
from the higher ac of a set of banded. 

While other people on stromm were taking time doing the worthless
newbie armor quests, my dark elf cleric did money quests then bought a
full set of banded from the first dwarf player making it in POK.

Besides it not being very good, on a brand new server the quests
severely choke point with tons of players trying to get the items.

On an established server there is no question that you could earn
money to buy better armors in the bazaar, before getting the mediocre
newbie armor. The large ac on the banded helps you FAR MORE with not
getting hit.

>testament of vanear

Worthless now. Its a book with no AC. Since you can get shields like
the charred guardian for nearly nothing, which have ac AND wis, they
are far better. Newer shields with mana and wis even have popped up
cheap as heck. Vanear is worthless unless you are on a brand new
server and the first person to level to a point of camping the quest
guy.

Agreed on the hammer, but really with POK to everywhere its semi moot.
Its nice for a melee class for a "get out of this area" gate, if they
get lucky and it procs. But I'm not sure you want to run up to a mob
in a plane or somewhere that you can't get out of, then hope it procs.


>JBoots
>rallic pack

Very nice pack really. Both it and the jboots are the type items I
wish they had more quests for. They are useable items which are nice,
but neither one really makes your character "uber." They are just
things people want to have more fun and enjoy the game more. They make
things a bit easier.


>Anything else? Ghoulbane? 

The ghoulbane quest was pretty nice, my druid did it and tossed the
thing to a lil pally I made before they made it no drop.


>Surely there must be an epic or 2 still worth the effort (cleric? mage?
>druid? rogue?)? 

Yes, druid rogue is nice. My druid is 56 and there is nothing campable
or buyable that is really better. The dot is something I use a lot,
since I'm a member of the root rot fan club. But it is also something
you have to drag along part of a guild to help with, a guild who
really has no reason to care if the druid has this fun toy.

I think the epics should have been solo quests. 
They are talking about possible solo instanced content now, which
would make something like that more possible.

The final couple shawls are good, but the quest for them is insane. 

The POTC earring quest is quite good, especially for a druid. Its
basically something you can buy now for around 6k for the components.
But that also sort of doesn't make it a great "quest." 

The "solro" iksar gear was actually fantastic when it first went in,
with higher AC and stats per part than the stuff regular classes got
in the old world. You are right though, on servers now stuff like that
is cheap in the bazaar.

The problem is that there are not more quests for things like the
epics, the rallic pack, jboots, etc. There are also not level
appropriate armor quests for armor which is GOOD when you can do the
quest. Melee and cleric newbie armor is no where near as banded, which
can be had for nearly nothing. So when making the quest, they should
have made it have at least as much AC as banded so it would be
basically better.

The Solro type armors should all be upgraded a lot, without really
having to change the quests. What you can buy on an established server
should be taken into account.

For the game being "everquest", your average player can easily count
the worthwhile questable items on two hands or less. That seems wrong.
