Um,

  Wow!!!  Such vehemence!!!  I'm glad to see that I can get Star Trek
products world wide.  I'm not going to flame ya, you pretty well covered
most of the responses you're going to get anyway.  But seriously:  It's a
game!!  I see so many people posting in here who admit to hating Everquest.
I don't know about everyone else who posts here, but I play EQ to have fun,
to take my mind off the world for a bit.  When EQ begins to stress me out,
I'm going to cancel my account and quit.  Server's down?  Well, rats, guess
I gotta play another game or go tackle those dishes.  Of course you're
obviously trolling but I had a few minutes to spare so I thought, "What the
heck?"  One thing to add though: If there is truly only one number for
International Support, then they do need to address that.
