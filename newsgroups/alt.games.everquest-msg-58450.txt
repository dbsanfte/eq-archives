OK... I am a level 55 enchy, been doing JC since I was about your level. I
just recently got my skill to 204, I can tell you now, youre in for alot of
pain =P
Be prepared to be broke most of the time, it will be worth it in the end
though
What you're gonna wanna do before you even start, is dump all the training
points you can into jewelcraft, which is about 20 I think. After that, you
might wanna wait a few levels, that would also help you gather some cash
Look at this chart, it will give you an idea. just read that training takes
you to 21

Go straight for the Bloods Eye Egate, its easier if you buy supplies in
bulk.
Anyways - I have heard alot of rumors on how to change the success/fail
rate. I dont know what to believe but I used to get it good with high INT
and DEX, both at an even number, but that doesnt seem to be working
lately... basically try to get your INT as high as possible, so you can get
skill more.
If you ever wanna try the dex thing later, Boon of the Garou (level 44)
gives 100 dex
anyways - at the top of the page that I mentioned up there, there are 4
other links, take a look there, that should help you get started too.
