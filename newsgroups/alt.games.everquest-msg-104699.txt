Of course, and my Lesser Healing has pulled my group's collective butt out
of the fire, back in the low 20's.  Still, that's an emergency heal.  By
that time, a Ranger's role is to inflict damage, not to take it or to heal
it.  Of course, I'm preaching to the choir, am I not?

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
