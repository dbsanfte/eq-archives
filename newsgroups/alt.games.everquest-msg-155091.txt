Well, I can tell you that the faction is repairable. My wife and I partner hunt
and we killed the Millers a few times, thereby putting our faction on the road
to ruin. After 3 days of solid mowing down of the raiders in NK along the
shoreline east of the SK bridge, we have maxed our faction with Qeynos guards
and citizens. The most effective way I found was Earthquake. And, the buggers
drop bronze about every 5th spawn, not a big deal, but a little pocket change
when sold at the gypsy camp. Hope this helped. =)
