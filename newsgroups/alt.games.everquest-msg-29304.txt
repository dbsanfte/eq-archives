I am decideing whether to come to everquest and leave asherons call in the
past. I just need some help understanding some things.

First of all, what is some of the most MAJOR differences?  i know that eq
has something called zones? wtf is this?

In AC, i have played as a mage and a melee char, which is probably the best
class to go with on EQ?

AC cost 10 bux a month to play, i just read that EQ is now free?  now if
this is true, i will truly go to EQ :).

ty

Kurokaze LvL 35 UA Asherons Call
Hell Baron LvL 15 Mage Asherons Call

ps: ah, in asherons call the maximum lvl is lvl 126, what is the maximum lvl
on EQ?
