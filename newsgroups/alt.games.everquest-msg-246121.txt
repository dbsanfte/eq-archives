My apologies also for jumping all over you. Was alos uncalled for.

Call it a knee jerk reaction from a warrior thats grown weary of seeing the
knight's bitch about things and have SOE ( apparently ) leap to thier beck
and call when it took seemingly YEARS To get any kind of response to the cry
from warriors that were simply not needed.

And to forstall whining from other quarters ( not you AP ), Yes, I knew what
I was getting into when I made my warrior. Call me an optimist but I keep
believeing that they'll someday make it better.... *snort*
