Hah. I forgot all about my favorite first level spell. I actually
advocate using that spell to heal in controled instances up to level
19 or so. Until you get your 100 point heal. It's mana efficiency can
not be matched at that level.

There is also the Curse line. Which I haven't used in a while, because
I haven't run the LDoN's I need for them. All I have is the level 34
one. Which at it's level was pretty durn awesome. Only problem is
their long recast time, so if it is resisted, the mob is likely to be
dead by the time you can recast it.

It's a matter of looking at what DoT's you have, how long it takes for
the mob to drop, what role you are currently filling, and consequently
was other spells you have to save your mana for.

Yeah, but significantly behind in terms of levels, a lot of levels in
some cases. Shamans get better debufs sooner, and more of them. Shaman
debufs are king. In the case of Slows it takes the shaman quite a few
levels to attain that status of king, but if you have only one group
slot left and you want someone to debuff the mobs, choose a Shaman.
Just about anything you might want debuffed, can be by a Shaman.

Of course that's just my opinion.
