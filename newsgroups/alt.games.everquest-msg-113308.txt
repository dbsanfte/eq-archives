Thing is, most of the "worts" places simply turn into "bring a coffin".  I
went LD for several hours in the Halls of Testing in Temple of Veeshan.  Log
back in to get smacked for 200+ by a wyvern and find myself at bind point.
It would take at least 24 folks to go get it, instead it took me (cleric), a
porter, and a necro.

I think the absolute worst are the places where you'll be at lower levels
then corpse summon is widely available.  Like 3rd floor of Dalnir.  Rarely
hunted dungeon combined with medium level mobs = dangerous CR.
