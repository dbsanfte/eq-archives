Here it is once again, for those in the cheap seats...


NOTHING JUSTIFIES TERRORISM...

Listening to you guys, one would think that 9/11 was just fine with
ya'all...  After all, it was done, partly, on behalf of the
Palestinians, so you don't have a problem with it, right??

After all, it's America's fault for supporting ISrael, right??

So the attacks on the Pentagon and the WTC was simply another way that
the Palestinians can fight back, eh??

That's what you believe, right??

Consider this.  

It probably cost millions to put together the 9/11 attacks...

Wouldn't that money had been better spent by buying food and clothing
for Palestinians??  Wouldn't schools and clinics be better??

I am SURE that the money could have been better spent rather then use
it to kill 3300+ Americans and other nationals 20,000 miles away, eh??

But of course, you don't believe that, right??  

Whatever is done on behalf of the Palestinians is justified, right??
After all.... Israel is at fault...

Do you guys comprehend how utterly sick, perverted and disgusting you
sound???
