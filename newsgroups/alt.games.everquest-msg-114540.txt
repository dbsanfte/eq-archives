I don't know that I'd call them morons, but I agree that it's rather
lame to be shouting Ding! every freaking time you level. Especially
the lower levels. Woo, you've made level 3? Hurrah, maybe one day you
can learn to tie your own shoes, too!

There used to be certain milestone levels where shouting Ding seemed
appropriate, such as the hell levels, but they're gone now. I see no
harm in telling one's guild or friends about leveling up, but as a
total stranger, I really don't give a hoot if you've just leveled. It
just doesn't qualify as news.
