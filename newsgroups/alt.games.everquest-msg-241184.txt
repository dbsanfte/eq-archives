Yeah, I bet they do, too, which is part of why I'll probably never 
actually get around to playing with macro programs much.  It's a lesser 
consideration, though, compared with "Is Xylobot really worth $20 to me?" 
and "Am I really going to want to invest the time it looks like it'd take 
to get this set up and working?"  Especially since I'd want to set up a 
second computer to run all that stuff on, and that'd be messy... Probably 
require buying a new video card at the least.  And then I have to actually 
write or adapt the auto-foraging script...  I think I'd rather spend 
the time actually playing EQ, all in all. :)

I wouldn't worry overmuch about the IP thing, though.  My ISP gives me a
new dynamically assigned IP address every time I reboot the computer.  So 
in order to ban associated accounts on that basis, they'd probably have to 
take out everyone using that block of IPs, which, with sbc yahoo being a 
major provider, could be quite a few.  And just to be thorough, sbc yahoo 
provides free dialup modem access to DSL users, so main account stays on 
DSL, cleverly macroed account goes to the dialup pool.  Presto!  We're in 
different places, and my GF bitches at me because her friends say the 
phone's busy all the time. :)

For the moment, Mike Vance's old account is therefore relegated primarily 
to the role of being an insta-newbie to form a raid with so I don't get 
hosed by the Trivial Loot Code.  But I did manage to forage up a morning 
dew! :)
