Umm... you seem content driving the trolley off the tracks and off
into the forest somewhere. We were talking uber guilds, and what they
do and you tossed out what a general new player might like to do.
Hence, not the subject at hand. If you want to start a thread on newer
players and their prediliction towards older content, feel free. If
people formerly uber are off frolicking in yesteryear, feel free to
post that too. But don't think i'm gonna be taken down the garden path
of every thing that might come to your mind as a subject to converse
on.

That time during which the guild isn't raiding. You aren't required to
grind AA.. what you do when not raiding is pretty much up to you, even
being a member of an 'uber guild'. And regardless of your feelings, no
guild raids 7 days a week, no breaks on end. If they did it would be
fast burnout. Usually xp or free days are interspersed throughout the
schedule to break up the pace. And really, there are only so many
spawns to go around and when only minor stuff is up, there isn't much
to raid.

Macros tend to be more inherently susceptible to failure because they
tend to be not as well thought out and tested. At the same time, the
people making the macro programs don't exactly have a staff of
thousands that can think out and test every contingency. It usually
boils down to.. 'this would be cool to have' and then trying to write
a function for it that hopefully works, does on their specific system
and when someone else tries it it breaks.

And I'm willing to concede you this one to a point.

Oh... i can mock Kunark. There were *raids* in Kunark? :>

I think I was mocking Velious earlier. Give me time and i'll get
around to the wonders of the Crag Beast Queen or whatever that
retarded mob is out in Natimbi.

You would have to have at least two sets of macros.. class-specific
and event-specific strapped to objects. The class specific would be
inherited upon character generation as part of the class and the
event-specific would be loaded as part of the event strats.

It would work similar to raids now. People learn how to play their
class, then a raid leader leads people through the 'strats' of how
their class is to use their abilities to perform during each part of a
specific event, say RZTW. Would a raid leader lead? Nah.. he'd pass
out the specific macros to the appropriate bots which had allready
been formulated over previous failures until it could succeed
effectively. Would it be super-trivial blow you away, omg i'm allready
done easy? No.
