Look at the fine antique ring quest in plane of knowledge.

Results in an ac3 30mana 30hp mana preservation 2 ring and will take less
than 30 minutes to do and a few pp if servers have been up a bit for
merchants to get stocked with the quest items.

Eventually you will probably want to upgrade to either Crystaline Torque or
Obulous Death Shroud (mana preservation 3) or Boots of Vengeful Fury (mana
preservation 4).
