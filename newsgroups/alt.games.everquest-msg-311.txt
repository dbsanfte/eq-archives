The effect of religion in EQ is relatively small. For starters, it
affects your starting faction. An agnostic enchanter, for example,
will be able to travel more freely than one linked to a deity.

The other effect that has only recently begun to show is that certain
items are diety-linked. You would have to be a worshiper of the deity
in question to use the item.
