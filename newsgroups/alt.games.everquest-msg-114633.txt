You are correct.

But you'll have to zone (or camp and re-enter) after each switch,
since your higher language skill doesn't "set" until you zone.
When you improve your skill at a language, you don't get access
to your improved skill until you zone.

Also, I've done tests, and it doesn't matter how much text
is on a line of a "language lesson".  You have as much chance
of getting a language skill-up receiving a message of "Hi"
in the Trollish language in group chat as you do receiving
the message, "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog".
And the former is less of a load on your and your recipient's
modems, not to mention Verant's bandwidth.
