 I just stopped responding to him. From the personal attacks it's sorta
obvious he's just a whiner that wants everything handed to him on a

 A good example is level 65 spells. I don't see anyone in my guild
whining that level 65 spells don't drop in any of the zones we happen to
be in now. We just realize there is a certain progression and are
working towards that end.

 Not to mention that the non-component spell version also dropped there.
And was No Drop.
