Nope.  There's one particular merchant in the necro guild in Neriak, as I 
recall, that won't sell to me even though I'm ally there.  As I recall, 
she says something like, "I'm sorry, I have nothing to do with enchanters.  
Move along."

There's a similarly-minded guildleader in Erudin palace.  Her issue was 
with my gnomishness, though, so a quick illusion fixed her attitude.  But 
I'm KoS there now, so I can't go doublecheck that.  :) From the same 
bugged kill that made me ally to Neriak necros, strangely enough.  Stupid 
bugged illusion: guktan quest, sigh.

I've encountered this sort of thing a few times, and the only way around 
it was to do my business with them via an alt.  It's only ever been mobs 
in guilds in cities on the original 3 continents.

Before you say "Period", make sure you've tried every NPC in the game, eh?
