That too:)  Didn't mean to offend, I certainly spend my fair share of time
in EQ, perhaps some chars lvl faster than others...however, since I have a
wizard main, perhaps I am missing something...mine takes forever...if I were
to lvl her up 5 lvls lets say in IO, it would literally take me 20 hours,
and that's with just me getting all the exp...I did 2 levels the other day,
and it took 7 hours! (Aack! My tolerance level for tedium must be dreadfully
low(1)) I did the lvling with a 34 druid, btw, who did the pulling,
snaring/rooting and I did the DD work(we were not grouped, so I got all the
exp)...so it was quick in some respects, but that exp bar moved VERY
sloooowwwly, even though everything conned blue or lightblue to me, and I
received exp from everything.  That is the only thing I have to base any
kind of lvling on Sang, and given that a char is taken from 0-60 in less
than 3 weeks, that is one hell of a lot of time spent on a computer.  I have
always believed that excessive time spent online in a fantasy social
environment is detrimental to one's RL social skills...I do not limit this
to EQ but to chat rooms and other crap as well, and on this point we just
agree to diasagree, and that's cool with me:) Happy holidays~
