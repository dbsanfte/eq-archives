Correct, I was one of the folks who did the testing.  Surprised me,
it did -- I had originally thought that swim skill did increase
"time-to-drown", but it doesn't.

The other interesting discovery is that once you start drowning,
you always take exactly the same amount of time to drown no
matter how many max HP you have.  Each "drowning cycle" removes
1/8th of your max HP, so no matter how buffed you are -- or how
newbieish, you take the same amount of time to die.

Insert "drowning kittens" joke here.
