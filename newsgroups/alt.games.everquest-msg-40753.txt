Personally, I think that the loss of being able to easily tell who is who
is not worth the framerate enhancement. This has gotten better with velious
however...with all the armor textures that people can wear, it is often not
too difficult to tell people apart just by armor color, without names.

But removing names definately gives a noticeable speed increase.

Remove epic weapon particles, would be the only reason I could think of.
PoG and PoM it would also reduce the lag if you were near "atmospheric"
particles...never been to PoM, but PoG has the waterfalls. Not much
fighting goes on near them however, so this isn't really a big deal.
