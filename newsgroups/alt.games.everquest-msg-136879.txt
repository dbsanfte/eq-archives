Guess you should learn the art of sarcasm then, because your post simply 
sounded as thought you were making a statement you believed to be factual. 
It's not as easy to tell sarcasm in a text posting as it is in person, 
reading the sentence "Of course, turning off the new ui prevents the 
download of patches...", even while knowing it's blatantly wrong, does not 
give even the slighest hint of sarcasm.
