}Actually, SoE has never given any information on expected success/failure 
}rates.  It has all been figured out by people doing massive amounts of 
}combines, and then fitting formulas to the data.  SoE has been extremely 
}close mouthed about how it actually works.

This is not quite entirely true.  The specific example I'm referring to is 
from the July 10, 2003 patch message:

"- Tradeskill chance of failures changed -  The higher your skill is over 
the trivial of the combine, the less likely you are to fail with a 
combine.  This is a reduction on the chance to always fail."

As it happens, I was skilling up lowbies on July 9th and again on July 
10th.  And I noticed a change, all right.  But it's an apparent -increase- 
in the chance to always fail, if your skill happens to be exactly equal to 
the trivial.  And contrarily, I have not noticed a large reduction in 
failures on very trivial combines... it was about 1 in 20 before, and 1 in 
20 after.  of course, it could be 1 in 25 or 30 now, and I wouldn't notice 
the difference, because my sample sizes weren't that large and I didn't 
parse.

But the thing is, before this patch, success rate seemed to steadily 
increase as skill increased.  Which makes sense.  Now, it steadily 
increases until you hit the trivial, then it -sharply- decreases, and then 
increases again.  Which makes no sense whatsoever.  But again, I haven't 
parsed, so it could just be an apparent effect, or the RNG messing with 
me, or something.

But yes, Laurefin's success rate formula was not released by SOE. :)
