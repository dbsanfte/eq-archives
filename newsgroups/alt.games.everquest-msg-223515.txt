I'd forgotten about clerics!  The one caster class that solos as well as 
a pure melee.  =)  At least, from what I've gathered.  I've played a 
cleric for only two sessions, following my husband (warrior) around in 
the Freeport newbie zone and in EC.  CompUSA was selling Trilogy for 
only 9.99, and he had a hankering to play.  A hankering which has 
already burned itself out.  Alas -- no Teapray/Lenny setup for *me*!  =)

Oops.  Juggling, right.  Sounds like an amusing image either way -- the 
bard as a one-man band!

Hmmm.  That's dangerously encouraging.  =P  =)
