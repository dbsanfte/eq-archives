i missed something because you can kill halflings in nektulos forest to get
easy faction with "dread guard outer" dread guard inner"  then from the
helmets they drop take those and turn 4 in at a time to warrior guild leader
to get faction with him, you can do that at dubious, THE DEAD faction is a
pain and i suggest you not even bother, just kill halflings to get city folk
to like you and then go back to feerot to train
