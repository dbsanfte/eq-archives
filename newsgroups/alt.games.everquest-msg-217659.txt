He is asking for a nerf but most who have tried both know he is just wrong.

All pet groups I have been in as my chanter usually take about 70 minutes on
normal. My chanter has more dps then either the necro or magician untill
such time as they decide to pull multiples and kill my dps. (pet charm for
100dps , nukes for avg~ 1220 for 260 mana plus crits)

Bard
Ranger
Rogue
Cleric
Monk
Beastmaster

Did a hard assasinate in 30 minutes. I had a character in both groups :p
