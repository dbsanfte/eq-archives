I don't care for the art on most of the new models.  If you take a
minute to look you'll notice all the faces of all the races actually use
the same base model (just different eyes, skin tone, & stretched or
manipulated a little) which looks really stupid.  I had them off for a
long time, but I can't do that any more due to the horse nerf.  I
absoluely hate it.
