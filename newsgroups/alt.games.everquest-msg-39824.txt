Absor Adds More Talk To Experience
Giraffa [1/16/2001-4:37:41 PM]  Comments[3]
On the popular producers letter thread
(http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048475-2.html),
Absor responds shortly to a few raving fans:

Qwase wrote:
"Ok, just a question. If I have my friend the 56 SK go a die like 50 times,
and wait to res him after the patch. Will he get extra XP since his lost XP
will be calculated with diferent numbers?"

Sorry, no. We thought of that one too, and we're making sure that doesn't
happen. You will get experience upon resurrection based on the way you were
receiving experience on death. So if you die before the patch, resurrection
after the patch will give you the same experience return that it would have
before the patch.

"I believe they've said the new experience system is up on the Test Server
right now."

/em waves at Drysart
Yup. Been up for nearly a week. Testing the heck out of it.

Serril said:
"What two classes have you decided to leave with experience penalties?
Hazarding a guess I'd say druids and necromancers, but I'd like to know for
sure."

Actually, we've decided to leave the two classes that had bonuses (warrior
and rogues) as they were.

Saeul said:
"There is still penalty for soloing imposed on all classes except
warriors/rogues, but that penalty is now very small (~10%??)."

Nope. The 'penalty' is completely gone. It doesn't matter if you group or
not, there will no longer be any more experience needed for one class over
another, with the exception of the Warrior and Rogue, which will get a
slight bonus. The experience change for hybrids and other over-costed
classes is a separate thing from the group experience bonus.

Verant is unfair to crickets.

Hot Topic: Experience changes in EQ
Catalyst [1/15/2001-11:07:51 AM]  Comments[16]

Verant has recently announced some huge changes to the experience system in
EverQuest (see yesterday's news). From improving the exp zones give out,
improving group experience, and eliminating a lot of class based EXP
penalties it looks like Verant is taking large strides to encourage grouping
and overall make the game more enjoyable for it's players. But what do you
think about these new changes? How will they affect how you play EQ? Will
you now switch from soloing constantly to grouping? Will you consistently
play more hybrid classes? If you have any thoughts on the upcoming changes,
please stop by and share them with us on this special thread I've
created.(http://www.everlore.com/MB_SHOW.asp?FID=76&FN=MainHall&SID=7&SN=Eve
