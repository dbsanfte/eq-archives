Fast weapons and haste and you'll still have to swap, obviously.  The other
thing is to prime all the weapon skills with all the points you can as you
get them.  There's little reason to save level points, IMO.

Unless you twinked with VERY good weapons, you should have two sets:
one for killing things (decent ratio) and another for skillups (fast and
forget
the ratio.)   With the cost of weight reduction bags, that's not a huge
issue,
even for monks.
