I think it really depends on what class you play and how you play...

I have seen some that gets better as you run with less weight, perfect 
for monks, some that works better with less bags, perfect for bards or 
at least how i play them, and some that works when your not in your true 
form, anyone that changes forms such as druids, shaman, chanter and so 
forth.

I personaly do not have any charms (yet) but i am working on that one. /grin
