Geonids in Crystal Caverns. Kill lots of orcs in there first to gain
faction with the Dwarves in there, that way you can sell and bank and
hunt right in the same zone, hard to beat that. Orcs drop decent loot
anyway,
Velium weapons, Frozen weapons, gems, research components and Velium ore.
Geonids drop nice loot but are usually camped, just hunt orcs until they are
open.

Goblins in SolA. Kill some kobolds in SolB first to raise faction with
the Gnomes in SolA so you can sell right in SolA. Goblins drop decent plat
and fine steel.

Grimlings in the caves in tenebrous they drop moon gems and
acrylia ore that sells well in the bazaar. Also the wandering aliens drop
moon gems and acrylia ore.
