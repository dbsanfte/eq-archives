It's pretty easy to get the bash in (actually interrupting a cast is
another matter, heh).  What works for my L25 Warrior alt is a pair of
hotkeys: the inventory slot where I keep the shield and the secondary
melee slot, with the two hotkeys adjacent to each other and on the
same bank as bash.  Most of the time while fighting this way I have
the shield on my cursor, hovering over the secondary melee hotkey.
To bash I swap the shield in, hit the bash hotkey, and swap the shield
back out all in a bit under a second.  The reason for keeping the
"storage" slot hotkeyed is so that the shield is right there when
combat starts unexpectedly or when I want to drop the shield off my
cursor for some reason.  I don't bother trying to bash when using a
two-hander or when lag is a problem.  Note the "a bit under a second"
above, I actually pause half-a-beat between each action to make sure
that when the server sees the bash it also sees me with a shield
equipped, the required pause to be sure of this gets too long when
you're laggy.  And the extra steps required with a two-hander (grab
2hander, swap with shield, equip shield, bash, grab shield, swap with
two-hander, equip two-hander, is lots messier than the simple 2 click
swap dual wielding) along with the near certainly wasted attack cycle
(you punch for 1 damage!) make it pretty ineffective.

Oh, and one other note...
If you actually enjoy doing this (I do it occassionally, but I can't
say I actually enjoy it) you would probably have a lot more fun
playing a bard instead.  This simple little situational gear swap is
the sort of thing bards do synchronously with twisting 3 songs and
complaining in group chat:
a_bard_01 tells the group, 'so sorry'
a_bard_01 tells the group, 'guys i'm'
a_bard_01 tells the group, 'only a'
a_bard_01 tells the group, 'bard not'
a_bard_01 tells the group, 'a chanter'
a_bard_01 tells the group, 'i can'
a_bard_01 tells the group, 'only mez'
a_bard_01 tells the group, 'three mobs'
a_bard_01 tells the group, 'sorry you'
a_bard_01 tells the group, 'died kaev'
