I've noticed the same problems... I've modified my system.ini file as
recommended someplace.. I've changed my vid card (also GForce 2 Ultra 64) to
disallow anti-aliasing and Vert sync...  Still.. same problems.  I DRAG BUTT
in Qeynos, Freeport, basically anyplace with higher-detail textures on the
walls... NO problems with this in Everfrost though where everything is
white. - not until I go into Halas.
