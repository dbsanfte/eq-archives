Yeah, but you don't understand my luck. I burned my life's supply and
dippend into my next life's finding my (soon to be) fiance. ;-) 

Even before then, my luck was in short supply. I could have an insane
bad streak making edible goo at 170 baking almost daily if I felt the
urge to make it every day...

So, hitting that 5% and making the backpack was a major shock to me.
