Seems like tailoring materials got the worst of it, for some reason. 
Wierd prices i gave spotted on tailoring materials:

Spider silk 50pp each (usually 5-15pp, a lot higher than before bazaar)
Flawless Rockhopper hides 600pp (100-200pp normally)
Excellent Sabertooth Tiger Hides 1000pp (usualy buy for 25pp or less in 
IllOmen)
Haze Panther Skins 2000pp (not sure on price before, but 2K just for 
skin means that between 33-50% failure rate = loss on price of complete 
item)
Terrorantula Silk 1000pp each (AFTER the adding of baby terrorantulas in 
Sro)
