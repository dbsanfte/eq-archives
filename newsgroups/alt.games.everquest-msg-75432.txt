He can use the Key you DIDNT enter in to actovate EQ, if on the other hand
you activated both keys they shold be on differnt login names and passwords.
So you can cancel the one you no longer use and let him have the login name
and pass. Then all he has to do is login under that name and change the
billing to his CC.

Dunno if your are officialy allowed to do this tho *grin*
