Considdering 3dfx sold the company to nvidia a few years ago. and since that
time has no longer been supported except by individuals "hacking" the
firmwares and what not to keep it up to date.  I think 3dfx owners knew this
time would eventually come when they wouldnt be able to play certain games
anymore. im surprised it took as long as it did, I sold my voodoo3 a
longgggg time ago.
