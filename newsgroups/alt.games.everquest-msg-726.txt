If you manage to outrun the mob far enough to be able to take the time
to stop and cast a heal spell.

I'd sell the leather padding (Unless you intend to become smith fine
plate :) ) but I'd keep the silk threads/cords/swatches for later use.

>3a)  Can you gate out of battle?

Yes, if you stand still and either don't get hit or manage to channel
through hits while the spell is cast. Later on, you get evac spells:
rapid group gates for getting your group out of a sticky battle.

>3b)  If so can you do it while running from the mob?

If you move from the spot you started casting, the spell will
interrupt. You can turn around, but nothing more.
I've heard of casters being knocked out of a corner while casting an
evac, running back to the exact spot before the spell finished, and
getting the spell off.

>4)  Why do I seam to interrupt my spells if I move while casting? (like
>trying to heal myself while running for my life)

Because you *are* interrupting them :)
The ability to break off a spell like that can come in handy, either
for halting a group gate or preventing a mana-expensive heal or nuke
on a dead mob or healed group member.
