It's not that we *can't*. It's that we're definitely not *good* at it.
HP and AC wise, we don't stack up to "real" tanks. If we are tanking,
that means the healer has to be more on the ball than normal. With a
good healer, a tanking BST can manage. With a bad healer, BST tanking
is nowhere near as forgiving as war/sk/pal tanking. I think in a lot
of cases, it's more lack of faith in the healer than their own
abilities.
