Ok, I no absolutely nothing about being a monk.  But I did find and Ulak of
some kind (with decent newbie stats-and NOT rusted) on a mechant for under
2pp.  I snatched it up and gave it to a friend with a 10th level monk alt.
So be on the lookout at various merchants.

Also, what about those weighted gloves that drop at pretty low levels??  Are
those really any good to a monk?
