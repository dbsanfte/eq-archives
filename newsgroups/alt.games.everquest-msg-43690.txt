Are you having trouble with any other websites?  Have you tried doing a
tracert to any of their servers?  If you are having problems elsewhere, or
if tracert shows timeouts, then try contacting your ISP and letting them
know that you are having connectivity problems, they may be able to at least
tell you where the problem is, and who knows, maybe even fix it.
