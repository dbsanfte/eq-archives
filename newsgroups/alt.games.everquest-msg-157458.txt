The guildmasters in PoK will trade in the old class-specific Fear/Hate armor
for their class, and give you XP and an item.  Just ask them "what armor?"

I had full bar 60, and dinged to 61 when I handed in one of my old Insidious
pieces to the enchanter GM.

For 3 pieces handed in, I got: Gift of Brilliance spell (blah), Blue Diamond
(woohoo!) and Raw Diamond (woohoo!)
