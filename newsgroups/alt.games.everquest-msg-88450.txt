    I love the differences in names. On Quellious the floor camps are LC,
RC, BR (left/right corner, back room), Eyes is SH (safe hall), Frenzy is US
(upper spiders), tents/pits is UD/LD (upper/lower dogs), and the deep pit
area where the Broodmother lives is LS (lower spiders).

    Our Seb camps are King, Juggs/Reets, Ilis Jail (your LZO), D1, D2,
Portal (your UZO), Nec/Guard (your Necro), Nec Jail (your Gang), Chef, CEB
(Crypt, with Blood and Emperor), and Arm/Bar (the area including Bartender
and whichever of Armorer or Armsman isn't in Chef).
