I am paying $10 per hour, up to 40 hours for your time.  I need help in
acquiring a full set of Cobalt Armor, Cloak of Flames, a few kpp, and
weapons.  I will trade you 1 batwing for each item that you have, and 1
snake fang per 10kpp.

Please reply to this post on estimated hours for you to help me with my
request.  I'd give my email address, but someone by the name of Graefaxe
Graefaxe@notmaixlx.com, keeps telling my ISP's and email providers that I am
spamming him.  I sent him one email, and then apologized for it.  Ohh, well.

Anyway, thanks for your help.
