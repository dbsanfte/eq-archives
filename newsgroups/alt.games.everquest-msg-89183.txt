Not _all_ the time, no.

Yes. This is the easiest way to powerskill to 135, if money is not a
problem and you don't care about success.

IF you want to make something easy with a reasonable chance of success,
as well as skill up, I would choose Fish Fillets to skill 82, then Fish
Rolls. Fish Fillets are Fresh Fish + Jug of Sauces (check eqtraders.com,
don't trust me =)) and you should have at least decent success at 30.
Once you are at 82 you will again have at least decent success on Fish
Rolls, all the way up to 135.
