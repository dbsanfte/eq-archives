A lot of people today *don't* level a character up to to 50 in months. A 
lot of people today buy the game and are swept into the pok by their 
friends or the first person they meet, and from their they're pointed 
into a PC group, then into an OT group, and end up effectively leeching 
50th in a PoP group... with their 1st character.
