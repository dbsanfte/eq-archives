Lets talk best case, not hitting every zone, just every continent. 
Starting in Paineel, running to Gfay then boating to Kunark and then to
Velious.  With SoW on  2 hours from Qeynos to Freeport.  15 minutesX2
boat rides 15 minutes through Odus, and ditto for Faydwer.  If you elect
to tag Halas and Perma thats another 30 minutes or so.  so Old world
without tagging south Antonica is 4 hours  South Antonica would be
another hour+  Kunark figure an hour or 2 +30-45 minutes for the boat is
8 hours Assuming Shaman/druid level 14 for bind/gate puts you back in
NRo to catch raft to velious.  Assuming you just tag up zones. figure
another couple 3 hours in Velious so with SoW bind and Gate you've got
11+ hours.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
