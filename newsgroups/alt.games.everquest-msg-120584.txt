Hehe, dont say VI always screw things up in the patch, I logged in and 
got a nice little surprise.
I been one of the stupid druids who wanna do tradeskills and like it, so 
of course used my tradeskills to do the PoTC quest (finished 3 days 
after the first druid finished the quest). For that i got the PoTC spell 
(level 59 druid single target PoTG), and a nice earring:
Earring of the Solsticke: Wis 5, int 5, mana 40, hp 40, all/all.

But when i logged in after this patch, VI have actually held their 
promise to reward Xanthe for being the first druid to complete the 
quest, and now i had:
Xanthe's Earring of Nature: AC 5, str 8, sta 8, wis 10, mana 55, hp 55, 
fire/cold/magic 7, effect Circle of the Combines (24 sec cast time), 
reccomended level 51, nodrop, lore, druid/all.

So now im a happy little druid, although i guess the non-druids who did 
the quest before the patch just to get the earring (both spell and 
earring are nodrop) are quite pissed by now.

Oh, and just to prove the rule of faulty patches, VI have managed to 
screw it up anyway, so the earring report its out of charges when you 
try to port with it. :)
