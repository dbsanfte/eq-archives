ISPs have started to drop Usenet groups for supposed "copyright" reasons
in some cases.  I challenge you to find one who has done so for 
"political" reasons.  "Probably for good reasons", such faith ye have in 
ye corporate masters...

I've never read the group.  I suppose you think it's racist.  Fine.  So
don't read it.  Exercise YOUR free will.  Instead of trying to superceed
someone elses.  Plenty of other people must think it's NOT racist.  And
plenty of other people must think OTHER groups are racist.  To each his
own, netcop.  You'd probably enjoy spending your time more at www.wwf.com 
then here.  Good luck.

You never answerd what you "thought I was entitled to", which was the 
biggest reason I keep replying.  But your artfully dodged my direct 
question on it.  Oh well.

No one was being a religious bigot.  But you are being paranoid.  You're
some kind of piece of NIMBY work.  Why is it that you detest freedom of
speech?  And are you really doing any such thing to curtail it?  Or just
paying lip service here yakking about it?
