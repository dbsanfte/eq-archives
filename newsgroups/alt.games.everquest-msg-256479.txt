Not a major quibble, but not a minor quibble either.  The mage is not
quite the solo'ers paradise people make it out to be, due to the lack
of root.  And believe me, the earth pet is no solution: their root is
very short lived, doesn't give you the ability to place rooted mobs
where you want them, is often undesirable, and not very reliable.

But, despite lack of root, when I played EQ as a mage, I did enjoy the
class, and would happily recommend it to anyone.
