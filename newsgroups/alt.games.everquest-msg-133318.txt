}Can you get skill points faster by trying combos that are well above your
}trivial level?

Mmmmmaybe.  Nobody really knows for sure.  In my personal experience, I 
think the peak of the curve is trying things that are about 8-10 points 
above your skill in trivial.  It's pretty clearly lower if you try things 
that are 40-50 points higher, and it certainly sems lower to me if it's 
3 points higher (but it would be very easy for my perception of that to be 
biased.  It's inherently more frustrating to me when I'm expecting 
something to go trivial any minute, and it doesn't.)

}At skill 191, the next triv is black pearls (no avail at vendors).  Skip it
}and go to the next avail stone at vendors? Skip all the 50pp - 90 pp stones
}and try doing cheap gems with plat bars?

I would do the stones that are less than or equal to 105pp, ie, the cost 
of a platinum bar.  Actually, I think I did gold-ruby as well, and it 
worked out.  Your success rate is better enough to make it cheaper.

}What would you think my % chance of success would be walking around trying
}to make plat str/int/wis items (235-245) with my 191 skill? Is there a
}formula?

There's a variety of formulas under discussion.  They are mostly of the 
form:

%chance of success = (X*skill level)-trivial+Y

The majority seems to be leaning toward X=1.15, and Y in the 65-70 range.
The formula is capped at both ends.  Results below 5% are 5%, above 95% is 
95%.

There is a small group that insists X must be 1.0, as near as I can tell 
because this leads to a simpler looking formula... However it also 
contradicts my personal experience, in that on low-trivial things, I have 
a lower than 95% success rate right when it goes trivial, while with high 
trivial things, I have already had the 95% for a while when this happens.  
X in the 1.1-1.2 range models this nicely.

They have a big pile of data, but no hard points on the curve, so there's 
a lot of debate about how to draw a line through the data. :)

Anyway, with X=1.15 and Y=70, skill 191, trivial 235,

%C = (1.15*191)-235+70=54.65%

So probably right around half.  Note that a geerlok gemsetter will improve 
your odds by 1.15*0.05*191=10.98%

And at 245 trivial, it's 10 points higher, so 10% less.
