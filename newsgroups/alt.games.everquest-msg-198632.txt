I've just recently discovered the existence of these quests and have moved my
36 pally to Dawnshroud peaks to start to try and acquire some of the quest item
components.  Haven't been in the zone that long but was in a good group last
night and we we're doing a lot of killing.  I was very dissapointed that at the
end of the night after all the killing we had done not one quest component had
been looted and we were fighting all things that were supposedly dropping
common items.  We were fighting tribal gatherers and zelniaks etc.  Is this
stuff going to be very hard to come by or is there a certain part of the zone
that's better to fight in?  We were by the maidens eye zone line.  Any help
greatly appreciated.
