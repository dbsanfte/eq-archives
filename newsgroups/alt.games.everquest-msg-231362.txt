 >Kill the Gor Takus?

You would think, wouldn't you? :P Unfortunately, I can go
in, kill a couple of caves full of them before any respawning
starts and they get replaced with Gor Takus again. OTOH, I
can kill a cave full of Shak Drathas (did this last night)
and they get replaced with Gor Takus.

I have done some research on this and I remember reading
*someplace* that killing a particular NPC/named mob would
make it so that killing Gor Takus would make Shak Drathas
spawn in their place. But can't remember which one it was.
OTOH, I read just last night that it's a matter of killing
Gor Takus for an hour or more will make the Shak Drathas
spawn in their place for an hour or two then it goes back
to Gor Takus spawning again, wash, rinse, repeat as needed.

I was just wondering if anyone had specific experience in
which way it actually was. :)
