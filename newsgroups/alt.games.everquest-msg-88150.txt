I used "copy con" the other day to whip out a quick autoexec for a guy.  He 
laughed quite hard when I told him I used to use that a lot in the -early- 
DOS days.

Then I told him to try coding assembler in Wylbur.  His reply:

"You mean, like, you did assembler on a mainframe in a line editor?"  Uh, 
yeah.  At least it wasn't punchcards.

I wonder how many people have killed themselves after tripping and dropping 
non-rubberbanded final projects in punchcard form.
