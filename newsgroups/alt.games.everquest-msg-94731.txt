Emotional topic being covered in about 100 threads. It's individual.
Personally, I love the top druids in a group, where no cleric is
needed because all tanks are also well equipped etc. Druids can group
regrowth, POTG (one of my favorites) and do the occasional healing,
snare etc.. quite nice.

In the 45 - 50ies levels, where tanks are underequipped etc, I prefer
a cleric for the healing, because druids hardly managed when I was in
DL etc

But hey, there could be 100 of examples, where DL worked super nice
with a druid whatever... this depends on SO many factors. I normally
go for standard groups of cleric, chanter, tanks and a shaman (me),
simply because this *always* works, unless the people are stupid :)
