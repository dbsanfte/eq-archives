Not that I'm aware of but if anywhere has it, www.everquestlive.com does.

I can tell you a couple things now.

- If the name has "Zek" in it, it's a PK server.  I think Sullon Zek = no PK
rules at all
- Firiona Vie is the RP server and one I wouldn't recommend to anyone new to
the game (the way they crippled a lot of things may be fun to some people,
but serious obstacles for newbies)
- All other servers are old enough that "relative age" is pretty moot.

> 2.  Will the game work with Celeron systems?

EQ supports Celeron.  See the above link for requirements.
