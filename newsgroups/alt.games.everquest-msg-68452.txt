 Once again SoL requires everyone including those that don't
have SoL to update. These update effectively block some
paying people out. now if you've paid for a service and then it was
sudenly denied to you unless you paid out more money wouldn't you want
a refund? And don't start the 'Win 95 is obsolete' or 'This is what
happens and is expected with computers' excuses. Win 95 works fine and
will for days to come. Just check out MS website. MSDos 6.22 and
Windows 3.1 are no longer being supported 1 month AFTER support
ended for 95 did. Who uses either of those anymore?

Depends the stores policy returns on opened and used software.

 If you want to get Sony's attention a boycott would do it and IS
realistic, only problem is you would need quite a few people to write
in or sign a petion.
