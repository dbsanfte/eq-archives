First off ask your Attorney.
They would tell you to put it in a trust ( trusts are not as easy to
contest )
Then talk to to a "Good" Financial planner
They would tell you about setting up a "CRAT" or charitable remainder
annuity trust where you can set it up where the charity gets their lump
sum but promises to pay the children an income for their life. The benefit
to the estate is that it gets a tax break ( not as much as it would by not
providing an income )  but the kids cannot outlive the money and they can
play a part with their father's legacy.

A simple answer is that people who have that kind of money never rely on a
will by itself, so it doesn't matter. They would use ill revocable trusts,
Crat's, living trusts, life insurance and gifting money now to lower the
estate taxes. Otherwise half of that money goes to Uncle Sam.
