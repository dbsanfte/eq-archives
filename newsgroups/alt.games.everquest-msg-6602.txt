I just upgraded to a new computer.. buying a pre-configured system for the
first time in ages (probably since my first computer, a lovely 1988 model
286 with 512K of RAM and a 40MB hard drive). Anyhow, this Dell system came
with a SoundBlaster Live of some sort.. just logged into test to make sure
that EQ runs okay.. and BOY is the sound a lot better!  I was using a SB
card that was a few years old, but apparently it was way outdated. The music
was better (haha) and the sound effects much more realistic. So, if anyone
out there is running an old sound card, you might be pleasantly surprised
what an upgrade can do for the game.

I'm psyched to play for real when the servers come back up.. my monk is 3.5
yellow bubbles into her first hell level and I want to get OUT! :-)

PS - Flying kick for 52dmg ROCKS! :-)

PPS - I'm also interested to find out if there is a noticeable difference in
256MB of RAM vs. the 128MB on my old system. Also, PIII 1Ghz vs 550Mhz, but
I don't know if that will have much of an effect.
