Silvery belt comes from Kael.

Haste > all

If you're the tank, and I assume you will be, then you want the haste to
keep aggro and regain aggro off the casters.  If you're not the tank, you're
a pitiful damage-dealing warrior and you *need* that haste to keep from
being outdamaged by ...  everybody.

You do need to worry about AC and HP, both of which you lose a large amount
of making the choice you give.  I would suggest exploring different options
to try and minimize the impact getting haste has on your HP/AC.  Silver
chitin handwraps and that belt might be a better option than fbss and cobalt
gauntlets, for instance.  The Silvery belt is a good option, but pretty
rare and even more rarely sold, so you'd probably have to pay a premium or
go to Kael with a raid to pick one up.
