Once in EC there was some Erudite magician who was fighting stuff.
First he shouts something about "(whatever mob) to tunnel, please
help!", presumably because he got more than he could handle. I'm
guessing the higher level people hanging around selling stuff did help
him because he didn't die.  Then about a minute later, he shouts
again, "Zombie to tunnel, please help!".  (short pause) "but don't
kill the giant beetle!"  I think I finally said, "If you're gonna be
dragging stuff to the tunnel, the people there will kill both if they
want to!"
