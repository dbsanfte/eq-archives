Oh I dunno... I think every server had ridiculous flagging sessions...

A guild just killed Behom for the first time, 372 people flagged for
Tactics - wtf is up with that?
A guild who's already killed RZtW had members in the various tier zones
/shouting for people to head to PoI ASAP to get a tactics flag.   Pretty
gimp, cuz im sure the guilds "flag the world" policy is just a measure to
slow down everybody elses progress (lots more blown triggers and mob
competition etc)

Thats a massive nerf to raids, I guess I over-looked it at first, any mob
that camps corpses effectively means you're raid is CRing to the zoneline.
Thats pretty fuckin harsh after 5+ hours of clearing though a zones
"amazing" content...
