I would read this to mean that they only made changes that they felt
were needed. The real question is whether or not the cloth/leather
classes are directly linked. In other words, does boosting Monk
mitigation also boost Druid and BST? I don't think any of us can
answer that question. My guess is that they are partially linked, and
that monks are on a different mitigation table.

Only if all leather classes share the same code. "Changes as
appropriate" could also mean that BST and Druids were not changed at
all.

I have played a Monk to 53 and a BST to 44. I don't remember exactly
when the "monk mitigation" nerf went into effect (I had retired my
monk by then, but I did log him in to test the changes). With my monk
I noticed a HUGE change (for the worse) in tanking ablility. With my
BST I didn't notice much if any difference. Unfortunately you can't
really compare the two. With my warder I can back out of a fight to
bandage and heal or play pet cleric, so I am not sure I would have
noticed if the "nerf" effected BST mitigation.

>Any input is appreciated!!

My prediction....

1. Monks will notice a small/slight improvement unless they are
"uber-equiped" (eg top 5%)

2. Druids and BSTs won't notice any change at all.
