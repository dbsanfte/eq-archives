Having a blast with my mage. I can still hit the mobs with my nukes and pet
is still hitting things so most of the time the group I'm in is the KS/exp
group of a raid :)

Might change when we are ready to actually hunt bigger game then triggered
Feydedars or Kael Arena, but for now I love my char and get a chuckle when I
can KS a mob solo against a full guildiegroup of other classes.
