Well, as I continue to level up my bard, it seems that I'm always finding
new ways to put things together. I find songs that I ignored to begin with
for some reason become truly valuable later one when I can twist them with
another song that comes or when I just plain become just a tad less of a
noob and get a clue about their usefulness.

I'm currently of the 34th Song (which is a funny way of putting it since
there is actually something like 39 songs by this level), and, since you
rarely see more than one bard in a group, and my guild has only one higher
level bard (who isn't on that much), I find that I'm having to make my own
way in learning and reading what I can (EQDiva is great, but increasingly
out of date). With this in mind, I'd like to get some feedback on what
different bards are using in what situation around my level and somewhat
above.

Currently, my song list has about 4-5 songs that are pretty much always
memmed, and 3-4 that change out depending on what I'm fighting, if I'm
soloing or grouping, and what other classes are in my group (if I'm
grouped).

When by myself, it usually looks something like:

Brusco's or Chant (30)
Screech (fear)
Jonathan's Whistling Wartune (better haste/str, but just for me)
Chain (Snare/slow)
Selo's (speed)
Hymn (Healing)
Lull (for crowd control to give me time to run if needed)
Charm

If I happen to have SOW, I'll sometimes change out Selo's for any one of a
number of things

If I'm grouped, it usually looks something like:

Brusco's or Chant (30)
Screech (fear) or Group Haste/str (8 I think)
Mana
Chain (Snare/slow)
Selo's (speed) (sometimes gone for Haste if I have SOW)
Hymn (Healing) (sometimes gone for Haste if I have good healers, or for a
knock back and debuff song to address enemy casters that resist)
Lull (for crowd control to give me time to run if needed)
Charm

My tendency is to melee even when with groups. I usually have the casters
sit close enought o still mana charge while I'm fighting, then will paly
mana song or a fight related song as appropriate to the situation of the
moment. I haven't had occasion yet since I got Cantana, but I may sit back
with that in full groups that have enough melee so I can play my lute.

I'm curioius what others use and why. What strategies do people use to when
soloing and in groups? For soloing, I usually fear kite if just one, charm
and set them against each other (charm kiting?) if two, and try and stay
away from 3 unless I'm sure I can single pull.

Feedback?

Thanks
