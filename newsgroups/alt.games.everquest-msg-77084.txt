Wouldn't know.
Never really bothered to explore what Trueshot would do with DEX
buffs, since the only time we really "needed" Trueshot was in ST
against Ventani.  He's dead so, it's not an issue anymore.  :)

On the otherhand, for warriors using proccing weapons, I have more
than enough data that pretty much blows to hell and back the idea that
DEX plays a critical role in the proc rates.
