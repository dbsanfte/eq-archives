Hi guys.  I was wondering if anyone knew a name of a green BP useable by
bards, BESIDES Singing Steel.  I saw this one bard I was grouped with, level
26, that had one.  It looked a lot like the SS BP.  I looked again, and the
shade was very slightly off with the SS boots she was wearing.  I forget the
name of it though, any ideas?  Also, she had an arms item equiped that again
looked like SS, but wasn't. cheeky..

I just have a bard and I figure it would be nice to run around looking like
I have the SS BP ;)
