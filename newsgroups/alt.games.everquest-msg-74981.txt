Hi all!

I choosed 1 month subscribtion (around 9$ to pay each month) and started to
play everquest wich is well, well, to my eyes, quite interesting but not so
amazing (compared to Anarchy online...sorry guys!). i would like to stop my
subscription, someone knows how? do i have to 'cancel account' ? will i pay
the two days i played or will I pay 1 full month? (so i can keep playing
until end of the month)

thanx a lot for your help!
