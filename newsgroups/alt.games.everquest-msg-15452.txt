}Amusing? How so? How do you pronounce "NSA" or "CIA"?

I don't.  Pronouncability is not tied to my definition of a word.

}Yes, last I checked, NATO was pronounced "Nay-toe". How is this
}relevant to whether or not the previous are words/acronyms?

Are you then going to tell me NATO is not an acronym?

}>From the same dictionary:
}>
}>Main Entry: 1word
}>Pronunciation: 'w&rd
}>Function: noun
}>Etymology: Middle English, from Old English; akin to
}>Old High German wort word, Latin verbum, Greek
}>eirein to say, speak, Hittite weriya- to call, name
}>Date: before 12th century

}
}Where'd you get your definition? 

Note, above, where I said "from the same dictionary".  Meaning, of course, 
from the same dictionary that provided the definition for acronym in which 
you got hung up on their description of acronyms as necessarily being 
words.  To be specific, Merriam-Webster, at www.m-w.com .

}www.dictionary.com :
}word (wï¿½rd)
}n. 
}1. A sound or a combination of sounds, or its representation in
}writing or printing, that symbolizes and communicates a meaning and
}may consist of a single morpheme or of a combination of morphemes. 

Yes.  You really need to scroll down that page.

word n 1: a unit of language that native speakers can identify; "words are 
the blocks from which sentences are made"

Note the complete lack of reference to pronouncability.
