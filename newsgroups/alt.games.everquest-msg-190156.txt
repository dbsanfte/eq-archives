I understand the risks, but I think you aren't seeing the implications. 
What transpires here is that if war *can* be avoided with a country that *
does* have weapons of mass destruction and is ruled by a dictator at 
least an order of magnitude more psychotic than Saddam (and with even 
less regard for its own population), then there was no legitimate reason 
in the first place to go to war with Iraq.

Well, I don't remember us reaching agreement on what this war is *really* 
about. :) Anyway, this war is likely to be counter-productive on both 
the terrorism and nuclear proliferation fronts. Iraq wasn't a big 
supporter of international terrorism, at least nowhere near as much as 
nominal US "allies" such as Saudi Arabia are, but the war will certainly 
help radicalize existing anti-western positions. And as for nukes, it 
will have the *opposite* effect as intended, because it sends the 
message to the world that only nations with nuclear weapons are safe. 
Now *everybody* is going to start trying to obtain them... Are the US 
going to invade them all to stop it? The fact that the US appears to be 
happy for Israel to have nuclear weapons, but will throw a hissy fit 
whenever an Arab nation tries to get them will also do little to improve 
the popularity of the US in the area.
