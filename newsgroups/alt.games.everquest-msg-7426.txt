Before addressing this, could I prevail on you yet again to turn off the
html in your replies, please?
Oasis is far from the best you can do at 19. The crocs are starting to
green out on you, when you can find any in the crowded hell hole.  Head
on over to High hold pass and fight in the orc groups for a couple
levels, then into the keep. Or, if you aren't sickened by the idea, you
can go do the windmill in LoIO for many levels to come.
