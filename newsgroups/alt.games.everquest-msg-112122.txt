There is another method I find fun even if it is extremely narrow. Just find
the wildest ass undercon animal in an area, like something that -seems-
about 10 levels above what it cons, and charm that. Something like a
griffawn who I think go down to about level 12 or 14 will wipe out the
entire Mucktail Gnoll camp or take Broon down.

It's a little late for me to use this for experience but still a bit of fun.
