Market works for even vital services , something that appalls those who
would prefer to believe in socialism. Consider an imminent hurricane and a
gas station. Most other gas stations get out of dodge to protect themselves
but this particular owner stays and jacks up the price to $10 a gallon of
gas . Almost a perfect example of greed the socialists would say. If he was
not there then the poor people to low on gas could not leave the area and be
safe, for a mere $20 for just enough gas to get out of danger they live
instead of die. There is only one gas station open so that if he sold at
regular price he would quicly run out of gas as everyone topped of their
tank leaving and people would also die trying to leave with no gas.

Goverment inteference in the free market in that situation can only cause
problems. They make it illegal to jack the price up and bad stuff happens.
Its not worth the danger so maybe he closes and evacuates with the rest of
the people leaving all those poor people with no gas to die. Even if he is a
nice man and stays open to help others (rare indeed) he sells out of gas and
still leaves poor people behind. The free market gets everyone out and
goverment controls to protect us from gougers kill people .
