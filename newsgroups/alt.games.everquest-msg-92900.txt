I have an AMD Thunderbird 1900+ with 256MB of PC2400 (plan to buy an extra
stick of 256 2400 this friday - PAYCHECK =) and 'am using a Voodoo 5 5500
that is still kicking it pretty well! + my Cox High Speed Cable connection
and Soundblaster Live! Platinum. I run everything at its highest at 1280x
and it's smooooth

For you I think you need a new processor.
