I'll vouch on Intimidation working somewhat reliablely at above 150.  At
least that's when it started working on my rogue.  Without a snare effect,
it is pretty dangerous in most zones to intimidate, though I was able to do
it in Great Divide with relative safety when I soloed there.

Don't rely on it to save you though.  It doesn't work that consistently.
