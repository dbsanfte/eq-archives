    Gah :( I got to the thread too late :(

    I feel so left out I gotta post anyway!

    Go with the SK. I've now got a 61SK, and I regularly duo with a 60
shammy, and it absolutely craps on every group I've had in the game. PoP
zones are quite doable - in our mid to late 50's we were in plane of
nightmares getting incredible experience, and with veksar, PoD and PoV
accessable now, I can see us duoing all the way to the top.

    In fact, our duo is so successful we generally end up with people from
both our guilds (We're in different guilds) joining the group, and we often
become a 6 person duo these days <g>

    Only thing is: Be prepared to spend money like it grows on trees. That
SK's gear needs to be good - you can't skimp on DPS in a two person group,
and he's got to tank well enough to cope with a shammy's lesser healing, and
have enough hitpoints to survive when slow gets resisted...... twice. Shammy
gear isn't cheap either, and their spells cost a mint at the higher levels
:(

    The flipside is, with that team once you get up there, you can *make* a
lot of money too. And it's a *cool* duo... I could write half a book on all
the ways it fits together so perfectly.

Cheers,
James
