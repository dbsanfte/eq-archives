I have a question on EQ2 is it a game push like eq where endgame is to be time
enabled i mean im sure theres a endgame idea but is it and harsh as eq?
in eq where all guilds push to be elemental and time flagged whats it like with
eq2?

also how is death handled? and do you lose your corpse and all your belongings
and had to go to place you died to reloot yourself or what?
