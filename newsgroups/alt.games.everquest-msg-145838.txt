	I actually began to believe that Verant wouldn't do anything as stupid as
some of the things they've done in the past, but they did.

	HEY DIMWITS:  by taking away our ability to solo effectively, you just
forced MORE people into LESS space than before.  Since you ALREADY didn't have

what you had to do.

BYOG to overcrowded, but the room-temperature IQ crowd from Velk's is going to
go there and try to figure out how to fight in a real dungeon....
