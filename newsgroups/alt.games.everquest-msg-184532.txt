Adding RAM to 512MB would help a lot. You can also try turning off
some of the new character models to see if that helps speed up zoning.
I have a 56K modem and am able to run two accounts with it so a 28.8
connection should have no problem. I had to turn off the new character
models because of lag and zoning tho. Hope that helps.
