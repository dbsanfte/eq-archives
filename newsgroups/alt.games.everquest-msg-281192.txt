Yea that's what I'd suggest for the OP, they have genuinely made 
an effort to address the issues you mention. If the OP sees those 
as the game's major defects then its worth another look.

And there are plenty of casual guilds, I'm in one because that's 
the kind of player I am. If you can get onto the Najena server, 
look up Haabbes the paladin and remind me of this thread and I'll 
introduce you around.
