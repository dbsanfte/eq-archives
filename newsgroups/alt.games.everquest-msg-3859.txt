I prefer groups with a proper healer/tank balance. Too many tanks to
heal means more downtime, since everyone has to/should wait for the
healer. I've never tried examining how much my blows actually do
contribute, but it's rarely significant.  My melee hasn't made an
impact since my teens, when tank groupmates would ask me what I was
swinging and hitting for 25 with :)
That said, I love partnering. Exp rolls in and I usually get a chance
to work on melee/offensive spells without being mana drained. It's
also the only time my melee can be considered to make a impact, even
with a monk partner. (Good) monk partners rock.

What, my 521-with-heroic-bond AC? :)

I don't always get a chance to damage shield before the puller runs
off, I snare, and I occasionally nuke/dot. And then there's the adds,
who go straight for the sitting person :) 
In groups with 2 proper melee classes, I occasionally do manage to
draw the mob's attention when I hit it after snaring and DS'ing. I
might try to med between strikes sometime, though... even if it works
better with an even higher delay (like your beast), my 35 delay
weapons should give me time to back off and sit.

It's somewhat odd having a discussion on melee tactics for healers,
what with all the healers who don't even carry weapons after their
20s-30s :)

I remember you getting rid of that guy. Things work out for you (with
you being back and all)?
