I know the feeling.

Sitting in the bank I have a breastplate.  Anybody who wants can buy
it from me, only 10K.  Level 7, the first Giant Scarab I ever tried to
solo.  A long fight, a hard fight, and a dead Scarab.  And he dropped
the Pristine Carapace.  Healed up, back to town, got my Scarab
Breastplate.
