    SCM 1, 2, 3 right off the bat. The mana savings will make you gasp.
After that, if you want to be a raid cleric, Mass Group Buff. From there, a
lot of choice:

-Divine Arbitration is fun, and it saves lives.
-Healing Adept is useful now that we use Supernal Remedy more and more.
-one point in Mental Clarity is usually worth the cost
-Natural Durability - you're getting pounded on like never before, and the
extra HPs will come in handy. This one is also nice in that as your gear
gets better, it gets better.

    That's enough to keep you busy for a while. =) For reference, this is
what I got, in the order I got it:

Run 1, 5 points in WIS, Run 2, Run 3, SCM 1/Channeling 1/SCR 1/HA 1/HG 1/MC
1 (I wanted to see what each was like), SCM 2, SCM 3, ND 1, ND 2, ND 3, CA
1, HA 2, and I have 4 points saved towards HA 3. After HA 3 I plan to get
the PoP HA levels, then MGB if the guild needs it - right now I'm leaning on
the people that already have it and show up all the time. From there I plan
to max out CA and PoP CA, then either HG, Arbitration, or Combat Stability.
