It would be fine if raid exp at least balanced peoples exp bars out by the
end of the night.
As it is now, using /raid, if you die a few times, your down on exp.  3
deaths on a 6 hour raid and you'd still be behind on exp.

At least the old way you could put somebody in a KS group for 10 mins to get
their exp back
