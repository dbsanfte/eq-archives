I have been quad kiting Spirocs in TD for past couple days. I'd like to know
if anyone has experienced same weird bug (or feature) where one of your
flock gets suddenly teleported to its original spawn point. This has
happened to me twice now and it's pretty annoying when Spiroc has like 1 /
10th of its health left and it suddenly disappears and when I go check its
original spawn point it's there. This never happened to me with Ulthorks.
After recent patches and emergency fixes I thought if this is a new bug or
has this happened before those patches?
