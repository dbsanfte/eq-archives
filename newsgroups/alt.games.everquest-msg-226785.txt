OK after i read what i posted it does not make since to me either,lol.
I meant a system where u get points for showing up to raids and it is
kept track of on a webpage or somewhere.You can spend the points
that u get for showing up on raids for loot that drops. The last guild
i was in used a nbg/merit hybid but none of the regular peeps in the
guild had anyway to track who had what points and therefore there
was problems with it.

Thanks
