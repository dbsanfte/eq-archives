There are "legitimate RP reasons" for disallowing conversation

point being that your "legitimate RP reasons" argument is hopelessly
weak.

The spellbook is different at certain levels (pre-35 vs. 35+).
Not just a little bit different.  Radically different.  And you
seem happy with that.

I must assume by this comment you don't like the fact that the
spellbook scenario changes radically and drastically when you
level from 34 to 35?  Surely you should get better at paying
attention to your surroundings while meditating only slowly but
surely as you level?

I'm just pointing out that you dismiss one thing as unrealistic
and bad while accepting the same scenario in other parts of the
game.

It makes complete sense for multiple reasons.

1. Newbies are more likely to:
   A. Have more fun.
   B. Become less frustrated.
   C. Keep subscribing.

2. It doesn't change the *vast majority* of the game for the
   long-term players.

3. It makes alts more fun.  Those of us with alts already know
   the game mechanics.  We already know the kill bats/skeletons/
   rats/giant wasp drones/whatever drill.  It's a bore.  We
   want to play alts for variety and to experience another type
   of class.  1-10 doesn't give you any kind of feel for other
   types of classes.  It's pure drudgery for us.

Frankly, I'm excited about the alleged level 10 CR changes.
Now I can finally try lots of different race/class combinations
without it being quite so painfully boring and reptitious before
getting a feel for what that particular race/class combination
is all about.

The spellbook and CR changes have convinced me to keep my
account.  I was honestly on the verge of canceling my account
until some of these exciting changes hit the rumor mill.

: I don't think the changes are minor.  I don't like the changes from an

The RP argument is weak (see above) and the game play argument
is ignorable since 1-10 is a drop in the bucket compared to the
time you spend at 11-60.

Except that (not many) people agree with you that the changes
are significant from an RP or game play perspective.

: (excluding directly after release, because bugfixes and

: significant changes to travel, binding, death, resurrection, CR,
: experience, levels, death penalties, available characters, faction,
: and just about everything else.  These huge changes have come shortly
: after the departure of many of the people who were responsible for

Be careful with hero worship.

: Not all of these changes are bad, and in fact I

Except that (not many) people agree with you that the changes
will make the game significantly easier.

: In what way is this a non-sequitur?  We are discussing the merits of

: me.

I don't think you have any evidence that the spellbook keeps
the kids away.

: No, Verant did some initial tuning at the time that the FIRST players
: were getting to the point where death really was a pain.  I know my

Egads.  I'm sorry to hear you work with people like that.

Don't fear change.  :)
