No i don't get your point.  There have been plenty of additions mentioned
about beastlords, paladins, rangers, wizards, necromancers, etc.  All I was
asking is if anyone had heard anything about monks.  I never said that the
class was over/under balanced or that they "needed" something new.  I just
wanted to know if anyone had heard anything or seen anything.  So what was
your point?
