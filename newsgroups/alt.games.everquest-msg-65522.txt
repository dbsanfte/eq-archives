The city police took a very dim view to tennis cans, milk jugs, and other
assorted containers partially filled with gasoline being set off in empty
campus parking lots in the middle of the night too.  Used an M80 with the
fuse sticking out of the lid to ignite it.  It made for spectacular movie
special effect type fireball explosions.  Fortunately, they never actually
caught the culprits. :)
