I'd have to agree with this statement - my level 35 monk with two fighting
batons has consistently out-taunted most warriors I've grouped with. I don't
particularly like that fact, and have enjoyed the times when I wasn't the
one taking most of the damage! :-)  I'm not sure how the warriors were
equipped that I didn't taunt mobs off of - one fellow used to pull by
hitting the mob a few times with something like a weighted axe, and then was
dual-wielding two fast weapons. I imagine his taunt skill was maxed out as
well. But, when grouped with a warrior (or SK for that matter) using a 2HS,
the mob would usually stay on  me. And, I had the feeling that some off them
weren't trying to taunt at all.

I still prefer that there be a real "tank" in the group - I don't advertise
myself as one. I can't recall my hitpoints offhand, but my AC is in the
mid-700's now. I've read comments here that monks do and don't require more
healing - I personally "feel" like I require more healing, but that's just
subjected. All in all, I'd rather have a properly equipped, properly
taunting true "tank" in my group. Especially if the primary healer is not a
cleric. Nothing makes me MORE nervous than being the main tank in a group
with a druid as the primary healer. Nothing against druids, I'd just rather
have someone who's full time job for 30+ levels has been to heal. :-)

Kshaiku 35 Monk.. reluctant tank.. but I'll pull for ya non-stop and won't
