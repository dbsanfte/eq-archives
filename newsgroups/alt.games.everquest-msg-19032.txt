You almost hit the nail on the head. But to this guy, EQ *was* his life, and
it turned and bit him. To see through his eyes, pick something significant
in your own life (relationship, career, whatever) and imagine it doing the
dirty on you. Then imagine taking the extreme (and brave) decision to "cope"
with the event by destroying it in a fit of pique - in his case, cancelling
his account.

I'd like to imagine that this is catharsis for the guy, but unless he's
truly resolute and creates a new and more fulfilling life for himself, he'll
be back in a month.
