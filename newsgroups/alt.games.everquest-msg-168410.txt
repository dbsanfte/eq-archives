What do you base that on Ben? Inferring that I am a liar and would lie
on something so minor as a video game is rather insulting.  I've not had
any conversations with you in past so I'm a little purplexed as to why
you have this attitude.

I'll get back to Tim in the next day or two with my play time and
creation date for his own personal interest, whether you chose to read
the message or ignore it entirely is up to you.
