The first method is known as the poor mans gate.  You do risk exp loss
unless done as a duel.
The second method is doable, but it is better to go by day thrue Kithicor.
If you can's wait, from West Commons, take a sharp right turn, watch for
undead!!  Go as far up slope as you can and run like hell.  Best to have a
SoW and or Levitate if you can't get a invis vs undead.  It is doable
without these,  but scary as hell.
