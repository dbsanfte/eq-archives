   When Tealeef was around level 11 or 12, she tried to help a 
cleric, dunno the level, that got into trouble trying to solo
a corrupted woolly mammoth or something.  Of course, she got pounded
into jelly in very short order.  The cleric offered to rez her.
I declined.  "Why would do that?" Because, friend, it would take
less time for me to get the exp back than it would take you to
med up to regain the mana loss from casting the spell.

Annie <--Doesn't look for rezzes now, but doesn't turn them down,
         either.
