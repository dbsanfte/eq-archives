	It's common courtesy to put system downtimes in MOTD.  There's
no reason I should log in at 5am and find out that the servers are going
down in 3 minutes.  I shouldn't have to google for forums to find out
when a service I pay for is having yet another emergency downtime. Why
can they put the damn fan faire conventions in MOTD but can't put a notice
of downtime in even 2 hours beforehand?

	This is the same lack of professionalism on the part of the EQ
operations team that leads to situations like "We changed all the AA code
but didn't check to see if it really worked".  

	And putting up network status pages and updating them AFTER the
fact is just stupid.
