Only if you are overspending and failing to properly save for your future.
Unemployment pays 2/3rds what your last job did and lasts for a ridiculously
long time. Since a sound fiscal policy is to save a third of your income for
future emergencies , you should have enough to go through day to day
activities with relative ease for the emergency period.

People who live hand to mouth are particularly sad . Drive a older car ,
live in a slightly less affluent neighborhood , dont buy quite as much junk.
But whatever you do spend less then you earn. Save the rest for when you
NEED it.
