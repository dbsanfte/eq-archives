Below is a quote from http://necro.eqclasses.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=1453

It is apparently from Scott Hartsman (Tech director) and seems to
encourage hope that hell levels may be removed.

All from here down is quote :

Close -- the speaker was me. :)

I believe part of the answer may have been misunderstood, or maybe I
just phrased it poorly. 

"If we did make a change like this, we'd have to find a way for it not
to cause side effects to people's current exp."


Best,

Technical Director, EverQuest
