On MT they have been steady at 15pp ever since I have been there.  Is
that a ripoff?  Not to me.  On most servers it seems they run 30 to
40pp.  On MT the Backpacks run 50pp on others usually 100 from what I
have seen.  Proportionally it is the same.

I think in many respects it is how you promote yourself.  I am a
Fletcher/Bowyer at 203 and a lot of people say you cant really make
money at the skill.  I disagree.  I sell 2 to 3 Shaped Compound
Darkwood bows a week and make well over 10,000 arrows each month.  It
takes a lot more work but with my style of play I have plenty of time
to be a  Tradesman.
