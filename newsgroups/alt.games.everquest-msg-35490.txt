I just don't get this. What's the big deal? They are all items
in the game that are available to everyone. We all pay the same
fee to play the game.

Afraid to have someone notice that you are twinked or something?
Or that you are embarassed that your equipment is bad? Get over
it, nobody cares about twinking anymore, and if someone says anything
about your equipment just tell them to buzz off.

Personally I find it a good conversation starter and a way to meet people.
"Wow, where did you get that sword?" "What? This old thing? Got
it on a raid into..."

Why? Do you have something special or something that you don't
want others to see?

All inspecting does is give the name of the item anyway. So somebody may
be curious as to what gear you are wearing and may be the same class
you are and wants to know about a possible upgrade. So they inspect
you to get the name of the item to look it up later. What is wrong with that?

Personally I hate it when people ask me. Just look.
