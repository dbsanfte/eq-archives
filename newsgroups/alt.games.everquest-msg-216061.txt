*shrug*
A lot depends on what you fight, low blues don't stun you 1/10th as
often as something red to you.  The tougher the target, level-wise,
the more benefit that Ogre is gonna gain from his advantage.

He's still my highest level, and once again my most active character.
"Old" is just that, he's the oldest character on my oldest account.
And he is indeed upgrading his gear, but at L55 with Run2 I don't

lol.  Not a flame, but I disagree strongly.  What it says to me is:
"I don't actually have an opinion worth defending on this topic."
