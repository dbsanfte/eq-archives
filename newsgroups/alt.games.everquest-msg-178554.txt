There's a simple way to deal with most of the problem without needing any
additional computational resources: don't have the wandering mob paths go
through the buildings.  That wouldn't open up exploits, because the mobs
could still go through the walls if aggroed, but it would mean that
buildings would be safe spots as long as no one attacks mobs or trains mobs
to the buildings.
