That's actually the exact reason why I post under my real name, too.  Not
because I'm really much of a flame hound - although I can get my dander up
from time to time.  But I've seen *so* many people become *so* nasty and
abusive simply because the Internet gives them a measure of anonymity.  I
*don't* want that to happen to me, so I've made certain to hide nothing
about myself - I want to make sure that it's my own good name I'm dragging
in the mud every time I feel the urge to flame away.  =)
