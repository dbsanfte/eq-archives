It's got HP and STA, which means more HP.  The theory is that top warriors 
are so far above the AC softcap that HP are much more valuable.  Of course 
after comparing the stats on the Seru BP with my Vindi BP, I can say that 
Furor can suck my testicles.  I'm sorry, but in every way shape and form 
the Seru BP is an upgrade over the Vindi BP.  It has more AC, more HP, 
more STA, more STR, more resists, and even more fucking INT/WIS.  In 
addition, it has regen and an ATK boost.  Anyone bitching about this BP 
can drink a big ol' cup of Shut The Fuck Up.
