I have noticed that the mobs "recover" full hitpoints very soon after an
encounter with another player. Ie, someone beats a mob down to 10% and carks
it - the mob instantly heals fully again ready for the next encounter.

One thing I don't like is that you can't group mid encounter, there is no
way to help someone at all unless they break off the encounter altogether.
