Suffering from a bout of insomnia, I was on this morning at about 3:45
Central when they told us to get the hell out as they were dropping the
servers.  At about 8:30 this morning, I patched and got new versions of
eqgame.exe along with a host of other dlls and such.  Then when I got back
from lunch at about 1:00 the servers were down again ... I hit the patch
server and grabbed my second version of eqgame.exe of the day.

Ahhhh ... the nostalgia of the Luclin live .... ;-)
