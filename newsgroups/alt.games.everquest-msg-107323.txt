Lay some subtle hints about like 

/ooc Sorry, I'm not breezing or buffing anyone because I'm saving my
mana for THE GROUP that I am hoping takes me in. Once I'm in a group
and we are killing stuff it is assumed that I will BREEZE all the time
then for THAT GROUP to be named later, NUDGE NUDGE.

okay, that is not very subtle but still... ;)

? Not much to group in on Crushbone by the time you have breeze, is
there? Isn't it level 19 or something or is it lower?

Ahaha they "schooled" you but it will cost them later. Idiots. 
They knew you were 16 when ou said it and they asked for breeze and
haste, duh. Why do they think 16 is too low? At 16 you can gain xp
still with a .... level 24. I'm kind of doubting they'd be over 24 in
the lake.

This was your clue though:

"Milochytin tells you: u may join us at front door"

That is when you reply, "Sorry, but I'll only group with someone who
types well enough that the extra two letters are automatic."
At that point they will say,

"What do u meen?" 
which is more of a clue.

Aahha.

Those guys are stupid. Why do they care if you were too low anyway?
They can USE you getting breeze and haste while you are there hanging
out. If they were smart they would have done that and let YOU discover
you were not getting xp (if that was even the case, I bet you would
have)
