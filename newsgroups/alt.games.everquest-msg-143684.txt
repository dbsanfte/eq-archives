Not in the US, it isn't.  Punishment can be affected by
a multitude of special circumstances.

Okay, it's a "specific crime," then.  Or whatever you want to
call it.  Some hate crime law allows a person to be charged with
committing a hate crime.  That's not an "ordinary crime."  That's
a specific crime determined by motive.  It would be like calling
an "ordinary" robbery a "greed crime" unless they did it just
because they were bored, in which case it would be a "boredom
crime" and so on.  The US doesn't seperate out any crime by
motive, at least that I can think of off-hand.  I don't see any
need to start, either.

Commission of a crime, of course.  But laws don't deter
motive and, IMO, shouldn't.  It's "okay," for instance,
to be greedy.  It's "not okay" to defraud people because
of that greed.  And, at least in the US, it's perfectly
legal to hate a subset of people.  Laws aren't going to
get rid of it and it's stupid to try to legislate it, IMO.

> Don't all crime require some degree of intent?

No, some crimes are crimes of omission, not commission.
But that's not on point... ;)

Hrmm.  Maybe my example wasn't clear enough.  A KKK member is in his
own bed and hears a window break.  He goes downstairs with his gun,
sees an African-American climbing through the window and shoots him.
In various parts of the US, doing that can result in either being
charged with murder (you can't kill someone unless there's imminent
physical danger to yourself) or a medal (anyone breaking into a house
gets what they deserve.)

But, no, IMO, that's NOT for a jury to decide on a hate crime basis.
He didn't seek out the person to kill.  Although he might be more
likely to shoot an African-American purely out of spite, it's simply
not relevant because it's not proveable.

I do, because I can see where people would convict out of their
own intolerance for socially unpopular views.

And, as I've said, that doesn't require any new "hate crime" law.
That's a different, "special circumstances law" that can easily
be added as a topic for introduction during sentencing.

"Did the person murder someone else?" should be the ONLY consideration
when someone is on trial for murder.  The facts of how they picked
their victim or why are irrelevant except as it proves motive.  And
introduction of those facts is legal as the law stands today.
