Most species of cat are solitary animals (lions being one notable
exception), dogs are pack animals.  I suspect dogs view abusive masters the
same way they would the Alpha in a pack of feral dogs.  That is to say, it
values the pack it sees itself belonging to more than its own well being.
Abused women, especially those with children, often succumb to the same
instinct -- we humans are pack animals too.  This does not, by any stretch
of the imagination, make the abused women or the abused dogs stupid.
