KDS is inconsistent.  Most of their stuff is pretty good, but (like with
anyone) there are occasional quality control issues or bad models.  I'd
look for reviews first.

That said, I probably wouldn't mail-order a large monitor.  Shipping
tends to counterbalance most of your savings, for one, and minute
geometry issues become much less minute at those sizes, for two.  I'd buy
from somewhere where I can take the monitor back if I just can't get the
image straight.
