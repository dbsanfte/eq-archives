The thing that did in smithing was the rise in drop rates for the 
Ornamental armor.  It totally destroyed the market for most cultural 
smithing, which was the big money maker for smiths.

The high end pottery can still be useful, but, a lot of it has been 
supplanted by that same ornamental armor.

As for midrange tradeskill items, there has not been a real market for 
that stuff for a very long time now, other than items that are used for 
skilling up.  A lot of people are busy skilling up in multiple 
tradeskills for the Aid Grimmel quests.  This means that intermediate 
step items sell well, and that a person wanting to skillup for the sake 
of GMing a tradeskill is going to find prices on those intermediate items 
higher than they have been.

Basically, it seems like SoE introduced all sorts of cool new tradeskill 
items, then, after a while pulled the rug out from under all the people 
who worked so hard to get to the point of being able to make them.
