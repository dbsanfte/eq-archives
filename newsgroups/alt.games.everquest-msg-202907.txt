<<<<<I've only been playing for a month and was unaware that KEI was a "bug".
My
17 Druid found out about KEI at lev 10, and since he solos most of the time,
he thought it was very nice. The four plains of Karana are a great place for
a Druid in his/her teens, jacked up on KEI. On Prexus at least, the plains
are almost always empty of other players and loaded with all levels of MOBs.
It was a great deal of fun romping around practicing my Druid skills and
tactics. Last night I got on and found out the party is over. My beloved 17
Druid is boring as hell. I don't normally have the tv on when I'm playing
but last night I did and needed it because my Druid spent a great deal of
time on his butt.

I'm putting him away today and starting a new char, one with grouping
potential since low lev Druids have very little if any.  Maybe and
Enchanter. Anyway, I still have two months to go on a three month access
card. I haven't decided if I'm going to get another card or just take the
game off my box. I don't pay sony to watch tv, that's what I pay the cable
company for.

From reading the posts here I'm sure that a lot of you will be saying  to me
"good bye, good riddance." And in all fairness, perhaps I do have a short
attention span, and I need a game that provides a lot of stimulation in
order the keep me interested. And if it turns out that 50% of EQ gameplay is
sitting on your butt waiting to med, than this is definitely not the game
for me and I will take my money and go play someplace else.

One last point, I've been reading a lot of post blabbing about "the old
days". I just want to say I Don't Care About The Old Days!!!!! The game I
signed on to and pay for is not "the old days" game. When I was a child my
parents used to bore me with stories about walking to school in mile high
snow with no shoes on, etc. etc.. I didn't care then and I don't care now.

That stinks.  I'm sure you were having fun and not bothering anyone but the
whining morons who didn't have KEI when they were leveling up don't want you to
have it now.  You'll find that the game is a lot of sitting on your butt and
watching TV and or reading.  You're gonna quit.
