Ha! Maybe I do read too much, you're right. I do think Trolls are cool 
and I like alligators a lot. I had one (stuffed the poor little guy) as 
a kid. At one point I was looking into a Troll SK. Hmmm, an ugly badass 
Troll does sound like fun. I'll have to think about that! I also thought 
the Ogre with the bear sounded very fun too. I'd call the bear Pooh, 
sucky roleplayer that I am sometimes...
