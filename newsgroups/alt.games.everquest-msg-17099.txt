FWIW, I play a shaman and when someone asks for SOW, I frequently inspect
first to see if the person is naked, in which case I provide it for free,
usually along with other buffs, or fully equipped, in which case I ask for a
donation.

And, a bit off topic, but related to my own comment, what is it with
Paladins??? Almost everyone who wants SOW is at least semi-polite and
donates a reasonable amount for their level. Except paladins. Was in High
Keep at the bank and some lvl 35 paladin, loaded with gear, wanted a SOW. I
said, yes, for a donation. He gave me 2 gp. Could he freaking SPARE IT??!!
Then the other day, about to make a run through Kithicor Woods, some
paladin, level 30+ , comes up and wants to know if anyone can SOW. I reply
yes, for a donation. He makes some rude comment, then says, "c'mon, c'mon"
while I'm switching spells. I play a shaman because I like helping others
and I like the mix of casting and fighting, but this kind of behavior is a
real turn-off. And it has only happened to me from paladins. Which I feel is
weird because, with anything remotely resembling roleplay, they're supposed
to be chivalrous. I'm seriously considering routinely refusing paladins, and
making the comment that "your gods are not mine. I won't help you." Oddly,
clerics are exactly the opposite, as are enchanters, in general. They ask
politely and typically provide a buff in addition to SOW; I usually buff
them with everything I've got when that happens.

Just my 2 cents.
