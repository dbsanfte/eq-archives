Is this really the best that the mob could offer?

1. Did any of you bother to ask how old Matt was?
2. Did any of you actually debate the subject at hand with him...or did you
just see that he used the word "fuck" and piled on like the bottom feeders
that you are?
3. Is anyone willing to hash out this debate at this point...or are you all
going to stand there drooling on each other like a bunch of special ed
students patting each other on the back and replying like Beavis and
Butthead... "huh huh...good one Beavis...you told him....my turn now...huh
huh huh...he said "fuck""
4. Are any of you going to come to terms that your single sentence responses
equal, by your own admission, that you LOST the war... (I'm sure I could
easily dig up the post where someone stated that about Matt).

To think I actually came to the rescue of this NG once and rid you of
someone like Avenger...

Ps. Matt is young...he's also in my guild and I've met him in real life.
He's got a hot head sometimes but mostly he's a great guy. I'm sure you're
all damned proud that you could all manage to gather your resources and as
one huge mob, call him names and repeatedly tell him you have him KF'd. It
amazes me how so many of you can scream out how immature people are
acting...when you yourselves are acting like nothing but a bunch of
teenagers.

I mean look at these garbage responses...this is about as lame as it gets...

I don't need to use foul language to make you look like complete
idiots...you've all managed to accomplish this task entirely on your own.
