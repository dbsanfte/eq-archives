I was in a raid in Lower Guk hunting the Fabled Frenied Ghoul. About 3
hours after I joined *Trazum* joins follwed by *Aniema* minutes later.
Everything was fine, no problems with people taking the loot out of
turn, until it was my turn. We killed the FFG and were finishing off
the adds. I then went to loot the FFG to get the sash but found that
Aniema was already looting the corpse out of turn. Then Trazum came
over, Aniema stood up, and Trazum looted the sash. Then Trazum stepped
back and logged out. I had to leave I was so furious. The raid leader
said they are filing a /petition and I should as well. I did when I
got to the PoK. I mentioned the incident in /ooc and 2 people said
they had also been 'ninja looted' by Trazum.

The annoying thng is they were next after me but I guess they couldn't
wait. So no sash for me and positive reinforcement for negative
behaviour by Soe. 

If nothing else keep an eye out for these two on Bertoxous, it could
be youe loot they take next.
