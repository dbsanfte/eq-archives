Sorry if this is a dumb question, but my assumption of "aggro kiting"
is that it's a technique a pet-playing class uses where player pulls
the mob and mob attacks player, then player steps back and lets pet
fight mob, then moves back in again and has mob switch aggro back to
player again (in other words, have mob keep switching aggro between
player and pet).  Am I correct?

Thanks in advance,
