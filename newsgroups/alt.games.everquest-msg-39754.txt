My friend is a related issue.  Anytime he starts to mem a spell, the packets
start dropping and he goes LD.  He can med, and cast, etc, but he just can't
mem.  He's on a modem right now until his Cable Modem gets installed.  I
told him to play a warrior until then, but, if you are having somewhat
related problems, the Cable Modem may not fix it for him ( assuming you
aren't on a modem ).
