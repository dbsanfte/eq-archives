Don't know if this is related but tonight I locked up zoning from bazaar to
nexus and when I finally got back in an hour later I was back in my stall
with both vendor satchels in inventory.  The bazaar was emptied.  Apparently
there was a server crash or something.  A guildie reported she lost an item
because she happened to be looting her corpse when it crashed.  She did get
it back.
