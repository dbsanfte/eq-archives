Actually, just about all the regular mobs in there drop pieces for the
shaman epic.  There is one of the 6 pages that only drops off the Spectral
Courier in the stable, the other 5 pages are random drops off pretty much
any mob.  I have spent a lot of time in there, so I am quite certain of the
5 pages, the 6th one is from reading up on it, and I have not seen it yet
(Student's Log).  I have only been with a group that killed the Courier
once, and he did not drop it that time.  There is also a floor spawn for the
shaman epic, inside the building near the courtyard that is to the right
after entering.  The other drops needed for the shaman epic, come off of the
3 lords that only spawn after Black Reavers are killed.  You won't be doing
the reavers at your level range.

Definitely don't use AoE spells.  Also, never attack anything that does not
aggro on you, there is a phantom goo that is really way up above you, but
sometimes appears to be at your level.  If you attack it, you will likely
bring every mob in the zone down on you, and you will die.
