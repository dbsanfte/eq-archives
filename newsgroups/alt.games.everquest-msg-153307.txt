This one time, my guild rushed to kill a named mob
without buffing or setting up a CHeal rotation or setting
groups or anything...why, you ask?

Somewhere, off in the breeze, we saw:

Deputy Asler says,"Time to die, Rumblecrush!"
Deputy Keld says, "Time to die, Rumblecrush!"

Apparantly, they'd followed one of our druids from
Misty all the way to the moon, stopping and KS'ing
all of her mobs on the way...
