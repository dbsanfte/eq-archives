I agree so far.

How does this rule give them more enjoyment?
The only way you can argue this give them more enjoyment is if you
also argue that high level players were somehow stopping low level
players from doing these quests and getting these items. Because
that's what the TCC does, is stop high levels. That's all it does.

If that's what your arguing then there is the Play Nice policy already
in place to deal with these (to me seems to be remarkably rare)
events. So this code, doesn't provide any extra benefit,except that it
requires a farmer to use a lower level to assist, basically forcing
the high level to buy batwings for 4 plat instead of allowing them to
get their own.

Typical newbie is in game only a few hours before being twinked. Since
items have a huge benefit on ability especially at low levels, this
means the newbie is directly more capable then the old players were at
the same level.  The example of weapon ratios has already been given
in another post.  I still remember my first newbie druid trying to get
patchwork armor, spending all his money on it. The last newbie I made
had better armor inside of an hour then my first did after a month of
playing. That is the eq no decay economy in action. There are
continually more and more items in the world and no natural decay thus
better and better equipment is available to newbies.

Hugely better? How? Are you saying that the level 50 to 60 changes
were an improvement? Are you kidding me? The boosting of Clerics
warriors and enchanters over all other classes, the extreme exp
requirements, every level in the high end game being a hell level. 

Why do you need the skeletons to drop runed totem staves when the
economy is already in rapid deflation?  Are you actually trying to
deny that most newbies these days have better equipment then they did
two years ago? Or are you trying to deny the huge benefit equipment
gives in eq?  Heck even in just the amount of newbie zones available
newbies are better off now. And the biggest benefit is information,
anyone can tell you for the asking the price of an item how to get
from a to b, etc.

Basically you want newbies to not have to go thru the newbie treadmill
we all went thru.  Again that is the game, I am not saying its good or
bad just that it is.

And you think the TCC fixes this? All this will do is make farming
require lower levels. It will not remove farming. And lets be honest
if your argument is about the indignity of getting handme downs then
what do you think the exp gained by farming to help a higher level is
all about?  It's not like the newbie can do the quests by himself. Not
without a hell of a lot of help.

They can do that anyway. We all did. What's stopping them?  Why should
lowbies get special treatment? A lowbie always has access to highbie
stuff simply by leveling up, but highbies are purposely restricted
from this content.  You don't see anything fundamentally unfair about
that?

Ahh yes the Rangers.  Hey what can I say I am a rules freak.  :-) 
To me this ruleset is unfair and I will not be buying luclin nor
setting foot in any TCC zone.  And I still don't think i was wrong
then either, I think we should have stuck to the plan, no drop armor
no loot weapons zerg attacks, no extras nothing to lose. An army of
green and brown.

My answer is simple, if they don't want a hand me down then they can
level up twink free like all the rest of us did in the olden days.
What's the problem? 

Oh but your not satisfied with the loot that drops of level one mobs.
You want level 10 loot on level 1 mobs. Well then what about level 10?
Will you want level 20 loot dropping off level 10 mobs? Follow the
chain up the ladder and guess what, the level 60's will then be
getting screwed unless level 70 loot drops of the level 60 mobs they
kill. And if level 70 loot drops off of level 60 mobs they are killing
then relatively speaking we are all exactly back where we started
except that the game has gotten easier. So maybe you should just cut
to the chase and admit you want an easier game with in game rewards
now instead of later.

beggars and hand me downs have nothing to do with game mechanics. EQ
has no item decay and has beggars, UO had item decay and had beggars.
No difference at all. As sure as the sun rises there will be people
playing at being females to get loot, people pretending they lost all
their stuff by being pked or in a technical glitch to get stuff, and
people who just flat out want to beg. It's human nature. 

The real solution to your perceived problem it seems to me is to make
every item in the game no drop.  That would remove both begging and
twinking and would force every player to go get their own stuff. 
Of course getting your own stuff again has nothing to do with the TCC,
which only prevents higher levels from getting stuff and does nothing
to help lower levels getting it. Unless they are being PL'ed as they
farm of course.

If I quit it will be more because of the abomination the new luclin
graphics represent then the tcc. Once luclin is released I will never
be the cute funny Sylverlokk the gnome anymore I will be a leering
Danny Devito'esque old man. I'd rather quit then have my avatar seen
that way.
