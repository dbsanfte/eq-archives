As you come up the stairs, if you open the door on the right, then yes, your
invis will be stripped, as well as all the other doors will open.
Simply running through the secret wall and back out into the graveyard won't
strip your invis.

I've always used just regular camo all through that area and never had any
trouble. I usually just drop off the coffin to see if the catliff is in the
room below, then back up the stairs and out. If the ushers and other casters
behind the other doors see thru regular invis, then I've not got close
enough to agro them.   The only time regular camo has betrayed me is near
and in the castle itself.
