As a general rule, no, don't keep warriors berserk.  (Only warriors
have this as a skill, by the way, although I've heard a couple
other tank types say they have berserked.  I bet they had
a bard in the group or something else giving a berserk message,
though)

If you have something happen so that you are distracted, that
tank you've been keeping berserk has the HP of a caster.

Tanks principle job in a group is not to -do- damage (which
berserk -will- help with) but to -absorb- damage.  Keeping
them LOHP means that if damage happens, they can't take
it.  This means that this trick is only useful when you -don't-
need them to tank!

If you are running CHeal, then you may be letting your tanks
get LOHP in order to get full value from your mana.  Assuming
you are good at your job, this is fine... and the fact that
warrior not only tend to have the highest HP and the highest
AC, but -also- benefit from Berserk while waiting for their CHeal
is a bonus.  Too, that "goes berserk" message makes a handy
timer, especially in big fights where HP bars sometimes get laggy.

There are some very controlled situtations out there, where you know
exactly what you are facing, are -sure- there will be no adds, know
quite well what the possible rate of damage your tank is facing will
be... in situations like this, especially if you -are- relying on tanks
to do most of the damage, Berserk can be a great tool.  Trick here
is to -not- heal your tank, maybe for a couple fights in a row, till
he finally gets down into your Berserk range, then use small heals
to keep him teetering there.  You'll find that the trigger to -go-
berserk happens at about 30%, but he'll -stay- berserk unless you
heal him up past about 50%.  To counteract the inefficiency of
your heals, he can practice Bind Wounds to charge back up
some between fights while staying berserk.  Hmm, need I mention
that if you are doing this the tank should be fully HP buffed to
the best of your ability?  Half of 3000 is a lot better than half
of 1500

See if you can get a ranger and warrior to go fear kiting frosties
with you, keep the warrior berserk and he just might give the
ranger a run for his money as far as main damage producer!
