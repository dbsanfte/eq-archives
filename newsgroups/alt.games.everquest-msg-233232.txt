Wolf form will still affect how you con.  I can say with absolute 
certainty that wolf form will still make you KOS to mobs that you are not 
KOS to without wolf form.  I am almost certain that I did use wolf form 
to get my enchanter spells from the brownies too, which was the standard 
practice, as it makes you non KOS to them.
