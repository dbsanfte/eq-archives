I've never had a horse, but I heard you used to be able to turn off the 
luclin models for your own race to partly fix this.  I really don't 
know, but that's what I heard.  Does shrink work?  Do you cast it on you 
or on your horse?

I haven't heard of any, though it makes sense to me that you should be 
able to get off the horse and then duck if it's really important.
