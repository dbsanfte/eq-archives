<top post corrected>

There is some truth to having to wait after moving prior to casting.  
Best way is to stop, and turn slightly immediately, then cast.  There can 
also be issues if you are casting on a slope sometimes.  In addition to 
that, if the mob was casting a spell with a stun or knockback component 
to it, that may interrupt your casting.
