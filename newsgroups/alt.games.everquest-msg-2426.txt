If you need money money to buyy spells (dirt cheap). And don't like =
begging or what not, I suggest making a barbarian shaman/rogue and =
heading down to the Ice giants in Everfrost. (if you don't know where =
these guys are go to eqmaps.com or eqatlas.com)  Follow the walls so you =
don't get hammerd by mobs btw. Then oince you get there be careful they =
will attack ya =3Dp Well this is how you make money... Ice Giants drop =
TONS of Plat/Gold/Siliver/Copper. And higher levels only can kill them =
so thye usually drop there gold/sliver/copper on the ground. Now.. the =
good thing for you is.. you are a barbarian you have TONS of strength so =
you can pull that heave load fromt he Ice Giants  back to your bank. =
Proubly will take a 3 hours but by the end of that time theroictly you =
should have about 100pp.  I have never actually done this before since I =
have a 59/wiz and had friens who gave me phat lewt =3Dp but this is =
something I though up of when I was bored. If  someone wants to go try =
this out. Please reply back to this of your findings.=20



P.S I didn't bother to re read this or what not... =3Dp=20
