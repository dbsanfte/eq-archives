Ok, if we have to work with numbers given and leave out all assumptions, we
can't answer the question.   You're also making assumptions, those yours are
less reasonable than mine.  Yours being that those 50-60 players are a
different set each time, mine being that they are largely the same (due to
the fact that's how you get to 50-60 by playing for extended periods, also
account sharing and so on).

You can stick with you belief if you want, but I've shown you why it's on
very thin ice.  You could, alternatively, step back and rethink you
position.  All a matter of if you're more interested in "winning" or in
understanding reality.  Your choice.
