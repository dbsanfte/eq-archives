I haven't been able to find any help on this from the usual sources.

A friend of mine has a Sony VAIO that she has just upgraded to 512Mb RAM.
When she turns the Luclin graphics on, everyone is naked. Has anyone seen
this before? Does anyone have Luclin graphics working on the 810 integrated
graphics?

The only reference I've found so far to this problem said it was solved by
adding more memory, but 512 is all this machine will hold - and it should be
enough.

Thanks
