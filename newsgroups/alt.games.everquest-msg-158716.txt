I did read some statement from Sony that the 5 new levels was not to be as
hard as levels in the last 50'ies..
Level 60 is a "half level", and i recon the 60-65 levels are somewhat half
levels as well.. BUT that said, the 60+ now needs to go to harder zones to
get any decent xp at all.. The low DB/light blue mobs they "used to" farm AA
points on, are now either green, or giving so little xp that it is not worth
it anymore..

I am of course one of the misfortunates that can only play 8 hours a day..
lol.. and i am far from being 60.. That said i have gotten the worst of all
levels there is..
When i started.. levels 1-10 was not a "1 hour speed xp thing" as it is
today, but regular levels with needed CR's and all.. Level 51 and 54 was a
hell level.. and i think i dinged 55 just when they "fixed" that.. causing
55 to be longer.. so i got 51 hell, 54 hell.. and a harder 55+ then it was
before.. Sux.. me thinks..

Btw.. "I" am at least FAR from dinging one level a week.. (perhaps if i did
some drugs to make everything look funny.. cos as of now.. i find 0 fun in
soloing the same old camp for the xp grind..)
