i wandered in one day as a 54 monk, saw him up, took a dozen screenshots,
laughed at a monk in my guild who spent 92 hours camping him, killed him,
and then just bought the MQ of targin's item

that's my trick for everything...wander through, make jokes, win

but seriously, don't spend all your time there...get an alt and use it to
check on him
