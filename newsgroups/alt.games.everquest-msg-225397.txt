What're your base stats again?  I think 55 STR, 102 INT and 90 CHA?

[My .02]

If it was me, I'd put 5 or 10 points into strength and the rest into INT.
My thoughts:

 - You have the highest base CHA and second lowest base INT for the
Enchanter races.  You can spare the 5-10 points of CHA, since....

 - ...CHA is cheap to raise these days, much cheaper than INT or STR.  Get a
couple of those +25 CHA steins and some cat's eye jewelry to switch to when
you need the boost.  Not to mention that almost no one wants CHA drops,
since only you and Bards need them.  (*Do* try to raise it, you *do* need
it, just not much as INT.)

 - You need every last point of INT you can get.  That's your whole mana
pool.  If you don't have mana for a mez, your CHA makes no difference.

 - And why strength?  'Cause 55 strength ain't much.  Granted you don't
*need* much, but that extra 5-10 can help.  My Enchanter carries around
changes of gear for various situations--extra MR for when I'm AE mezzing,
extra CHA for when I'm charming, heavy INT for when she's not mezzing, etc.
With such low strength (69 in gear and unbuffed) that can weigh her down,
even though all my bags are weight reducers (4 of them being 70% or better),
so having added the extra points has helped me out.  Given how cheap CHA can
be to raise, I'd rather sacrifice 5 or 10 charisma points up front for the
permanent strength.

[/My .02]

YMMV, especially the strength part.  I have the feeling I'm going to get
greatly disagreed with on that part, but it's worked great for me. :D
