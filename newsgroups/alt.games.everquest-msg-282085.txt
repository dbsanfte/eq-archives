Yes, EQ (or "EQ live" or "EQ1" or "Original EQ") is a different game, 
with different underlying assumptions, different mechanics, different 
class progressions, different ideas about how quests should be done and 
so on.

You can't take your EQ1 character and move him to EQ2, nor can you make 
pretty much the same character over again.

Its sort of like chess and checkers, if checkers had been named "chess 
2" in order to try and get chess players to try it out... and the 
similarities are along the same lines (both games share an 8x8 set of 
alternating red and black squares)

EQ1 is stronger than EQ2 these days, I think; it did lose quite a few 
people to EQ2, and even more to WoW, but it had already been hemoraging 
steadily and many of the people who defected returned to EQ1.  The real 
problem with EQ1 is that while its always lost people, recently its 
stopped getting in as many new people as it loses; think of it as a 
death rate and a birth rate, if people die but more people are born, 
then you have growth, if not, well, your population gradually shrinks.

The real damage EQ2 inflicted on EQ1 was exactly that; new players don't 
know that EQ1 and EQ2 are two seperate games with their own positives 
and negatives, and that some players are going to prefer one, some the 
other; by calling it "EQ2" they created the impression you have, which 
is that EQ1 is the old game and EQ2 the new one.  This isn't a case of 
Civ 1 being supplanted by Civ 2, and then by Civ 3, with a few diehards 
hanging on to Civ 2 because they didn't like the details of the change 
or because they are too cheap to buy the new one... but by calling it 
EQ2 they made it seem that way.  So, new players tend to try EQ2, if 
that turns out not to be the style they like, they move off to WoW or 
something instead of trying "outdated" EQ1.

Truth is, while there are certainly some outdated mechanics around in 
EQ, its really the most robust MMOG out there today, because its sitting 
on top of what, 10 expansions, each the equivalent of half a new games' 
worth of new material, plus three or four upgrades to the GUI, plus 
quite a few free mini expansions adding new zones or reworking old ones 
and so on; there's a lot more content there than any of the "new" MMOG's 
have, simply because they have been able to space them out a couple per 
year and have them pay for themselves by people buying the expansions in 
box over the years... while new players can get them all in 
combinations, someone trying to do the same work now in a single release 
wouldn't have any hope of getting the same $500 or so per copy of the game.

Anything else you buy (including EQ2) is going to have to be smaller, 
and yet more than half the players out there are former EQ players, so 
your new game is going to have a bunch of people seeing it as tiny by 
comparison.  Thats not to say they can't be better anyway... but thats 
because better is relative, the real question is which game style works 
better for you, there is no absolute "better" to it.
