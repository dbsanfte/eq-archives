Answers are based on my PoM experiences more than a year ago

> Can groups of raiders with good CoV faction pretty much just make it to
> the entrance? Or do you have to fight your way to it anyway?

You have to fight your way there as those mobs are not on any faction
and they don't drop anything either.
 
> What sort of faction hits, if any, do you incur there?

No faction hits at all. But to keep yourself safe, don't hail anything
inside PoM.

> What levels/classes would be a minimum for an exploratory raid there?

Consider yourself organizing a raid for the ToV Test Hall and that's
close. I will say 55 and up

> Any particular dangers, good spots, mobs, loot, etc. to be on the
> lookout for?

-Once zone in, invis yourself. There are traps in the garden that will
trigger KoS flowers.
-after you pass the garden, there is a invisible bridge that will lead
you into the building on your left handside. Prepare yourself to swim
as it's easy to fall down from the invised bridge.
-There is a debuff archdoor that will strip off all your buffs. Thus
to save yourself and others' mana, better avoid unnessary trips
between the Building and the garden
-It's better to have your casters to get bind at the door that leads
to the Theatre. As there might be unexpected trains to the hall from
the zone
-There is only one bind point in the PoM for the melees (is this still
valid?)
-Theatre is the best spot for camping exp and quest items then. But
the mobs take ages to kill. We used to have 2 groups killing in the
theatre. One group getting the exp, the other group was only
assisting. Well, actually, there was nothing but sight seeing once the
theatre got camped. All the other mobs not only take ages to kill but
also ages to respawn. Beware, you need to kill the theatre puppets in
a certain order or they will despawn. If i remembered correctly, you
have to start from the audience.
- There is a spectre that roams around. Don't hail him as it will DT
you. This is what my guild told me.
- Everthing that dropped in PoM is a quest item. They don't drop any
coins and gears. Thus you will probably end up with a full backpack of
otherwise usless junks (ARRGGGHH, that reminds me of my chanter epic)

All in all, it's a memorable trip. The Lv59 druid that I played for my
friend can earn 4 blue bubbles in a night's theatre camp...4 or 5
hours. Before we went PoM, I have actually stopped helping leveling
him. (And I'm glad that I dinged him to Lv60 before the guild gave up
on PoM)
