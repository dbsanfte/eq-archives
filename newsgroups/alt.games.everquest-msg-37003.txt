Even with my best Charisma gear I still pay over 12 plat per Peridot.  At
that rate keeping Symbols on my group costs me around 100 pp an hour.

Given that, I've never "charged" for a Rezz (The gifts of Brell Serilis are
not for sale,) but I'll gladly accept donations freely given.  Donations
have run from 10 plat to a Jaundiced Bone Helm.

I don't maintain a stiff list, but I do know have the names of those who
were generous, and they are more likely to get a prompt reply when the need
my services.
