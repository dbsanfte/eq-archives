Zoning Into Shadowhaven takes a while because of it's complexity.  But
no zone should take 3 hours to zone into.  Here's the deal.  I had to
leave for dinner one day so I just decided to hit the zone line from
paludal and just leave it AFK.  Dinner went longer than expected and I
didn't get back for about 3 hours.  When I turn my monitor back on
what do I see?  I see at the bottom of the screen LOADING, PLEASE
WAIT.  This has happened twice and is aggravating as no other.  I
think verant should give the option of turning detail down in certain
zones ::Cough:: SHAR VAHL ::Cough:: while leaving it at max everywhere
else.  But does anyone know why this is and what I can do about it?
Thanks.
