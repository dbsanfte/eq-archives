I'll put it this way - there are many people who loved EQ but hate EQ2 and 
vice versa, although it's pretty save to say that the latter is a much 
smaller group. ;)

They were vastly different approaches to the same type of game. Whereas 
they are both MMORPG's, EQ1 = a much more open-ended experience while EQ2 
strived to maintain class/encounter/game balance by way of controlling much 
of what a player might be doing at any given time, be it combat, 
tradeskills or questing. It was a far too restrictive approach for my 
tastes.

I would say there is still a strong community, but mostly at the higher 
levels. Lower level players you may encounter are largely just alts of 
higher level players, and therefore equipped with pretty incredible gear 
for their level. That's all well and good until you see a level 20 druid 
tanking better than your level 20 warrior. Then the disparity between the 
haves and the have-nots becomes all too clear.

Honestly, at this point, to a person wanting to give EQ a try I would 
suggest purchasing an EQ collection (Platinum, etc.) and checking out 
http://www.shardsofdalaya.com. It's a free emulated EQ server with it's own 
game world. Think of it as all the EQ character classes (well most of them) 
in a drastically different game world. Most of the gameplay mechanics are 
pretty much the same, but all of the lore and world design have been 
radically changed to make for a much different game. It also has a pretty 
healthy population for lower level players.
