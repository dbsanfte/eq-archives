Some do, some don't.  The only bard haste songs that stack with spell and 
item haste are the Vah Shir xxxxxx haste songs.  Some of the other 
haste/other buff songs may stack, but the haste component does not.

See above.  The warsong and battlecry of the Vah Shir will stack with 
spell haste and item haste, and will allow the haste to exceed the haste 
cap.  The other bard haste songs will stack, if they have nonhaste 
components, in which case, only the nonhaste part of the song is actually 
having an effect.
