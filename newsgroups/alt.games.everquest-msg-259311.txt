While mounted, and not attacking or moving, you get the advantage of 
sitting regen, even while casting spells.  I still canni a lot, but no 
canni dance.  Cannabilization AA helps a lot too.

What you do will depend in part on how you play your shaman.  Barring a 
really small mana pool, your main concern should be mana throughput, not 
mana pool.  You want to be efficient in casting, and in regaining mana.  
If you can do that well, you can solo nonstop, and be a a great asset to 
a group or raid.

Up into my 50s or so, I was always seeking out Wisdom gear, but, you do 
have to consider, I am a tradeskiller, and so it was extremely important 
for that.  For some time now, I have been a hitpoint junky, and despite 
that, I am still maxxed on wisdom at 315 unbuffed.
