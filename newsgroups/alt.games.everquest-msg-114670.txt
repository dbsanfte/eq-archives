OMFG. I started a new necro. You want to talk chimp with uzi,
I am currently chimp with... well, chimp, lobotomy and more
chimpiness to spare. 

Pat and I are playing a Necro/Chanter pair and my pet is the
most imbecelic retarded moronic brain dead piece of evil
crap I have ever had the misfortun... /pet GET LOST!

lol ;) Ok, it may be something to do with me. How the
hells do you control what a pet fights and get it to leave
something alone?

I can hammer /pet back off and of course, before mez can
land he'll get smookered and rengage.

I can /pet kill on a mob in the crowd, fear it to seperate
it out so Pat can mez the remains and what does it do? It stops
attacking that one and turns on the friend left behind still
happily beating on it.

Is there ANY way to get this thing to behave with a semblance
of sanity or should I just treat it as a "oops I overnuked"
guard, let Pat mez everything and set about playing cleric
with death pact, lifetaps and Dark empathy? (or whatever
its called) setting my pet loose only once everythings under
control?

I dont wanna watch the crowd smooshing the hapless chanter,
I want to help and pull some away, but every time I try
I seem to get myself killed ;)

I solo fine btw, then I just let the pet smack whoever it likes
and fear the others away, its coordinating with the 'chanter
thats giving me the heebie jeebies.

The most frustrating thing in the world has to be seeing
