You must have stopped by the vendor's booth.  The most computers were on the
second floor on your way to the Hyatt skywalk.  About 30 - 40 computers.  I
stopped by and checked it out.  Really lame.  Saw someone thrown out of the
game for cheating.  From what I overheard the tournament runners say the
hacker tried loading a hack program via the floppy drive.  And it really
wasn't that big of a deal.  Neither the tournament or the throwing out of
the hacker.  And, sure there was 30-40 computers, but not all were playing
EQ.  Did I say how lame it was?  And the people running it couldn't be more
jaded and bored than Hugh Hefner at an Amish beauty contest.  Having it in
the walkway further reduced any special aspect about it.  Might as well have
been hawking T-shirts.  Very disappointed in it.  It was one of the things I
was actually looking forward to going to GenCon to see.  But it turned out
to be sort of a EQ version of Episode One of Star Wars.  All hype and no
payoff.

Not sure how you could run such an EQ tournament without it being nothing
more than dueling.  Hmmm.  Maybe have a brand new deadly zone that six
person teams have get through.  Team that dies the least and gets through
fastest wins.  Hmmm.  Or maybe you defend some spot from waves of ... hmmm
... blues or even just greens.  One gets past you and game's over for your
team.  Winning team lasts the longest.  Waves get steadily harder and
harder.  Hmmm.  Trivia contest might have been fun.  You try to unlock doors
via answering trivia questions about EQ.

Then again, you did get to see a lot of EQ gamers.  Trust me.  You're glad
you see only their characters on the screen. ;-)
