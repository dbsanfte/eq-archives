Hehe, I remember camping the cloak the last few days of the first time

The tainted brownie verbally taunted the 60 shaman that was tanking
him in between fears: it said 'You not gonna escape the taint, tall
freak!' to him :)

Heh. I never farmed seafuries. A lot of people were on the island that
night and I typoed in the above: the corrupted was up when we got
there, not the tainted.

Well, we had two guild groups down there waiting for Phinny, one group
in seahorse area and one group in swirlspine area. Got at least two
swirlspine belts in addition to the two corrupteds (aka my guildie got
his leafblower 2 nights ago)

And it seems the barracuda isn't going to do me any favors - spent all
last night waiting for him and got nothing more than one dud tainted.
The camp is starting to get to me in a bad way, as I keep muttering
'my kingdom for a fish' and similar things, ponder if barracuda bones
can be used for fletching, and decided I'd call myself Barracuda Bones
if I were a porn star. I've also raised fletching to 122 (using
supplies from Surefall, not the foraged bones :) ) and am close to
maxing swimming. I'd work on fishing too except that I keep breaking
the poles and not bothering to go look for a vendor to get a new one.
