Wow.  This sentence scares me.  Anyone who treats the game like work and
cares only about being "important" in all situations should be
beaten with a "fun stick".

On the other side, big raids simply need clerics, and most need
enchanters.  That does NOT make other classes useless.  I've done well
in plane raids with a shaman healing in our group, but I wasn't in the
pull group - they had a cleric, and needed her :)

A good shaman is way more than a buff monkey.  Malo and Slow are truly
amazing, torpor is all you need to complete heal any caster, and the
lower heals are nice for backup healing.  A bad shaman (or, equally
likely, a shaman in a group that's not having fun regardless of what
roles are available) could decide that buffing was all he does.

Last week I watched a shaman offtank a Kiraikuei in Hate.  Just for
fun (normally we'd mez it or she'd offroot instead), she soloed it from
melee range.  She ended up killing it with zero help.

Besides, the Coca-Cola advertising role is worthwhile in itself.

That said, there are some encounters that are mostly tank/cleric jobs,
with support roles useful mostly in clearing and travel.  This is fine,
as those specific mobs are a tiny minority of the time spent playing the
game.  Heck, they're a tiny minority of the raid that gets 'em.

In no case is this shaman-specific.  All classes except perhaps warriors
and clerics feel underpowered in some situations.  With luck, those
situations are both somewhat rare, and fun anyway because you get
to cheer/joke/chat with friends.
