That'll only happen if you're into the Grimel earring quests. Baking
overall
is fairly easy though; you can get to 191 skill fast with all
storebought
items. And with the new tradeskill UI, getting to 250 skill's a cinch
now
for people cause they dont have to manually do the inane number of 
skill combines required for Misty Thicket Picnics and Halas 10lb Meat
Pies.
Not to mention the best thing in the end about getting 250 skill is
making
your own stat foods instead of shelling out 5-10pp a picnic.
