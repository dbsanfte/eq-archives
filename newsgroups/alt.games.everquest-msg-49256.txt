>Powerleveling is like cheating.  Twinking is like cheating.  

I have spent over 58 days played. That is 58 real life days over the
last two+  years leveling my Druid to 50! I loved every minute of it,
but I am not going to spend that much time on any one character every
again. EQ is just a game.

If Verant didn't want people to "Twink" or "Powerlevel" all they would
have to do is put level limits on items/buffing spells, and then only
allow 1 character per account. To date Verant has NOT done this
(except on the new FV server). 

In Verants eyes "Twinking" and "PLing" is not an exploit or a cheat.
Those that can do it, usually do. Those that cannot, usually bitch and
moan about those that can.

Cheers
