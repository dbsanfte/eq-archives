Way back when I got my first university account, I had someone forge
my email info to a post and sling it to several politcal newsgroups...
The post was blasting one of the presidential candidates. I got
literally flooded with hate mail in response from people who didn't
even bother to look at the headers and see that the posts obviously
came from somewhere other than my .edu address that was listed in the
"from" field... :-/ So, yah, I understand being forged...
