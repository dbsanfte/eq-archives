You should create an enchanter...yeah, we do "nothing" during a fight. ;)
Definitely one of the laziest classes out there...."


It depends a bit here, based on the group. In a good group, with fast pulling,
and short lasting fights, an enchanter can stick to crowdcontrol/tashani/keeping
the rogue hasted. If the fights last longer, the enchanter can 'aid' the cleric
a bit by using chainstuns to reduce the amount of damage done to the tanks, or
by casting slows, so the cleric needs to spend less mana.

Dividing downtime is pretty important. I have no use for 80% mana after a fight
when the cleric is sitting on his butt, meditating.

fear has gone there will be nothing, only I will remain."
