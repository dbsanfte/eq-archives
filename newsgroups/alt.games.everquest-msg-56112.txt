I don't think so. Slam does exactly the same thing as bash, except a large
race can use the skill without a shield, meaning they can slam while dual
wielding or  while using a two-handed weapon. This may not be true of SKs (I
never played one), but slam and bash are one and the same as far as warriors
are concerned, and is a huge advantage for large race warriors. Slam uses
(and raises) the bash skill, so a lvl 5 ogre/troll/barbarian warrior does
not have nearly the same skill as a lvl 60.
