The best part about the expansion is that there are lots of new areas
to explore and things to do that haven't been done many times before,
but I've died so many times over the last few week.

My bard (Level 11)
------------------
Exploring paludal caverns several times. (No, there is no way to get
to the next zone as a level 11 bard without some help)

Fell in the water in shadow haven that leads to paludal caverns. You
need to swim though a tube then zone into paludal caverns.
Unfortunatly I'd neglected my swimming skill on that character and it
was only 3. So I drowned first. I got my swimming skill up to 10 and
just about managed to retrive my corpse. Fell into paludan caverns and
died again very quickly. My necro had to rescue him *again*.

Wanted to get my faction up in shadowhaven so did the quest delivering
stuff. Discovered that it's not really safe to get through echo
caverns to fungus grove at level 11.... Discovered the hard way why
fungus grove was full of high level characters...

My necro (Level 30)
-------------------
Dragged my bard's corpse no end of times to safety.

Died once in echo caverns. Got rooted and attacked by something, I
still don;t know what. But it slowly sucked out my health until I
died. Next time I just gated out to safety...

Died once in paludal caverns. Yes most things in there are green but
that doesn't mean I can sucessfully outrun a train of about 10 of
those lizard things.

Made it though to Vah Shir and beyond... Died once more in hollowshade
moor. Those owlbears are quite tough to kill. Stupid mistake though,
should have pulled the one I was fighting further out to avoid
add-ons.

Died once in Katta Castellum. They *really* don't like my necro there.
So I thought I'd be safe in Sanctus Seru.... No ... Died there too.


Of well, I've lost lots of XP and "wasted" a whole week with no
levelling or getting any loot but just had a really good time
exploring the new world and generally looking around for a change.
Spent quite a lot of time helping out people new to luclin with
directions and information (But only information about where to
die.... I'm getting really good at that)

For me this has made me really want to play EQ again, lots of new
things to do and places to go. And to want to level up my bard and
hope he's not KOS in as many places as my necro.

If you've not died many times, you've not really explored the place at
all in my opinion :-)
