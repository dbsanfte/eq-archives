Hehe. I have not seen this dragon in awhile but it does bring back memories.
I joined a raiding guild way back when and they made the rounds on these
guys often.  For the longest time, one way or another I would end up dead to
this particular dragon.  It was frustrating because at the time we engaged
much harder targets and I had no trouble surviving as off-tank (SK),  but
for some reason I could not get past Klandicar.  I think I was so close once
I even started celebrating seconds before I died. :)  Finally the day came
when I lived to see the dragon fall at which point we moved to DN to kill
Zlandicar, which seemed much easier to me but in fairness I was biased at
the time.  The guild awarded me a necklace for my ST key for finally
surviving Klandi, but I did get a good ribbing for some time.  Good times
though.
