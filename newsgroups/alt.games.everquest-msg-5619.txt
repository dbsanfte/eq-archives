Permit me to reply in kind, sir, in thine own tongue.

Wherefore it were prudent that knaves such as we be battered and bruised
upon our arrival herein, we hath faultered not, therefore remaining erect of
spine and mind.  Those who would have us battered thus, hath felt our sting
and fled, forthwith.  Ne'er in the past nor prophecies of this hallowed
place hath such anger, hatred and loathing reared its evil head, to be
smitten, judiciously by we, the purveyors of truth.

Rest assured, kind sir, that mine heart remains, tarnished n'ere by soot,
nor foot.  Truth is mine companion.  Justice, mine lighted path.  The injust
and hypocrite, mine enemy.  Look thee herefore, unto me, and thou shalt find
what it is thou seeketh.  Cast not thine eyes from the sun, lest thee goest
blind.  Remain steadfast in thine goals, and thine goals shalt surely comest
to thee.

Good Morrow to thee.

Sword
