As a cleric, when I put a LDoN pick-up adventure together, I use go
through the following progression as a guideline:

1. Get an enchanter.
2. If no enchanter, get a bard.
3. If no enchanter and no bard, get:
  a. A beastlord. If no beastlord, get:
  b. A shaman. If no shaman, go LFG.
4. Get a tank. If no bard, order is SK, Pala, War. If bard, Pala, SK,
War. 
5. If no enchanter or bard, get a second tank. For second tank, order
of preference is War, Pala, SK. If no enchanter, bard, or second tank,
but mage is available, go to Tak. If world-class necro is available,
go to MMC. 
6. If no one you've got so far can snare, get someone who can snare.
Trackers are given slight preference.
7. If no bard or SK, look for a monk.
8. Fill the remaining slots for DPS and utility. My personal order of
preference is mage, beastlord, bard, necro, wizard, rogue, everyone
else.

Of course, this is just a guideline. If guildies or friends are LFG,
I'll usually build a group around them. If I know a group's
capabilities, I will adjust. Most of my guild's monks, beastlords, and
rangers, a couple of rogues, and one of our shamans can tank a regular
LDoN without breaking a sweat. I've also done CLR, MAG, MAG, NEC, ENC,
WIZ and other bizarre variants with a fair degree of success.
