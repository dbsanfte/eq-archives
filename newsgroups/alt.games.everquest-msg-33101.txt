A "Game Card" is like one of those prepaid phone cards.  Sony
announced a few months ago that they would make them available for EQ
worldwide.  The idea is that kids can't get credit cards (or they
aren't supposed to), and so instead can take their allowences and buy
game cards.  (Nevermind that EQ is not supposed to be for kids).
