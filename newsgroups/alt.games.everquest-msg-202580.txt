Most of us here have gotten quite tired of seeing the same complaint 
posted here every single patch.  I don't even disagree with the complaint 
to be honest, I would be happy to see them change things so that we can 
really tell if the servers are up and available to play on, I just don't 
complain about it here because it's useless to do so, and it's been done 
after every single patch since the day they changed the server status 
information.
