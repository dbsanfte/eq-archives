dammit Bizbee ! I read through all this shit wondering that, but I thought
Id better read it all in case someone else mentions it, and 2nd from last
post down you say it.....damn you man !!..........8)

I smell bullshit, as he has changed his story in the space of 2 posts.
Firstly he says it is broken, but hang on - as soon as everyone starts
saying go get it swapped, he realises that IF he did have a broken CD - then
there is a good chance a shop will replace it for him (damn, even Sony
might).

SO now he needs a NEW story. He has now LOST the CD, and therefore has no
option but to download it....

You've been rumbled you belgian slag !
