You need to develop some friends to play with, maybe even a decent guild.  
All that aside, you should still be able to get AAXP faster soloing at 
level 65 than soloing at level 58, I know I certainly do.  Went from 
about 2% AAXP per kill at level 58 to 6% AAXP per kill at level 65.  
Takes about the same amount of time to kill the mobs, with less downtime 
in between at level 65.
