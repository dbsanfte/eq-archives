In Reguards to my post on Removing Twinks 4/13 8:59 am. I was just reading
on Casters Realm Verant is in the process of doing just that! According to
Casters Realm the Venomous Axe in the hands of a level 1 is like a 2/24
weapon, at level 35 it will be a 11/24 with proc. There goes any idea of
making new tanks if the rest of the weapons follow suit.
Personally this sucks

Copy of prior post:
Here is an idea to prevent twinking put a damage and delay cap on weapons.
Yes I know there is a damage cap till level 20, but if you have a high
damage weapon you will hit that cap almost every time and if its fast forget
it. Example Soul Defiler 21dam 19dly Sk only and tradeable. This weapon will
hit for max damage almost evey time. Now if the weapon itself had a level
restricted damage and delay cap. Way to do this would be to make all weapons
have a base damage and delay but include the damage bonus into the formula
for max damage instaed of having it added on at the end. Also have a dealy
bonus, as you level the weapon becomes faster and hits harder. Next step do
the same with armor. This way every newbie will be on an equal playing feild
and discourge Higher level players from makeing new characters to twink. The
new Generation of players won't have anything to whine about.
