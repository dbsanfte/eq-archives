And that's the problem.  Yes, I'm bitter that I can't make cultural armor.
Precia was up to seventy-five in smithing before someone mentioned that one.
The entire reason I started this game is because the tradeskilling sounded
interesting.  Verant says we have "no culture."  I find that hard to believe
for someone who was born and raised in Felwithe and was part enough of the
Koada'Dal culture to become a Holy Knight.  With all the Vision that has
fallen aside, would it really be too terribly unbalancing to allow
Half-Elves to make cultural (maybe based on their deity)?

And I still want long hair, dang it.

As far as Paladins, take a look at how the class stacks up.  Sure, we can
cast and melee.  Our damage output is low, we can't dual wield (is there a
good reason for that?), and we can't take damage like a warrior.  Ok, that's
fine, we're not warriors.  Now, look at our spells.  Our buffs are useless,
since a cleric will overwrite all of them.  Our heals are decent in groups,
but we'll never be a good healer like druids and shamen.  Why do I compare
us to druids and shammies?  Because, the three classes are basically
secondary healers.  Clerics get to be the best, because that's what they do
(although, Vernat is trying to change that, so they're pushing in on Pally
territory, now).  Druids can kite and quad-kite to their heart's content.
Shamies aren't exactly weak soloers, either.  My Paladin, OTOH, is having a
hard time against blue undead... the very mob's we're supposed to excel
against.  Meanwhile, I hear my guild shammy wishing he could take on
something other than yellows... Flippin' yellows!  Poor Precia sees a white
con, and she stays way clear.

Let's face it, Verant has their favorites.  They love Wizards... what melee
class can do what team manaburn does?  How about the unholy AE group?
Wizards are the golden children of EQ.  Paladins and SK's occupy the lowest
rungs of power.  We have no segment of the game that we excel in, except
dying.

Granted, I didn't used to be so bitter.  I simply saw playing a knight class
as a challenge.  After the Druid and Shammy CH fiasco, though, my opinion
started to turn.  Looking at the phenominal cosmic powers that come with
PoP, I'm really starting to get bitter.  Maybe I'm over reacting, but it
does seem as if Verant either hates Pallys (and Half-elves), or they're too
busy making gods out of their favorite classes to bother fixing the rest of
us.
