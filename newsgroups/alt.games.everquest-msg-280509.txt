I'm partial to an inexpensive KVM setup myself if you don't actually 
need to see the 2nd screeen on all the time. You can optionally run the 
keyboard and mouse through the kvm and have just one set, or run 2 sets 
and just have the monitor on the switch.

It removes quite a bit of desk clutter. And instead of alt-tab, to 
swithc you just push a button/ turn a knob/ or use the kvm hotkey if 
applicable or whatever.

FWIW KVM costs about the same as or less than a 2nd monitor... although 
so many people have 15" crts collecting dust that you probably have 
access to a free one.

I'm partial to the Dr.Bott USB KVMs myself because they are PURE 
switches. A lot of the more elaborate KVMs feature Keyboard/Mouse 
emulation and other tricks... I don't care for these... as the emulated 
keyboard often lacks full feature support of the attached device. (e.g. 
Logitech Wireless keyboards often don't work with these enhanced KVMs.)

My own setup is 3 PCs... PC1 is my main box. PC2 is my 2nd box. PC3 is 
KVMed with my 2nd box. I run voice software, and surf the web etc on the 
3rd box. I have 2 monitors... my 1st always displays eq, my 2nd is 
either showing PC2 or PC3. It works a treat. And I don't have room, or 
desire to have 3 keyboards and mice and monitors. If I didn't 2 box EQ, 
I'd probably KVM all 3 units.

While you can get PS2 KVM switchs I don't like them, as they tend to be 
flaky, and can lock up the computer. (Especially at the entry level 
price point.) Many PCs don't like having PS2 devices attached while the 
unit is on. ... which is why many kvms have those aforementioned 
emulated keyboards and mice... to shield the PC from knowing the 
keyboard was actually removed.

USB is more plug and play, and it takes maybe 1 second after a switch 
for my keyboard and mouse to start operating. One caveat with a usb 
switch... they usually only switch one port. So you need a USB keyboard 
with USB ports in it to plug the mouse into...Nearly all recent Mac OS 
keyboards all have usb ports, as do several MS and Logitech ones, and 
even some generics.) Failing that you can use a USB hub device.

cheers
