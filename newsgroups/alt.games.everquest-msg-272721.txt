Agreed. But the new guild perks do have some drawbacks for the non-
guilded, and the coalitions.

Au contraire. The new tools -appear- to require everyone to be in the 
guild, (and probably to have the exansion too!) before they really start 
working.

How will a 2-guild joint raid benefit from the new tools? How will a 
guild raid with friends from other guilds work? What of lower level 
guilds filled with members who don't have the new expansion?

These tools to me seem to smack of an all-or-nothing benefit. Mass 
summon corpse is only really great if it actually summons -everybody-, 
otherwise summon has to summon the stragglers. A persistent portal to X 
is only great if everybody in the raid can use it, otherwise someone has 
to lead the extras around another way. It really undermines the 
usefulness of these tools. Whats the point of doing your MGBs inside a 
hall without timers, if 5 or 6 of the raiders are standing outside and 
can't come in?

It really does effectively 'punish' guilds for including a few friends 
on a raid, or running joint-raids.

This is all based on the assumption that you'll need to be in the guild 
to access the guild hall, which seems likely.

If the assumption is that natural behaviour is that which people will do 
on their own, it doesn't need to be rewarded.
