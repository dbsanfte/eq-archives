No need to be dragged down by the wimpy chanter, what can he do.

As long as he wasn't rude about saying no that's fine with me.

It's 'No buffs for joo unless I can spare the mana' btw.

Just shows any kind of group can work. I went down to charm solo when it was
just dead one night, and I saw three necros soloing, bitching at each other
about ksing, that sort of crap. I invited all three, two joined immediatly,
one joined after he realized we were clearing three rooms every time he got
his 3 spawns (that we promised he could have uninterfered with). For two
hours all I did was pull, haste pets, nuke, and self buff (the necros were
all liching) and you could have gone afk anywhere withing a fairly large
area around us and likely never get attacked.

Some people are antisocial. Some are A$$h0les. I think you got the former.
The former doesn't make life miserable, you just wonder why they aren't
playing Diablo or Neverwinter Nights.

I don't even know who he is, so I do.
