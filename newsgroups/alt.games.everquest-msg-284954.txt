Hm.  Well, in researching this a bit to handle the original
request (adding "riposte" to the glossary) I wanted to see
what other defenses might not apply to ripostes (e.g., can
you parry a riposte), and as I look through my logs I see
some entries that sure LOOK as though a riposte was riposted.

In general, it seems the result of the riposte gets logged
before the riposte message itself, as in

  Master Glox tries to punch YOU, but YOU block!
  You try to crush Master Glox, but Master Glox ripostes!

  A smoke dervish hits YOU for 120 points of damage.
  You try to punch a smoke dervish, but a smoke dervish ripostes!

That said, here are all my log entries for a particular second:

  You crush a reclusive lavaspinner for 46 points of damage.
  You crush a reclusive lavaspinner for 109 points of damage.
  Lober crushes a reclusive lavaspinner for 43 points of damage.
  A reclusive lavaspinner tries to hit YOU, but YOU block!
  You try to punch a reclusive lavaspinner, but a reclusive lavaspinner
	ripostes!
  You crush a reclusive lavaspinner for 46 points of damage.
  A reclusive lavaspinner tries to hit YOU, but YOU riposte!
  You try to punch a reclusive lavaspinner, but a reclusive lavaspinner
	ripostes!

Sure looks like the last one is a case of me riposting a riposte.
A casual skim of my logs turned up other cases as well.

Sorta makes me want to go find an enraging mob and try autoriposte
vs enrage after all, and time-space continuum be hanged!
