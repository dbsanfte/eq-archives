I normally don't (knowingly) reply to posts that have
already been answered, but I'd just like to add, if you want
to do a quest that raises your Militia faction *without*
damaging any other factions, I recommend the Notes to Janam
and Rebby quests (you can do both at the same time with each
trip). These quests involve between East and West Freeport
repeatedly, so it's best to turn off anything that causes
you to zone slower. Each hit is very tiny, so you must do
these quests for many hours.

For other ideas, browse here:

(Note that improving Militia faction won't help with some
merchants in Freeport.)
