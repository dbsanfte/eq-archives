Summoned damage bracers are not the same as IDI-IV items -
here's the entry for the jade bracer 

http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2220

DD bracers are geared to work on all *mage* dd's until
the next bracer.  Summon Opal Bracelet is a 44 spell, and
there is no 39 mage nuke, so Jade bracers work on spells up
to level 34.
