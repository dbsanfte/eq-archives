The workaround for this is simple enough, though:

/ttell are you using this dead body, %T?

Targetted tell sends message to the owner IF he's online.  If
he's not, you get a message to that effect.

No need to wait for a reply if you are doing driveby rezzing
(presumably off a click stick), if the tell goes thru, rez away.
