You can get a Silvery War Axe. The damage won't change (6), but you'll
be doing more of it with the lower delay (22). Or you can possibly pick
up a Crystal Fiber 8dmg 26dly. And you should seriously consider
training in 2hs. You can get an Axe of the Iron Back 16dmg 37dly for
your price. And as a young paladin, also consider getting into 2-handed
piercing as the Messenger of the Queen is very cheap for what it
provides. My paladin is the past the point (lvl 48) where he wants to
use it, but the stats you get for the price (300pp or less) are great.
