No, it doesn't change whether or not you can get an increase from the
combine, so you don't get the trivial message based on that.  It raises you
effective skill for your chance of successfully combining.  It does not
affect your skill level when it comes to increases.  So, with skill 100,
+5%, skill 105, you do a combine that is trivial at 101, you will never get
the trivial message, you may or may not get a skill increase, your chance of
success is based on a skill level of 105.

I am not saying that this is absolutely the way it works, this is just the
best guess from people who have done extensive testing.

The things that are known with reasonable certainty are:

1.  It does improve your chance of a succesful combine.
2.  It does not affect your chance of a skill increase.
