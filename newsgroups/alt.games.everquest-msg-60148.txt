It is what you make it, each of us has a choice.  You choose to make it
about numbers and it is, but you are easily ignored by those who choose
to make it about something more.  Anyone who claims that because they
and many like them have removed the greatest potential fun from the game
means that no one else can enjoy that fun is either giving themselves a
bit too much credit or has been sitting on his butt in Velks bitching
about SEU production for too long.
