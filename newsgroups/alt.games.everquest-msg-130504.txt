"donation" to me usually means some paltry offering that isnt worth my time.
Just be upfront and offer her 20p. I would expect the round trip to take at
least 15 mins. (not 30 seconds, very funny). I doubt that I would be
interested in someone wanting me to leave my camp and go 2 zones away to
bind someone "for donation". If she didnt want to do it for 20p, try getting
on the auction channel and trying.
