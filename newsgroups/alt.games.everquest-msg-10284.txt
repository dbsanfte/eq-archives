Yep, the nice thing is if you wait around in a couple areas (killing

about the swarm mother. Not really sure what level it is but this big
beetle with lots of lil ones drops down. The big beetle always drops
either a black sapphire, jacinth, diamond or blue diamond. This is a
nice way other than waiting on a list from your guild/buying diamonds
or blue diamonds. I had a jeweler in my guild then make me a couple
nice resist things for cost.

Yeah heard a lot of rumors about a new plane.. but nothing from
verant. Hopefully if they do it will be a place where druid plane
armor exists and ACTUALLY DROPS. They nerfed POG and for my guild its
still a candy store while as a druid not a dang thing drops in fear,
kael or especially on the 2nd floor of hate (not been to TOV yet so
not sure how quest stuff drops there)

Don't worry about any ill effects or "rabies." Though it says "a rabid
wolf" they are not acutally rabid in that you don't get rabies from
bites. You also don't actually get sick by hanging out in the area its
just emoting, although my wood elf druid girl started to feel "not so
fresh" after a bit.
