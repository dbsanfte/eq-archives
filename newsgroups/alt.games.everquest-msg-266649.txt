Hey that is not a bad guess )

I gotta say I could not agree at all with aNdy (apart form lack of server 
info on web site) my first impressions are very good.
Much more so then Horizons and I played that for 9 months (had a great 
little guild)
So far apart from crashing it has ran very smoothly and looks fantastic.

 It is early days and I may be incorrect but

I miss the totally remote camera of horizons so you could swing around and 
watch combat etc from any angle using number pad
- esp useful if you are a large character fighting small stuff

npc text bubbles are cropped at the bottom on my default res

whats with the tiny tiny invent?

names what a pain only having one word - very backward step

group names are very visible but a small arrow saying which direction is 
missed though it could be added I suppose

perhaps one is levelling too fast at first but I suppose this is the norm 
and low lvl special attacks are too flash ( personal opinion of course )

Anyway must play it now I do love the game and I know I will be playing it 
for months/years to come - it is a shame a character cannot jump servers as 
in Runescape

CU all
