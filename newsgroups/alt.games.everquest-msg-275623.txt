I felt there was less buying for a while, but I chalked it up to the
fact that a lot of people were getting stuck in the geometry because
the patcher doesn't update the files properly.  (You have to go to the
Advanced patcher options and force a full file check of the Luclin
expansion.)  I set up a hotkey on my trader so I could /ooc the patcher
instructions whenever I saw another person going WTF...

The past few days sales have been back to roughly what they were before
DoN came out.

I *have* noticed certain items seem to be dropping a bit in price, e.g.
Leatherfoot Haversacks (used to be around 5k+ on my server, sometimes
could be found for as low as 4700ish, now are often seen at 4300).  I
assume that's because of the tradeskill AAs in OOW that let you salvage
materials on a failure, and/or the higher tradeskill caps in DON.

I do think the layout is worse in some regards.  When I sell my rallic
pack (lore), if I have another pattern in the bank, I need to run back
to the bank, make a pack, then use the teleporter to get to the main
section where the bag exchange lady stands, then go back through the
teleporter and off to a spoke to set up shop again.  It's a lot more
hassle than in the old bazaar, but it doesn't arise that often.

The real pain is when the Find Trader feature tells me mysterious forces
prevent me from finding my destination.  I can sometimes figure out
where a trader is using right-click to orient myself facing them, but
it's hard.  The time it gets really bad is when my map window comes up
blank, which happens once in a while.  Then I have to use the Find
window to seek out the Discord Merchant just to find my way out of the
trading section, since all the corridors look alike.  You'd think it
wouldn't have killed them to include some sort of signs or colored
walls or other clues to let people know which passages lead where.
