I'm not sure I can handle much more of this.

First a former guildie gets shot and killed Friday
(http://www.tritonguild.com).  Then another guildmate and her daughter are
killed last night when her car is rammed head-on by a drunk driver
(http://www.equnleashed.com).

I hadn't talked to Makavelie in a while.  But he was always clowning around
and was fun to have on raids.  He was also willing to drop everything and
lend a hand if you needed it.

Noitide had stopped playing a few months back.  She had just bought a house,
and gotten a new job that she was excited about, and both were keeping her
too busy to play.  She was one of my favorite people to group with, and she
was always sending me tells to come join them within minutes of my logging
in.  I'd always hoped that she'd come back.  Every now and then she'd post
on our message board and say hi.  And now she's gone.

I love to play, but you always win.
