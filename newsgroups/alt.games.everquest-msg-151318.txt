Just like any other class, some people do mostly guild or
friend groups and some people do pick-up groups.  At the
high-end, you'd be surprised how many people solo for XP or
take minimal groups.

Neither is hardly the point.  Of course people don't kick group
members out because a "better" class comes along.  And, obviously,
a group waiting for a healer is going to take the first one that
comes along that can heal sufficiently.  But most zones only hold
so many groups.   And if none of those groups need a healer because
they're all full, you LFG, right?  Meanwhile, a group will take a
shaman (buffs and slow and backup heals) or another druid (snare
and nuke) if they have a druid healer already.

The "problem" with the new heals is that clerics just don't stack
well, even with the new hammer.  You can take two druids, for
instance, and one could heal while one can snare and nuke and
backup heal.  The only thing clerics do really well is heal.  And
that's no longer needed in high-end XP groups fighting low blues,
if it ever was.
