Once again, no precise numeric way to prove it, that's what I've been trying
to say, and the bars tend to move erratically anyways, such as how if you
have full mana (as in go AFK medding for 4 hours) and cast a high drain
nuke, the mana bar barely moves, but one more of the same spell and you lose
what looks like 15% of your mana. (and then proceed to pump out 14 more
nukes)

and besides, trying to root or snare or DoT an HG for me would result in me
shouting "AAHHH, HG wants me dead! HELP!"  and running for the nearest zone
with a big fat man on my ass. (or replace HG with SG and a big arabian on my
ass)
