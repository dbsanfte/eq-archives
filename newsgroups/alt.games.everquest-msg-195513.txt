As we enter the realm of bullshit we realize this thread has gotten
silly.

The things that aggrivate many of us is the way changes go live on
test 2 days before the live patch. Now thats just silly and stupid.
Cause we know they are gonna be screwed up and guess what, we are
right more than wrong.

There can be no library conflicts aside from the remote chance two
dlls have the same name and path or gross and I mean really stupid
coding errors which prob would reside in EQ if it were to happen. And
dare we think back to luclin where the cards they (VI soon to be SoE)
told us to buy didnt work for weeks? (Think that was the last time
they did that)  No this bunch is halfassed just be glad its only a
game and not something important. As paying consumers we owe them
nothing, not patience, not understanding, not one damn thing. On the
bright side they do manage somehow to keep out of the ditches enough
that peeps still pay for the product, its a great game but that has
nothing to do the bunch running this show now. The only thing they do
well is make money lol. Now my hats off to them on that point.

Neither do I, only because its a game. Personaly one would think pride
would motovate them to higher performance levels after four years of
the same product but seems not. Cant wait for the day I see SoE on a
programers or network engineers resume. Would call them in to
interview just find out wtf was going on over there. Wouldnt hold it
against em though...much.
