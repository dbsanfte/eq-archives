It's not the availability of oil that would be an issue, but the *price* 
of oil. I know that, in a pinch, the US could be self-sufficient in oil 
if it decided to exploit all its resources, but the price of oil is one 
big destabilizing factor for any economy, more so one as oil-intensive 
as the American. While I agree with you, in principle, that nothing can 
guarantee that Iraq would remain a "friendly" regime forever and ever, 
by intervening now the US will have an important say on at least the 
next Iraqi administration... Hell, if they play their cards well it 
could be like the US getting a seat at OPEC. I can see this being well 
worth a nice, short war.

I'm not much of a betting man, but mark my words, North Korea will come 
out of this crisis with no change of administration, and a lot more 
international aid than it gets now as the price from allowing UN 
inspectors back into those nuclear research centers.
