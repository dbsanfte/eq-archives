Once you've gone to all the trouble of getting to the royals, stay.  Kill
the king, then go kill the queen (warrior epic) then find something else to
amuse yourselves for a bit, and do it again.  And again.  They spawn
regularly (recent posts say two hours, which seems longer than I remember)
and you can outfit quite a few clerics and warriors with their pieces.. and
if your guild is mid 50s, you'll probably like the rest of the drops of
these two big guys, I recall staying even after we had noone left that
needed epic drops, just because it was a nice camp area with decent loot.

Most epid raids are done on a "get in, get the drop, get out" basis, but it
doesn't have to be this way; people go to the Kael arena or the Halls of
Testing and make an evening of it... well Chardok Royals is that kind of
camp if you are of the right level.
