    K. You didn't list the two most important stats - HPs and AC. All those
other stats are secondary to those two.

    Changes I'd make, were it my monk (mine is level 40): trade out Orc Fang
earrings for Electrum Black Sapphire earrings. Change Spider Fur Cloak for
(IIRC) Shimmering Terror Hide cloak (it's 2 AC lower, but has about 50 HPs
and close to the same stats). Get an Acrylia Mantle to replace the Drolvarg.
Turn FBSS and Shissar Scale Gauntlets into Silver Chitin Hand Wraps and a
Spider Fur Belt. Get Acrylia Reinforced leggings to replace the Gatorscale.
And replace that Serp Bracer at all costs - my monk wears wrists I tailored
for him, Shaded Hide Wristbands (AC 12 STR/INT 3 all saves 3 weight point
five). Now, I have no idea what the market is like on your server so I don't
know if this can be done for 6 K (on my server you'd get 2 K for your FBSS
and spend 5 K on the SCHW's, for example). But you should be able to figure
out what you can do for how much.

    What weight-reducing pack do you have, BTW?

    Your weapons are exceptional. Have you been keeping your hand to hand
up?
