You don't say what armor you have now.
With 1500 plat I'd say buy darkforge pieces or quest for it yourself.

Or I'd buy whatever crustacean you could buy which makes you feel like
you are not a wimpy dark elf basically. Crustacean is the twink armor
of the day though so its kind of expensive. Basically any bodypart
crustacean is VERY good because it all has str (convenient) but mostly
because of its sta which is freaking huge. The stuff adds a ton of hp
on a troll or ogre but should be pretty good for you too.

Crustacean Shell Breastplate
MAGIC ITEM  
AC: +19   Str: +5    Sta: +15    Cha: -8 

Is the bp for instance. Basically it rivals or equals the
ac of darkforge while having much better stats. Of course piece by
piece it will cost more than darkforge too, that is why I say upgrade
to it as you can.

Beyond that if you are really on a budget fill in spaces with fine
steel which is player made and usually pretty cheap. Just get plain if
you can or perhaps a cheap color like blue. If someone is selling
green or something they mark it way up since its a rare color.
