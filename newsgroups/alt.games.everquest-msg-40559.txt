Just think its bad luck. The problem happens when too many players sit at the
port spot, and then make a pile-up of players you can fall down from.

If you try a little jumping around a sitting troll you will notice you can take
up to 10 dmg from falling from him. Imagine what damage you take from 5-6
players that are in one spot.
