You wont be able to go there *now*, but you might be able
to buy, or very soon, go to runnyeye where some low level
haste gloves now drop.

>> Archeologists pack (Najena?)

Yeah, you'll need to buy most of these. You might be able to handle
najena with a group now, and around level 20 sol a will become a
magnificent dungeon for you - easy old world critters, mostly uncamped,
lots of FS drops and the occasional nice loot. Most of the loot has
been surpassed by velious/kunark now, though. 

Oh, because its uncamped you may need to take a group with you.

Also: As a ranger do not neglect hide and sneak. These are *useful*
skills that lots of folk ignore. And remember, you can bind in evil
cities like oggok and neriak ; get bound inside the entrance zone 
away from any guards and as soon as you respawn there, sit down, mem
camoflauge, stand up, invis yourself, zone out. 

Makes cazic thule, Solusek, lavastorm, etc, far far nicer for you.

Oh, check the guards for the particular city dont see invis first - its
a long time since I was a low enough level to still want to be hunting in
antonica near city zones like that.

Well, yes I wasnt suggesting you go for a tinkers bag - just illustrating
the range. There are also "purses" that can reduce the weight of coin but
only monks really care about those. 

Be careful not to pay over the odds for a weight reducing container that
can only hold uselessly small items.

>Thank you for a lot to think about.

Oh, well heres the final final piece of vital advice.
