Hard to say until you are actually there, as with most doomsday

I'd start up some n00b characters and see how much of my guild hung in
there. I'd also keep an even closer eye on the release of SWG, though.

I imagine, knowing what I know now, that I'd either roll up a druid or a
monk and level my ass off into the thirties or forty, until I could MQ
the jboots quest and the Staff of Temp flux. Then I'd re-roll my wizard
(and worship Sol Ro this time, damnit!) outfit him with everything the
PLing character could manage, and then powerlevel the living fuck out of
him until he got to quadding age.
