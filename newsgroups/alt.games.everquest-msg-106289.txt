if  you are in the right spot him or his place holder spawns every 60 or 90
minutes *Can't remember exactly* and iirc he spawns on average of 1/10
spawns... randomly... so you can get him 2 times in a row or not for 20
spawns... when I did the camp I was also running round GFay getting stuff
for a nother quest I was doing at the time... took me... 4 to 6 spawns can't
remember been awhile
