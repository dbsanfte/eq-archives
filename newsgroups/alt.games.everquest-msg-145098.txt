Thanks for the comments-- I'll do my best to answer your questions.

No evil and no money.  Promise.  I'm being completely straight up. 
That said, I know there is a tremendous amount of scam in the NGs and
always has been.  To clarify, I'm brought on to help promote the game
by working with the biggest fans and their web spaces.  SOE knows that
while Gamespy and the "big" gaming sites all have info, there's a need
to bring the fans a step closer.  That's my goal.  I've reached out to
several of you over email as I didn't want to clutter AGE, but I also
didn't want to miss letting anyone know-- thus posted through google. 
Even if you don't have a website, you can help-- you may be able to
recommend people that it would be appropriate to reach out to- you
know the online EQ resources better than I ever could.  Hope this
helps to clarify- please drop me a line off-list if you have
additional questions.

Cheers,
Jason
