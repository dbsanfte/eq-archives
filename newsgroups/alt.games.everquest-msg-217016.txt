Interesting.  Just went out looking on the Web, and found examples as per my
description.  Possibly the rule's been changed some time in the past 25
years and it's slowly trickling through the system.  Also, it's apparently
more complicated than just "do or do not"; it's closer to "add an 's' if it
creates another syllable, otherwise not".

(As far as the "it's" thing I wrote, mea culpa.)
