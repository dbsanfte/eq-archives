If it's a tip, then I expect service.  Don't wait for the group to fill and
don't make me wait to join a group, just to get KEI (or anything).  You'll
get less of a tip.  That said, I don't pay for KEI, at all.  If I am PoK and
it is offered, I seldom refuse, but I won't wait more than about 2 mins to
get in a group, for it.  I have been known to stand around waiting for 5
minutes for a MGB Voice of Quellious (there were 108 chars affected when it
went off. I counted the log out of curiosity).

I get tired of the /shout, /ooc, /auc giving buffs in all areas.  "Casting
Aego at rock by bank for 70pp PST" "KEIing for donations.  Open trade
winbdow for invite" (This really annoys me, if it's a donation, it should
not be a requirement.  Or, can I offer you a stack of fishing grubs for it?)

I started shouting "Level 59 Necro buffs for 100pp, PST.  Gotta pay to get
them".  Oddly enough,  got no responses.
