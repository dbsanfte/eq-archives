Not considering people in the supernatural hell, I wonder how many people
there are who just stay in their homes all day too afraid to go out or
connect to anyone. That is the way I am for the most part, am I the only one
or is this an epidemic?

I've talked to other people who are the same way, so I can only assume that
is the way it is and it is not just me.

Is everyone completely alone?
