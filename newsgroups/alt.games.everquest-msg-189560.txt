interesting.  I'm running winME with 640MB - I have had, on occassion, wierd
hangs, but nothing similar to described in link.

I'm fairly certain my probs are due to software incompatibilities between
Netscape Radio app and EQ startup - EQ often fails to start if radio
running, but once EQ started, can start radio and be fine four hours...

This is mildly distressing to me, because I REALLY do not want to buy XP...
