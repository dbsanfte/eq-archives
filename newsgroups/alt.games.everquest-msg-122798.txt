Hi all,

Ok, I have gone the route of DL -> KC with my Beastlord and now my
Warrior and hate it to death. Am now stuck in that same situation
again. As an Iksar are my choices limited (I know Katta hates CT
worshippers) as to where I can go and get a group and some XP? I have
been to Dawnshroud Peaks (fighting Rockhoppers) and to Maiden Eye
(with level 55+ guildies fighting umbrous thingies), I find those two
so far are great xp and very nice drops. But KC, what is the appeal to
it? Burning Wood would seem a much better place. In KC you can count
on 1 train every 5 minutes, and that is a minimum. Problem is finding
a group in ME for my level is very tough, and Dawnshroud is almost
non-existant as far as groups where I want. I love having a big guild
and getting a few people to go to these places but hate it when I am
the lowest in the group and get very little xp (yes it is a trade off,
xp or loot sometimes neither).

Anyone have suggestions for good places to get a group and some nice
xp for level 51 in a zone where there are not trains every 5
minutes...I can deal with 10 or 15 but KC is a joke. Also I am on the
Quellious server if anyone has a cleric or Druid and wants to team up.
