We've had more than one come back to EQ just for this, so you wouldn't
be alone in that regard. ;)

I think we're achieving a happy medium there. We still use PoK and any
other zone in the game, though the Bazaar is off-limits with just a few
rare exceptions. Perhaps the biggest beef people had with the PoK was
the fact that it rendered much of the old-world content obsolete. The
fact that we rely on what we loot for weapons and armor keeps us hunting
in those zones.

We also considered that possibility. However, many already had
characters on FV, and couldn't be expected to start up another account
for this. Additionally, these days farming plat and blowing it in the
Bazaar offers plenty of opportunity for twinking, so there would still
be an easy method of circumventing the single character limitation.

Roleplaying is fun, but many find it a bit of a distraction. I enjoy it. 
I'm just not that great at it. :P
