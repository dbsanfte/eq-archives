I'm struggling with this one. I use HO's as much as possible when 
soloing, but when I group, I find that it's nearly impossible to complete 
one. It seems I always have to resist the urge to pipe up with, "Hasn't 
anyone here ever heard of heroic opportunities?!" or some other shout of 
exasperation. I normally chalk it up to the fact that we're still in the 
low levels of the game and it's not all that necessary just yet.

I guess I'm just always trying to fight as efficiently as possible. It's 
often not required at this stage of the game, but that first time 
everyone has to share the xp debt because someone died, it does become an 
issue.

A couple of questions, though. Are there HO's that I can execute myself 
while in a group that aren't affected by what anyone else is doing?

HO's in a group setting seem like they would actually lessen the group's 
effectiveness, as everyone would have to interrupt their typical attack 
sequences to ensure that each step is executed in an uninterrupted 
manner. How the heck does everyone in the group know who is trying to 
execute each step and when? For instance, if the HO calls for a nuke, 
then a melee attack, and two casters see the nuke icon pop up and both 
cast (likely one slightly before the other), won't that first nuke land, 
causing the HO to move to the next step (melee attack) just as the second 
nuke lands, at that point being the incorrect action to further the HO 
and cancelling it?

I'm sure there has to be a proper way of executing an HO, and that I am 
just missing something here.
