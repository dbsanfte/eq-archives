If you want an example of necro power I can demonstrate it for you.

I play a 65 beastlord, my friend plays a 63 necro, if our pets duel with no
buffs of any sort, its anyones guess, basically the first one to enrage
wins.

If we buff our pets, but offer no assistance to pets once it has begun, the
beast pet will destroy the necro pet.

If the necro duels my fully buffed (fully buffed includes all resist buffs,
even ferocity) pet, the only method my friend has found so far that is
effective is letting it beat on him and then tapping him, it is HIGHLY
resistant to anything else. (my resists are around 170-200 each with my own
buffs + gear, im not sure what the pets are base, so I dont know if he uses
mine or uses his own, I buff him too just in case.)

1 on 1 me vs him with no pets, and whatever buffs we care to get, he wins. I
have not found a way to beat him yet, I think I could if my pet helped but
his snare is what gets me, I cant go bash him once he gets it to land and my
spells are resisted just as often as his are. he just has more of them.



Now, all of these examples were taking into account that I do not heal the
pet. If I heal the pet I will win(eventually, when he runs oom or zones) but
apparently im not allowed to do that anymore, somehow its cheating :P


Hope this helps.
