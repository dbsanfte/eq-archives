Narrowing it down abit just to good points.

Human;
Nuetral faction everywhere (almost) as agnostic.
More damage output with hands than the Iksar (believe damage is the same but
delay is slightly lower)

Iksar;
Regen
better AC
night vision
natural skills (forage, swimming)
less populated newbie hunting zones
better animation

All monks can wear robes. You have prolly only seen Ikky ones in robes as
they are the monk of choice.
Sneak will not help you get thru a city, someone will still see you. Hide +
Sneak will but guess what, you don't get hide.

If you have an issue with faction you could find the Ikky a struggle, if, on
the other hand you like adventuring, aren't in a level race and are willing
to kill hundreds of greens to enable you to be able to stay within soft skin
cities.

The poor animation and look of characters should change with SoL but from
what I have seen of the models I prefer the old ones..still, if they improve
the skins a bit they may be ok.
