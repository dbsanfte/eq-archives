> The overthere would be pitiful for exp

I disagree, I am flying thru 45th (as my friend is thru 35th) in comparison
to hunting in DL's but due to my equipment and the shaman buffs I may be
dropping the mobs quicker than Jaz could (no offense, I guarantee by mid
August you'd have passed me in level, eveyone does, eventually :ï¿½)).

I can make a yellow bubble in 3 hrs. It took me about the same time to make
3 blues in DL's with a full group (no one higher than 46th) I was the puller
then and given that I was desperate for exp I didn't hang about.

Forget grouping with any more tho, 2 at that level is the limit for good
exp.
Don't forget that the high level Stonegazers and Knights are around 36 or
37th...putting them away with next to no downtime gives plenty of exp.
