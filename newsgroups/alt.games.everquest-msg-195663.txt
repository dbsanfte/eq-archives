I have to take issue here. If the tanks are to contribute on every fight, 
they are going to need some serious healing on a regular basis. That means 
there will be plenty of healers spending plenty of mana all the time. That 
also means that there will be med time - *for everyone*.

There is time to med, especially if you pace yourself, and just because you 
are pacing yourself, doesn't mean you are not making a valuable 
contribution to the fight.
