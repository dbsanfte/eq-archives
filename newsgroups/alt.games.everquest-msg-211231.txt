I was wondering why you would say that. But then I noticed you're just level
26 :).
The earth pet is the main soloing tool for levels 51-60 or so. It gives you
the opportunity to chain-pet which is about the most efficient way to kill
for mages. It also is one of the few ways for mages to take on mobs way
stronger then you could normally take on.

Soloing in dungeons almost require you to have the earth pet untill you get
nukes that do 20% of their hp in single shots.

Although this is mostly for 51+ mages, it is usually advised to try it
earlier in your career when the exploss is not so horrible. Around level 30
or 34 or so you can take down SG's in oasis with chainpetting. Simple
pet-tank won't hold it and aggro kiting is just too damn dangerous without
sow :).

Most people won't say it. It's your responsibility to keep an eye on your
pets and choose the right one. Earthpet can be nice if you have no
snarer/rooter in the group when dungeon crawling.
For most groups the rootaggro is hard to work with, but if you're wise you
could teach the groupmembers how a rooted mob can work to your advantage.
There are 2 issues why root is usually frowned upon:
1. Issue: Aggro gets messed up.
Answer: Well not messed up but the mob will attack the closest person and
not the one with the highest aggro. What needs to be done is that the tank
person should stand close to the mob while the other members hit it at
(near) max melee range (notice that your pet is usually at max melee range
so the other melee just have to stand next to it :) ). The obvious positive
part in this is that the mob will not lose aggro on the tank while it's
rooted, even not when the necro goes in a dotting frenzy or the cleric sits
down right after a massive heal.
Also note that melee should be trained in max melee range fighting because
of raids later in their careers for various reasons.
2 Issue: the mob won't run so the tank gets hurt a lot more.
Answer: Aside from the fact that only the tank gets hurt and not more wimpy
partymembers thus saving a lot of healing mana you can also point to the
fact that a running mob won't get damage by your damage shield (which you
keep on the MT at all times ofcourse) plus no melee will have "out of melee
range" troubles while chasing the mob. Both mean the mob will go down a lot
faster, you can pull another faster and thus exp will be flowing faster.

There are counter arguments ofcourse but if the earth is all you have make
the best out of a bad situation *grin*. (ow and note that your earth
actually is your best pet at that time which means using that or an older
one means even slower kills. something you don't want to happen :) ).

I learned to use arguments like this when I hit lvl 51 and your only pet
(earth) flat out owns the lvl 49 ones.

Very true :). The focus items give a small boost, good enough to really go
out of your way to get a pet which you can focus.
Though I would advise to farm the pieces for the other focus items as soon
as you can. At level 24+ you can farm najena for the items and you can
usually bribe a higher level player for the giant toes (ask the person
farming the named giant in OOT when you get there for instance).
