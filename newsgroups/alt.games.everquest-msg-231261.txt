Hi All

While recovering from the holiday. I had a brain wave (or leftover 
hangover not sure which)

As my pet hates are farmers and power levellers who strip a low level 
zone of monsters for their own use. While characters like mine are 
trying to make a living.

Farmers for items.

While power levellers for example surround their client who have huge 
damage shields on them with all the grimlings in the zone. In at least 
one case, ran off with what I and my warder was fighting plus the rest 
of the village :(

So to combat this I thought of 2 ideas.

1) Negative experience for killing something say 40 odd levels lower 
than yourself.

So kill everything in Shadeweaver to try and get lesser shades to spawn 
and lose a level.

2) Spells or combat initiated against a say a monster 40 levels lower 
than you. Means that monster when it dies gives no experience or loot to 
anyone, it disappears as if an NPC killed it.

So the power leveller client gets bruised and battered for little gain.

Sssoooo.  I can see the plus points.

Kick irritating slags where it hurts.

But as with most bright ideas. What have I forgotten.
