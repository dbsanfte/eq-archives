      Thank you.  But I worked through the hate the old fashioned way. 
By sharing the pain with unsuspecting others.  I posted the link, pretty
much with the same title and the same way (/shameless steal = ON) on
both the CoH and Xplay forums.  I take comfort in knowing that I'm not
the only one who got that song stuck in my head.

   And it *did* help with my hate.  Some of the Xplay guys reported
listening to the song for over 20 minutes.  I caught on after 3 reps.  I
bet they're still hearing the catchy beat pounding in their skulls...
