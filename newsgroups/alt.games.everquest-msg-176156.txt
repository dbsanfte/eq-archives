Is there a droppable BP with more than 32 AC <at L25>?  Heraldic is
recommended L45, so at 25 you only get about 55% of its bonuses.
Also, the softcap testing I've read about was done by high levels
fighting mobs like Katta Guards, for sub-L30 mobs the effective
softcap would be more like 700-800 (basing this on high twenties
mobs still doing noticeably more damage than low twenties against
an AC in the 600s).

I agree emphaticly.  With a crappy STA and little in the way of HP
gear Kaev did well tanking in his 30s and 40s because I followed
that creed religiously (hey, he's a Paladin, gotta be religious
about something).  But there is a point of diminishing returns
(the softcap).  The twink in question should probably replace the
Fungi somewhere around L40 to L45, as the softcap for the mobs he
fights climbs to meet his AC.  Also, as noted above, at 45 he can
get full benefit from player-made armor (and can use clicky effects
on the Kunark armor, Warriors get a couple nice effects there iirc).

Don't think there's anything better than Royal Velium (32 AC) at that
low a level.

If he's doing random pickup groups it could well save him a few deaths.
And depending on his groups and where he's fighting it will also
speed the pace of his group's kills.  That 150hp a minute regen is
pretty damned nice when that's more than 10% of your HP.

If money were no object, I'd probably go with a Fungi until L40 or so.
The regen is a nice advantage at low levels, you can keep your AC ahead
of the effective softcap for the mobs you're fighting with the gear you
have in your other slots, and the best droppable stuff I know of has
soft level restrictions that greatly reduce its effectiveness at low
levels.
