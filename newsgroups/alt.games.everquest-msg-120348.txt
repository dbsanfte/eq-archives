Great news for mages, necros and beastlords. Now their pets will actually be
welcomed in groups and are made raidable. What missing in this patch are the
interclass balancing between casters. Clerics and enchanters are still way
too powerfull and shammie spells are still way too rare. Druids? They're
still screwed.
