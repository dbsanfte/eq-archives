Hadn't got back to read these in a bit.
Thanks for all your posts.  I'm liking the idea of a Shaman as it is
my favorite class, but I never realy played a rogue past lvl 10 so I
think I will go there.  Also, I want to roleplay not  be Uber on this
server.  But a Shammie would be more popular and can sell heal whan
hes alone.

Please, someone convince me to pick the rogue.....

Thanks for all your posts!
