Recommended level is only the recommended level of an item, go figure.

If I say you MUST be this tall to ride this ride, you must be that
tall to ride the ride. If I say its RECOMMENDED that you are that tall
to ride the ride, you can ride it anyway regardless of height.

As far as EQ is concerned, an item only has the something reduced on
it if the recommended level is 55 but you are level 35. However, in
this case all the thing does is gate so there is nothing to reduce on
it without making it not work. Since "recommended", basically by
definition and as far as EQ is concerned, does not mean you can't use
it you can still port with it since there is no other feature to turn
off.
