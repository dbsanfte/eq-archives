The runner is easily killed by a level 30 beastlord, your main problem
will be faction, never having been to Katta as a DE, I'm not sure if
its Katta or Sanctus Seru which is KOS to evil, maybe both.

You might get away with it if you are agnostic (not likely as a necro
:P)

Having done a quest in SS and spoilt my KK faction a little, I was
suprised to find the Rallic himself was still indifferent to me, thus
it MAY be possible to Gathr shadows and sneak past the guards into the
room he is in, but don't take that as a guarantee.


Mrowh 55/54 Beastlord on Karana.

Frostfist (41) Beastlord on Stromm.

Otserp (32) Mage on Venril Sathir.

Wikkan (42) Druid on Karana, Nekk (32) Necromancer, Moorbane (26) Warrior, Zinga (32) Bard, etc....
