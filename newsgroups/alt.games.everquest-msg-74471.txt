I did what you suggested.  I found a person selling banded pretty much right away.  It was a great boost in AC and what I got for
the Chainmail more than paid for it.

I noticed a great improvement and I think I did some good tanking for my group this weekend.  I'm now at Level 14.  I'm going to
stay in Ro fighting sand scarabs until I ding 15, then I'll move along.

On another note -DOH!

My minor heals were fizzling all the time.  Someone called me "King Fizzle".  I took a break from fighting and went back to check on
some training (I had leveled twice since visiting the guild in freeport).  I looked at "Alteration" and I had nothing in it.  I
could have sworn that I put at least one training into it just to activate it.  I must not have.

I activated it, trained a little in it.  Walked around healing and buffing everyone I saw and now I'm as good at it as I am at
everything else.  Now my spellcasting is much more effective than it was.  I felt so dumb!


Thanks all for the help..   Mike
