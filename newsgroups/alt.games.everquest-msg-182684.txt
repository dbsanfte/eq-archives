OMG, too many to mention...as you've mentioned, too goddam many
variations of Legolas to get in to here; one name that sticks from
recent memory is Megmegmegmeg Megmegmeg - I forget the exact number of
"megs", but you get the idea.  A guildmate of mine recently took a
perfectly good surname - Spiritwind - which I always thought was
perfect for a druid, and changed it to Huggeroftrees - stupid stupid
stupid.  Anyway, if this thread stays alive long enough, you'll see
some real gems here.
