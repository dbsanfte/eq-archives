I was in Blackburrow fighting gnoll pups for the faction and trying to find
gnoll fur. I had asked a LV6 female character who was some class that didn't
have very impressive HP at that LV and was wearing a robe (like a mage or
something like that?). She in return asked for a SoW. I said sure, but she'd
have to wait because I'm out of mana at the moment. She then said "How about
I punch you in the face for it?" and proceeded with more rude comments and
harassment. I told her she was the first for my /ignore list (really was
first, and have only had 1 other who too kept bugging me for a few minutes).
Looking back on the situation, I see that I could/SHOULD have done something
different when she threatened to hit me.
/say I'd like to see you try to hit me if you think you're so good.
/duel
I was LV15 at the time and fully buffed, she was LV6. You pick fights with
much higher LV characters, you deserve the outcome, especially because /duel
requires the consent of BOTH on non PvP servers.
