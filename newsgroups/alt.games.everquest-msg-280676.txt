Thanks all for answering my last question. That was great to know.

Here is another question. I am Dark Elf Necro. I haven't done tire one solo
quest for the faction. These days I do creator mission but I can never find
evil group so my faction with evil camp is dubious.
Should I start turning in good tokens to raise faction with good camp? If I
do that, am I going to mess up the game in future?
Is this faction could be related to other faction hit?
