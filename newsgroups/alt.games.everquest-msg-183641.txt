Newsflash... in MY posts, *I* decide who and to how many people I write to.

>     PL or actually played?

To PL effectively is to know the mobs,zones and char/gameplay.. so yeah, Id
like to think I know the 1-50 game fairly well.

A Slow mob plus me dodging means I can go even longer without even getting
hit, wheras he's still hitting you (albeit for less damage on average)...
No damage versus a little reduced damage?    Swinss and roundabouts..

Its not something I've parsed or really thought about, im quite open to the
option somebody will use specific numbers and prove me wrong - I'd welcome
that if for nothing more than I'd know ifg my thought was bs or not

>     If a snare is landed an SK can kite the mob in that situation.

Well if Malo, sini, oos etc are needed, snare is ruled out (debuffs before
slow can even be attempted; snare has the same checks*)      *cept disease
based slow, but thats not really common

I dunno.. I doubt an SK would tank better in my group than me,
avoidness+slow+more dps means the mob dies fast anyway (and if you wanted to
get into specifics, CA3, CS3, LR5)
