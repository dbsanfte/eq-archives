I'm an ex-EQ player. I played for a good long time and have all of the
major updates (Ruins of Kunark, Scars of Velious, Shadows of Luclin).
I quit playing many months ago and no longer have a need for these
CD's. I have a friend who started playing recently, and who has only
the basic EQ edition. I'd like to give her all of my CD's since I
don't play anymore, but I'm not sure if she would be able to use them.
My account on EQ has long since been discontinued, and even the
characters that were left on it should have been deleted by now. That
being the case, is she able to use the CD's with the account codes as
they are? Or is she stuck having to purchase all the updates herself,
just to get new account codes that allow her to use them with her
account instead of my old, defunct account?
