Which two nations would those be ? USSR/Russia  and China have never
successfully implemented Communism..... Best I can tell they kinda
fumbled during the whole "TEMPORARY" dictatorship of the proliteriat.
Then again according to the best records I can find Income Tax was a
"temporary measure to finance the war" at least here in canada ......
Temproray ... they keep using that word I do not think it means what
they think it means.
