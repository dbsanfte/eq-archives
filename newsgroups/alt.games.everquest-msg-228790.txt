It is kind of odd that they don't mention this in the press release
though.  Is it possible that these level 70 spells and items are NPC
only?  Or, more specifically, mob only?  Something to give those high
end mobs some extra oomph?  I'd like to see a link to one of these
level 70 spells or items, since a simple perusal of Lucy or Alla
doesn't reveal them...to me at least.

Game on,
