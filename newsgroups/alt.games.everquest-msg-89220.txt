I always thought of as more 'warrior-ish'.  They liked big swords and
wore armor anyway.

For the samurai, I think it would have to be a warrior - nuker hybrid
of somekind.  And that's only because we already have warrior/clerics,
warrior/druids, warrior/shadowknights, and melee/magican hybrids.
Samurai were warriors, so they'd have to be an offensive class.  I
don't see them fitting the melee/enchanter hybrid type.

Or hell, Verant could just say "fuck it" and just create a whole new
class from the ground up.  They ALMOST did it with the Beastmaster's,
but just not quite.  They're melee skills just don't quite map to
either monks or rogues.  In melee, from what little I've admittedly
seen, they're closer to bards.
