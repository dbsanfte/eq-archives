We'll assume that your 51 warrior is only moderately equipped...and say
that you have a wurm primary, and a yak offhand...with 150 base str.

No belt = 728 damage per minute
FBSS   = 881 damage per minute
TBB     = 735 damage per minute
CoF      = 991 damage per minute

There isn't much out there that is more useful than haste. The *only*
reason to use a TBB is if a) you get it for free, and b) you have your
haste in another slot (cloak, neck, weapon, gloves, etc).
