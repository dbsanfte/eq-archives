/shrug the game is still new.  I imagine they'll be kicking people off 
regularly for another month.  But yes, it's definitely annoying.

Keep in mind that it's not always them.  Are you SURE that your ISP works 
flawlessly while you're asleep?  Unless my EQ bazaar mule does a /who when 
he logs back on and sees less than 50 in the bazaar I assume it's my 
connection to their server causing the problem. I mention EQ because I have 
never gotten around to checking in EQ2 on that mule.
