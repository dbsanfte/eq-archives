That statement right there kinda clues one in to needing counseling.
You seem to make the assumption that counseling is for folks ready to
be commited to an institution, that its for hard core people with huge
problems. Heck, Im sure we all could use it from time to time, its not
a bad thing to seek or admit needing.

All in all, you posted here to get sympathy because you got hurt, and
you wanted to hurt her back - hence the listing of her characters and
the confrontation with her husband. Its that simple.

She used you and you used her. You were both filling holes in your
life. You knew it was wrong, yet you continued seeking her. You meant
nothing to her in the cold harsh reality. You can try to convice
others of the contrary - but its BS. Thats the nature of online
relationships, once the holes are filled, or it becomes too serious,
one can just "disconnect" and its done with. Very easy. Take this
whole situation as a learning experience and move on.
