My guess would be to blame it on Sygate.  I set a friend up with a small
home network, he and his wife were both gamers and on cable modem, and he
asked me to install Sygate since it came with his home network starter kit.
After a couple minutes, her system would kick her off-line.  Everything
checked out OK, but this kept happening.  I had him uninstall Sygate and
just use the ICS that comes with Windows and it worked without a hitch.

Good luck,
Sean...
