Hello, i'm curious if there is a way to get around a college firewall.... to 
play EQ...  I have recently used http-tunneling and sockscap32  .. which 
enable me to access the everquest patch.... but i read somewhere where a 
person wasn't able to play the game after he downloaded the patch.....  (i'm 
still downloading the patch at the time of this message).... anyone have any 
ideas or where to point me ?

Blaz
