Heh, I feel your pain.  At least we paladins get to kill undeadies on our
epics.  Hmm, does your idea mean that I could put a ghoulbane in the spot
and give my epic an undead proc?

Sure, but even so, I still see the SSS as being an permanently equipped on
any bard that has it, save the occasional times when he's crossing WK, or
his raid wants the best possible resists.

Just carry the thought farther.  Mage summons epic pet.  Mage summons a
second pet, causing the epic pet to take on whatever parts of the second pet
in lieu of whatever it had for that stat before, sort of a "best of" pet.
That way, he gets the epic pet, with post-epic HP, but without all the other
stats being reduced, and still keeps all the special abilities.
