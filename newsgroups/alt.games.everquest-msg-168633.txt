For a while after POP release, NBG made sense, getting spells into the hands of casters
meant significant power increase.  But honestly, very little loot drops in the planes in
experience groups, and most casters who've been playing there a lot already have all or
nearly all of their 61/62 spells.  Within the past week, I've been insisting that the "pure
melee" classes roll for ethereal parchments in my groups, since the odds are high that any
drop any of us get is going to be for a spell that we are going to sell anyway.

This way, rogues, warriors, and monks have the same chance at getting a 2K to 12K sellable
item as the rest of us.

For those who say those spells shouldnt be sold, but given to guild members or friends...
well thats fine too, but in that case why should casters have a monopoly on generousity?

Personally, I spent big wads of cash early on filling up my spell book.  I knew that prices
would drop, or that I'd get the spells eventually via lottery... but I felt it worth the
"wasted" money to get the powerup earlier.  Now I'm selling duplicate spells as I get them
for half what I paid... and I've almost broken even.  I also handed in three parchments to
the enchanter guy and managed to get my 65 lull (Pacification), instead of paying the 25Kpp
price that was on the only copy I spotted in two weeks of looking.  So I sold a couple
enchanter spells as well.

If I went along with forbidding pure melee a shot at parchments, I'd feel bad about the
small fortune I'm making selling the spells.
