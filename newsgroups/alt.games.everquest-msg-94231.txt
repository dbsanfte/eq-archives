Luclin has a lot of content geared toward something other than the classic 
tank/cheal team/damage dealers raid setup.  New content that requires new 
strategies.

Wouldn't it be nice to have AE taunt?  Hint.  Yeah, a lot of Luclin is 
going to require AA skills to do with a single group.  Or several tanks 
working together.

I'm not sure these would be the best AOE zones, if the mobs have high 
hitpoints, the nukers might be OOM before the mobs are all dead, and then 
it just gets ugly.

Nah, you're not a relic, you just have to change your style a bit.  Bring 
a couple extra tanks with you to taunt, figure out who can AE slow the 
mobs, and how to keep them from dying (or convince them to take one for 
the team), figure out if you can use the geography to your advantage, 
have the druids root and rot, or just root.
