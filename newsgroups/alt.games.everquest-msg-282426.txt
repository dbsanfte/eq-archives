Honestly I hope that this suggestion won't make it live...ever! :) If
everquest gets reduced to a simple beat mob get reward game then I'd be
thoroughly disappointed. I know alot of people argue that this game
already is in that state. Or always had been this way.

Yet if you take your time listening to some of the stories that are
there you'll find it is more. Or at least it is more for me!

If your goal is max lvl/max AA/max gear in a couple of days - sure. But
not all people like spending their free time racing. ;)
