Exactly. LDoN suffers from crap zone design. Other than that it was a
great concept. GoD however, suffers from even crappier zone design.
Recycling the same zones for 7 different trials in ikkinz is the worst
thing I've seen so far. It makes the trials and raids mind numbingly
boring when they're in the same damn zone with slight changes in mob
placement. Hell they even recycled a couple of boss encounters between
the raids.

Dispite their attempts to give the impression they are listening, it's
quite obvious they don't intend to spend any more than a bare minimum on
shoving new expansions out the door. GoD has taken them below the
minimum players will put up with, if the rumors of this change of heart
being attributable to a record low in signups for the next expansion are
true. That coupled with public cries for boycott from Woody and others
across the community obviously have them jumping to try to turn around
this perception but whether they'll actually spend the money to put out
a real, fleshed out expansion again remains to be seen.
