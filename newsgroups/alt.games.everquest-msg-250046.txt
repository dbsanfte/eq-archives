    I just checked all my word documents.  It wasn't me.  It does sound
like a fun project for when I finally do lose my mind, though, don't it?

   I have to admit, when I first read through Ben's post, I was wondering
if it were satirical or for real.  I mean, #1 is "shut off empty instances
of Plane of Time"?  Wha...?  How in the world does this affect 98% of
players of EQ?  I know they said it was all rather random, but still...
#1?  

   Now, some of the top 10 (well, 9, really) I was happy to see, namely
"Improving how we handle beta and the testing process" and "Improve corpse
drag radius".  Both of which seem like they would be good idea.  But over
all, yes, it does sound like they are going to focus on keeping the Big
Boy's Guilds happy, and pretty much ignore what might improve things for
the more causal player (with exceptions, of course.  That whole "Solo
LDoN-Style instances or similar content" might be an attempt to cater to
the people who are not in mega-guilds.  Or maybe they are just listening to
the buzz from CoH and trying to pick up on something that seems to be
working I don't know.

   But over all... the #1 thing they list is fixing something with the
freaking Plane of Time???  Um... I don't think they really get it.
