It's funny that the rice bowl is mentioned.  When I first created my
monk, I didn't read the manual first about the classes, and just
created him based on what sounded right for a monk.  So my monk his
pretty high wisdom :)

As for monk armor for humans, there are some nice newbie armor quests
that you can do from your guild.  I had started a newbie monk in
Freeport, and I know there are some nice armor quests there.  These
pieces are much better, imho, than cured silk.  I'd go for these, plus
you get some experience with the quest mechanism in EQ.

Iksar monks don't have it so good.  SOE hasn't redone the armor quests
for many of the races, including Erudites, Ogres, Iksars, and Trolls. 
I'm not sure about Barbarians either.
