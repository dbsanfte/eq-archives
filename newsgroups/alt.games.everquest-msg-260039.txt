That describes me fairly well, at least for certain values of 'a lot.'
I like having the opportunity to hunt with others, but I severely
dislike feeling obligated to do so or being punished for not doing so.
And there are other values to having other folks in game, even for a
soloist; trading, whether of ingame goods or knowledge, being the
primary one.  Competition, whether directly as in PvP or indirectly as
in the D2 Ladder, being another.
