Sometimes DT you sound like the ministers wife on the Simpsons.. "Won't 
someone think of the children .. PLEASE!!!" I just have to wonder.. are 
you against retaliation if it puts civilians in jeopardy regardless of 
the cost? Do you feel our military or political leadership are a bunch 
of "mad dogs" whose only aim is to destroy? I'm not flaming here.. I'm 
just trying to get a feel for what you think is an appropriate response. 
Personally I don't think carpet bombing or "nukin da hell outta dem" is 
appropriate. 

However, I believe bin Laden is responsible. Today he has now made 
contradictory statements to those he made last week. The Afghani 
government has spoken for him and said they do not believe he was 
involved. If we show proof he was involved and they do NOT hand him over 
then what?

Personally I don't want airstrikes (unless coordinated with ground 
forces). What I want is Marines on the ground moving to either apprehend 
him or shoot him dead. If the Taliban government decides to fight then 
they should be eliminated. Should they bomb innocent civilians .. 
certainly NOT.

I personally know people that worked in the WTC. I have no idea if they 
are alive or dead. I hope that you are not diminishing their lives in 
order to "save" the lives of those who (unwillingly or not) support 
those who have taken lives.
