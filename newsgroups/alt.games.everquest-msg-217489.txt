The group heals are the most handy thing they bring.  I can handle 
keeping myself healed with Torpor, since the slow and snare is rarely a 
problem for me.  Just need to get Quiescence, my last 65 spell, and I'll 
be set for healing melee too.  I figure if between me and one paladin, we 
can keep a BoT group alive with zero downtime, then LDoN should be a 
cakewalk.
