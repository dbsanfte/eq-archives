Although its a leadership ability, I didn't buy this one for anyone but me.

As a berserk, I have an insta cast stun on a 12 second timer, which 
means I can stop almost anything (barring an avoid or an unstunnable 
mob, anything), but a mob serious about casting will be able to get one 
or two more spells out before I can interrupt the next one.

Thus, I figure it behooves me to know what the mob is casting, so I can 
pick and choose what to stop.

The leadership ability I got first, Delegate Group Main Assist, was not 
for me, it was for the enchanter, so I figure that balances things out.
