I had similar problems with a nvidia riva tnt2 ultra.  The game would hang
every so often for quite a few seconds.  It was happening often enough and
for long enough that it interfered with playing quite a bit.  What got me
was that the game had run fine before, and problems had suddenly appeared
with a patch.

I read on a tech problem forum that installing detonator 2 drivers should
help since they supposedly work better with EQ.

I was using detonator 3, but decided to try the detonator 2.  I am not sure
if the problem is completely gone . . .the game still runs a tad choppy in
crowded areas or new areas I have not loaded in a while, but that annoying
"hanging" seems to be gone.

Ugh, please excuse me if I am not speaking clearly, I am very sleepy (darn
game!)
