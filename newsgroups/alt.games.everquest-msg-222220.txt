Of course, in LDoNs, mana efficiency is often less important than time
efficiency. It's the reason you don't see much FD pulling or root rotting
in dungeons even though it's much easier on mana. At least at the levels
I play (L20..L40), we often don't bother with lull if there's only 2 or 3
mobs because it's not worth the time, even counting the higher med time.
