 Firiona Vie.  My main and only character on that server (since you can only
have one) is my level 15 erudite shadow knight named Velsor.  Firiona Vie,
so far, has been very good to me.  I am actually encountering roleplayers in
the course of normal play... and I'm talking genuine roleplayers and not
just people who speak with "thees" and "thous".  Creating FV, in my opinion,
is one of the best things Verant has ever done.  I'm not a huge fan of the
ruleset, but I can tolerate it since it's the unique ruleset that probably
keeps away a lot of the "undesirables."

  Formerly, my most popular character was a (level 42) wood elf druid named
Tukka on Brell Serilis.  A fine and dandy server with some nice people, but
overall nothing special.  Interestingly enough, a recent "What server are
you from?" poll on a Firiona Vie message forum had a lot of people
responding they were from Brell also.  Weird.
