I have a level 9 Cleric.  I'm trying to level him quickly to 35 so he may
join my guild.  I know Oasis is awesome at 15-19 and LoIL will zoom me from
20 to 29 and then on to OT for 30-36.

Is there anywhere that is comparable XP for 9-16.  I usually group as a
Cleric, but would solo Blues. Don't say Orcs in EC or Dervs in NRo or WC.
They are over camped on my server and we spend time waiting for the spawns
to pop.  I'd like constant pulls.

/em kneel
/em thank
