Maybe for raids but the tanks I used to group with always had a pretty
wide selection of weapons to aim for. ... and there were always a few
that were 'good enough' and relatively easy to get. I also never ran
into that problem with my melee characters (but never got one past
60th lvl). 

Spell drops, on the other hand, are what convinced me to walk away
from EQ and have kept me from trying it again. I don't mind the grind
to level 70 but the thought of having to grind runes (and GoD spells)
killed it for me. I just didn't care enough to bother so it was easier
to just walk away from EQ. 

Rgds, Frank
