For whatever its worth, I agree with you this time.  It's really pretty
stupid to be saying you want rangers meleeing, while at the same time giving
them class advantages in bow weapondry.

I'd personally prefer to have bow damage as a legitimate option for
rangers...  instead of ignoring the "no risk problem" by removing archery as
a viable alternative, you add some risk and then bring the damage up to par
with regular weapons.   It would add some variety to the melees, a thing
which is currently pretty lacking.

But failing that, if your "vision" (*grin*) is to have rangers dual wielding
and meleeing, then thier epic weapons _should be_ a pair of one handers.

What they're doing now is like giving wizards an epic that has great melee
stats... but no other benefits.
