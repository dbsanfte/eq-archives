Hehe. On Brell, there are no lists or queues for the Ancient Cyclops.
It is based solely on the PnP... first to *engage* it in combat has
rights to it. Anyone who steps in after that are KSing it.

The theory behind this, is that you can't claim a camp whereby the mob
doesn't spawn in one fixed place[1]. It works quite well on Brell,
which isn't to say that nobody KSes the AC... there are arseholes on
every server.

[1] This is a controversial viewpoint when applied to the
Hunter/Forager cycle in Trakanon's Teeth. In theory it isn't
claimable... but common courtesy usually means that you are able to
lay claim to it.
