I was running a friends' 48 shaman today for a while, and I saw a 43 
chanter LFG.  Grabbed him, and we went off to the slaughter.  He more 
than doubled my damage output, and NOT because of clarity; I got KEI 
while he was on the way to me.

Rather, it was because I ascertained that he was that rare bird, a charm 
capable enchanter.  He grabbed a pet blue to him and cyan to me, and 
-still- did more damage with it than I did with my dogdog pet.

On occaision, coming from a bard legacy as I did, I'd suggest killing 
his heavily wounded pet, which we'd do, then grab a new one and move on.

He'd also mez adds, tash hard targets, and his haste was better than 
mine, which helped my little dog at least pretend to compete.

KEI is far from "all the benefits" of grouping with one of the highest 
DPS classes -and- best lull puller -and- best crowd control classes.

But I understand that this wasn't really the thrust of your arguement, 
which was rather that casters benefit from 4 hour KEI while melee can't 
get better than 1 hour haste
