Once my cleric went LD while being bludgeoned by a Sarnak in LOIL. By the
time my party members came to the rescue, I had gone LD.  They said I
started healing myself (which makes sense, since I had more hp's and less
mana when I came back from the Linkdead.)

My healing spells are always memmed on the very top.  I carry my offensive
spells memmed on the bottom, with Flash of Light almost always on the very
bottom.
