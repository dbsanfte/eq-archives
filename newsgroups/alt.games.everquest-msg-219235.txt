The WMBS hits the delay sweet spot so will probably out-DPS the
Windblade by a few percent consistently no matter your ATK however as
other posters have mentioned you'll get pummeled by ripostes,
especially in PoP.  If you ever get to raid mobs then Knight only 2
handers will drop left right and centre that make both look like junk
though.
