Targetting works fine; if you have playerx targetted when he dies, you lose
target.  If you target the corpse, you get playerx corpse on target, with that
name and showing no HP.  Its just that in your group window the player has HP
left.  Even if you click on that player name to retarget him, you get his corpse
in your target box.

I don't really watch my target box nearly as much as I do my group box, since
I'm not just trying to keep one person alive, I'm trying to keep the whole group
alive; sometimes I have to chuck efficiency out the window and throw some faster
heals out in order to do that, even if it means interrupting a CHeal in
progress.

This isn't a crippling "can't play the game with this" bug, but its very very
annoying, and if it happens a lot it really deserves swift attention.
