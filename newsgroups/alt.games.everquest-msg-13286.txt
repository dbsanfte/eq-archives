Subject: Am I the only one who hates it when people use shout?

I'm relatively new to the game and already have a pet peeve.  Why do so many
people use shout?  It's even in the book that came with the game that it is bad
ettiquette(I'm pretty much a simpleton and if they hadn't put it in the book it
probably wouldn't even bother me, damn that verant).  I play kind of casually
with the sound down, so when I glance at my screen and I see red, I think I'm
being hit.  Does anyone have any unique or useful techniques they employ when
asking someone why they are constantly shouting across a zone or am I just
being too much of a nitpicker?  I'm finding it is not worth the effort to try
and explain to these people that they don't need to shout.  I get childish
answers like, "well everyone else is doing it." How many spots are there on the
ignore list?  Answer for me is gonna be not enough I think.
