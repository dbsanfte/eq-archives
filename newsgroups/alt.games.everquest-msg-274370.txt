I have trouble hearing the voices in WoW and i can't see why from the
controls. The eq2 ones can be disabled, although i tend to leave it on in
town, just for the fun of hearing one of the qeynos inhabitants complain as
a member of the 'evil' races walks past.  The introductory video is
impressive and seems to imply to me that flight within the game might be
feasible; after all, you are seeing a realtime fly through. I kind of wish
I'd played horizons, if only for the flying.

The local EB has effectively moved over console only. there's a few shelves
of pc games, which contained a copy of vellious amongst other things. The
staff hadn't heard of it and didn't care. I haven't had enough time to
assess WoW and I'm going to run out of my month's prescrition before things
ease up, so I hope I like it as much as you do. I'm definitely going to
start a character of each of the races to check out the differences.

I don't like the way the eq2 crafting minigame thinks you have failed to
press the right key even when you have sometimes. I don't like the way the
forge is so lethal that you see messages all the time saying it has killed
someone. The slowness of creating everything, even something that is grey to
you, is wearying me. I'm hoping WoW is better, and that eq2 finds a way to
make tradeskills more interesting.

WoW has wild imagination in it's models, but it's hard to beat the sight of
luclin crushed and burning endlessly across the sky. On the other hand,
lagging to the point where you run in the water, or running to safety only
to die as you negotiate the "which zone would you like today menu", or
drowning because as a dwarf you sometimes zone underwater is not much fun
(don't ask me why they don't make the emptiest zone the default, and a right
click needed if you want to specify similar to the inn rooms).

It's interesting that eq2 seems to have copied the rest state idea of WoW.
Frankly, within the boundaries of law, i hope they pillage each others
ideas. the cross fertilisation can only benefit the players.
