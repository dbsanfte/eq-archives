Well I don't have an Iksar but I do have an "evil" necro and I'm quite safe
in Nexus etc. And the residents are just as happy to talk to me as my
"good" bard.

I'm KOS in katta, and seru, er. whatever it's called....

I'm neutral in Shar Val but outside there is at least one NPC
that took a dislike and killed me.
