Hey..I was in Everfrost Peaks the other night killing Mammoths for tusks
(yeah - I'ma  poacher but i made about 480pp !) when during one of the many
spawn lulls, i got bored and killed the Dark Elf in the south(?) tower.  He
dropped the "head of the supplier" and the gobby that spawned when i
attacked him dropped nothing.  Is this head for a quest?  If so, for what
class and whats the next step?

Thanks.
