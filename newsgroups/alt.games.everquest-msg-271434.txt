It is also up to the warrior to do his best to grab and hold agro.  If the 
warrior just stands around and attacks, he will be more likely to lose agro 
than if he also uses all the tools at his disposal to do so.  Certainly, 
the rest of the group should do their best to avoid taking agro as well, 
but, the warrior does also need to know what he can do to generate as much 
agro as possible.
