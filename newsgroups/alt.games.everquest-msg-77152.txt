If you want to be accepted, and not face the faction problems, I would chose
a Gnome. I have a 22 level Gnome Necro and really enjoy him. However, if you
want to be the epitome of evil, choose a Dark Elf. They get ultravision,
have the second highest int. and look pretty cool. I personally cant seem to
make myself play a human race. (Humans, or Erudites) The lack of nightvision
really bothers me.
