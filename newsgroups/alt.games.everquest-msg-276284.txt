Exactly. One of the servers currently down is my main server, but that's 
fine, I have alts on a few other servers and just switched to one of those 
last night. WoW is fun, despite a few bugs still to be found, but it's also 
still in its infancy. WoW is fun enough to play no matter what character or 
server you're on. In this case, it's definitely part of the vocal minority 
that posted to that forum.
