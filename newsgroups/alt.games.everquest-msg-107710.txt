Hi everyone:

A simple question really: If I kill Ancient Cyclops, what I have to do with
the Ring of the Ancients it in order to multi-quest JBoots for a friend? I
know it would be easier to have him there to loot the ring, but sadly that's
not always possible due to differing playing times. Let's say he has the
3,250 gold and the Shadow Rapier, I have the ring, what's the procedure for
giving the items to Hasten?

Thank you as always for your time, safe hunting to you all ..

Stevie.
