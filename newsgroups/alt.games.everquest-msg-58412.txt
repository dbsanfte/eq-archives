I had assumed the key was whether the item has a Range: statistic when you
Inspect it. For instance, the Chill Dagger is range-equipable as well as
secondary, has +10 SvCold (meaning until I get something better I have one
for each slot in mu CR kit!), and has Range:40. This means that you CAN
throw it.
