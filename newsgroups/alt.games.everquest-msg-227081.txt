This is more for young rangers who want to tank than for the plate tanks,
but it may apply to them as well.  (I err on the side of "may" until I see
parses for those classes.)

During my many visits to Heili in SolC I of course got a Shadowflame (2hs,
41/44, 2magic damage, +3% parry, 10ac, lotsa yummy stats). I hung onto it
because, in theory, the 10ac, parry mod, and low delay might make for a
better thanking weapon than my Sally (AKA Got4W, 2hb, 41/31, no ac or
mods).  I'm so fond of Sally that I never bothered using Shadowflame until
last night when we were doing parses of debuffs.

And to my considerable surprise, mob DPS on me went down by about 10-15
(this against Dark Masters, who are unslowable but fast hitters, and HoH
mobs, who can be slowed, but spike sorta nasty).  That was definitely
enough for the healers to sit up and say nice things about Foxeye.

So if you are a ranger who ends up tanking and feels sorry for your
healers...tell said healers about Ring of Flamewarding in SolC that drops
from Spiritmaster Heili, and they'll be only too happy to kill Heili time
after time, getting you your sword in the process. *grin* 

Looks a helluva lot more snazzy than a windblade too, and is FREE!
