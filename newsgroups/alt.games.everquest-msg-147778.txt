I have had to do this before.  Here is how I did it.  Buy a chipped bone
rod.  This has 3 charges of Locate Corpse.  Ride the boat to near the zone
out.  Hop off, use one charge of locate corpse.  Swim in the direction it
turns you to until you hit the zone line.  Swim down, your corpse should be
there.  Loot it, keeping an eye on your breath remaining.

Alternatively, what server do you play on?  If E Marr, I'd be glad to help
you if we can be on at the same time.  If on another server, there is likely
someone here that would be willing to help if feasible.
