Bad mage for charging so much ! D Pockets are no rent, meaning can't sell to
merchants, and IMHO should not be sold to others. I always give them away to
people who ask nicely and don't ask me when I'm in the middle of a fight.
Yeah, I know it's not against the rules to charge for them but other than
food/water, I just don't like it for some reason. Food/water summoning is a
little different. Because it takes so long to summon stacks of each, it does
cut into my personal time to play.
