Bizbee, you probably don't remember but there was a discussion about 
having everybody petition about some problem and flooding the guides with 
petitions. Since they handle the petitions one at a time, first come 
first serve, how would you have liked it if the guide was wading thru a 
flood of duplicate petty petitions when you were in dire need of help? 
That is the point I was trying to make a while back.
