It should be setable.  Basically have an "account friends" list on the
server, which would be a list of other players that you want to allow to be
friends of you, rather than friends of just any particular character of
yours.

When player X has player Y on X's friends list, if X's account is on Y's
account friends list, then X's friends list would show Y's alts when one of
them is on instead of Y (and identify them as such).
