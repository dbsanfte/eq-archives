That's fair. I encountered them daily... (on an eq site i visited once 
it was with every click). But it only takes one site with info you want 
regularly for it to go from benign annoyance to continual hassle.

Some of the p2p info sites, some of the video game review/news sites, 
some tech news sites, many of the sites that target women are 
particularly bad (health subjects, self-help 
"10-ways-to...insert-subject-here", celebrity news & gossip... etc, 
humour....

You know...'news and information' sites that exist primarily to serve 
advertising for revenue, with drivel content to drive hits (especially 
google hits). Oh... and 'free p0rn' and 'warez' sites of course... but 
that goes without saying...

If you stick to mostly official vendor sites and major news outlets then 
yeah you'll rarely bump into them.

But relying on the fact that you don't go to problem places is sort of 
like leaving your doors unlocked because you live in the good part of 
town. Sure you'll likely not have it exploited... but its still a lousy 
security policy :)
