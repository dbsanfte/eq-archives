Well, if you can read and understand Don Quixote in Spanish, you deserve
to take a moment to twist your arm into an uncomfortable position and
pat yourself on the back, because it doesn't get any more complete than
that. In fact, for many years, the Royal Academy used Don Quixote as the
canon to determine if a word belonged in the Spanish language. If it was
in the Book, it was in the books.

On the other hand, Cervantes was basically a one-trick pony. If your
Spanish is up to scratch, try Quevedo, but be warned, Quevedo is *hard*.
Not because the language has changed much (Cervantes's and Quevedo's
Spanish is more accessible to contemporary readers than Shakespeare's
English is), but because he crams the meanings into each sentence like
you wouldn't believe. Each verse of his poetry and each paragraph of his
prose is almost always a double, triple or quadruple entendre.
