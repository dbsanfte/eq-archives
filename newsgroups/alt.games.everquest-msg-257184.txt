Except the devs have stated the epic 2.0 will be near or at the top of
the weapon heap in terms of ratio, rendering the rest of your post
incorrect in context of epic 2.0 and therefore irrelevent, since
effects will be in force whether or not you're using it for damage,
but everyone else *will* be using theirs for damage, and rangers
*won't* be.
