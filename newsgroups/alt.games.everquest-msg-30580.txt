Being killed is part of PvP servers too...thats where the sense of danger
comes in.  The only people who whine about being killed are the stupid ones
(bound accross the continent or carrying loads of $$$ on them)

"*shrug* Compare the average population on the (only) 4 pvp servers to
the average populations on the rest. Consider how the "blue" servers
vastly outnumber the pvp servers. You'll see how widely your opinion
is shared."

The reason why people like blue servers is because it is MUCH easier to
level on them because you factor out all danger but the NPC's danger.

I would like to hear opinions of people who play on PvP...
