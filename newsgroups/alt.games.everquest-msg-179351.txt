The women in it were really hot, the depiction of the two prophets was cool
when they breathed fire on those guys.

The Antichrist: I am troubled by the developments at the wailing wall,
dee-vided ree-ligions mean a dee-vided world. These men, these self
proclaimed preachers, are dangerous,

Media Mogul Guy: Why don't you just arrest them?

The Antichrist: <pauses, and thinks, coughs nervously> I don't want to put
them in jail, This is not a dictatorship, I simply don't want to see anyone
else getting hurt.........

It was a good movie, not really what I'm into. I think we may see a split of
the church in the end between the solid grounded in reality boring goody-two
shoes Christians and the mystical and prophetic artsy funloving Christians
which seem to have been completely alienated from the church let alone being
drugged into submission. I can also see that God is creating places for
Christians to go if they want during this period, and may have to before
long, one in America and one in Europe(guess where the one in Europe might
be). I can also see that God is creating a leadership structure for America
and Europe, which will be very different places and will probably not have
much to do with each other after the first 100 years or so of the new age as
the North American zone will want to do one thing and the European zone will
want to do another. I don't know about the Asian zone, that is a completely
different world with different rules, seems like they have all rejected God,
they may bounce back though and I've seen some evidence of that.

This movie dealt with the period after the rapture, the prophets are
actually supposed to appear before the rapture, but apparently the people
who made this movie thought differently and who am I to say whether or not
there will be two Jewish rabbis literally breathing fire on people out of
their mouths which admittedly is quite inefficient why would they both need
to be in the same place?
