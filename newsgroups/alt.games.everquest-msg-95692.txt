Enchanter being my main for more than a year I'll say that I want to hunt
with someone who can keep me alive.  Monks can't, rangers can't, mages
can't...necros...maybe, if they're the sort who likes to heal.  But necros
are the only class I can't demand they do my bidding 'cause they don't
particularly give a crap about either clarity or haste. <g>

My personal favorite is and always will be druid and "enchanter/druid lfg"
is much more likely to find a group than "enchanter/cleric" pre-50.
