It was really stupid for any of you to hunt in KC without a healer so I'm
thinking all three of you are to blame.

A different answer, one you'd prefer to hear, a bard (assuming you're at
least level 52) shouldn't have too much trouble with one simple add...why
call RUN when you'll eventually mez him?  Orrrrr, when the tank was down to
40% health with 2 critters beating on him, why didn't you guys just ALL call
RUN and take the 5 steps to zone?
