They do?  The MO that I've been able to see is to stick with their mistakes
until it's too late for a good fix, then to make small changes that
alleviate it without admitting that there are any underlying problems.

This describes PoP, GoD, OoW, at least.  All of them are pretty reasonable
nowadays.  I stopped caring after that point (I still play, but I no longer
give a damn about progression or achievement, I'm just there to kill some
stuff and an hour or three).

>I suppose losing half their customers to WOW was a wake up call for them. 

It's unclear exactly WHAT lesson they learned from it, though.
