DX 8.1 sucks... basically it's buggy, not fully tested with the latest
video/sound cards and will not run some older software. 8.0a works perfect.
It's funny, Verant seems to be the only game company that insists on DX8.1..
Verant needs to lay off the pipe. New games released since SOL come with
DX8.0a still... Now about XP I won't go into too much but I am certainly Not
a fan of it and refuse to run it. I've had XP LONG before it went public
(thanks to a friend who works for the big "I", think P's as in
MB/Processors) and it sucked then as it does now. Again it's buggy, refuses
to run some older software etc, reminds me sort of like when W95 came out
but not as bad. I stick to W98 (dont like ME), DX8.0a and it works perfect.
Everyone I know personally who is running XP complains about something or
another...

"If it ain't broke, why fix it..."
