Another EQ2/SOE refugee here - for months bashed the idea of WoW and
trudged along the EQ2 beta

After release though I on whim got tired of EQ2's mind numbing
funneling of players and lack of variety and tried WoW

Still trying to get my foot out of my mouth for ever disparing a game
without trying it and finding out the WoW community was actually a
little more fun and friendlier overall than the EQ2 one was a nice
thing also

We probably have over 20 in our guild alone who quit EQ2 for WoW and
the number is growing everyday

Perez is always trying to hope this hopeless crap game that Sony has
designed

Bob: no one cares. Get over yourself.

WoW is MUCH more solo-friendly than EQ2. It isn't too hard to solo in
Norrath until about level 15, but it becomes quite arduous... almost
impossible.. thereafter. As a casual player (except for long stretches
of play on weekend evenings), I have found it very hard to just log in
for an hour and have any fun at all.

I really like the graphics in EQ2 and was initially turned off by WoW's
cartoonish graphics.. which have since grown on me. However, nice
eye-candy doesn't make a game fun.

I will probably hold off for a week or two before cancelling my EQ2
account, but it looks like Azeroth is going to have to make room for
one more semi-permanent resident  pop: 600,001?
