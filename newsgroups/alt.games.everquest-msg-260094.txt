Probably not by a 55 berserker, but, ring 8 is quite soloable by a level
65 of many different classes.  I soloed it easily.  Ring 9 I did with 2
friends, but, I think is soloable as well at level 65.  Ring 10, is most
definitely not soloable, and at this point, I have given up on doing it, 
as my guild is well past having any interest in doing that, and we have 6 
or 7 folks stalled on ring 9 now.  At least ring 9 has a insta clicky 
usable indoors.
