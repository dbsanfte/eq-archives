It's been about a year since I last formatted my PC and its getting a bit
sluggish. The thing is I have alot of data that I dont want to lose this
time. I have 2 harddrives in my PC the main(20GB) one holds windows and all
my programs. The secondary(6.4GB) one has about 4 GB of MP3's on it that I
definatelt cant lose it also houses the windows swap file.

My question is, can I just transfer everything I want to keep to the
secondary HD and reformat the main one?
Should I then transfer the files to a temp folder on my main one and format
the secondary one? Will it make any difference at all? (file fragmentation
and such)
