I have soloed probably 50-70% of my EQ2 playtime, and am having no 
difficulty at all doing so.  I cannot compare it to WoW, have never tried 
WoW.  There is content in EQ2 that cannot be soloed, but there is quite a 
bit that is soloable, including many quests.  Many of the quests that I 
could not complete earlier, I am finding I can complete solo now, when the 
group encounter mobs are green (still give xp, not bad xp even as a group 
encounter), or, in some cases, grey (no xp).
