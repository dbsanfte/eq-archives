    I would've practically given you a medal on the spot for owning up and
apologising if that was my pull you'd interrupted - im being serious not a
smartass too. I've only RARELY had people own up to accidental KSing, and
even when they kind of do they tend to act as though it was justified. IE
they made a mistake but I'd failed to put up enough neon lights and howling
sirens to indicate it was my mob therefore its ok for them to KS and loot.

    I wish many horrid things upon your abusive guy.

Cheers,
James
