Use the /chatfontsize command or the ChatFontSize=[0-5] line in eqclient.ini
to increase the font size (when you use /chatfontsize the eqclient.ini entry
will be automatically updated when you quit, so it's best to use the command
in game so you know what you're getting right away).  The only problem with
that is since Verant decided to make a max size for the chat window, if you
increase it by one or two and already have the maximum window size you won't
be able to see as many lines at one time.  On my 19 inch monitor I use the
default 1 in 1280x1024, but at 1600x1200 I have to increase it to 2 or I
start getting a headache ;)
