i tried to skill up archery just a few weeks ago.  i'd been fletching for
awhile and was able to make class 2 bone hooked arrows (3 damage and about
150 range i think....) then i went to DSP (the shrooms were dark blue to me
a the time) and i rooted one and shot at it with my bow (30 damage and like
35 attack delay or something, i don't remember) it took about half an hour
to actually kill the damn thing, then i noticed that my archery hadn't gone
up at all.  went and checked eq casters and realized that archery for a
pally caps at 75 (i know pally's really just use archery for pulling and
there's no really good reason to increase it, but i was bored and i thought
it'd be easy to get up).  Anyways, it used about 5 stacks of arrows for 1
shroom, and i ended up getting screwed over cuz i already had archery capped
(doh!).  i did, however, get my fletching from like 70 something to 95ish,
so it wasn't a total loss i guess....

i guess i kinda started to ramble there.  anywho, if i could get archery
above 75, that would have done it.  and 5 stacks of arrows=100 shots, so it
would probably help you alot.
