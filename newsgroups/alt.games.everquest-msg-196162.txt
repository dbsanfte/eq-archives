Again.  You don't need to use kei if you don't want to.  Just do like I said
and find other people that like to play like you do.  But listen, if 99% of
the people in the game like to use kei and you are here railing against them
doing as they like, that comes off both foolish and tyrannical.  You are not
going to change their minds and you are not going to remove a *choice* that
practically everyone prefers having.  Your only chance is convincing verant
that it is an exploit, but I don't see that happening either.
