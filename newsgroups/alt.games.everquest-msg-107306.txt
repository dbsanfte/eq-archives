I made a ranger for fun a while back and put massive dex bonus items on him
just so his Venomous Axe of the Velium Brood (before they nerfed it, haha
VI..I made level 35 the day before your patch) would produce it's effect a
ton.  Man, it made levelling fun.

Now I am on a mission to make his dex out of this world.  It is currently
177, but I want more...more I tell you!  Can anyone think of quests I could
do to improve the AC and dex of his equipment?  A list of his current
equipment follows.

Thanks,

Dinolas
