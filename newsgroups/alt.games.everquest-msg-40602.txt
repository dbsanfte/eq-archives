Only vendors I know of that sell infinite bat wings (as opposed to just
having them because a newbie sold them to the vendor) are in east commons
and kael drakkel. I'm sure there are others.

EC vendor is in the inn right next to the WC zoneline...sorry, I have never
xp'd in EC, so I don't know the numbering of the inns.

The Kael vendor is behind Tormax's throne room, on the right side with the
Tormax banker, and the bard armor quest giver. He also has malachites for
magicians, and peridots for clerics.
