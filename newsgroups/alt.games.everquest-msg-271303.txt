Don't forget that they are also nodrop, so you will want one or two
hand-made backpacks in the bank as well.  (For entire-bag swapping in
the shared slots and to other players...it will come up)

Price on items tend to drop.  This is not always true, but in general,
prices drop as the number of people able to farm an item increases and
the percentage of them who don't need it also increase, yeilding
greater and greater supply.  Meanwhile, expansions tend to make a lot
of stuff obsolete.  Don't get caught holding on to an item because it
used to sell for more.  Chances are, those glory days are gone.

Also try to determine which classes would be most likely to buy said
item, then look up similar items and see what they go for, for those
classes.  Why would a Druid want your leather pants if someone else is
selling ones with a little more AC, the same HP, and more Wis for less
money?

Another tip, though, is to remember that things are just really friggen
complicated.  You will often see an older item with much crappier stats
than comparable newer-expansion items, but the older item is priced
much higher.  The reason?  The older item, while inferior in all other
ways, is not level restricted.  Or you will see an item with 21% haste
selling for double that of an item with 24% haste.  Why?  The 21% haste
item has a little bit of wisdom or intelligence on it and is wearable
by casters.  It's a niche item: pure casters that wanna melee too.  Or
perhaps the 21% haste item goes in an irregular spot, so it would be
great for that minority of people who have some really nice items for
the waist and back slots and wont want to take them up with their haste
item.  I guess the take home point is to try to recognize why some
items are unique, try to look at it from all angles...

I find that so annoying.  New traders go up *all the friggen time*.  We
*don't* need to know that you just hit the "start trader" button.

With that off my chest, yes announcing your items and their prices is a
good idea.  If for no other reason, it tells people that you are at the
keyboard and are capable of wheeling and dealing.  They are free to
barter as well as (if you are interested) free to try to bring down
your prices.  I also suggest you join your server's auctions channel.
Morell-Thule's is auctions:auctions.  Yours might be similar.  Announce
your items at the same time in both your server's auctions channel and
the /auc channel.  This way you will be selling to people in the bazaar
as well as anyone in the server channel, which could be people raiding
PoTime.

Note that I wrote "/auc", not ooc.  Some people, even in the bazaar,
get really annoyed when you use /ooc.  The channels' intent should be
respected.  Never sell anything in /ooc.  Always buy or sell in /auc.
The reason is that people can mute out the auctions without muting out
the other zone-wide messages that they may prefer to see.  This is not
as important to people as it used to be (when the "bazaar" was
typically a central area in the game and located in a regular exp
zone--MT's was in the East Commonlands).  However many people still get
annoyed by misuse of the ooc channel.  Also, if you stay in this habit,
you won't have to feel guilty about auctioning shit off while in exp
zones...at least not in my opinion.  Auctions your crap everywhere, but
always use /auc.
