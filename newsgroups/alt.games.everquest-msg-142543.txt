Skyshrine has 3, tiny coin purse, medium coined purse, and very large coined
purse.

The first 2 drop from random wyverns and cubes (over a period of 3ish weeks
exping there 24/7 daily, I saw about 6 drop total)

The last one is an ultra rare from the boss of Skyshrine, Lord Yelinak.

i have the medium and very large, and nope, they don't stack.   (very large
is 70% weight loss on coins and items, and the others scale down)
