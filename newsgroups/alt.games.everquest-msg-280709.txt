My experience in the past month, since my return to the game, suggests 
that I could stand naked in POK using an exploit to kill the vendors 
there at first level, and I still wouldnt' see a GM; I've not only not 
seen a single one, but I've not heard a single person say that a 
petition was answered (and numerous people have complained long and hard 
about them NOT being answered).  However, I don't avoid exploits merely 
for fear of getting caught, if the general consensus is that this is a 
"bad thing" I'd be happy to give it up, after all, I've already had most 
of the amusement out of discovering it in the first place.

If they change the aggro status of the coldain to giants, they're going 
to run into some serious problems with some of the ring quests, where 
IIRC the most difficult part is preventing the damn coldain from 
engaging mobs they have no hope of killing!

Well, I'm not killing the guards, or at least rarely so (never killed 
one in NL, occaisionally lose one in GD).  And I've almost never seen 
anyone running to the coldain for protection, even way back in the days 
when Velious was the latest release... they are too far from the giants, 
if you can make it to them, you can make it to the zone line, too.  And 
they are plentiful; they exist in the same order of magnitude as the 
giants and drakkal wolves.  AND, they are quite legitimately treated as 
prey by people who are working on giant faction instead of coldain 
faction.  Lastly, I'll note that I'm seeing about 5 people in the entire 
zone, max, most much higher level than me; GD just isn't rocking these days!

I agree, this is a potential item of concern, killing off guards which 
are actually used as protection would be rude, although I don't think 
thats actually the same thing as cheating.

SOW potions, although extremely handy for a bard, aren't allowable 
within the terms of the ED oath; I'm sworn to use nothing but things 
I've looted, quested or bought from the unlimited stocks on vendors. 
Yes, SOW potions would fit within the "trade skills" exception: if I buy 
or loot the ingrediants myself, I can have another ED member make them 
for me... but ED doesn't thus far have a shaman capable of making SOW 
potions.

Kiting, as a 30 bard, isn't much of an option, I've got ONE ranged DOT, 
and of course Bellow, which is very short range.  Yes, I've done it, 
heck I've done it with just Bellow, but its slow going indeed.  Thinking 
back to my previous bard, I recall that even with twisting 5 dots (using 
TBoots for speed instead of selos, or later using the long duration 
selos) and a significantly better drum than my current untwinked self 
can field, chant kiting was always slow going compared to using charm or 
fear kiting.

I certainly can, however, kill mobs in EW by various other means, and 
have.  Bards are the swiss army knife of classes; I've got a half dozen 
ways to hunt and do well... this was more along the means of an 
experiment with new (well new to me anyway) ways.  I've been enjoying it 
because it's something different, and it does have its unique 
advantages, but its far from foolproof and actually not the most 
efficient means of gathering exp (swarm charm kiting, done properly, 
will usually be faster even if you don't count the time spent running 
the victim to the guards... which is significant).
