Besides the first day,when everyone rushed the patching server, I 
haven't heard of anyone having a problem with the patching... and if 
some still have a problem, it's certainly not a problem of coding.

People are having problems(crashing etc..) with the new user interface 
IN the game, not while patching. Hence my post. I think the patching 
server has been tested many many times since EQ was first released in 
99, I don't think it is bugged or something now :) . Sorry but you badly 
missed the point there (and yes there is one).

Next time save your pride and refrain from posting such stupidities when 
you don't know what you're talking about, thanks.
