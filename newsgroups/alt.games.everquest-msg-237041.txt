Now, now.  That's not sufficient evidence to make him a liar.  It could be 
argued that it just makes him an idiot.  To me, at least, a lie is a 
deliberate misstatement of fact.  If he honestly believed what he said to 
be true, the deliberateness would be missing.  But, of course, honestly 
believing that would be more than sufficient proof of idiocy.

Since we can't tell what he honestly believes, we'll have to leave it up 
to him.  Liar, or idiot?  Your call, @ndrew.
