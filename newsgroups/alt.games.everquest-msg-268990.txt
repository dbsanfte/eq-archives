Hi all....

I 2-box a 66 Druid and 66 Necro normally , but have alts on the
accounts I sometimes play. Well got bored one day and decided to start
my Beastlord's Epic. Got the Grimling part, then all the Spirits with
in a 24 hour period, then got the Extras like Maiden Eye (gem of the
voidx2), The Deep (Fungal thingie), etc. Hence am down to 2 battles
now.

Finally got to Timorous deep and the scout was up, so moved my Necro
and Beastlord there (they share one account). Proceeded to do the turn
in and kill the 6 images one at a time. Killed the first then logged
on Beastlord to loot, rinse repeat. Down to the last one and I decided
to send the pet in and lo and behold he went down and I logged off to
the beastlord and went over to where the last one died and could not
easily find him, I used /target and was able to do that, then tried
/loot and it said too far to loot. Did this for a few minutes even
jumping on top of the hut, but not luck. The Corpse rotted. I am stuck
with a bag with 5 of the 6 glass shards in it, and sent a petition.

Does this mean I need to start everything over again? I seem to have
the emblem from the Elder but dont have the box any more. Getting the
feeling I need to actually go back to square one -- as I know I can
rely at all on GM for any thing. Anyone ever been in this situation?

I didn't spend more than 2 days on the whole thing from start till TD
(showing how easy the Beastlord epic is up to that point), so starting
over does not phase me at all but it is good to know in the future to
pull this guy to the beach and not fight near the hut. There were a
few times where I was not able to cast on the NPC or heal my pet which
kinda makes sense as to why could not loot.
