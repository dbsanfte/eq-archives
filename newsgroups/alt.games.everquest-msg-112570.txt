Qeynos sucks. Great for lowbie level gaining but there is no trade to speak
of. I pity the person trying to find a buyer for anything or a trade person
for something like jewelry or armor. I think I sold two Steins of Moggok for
180 and 80 pp respectively and half a set of large banded to a barbarian for
3 pp in the last 3 years. Everything else I just gave away. Like going to a
ghetto. I still feel bad about charging that barbarian 3 pp because he was
one broke barbarian.

Which leaves Tommy with the problem of get out of Qeynos and =>

Being a human paladin sucks. Warrens as someone suggested is good if he
survives the boat ride, makes it by the necro guards, and can find his way
blind to the entrance. I have had a SoW'd druid get agresso from one of the
NPCs through the walls while running to Warrens/Stonebrunt. Really it is
just another form of "Get out of Qeynos" advice after all.

Going someplace like FP where you can actually sell and buy will probably
suck for a pali. Maybe advice like "/w all 29 60" and give a tell to
everyone that is anonymous "/t can u port me to wc?" would be the best.<sic>
