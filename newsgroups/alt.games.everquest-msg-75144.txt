Well, I don't know about "tough" zones, but with my alt (a chanter, who was 
16 at the time) and a mage(also 16) we were chain pulling DW crocs for over 
an hour in Oasis without a break. We both had a pet up, and I was 
pulling... Pull with tash, let the water pet and my pet go in, med... I was 
hasting pets as my major mana expenditure and the Mage was nuking as 
needed. I was amazed at how quickly these beasts (red cons at 16) were 
going down. The experience gains were insane.

Another unconventional group I had centered on a ranger as the tank, with 
my druid as the healer/buffer/dser, and a monk pulling and meleeing. We 
kept the entire back end of the Sarnak Fort in Lake of Ill Manners from 
spawning, when about half of them were even cons, a bunch of blues and some 
yellows... We even (accidentally) pulled a Revenant and whipped him silly.

Druids are wonderful for unconventionalo groups because they are so 
flexible. Some characters (rogues and clerics and wizards come to mind) are 
locked into one role, but a druid can play many roles well in a party, and 
can change as needed. Hell, with my druid I even ghetto-mez sometimes, 
which consists of a nuke, a dot, then running away from the group a bit 
(with a mad mob in tow) and rooting it in the boondocks.
