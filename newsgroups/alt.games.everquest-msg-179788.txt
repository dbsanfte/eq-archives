You assume in-game is the only interaction I've had with other
players. And I didn't say I knew 90% of the uber guilds. Pick up a
copy of Hooked On Phonics, it appears you're in desperate need of some
reading lessons...

The statement was made to illustrate that no one was forced to buy the
game by SOE because of it. Of course, you're either too dense or
simply unwilling to grasp that, because I made it plainly obvious.

And it's not necissary. You've illustrated that it's convenient, but
you've given no reason to beleive it's NEEDED. Raids ran perfectly
fine without it for years, after all.

Yes, and I've heard of people hunting in normal groups and even
soloing to 65 in PoP zones. But that's irrelevant, because no PoP
means that it's not possible to reach 65. The cap is 60 without it.
You can't even hit 61 without PoP.

But, then again, it's not necissary to go above 60 without PoP because
everything outside PoP is geared toward the level 60 max. If you buy
PoP because you feel you *have to* get to 65 and you *have to* be in
the asshole uberguilds, that's your choice, no one else forced you to
make it.

By the way, Vae Imnicus (sp?) on Tunare last I heard (couple months
ago) didn't require all its members to have PoP. I haven't checked
with them all, but I am quite certain that you can find a good number
of "raiding guilds" that don't *require* PoP. Only the l33t d00dz
guilds who think EQ is a competition...

Keep that shit up, kiddo. Your only hurting your own image with it.
