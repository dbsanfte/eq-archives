Actually, most of these proscriptions weren't abandoned under the
Lateran Councils of 1185-1215 and some under the Nicean Conference in
the 5th Century AD.

Mostly, I think they got in the way of the early Christians being able
to recruit the local cheeseburger eating populations who though the
rules a bit stuffy.

Of course if you go back and review Jesus' preaching in the context of
the Hellenist and Essene movements, it makes a lot more sense than
trying to pretend he was God incarnate or other such silliness.  So
much of this was just Paul's taking over the Church and pushing the
other apostles out the metaphorical window.
