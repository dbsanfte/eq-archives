Um, that's interesting.  And here I thought it was this nice old
German word most often used where we would use "over" in English.
The earliest reference I can think of that is often translated into
English as "super" would be Nietzsche's "ubermensch", which seems
to be most often translated as superman (super/over/above are all
synonyms anyway).  At any rate, I don't think the military usage
you mention below predates Nietzsche's.

Not completely.  I'm not the only person who sees the use of "uber"
as a brag or compliment in EQ to be a "moron alert" warning.  It's
not as sure a thing as an ultra-lame name, but it's still a pretty
good indicator.
