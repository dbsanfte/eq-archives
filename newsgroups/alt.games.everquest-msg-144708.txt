 I had a hard time finding those settings as well. They are in your Desktop
Settings menu, right click on the desktop, select PROPERTIES, goto the
SETTINGS tab, click ADVANCED at the bottom of the window. The next window
has a GeForce4 4400 tab on it, click there and a little side menubar popped
out of mine, with about 7 menus on it. Lots of cool stuff in there!!!
