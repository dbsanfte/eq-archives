Because they provide resources and skills Sigil does not, nor wants
to, possess?  Like marketing, packaging, distribution, anything not
game dev related?
There are a lot of examples in the world of just this type of
partnering.

Did you read any history on this?  The backing was from Microsoft.
now they're buying the rights from MS.

Maybe.  Maybe Sigil goes bigger than Lineage and they buy Sony.  The
rationale for Sony purposely blowing the distro is flawed.  They are
hurting for revenue.  Vanguard is the most anticipated game in
history, to date.  Sigil is very unlikely to go under since it's a
small dev house.  More likely Sony eats it hard if Vanguard flops,
much harder than Sigil.

Were you aware Verant was *sold* outright to Sony?  Sigil is not on
the auction block nor is it likely to be.

EQ2 yes, EQ1 no.  While they owned the IP of EQ1 there were alot of
royalties that had to be paid to dev's.  So while they got the lion's
share to be sure they still had to pay out some.

There are legal barriers that your example blows right past, so I
think the comparison is very flawed.
While SOE may indeed want to purchase Vanguard or even Sigil at some
point it is usually hard to force a sale when the company is privately
held by people who are not hurting for money.
Not that it couldn't be done but things are different now than in the
Verant days.

That's too bad for you.  EQ prime (as I refer to it) was the most
incredible computer game ever made imo.  Personally I think it still
is but I'm biased to the core.  But having played at WoW and heard
about DDO I think what I get out of EQ is still the best out there.

And if Vanguard is what EQ prime should have been then sign me up
Scotty!
Only time will tell of course but I'm open to the possibility based on
the dev's history.
