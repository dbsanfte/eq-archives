Warrior: Plate, Rogue: Chain, Berserker: Chain, Monk: Leather.  If you want
to look to "what the original developers (Prior to the new group of
developers post Luclin) had a vision of," then mitigation among melee
classes would put monks at the bottom.

That would be the definition of a soft cap.  There's no hard cap on AC. The
"soft cap" is the point where added AC lends greatly deminishing results in
neutralizing the ATK value of mobs.  Through the different expansions, the
ATK of mobs has generally increased to the point in GoD now that tanks still
get significant returns on AC above 2000.

Show some parses from GoD zones that echo this statement.  I browsed the
monkly-business forums and saw several posts about obtaining accurate weapon
parses, but didn't see anything about AC.

Show some parses of an equivalently geared monk mitigating damage worse than
a nec, enc, wiz, mag, clr, dru, shaman.  While I have nothing save a
'feeling,' which is meaningless during discussions of dps or mitigation, I
find it difficult to believe that casters are mitigating better than a melee
class.

Exactly where would you like their mitigation to be? War, Pal/SK, Monk,
Ranger ?
