I've recently returned to EQ after almost a year's break (I quit soon after
Kunark was released, and found it hardly ran on my feeble PC) I now have an
upgraded PC, and am keen to try Velious, however I cant find anywhere that
sells the expansion other than Sony's Station itself, and the courier
charges from the States make that prohibitively expensive...
An old RL friend who recently quit EQ offered to give me his Velious
expansion as he is not expecting to ever play EQ again; my question is would
I be able to use it? My friend cant remember how the registration worked,
but he suspects that the expansion is tied solely to his EQ account, and
would not work with anyone else's account...
This sounds plausible to me - can anyone confirm or deny this?

Cheers,
Dolittle
