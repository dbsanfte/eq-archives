 It's still funny to watch people chase after a mob when they know
they'll get lots of adds. Then again Constructs summon so you don't have
much choice I suppose. For all other non-summoning mobs, just let them
run off. Since mobs stop when they get a certain distance away from you,
they'll be back eventually and usually with less adds. If you keep
chasing them they just keep running and you get more adds. (This is more
generic info and not specific to your DN journey)

 As for DN itself, it's not a bad place but it can be annoying to get to
if you just want to XP for awhile. This can be seen as a good thing as
it keeps the population down or a bad thing since if you have a total
wipeout you were probably the only ones in the area and there's nobody
to CR you. A single group can do fairly well at the zone in and you can
usually chain-trip Construct traps.

 Regardless, Dragon Necropolis beats Sirens Grotto. They really just
need to delete that zone and have the zone from CS drop you into WW.
Just watch out where you use illusions or you may get a Jaled Dar
DeathTouch(tm).
