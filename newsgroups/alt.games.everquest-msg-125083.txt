Heh.  The last big Ragefire dispute I've heard of was caused
by that.  A new guild (actually most/all of the 58+ from a
guild that splintered) was getting ready for their first
Ragefire.  Someone from the server's zerg guild zones in,
sees Ragefire on track, does a /who and doesn't see any
obvious killing force.  Checks for the bigger guilds, no one
in zone, calls for help.   After a few minutes, Ragefire is
dead, all without ever actually seeing the other guild.
(They pull to the BW zone;  the other guild was near his
spawn point; a third-party druid "wanted to see what he looked
like" and aggro'd him, then Gate'd.  The zerg guild pulled
him after the Gate so they didn't see the other guild at all.)

All the stupid "hey, we're raiding go /anon" did was make it
so they got ignored as a potential force.  I still don't
understand why guilds do that:  anyone in zone can see you,
/role or not, if you're in a guild most people would think
of checking.  And there's no way you're the only ones who
will know for long that a certain mob is up so going /role
gives you, at most, another few minutes.  And, at worst,
especially in zones where druids/wizards are known to hunt
(like, oh, Skyfire) you get ignored when someone does check
for an opposing force.
