There are several interesting factors at work here.  First, there is the
interesting fact that so far, every new MMORPG has expanded the market,
rather than taken customers away from the existing games.  In fact, each new
MMORPG has led to *growth* of the existing games.  This is not as strange as
it sounds: it is well known in adverstising circles that when a market is
not saturated, money spend by any one company to expand their market also
expands the markets of their competitors (the old "a rising tide raises all
boats" thing).

With SWG, WoW, Shadowbane, and EQ2 (and others I've surely forgotten) on the
horizon, and no sign that the MMORPG market is saturated, existing games,
like EQ, DAoC, AO, etc., can expect to grow over the next couple of years.
So, it is definitely in Verant's interest to keep working on EQ.

However, there is some uncertainty here, because of EQ2.  So far, all the
new MMORPGs have been *different* from the existing ones.  No doubt EQ2 will
grow the market for DAoC, AO, etc., but what about for EQ?  For someone
starting out new, will there be any reason to choose EQ over EQ2?  That is,
I can see someone who hasn't tried an MMORPG yet going to the store to check
out the EQ2 hype, and then picking up AO or DAoC instead (e.g., they decide
they like science fiction better than fantasy, or are intrigued by realm vs.
realm combat), but I can't see why someone would go to check out EQ2 and
then pick up EQ.  EQ2 *could* be the end of EQ growth.  If that happens,
that changes the purpose of EQ expansions.

Right now, EQ expansions have two purposes.  (1) They keep the game
interesting to existing players, so they are less likely to quit.  (2) They
generate generic interest in EQ, helping attract new players.  If EQ2 gets
rid of #2, the question is whether #1 is enough to justify new expansions,
especially when that talent could go to improving EQ2.

Finally, there is the age factor.  EQ is getting old.  What is the natural
life cycle of a game like this?  I remember when I started, in late 1999.
My current main character started in early 2000.  I remember hanging around
the newbie log in Nektulos, being in awe when a level 25 Shaman came and
buffed up the newbies, and being even more in awe once when I saw a level 49
Wizard port in.  Nowadays, something like half the population is level 50 or
above, and it seems half the people in newbie zones have high level friends
who are PLing them.  I think this gives the low level game for a true newbie
a very different feel than it had when I was a true newbie, and I think the
old way was better.  I wonder if as an MMORPG ages, it reaches a point where
it just isn't really all the interesting to many true newbies?  It seems to
me that each successive generation of player in a given game has just a
little bit less fun than the previous generation.
