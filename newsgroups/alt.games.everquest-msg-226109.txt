Same for dropped spells.  This is one of the main reasons I'm at least
temporarily (and maybe permenantly) retired.  It will take way too long
farming for cash to get the money for all the spells I want even as a lowly
61 Wizard.  I don't want to think about what it would take past that.

The thing that is most annoying is that some of the rare spells aren't all
that useful, such as the flaming sword.  It's mostly considered to be a
"fun" spell, but it costs more than I've ever had at once.
