Sort of. You cannot change your alignment after that but you're not exactly 
KoS in the other town. You can, for example, hunt in the other worlds easily 
enough but if you attempt to come to town you will be "banished" and sent on 
your way. The two respective towns do have ways that you can enter them from 
outside the city, avoiding the guards. The Down Below, for example, empties 
into the moat surrounding the walls of Qeynos, and I bet you could find the 
entrance there somehow and wind up inside Qeynos. If a guard spotted you 
you'd have to run to avoid banishment, but I don't think he'd kill you. 
Sounds like a very fun experiment to try sometime, I'll make it a project.
