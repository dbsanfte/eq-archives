Oh but what about the other shoe. Put back mana stones.
Get those Dwarf axes back to 18pp instead of 3pp. Get the DoTs back to
pre-nerf.

Sounds like making it harder on new players is OK.
But. not losing gear for a lousy 10 levels and getting to 10 in 5 hours
instead of 6 is terrible.
And my oh my it sure takes a GREAT deal of skill to stare at a book. LOTS of
learning happening there.

Perhaps they are just starting to rethink some silly old game play
mechanics.
The "Well it's always been done this way" whiners do make me grin.
Why should a melee yell for an hour in city late at note for a bind. Fun ?
Tactics ? skill ?
ergo soulbinders.

The changes don't decrease/increase tactics. Just remove some boring silly
game play mechanics.
I mean really. Just because you never have seen a zone you should be in risk
of losing all your banded ? And boy the skill it takes to run back to your
group and loot your corpse.

A new wave of non-twinked brand new sparkle in the eye players not wanting a
PL is a good thing.

I am even sure myself after playing for almost 3 years would jump to a new
game after my first free month. Way more options of games out there. No
reason at all to put up with silly brain dead game play mechanics. Back then
it was wondrous. I am glad I still enjoy the game.

Perhaps VI has seen lots of newbies play a few days never to return. Why not
keep them interested longer and get hooked ?
