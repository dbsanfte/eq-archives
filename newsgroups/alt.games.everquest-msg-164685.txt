Giggling manically and surrounded by armed hamsters, Dark Tyger

Remember, this is the sum total of his social contact. Humans are
social animals, and if he doesn't get it here, he won't get it
anywhere. Even the unaimous abuse he gets here is better than the..
nothing... he gets in real life.

He can no more stop being an ass than you or I could stop interacting
with people in real life. It *is* his real life.

He will never stop. But it *is* so fun watching every single poster
here make a fool out of him. Idiots on that level don't come by very
often. I'm just glad he gets so many replies so I see his idiocisms
even with him on global delete. :-)
