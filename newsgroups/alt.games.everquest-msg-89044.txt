Proceeded by your own inane ramblings, classic :)

Of course its aggrivating, but shit happens, deal with it.

I think if you look at it again, they handle the current way deliberatly,
and nothing to do with bad programming.   When you go LD, you have 30
seconds to exit the game... that means if you genuinaly go LD then you won't
just stick in the game for hours and hours,  but if you deliberaly go LD to
try and avoid death, well tough luck.

I stated a fact, if your getting hit by LD deaths so much, then get a damn
group to offer protection.  WTF is whining going to achieve?

Do you play on Prexus?  If not, then YOU have no idea how bad it is for some
people.  Prexus had a major crash recently, there have been several crashes
since then (Im talking down for several days continously).

Of course Im not happy about it, I just realise crying here doesn't achieve
anything, especially when there are very valid reasons for VI to handle LD's
how they do.

Lol is that so?  Well I'd say single pulling the queen in chardok beats quad
kiting HANDS DOWN for skill. I could say the same for every uber mob in the
game.

Fun for you maybe, that doesn't equal fun for anybody and everybody else.

Personally for me, AE groups beat quad kiting for fun and exp (25+ mobs in 1
pull in Sebilis)

> Its valid game play so dont even think about pissing on that.

You assume too much, want me to list my characters?  You will see a 59
wizard if I do, and guess what shirlock WIZARDS QUAD TOO

If your not being hit, you stay in the game 30 seconds when LD.. isn't that
what your asking for?
