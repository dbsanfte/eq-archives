Keeping in mind that I know you only have my side of this story, but
anyway...
I was in Crushbone last night on Bristlebane.
I am a 45th level druid and I was powerlevelling a 12th level Chanter and
13th level cleric.
Happily pulling from the throne room and tower.
A small group of people decided that I didn't need Emperor Crush and started
beating on him.
I said all in caps "BACK OFF YOU KILL STEALERS" or something to that
effect anyway. (no swearing involved, just agitated). Anyway they easily out
damaged our group of 2 and took loot and exp.
I then shouted across the zone that all Kill stealers WILL be reported, at
which point a lovely gent by the name of Matador shouted back "Shut up ****
you fucking tosser"
I immediately /reported matador and /petition matador.
The question is, as this is the only thing he said and it was in shout, will
it
actually send his words in the report? Or does that only work for tells?
A guide responded and said that he would talk to matador but that only a GM
could pull the report.
They moved into the throne room that we had cleared and declared the TR
Camped.
That group continued on their Kill Stealing ways until I logged off in
disgust.
