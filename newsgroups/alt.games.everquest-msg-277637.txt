IMO, it would be hard for them to implement this (at least in this way) in 
EQ for a number of reasons.

1.  The ecomonies of the servers are in an uproar with the server merges 
right now.

I know on CT, our economy was FUBAR to begin with.  From what I hear from 
the Brell folks, theirs was, too.  When the two FUBARed economies were 
combined ... well, it's playing hell with the prices.  For example, I wanted 
a pair of SCHWs for my 38SK, and they were available from 1.2K to 5.5K (I'd 
seen them as high as 7K before EQ2 was released).  Brokering items for cash 
would be very difficult in the current environment, because who would know 
what a fair price would be?

2.  They're combining servers as it is.  Why would they open a new one?

3. IGE, for better or worse, is dug in like a tick in EQ.  Not so much in 
EQ2.

That's just my opinion, of course.
