    VERY uncommon. Because of how awful the pathing is near the surface of
the water, the Netmaster will frequently despawn within seconds of spawning.
All that'll be left is his pet, which doesn't poof. If you fight him, keep
him rooted at all times - if he runs, there's a very high chance he'll
despawn.
