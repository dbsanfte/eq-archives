>but maybe 3 or 4 levels.  Am I out of line in feeling this?

No, the enchantress is a bitch.

Unfortunately, in EQ you really need a cleric and an enchanter once
you get to a certain level.  And Mama's-boy whiny psycho bitches most
often choose one of the two because they will get groups based on
their class no matter how bad their personality is.

So please DO spread their name around on your server, make their
grouping life as difficult as possible because of their actions.
Always be specific about what happened, and maintain the high-ground.

We have a few on my server, and they are not respected and well known
as loot-whores that noone trusts.  Several have ended up in their own
little guild 'cause noone else will have them for very long.
