You need to call Sony tech support and get back your old account under that
key. I had a similar problem, but I was installing it for the first time.
Apparently, someone had used the game and took it back to the store -- using
the key. Sony would not give me a new key over the phone, so I had to return
it to the store and try again. Best Buy was actually good about the
exchange -- it's technically against their return policy.
