How much difference would it actually make for the average twink / PLed alt 
?

How many people who could not make a twink / PL alt could do this (pay 10k 
for level 25) ?

Assuming that the number of e-bayers reamain constant (an thus irelivent)

I seriously doubt that this would make anything much worse.
I still don't think it is a good idea, but that is neither here or there.
