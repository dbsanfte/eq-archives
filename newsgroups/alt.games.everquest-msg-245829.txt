Your adventure stone can be augmented onto your charm by using a bath in 
a Wayfarer's camp. Click the bath. Put stone and charm in the bath, and 
click combine. Ta-da.

Go on an adventure. Read the text given to you at the start of the 
quest. Do what that text tells you within the time allotted, and you 
have had Victory. Do it within 30 minutes of the timer, and you will get 
a consolation prize. AFter that, the zone no longer exists and you and 
your corpses will be ported out.
