I have two machines at home, both running EPoX 8KHA+ motherboards (VIA
KT266A chipset) with Athlon-C 1GHz procs, and I don't have any issues
whatsoever running EQ.  This is the same chipset that I run on all 25 of my
3D-modeling workstations at work, and we have no hardware stability issues.
If you can swap the motherboards out, the EPoX boards perform wonderfully
and run under $100 these days.

The problem here is not the VIA chipset, it's that you're running the AMD
761, which is a Frankenstein setup with the AMD northbridge and VIA
southbridge.  You should either get the AMD 760 (older, and I can't truly
recommend it for the money), which is all-AMD, or one of the VIA KT-series
boards that is all-VIA.  It's the mix that introduces problems here.

For reviews, you may want to check out www.anandtech.com.  They've been
around for a while, and don't seem hugely biased towards Intel or AMD (or
nVidia or ATi for that matter).

Good Luck,

Me.
