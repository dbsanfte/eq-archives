Since I don't agree with you, I can not give you any examples of advantages
naming a character against the policy gives players. Maybe you can suggest a
few.

The above seems logical, but it isn't because, well, the animal we're
talking about isn't always logical. I smoke. Does it give me an immediate
advantage? No. The days of headrushes are long gone :) Does it give me a
gradual advantage? Depends on how you feel about cancer, I guess. Does it
stop me? No. Why? Addiction. Can addictions be overcome? Usually if they
don't kill you first. Why dont I stop smoking then? (Rhetorical question.
:) )

*shrug* I could ignore socks. A headress, however....
