Specifically at the entrance to the paineel newbie area there is an NPC that
casts fear on you and you totally lose control.  If you run far enough,
he'll leave you alone but usually he keeps coming after you and you gotta
zone quick to survive.

The warrens is good for getting used to dungeons.  Personally, I still hate
dungeons.  If you wanna solo after I'd say 18 or so, run thru the warrens at
breakneck speed not stopping to fight even if you get jumped is the best way
to get past. Then fight in Stonebrunt.  Wide open spaces.  Kobolds to kill
near the entrance so you can zone if you get in trouble.  There's even a
town that you can sell at, didn't find a bank there tho, would have liked a
bank.  The kobold shaman drops a weight reduction pack that I still use.  If
you just wanna explore Stonebrunt make sure you have camo or Inviz
especially the first time, there are nasty gorillas that don't like anyone
and other high level mobs in the zone.  Good luck
