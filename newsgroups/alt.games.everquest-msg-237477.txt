Ok, about a week or so ago I posted a message about lockups I was experiencing.
They were happening on the EULA screen, server log-on screen, server select screen, character select
screen and on exit the server select screen again. My mouse pointer would be at the upper left hand
corner and wouldn't move, couldn't alt-enter to window the program and then shut down wioth
ctrl-alt-del. I would have to hit the reset button on the case. I contacted SOE and got the
automated response to shut down my firewall (yeah right and let some script kiddie access my
system). I turned off the one that comes with Windows XP pro and left zonealarm alone. I even tried
to run EQ in windows 98 mode (big mistake, long zone times, stuttering mp3s and lag spikes out one's
woopies-dasiy). And I'm still haveing the lock up problem. 
Short of reinstalling Eq, what else can I try?
