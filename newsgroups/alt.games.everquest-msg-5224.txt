I'd say definitly Lake of Ill Omen. The zone is perfect from the early
20's to up to 30 if you care to stay that much in the same zone. After
you hit 30, you can just go one zone away and hunt in Frontier
Mountain for a while, and then hit The Overthere, again just one zone
away. And if you *really* love Kunark, Dreadlands is said to be nice
in the early 40's. 
Of course, in your mid 30's you may want to check out Velious (or
Cazic Thule, but I read here that since Velious came out, Cazic is
empty...)
