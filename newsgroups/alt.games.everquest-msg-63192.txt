Precisely the reason I've decided not to give my necro twink a surname,
even though I'm already past 20. Just in case I run into Lokari and need
her to give me a port or something.

Seriously, I had the originally (drunken) idea that to be the ultimate
in life-hating, evil, death to every-living-thing type necro, I would
name my character, "Uxivar Fluffybunny".  I've since decided to go with
one name only, at least for now.
