Although I've never played a FD class (well, I did play a monk but didn't get
him up to FD level) I believe that even a successful FD will fail to shake a
caster who's already begun but not yet finished a spell.  He won't stop
casting (apparantly NPC's don't know how to duck) and when the spell lands on
your apparantly dead body he'll realize its not dead after all.

One of the little quirks that makes a FD class "interesting" (in the Chinese
Curse sense of "may you live in interesting times") to play.
