This is based on hearsay, but the quest might be broken.  Here is a
suggestion I've heard given many times, which has worked for most (no
first-hand experience though).  Delete the quest. Yes, I know, but the
gnoll bits and pieces won't be hard to get again.  Do NOT examine the
droppable items until you have gotten the spirit, heart, and brain
"triggers".  folks who did this said they've gotten the spirit relatively
quickly after restarting the quest. Evidently there is some kind of bug
where, if a person has everything BUT the spirit, the spirit isn't being
found.  Personally I got the spirit, brain, and heart all on my 10th
gnolls or so (all at once).

Same goes for the orc mastery.
