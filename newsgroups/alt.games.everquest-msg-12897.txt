I play an Erudite Enchanter so when I needed to venture into Neriak, Ogguk
or Grobb I changed form so that I am not KoS. In disguise so they cannot see
my true form so don't kill me.

I have been soloing Watchman Halv and Mylz in Steamfont so am now KoS to the
Gnomes.

No Problem I hear you say, why not change form with Illusion Gnome, they
won't recognise you so your faction will reset to Apprehensive?

Nope doesn't work :o(

So to any Enchanters out there thinking of doing your Epic at some point,
Kill Halv by all means but be prepared to kill a few hundred Minotaurs

Be safe
