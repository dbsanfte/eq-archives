Login screen says it's up, but I keep getting Error 1017: Can't login in 
to server, may need to re-run update patch, etc. I've exited out and 
re-ran so there were no updates to be a concern. I can log in to other 
servers just fine. Is this something that's a problem on my end to 
correct or do I just have to wait it out? Rodcet Nife is still in its 
usual place on the sort-by-population list so it would seem that other 
people are logged in now.

Thanks for any assistance. :)

PS: If I can also sneak in one other quick question I have while writing 
this, I'm a shadow knight currently working on training up all my weapon 
skills at lvl 18. This was my first character created on Everquest so I 
didn't know I was supposed to be keeping them up before. So I'm saving 
up plat for good DEX armor since that's what every web site I've 
searched says raises weapons skills, but people in game swear it's 
really INT I need instead. So is it DEX I need, or INT, or both?
