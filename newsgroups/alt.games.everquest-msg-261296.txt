Yes but this is the complaint about epics; the current ones aren't all 
that epic.  Which isn't too surprising, they are at best the top end 
content from 7 expansions ago.

Fact is, the suprising part is that a few of the epics hold up at all 
compared to new content.

My contention regarding the Bow Epic was that this would have been, in 
the long run, superior to any melee slot weapon precisely because it 
didn't eat a primary/secondary slot.  If you could carry your cleric 
epic around in a slot that otherwise wasn't being used for anything 
fantastic, perhaps it wouldnt' spend so much time in your bag.
