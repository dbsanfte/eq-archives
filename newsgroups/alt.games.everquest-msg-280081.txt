No, the different game is WoW - which has the same "terrible
concept" as EQ2...

How's that?  EQ2 was marketed as different than EQ.  It's just
set in the same overall theme, Norrath.

Every fantasy MMORPG is compared to EQ.  Again, if they'd just
recreated EQ - with the same flaws that make it EQ - they'd have
kept their userbase - and not gained very much.

Actually what I considered flaws in EQ are NOT present in EQ2 due
to mechanics changes.

They DID have to do something.   The server consolidations speak for
themselves IMO.

Sure, but I doubt Sony could have done anything about that.   IMO
an upgraded EQ - with all the same flaws - would have been an even
bigger disaster.

Vanguard *might* be EQ w/o being EQ - but WoW certainly isn't.
