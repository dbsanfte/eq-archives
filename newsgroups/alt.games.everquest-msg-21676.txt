To a point yes, but given that I just healed the wizzie, the druid,
complete healed the main tank and secondary tank, and now that i have
a second to heal the puller he's run off thinking I"ve got it under

others are absolutely correct, if i'm fm, everyone is healthy, there
is absolutely no reason I shouldnt be stunning or nuking.
