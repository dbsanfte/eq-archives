Many reasons to kill the guards:
1) Faction
2) XP
3) because they can -its a challenge
4) decent loot
5) quest items
Verant set up some guards to be killed, btw the guards in Nek Forest are
good XP for "good" classes. Some people actually take the place of the
guards and will help the newbies that get into trouble. They are under no
obligation to do so but some still will. On the other hand cussing at
someone can get you into loads of trouble, even if not banned it puts a flag
on your account which is never a good thing. When dealing with others I tend
to be so nice its condescending but at least it doesn't mark me.
