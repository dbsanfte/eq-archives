Hehe, yea seems like that fat reducing drug is one of them, but if you
looked at the data from the trials it warned physicians that it could happen
( there was criteria that would make a person more suseptible to fatality)
but the patients just kept demanding the product. Finally due to not
following the guidelines the drug was pulled. If you look up any drug in a
PDR (physicains desk reference) it gives the stats on the percentage of
people having reactions to a the medications. In case you think they might
be skewed due to patients knowledge that they were taking the medication,
thats not the case. Most studies are done as a double blind. The doctor
doesn't even know if the patient is taking the drug or not. The only one
with the knowledge is the pharmacist, at least until the results are
revealed.
