You don't lose any experience from death in WoW at all.  You take a hit
to your item's durability, and a larger one if you choose to rez at the
spirit healer.  In EQ2, besides the debuff, you also have the
experience debt.

I understand why some people like the challenge of death penalties.
But I'm not one of them.  I think this is probably because I cut my
teeth on single player RPGs, where if you died, you just reloaded the
game.  In some games, you don't have to reload, but it's not really fun
to recover from deaths, so why bother if you don't have to?  I'm
perfectly happy with WoW's death system...it gets you back in the game
and playing as soon as possible, which is the whole point--less
downtime, more fun.

Heroic Opportunities definitely add an element of chance to fights in
EQ2, but when solo they only ever made a difference if I was fighting
mobs over my level or group ones anyway.  It's the same as fighting a
yellow con in EQ1, or an orange con/Elite mob in WoW--in order to
survive, you have to do a little bit more than your usual battle plan.
I know, as a hunter, there have been several fights that I only
survived by suddenly remembering "Oh yeah, I have Scare Beast!" and
fearing the add away.  I did a quest last week where I had to kill the
captains of three pirate ships in Stranglethorn Vale...and these ships
were extremely tightly packed with nukers and rogues, so many that I
rarely had a fight against less than two mobs, and once had to fight 5
in a row because of bad luck with wanderes and runners I wasn't able to
handle.  I had to use spells I almost never used, like seeing through
the eyes of my pet to look around corners, and I experimented with
different pulling and aggro techniques.  It was a blast that night, it
was the biggest challenge I had ever overcome solo in any MMORPG.  I
died only once (my pet died about 10 times, hooray for Feign Death),
and it was so nice to be able to come back, revive, and continue
killing just ahead of repops.  I didn't feel frustrated from dying at
all...I just had fun.

Game on,

The Oneiromancer
