Well, first you gotta have 10 friends.  Then you have to get them all in
a chat room together.  Oh, did I mention you need 10 friends?  You need
a GM to approve the charter.  Ah yes, there is that 10 friend bit
again.  Then you need to get them all together in game and get another
GM to tag you all.

Alternatively you could go around shouting for people to join your
guild.  It must work pretty well because many people do it.
