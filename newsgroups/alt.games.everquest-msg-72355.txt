Well actually yes, my motherboards tells me the cpu temperature as do many
others.
My intel one runs about 15 degrees cooler than my amd one which seems
to get quite hot. Both are similarly cooled.

Yeah I re-considered my posting after sending it and cancelled it, but that
doesn't seem to work very often on usenet these days. Although I certainly
prefer intel chips myself, the thing I wrote wasn;t exactly fair.

I'm sure that Athlons are fine, if people want to buy them they are fine
with
me. I still find that my P3 runs things faster than my athlon even though
all
of the benchmarks say it shouldn't., but that could easily be anything else
like
a better motherboard or graphics card.

For everquest, lots of memory and a decent video card seem to make *much*
more difference than your CPU anyway.
