HP?  HP determine how deep you can cannibalize before healing.
So, just as with a Necro, HP are an extension of your mana pool
and to some degree constrain your mana flow for a Shaman.

AC?  Mobs tend to react badly to slows, even worse to resisted
slows.  Shaman _will_ get smacked around and AC helps minimize
the pain involved.  AC also helps you channel that crucial root
or slow through the beating (not only by decreasing the chance
you'll be hit, smaller hits seem to interrupt less often).

Hell, my Druid gets noticeable mileage out of AC and HP, and he's
far from being a tank in anybody's eyes, even his own.
