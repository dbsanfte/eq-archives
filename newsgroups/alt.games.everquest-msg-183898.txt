A long time ago you could change a mobs delay by handing it a weapon.
This was changed - now delay is unaffected, and damage is only affected
if 2 x weapon damage is greater than the pets natural damage.

Up until level 12, it's useful to give a pet a rusty 2 hander, available
at Hallard's resales in E. Freeport for a couple of gold each.  After
that a pet's natural damage is better.
