Let me start of by saying GRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! 

Now then, yes I read the pathetic cry for attention back in the day, as
well as the tripe that followed her rightful banishment, what the heck
do you think I am still pissed off about so many months later?  I take
it you are one of the unwashed who were so easily impressed by her
desire for attention.  Perhaps rather than asking those with their eyes
open to close them you might consider opening your own.  Tweety was a
self serving incompetent unable to fathom exactly what being a Guide was
all about.  When faced with the reality that it was a thankless job more
often than not performed for folks who rather than showing gratitude or
appreciation would just as soon insult you she made the choice to
violate the trust of the position in order to make herself feel better. 
By her acts she lowered all Guides to her level in the eyes of many
players, simply power hungry assholes who had no respect for players. 
Perhaps it is you who should think carefully if you know enough about
the subject before questioning my opinions on it, I have a feeling you
lack the understanding I have in this case and I assure you that you do
not want it.
