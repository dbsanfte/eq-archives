It works great, its nice to be using all of my system ram again
instead of using half of it while having a huge virtual swap use in
the two SOE windowed versions. EQW just works a ton better. 

EQW won't let you adjust the gamma anymore with the in game slider,
while the dx9 change makes it dark. I solved this with my nvidia
desktop properties by having it put that configuration shortcut in the
taskbar, while then saving 1.47 gamma (in the settings on the desktop,
under advanced geforce etc) as "eqw". Then I saved another setting as
"normal." So now I start up eqw and simply click on that to change i
tto the EQW setting, then back when I'm done. No big deal really.
