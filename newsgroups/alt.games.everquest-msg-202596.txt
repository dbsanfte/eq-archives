Ok, here goes the question:  Are flags still there?  as in the old
process of getting flags?   i.e.  the Trials in PoJ, do you still
receive flags for finishing this task?  If so, this would be a nice
double way to get exp...  Exp from killing the beasts, and exp for
turning in your flags to the new NPC...
And also if thats the case...  Get several flags before you go to the
NPC.
I have heard that individuals on test who Have all the flags and are
level 65, receive 7 AA points when they do the NPC flag turnin.  Now
thats sweet.
I heard having 3 flags = ~54% of lvl 64  as well....  guess we will
see.
