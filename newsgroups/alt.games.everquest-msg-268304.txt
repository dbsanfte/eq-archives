Is that a serious question?

Expansions hardly change the entire dynamics of the game.  They add some
more of the same..  you still have a char you know, mastered over years,
skills and abilities gained and worked on over the years.. the gear and
money you work for.

Or you start level 1. No knowledge of the game, a new interface, new people,
new communities, new spells to learn, entirely brand new world, things that
may carry the same name across games but mean something completly different.
No clue of mobs, of in-depth game info, etc.

But yeah, aside from those and more points.. its not really much different
starting a new game or buying OoW, is it.....
