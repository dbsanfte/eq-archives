I believe it's everything prior to SoL. There is no Luclin. That means no 
Vah Shir, Bazaar or port books if I'm not mistaken.

The interesting thing is that aside from the basic composition of the 
various classes (there are no berserkers), it is almost a completely 
different game. The zones are mostly named different and often populated 
with vastly different mobs. Also, the zone connections aren't even the same 
in many cases.

They've don't a great job in making it their own.

One other interesting point - only two or three clerics may be casting CH 
on any player at the same time. There are many other such differences 
regarding various spells and abilities as well.
