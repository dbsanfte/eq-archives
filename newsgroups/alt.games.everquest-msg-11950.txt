Hey Jakugg ,
    As you probably realize I have spent the last several levels in the
Crystal Caverns and let me just tell you the exp just flies by and the loot
is good to. I dinged 36 last night and 35 went by much faster than 30 or 31
did. It's hard to spend a couple of good hours fighting without making at
least 50pp. I have made a couple of hundred in an evening fighting there.
Come team up with me sometime.
