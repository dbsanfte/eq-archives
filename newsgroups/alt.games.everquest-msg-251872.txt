First off, don't trust casterrealms. It's info is occasionally wrong,
sometimes outdated and often omitting things.

For pure spelldescriptions use lucy
(http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spelllist.html?classes=MAG&source=Live).
If you want a few nice overviews use the library pages of the
magician's tower
(http://forum.magecompendium.com/viewtopic.php?t=3172) or
magecompendium
(http://www.magecompendium.com/library/spell-list-library.html) (made
by the same writer, both are updated equally).

The lvl 61 DS is also upgraded with the last patch (check lucy for
that) to now have 48 damage per hit and last twice as long.

Back off is a mem blur yes. Wipes it's hatelist clean.
The hotkey doesn't work all that well when 2 or more mobs are hitting
your pet though. It's hatelist is determined quite a lot by the hits
it takes from mobs. If a mob gets a lucky few in the pet will switch
to it most of the time. Especially if the mobs are seperated enough to
have one at the side of the pet the side hitting mob will do a bit
more damage every time and your pet will switch almost every combat
round.

I have not found a workable solution to this problem and I doubt there
will be any good ones till SOE decides to install a /pet sticktotarget
command or somesuch.

Not sure if this is so. I generally tend to avoid situations where
there is more then 1 mob on my pet so I do not have all that much
experience with exactly when the pet switches to a lower-hp mob.

Though these are fair comparisons it generally is best just to test
it. Nuking or healing is mostly determined by the dps the mobs are
putting out and the hp they have. At one point you just need to start
healing your pet otherwise it will die and then you will die.

But as the other person suggested, nuking often has the advantage.
Mages normally have a damage focus and are specialized in evocation or
conjuration so nuking has a substantial mana benefit over healing
(healing foci are hard to come by for a mage).


As an alternative route, you might want to look into chain-petting the
mobs down. It's one of the most efficient killing methods we have, but
it takes the longest (unbuffed / geared pets most of the time). But if
you are having trouble getting a double-spawn down it might work.

Try doing LDoN adventures with 2 tanks. Raining is fun :P.

I wouldn't advice raining when you are pet-tanking 2 mobs though. Rain
aggro is often less then straight-nuke aggro, but more often then not
still enough to peel one of the 2 mobs off your pet.

Hehe doesn't work. We don't have snare.
Besides if you want to kite, go for singles and let your 62 water
backstab. Goes a lot faster.

Planar Renewal is about the second best BST get (best bst heal is over
2k) and BST don't have such a long refresh on their heals.
PR is a nice upgrade over the previous petheals, but IMO still
inadequate to effectively solo with it.

Pet heals are being looked into though, a developer already stated
that.
