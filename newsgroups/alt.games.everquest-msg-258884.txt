The only quest for an instrument I'm aware of is the Nostrolo Tambourine.
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=427
I'm not sure whether you can do that at lvl30something. And it definitly
is easier to camp the money needed for a trueborn drum of the dark rites!
But if you want to do the quest just to do quest stuff then go on and
have fun. :)
Btw, for other instruments I have some recommendations though none is
for a quest. For wind I'd try to get the bloodied flute. It costs mere
10 points in MM LDoN and is primary slot only.
For brass I would go for a troubadours mace. Unless you want to AE kite.
Then you should look for a high brass mod.
For stringed instruments I have no real outstanding recommendation. ;)
The combined instruments from Katta Kastellum are quite nice though.
