At level 9 in GFay or Butcher Block, you did not see Brownies...  Are you
thinking of Pixies or perhaps Faeries?  At level 9, should you actually see
a Brownie, there would be two hits...  The Brownie hitting you and you
hitting the ground "LOADING PLEASE WAIT"....

hehe...  Brownies hang in LFay and you definitely should not go there...
Not yet.

As a fellow Ranger, I am thrilled that you are having fun though!!!  I love
my Ranger and can't imagine playing anything else atm...  However, we just
got the new computers up and running and connected...  Now we have to load
EQ all over again from scratch.  We're doing it this way to be able to start
fresh and hopefully bypass any problems.

Good luck to you and Happy Hunting!
