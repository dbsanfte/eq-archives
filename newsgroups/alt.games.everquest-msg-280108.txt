Agreed, but they are reasons why people will quit any game.  It won't take
you long to find someone posting somewhere that they are quitting WoW
because of all the "b.Net kiddies".

Of course you can compare game populations with world populations and make
anything insignificant.  I think we both realize that is pointless.  Though
I'm not sure you will realize how apt the analogy is.

So if 10% of your userbase doesn't like the limitation, is it a "big
problem"?  20%?  50%?  75%?  2%?  Hell, I might agree with you that Sony
should ignore minorities in games, as it definitely follows my logic in
another recent thread...

Why won't the level 50 get the drop?  Is he being punished for having
accomplished something?

See above about immersion killing solutions to social issues.  =P

Levels are no more and no less critical in EQ2 as in EQ.  They are both
level based games and make no attempt to hide it.

Impossible since you snipped out pertinent parts.  Snipping the rest of it
as meaningless to the original thread.

I rather find the fact that they anyone would think they *could* leverage
off the success to such a degree (i.e., creating a sequel) without killing
off the original completely was possible.  As has become obvious by EQ's
continued dominance of EQ2's population, it wasn't possible, at least not by
Sony.
