In ancient Ireland, the Craobh Ruadh, or "Red Branch" (sometimes called the 
Craobh Righ, "King's Branch") was a fiercesome band of warriors absolutely 
dedicated to each other and sworn to the service of the King of Ulster. But, 
this isn't ancient Ireland; this is EQ ...

Ruadh Righ is a new guild on the Solusek Ro server founded by myself and 
several long-time friends. We are looking for players who are mature, have a 
sense of humor, play the game for fun, and who play honestly. Our goal is to 
experience everything EQ has to offer, but at our own pace and in our own 
time.  If you haven't found quite the right guild, and just want some nice 
folks to hang out with, or share grouping opportunities, raids and 
adventures with, feel free to contact us. All levels and classes are 
welcome.

Although we are a small group for the moment, we will grow. But that growth 
will be based on admitting people who are fun to be around. Ruadh Righ is 
for folks whose main priority is the quality of the time they spend online 
and in-game.

Our permanent webpage is currently under construction, so if you are 
interested in finding out more about Ruadh Righ, please send me an e-mail at 
jgibson1066@hotmail.com.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,

Doriath
Deputy Guild Leader
Ruadh Righ
