The Tutorial charm is something like Str Sta Int Wis +5, HP and mana +10

The augment starts out at either nothing or 1s in most stats, and then 
gets one point better every 10 LDoN runs you do in a single dungeon, 
more or less.  So for most people you'd have to do something on the 
order of 50 LDoN runs (spread out in increments of 10 per dungeon type) 
in order to get the same general effect as the tutorial charm, not 
counting whatever charm you buy to put the augment on... but the charms 
you're likely to get for that are something like 1 point to one stat, 
works only in an LDoN.

Basically, the tutorial charm is outlandishly good for a level 1 item, 
in fact after doing all my BER newbie quests and all the quests in the 
tutorial it was still probably my best item, and thats not counting the 
fact that it goes in the charm slot, which is woefully undersupported in 
the game, making it far more valuable than say an earring with the same 
stats.
