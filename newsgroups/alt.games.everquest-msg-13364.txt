And yet, in your other response, you still fail to offer any reasoning.
In another very similar thread here in the last few days, Biz, you kept
telling another poster ad nauseum [sic] "and yet you keep saying the
same thing, but refuse to answer the question put to you. This means
that you either don't have an answer or are incredibly full of shit."
  All I have asked here is for a discussion of *WHY* (please read the
preceding word which was emphasized. It's really critical here.) it's an
"exploit" in the eyes of Verant. I'm already well aware that it has been
_deemed_ and exploit, and I shall not do it, since I wish to continue
playing. I'm more interested in *how* it's viewed as an exploit? The mob
was still able to come and hit me, albeit in a delayed fasion, and he
killed me several times. In the other "key" examples you cited, (kiting,
et. al) that would seem to get me off the hook on the "playing it safe"
thing.
  Any comment? Beuller? Anyone?
