Actually, it doesn't even include Kunark.  Though, the zones available is
really beside the point.  The point is full interaction within the servers
with the mass population.

So, in short once again, all honesty, the best way to "experience" the
"feel" of EQ is to just buy the box set for $10.00 vice the magazine.  The
"demo" server is a non PvP server, which may or may not be to the liking of
the prospective customer (errm, demo tester), therefore; another reason why
I would suggest the box set over the magazine release. <shrug>

Though, it's not my money, so honestly to anyone thinking of which to do...
do whatever you wish.  Personally, I'm going to read my magazine for the
10th time to ensure I have gotten all its worth out. <grin>
