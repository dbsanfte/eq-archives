Because people don't wish to roleplay.  And unless they are on a roleplaying 
server, they should not have to.  'As they should' is from a rather narrow 
point of view, as people play in the mode that gives them the most 
enjoyment.  Though it is called a role playing game, there is no 
requirement to play a role.

Because the person playing the Wood Elf is there to have fun.

Again, because people are there to have fun.  For some, this means playing 
the role.  For other's, it means social interaction.  For those who role 
play, they would do it, as the rat said, because it is in the nature of the 
good cleric to be altruistic.  For those who do not role play, they do it 
because of common courtesy in recognizing that there is another person on 
the other side of theat Evil Necro character who is there to have fun, too.

Again, because it is a game where people have come to enjoy themselves.  If 
they have a common goal, they will group to accomplish that goal.

Agreed.  But your points really only hold true validity on a roleplay 
'required' server.  Of which there are none.  There are servers in EQ Live 
with roleplay rules, but no requirements.  There are servers in EQ2 with 
roleplay preferred, but again, no requirements.

Again, for some people this is how they obtain the most enjoyment.  Not for 
me, of course.  I prefer to explore.

Ease of communication.  Everyone knows common and if the Elf wishes to 
interract with the Barbarian, either the elf must learn Halasian, or they 
both may speak common.  Again, your point really only holds merit where 
roleplay is required.

The counter to most of what you have written can be summed up pretty much as 
follows.  The fact is, many people enjoy role playing games, but find 'role 
playing' itself to be quite tiresome and a burden.  People are there to 
enjoy themselves, and therefore take the route that they feel will give them 
the most enjoyment.  As to raising complaints about some point in the game 
that they feel detracts from that enjoyment, that is human nature.  If 
someone otherwise enjoys the game, but finds fault on a point here or there, 
they are going to raise complaints about those points.  Again, human nature. 
You see it in politics.  You see it in business dealings.  You even see it 
shopping at the mall.  There really is no difference here.  It's simply 
someone lobbying for their point of view and preference.

No.  We choose to enjoy our time online to the best of our ability.  As 
stated above, many find the roleplaying mechanics that you are stating 
everyone should use to be a detriment to said enjoyment.  Some find it a 
requirement for their enjoyment.  Both groups will simply have to agree to 
disagree on that point because you're never going to convince everyone to 
see eye to eye here.

If you're not already doing so, play on one of the roleplaying servers.  But 
again, recognize that none of these servers require roleplaying and there 
are many on these servers who do not wish to do so.  There really is little 
point in stating such an "if", however.  It's never going to happen.  Plain 
as that.

This is an example that many would consider griefing.  If everyone involved 
were there to roleplay, then no harm done.  But again, as I have said 
before, you will never have everyone in the game who is there to roleplay. 
In fact, something very similar to this happened in EQ2 about a month or two 
ago.  It's been a while since I read the post on the forums, but it was 
something along these lines:

One of the 'good' races was hunting in the Commonlands, whether just there 
to hunt or on the road to betrayal I don't quite recall, and requested a 
group on the OOC channel.  Several people made similar comments as above, 
the player was able to recognize the fun in which they were intended and 
shrugged the comments off, but some would not have been as forgiving and 
would have instantly issued a /report on all involved.  Keep in mind that 
many people have very thin skins.

But continuing from this example, said player finally managed to get a group 
together with one or more of the 'evil' races.  The group got into a tough 
area where a shard retrieval solo was more or less out of the question, 
'good' player got killed.  As player resurrects at the closest camp, sees a 
comment on group channel about that's what you get for hunting where you 
don't belong, and group disbands.  Player is stuck in hostile territory, and 
very upset.  His or her fun was ruined.

On the part of the 'evil' character, they may indeed have simply been 
roleplaying in the mode that you requested above.  In the victim's eyes, and 
SOE's, that equated to griefing.

There can sometimes be a very fine line between having fun with roleplay in 
such ways, and taking it too far.  And, unfortunately, you don't always know 
which is which for the other person involved.  For all we know, the 'evil' 
player above may have even thought the 'good' player would enjoy the joke 
since they'd shrugged off the /ooc chat taunts.  Such was not the case.

Some would argue that if there was any single way the game was 'meant' to be 
played, there would not be constant balancing and rebalancing by the 
developers.

Worthy idea.  And some do just this in EQ Live.  Not possible in EQ2 of 
course, as there is no PvP or dueling.  But there are indeed those who 
roleplay as such.  But, once again, you're never going to get everyone to 
agree to such a play style.

Um.  Wrong.  Sony owns the games through and through.  Remember the phrase 
"You're in our world now"?  You pay to play it.  They allow you to play it. 
But at the end of the day, it's their product.  Their game.  Their rules.

No flaming intended.  Just counterpoints from another view on the issue.
