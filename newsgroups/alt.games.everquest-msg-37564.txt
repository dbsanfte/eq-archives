(please excuse  Tin Cup reference, for those who've seen it.)
   I've come to the realzation that I haven't picked up my 2HS weapon
(currently a BABS) in several levels.  Why? Because I'm always
struggling so hard to keep aggro on myself, and off the cleric, wiz,
rogue, etc. In fact the only time I've used it in at least the last
month was attacking Vox, where I really wasn't worried about taunting.
(/em grimaces at the reccolection.)
  After finally getting copeland's weapons analyzer to work and add in
all my weapons, (thanks for all the help, by the way) I see that, in
reality, I could allegedly be doing slightly more damage with my "Big
Dog" than with any combination of my 1HS weapons. But whenever I use it,
I seem to lose aggro all the time. Particularly with a rogue
backstabbing the mob for ungodly damage. So I stick with the fastest
hitting, best proccing stuff I have and taunt like mad.
  So... a question for all you older warriors out there. When/where do
you break out the big dog? And how do you keep up taunt when using it?
