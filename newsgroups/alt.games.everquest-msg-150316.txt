| ....I've been thinking about buying Everquest.  Though I know graphics on
it
| are somewhat "aged" people STILL to this day rave about how fun it is.  A
| game that has been out for 2 years and STILL has millions of people raving
| kind of has me sold.  I can honestly say that I was REALLY into DAoC,
| Dungeon Siege, and Diablo II for a while but I never have even played
| Everquest.  I think now is the time because my computer isn't exactly a
| speed demon (Athlon 850MHz, 256MB PC133, GeForce2 64MB) and I kind of want
a
| game with great gameplay to tide me over until I build my new computer in
| January.  By then I'll be ready for games like SWG, EQ2, and AC2.  Thanks!

Go for it Kyle, you only live once!  That system by the way, should do just
fine with EQ Trilogy.  Save the Luclin expansion for the new PC ;)
