Aye, thats something to shoot for.  But at 760 points, its not something 
that you are going to get points for at 3 per mission.  In fact at 15 
per mission I'd still have to do nothing but Takish missions, 50 times 
in a row.  I'm getting about 2 yellow of AA per mission, thats 20AA 
earned sitting there working on this one augment... and its only 
sensible to spend 6 of those AA, so I'd stop improving even the tiny bit 
that single added points of HP regen do long before seeing this at 52.

Assuming I average 1 yellow of "real" exp per mission, 50 missions would 
still be ten levels; I'd be level 62 before getting the focus even if I 
did nothing but that single type of LDoN mission.

Of course this isn't accurate, as at higher levels you get less and less 
bar movement per mission, and you get more points per mission.  And I 
could have done nothing but Tak missions from the beginning, which would 
put me halfway there instead of just 80 points towards it.  Possibly 
this means that I could be looking at buying the thing by the time I hit 
58 or so, IF I drop every other endeavor.

14 missions at level 65, where you get 51 points per, even that seems 
outrageous for a single augment... but my point was that at lower 
levels, the toil for any meaningful reward is far out of line with what 
I'd expect to see.

I can't say about 65 Takish missions, but at 52 there's certainly no 
requirement for an enchanter.  Did one the other day with warrior, 
cleric, and mage... just the three of us, no deaths, success with 15 
minutes to spare.  Not a twinked out warrior either, he has an 8kpp main 
weapon which procs a 75dd stun (planar something or other) and has 
decent stats but certainly nothing close to a 1:1 ratio.  No mezzer, no 
slower, no twinks, just a simple tank, chealer/luller, and pet/DS/nuker
