I'm just wondering if there is a guide on the web somewhere that would
tell what one's faction starts out with for different cities/zones
depending on a character's race/class/religion?  (this is without
doing any kind of faction work)

For example, "An agnostic human monk will start out KOS in all of
cities A and B, will be dubious to guards and such and such guilds at
city C but KOS to the necro and SK guilds of city C, will be
indifferent in cities D, E, F, G, will be apprehensive in the
Overthere, will be indifferent in Firiona Vie", etc.

Or "A gnome necromancer will start out dubious to guards and such and
such guilds at city A but KOS to cleric and paladin guild of city A,
will be KOS to all of city B, will be apprehensive to all of city C,
will be dubious to guards and such and such guilds, KOS to such and
such guilds but amiable to necromancer guild in city D, will be
apprehensive in the Overthere, will be KOS in Firiona Vie", etc.

(Of course, the only faction I know for sure is that all non-Iksars
start out KOS to all guards and guilds in Cabilis regardless of
religion--doh!)

Thanks in advance,
