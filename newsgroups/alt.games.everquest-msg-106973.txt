"Stay here, do not move" raids are not much fun for the people who have to
stay put not moving.  I hate big zones full of interesting places like Hate
or the Hole, where all I get to see on raids is the zone in, and three or
four camp spots, and the backs of the raid leaders when we are told to
follow them on a run from one camp spot to the next.

Now that Eye of Zomm is safe, I'm a bit happier, since I can do some
exploring while at the "do not move" spot.
