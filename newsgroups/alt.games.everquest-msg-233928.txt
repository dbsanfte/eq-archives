I have heard that it's possible to loose exp if you split it between
the two but that might well be an EQ urban myth (there's a lot of
those out there <g>). The reason has to with the races that have an
exp penalty (Barb, Ogre, Iksar, Troll) . The exp penatly is applied to
normal Exp but not to your AAs and (supposedly) if you split it the
exp penalty is applied to both. Never checked it though, I'm one of
those that prefers to go all or nothing with exp. 

If that did turn out to be true, conversely a halfling should get an
exp bonus if he splits his exp between the two. <g>
