since everyone has said necro/sk, i would like to share my own thoughts

in group pvp, one side usually targets the other side's clerics, since dead
clerics = most crippling

this is because clerics are very important

the enemy's cleric is evil (relative to you), and since he keeps all the
other evil people alive, he could be considered the most evil of them all

oh, and pick innoruuk =) wield the hate

4 out of 6 of the clerics i've played have been dark elves, so i might be a
bit biased
