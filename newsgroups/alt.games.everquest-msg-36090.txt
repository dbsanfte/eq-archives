You get skills at level 1. Those Skills already have a 'skill' point in
them. They will go up automatically through use.

Skills that you don't get at level 1 need to be 'primed'. You prime a skill
by putting One point into it. You can put more but you HAVE to put one skill
point into it. Otherwise you'll either 1) Won't be able to use the skill or
2) Won't ever increase in that skill

I'm not exactly a veteran in this game so if I'm forgetting anything or am
wrong tell me please
