It's worse actually.  Delibrate training were occuring in LGuk over
fabled lord and frenzied.  One of the trainer were in the same raid
party that was trying to kill the frenzied. >_< Got himself killed
while the rest of the group lived because he never considered fabled
lord has 3.3k backstab =D  Naturally by the time GM gets around to
clearing the petition delibrate traind, KSing, and ninja looting, the
offending toon were long gone and with no crime to witness, GM would
simply write back "Sorry nothing we can do"

Fabled group weren't the only problem, there were widespread KSing and
ninja-looting in scavenger hunt, especially in Burning Wood where the
wasps were being stingy with the collector's wing (no pun intended)
Problems aside, you could do the whole hunt for under 30 minutes with
a fast horse or drog or bard song.

I had no trouble with fabled evil eyes (65 beast, 65 pally, and 57
cleric) and got a 100% 10 slot bag. Sure beats paying 5k for the
leatherfoot haversack or tinker bags. We would have stayed to get more
for other 2 in group but the cleric LDed and never came back.

Grr... Still ticked off at tailoring nerf.  I'm glad I got my baking
to 300 and pottery to 267 so not much work there.  If only they hadn't
nerfed tailoring... >_<  Mentel note: must learn the recipe for
flaming bag of poo and slip them into CS Home zone (yes they do exists
for GMs only)

I guess they were too lazy to look up the map.  But then again, SoE
didn't post a proper map at all and the map still shows the old bazaar
in the mix.  I've spent some times deleting old lines and the closed
off halls in the new bazaar. Lavastorm map is also the same thing, new
and old mixed together for no reason.

One of the hall in the Diamond room (Bazaar section) didn't have a
door but the hall was still blocked. /bugged it as it was still there
when I rezoned and rebooted EQ.

If there's one drawback to scavenger hunt and Fableds, people who were
LFG for good xp only, Oow, DoN, or LDoN were stuck waiting a long
time.  Most of the mobs in Kunark were green to people who did the
hunts or fabled raids.
