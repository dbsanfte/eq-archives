There are some servers set aside which are already PvP. There are I
think four of these, and they all end in Zek. The other servers are
default non-PvP, but there is a way to make yourself become PvP (hand in
your book of Order to the priest of Discord in your hometown), if you
really want to. Folks who opt for PvP on non-PvP servers have a very
rough road, and usually don't get very high.

Sometimes, players get in a set group, and do not wish to add lots of
new folks. Certain guilds prefer to group only with guildies.

But most of the time, as long as you are hunting in a place appropriate
to your level, you can easily pick up group mates, and make freinds. You
can form your own guild, or join an existing one. I never had trouble
making new friends.
