Level 46 (I think) warrior got mugged, the Brownie Scout was still dark
blue to my 46th Necro.  Did anyone ask if the guy had even been in lesser
fay (it's not exactly a well used zone).  I should have checked, but
didn't.  However, I'm used to grouping with people who believe the point of
grouping is to work together, and if that means getting somewhere, then you
get there together.

Too many times have our characters been mugged by an unexpected mob, either
wandering, trained, or mooching about.  If we'd been travelling as a group,
the Brownie Scout would have died in seconds, instead of being trained to
the dungeon entrance by the warrior so we could kill it.

<shrug> Horses for courses, but for me, being grouped starts when you hit
follow, and that means sticking together.
