There are a couple of vendors that you could try. Theres a vendor near in
ec, near the wc zoneline that selles all sorts of spell components. probably
common residents faction, but its worth a try. Seconds, theres a gnome
vendor in rathe mountains, in the "druid area" just north of the "clops
area" where you zone in from LR. Not positive if he sells cat eye agate, but
I expect the faction would be indifferent here.
Youd also quite likely find one by checking all the vendors in EK. They drop
off the gnoll reavers there so you might be lucky.
If it were me, id just make a mule and go buy it in fp. *ducks the flames*
