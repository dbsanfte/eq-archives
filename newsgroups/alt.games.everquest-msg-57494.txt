Umm, I believe this is the count of the people *playing the game on the
servers*. Do you seriously think 97,000 people out of 400,000 subscribers
are logged in to the Sony website gazing at Fippy's Facts at the same time
or giving out hints on the Newbie Board?

Total server count is very useful. If it's zero, all the servers are down
and I don't have to waste time running EQ. If it's half normal there may be
a problem with the login server, and I know it's probably not my ISP or
connection that's at fault.
