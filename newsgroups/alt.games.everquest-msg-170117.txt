That reminds me of the poor Iksar monk the other day, who was killing guards
in Highkeep and
had for some obscure reason got himself a bind at the bank (You see where
this is going, right?).
And needed to go afk, so he FD'd, failed FD and hit the button again before
it recycled and then left his computer.

Needless to say Captain Bosec shortly spawned (Right next to him) and
started whacking away at the guy, giving him a nice deathloop that lasted
about 6 lvls before the guy cama back to his computer and made the area at
bank so laggy with his 100+ corpses lying around.
Everyone in zone cringed whenever they made a bankrun, feeling oh, so sorry
for the poor monkey..
