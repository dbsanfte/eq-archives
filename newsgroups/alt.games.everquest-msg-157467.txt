Eeep!  <runs over to kaev and waves a hand in front of his face>  Bards are
not overpowered.  Bards are perfectly balanced.  This is not the class you
are looking for.

I think it's more that the types of people that can really take advantage of
a bard's power are the type of people who can quickly comprehend a situation
and adapt to fit it.  It requires a bit of good judgment.  These are also
the qualities that tell the player not to flaunt a good deal.  Those players
who don't have those qualities don't tend to make good bards and probably
think the class is broken.

Bards take alot of work to play.  With much work comes much reward.  There's
got to be some reason to play a class that can get quite mentally
exhausting.

Anyways, we're too busy twisting to brag.
