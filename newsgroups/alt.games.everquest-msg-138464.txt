Ive never done it, but here's what I would say. Buy a fishbone earring or a
rebreather, both of these are EB wearable (no clicking, just perma-EB). Keep
it IN the bank, NEVER hunt with it on you. When you die, get it from the
bank, enter zone, do the CR, then immediately put it in the bank. Keep a few
around in case you die with one on you. They may be expensive (not sure of
price) but invaluable if you hunt in the grey a lot.
