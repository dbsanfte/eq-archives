Step 1 as a porter I am bound in WL at the SS zone if anyone wants to pay
for a port into WL I gate first and check the zone.
I dont know the actual time frame but I only see Wuoshi 1 day out of 4 or 5.
Witch leaves 2 options wait till the next day or hire someone to drag your
corpse I have had my corpse pulled from Wuoshi by someone who is not KOS
with the CoV. BTW SS inhabitants are on the same faction as Woushi, you need
to kill lots and lots and lots more Giants to become NON KOS with Woushi. If
on Prexus my Monk can pull your corpse to a safe location.
