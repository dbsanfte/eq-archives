One last time for the idiot (that's you Ben, a word you chose, amazing
how well it fits your behavior here).  When you post something
that has different meaning than you intended, then you can either (a)
amend your statement to make your intended meaning clear, or (b) show
yourself to be a conceited ass by thrashing about insisting that your
words have a meaning other than that which stands starkly in black
and white....

Note that you did not say "That's exactly [the sort of thing]..." or
use any other non-exclusive construction.  Your words are clear and
unambiguous, and wrong.  Your pathetic thrashing afterwards shows only
a childish inability to admit to even so minor an error as having
worded your reply poorly.
