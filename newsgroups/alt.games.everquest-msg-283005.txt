Close.  The characters get a share proportionate to their previously-earned
xp (excluding xp sent to AA and LAA, I believe).  This is NOT linear with
level - it's quite likely that a level 56 has 4x or more experience points
than a level 47.

This has been a problem forever - the actual "good xp group" range is 2-5 
levels (varies by actual level), not the 12 levels or whatever that Sony
claims.  Beyond that the lower levels fall further behind, rather than
catching up.  

This is rational, in that the lower levels (except a twinked cleric with CH
and a lot of mana) simply contribute far less to the group, but it's socially
difficult, even if all the characters are you :)

My recommendation: ungroup the 55 and 56 (but don't let them KS the other 4),
put the 54 on 100% AA, and play that way until everyone's within a few levels
of each other.
