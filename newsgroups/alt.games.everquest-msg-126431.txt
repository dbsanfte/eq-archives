   That's logical, but I've gotten /tells from the illogical more than once.  Some
barb was asking me for my silly little %10 res in the Paludal Caverns.  He was around
level 20, if I remember right.  And he was in zone.  Do you know how long it would
take make back that %10 of experience just by hunting in PC?  Less time than it would
take for the rez effect to wear off, for chrissakes.  Heck, I forgo rezing myself a
couple of times there for that very reason.  PC has an insane experience modifier,
and time is exp.  But no, this guy wanted me to come back from the other side of the
zone to "save" him that exp.  /sigh
