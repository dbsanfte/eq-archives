I don't think you understand my point... they may find it harder to get
someone to have sex with them if they don't have protection... but which
would you rather have, your kid having sex, but safe sex, because he/she got
ahold of condoms, or your kid coming home pregnant or carrying STDs because
you didn't let them have a condom in a misguided attempt to prevent them
from having sex?
