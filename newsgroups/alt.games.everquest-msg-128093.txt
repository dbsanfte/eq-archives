Guy was hallucinating then, or yanking your chain.  Spiderling silks drop
at normal rate in Feerrot, although there are usually a great many spiders
and spiderlings that all drop them... it is indeed the best place for 'ling.
There is currently, however, practically no market for 'ling.

Spider silks sell easily on Morell Thule for 40pp a stack, due to the recent
addition of the POTC quest, which has as one component a robe using
spider silks as one ingrediant, and the only drop ingrediant.  The quest is
for a great pair of earrings that any level 60 would probably be proud to
wear, and the robe retails readily for 5kpp... while requiring roughly 300pp
in ingrediants that aren't used until you succede, plus 10pp or so in gems
and 6 spider silks... at 150 skill we were going thru roughly 120 spider
silks per success.

Carrion spiders in EK drop up to four silks, and Crags drop up to 6, they
spawn quite a lot although being a tracker helps a lot.  Dunno if either would
be exp for you though.
