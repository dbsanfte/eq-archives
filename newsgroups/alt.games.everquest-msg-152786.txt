No Ben, not quite. If this was intended as a joke, I have a great sense of
humor, and will accept it as such. Humor has a way of being lost over the
internet however, and if it wasn't meant as a joke, I find it offensive. If
you truly want to learn what a pagan is, I will post a few links that might
help.

I apologize if the links do not work, and you have to cut and paste them, as
I am quite ignorant of how to use newsreaders for anything except reading,
and this is the only way I could find to paste the links
