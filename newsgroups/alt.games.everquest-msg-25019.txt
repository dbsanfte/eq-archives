jaZZ,

I truly understand, since I was both a guild officer and a member
leaving for an uberguild.  I tried and tried to find a solution that
worked for everyone, but eventually realized that the only way to keep
the 46+ players in the guild was to have enough high-level players to
do at least small raids regularly.  You then end up in a chicken and
egg situation, where the only way to keep high-level folks is to have
high-level folks.  
There are a couple of possible ways to keep your higher level folks,
but they all require some compromise or sacrifice, and none of them
are guaranteed to work.  The first is to have a meeting of all the
members 40+ or so and see what their goals are.  If they are
interested in 40-55ish raids, planes, velious dungeons, grouping in
Kunark, etc, then you are much better off than if they are interested
in 55+ raids, ToV, Veeshan's Peak, etc.  Assuming that they really
just want to go on level appropriate raids, and not the end-game mobs,
you can either set up alliences with other guilds in similar
situations or try to power-level enough characters to 46+ to have a
dozen or so high-level characters on at regular play hours.  Guild
alliances can be a great help, and if they work out, they may actually
lead to guild mergers, which in many cases is preferable to losing all
higher level players.  
Power-leveling players to create a critical mass of 46+ players is
more difficult, and it may change the flavor of your guild.  It's only
really useful if you have enough folks that can be powerleveled in a
relatively short period of time (say within 3-4 weeks) and that want
to move up that quickly.  The benefit of this is that if you really
are a guild of friends first, you should be able to keep most of your
folks in the guild, and possibly actually become even closer as a
guild.  The downside is that if your higher level folks are really
antsy to move up, they may become bored and resentful being expected
to powerlevel folks who haven't put as much work into gaining levels
as they have.
Another possibility would be to announce your intention of becoming a
higher-level guild, and opening up applications for folks of the
appropriate level who don't want to go through the pain and hoopla of
a restrictive uber-guild, though this will require a well-publicized
and active raid schedule to entice folks to join.  
I would certainly recommend that you encourage your former members to
keep their alts in the guild, and encourage them to hunt with you
regularly.  From what I've been reading about many uberguilds, folks
who liked a smaller guild may decide that it's worth the work to bring
their guild up to appropriate levels rather than deal with a bunch of
arrogant pricks who use Everquest to compensate for real-life
shortcomings.  :)
I finally did moved my baby necro twink from my old guild to my
present guild after 6 months, but only because I only use that
character when checking to see whether it's safe to log back into a
zone after a big 'Oh, shit!", and the lack of a guild channel was a
problem.  I still do pickup groups with my old guild, and chat with
them almost every day.  Hell, I even pop in on guild meetings from
time to time.  Just because I had different goals in the game doesn't
mean that I liked them any less.
