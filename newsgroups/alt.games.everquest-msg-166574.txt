I've read good Vox guides, but what is the "favorite" guide to waxing Naggy?
I'm looking to wack him after the patch Wednesday if someone doesn't beat me
to him, and I'm still looking for info. I've been on one failed Naggy raid
(Absolutely, positively knew it would fail, but went anyway to get the lay
of the land and to analyze what seemed to be good and what didn't), but I
want this one to be a smooth as I can possibly make it.

With Vox, you've got the key things llike stunning, staying away from walls,
watching the pits, etc.. With Naggy, there's no CH to deal with, and I
understand the summoning problem to be a bit less too. I'm liking the
strategy that sends in a monk to run to a back corner and FD followed by a
charge from the MA/SA group (moves him to the back so healers can enter the
room with some safety range to them). I'd just like to hear more approaches.

Thanks,

Sing
