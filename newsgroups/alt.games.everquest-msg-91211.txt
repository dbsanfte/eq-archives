Do not use a single post as an excuse to strike out at every
non-american. It is exactly that racist attitude that you seem to be
attacking.

Less of the flag waving crap, if you don't mind. Maybe people are not
telling you how much America sux, maybe they are telling you how much
you sux.

If people are telling you America sux, then stop and consider that
maybe you are just confirming everything they think about Americans
when you say things like that.
