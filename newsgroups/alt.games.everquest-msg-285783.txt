Call me a kook, but that was one of the things I liked most about EQ - 
the dependance on certain classes for certain things. It made for many 
more opportunities for interaction among players. One thing I've found is 
that when there is a viable solo path, far too many players choose it.

Granted, I, too, hated it when there were none of the particular class 
you needed at the time available. Personally, however, I was quite 
content taking the bad with the good in this case.
