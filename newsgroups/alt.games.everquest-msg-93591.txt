What I've been doing lately with the xp bubbles and the blue line is this:

Since are five bubbles, each yellow-orange filled bubble must represent 20%
of the total experience needed to gain the next level. The blue line has to
stretch across the xp bar once for each bubble of experience, therefore if
each bubble of orange/yellow is 20%, then each bubble crossed by the blue
line is 4%. So if my xp bar shows two filled bubbles and the blue line is
stretched across two bubbles also, then I'm 48% of the way toward the next
level (2 filled * 20% = 40%, and 2 blue-lined * 4% = 8%: So, 48%).

Is this accurate?
