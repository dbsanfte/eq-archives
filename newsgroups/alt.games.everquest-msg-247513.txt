As far as I can tell, no, you can't actually "camp" mobs. Which is
great. You keep moving. Add to that the very low downtime, the action
keeps moving at a great pace in the game, which is what keeps it fun
in spite of the simplicity in certain areas usually thought to be
critical for MMORPGs ( Loot and PvP - the latter of which I seriously
disagree with being critical, but, to each his own).
