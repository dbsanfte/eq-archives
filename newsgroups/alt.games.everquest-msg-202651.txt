    How about we rip your sorry ass instead?

    Damn straight. No more whining from people in PoK that think because I'm
not anon that I'm some sort of buff vending machine. Stick in a peridot or
two, and of course she'll crap out some Virtues for us! Well, not any more.
You want cleric buffs, or enchanter buffs? GROUP WITH ONE FOR XP.

> boring as shit

    If you found grouping for XP "boring as shit", you needed to find a new
game. Because buddy, it doesn't get better as you level. It gets worse.

    Given that you're whining about a restriction that prevents people under
level 43 from getting a buff, sounds like you need to get off your ass and
level.
