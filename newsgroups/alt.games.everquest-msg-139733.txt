    You have your default 50 points in Spec: Evoc, I bet, so that's about
2.5% savings. 8 mana saved, 317 mana cost.

    FT 1 and BAotR - 7 mana/tick. Medding - 25 mana/tick (I've seen as low
as 22 mana/tick for this, so use that as another possible value for personal
calculations).

    Judgement is pretty good for that. ;-)

> Unbuffed, how long will that take me?

    32 mana/tick with BAotR and Earring of the Solstice, mana cost is 317
mana, so 10 ticks or one minute.

> How about with KEI ( a not infrequent occurrance)

    KEI adds 15 mana/tick, so as a rough calculation it adds 50% to your
mana regen, reducing med time to 2/3rds or 40 seconds-ish.

    For the first case, 925 DAM/60 secs = 15 DPS.
    For the second case, 925 DAM/40 secs = 23 DPS.

    I'm doing a lot of rounding here - no accounting for the tick to cast or
the mana you regen while standing to cast. I'm sure all you need are
ballpark figures anyways.
