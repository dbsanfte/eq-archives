First of all, the KB says it's not a win9x problem it's a win95/windows for
workgroups problem.....you should have no problems putting 512 meg in a win
98/me machine....There's another issue, I think when you hit the 768meg
area, in win 98, there's also a fix for it in the Microsoft knowledge
base....

I have heard of cacheman, but have not tried it....plenty of people say it's
good, but I'm the type of person that doesn't like run things in the
background....
