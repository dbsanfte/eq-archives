As more and more homes sign up for broadband internet service do you think
it is reasonable for game designers to build next generation MMORPGs that
require such high bandwidth connections to play?  I ask this because over
the holidays I purchased XBOX Live and have loved the experience so far.
Microsoft requires a broadband connection to use XBOX Live.  Having a
connection like this allows real-time voice communications to take place
during game play.  It also insures that all players are on a near equal
footing when it comes to lag during game play.  I remember a Shaman in our
guild that notoriously took about 30 seconds longer to zone than anyone else
in the guild.

Having the ability to voice chat with everyone in your group or to initiate
a voice chat session in tells while also having a game optimized for high
speed clients would seem to add to the EQ experience.
