From somebody who has been using SGI workstations for years, they are
actually surprisingly slow for 3d -at least compared with the latest
game cards- but of course they make up for this on things like memory
bandwith and floating point precision. You really have to go up to the
high-end of SGI's range (Octane2 and above) to find machines that can
kick the ass of a modern PC with a GeForce card.

As for Crays... Well, I don't know if the EQ engine is parallelizable at
all, if it isn't, it would have to run on a single-proc vector machine,
and I think (gut feeling, not supported by hard facts) that while it
would be fast, it wouldn't be overwhelmingly so.
