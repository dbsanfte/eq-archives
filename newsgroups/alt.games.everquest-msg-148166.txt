And I wish I would have known about Geerlok Gemsetters before hand. I
also didnt know about the Grandmaster Trophy quest. Hell, that looks
easy now with only a 107 pottery skill needed. Anyone heard about
Planes of Power expansion allowing you to be grandmaster in more than
one skill? Also, what sort of services do you provide for players as a
GM jeweler? Imbued stuff? I did it just so I could pump out jewelry.
