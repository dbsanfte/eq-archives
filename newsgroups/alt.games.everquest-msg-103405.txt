Kill the Poachers!!!!!!!

Just don't set foot in Qeynos anymore and forget about getting your epic
without some serious faction fixing.  Oh ya, don't get too close to anyone
in the Karanas either.  Heck, you might even get a whack or two at the
little peck and grab a GBS too. It'll take ya all the way to 34 at about 2
hours per level.
I'll let you figure out who the poachers are.
