I can certainly understand the frustration involved.  I too have had that
problem.  While I have managed to get past most of the dangerous points
without death, I have also had trouble gathering people to take on the group
encounters, including Rockbelly (A Troll ghost quest) on the Isle of Refuge.
What I have managed to do however, is form a group of my own.  When I start
on the Isle, I see at least one or two others who started at about the same
time, I also often see them running back to the "trainer" type NPCs to
continue their quests.  Knowing that I will be asked to kill Grimgash on the
4th (or is it 5th) quest I keep my eyes open for the others who I know
started at the same time I did and who likely are at the same point in their
progression.

My point is, I form the groups I need by watching those around me and then
talking to them directly.  I do not wait for some poor slob (that is not
directed at you, I have heard a good amount of that every time I am on the
Isle) to start whining in /ooc or /shout that they really need a group for
orc cave.  Be proactive.  Learn the secrets of the island and offer to show
others the tricks.  Have you faced the Goblin Chieftain?  The Warmongers in
the Brute camp?  How about that mean old shark?  Or have you talked to the
gnome and done his part gathering quest?  There are a good number of things
besides the Orc that you can show others.  Use that to your advantage.
