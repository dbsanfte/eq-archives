Has nothing to do with drivers, OS, etc.  It's whether or not the custom
skin you were using is "broken" according to the changes they just made
regarding custom skins.

In general, the simpler your modifications, the less likely you are to have
to worry about it.  My "default" custom skin that I use didn't have any
problems at all.  I have another custom skin that is very heavily modified
that crashed out with about 20 errors in the UI error log file.  :)
