Will tell you about Provoke.  The ability does two things.  1. It
immediately increases your hate by between 85 and 100 points (fixed amount
based on level). 2. It will increase Modify Hate by 25 to 45, which means
for the duration of the minute all your attacks are going to generate more
hate than they usually would.

Has the "spell" data for all of the melee abilities if you are interested in
knowing what exactly it is they do.
