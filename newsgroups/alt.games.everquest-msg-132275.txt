Well if you have been here long enough to ask that question for the
reason I am thinking you are then either you have been lurking for
longer than I thought or you have changed your name.  In either case
rest easy, I only ask that from people who say that there is an exact
respawn time but won't back up the claim.

Actually EQ2 could very well be a boon to EQ as much as a destroyer. 
Since the gaming system in EQ2 will be so much different that what
current EQ players are used to there will be some discontent despite
flashy new graphics.  These folks will be playing along side folks who
have never played EQ before and as complainers are rarely silent even
the new folks will be aware of this discontent.  Both of those groups of
folks are candidates for playing original EQ, the former to return to
past happiness, the latter to see what all those complainers liked so
much about the old game.

This has actually been seen to happen with the release of AO and DAoC. 
In both cases the new games brought in new gamers to the genre, who upon
realizing that they didn't like the new game but the genre appealed to
them, followed EQ players returning and began to play EQ as well.  I
seem to recall one of the Sony folks saying similar in an interview,
that the new games are actually good for the old ones as folks are drawn
to the hype and enter a genre they may have not previously.  If their
initial game doesn't work out then they start exploring the genre and
many ended up coming from AO/DAoC to play EQ as opposed to the other way
around.

If you look at the transition the game has gone through in the last few
months in terms of dumbing down, making it easier, removing rules that 
prevented  idiots from naming their characters like crack whores...etc.
it becomes clear that Sony is repositioning the game to appeal to a new
audience.  Sort of what you might expect them to do if they intend to
continue milking the cash cow long after they expand the herd.  EQ will
remain, but will become more of a children's game while initially EQ2
will follow the original path of attempting to provide a challenge for
more serious gamers.  That will eventually continue down the path that
the original did and that is what will be the end of EQ once EQ2 is
dumbed down enough to appeal to children.  Of course it will also open
the door to EQ3 <EG>.

We can come back in two years and see which of us was more correct in
their divination of the future, there will be no real answer as to which
of us is right till then.  In the meanwhile, if you are into
prognostication, perhaps we can continue our suppositions though I would
prefer that we switch to quatrain formatting if we do so <EG>.
