I'm still hearing mixed things on when mobs go light blue at the new levels.
Most of the people I have talked to in game that are 61+ have said it is
still 15ish levels for dark blue.  When people hit 61, and saw a lot of mobs
go lt blue on them, it was because those mobs were level 45.  Could someone
here that is actually higher than 60 maybe really confirm this one way or
the other?
