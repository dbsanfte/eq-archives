LOL Hate to tell you this, but I love Lesser Fay. =P Won't do you much
good at 29; but it rocks for a baby druid (say 10-15ish.) Camo to get to
bandits alive, harmony to break the camp, and the hunting can be
uninterrupted. Experience and loot are both really nice for the level
and you have no competition for spawns, plus you can work on the tunare
only neck quest at night. I hunted there extensively with my main when
she was just a baby druid and I took my twinkie halfling druid on the
other account there as well, just to reminisce. Deaths are actually
fairly rare once you learn a little about the zone. After you get
bigger, wolf form makes the zone quite safe other than that damn black
horse (she's not always up) and fairy guards are a good target.  And
now, at 53, I get some revenge on the brownie guards from time to time.

Other good druid zones are lavastorm, the karanas, lake ill omen (much
as I despise the place), iceclad, eastern wastes (this one is awesome!
good from about 35-53 so far! lots of animals and nothing sees invis!),
and great divide.
