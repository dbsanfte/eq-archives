A few days ago, I was in the Oasis, waiting for the barge at the docks, when
I heard:

8^| yells for help to the left.

Okay, at first I was thinking, who the blazes could that be?  I -know- you
can't pick that for a name...  Must be a glitch... Oh well...  Then, a group
of us went into Kedge Keep last night.  There were ten people in the entire
zone - 6 of us in the same guild, in the same group.  (and we started a chat
channel just for Kedge so that we could work together... The people already
there were very cool, showing us the ropes to handle pulls in that
dungeon...  (very underpopulated dungeon...  and -great- XP).  Anyway, we
get down to the second floor, and start pulling Mermaids....  I sit back in
the corner and heal as necessary, and all of a sudden, I hear:

8^| yells for help (blah,blah)...

Huh??  Okay, there are only 10 people in the entire zone.  I asked people if
they heard that, but most said no (one person in my group said yeah)..
Could have gotten lost in battle spam, or whatever...

Has anyone else received this message?  Or is this a case of another GM
playing around?  ( Like the one time in EC where I kept getting the message
"You are out of food", then followed by "You have plenty of food.   ~burp~"
Heh... :)
