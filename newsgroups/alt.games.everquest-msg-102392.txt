Tailoring don't go up ASAP. It would be *easier* to collect 20 times the
ingredients necessary and gamble on that 5% guaranteed success rate.

Here's how I'm doing it:

Make a level one necro. Not an iksar- need old world pelts.

Hunt black wolves to level 3. Hunt spiderlings to level 6. Save all pelts,
silks and food items for baking.

Hunt black bears, large spiders. Then young kodiaks and giant spiders. Save
all pelts, silks and food items for baking.

Move to Upper Guk. Hunt spiders in the heart spider room. Save all pelts,
silks and food items for baking.

Took a break and hunted Gargoyles in OOT for money and faction.

Hunted crag spiders in East Karanas, with the occassional lion. Save all
pelts, silks and food items for baking.

Planning to move to Stonebrunt next level (27). Save all pelts, silks and
food items for baking.

By then, around next month, I should be able to get tailoring through most
of Wu's. May need to hunt more spiders though.

It's been about month so far. I'm sitting on 2.5 10 slot backpacks of silk
before collecting more pelts- because I'm hunting where I get XP.

Other options include auctioning: WTB pelts 2pp each. WTB stack of silks
20pp each. Note: HQ bear pelts are worth a great deal more.

Progression is patchwork to 26, raw silk to 36, studded to 56 (need MQ),
cured silk to 68? Reinforced leather to 102 (need HQ), then Wu's to 158.

After that, you need Acrylia from the moon, or your cultural. The joke is:
First you take your level 60 necro and go camp greens... Well, I'm making a
necro as I collect my tailoring supplies.

Hope this helps,
-georg
