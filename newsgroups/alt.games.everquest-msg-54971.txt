Mobs start in the low-mid 40's there.  The wizard TL spot is quite
dangerous (the druid spot is considerably safer), and there's a fair
chance you'll be aggroed by something on zone in.  SoW is pretty much a
necessity if you're going to make it to the zone - and the type of mob
which aggroes you is also important.  Melee only mobs (wurms,
wyverns...) are easy to outrun, but if a chromadrac spots you and
you're under 40, I suspect you'd be quickly toasted (they dispell &
DoT).  Chromadracs really suck.
