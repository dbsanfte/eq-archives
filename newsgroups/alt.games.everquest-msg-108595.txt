I have been getting error 1017  while trying to log onto my usual server
(AB), this bumps me back to the server select screen and tells me to try
again. I can get onto others with no problems, but not the one I want.

Can anyone suggest a fix for this? or do i just have to wait for a
mysterious network problem to get fixed?
