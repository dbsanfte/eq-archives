If you want to fear kite things, then you just need some dps, so take your
pick from several classes for that.
For charm kiting they are going to be nerfing it. I dont know the details
yet, but if its a rule like "If your pet does over 50% damage then blah
blah" you may want someone to outdamage your pet so you get xp, or
alternatively have another charmer. I guess we will find out next patch.
