    Unless you're in Sol B. Or Guk dead side. Or Dreadlands. Or Sebilis.
Quick - name the 36 popular level 35 plus zones where Invis is just as good!
More proof that nine out of every ten statistics are made up. 8)

    (A) They're worse than monks, rogues, and shadow knights. Period.
    (B) If Invis is the criteria by which a CR can be measured, then
remember that when those melees are chillin' in town at their bind point
they can purchase Invis potions.
    (C) I never, EVER stated that "ability to CR" should be a criteria for
disparity in bind rules. I saw YOU state that casters could get their bodies
with ease, and this was even more unfair given the bind rules. I have
pointed out that you are wrong - when something goes wrong, and a manual CR
is warranted, the three classes I've listed get asked to pull the bodies
out. Using "a melee's poor CR ability" to support an argument for removing
preferrential binding is false, as they don't have poor CR abilities.
