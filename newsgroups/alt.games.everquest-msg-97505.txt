At 20 points your progress doing patchwork is about gone.
Unless you want to make use of ruined skins to make patchwork to sell
to vendors (don't even bother to try to sell it to players on an
established server) go with what I outline below instead.

No, what I do I pay no attention to an auction by someone who is such
a jackass that they don't include a price. I don't have time to play
their stupid "guess the price game" and if I happen to come close
enough to their high end price they go "ok." Its just really rude to
not include the price or the stats and a sure way for me to give
someone else my business. When I auction myself I include the correct
name (no acronym crap), the stats and the price I think is about
right. Its funny though, people are so used to it being done the other
way I get tells of "how much?" and I reply "The auction says how much,
1 k plat" etc.

Look at prices others sell that junk for. CB belts might go for 1 or 2
plat each (people use them for xp quests) Really you should use all
bone chips and cb belts yourself in the xp/faction quests and not sell
them.

Okay, now here is how to actually make good money at tailoring at your
level while skipping all the crap. First go to www.eqtraders.com, look
at the recipes for skinning knife (under smithing) and leather
padding.

Put a few points in smithing and make a skinning knife. On a new char
at level 1 with 5 points It took me only 3 tries. Buy a large sewing
kit, or use a small (I prefer large because it has more slots making
other recipies easier but small is fine for now) Get any low - high
quality animal skins and skin the high or medium to low (skinning
knife in sewing kit with the skin, makes it go down by one)

2 spiderling silk make a silk thread and you combine that with a low
quality wolf, cat or bear skin to make a leather padding. These are
easy to make at very low tailoring skill. You can sell them to other
players for about 80 plat a stack. As you make some  more money, you
can buy out vendors like the gfay newb lift vendor wood elf lady. If
its been a few days since a patch, she usually has tons of bone chips,
low - high quality wolf skins and spiderling silks on her. You should
find many posts about vendor delving or "diving" on www.eqtraders.com 
also (in message board area or elsewhere)

The best places to do this while still getting xp, if you are low
enough, are in west and east commons and misty thicket. There just are
not really enough wolf spawns in gfay (though its the best place to
buy them out.. weird.) Any high quality bear skin you get DON'T SKIN
DOWN, instead sell it to a player for 30 - 40 plat in an auction. 

My dark elf cleric of innoruk was running around the commons raising
faction on any orc pawns, orcs and such while killing bears too and I
sold 3 high quality bear skins in a packager deal for 80 plat. She's a
twink but the 80 plat was still nice to buy another bunch of cloth
shirt runs from a vendor in the commons to give to Altunic the pally
guy and now she is finally indiff with north freeport clerics of marr,
quite a feat ;) I must have got one murder hit against the militia I
forgot about though, since getting the clerics to indiff I pushed
militia to threaten (the quest gives a minus) So its off to high hold
keep I guess.. bleah.
