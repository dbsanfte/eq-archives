I'll have to second that. I do try to limit the twinkage I lay on my
newbs through the first ten levels though (sometimes to little avail
:) I hate getting to level ten with the melee/offense/defense skills
of a five. Shouldn't let it bother me too much. Great gear, while
actually causing the desparity in the first place, does a good deal to
make up for it when the levelling slows and the skills start catching
up.
