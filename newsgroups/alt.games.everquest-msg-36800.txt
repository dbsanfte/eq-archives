Hi all,

  I witnessed a duel yesterday that resulted in a suspension (or at least
that's what I was told by the person who was suspended).  An Enchanter was
dueling a Wizard,  Chanter mezzed Wizard, Chanter made Wizard attack guards.
Or at least made him try to do so, hehe.
  Guards wiped out Wizard, Wizard lost a level, Wiz petitioned and won.
  I've never dueled.  You don't lose exp if you duel correctly, right?
Since I've never dueled, I don't know if this is considered dirty pool or
otherwise.
  What do the rest of you think?

Sharad 15th lvl (forever it seems,hehe) Necro, Drinal
