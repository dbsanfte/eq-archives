Well, I don't have that... but I do have a chessboard... and most chess 
variants are much quicker than a full game of chess, so it's good when 
time is limited.  It also tends to even the odds somewhat when you're 
playing a game where you're both unfamiliar with it, but you already know 
all the rules.

It's very important, however, to keep careful track of exactly what 
variant you're playing. :)
