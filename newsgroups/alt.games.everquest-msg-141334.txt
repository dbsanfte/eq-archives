If you are talking about the modified UI skins that display maps (I 
haven't seen them myself, /glare Mac), I don't see why... They are 
logical extensions of the UI's customizability, and besides, they are 
exclusively client-side, so Verant would have a hard time detecting them.

If what you are talking about are the ones that display your postion on 
a map by capturing /loc commands directly from the log file, same goes... 
Verant wouldn't be able to detect their use.

Of course what they could do (and ought to have done long ago, although 
it's probably too late now), is to finally getting around to disabling /
loc. :)
