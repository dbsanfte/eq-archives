You talk about the impact as though magician should spend more, though you
led with the alternative of the magician getting a free ride.  Just a
little bizarre.  :)

Anyway...  In the first place, the number of class-specific items isn't
huge, especially in PoP.  And second, it simply doesn't work that way. 
There will always be early spenders, and there will always be early spenders
going broke, thus making room for someone else.  The benefit the magician
gets by being the only magician over the 7th warrior is getting an item 6
fights sooner, at the same price.  Which is a tangible benefit, no doubt,
but isn't a problem with base prices in place to regulate it.

It's also the concept of cyclical progression.  The first-timer pays a lot
for a sword.  The next guy pays less.  The next guy pays less.  The next two
guys pay base value.  The overall ability of the guild is improved "X" and
we move up to a mob that drops sword+1.  Warrior #6 gets to be the
first-timer and pays a lot for it.  The next guy pays less, etc., etc., and
then the guy that got the sword first off the last mob is probably one of
the later to upgrade off this new mob, or perhaps the first to get sword+2
off the next mob up.  :)

But why not just wait til final upgrade?  Cause you don't get into Time
wearing cloth.  Hell, you don't get into my guild unless you can already
hold your own, and we don't have the highest requirements by far.  :)

Mains first, apps and alts second.  If the magician is bidding to sell, the
warrior is free to bid against him.  There's no loot council, there's simply
a rule (as was stated), mains first, apps and alts second.

That serves no useful purpose for the guild or any individual *and* causes
discontent in regards to no-drop items, and there simply aren't enough
droppable items to make a new rule just for them.

We do have some rules to deal with people that are specifically asked to
bring an alt instead of their main.  I'm sometimes forced to bring out my
magician for CoH'ing for instance.  But otherwise in my guild you have *a*
main and that's who you raid with.  To change mains actually does incur an
RP penalty, the only one other than simply leaving the guild, because it
hurts the guild's overall equipment progression.  In other words, if that
guy loves his wizard, he should have applied with his wizard.  We'll find
another warrior.

Again, you decide your own need with this system.  If the warrior really
wants to bid on that all/all +50 cha range item, he can.  But you simply
can't bid on items you can't equip.  Again, there aren't enough droppable
items to make them an issue or important enough for a different rule, and
even then most droppable items go to guild bank anyway because they are
inferior to the no-drop stuff that's already rotting.

Neither droppable.  See above.  :)

Though someday I will sell my AoW pants I'm sure.  Or at least I hope, I
haven't been real impressed with the alternatives yet.  :)  That's not an
issue, once you buy it it's yours.  You can expect scorn and ridicule if the
item shows up in the Bazaar the next day, though.  Peer pressure is a
perfectly acceptable regulator.

We could.  But generally if it makes it past bidding for mains *and*
apps/alts, it's not much of a wanted item (to us).  In a raid of fifty level
65s, there's at least 3 of each class represented among their twinks.  :)

Honestly, I'm not sure how it could even be abused.  Just about any target
with something that someone would want that is up is worth hitting.  In
fact, I'd go so far as to say you're more right than I originally thought. 
I will pick targets based on knowing it might drop something I need, or
might drop something someone else needs.  But since there are few mobs that
drop just one item, and the bidding is open to everyone (as in, I think I
pushed to hit TZ like 9 times before I got battlefists, getting outbid
twice...) I don't think it could ever rise to the level of favoritism.

It's just the basics of having a working system.  If a system forces more RP
out than comes in, eventually you have items rotting that multiple people
*want* to bid on.  If a system doesn't dictate a certain minimum, there is
inflation, exacerbated by, for instance, the solitary magician who can now
outbid all other int casters, and because it is a lot more appealing to wait
until it drops to nothing.  It is an economy of sorts.

I've yet to see one that handles anything thrown at it as well as ours.  As
I said, it's adapted from Vindi to elementals, and from 10 people to 100.

The one "flaw" is that on some odd and fairly rare items, the base price
comes out funny.  Most of the time a bit low, which is of course self
correcting through bidding (when a 4-rp item hits 20 every time it
drops...), but occasionally we get an odd item like a 20 cha cleric-only
shield.  We've been known to exercise discretion and chop base price in half
to try and jumpstart bidding, but generally the item rots anyway.  :)  Rots
are just an accepted part of the system.
