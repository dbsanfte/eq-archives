I hope to hell not.
The problem with ToV is the stupid "anti-zone crash AoE" code which
they HAD to put in because of the idiotic zone design.

Verant couldn't keep the damn zone from crashing so when you have a
lot of people in the zone, the number of dragon AoE drops
SIGNIFICANTLY.

I remember one time when there were about 150 people in ToV.  One
guild who were killing Lendiniara reported *3* AoE the entire fight.

3 AoEs from Lendiniara is just plain stupid and basically make her a
gimp (more so than she is now).
