You may want to justify the above (convincingly) or step outside... =P

Human mages have two distinct advantages over other races: Best starting
faction everywhere (as long as you pick agnostic as your religion), and
best looks overall (more rugged than the fancypants High Elves, not
freakish like Dark Elves, and unlikely to be mistaken for a football
like a gnome). Erudites are okey too, except for the fact that they need
more faction work than plain vanilla humans.
