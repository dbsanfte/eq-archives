This is why Panic animal is the worst thing to ever happen to the class.

OK as a ranger getting agro should never... ever be a problem. I can lock
agro down through heals nukes dots and more using 2 9th level spells.
Tangling weeds and Flamelick. They are both uber fast and low mana cost.
Snare is good as well once you have agro locked down or if you have time to
cast on inc becuase its a butt load of agro and will also stop runners.
But Tangling Weed rules for a taunt half second cast time and pisses the
hell out of the mobs. Don't matter if it sticks or not (won't overwrite
snare or ensnare ok at least not ensnare. not sure about snare) it pisses em
off.
Flamelick was the old standby and is still good for when you are
specifically tanking. AC debuffs tend to be bigg tuants. Even little baby
ones like FL.
As far as weapon load out goes. Well I sugest you get all your skills up
while its not going to be too painful and keep them all maxed as you level
up. 2 handers are the way to go for tanking. When you move on to pop the
mega Riposte's those mobs do makes tanking with two weapons extremely mana
intensive.

For example while duoing larvae in PoV last night with my 2hb I could pretty
much malo slow then cripple and can a couple times  with my shammy before
having to start a heal. When my ranger was dual weilding (just for fun to
see how dps changed) I'd pretty much have to start the heal right after slow
landed and be ready to start casting again right after.

It's definitely noticeable. Now admitedly I"m fighting far harder hitting
mobs but I also have alot more hit points so it will scale to some degree

At your level getting agro should never be a problem. Getting rid of it can
be but gaining should never be.

Here's how you should do it. Puller calls inc. Choose which ever target you
want while its running in. and if you have time before it reaches you (IOW
its got a long enough visable run) cast snare that will slow its ass down
and build up a huge hunk of agro right off the bat. Next cast a FL and a TW
at that point you should have pretty solid agro. If for any reason they
start to turn from you just TW them again and they will be right back on ye.
I've used it like a yoyo before. DUmb assed wizzy overburns .. mob starts
hightailing it after him... TW half second later mob running right back at
me.

Thats it tank away
