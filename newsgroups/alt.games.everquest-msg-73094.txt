Sullon Zek is alignment-based, not race-based. The team of which you are a
part depends on the god you selsct(Agnostic is not an option there).

Without going into Sullon's intricacies, let it be sufficient to say that
Sullon Zek is the new butt-end of Everquest. Most of the grief-playing
exploiting jerkoffs from the other PvP servers went there(and remain there)
solely becaue there are essentially no rules, and because they can make
others lose experience by PKing them. And from what I'm told(and from my own
experience there) that's exactly what they do 24/7.

If you want to try PvP, try Rallos, Tallon or Vallon Zek.
