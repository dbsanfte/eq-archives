This may or may not answer your stated question, sorry.  It got too long and
I started to fade. :)

In order for you to have a raid capable guild you're going to eventually
(and soon) have someone in your guild willing to be raid leader and take
that role seriously.

Everything in this game that your guild is likely to ever do has been done.
Strategies can be found in many places or you can ask here or on your
server's message board, so that a newbie raid leader has the resources to
lead a raid even if they've only visited the place once as a participant.

After 7 months in existence my guild has decided that "if you want a raid,
lead it," doesn't work.  People fart around doing their own thing then leave
for greener pastures when they decide they want to raid.  We've (the
leaders) stepped up to the plate to become raid leaders, though I'm not at
ALL happy about it.  I think that someone (or 2 or 3) in your guild is going
to have to make the sacrifice.
