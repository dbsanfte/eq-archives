While this is true, it's also true for just about every other game
I've ever had fun in.  I get pissed off when I lose a CTF game in Halo
2 because they snuck the flag into our base under our nose.  I get
pissed off in ESPN NFL 2K5 when, after gambling on a blitz the other
team torches me with a deep pass.  I remember slamming down the Atari
5200 controller in frustration after falling inches short of reaching
the finish line in Pole Position.

The point is that I find challenging games more fun.  These obstacles
thrown in our way are there to make overcoming them that much more
enjoyable.  I believe this was a cornerstone of "The Vision" that
Verant used to get made fun of over - but it worked.  People kept
coming back, and we had a helluva lot of fun.

I too sometimes worry that they're making EQ1 "too easy".  But I've
been out of the game so I can't really say (yet).  When I started
playing, level 50 was an impossibly long way away.  Even level 10 felt
like an accomplishment back then (at least to me).  In fact I resigned
myself to the fact that I would never see 50 (eventually I did, long
after most others, and it was sweet).

What would be the fun of going into Blackburrow in the first place if
there was no chance of getting into trouble?  It was my favorite zone
of those early days because it was chaotic and dangerous.  It was also
where I learned how to group and cooperate with others.
