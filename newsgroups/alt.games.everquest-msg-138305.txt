DE's in the house pop exactly on the nose 8 hours (RL time)
after they're killed.  If the house is cleared, they pop in
random order...if only one is killed, that same one will
re-pop in 8 hours (like, for instance, the Coercer ;-)  ).

They stay up until killed reguardless of time-of-day in
game.  The daytime "guards" are laughable level 10ish
skeletons and level 15ish ghouls and zombies.  At 8 pm
the "guards" despawn, to be replaced at 9pm (all in game
time) with level 35ish undead guards...and the guards
are on the same respawn timer, so kill the low level
undead closer to 8 pm if it looks like the raid might
drag out..it's possible to keep the higher level undead from
spawning more than once by doing that.
