I set up port triggering, according to directions from LinkSys
support, and it did not help, but the port range you list here is not
the same port range they gave me......I will try yours and see if this
helps.    BTW -  If anyone with a linksys cannot get the config panels
to come up within the main configurator, make sure you dont have
pop-up stopper running...duhhhh. Took me awhile to figure that one
out.
