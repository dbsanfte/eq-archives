arakai,
don't sweat the non-leveling aspect, enjoy the game
i too have been playing quite a while, one char at 42, 2 at 20, and a bunch
of teens scattered here and there
as long as you are having fun, you doing the game right
and as to the wondering wether your the problem, i too have had the same
doubts, cured by the occaisional "man, you the best shaman i have ever
grouped with" comments
chin up, keep having fun, the levels come
