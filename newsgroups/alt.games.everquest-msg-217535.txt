There was no solo xp nerf in POP.

All of POP was nerfed for all size groups.

However, groups did get a boost to xp simultaneous with the POP
xp nerf, and they -claimed- that it was a solo nerf; the facts
are slightly different, although the effect is similar: Soloers
get less exp in POP but groups get closer to what they used to
get; funny thing is, OUTSIDE PoP the groups get a big boost, but
in PoP their bonus has less net effect, because the zones
themselves were xp nerfed, supposedly directed at soloers...
