Agreed on that one. My level 49 cleric got preferrential treatment to a
level 52 cleric on a hate raid just on this issue: They knew I did what was
requested, no question asked. The other cleric in question, was spamming the
zone, when they specifically asked him not to. And later on, I got asked on
more and more raids, as they knew I knew how to play my cleric :o)

Solitude :o)
