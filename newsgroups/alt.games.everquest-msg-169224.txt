My husband and I are 58 (ranger here).  We've found we can, when we are
prepared, take on mobs that quad for 250 (with me tanking, that is), but
we don't like to do it too often.  He got the almost-complete heal from
the clerics, but he doesn't have the rez, so we don't take too many
chances. I hear that 300+ hitting mobs is the norm for PoP...I dunno, even
with my obssession for ac/hp gear I'm still not meant for that kind of
tanking.  I could be wrong though...since hitting 58 our effectiveness has
surprised me at times.

Anyhow...usually on these mobs I get the oh-so-glorious job of keeping
root up after JBB nukes and poison dots. <grin>

Didn't you say you mostly root/rot though?  It's good to know that that
tactic works, at least.  Doesn't leave much work for the ranger to do, but
if he doesn't mind me sucking up his xp, I won't complain.
