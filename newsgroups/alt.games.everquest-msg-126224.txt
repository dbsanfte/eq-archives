NWN is great isn't it :-). I can't stop playing it hehehe.

They have never "officially" deleted any inactive characters. There is
a really good chance that yours are still there. It's not a "sure"
thing, but it is a safe bet.

>I had a 26 Enchanter on Nameless ( I know, not really high level, but many hours for me).

Your best bet is to head over to eq.castersrealm.com and look over the
Enchanter section. Read up on the spells (many new ones have been
added over the last 1.5 years.), and read through the strategy
section. That will give you a good starting point, for how the game is
played today.

My advice would be to jump in and have fun.

Also, make sure you have DX8.1 installed and the latest drivers for
your video card. EQ requires a lot more horsepower to run today than
it did 1.5 years ago.
