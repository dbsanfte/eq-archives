}True, you *could* do 1000s of level 20 adventures buy the big dealie,

}hardly an abuse due to its extreme inefficiency.

But that's just the thing:  You -can't- do thousands of level 20 
adventures.  Doing the adventure gets you enough experience to go up 1/4 
to 1/2 a level generally.  So you can do 4.  And they get you about 4 
points total, if you do all 4.  So by level 30 if you did nothing but 
LDoN, you might have as much as 40-50 points!  And that's if you're really 
good and never fail.  as you go up, exp slows down a bit and number of 
points awarded increases, so you might bave a couple hundred points by 
level 40.  You probably wouldn't get anywhere near 1450 points without 
hitting level 50.  So if you worked at it carefully, and there weren't 
level limits, you could potentially earn -one- piece of semi-uber gear a 
bit too early.  Which hardly strikes me as unbalancing.

It also hardly strikes me as worthwhile doing LDoN at levels under 50 or 
so, but that's the only place you can reliably get groups anymore.  sigh.
