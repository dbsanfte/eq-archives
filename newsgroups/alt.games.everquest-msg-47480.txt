Unless you are haveing hard drive problems I would copy the Eq directory to
the root of C: then from the dos prompt do a deltree *. answer yes to all
directories except EQ. this will take a while next del *.* to delete all
files in the root of C: then reinstall windows. Eq is totally sellf
contained and you will not have to reinstall Everquest and do all the
patches, Eq will run from the root all you will have to do is create a
short-cut.
