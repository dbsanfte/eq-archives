A few developers have left, havent really heard anything about programmers.
Either way, the developers that left said they basically wanted to do
something new, if they stayed at Verant they'd be pokin at EQ for the next
however many years, and thats *boring*. Programmers leave all sorts of
gaming companies all the time, you usually dont hear about it, programmers
dont have a very high-profile job. Turnover rate for game programming is
relatively high, throughout the industry. Verant Customer Service has always
been a little goofy, but its actually been getting better, not worse, in my
opinion. Its always been hard to get helkp in a chatroom, the GMs there cant
do very much, especially with all the 12 year olds spamming "PLS I NEED TO
FIND MY COPRSE! THX!" And, theres not nearly enough bugs in Luclin, people
need to stop going up there so I can have it to myself. :)
