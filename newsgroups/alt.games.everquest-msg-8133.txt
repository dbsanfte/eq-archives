Correct, except that it's not quite "all" -- it doesn't increase
"BroodOfKotiz" faction standing, which is the Iksar necromancers.
To get in good with them, you'll have to kill lots of
Iksar bandits/outcasts/brigands/etc.

Lots and lots and lots of them...

But you can get around most of Cabilis without running into the
Necromancers, as long as you watch your step.


>A small increase.
>A very small increase.

Oooh, yeah.

Or more accurately, the amount of faction standing you have to raise
is huge, since a non-Iksar will start out very KoS to them.

>become non-KOS to all Iksar factions.

Actually, closer to 8000...

2000 *quest completions* (not bone chips) will take you from your
base Cabilis faction standings to maxed (no faction standing can
exceed +2000 over your base).  The question is how low is your base,
and where +2000 will get you.  My Dwarf Paladin was so KoS with the
Troopers (on the LegionOfCabilis faction group) that the full +2000
(done via killing sarnaks/goblins) only brought him up to
"Indifferent".  Luckily, that's good enough.

Now we'll see just how bad my other Cabilis factions were, and
how many bone chip quest completions it'll take to get any
useful faction standing...

So it'll take close to 2000 quest completions to dig yourself out
of your non-Iksar faction hole, and that's 8,000 bone chips (since
it's 4 chips per quest completion).


>You have to become non-KOS to him first, but that's easy.  He's on
>LegionOfCabilis faction.  Just kill sarnaks.  Lots and lots of sarnaks.

And/or (Kunark) Goblins.  I did mostly goblins.

...interestingly enough, they're on different faction groups from each other,
too.  I'm now "Threatening" with Crusader Bodli, but still "Scowls" with
Crusader Quarg.  Go figure...

I suspect one of them is on CabilisResidents faction, since I doubt
that a Shadowknight crusader would be on either the Shaman faction group,
or the Monk faction group, which are the only other possibilities.


> and will still hate you.

Yup.  They've killed me twice.  My fully buffed level 51 Paladin didn't
last 10 seconds in either case, so be careful.

On the other hand, after I was Harmtouched by the Crusaders, I was
actually finished off by Trooper Mozo the first time (I was standing
right next to him when the Crusader sounded the "dwarf alert", and
Trooper Mozo pitched in to help because he's linked to the Crusaders),
and Warlord Zyzz the second time (I was running under his balcony at
the time I was spotted, and he leapt down upon me to finish me off).

I've found that you can do it relatively safely via this method:

Sneak up to the city walls by running along the north edge of the
city "pavement", high up on the grassy "valley wall" that flanks it.
Then run down along the city wall until you're at the section of
wall that juts out from the side of the city gate, then hug that
piece as you slide up to the city wall itself (on the same side
of the "jut" as the city gate).

You'll now be very close to Trooper Mozo, who stands at the northern
corner of the city gate.

Now, with the stone "jut" at your back, facing Trooper Mozo, step
carefully forward until you can JUST manage to hand him bone chips
without getting the "you are too far away from XX to trade" message.

Congratulations, you are in a safe spot, far enough away from the
gate's "centerline" where the Crusaders march in and out of the
gate when they patrol.  They'll look like they're close enough to
see you and aggro on you, and your heart will stop several times,
but you're actually far enough away that they won't bother you.

You can then exit the vicinity by reversing your steps.

I've done this countless times now, and never been aggroed at all.

HOWEVER...  The only warning is that when Crusader Bodli marches
out of the gate to go patroling, he comes straight out the middle
of the gate, and then turns left (north) to march up to the base
of the "valley wall" before turning right and patrolling the
edge of the "pavement" before he goes back into the ruins to
hang out there for a while.  And this path means that you'll
run smack into him head-on if you just run down off the valley
wall and towards the gate when he happens to be starting out.

So it's best to either sit up on the valley wall until you see
him move out and leave your "run in" path, or spot him elsewhere
in the ruins first before you run in (you'll have many minutes
before he hits the danger path if you see him anywhere other
than already on the danger path, or inside the city gate taking
a break).

If you're serious about this, it's a good idea to start an Iksar
newbie and use him as a spy to watch the two Crusaders (especially
Bodli) make their rounds once or twice, so that you'll better
understand their rounds.


>It's a quest that requires some dedication.

Very, very, very true.  But I'm a stubborn bastard, and I've come too
far to give it up now.  I'm almost there -- or so I keep telling
myself.
