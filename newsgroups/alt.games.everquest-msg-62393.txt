I hate that keyboard...absolutely detest it.  Damned diagonals always
getting in the way and damned macro programming.  We had 2 here and I
pitched them just as soon as I could get away with it.  I hated the diagonal
keys personally, but professionally I hated having to teach people how to
fix it after they inadvertantly reprogrammed the enter key (or any of the
other keys) to do something weird. :p
