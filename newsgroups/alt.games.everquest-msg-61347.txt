    I use extra words from spells I have to raise skill. At lower level, the
combines raise skill rather quickly. The pattern seems to be that spells
trivial one level or two above the next spell level, but I haven't tested it
deeply. There was a gnome necro on EQTraders that was compiling a trivial
list for necro spells - might be interesting to look up his table.

    They were trivial, then.

    They weren't trivial, but since you capped your skill at the trainer you
won't gain any skill-ups from doing the combines. I'd save some Words for
the level 20 spells after you're done, and when you ding 21 do some more
combines. You should be able to get more points in Research without having
to spend points at the trainer.

    Try shopping in High Keep. You'll be pleasantly surprised.
