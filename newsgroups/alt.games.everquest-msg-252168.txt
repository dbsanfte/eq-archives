The point is: It doesn't actually matter. Even one guy driving 8 cars 
isn't going to get from point A to B any faster.

Of course they were. And those 8 cpu's attacked 8 different problems, 
and then combined the subresults for a greater result. If your objective 
is to pick up milk at one store, eggs at another, and buns at a 3rd... 
three cars can do all three trips at the same time, and it gets done 3 
times as fast as it would be if you had to make 3 trips with one car.

However, EQ emulation isn't like this. Its a single trip from A to B. 1 
car. 2 cars doesn't get you any improvement, and adding more cars to the 
project accomplishes nothing. There is no way to take an x86 emulator 
and break it into 64 different sub problems to be simultaneously handled 
by a cabinet full of cpus.

But that's all done server side. EQ client sends mouse and keyboard 
commands to the server, accepts model and state updates back from the 
server, and draws them. Now, in theory you could split those tasks onto 
different cpus... up to a total of 3... but even *that* isn't the problem.

The problem is emulating the existing EQ client. You'll be lucky to get 
2 CPUs worth of parallel application out of that task... VERY LUCKY.
