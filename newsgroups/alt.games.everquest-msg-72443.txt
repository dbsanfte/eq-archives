I have a 48th level cleric, and have learned both how important and how
expensive buffing can be.  I think you are both ignoring a simple fact.  If
anyone in the group doesn't like the looting rules, they can leave. Or the
cleric can refuse to cast symbols on people who refuse to reimburse him.
I've done both.  A group should agree on the rules and stick to it.  If you
don't like the rules, say something.  I do (and I've gotten grief for it,
but that's the price you sometimes have to pay for grouping with idiots).
If you don't get something you consider fair, quit.

It doesn't sound like anyone even talked to the cleric to find out what he
considered fair.  As a cleric, if I'm grouping with the same people all the
time, I don't expect to get back my cost every time we group.  But I do
expect to not have to bankrupt myself.  In fact, I'd either stop casting
symbols, or I'd seriously consider joining a group that appreciated me.
I've had to quit pickup groups where I didnt' like the loot rules.  If
didn't think I was being treated fairly,

Note that if you don't want the cleric to get all the gems, then have the
group buy his peridots for him.  A regular group that I play with does that,
and I'm perfectly happy with that.  Just because there is an 'unspoken rule'
doesn't mean you have to keep it unspoken and not discuss it.  If you are
unhappy and not discussing it then it sounds like you have a dysfunctional
group.  It's not the clerics fault if he's happy with the situation.  It's
your fault because you aren't and not trying to come up with a solution.
Rules are flexible because they are palyer-made, and are good only so long
as everyone in your group agrees to abide by them.  Don't like them?  Change
them.  Who cares if 'everyone does it this way'.  But no one likes an
accountant in the group.  So just make sure that everyone is happy and don't
sweat the little things..

Pickup groups, of course, are different.  In a pickup group, if you don't
like the looting arrangements, leave.  I've done that when a cleric/necro
only spell dropped that I needed (and no necro in group) and person who
looted it insisted that we should roll on it because, quote, "NBG is only
for guild groups, and besides, spells can sell for over 1k".  Gee.  It was a
dinky Improved Invis to Undead spell that he'd be lucky to get 50pp for.  So
I disbanded.  Right before the puller called incoming.  Honestly I did stay
long enough to keep the puller alive, but gated out as soon as I saw that
was assured, though most people I've told the story to say I shouldn't have
bothered.

I don't care how hard it is to find a pickup group, the grief isn't worth
it.                              -Graham
