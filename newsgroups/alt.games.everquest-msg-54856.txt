Is damage done a function of ac at all? If so then that would rather
explain it.

I keep taunt over on a combat slot and mouse click it in between spells

I still use it at 26 as one of my 3 pull methods, with bow and snare as
the other two. While the bow has a nice range with trueshots and range 150
arrows a LOT of people will steam in and take an arrowed mob of me, flame
lick puts a nice flare of fire around it, doesnt have the vertical limits
of a bow and starts damage (however minor it is) while I begin to kite it.
