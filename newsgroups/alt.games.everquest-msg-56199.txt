    Oh, I know. That's why I whacked the level one mercilessly - he had a
Velious-pattern tunic, so was likely a Test player. But the level two was
not visibly twinked, and could very well have been a player who logged on to
see what Test was about after trying a monster. You have to admit, if you're
level 1 or 2 having "a skeleton" come hunt you down is pretty much
inescapable death.

    Bah, grief the PC mobs. They were the ones moving about like they were
clueless - wait for one to engage a mob, and once his life gets low gank
him. Ooh, I feel like a real Zek player now!
