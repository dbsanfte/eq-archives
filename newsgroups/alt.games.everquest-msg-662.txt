I've heard that you can group with someone up to 1.5 times your level
and still gain xp. Thus, level 10 can group up to 15, level 20 can group
up to 30, level 30 with up to 45, etc.

This is in line with my own experience. A level 34 grouped with a 45 did 
get xp, but a 29 grouped with the 45 did not. I was also told by a level 
40 that he got xp when grouped with a level 60.

Yes, the xp per event (kill or whatever) is divided relative to
each player's total xp, not equally.
