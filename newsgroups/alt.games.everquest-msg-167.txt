It seems a lot of the lag problems have been coming from the isps, probably
due to the bad weather we have been having and the stress it has put on the
whole system.  Earlier this week the Bellsouth system had a lot of lag and
an eventual outage, but that is fixed now and things are working much
better.  Still, I have noticed that for the last couple of months the cold
has put a lot of pressure on the isps in the regions it hits, and suspect
this may be part of the answer.  Hopefully, this problem will sort itself
out soon and things will get back to something more like normal which means
there will be lag, that it will not be as severe as it has been lately.

Another thing that may be contributing to the problem is that with Christmas
and the opening of Velious there seems to be a large influx of new and
returning players and that of course puts a lot of stress on Verant's
servers.
