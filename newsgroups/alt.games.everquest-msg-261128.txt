Hmmmmmm.  So mebbe I'm not imagining things, after all.

On an EC crawl Tuesday night, I continually embarrassed myself by pulling multiples.  I'd
successfully pac a MOB, and get bum-rushed by everything else in the room.  I've never had
a problem with my technique until Tuesday night.  I wasn't doing anything that I haven't
done a zillion times before.

Interesting to hear that someone else was having a similar experience, in a completely
different, non-instanced zone.  I feel a little less embarrassed. :->

Best regards,
