Interesting.  You really don't see how "every time..." is completely
non-sensical in the context of a timeless existence?  And let us not
forget that "consequence" likewise presumes the context of time as
we know it...

Oh well, I am no longer attempting to advance my argument.  Trying
to discuss the implications of a timeless existence in a language
that is so thoroughly time-conscious is just too frustrating.
