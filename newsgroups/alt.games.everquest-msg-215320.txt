Then you obviously would not be in a guild with that type of system.  
There are very good reasons for doing things like that in serious raiding 
guilds.  In order to advance, the people who attend most raids need to 
have equipment upgrades.  If you show up once a month for a raid, 
advancing your equipment is not going to help the guild advance.  I am 
not in such a guild, and, I have no interest in that either.  I am in a 
casual raiding guild, everyone who is a full member can get in on drops 
that are upgrades for them, so long as they are at the raid where it 
dropped.  For me, that's the best type of system.
