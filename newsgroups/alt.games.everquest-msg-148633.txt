Yeah I hate this stupid policy. Character files do NOT take up
noticable amount of space on the amount of space they have on server
hard drives. And another thing, some games have the option to not pay
at all at first and get a free trial so they could get many many
newbie accounts of people who just log on and never play again. With
EQ you have to friggn buy the damn game then have a credit card or
game card just to get yourself a character. There is no reason for
this except for if people could leave for any amount of time and come
back they would get bored fast again because after you're in the high
levels of the game there's nothing to do but grind exp for AA bars and
get the best equipment you can. Anyway I hope you didn't lose anything
really valuable, if I were you I'd take a chance on DAoC or some other
MMORPG, I mean your characters are already gone so nothing is stopping
you from trying something new...
