mesmerize (4th i think) you will use this spell forever. Wizards can root
and nuke . Root costs alot gets resisted alot and breaks early alot.
Chanters mesmerize and nuke . Mesmerize costs very little , gets resisted
very little , and dosent break early without help, there is however no
chance of it lasting through a nuke :)

p.s you will be tanking for your pet not the other way around for a very
long time.
