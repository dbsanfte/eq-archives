I kind of doubt that. Its more likely that they just never return
since they only came to this group in the first place to sell a
character which was then sold. I don't think any ISP would give a crap
since selling a character in an everquest group is really not that big
a stretch. 

I've never seen an ISP who notifies a group a subscriber was banned
from that the person was banned due to stuff he posted in that group.
It would be kind of fun if they did, but they don't so we have no way
of knowing. If there is someway to know I'd like to hear about it ;)
