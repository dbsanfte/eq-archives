    It's not that bad, but yes, we're 3rd tank and about 8th DPS with zero
percieved utility. Don't pick SK if you're not into the darksided thing and
not up for a challenge that's almost completely let down by the reward. Our
best lifetap at 65 is still an 80/tick dot or a 400pt nuke that's still
almost 1/1 mana/hp. That's not a lot of mitigation for mobs that quad 800's.

    But look on the bright side, we're so freaking rare now that if you keep
skelly form up you're usually mistaken for a necro and invited to groups.
