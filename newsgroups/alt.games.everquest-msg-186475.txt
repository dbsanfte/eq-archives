It wouldn't really work, I'm afraid. Of course, you can save on 
bandwidth and servers by having fewer customers, but still, the one 
thing that makes an RPG appealing is lots of content (in this EQ is

time and money to develop. The only way to make back that money is to 
sell that content to as many people as you can.

Take a look at this, it's pretty interesting:
