Ouch, good luck with that.  I'm afraid I know next to nothing about laptop
video cards beyond what I've read before answering this post (i.e., I
assumed it was a laptop card but now I know for sure it is <g> ).

If you can find an EQCLIENT.INI file in your Everquest folder, open it up
and anywhere under the [Defaults] section add the line:
UseTNL=FALSE

I have a feeling that won't help any, but from what I've read in an old
article about the card, it doesn't support T&L so you might as well disable
it in the game.

If you've installed Luclin I'd recommend reinstalling EQ into a different
folder (so you don't lose anything) WITHOUT the "Shadows of Luclin"
expansion, if that's an option (that's when they added a lot of bells &
whistles, one of which may be causing you trouble).
