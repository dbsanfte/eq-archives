Yes :^)

There are a couple Perl compilers out there that
will collect all of the modules, runtime interp,
etc. and put them all into a single standalone
.exe file.  ActiveState (the main Perl distro for
Winbloze) offers one in their PerlDev Kit, but
they recently stopped giving free access to home
users on the last version of it.

Another third-party compiler is available from:
http://www.indigostar.com/perl2exe.htm

I've used this one before.  The only disadvantage
to the "demo" is that it puts a delay in exiting
your program with some spammage about being
unregistered.

> Oooh - I do have my win32 Perl book up on the bookshelf though.

Bah... the task the original poster wants to do
is so easily done with just the *very* basic core
Perl elements, there's no need to drag Win32 into
the mix (unless you want GUI crap).

Actually, if I were on my FreeBSD or Solaris box,
I'd do what he needs with just "grep -v"'s, but
I'm lazy too :^)
