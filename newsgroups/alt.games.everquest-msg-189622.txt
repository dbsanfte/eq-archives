Not a lot in my experience as a ranger - although in my case it wasnt fear
that sent him legging it around the zone but bad pathing.

I actually used root on the shammy and towed the king and his pet out
towards the cave bats (open space before that cavern) - Root the pet,
absorb the HT - butcher king, re root pet, tke shammy in other room, and
them blast pet with summoned specific DD.

You as a necro can do this sort of thing better than a ranger wiht your
pet
