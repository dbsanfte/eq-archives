Assuming indifferent is sufficient... or in the case of the charmer doing a
quest for himself, assuming Amiable is sufficient.

Sadly, I believe the tunare quest mobs fail to be animals, so that won't
help, it will have to be indifferent or nothing.

As a side question, do the thurg armor quests require higher than amiable
faction?  Would be nice for my bard to be able to do these while keeping his
"dubious to both giants and coldain" status
