Following up to a random post in the appropriate thread, so nothing's 
directed at anybody, cuz I'm too lazy to find the right post, but here 
goes. :)

Umm, another possible solution would be mobs on horses.  Then you could 
see which of the orcs you shouldn't aggro if you might have to run.

Which made me think:  Once they've got horse code, different non-flying 
mounts should be trivial to add.  So I expect it won't be too long before 
we see mobs on undead skeletal dragon lizards and what.  And I also got to 
thinking that, being a gnome, I'm going to end up riding some stupid 
little long-eared donkey, aren't I?  Can't I _pleeeease_ ride the cargo 
clockwork?  Pretty please?

And I can't wait to see what happens when a monk tries to practice his 
Psychotic Monkey Claw kick, or Feigns Death, on horseback.  Prolly knock 
the poor horse unconscious. :)
