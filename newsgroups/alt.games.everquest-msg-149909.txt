Yes. It is always easier to lower a faction than to raise it. When you kill something
I have found that in EQ the negative hit with the faction you killed is usually greater
that the positive hit you get to the opposing factions.

If you are just killing run of the mill dwarves you are going to be killing a long time.
Try and get a Dain raid together and get a few whacks in on him. Those
are bigger faction hits.

I found this chart a while ago and it seems pretty accurate for every faction
I have had to raise/lower.

   [Assuming "Indifferent" starts at an arbitrary 0]:
       -2800        (lowest)
        -751        ...scowls at you, ready to attack
    -750 to -501    ...glares at you threateningly
    -500 to -101    ...glowers at you dubiously
    -100 to   -1    ...looks your way apprehensively
       0 to   99    ...regards you indifferently
     100 to  499    ...judges you amiably
     500 to  749    ...kindly considers you
     750 to 1200    ...looks upon you warmly
        1200+       ...considers you an ally

The royal amor is made not looted. The shawl quests use trade skills.
