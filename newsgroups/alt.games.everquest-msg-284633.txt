Good luck with this - keep us posted how it's received and if you see any
change.

Bad start to a letter, IMO.  It's too generic a concept to work on directly,
and sounds like a rant more than a piece of useful advice.  I'd take the tack
"we can do far better if we're more careful about where and when raid DPS
should be focussed".

Setting up appropriate channels, and getting the membership to set audio
triggers and separate windows for different channels is definitely a
challenge, and it pays off bigtime.

Skip the justification.  Just mention a few specific wipes where this was
the cause.

The MA should ALWAYS be on the target that he wants people to "/assist RAID"
onto.  Do _NOT_ make either the main tank nor any offtank the MA.  If the MA
is going to have to switch targets (and doesn't want the rest of the raid to
switch too), he's not a good candidate for MA.  

It's still the case that people should be watching the raid instruction
channel for whether to be attacking or not.

The MA shouldn't switch to a target that's going to need mez.  Let the OT/CC
group(s) handle that.

>on himself, by engaging early you are interfering with that.

The MA shouldn't necessarily be building hate.  The MT does that.  For some
fights, they can be the same person.

>Why do we need the MA to get target lock?

Drop this section.  It's not true (unless you s/MA/MT/), and it's talking down
to the audience.

Definitely.  And the MA should have a specific message to the raid instruction
channel when he or she switches, to let everyone know to reassist.  Members
should have audio triggers set up for certain messages in this channel.

Yup.  Almost all communication and discipline problems I've ever seen (in EQ
or out) have shared fault among both the leaders and members.  If people
aren't doing the right thing, they either don't know, don't care, or can't
tell.  The first and third have to be addressed by being very clear at raid
time what's expected.  The second has to be handled personally, by looking at
logs and finding people who need a talking to, and if that fails they need to
be asked to find another guild.

This is a killer of discipline.  People are TRYING to do the right thing, and
if they don't trust it'll be called, they are forced to jump in.
