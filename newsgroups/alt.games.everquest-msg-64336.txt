LOL. and you use supernews! no wonder my posts didn't make it.

you guys obviously know nothing about usenet. the only way you
could control people is by having a moderated newsgroup.

so why don't you go and create your own lil moderated gay jerk circle
instead of trying to fool people that you have any ownership over this group.

it might be best if you learn some state control and ignore me, otherwise
it could start to turn nasty in here...

turtoni - heh heh heh.
