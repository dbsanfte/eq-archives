    There's a great deal of favourtism that can come into the last name
process. In certain high-level guilds on my server, last name changes are
frequent. One player was known for having a different one almost every week,
even taking the last name "Taiwan" once on a dare. If you really want the
name to be removed and never be replaced, petition to have your last name be
a blank character - " ". That's what GMs will frequently do with last name
offenders, as it denies the offender the ability to get another last name
after the first is zapped, so they DO know how to do it.
