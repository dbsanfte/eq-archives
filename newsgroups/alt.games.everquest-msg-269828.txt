Drag some underconned charmable mob to a lower level zone to farm, 
things like that. I don't see what the big deal is there though.. I can 
summon a level 55 pet in a 1-10 zone just fine...

You would have to have all charmable mobs in the global model file, 
making it huge beyond reason, or alternatly, lower the number of 
different mob base models fairly heavily. A final option would be change 
the way EQ loads models from statically to dynamically. Then you get the 
   SWG 'new model, let me load it, sec...<brrr>' effect.

That may not be his reason, but that is what springs to my mind
