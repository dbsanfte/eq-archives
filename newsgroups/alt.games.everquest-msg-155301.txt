>  Just curious, you wouldn't happen to play a Warrior would you?

Druid currently - Baby one at 25. Played Ranger, Shadowknight, Bard,
Beastlord, Magician, Monk, Shaman and Palidin to early 30's mostly. Only
high level playing has been on a necro. Not particularily fussed about high
level play as the fun quota decreases as the responsibility increases. I
spend most, nay, ALL my time goofing off, in other words...

From what I have heard and read of "top league" playing I couldn't be paid
by the hour to get involved in that sort of <un-fun>.
