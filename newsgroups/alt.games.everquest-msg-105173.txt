That's the perfect point.  Items like the soloist wand are usable at any
level, but ARE extremely rare...however, think of twinking in terms of
Powerleveling.  Its infinitely easier to powerlevel a melee then a caster.
I think the analogy is the same for both twinking and powerleveling...the
melee has a greater advantage by having having superior weapons/armor then
giving a caster superior weapons/armor
