I had taken my 26 Gnome Gnecro to SK to fight the hermit.
pulled him as like I always do, skelley is beating on him ,when out of
nowhere comes a wolf pup, starts chewing on my ass, pup is db to me.
get him down on hp's abit, then another wolf pup starts chomping on me.
make a long story short, can't get FD off and die.
WTF, is Sony trying to make it so you can solo anything anymore.
so what if the hermit is a gimp.even with the Tesh Gnolls going by ,that
agro on you.
they added 2 pups with the hermit. I would rather get exp on my own,
then by being pl'd by a group of higher ups
