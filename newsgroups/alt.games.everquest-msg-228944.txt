Play at the zoneline to Dulak then :)  Things on both side of this zoneline
should be dark blue at your level, (if I'm remembering correctly).  Of course
you run the risk of trains there but usually people are polite and announce
them.  There are alot of caster mobs in the harbor town so I'd bring along my
resistance gear.
Have the druid levitate, sow and invis you then make a mad run for it from the
lighthouse:)
My BF and I played there for many levels.... play at the Nadox zoneline *inside
the luggald temple* if someone is already playing at the Dulak zoneline.
The map at EQATLAS.COM is great to take along....
