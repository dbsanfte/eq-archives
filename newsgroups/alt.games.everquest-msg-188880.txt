Druids (I'm partial to wood elves here I think) are probably one of the 
easiest classes at low lvls.  Healing, snare, root, offensive spells, 
ac/hp buffs, run speed enhancement fairly early...  Good for while you're 
learning the interface and such.  You may find you like it enough to 
carry it to higher levels.  The only reason mine is leveled up is for the 
ports.  Going to get her to 44 so I don't have to run through Kael or bum 
a ride from someone else to get to WL or CS :P 

After you learn the interface and the basic game mechanics it'll make
playing new class/race combinations much more enjoyable.  

My favorite so far is my ranger.  Followed probably by my enchanter, then 
my rogue.  Paladin would also be a good class to start, the combination 
of tanking (being able to take damage) and healing is a good one. 

When it comes down to it, it's all about your personal preference.  We
can show you some of the high and low points of each class, but even a
class who hasn't seen the nerf bat in far too long
*cough*enchanters*cough* may just not strike that chord in you...
