That would be me.

And as a necro, who WANTS faction?  The whole thrill of it is slowly and  
ruthlessly destroying those who are not intelligent enough to worship 
the ground you walk on.  Sheesh.

Anyway, on a serious note, I managed just fine - Neriak for a couple 
levels until I could live through a few skeleton hits (this was before 
PoP, and EVERY time I made a run for EC, I'd run into dozens of 
skeletons - I think I'm a magnet ;p), then EC, which was a bit hairy 
once that stupid Jimble Woodentoe appeared - but I *think* that the high 
level guard who wanders through there, whose name I can't remember, was 
dubious to me, not KoS.  From there to Oasis, where the gypsies were 
again dubious, but I could just run to the merchants in SRo if I needed 
to sell, and I stocked up well on food or water whenever I shopped.  I 
know I've said it before, but I'll say it again - Oasis is rather sucky 
for grouping, but it's PERFECT for soloing.  Med on that rock next to 
the docks and you won't have to worry about trains.  Pull to the 
shoreline, and that stupid warping-near-water bug happens to warp them 
to THAT EXACT SPOT.  The only trouble I ever had was the occasional orc 
warping over from the highway and aggroing on me, but since they were 
always nearly dead anyway, it wasn't a problem.  Anyway.  From there 
onto HHK (hadn't discovered Paludal yet ;)) and there I *was* KoS but 
I'd had invis for ages, and if things got out of control, well, I had FD 
memmed.  And really, the only reason I went there was because I never 
did manage to get my early 20s research-only pet.  Once I hit 29 I left 
again, and went to SK and did gnolls, aviaks, and centaurs (who, 
contrary to what seems to be a popular belief, do NOT give faction 
hits).  The only KoS things that wandered by were the walking trees VERY 
rarely (again with the name blank ;p) - and, well heck, I'm a necro :D 
Die, druid tree, DIE! - and the stuff that's KoS to all - cyclops and 
such.  And pets are for taking the hits while you FD till the mean 
things kill your pet and go away ;p

I'm in OT now, not really enjoying it - rhinos run WAY too fast, even 
snared, and the other stuff runs WAY too slow, even unsnared, and tends 
to wander off and disappear until you don't want it there again ;p - but 
then I've been distracted by playing my cleric and ranger lately, as 
well as continuing to level my rogue, so I haven't tried a heck of a lot 
of other options.  I have this thread:

http://necro.eqclasses.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=7218

mostly saved to hard drive so when I *do* wander back to her, I'll have 
a lot of suggestions ready to go.
