Hey, just because he's clueless, you don't have to be mean!  There are
lots of folks out there who *don't* have a understanding of what goes
into making the magic magic.  People who haven't been networking
computers since 'high bandwidth' meant a 300 baud modem.

Try helping them to understand why the EQ pricing *is* reasonable, don't
just attack them for not understanding how the internet really works.

Otherwise all they hear is, "Again, you have no fucking clue blah blagh
blahty blah blah blagh."  And once they get to that point, it really
doesn't matter what you know, they're not listening.
