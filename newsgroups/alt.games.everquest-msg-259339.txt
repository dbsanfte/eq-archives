Yes, thats the one he quoted.


3) Group experience bonus increasing dramatically. We've been testing this
on the Test server for a few weeks, and some final tuning may be needed
before it is released. The goal is to dramatically improve the experience
gained by groups. The old group experience bonus ranged from 2% to 20% for a
6 person group. The new bonus will range from 20% to 80%. ** In addition,
the 6th person added to a group will not count when experience is divided.
This means that in a group of 5 the total experience is divided by 5 then
distributed to each member. A group of 6 will also only have the total
experience divided by 5 before it is distributed to each member**. Due to
this large increase in group experience, we will be reducing the experience
modifier given in Planes of Power zones. Those zones had a dramatic
experience bonus. These zone-specific experience changes are more than
offset by the increased group bonus.

is the patch list.   Let us know when you find where it was taken out.
