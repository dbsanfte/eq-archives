I am pointing out the fact that groups no longer need 16-Ench/20-Bards
for Breeze, when the healers/nukers can buy a KEI that lasts 2+ hours.
*THAT* my friend is BSt. Even Clarity (29-Enchanter/32-bard) cannot
hold a candle to KEI. When 80% of the player base is convinced that
Enchanters and Bards are only good for mana regen, and KEI is freely
available where does that leave lower Enchanters and Bards? If they
can't find groups, then the average EQ player will never get the
chance to see how much more the 2 classes have to offer.

Try reading my post again. I never said melee classes could use KEI. I
said they got screwed over because of it. (ie stuck LFG...Looking for
Group)

The only "downside" to playing a casting class is med time. Until KEI
was introduced most casters would group, because it was the most
efficient way to earn exp. This meant that Rogues, Warriors and Monks
could generally find a group in any busy zone. Now the pure melee
classes are getting screwed over by KEI. Casting classes that would
normally opt to group with them due to excessive down time medding can
solo much more efficiently.

You completely missed his point regarding how much (or how little) the
average player knows about overall game knowledge. It is the
cornerstone of this discussion.

>>Sad and scary....but true :)

>People with attitudes like yours are indeed scary

I didn't express an "attitude". I expressed an opinion based on my
personal observations regarding the use/abuse of KEI and how it
affects the interaction between the different classes in the game.
