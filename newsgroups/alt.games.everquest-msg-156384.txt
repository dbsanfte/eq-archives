	I think my attitude can be best summed up by a comment seen on
serverwide.eqtraders directed at whining over the new tradeskill AA:

	"If it was raining money you'd complain it was falling on your head."

	More zones to explore, more raid targets (= less crowding), more quests,
more goodies, even better transportation than the Nexus, great new spells and
AAs (at least for my class, and probably for the others)...and that's assuming
they're not delivering on their promises of non-hell level grinding and no
more THO-style targets (where you gnaw your arm off to survive)....

	...and people are complaining.
