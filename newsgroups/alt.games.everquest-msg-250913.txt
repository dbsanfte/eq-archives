Actually the primary reason to hate windows is that it is sloppy code.
Because it tried so hard to keep backwards compatability about 90% of the
operating system is junk code. It would be comparable to reading a car
owners manual the size of an encyclopedia, hmm that may date me if you have
never seen an encylopedia. It is something that should fit on a floppy disk
but instead came on a 3 cd set. It is a real ratbastard now to deal with low
level computer interaction. Basic programming was easily understandable back
in the days of dos and many of us learned then. It is no longer possible to
do that with the computer that sits on most peoples desk.

Microsoft trying so hard to be a monopoly is certainly a problem but I think
it is going to lose in the end with windows because the actual product is so
bad.
