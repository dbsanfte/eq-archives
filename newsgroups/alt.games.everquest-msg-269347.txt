With recoding of my hot buttons, this coding to identify playing characters 
got lost and I am unable to recreate coding that works.  I have tried   /who 
target,  /w target,  /who %t,   /w %t.  All get the result that the name is 
not in the zone, when obviously they are right in front of me targeted. 
What is wrong?
