Why not just play something else that you don't find boring, menial, 
irritating and insubstantial, something that you won't feel the need to 
to quit your job and friends to dedicate 'enough' time to? Something you 
won't accuse yourself of "ruining for yourself". 

Its a video game for crying out loud. If you weren't enjoying it play 
something else. You don't owe it shit.

Do you treat shirts you find itchy and uncomfortable the same way? 
Moaning about how you hated wearing it, but wandering about telling 
strangers that putting it into storage was one of the worst things 
you've done, that maybe, just maybe, if you'd just kept wearing it it 
would have gotten more comfortable...   Jeez... just buy a new shirt and 
get over it. Same with EQ.
