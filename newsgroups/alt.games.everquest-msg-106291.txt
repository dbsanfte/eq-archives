I don't know about int/wis not having anything to do with successful combos.
My int/wis is fairly low (no coments) we are talking less then 80 for both
of them and compared to my friend who is an int caster I seem to have a much
higher rate of failures, even when the item is trivialed.  But, then again I
might just have bad luck.....the world will never know.
