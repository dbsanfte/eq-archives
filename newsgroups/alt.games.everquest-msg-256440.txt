First off - do you have your pet foci yet?  If not, check out
www.magecompendium.com and look at the focus quests.  You can
buy the parts you can't solo yet in the bazaar.  I would get
the fire focus, buy a girdle of magikot and 2 fists of ixiblat
in the bazaar - summon up a fire pet and go to town.  The 
fire pet was my favorite pet of all of them.
