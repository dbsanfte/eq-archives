The real issue is, in my newbie opinion, that there are plenty of
spell slots available for combat situations.  Yes, 8 is plenty when
you're in the thick of combat.  No problem.

8 is too few when you're NOT in combat.  Forcing clerics, enchanters,
shamans, etc. to continually micro-manage their spell slots in order
to keep the buffs flowing between fights is annoying.

8 spell slots don't make the game more challenging or difficult, just
more annoying.  Again, in my newbie opinion.  I don't see how even
a slight increase to 10 would unbalance the game in the least.
