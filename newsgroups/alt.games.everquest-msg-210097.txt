I didn't worry about H2H at all.  The 1HB and the Pierce are easy, just keep
one in you off hand, or dual wield if you are not the only tank.  They'll go
up quick.  The 2HB is like mine was, and will take time.  Maybe you can
fight a mage friend's earth pet (don't hit too hard and have a lot of HP's).
