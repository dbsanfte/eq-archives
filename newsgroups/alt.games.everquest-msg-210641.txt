Just level. Pick a spot where there are other people to group with and the
monsters drop fine steel weapons or maybe stuff like bronze armor.

The spires in South Karana and Split Paw are good. Basement of High Hold
Keep is level appropriate for you too, but it isn't a fun place in my
experience.

Don't chose a zone where there is nothing but animals and monsters with
no/low loot. For instance, giant skeleton loot in Rathe Mountain sucks and
they hit hard. Only thing worth killing in NK are willowisps which will
generate plenty of pp but no experience at your level.

Explain to your group you are low on pp and they will most likely let you
overload on FS weapons. Everyone wants to ingratiate themselves to clerics
for when they need a rez.
