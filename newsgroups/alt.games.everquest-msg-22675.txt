That's a little naughty.... saying that I claimed,
"using the Dictionary "is the wrong tool " to define words or parts of
speech"

I said no such thing.

I said that you used the wrong tool to support your claim, and that is what
you did, and that is what DT is doing. The dictionary told you it was a noun
and you couldn't see any other use for it. You needed a different tool to
tell you how it could be used as an adjective.

I note that you have already agreed that a noun can be used as an adjective,
now all you have to do is explain the principle to DT, as I (and the
University of Calgary,) seem unable to.
