At the point I'm talking about there WAS no post-rubicite ;) The exp
penalties were put in *at the beginning of the game*. No Fear armour.

No Kunark.

No nothing.

Now, at that point what is a 'hiccup and you've levelled past it' stage
of the game was still a long hard level area... and the few AC difference
between banded and bronze was significant when the highest AC BP in the
game was 25ac (Enamelled black bp, as I recall).

My point is, the *small* changes in numbers given by racial abilities
at the time (or in plate vs chain armours, for example) were significant
percentage wise when all other variables were equally small - mob DPS,
hit point totals, etc, etc.
