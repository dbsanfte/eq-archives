Thank you, At last I finally find someone with a sense of humour other than
the usual politically correct morons that infest our planet. As far as
Xenophobia goes I plead not guilty but I have a memory and a grasp of
history. I remind you that it is only 60 years since the xenophobic Germans
and Japanese bought about the deaths of around 150 million people. These are
the same Germans that threw Jewish children from the tops of buildings so
that the SS could shoot them like clay pigeons. The same people who devised
more and more efficient methods of wholesale slaughter of their fellow man.
Remember the japanese tying down Allied soldiers above growing bamboo to
watch it grow throught theirs bodies whilst alive? And so on. Three men lead
three countries along this path but it was the millions of people in that
country that AGREED and followed. I reserve the right to regard these people
in the light of history.
