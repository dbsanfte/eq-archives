That hardly means you've established it is.

At any rate its not how I'd treat my friends. As a consultant its not 
how I'd treat my clients. Perhaps it helps that I don't have their 
credit card numbers on file to tempt myself with though. :) Because if I 
made an error like that I'd have to tack it onto the next invoice.

I'm not quitting EQ. I'm disagreeing with their policy of retroactively 
charging me for the price increase. I'm disputing their attempt at doing 
so without bothering to ask permission.

Its not a human being. Its not alive. It doesn't feel pain. It has no 
feelings or conscious. It merits moral and ethical treatment about as 
much as my keyboard.

There is nothing that lacks integrity about disputing a charge you did 
not explicitly authorize. You make it sound like a forgone conclusion 
that SOE is actually legally owed this money. I'm not even entirely 
convinced of THAT much. And I'm much less convinced that they have any 
legal standing at all to simply TAKE it.

I'm willing to discuss the matter with Sony, I've already said that I'm 
even willing to forgive their billing error and pay sony. But I am not 
willing to allow them to make that involving my funds on their own, and 
then help themselves to the difference without my explicit consent. 
There is nothing lacking integrity there.
