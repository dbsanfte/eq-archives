Which server?

The cue is to never, ever encourage them, and if you feel they're
pushing it, let them know. Minor advances are somewhat cute (heck, I
do stuff like /whistle at the occasional male character myself). More
extended advances get laughter and/or haughty, and I have only had two
approaches that disturbed me - the guy that mocked humping me while I
was in wolfform, and another guy that went to pee on me while in
treeform. I mean, I have a twisted sense of humor myself, but some
guys I'll never understand.

Never let them get away with it if it gets to the point of harassment.
If they bother you and won't stop even when asked, /petition if you
have to. And don't worry about offending someone who is ruining *your*
fun if it's necessary.

*hands Flamilaliseikallaar a /rude for further encounters*

As for the ones that only want to be charming and loving... just tell
them you're not interested. Heck, tell them you're spoken for if you
have to. One of my friends had to be explained in detail while I don't
roleplay love - he is a roleplayer, has a RL girlfriend and wanted one
in game, and couldn't understand that someone couldn't roleplay that
kind of feelings.
