If it's the room I'm thinking of, they are now used by GM's as
"waypoints".  The numbers are probably the locs of critical points in
the zone (GM's can port to specific locs, not just to zones like
guides do)  They are also handy to dump a troublesome player into
whilst the GM "talks" to them.  I got trapped in one in (as I recall)
Tox forest once.  Had to get a guide to port me out, as camping didn't
help in my case.
