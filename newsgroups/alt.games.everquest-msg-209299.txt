Shrug in my experiences, a slow that lands is relatively low agro.  My monk
has no problem gaining agro in a short timespan after the mob's been slowed,
and more often than not doesn't even get agro.

In Solro (where the protectors do admittedly have a big amt of hp) i can
slow at 99% and cast a disease dot (breath of ulthor), and the mob won't
even turn and look at my shaman. If i wait 30 seconds I can cast blood of
saryn too (HUGE agro, very fast poison dot) and again the shaman has no agro
unless i do something silly, like try and sit.

If its a mob who could kill my shaman on a slow resist (e.g tier 3 named+)
then I would start with Malos anyway
