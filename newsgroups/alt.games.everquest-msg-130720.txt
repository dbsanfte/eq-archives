Seems to be dubious in most places in Qeynos.  There are so many 
flipping places in there, it seems like.  Or maybe it's just me.  
Anyway, I ran around to *most* places and conned people once I was 
bound, and nobody kicked my ass, at least...

I'm still curious about the sewers, but as I still can't manage down 
there even *with* a map, and I don't exactly feel like sneak/hiding my 
way into complete "where the fuck am I?"ness, it may be awhile before I 
can confirm down there *g*

(Oh, plus I mistakenly turned in 2 rabid pelts and a couple dozen gnoll 
teeth before remembering, oops, I may NEED that faction...)

Ryou
(PS - is Innoruk-lovin' legal?)
