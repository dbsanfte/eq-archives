    I'm willing to admit that I probably didn't phrase the question as well
as I could have.  But the first line of my post was

/quote

 Eh, I don't know.  It all depends on the mobs in question.  Do the orange
con mobs give substantially less experience and loot that the blue con mobs
in EQlive?

/unquote


   I think that part of the problem is that I was trying to ask for a
comparison between the conning system of two different games.  The labels
the games use are similar, but can have different results in how the player
experiences certain aspects of the game. To throw in another example, City
of Heroes uses a con system very very similar to EQL, except that it tops
out at purple. (Ok.  There might be other minor variations.  I don't have
both of the color progressions memorized.  But for the most part, they are
the same.) I do know that in both games, it goes from grey < green < blue  
(Ooh, there's a variation!  No light blue in CoH!).  But I can tell you, a
blue in CoH is not the same animal as a dark blue in EQL. Most heroes can
sneeze on a blue and kill them (there are some exceptions, mainly with the
support type characters).  In CoH, some ATs can easily handle killing a
dozen yellow con mobs solo, all at the same time. My tanker can do this
very easily. In EQL, there would be many classes that would be eaten alive
in this sort of situation. 

The games are simply balanced differently in term of how a player has to
interact with the mobs of the various con colors.
 
  Ok.  I guess I could have made the original question clearer.  I'll try
again. 

  Do the orange con mobs in EQII give the equivalent loot and experience
that a player hunting light blue con mobs in EQLive could expect to
receive?  

   I would expect that it would be harder to kill an orange con mob in EQII
than a lt. blue mob in EQL. But that's immaterial to what I am asking.  The
part about the equivalent loot and experience, imo, is what determines how
solo friendly the game is.  So far we've had one answer, from Faledan, who
says that for the purposes of experience, the two are comparable.
