Ever since Velious threw a monkey wrench into the works, yes a warrior
can solo to 60.

Remember, Velious gave us the 60AC Chestplate of Fiery Might and 12/18
*DROPPABLE* 1HB sceptre of destruction.

Against old world (and still blue) mobs which were tuned for level
50's with crafted/indocite and pair of yaks, it's a no brainer.  One
of our guild warrior routinely breaks into the king spawn in LGuk to
farm for froggie crown.

He brings with him, one cobalt legs (invis to get past the green frogs
in UGuk), one CoFM, one primal 1H, one sceptre of destruction, and one
fungi tunic (to "touch off" his health between spawns).

My warrior twinkie can trivially kill blue old world mobs at level 53
and almost eliminate downtime with a fungi tunic (think of it like med
time for casters except instead of having to med after every kill, you
can plow through 2 or 3 blues and then "med" for full health).
