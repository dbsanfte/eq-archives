For some time there was a problem with assigning combat abilities to the
button bank on the right.  The ability would bind to the button, but the
name of the ability would not show up on the button. It would simply say
Ability 1 or Ability 2 etc... It seems that this has been corrected, however
those abilities that were previously assigned this way, still do not show
up, only new ones.  I know that I can simply assign them to the button bank
on the left, but I really don't want to do this.  I like having all my
combat buttons on the right.  It's just a lot easier and faster to get to
them. My biggest concern is getting Harm Touch properly labelled so I don't
accidentally use it. (I hate it when that happens, it's such a waste)

I was wondering if there was a way to completely reset ALL of my settings
for my character so that it would accept assigning those hotkeys as if they
had never been assigned before.  I tried removing the INI file for that
character, but it appeared to only reset the buttons to a previous setting,
but not completely reset them.

Also, I am a little confused about Bash vs. Slam.  I am playing a little
ogre SK (well little as in low level-she is really a big girl) and I guess I
started with Slam as a natural Ogre ability.  At 6th level I got Bash as an
SK.  I am using a two handed weapon, so it's telling me that I can't Bash.
I guess I need a shield for that.  But sometimes when I Bash it works as if
I was Slamming, and it even greys out my Slam hotkey on the left.

Oh, by the way, at 9th level an SK pet is PATHETIC! with a capital P for
PITIFUL! (just had to get that in)
