You can't run when you are stunned or rooted,  no matter how fast your
boots.  It is actually possible to die while using jboots.  The fact
that it would never happen to you not withstanding, the rules are made
for all players and some of them would and do die in such cases.

So no one has ever been distracted by their kids or the cat or a small
fire on the stove long enough to miss a turn on the ramp?  Especially
with sow?

exploit the heck out of it.
