I beg to differ... I have a good good friend who has a 60 cleric and HAD a
slew of other characters 3+ more level 60s a level 52 UBAR twinked
warrior... had his account hacked and ALL his characters deleted... only one
the GM undeleted was the level 60 cleric... and from what I understand that
was ONLY after HOURS on the phone by cleric... GM's aren't that eager to
undelete and if they are ya need to let my friend know how he can get his
stuff back :P
