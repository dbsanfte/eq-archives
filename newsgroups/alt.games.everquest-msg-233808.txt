Hi There

In order:

1) My 19th level rogue has maxed in piercing. Has 113 in dual wield and 
with 15 training points in it. I have got my 1hs slash to 43.

So I am afraid it is hard work and patience until you get you dual wield 
up you will not progress quickly. 9 of my last skill ups came as I went 
though level 17

2) I found any of the steep sided mountains or cliffs are great.

The ones in Butcherblock near the PoK book or near the Minotaurs cave in 
Steamfont sometimes gave me 3 skill ups in one attempt or up to 97 in 
damage.

But I am maxed out now so I need less bandages :)
