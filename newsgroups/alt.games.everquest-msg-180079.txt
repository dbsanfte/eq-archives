Well, I'd say things like this are a good example of why race should NOT
become an issue in Norrath.

Perhaps you should not jump to conclusions that make you angry without
first being certain what Darktyger meant. Perhaps, though I can't say for
certain, the post should be interpreted as "Asian/black/white/etc are 'sub
races' in the human race." Perhaps white was included in the etc. Darktyger
did not say "Asian/black/etc are 'sub races' of the white race." Yet that
was the meaning you automatically ascribed to it.
