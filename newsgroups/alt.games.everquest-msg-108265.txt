Yep, i did it for my lil dwarf pally with my 55 druid (when it was not
no drop yet) I was very nice and only did parts of it no one else was
doing, buffed for people telling me when the high hold stuff had
dropped (so they got the xp) etc. I was considering farming ghoulbanes
since it was kind of fun and hurt no one else, but only got the one
before the no drop change.

Yeah, its pretty cool really and very level appropriate.

Exactly. With the no drop tag, a quest AND the dropping mob there are
plenty of ways to get the thing while no one will bother camping the
mob unless they need the sword.

Yeah, its a VERY good fix to the problem. I kind of thought the NO
DROP tag was superfluous though and the quest alone was enough
to take up the slack and make sure more people could get it on their
own. Then people could still have the economy improving sellable
ghoulbane.
