As a 45th Season Beastlord (usually in DL) I just want to say I
experience the same kind of treatment in respect to getting any HP
buffs. I am expected to melee I should get buffs -- now I am not
complaining here, a simple Iron Skin, Diamond Skin, valor, or symbols,
either or I dont care but something that I can help the tank and not
lose 1/2 my life after I get hit a few times. I have religated myself
to simple pet cleric in some groups where there is no enchanter, and I
am the SOWer. So I just let my pet join in the melee until I get Full
Mana, and then I jump in. I've heard that the whole pet issue is
actually if the pet does 51% of the TOTAL GROUP damage then he gets a
share of the xp, if not 1%. Either way the group still gets xp. One
time I had a group insist my pet was taking all the xp, it just made
me laugh how these people think.
