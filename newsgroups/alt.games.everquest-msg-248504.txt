As others have answered, to chat with the NPCs you target one and
press 'h' to hail it.  If the NPC says something in [brackets] try
including the bracketed phrase (without the brackets) in your reply
to get the NPC to say more.

Many NPCs are happy to assign you quests.  The quests do mostly
involve slashing and bashing stuff, but it's no longer "aimlessly"
because you at least have a goal (collect 4 rat whiskers to bring
back to the exterminator, or whatever).  There are also NPCs with
non-combat quests, mostly involving finding certain other NPCs and
delivering stuff back and forth between them.  Some quests will
require other activities, such as trade skills; e.g., a quest might
require you collect or buy certain parts and then combine them in
a forge or sewing kit or some other trade skill container, which
in turn may require that you practice the relevant trade skill by
making easier items in order to get your skill high enough.

There's lots to do out there!
