So you think that somebody with limited time to play a game should be
forced to camp a spot for multiple hours during that time just to be
considered 'playing a game'?  There is a point where needing to go
through all the stuff to get to a point where you can keep going (like
getting keyed for zones, or waiting hours for a spawn) passes the
'playing a game' part and moves into the work part.  A lot of people
felt like that as crafters in SWG.

How does somebody wanting to go out and have fun fighting stuff with
friends equate to playing with a Barbie Doll?  You might know something
about 'killer fashion' as it were, but it sure doesn't seem to be the
same thing to me.
