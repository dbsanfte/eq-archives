It's a game, so what else would you call it? But I agree that it's more
of a chore than a joy. Silk farming is not something I would recommend
for a new player.

It also gives access to the Beastlord class, which I believe is unavailable
without Luclin, as well as including a significant graphical upgrade.
(And increase in system requirements, of course.)

PoP and Luclin work together in a lot of ways - without PoP, getting from
the newbie cities to the bazaar is much more time-consuming. But basically
I agree that the portal books are the main thing offered by PoP for
the newbie.

The Cartography feature can be remarkably useful. I always hated running
around, checking every blinkin' vendor, to find where to buy essential
supplies in a new city. The increase in available bank slots (that
somebody else mentioned) is pretty useless for newbies, as are most of the
other LoY features.

Otherwise, the main advantage to LoY is the various (froglok) newbie
quests and the guides. Being given some basic guidelines on banking and
such is potentially very useful, given that the tutorial is now
basically gone.

Whether this is worth an extra $20 or whatever is another question. :-)

Overall I pretty much agree; he can manage without the later expansions
for now, but will probably start feeling the lack in his mid-teens or 20s.

Mainly because he will be invited to group somewhere (eg. Paludal) and
won't be able to get there at all, or won't be able to get there quickly.
