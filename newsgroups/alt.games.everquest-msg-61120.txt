OK, others have said a bit - let me add a few shortcuts.  For Win98 right
click on desktop (NOT on an icon), left click on 'properties' (down the
bottom), left click on the 'settings' tab (far right).  Towards the bottom
right of thise window should be an 'Advanced button' - left click it.  Left
click the 'Adapter' tab (second from left) in the window that opens.  This
will give you video card specs.

On your desktop right click on 'My Computer', and then left click on
'properties'.  First page that shows up will tell you your current computer
make and your RAM.  Clicking on the next tab along ('Device Manger') will
give you a list of your devices.  Your graphics card should be under
'Display Adapters'.  Sound Card will be under 'Sound, Video, Game
controllers'.  Press the little addition sign to the left of such headings
to list the devices currently installed (I am overdoing this you may notice
:-) ).  To view its details left click on the desired device and left click
on the 'Properties' button.  The thing about doing it this way is it doesn't
give as much info as going to the specific device in Control Panel.

Or, as others have said, just go to 'Start > Run > type in 'dxdiag' and OK'
The first page that will (trust me, it will - if not then you're doing
something wrong :-) ) show up will have your computer specs including RAM
and current version of DirectX.  Clicking on your Display and Sound Tabs
will give you the details of each respectively.  This latter way by far is
the quickest and most informative way to do it.

Oh, and what is my job?  Software support consultant who frequently has to
get people to check their hardware configuration  :-).
