Have had a couple of people try to bind me at other locations, but the
message pops up basically saying I have a "protection."  No buffs on at all,
and I don't own much in the way of armor/weapons that should hinder it.

What kind of stuff could u have on to prevent the spell from working and are
there limitations on exactly where u can be bound (i.e. it failed at the
intersection of GF and Crushbone)??
