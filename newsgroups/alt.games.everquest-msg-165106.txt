well creator drops a 16 19 warior sword. And a 18 20 monk fist . Oddly
enough these easily come within 10% of each other in dammage when you take
into account aas.

The belief that monks vastly outdammage warriors is in error. The belief
that some players have immensely more powerfull gear than others is not.

I have this theory :) Uber guilds are mostly a closed system . We group with
our own guildmembers as often as possible while exping and if forced to go
to a pickup group we elect to group with other opposing uber guildmembers
instead of the common rabble :) This makes sense when you consider that a
single person with crappy gear can easily nerf a whole otherwise well
outfitted group.

Because monks where slightly underpowered to begin with they had a harder
time looking for groups in this closed system and had to settle for the
rabble. The rabble thus sees the abilities of uber monks far more often than
they see the abilities of uber warriors, rogues , sks , rangers , etc....
The rabble gets miffed at the abilities of uber gear and thus complains
about uber monks who they are seeing.

In other words following the logical chain . Monks got nerfed because they
where underpowered :p
