No, it's actually a very good analogy. Discussions I've had with individuals 
in the Microsoft Usability labs confirm the small samples of data that I 
observed during my own experiments at Usability Sciences Corp back in the 
90's when I was doing this kind of testing. Females in our testing were 
always more inclined to search through the printed manual for information 
while our male subjects did less so and more often asked for online sources. 
Part of this was perhaps related to differences in general technology 
awareness between the sexes (something that was probably more pronounced in 
the 90's then is true today), but I have no doubt that Remington's analogy 
also provides some of the explanation. As often is the case, there's 
generally some basis for this kind of cultural stereotype.

Now there is a poor analogy. The flashing VCR phenomenon illustrates a 
completely different phenomenon, one that applies to everyone, male or 
female, and it made the cover of Time Magazine because all of us could 
relate to the reality of ubiquitous technologies whose complexities have 
exceeded our ability or desire to understand them and put them to use. And 
in that, I wouldn't be surprised to find that if any kind of test were ever 
done to understand which would be the first sex to resort to a manual to 
find the answer, I bet you'd probably still find more females willing to 
crack the book while the male spent his time pushing buttons. There's your 
analogy.

All of this emphasis you keep placing on instructional value is irrelevant 
because if you read the *reasons* that people are responding to manuals in 
this thread alone (witness Charles Witney's ritual anecdote), manuals (and I 
would guess more so with game manuals) have far more than instructional 
value, they're another piece in the overall presentation of a product. My 
stated preference to have nice manuals and my belief that most gamers also 
like having nice manuals, has never been predicated on a belief that any of 
us prefer to learn how to play our games via them. You've missed the point 
completely.

> I'm not here to argue people's opinions.

And yet you take every opportunity to do so. My belief that other gamers, 
like any other software users, like having good manuals as a supplement to a 
good software product, is my opinion, my belief, nothing more. It was 
offered as part of my "waxing" on the nostalgic topic of game packaging over 
the years, and I took particular pains to state that I realized many of my 
views on these topics are *not* representative. My thoughts have been stated 
on the basis that I (and I believe other gamers) enjoy the contribution that 
a good manual makes to a game's overall presentation, yet you feel compelled 
to weigh in with your thesis on instructional utility. And now you attempt 
to disengage out of respect for other people's opinions while coming to the 
rescue of those poor folks who are forced to accept my claim to be their 
representative on the facts. Priceless!

Of course not. Have a nice day, too. Dude.
