It ranks up there with the EZboard thread I read yesterday, where
someone on EMarr was apologizing for trying to pass himself off as the
original owner of his ebay character to the guild he was trying to
join. Reason: he'd bought an ebay account on another server, had
admitted he wasn't original owner to a guild he was trying to join
there, and had been reported and banned. Reason trying to pass himself
off as original owner of the EMarr character was even more stupid than
usual: it was the alt of a VERY well known former uberguild officer...
