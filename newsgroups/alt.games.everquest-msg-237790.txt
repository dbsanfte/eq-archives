There are a lot of people who actually *do* say that sort of thing.
They say that everything is preset based on the motions of all the
elements of the universe, that there's no such thing as "free will",
and that we're having this discussion right now because it was built
into the universe that we would have this discussion right now.  They
further infer that if you could determine the *exact* motions of
everything involved in a particular event, you could guaranteed come
up with perfect predictions of what's going to happen.

I think they're nuts, myself.  But that's just because it's fated that
I think so.
