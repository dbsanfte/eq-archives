I am currently lvl 46 almost 47 with my mage. I hate penalty levels, they
just waste the xp. I would much rather take 3 deaths in hell lvl than one in
penalty level. I am at an easy to solo camp  but it still takes about 25
minutes to gain a blue bubble and I lose over 5 blues in one death. So you
do the math I can delevel fairly easily in post hell lvl.
Oh btw I have died a total of 14 times and only 4 of those times when
soloing. Longest no death streak 8 - 24 but those were easy levels. Second
longest streak 29 - 36. Hardest level so far was level 42, don't know why
but just couldn't seem to get thru it. It took 3 weeks to get thru 42 and
one week to get from 43 to where I am now which is 1/2 blue till I ding
47...go figure.

I think they should be larger. I've heard they used to be, is this true?
After all death is supposed to represent well..death but obviously you cant
have everybody who dies returning to level 1 but experince loss should be
greater imo. This would make the game more exciting and challenging. my
character isnt high level so forgive the above if exp loss is horrendous
post
30 but i currently lose a couple of blue and this musters no more than a
"Dang"
from me as it will take 20 minutes to recoup this, give or take.
On a side note: whats your record for staying alive? how long between
deaths?
personally mine is pitiful having died at least 4 or 5 times every level,
probably 1 or 2 rl hours when im doing something boring like farming bone
chips.
