No, he just covers up the fact that every one of his latest "Software
Assurance" deal is a scam.  His EULA is unbelievably obtuse, convoluted and
impossible to follow unless you spend a lot more than that $2000 per machine
you quoted.

Fact: if you buy a Dell (example) PC with Office on it, and trash it a
couple years later in order to build your own, you must buy the same
software again.
Fact: if a business bought 50 computers, 50 copies of all of Microsoft's
software and use the same license number on all installations, unless you
specifically have a license that allows you to do that you have violated
EULA and will probably be sued by BSA

I support the good things that Microsoft has done.  I detest and have utter
contempt for their bullshit bully tactics.  I'm sure others can cite their
own BS Bully Microsoft tactics as well...there's bound to be hundreds.
