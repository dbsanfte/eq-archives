Not really.
I would be ok but since I downloaded the game I don't have a manual
that is any good.
I have been checking out a number of sites trying to find the info I
need and getting a couple of pointers from a disc. board.
Once I learn the proper functions of the stuff on my screen and a
couple of other things I should be ok.
Most games that I have played I have a manual to use while playing or
I can read it at my leasuer and go over certain point when I need to.
But with this game I don't have that option and all the info is
scattered everywhere so when I want to go back to something I forget
where it was.
Plus I hate reading on line.
I am an old fashion paper in hand kind of person. (showing my age).
I have printed out some things but most web sites are not printer
friendly and that gets expensive.
I am suprised the local library doesn't have anything on eq.
They do for everything else.
If there is anyone in columbus ohio that wants to drop by and give me
a quick tutorial I would be greatfull.
Or send me a old user guide. hint hint.
