  Yes, this is correct.  Before 10, the cap is set at roughly 20
damage per hit (depending on strength you may be able to hit for a
little bit more, I think).  From 10-19, you're capped at about 29
damage per hit.  At 20, the cap comes off.  Depending on your class,
at higher levels you may get damage bonuses.
