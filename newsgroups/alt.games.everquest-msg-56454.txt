Problem is, you posted the truncated link. It's really
http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2619.topic&start=1&stop=20
(It's the EMarr flame board, anyway, so the Magister Website is
better)

And apparently, one of the reasons they did it is that they'd done it
once before as Da`kor way back when the script was bugged, and Sleeper
had gotten reset. So, they wanted to be the ones to do it 'for real',
and counting who did it 5th, 6th, etc is slightly less meaningful.
