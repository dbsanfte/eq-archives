1. Are Necromancers KOS in BB, and if so, how can I raise faction so the guards
and vendors won't go after me? Someone told me Gnome Necros are, but what about
Human Necros?

If I'm not KOS, I still want to know what to do to raise faction there. Kill
Bandits and Orcs?

2. Can someone be bound at BB by another caster, or do you have to bind
yourself? (I'm only Level 9; don't get Bind Affinity until Level 12)
