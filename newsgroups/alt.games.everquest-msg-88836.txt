Thats not entirely correct.

Some mobs and zones don't like you dragging *any* corpses, regardless of
both your factions.

Temple of Veeshan is a perfect example of this, you can be ally CoV, and the
person your pulling ally CoV, and the second you pass a CoV mob you get agro
(which is why ONLY an fd class can pull corpses in ToV, and its a slow pain
in the ass), or even walk past the HoT door (with it closed) pulling the
corpse and they rush the room
