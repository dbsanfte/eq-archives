It has been, many many times.   They may have bored with it by now (how many
White Scales can you sell, before you've bought everything you want that can
be sold?)  Not exactly 4 wizards.  Generally it's 6 or so, with a puller.
Its happened to Gore, Sev, VS, repeatedly on E'ci.

It's not a guild.   It's Team Manaburn.   You don't need a guild to find 6
wizards with moderate amounts of AA willing to roll on and sell dragon loot
between themselves.

Go to the wizard chat channel on any server, and I bet you'll find at least
one such group.
