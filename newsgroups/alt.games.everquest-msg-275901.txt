    I'm in the padded cell with Biz on this one.

    I think the quintessential message of the informaiton age is that
mindspaces and relationships formed electronically can be every bit as real
and to us as those that involve physical contact. Often aren't, but can be.

    But you're not just turning your back on a place where you used to post
messages. Odds are you have some friends or at least sparring partners in
there that you don't see anywhere else, that you WONT see anywhere else once
you leave. It's not just bits and bytes, its virtual territory and it means
something more.

    Actually I think it would be quite relevant. A noob wont have as thick a
skin, won't know what someone can and can't do electronically, and wont know
what they can do.

    You seem to be taking this one a little personally.

    I guess that's what Biz just said. This place would be a crappy target
for that reason, and the ones he stated.

    Crazy fuckwits are not scary. Random acts of madness and violence cannot
hold a candle to a perfectly sane person with a Plan.
