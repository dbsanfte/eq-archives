Try the geos in CC, they drop pp and gems and the named ones drop chipped gems which
may sell for up to 144pp with decent cha.
I funded my IFS off these mostly, and I'm not even kos to them yet. If you clear the
8 of them soon enough you can nip down and look for the larger stalags which drop
stuff you can sell.
Sebilis is also not bad if you can get into a good group to do scarabs.
