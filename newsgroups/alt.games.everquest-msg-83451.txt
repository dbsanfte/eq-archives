Brad did leave for personal reasons, definatly not be cause he thought
that EQ was a dead duck. He still plays the game. (And post here
sometimes)

I for one am very glad that they did no research and generally ignore
the whineing masses. If they did listen then the game would a) never
have been made (as above) b) Be a whole crock of sh*t by now. So long as
the "vision" exists and is generally good the game will continue to
improve (it is still improving, believe it or not!) and have a large
share of the market.

If you don't like the game any more they feel free to leave.

I see no evidence that "DOAC (is) Spanking Everquest".
And even if DOAC does encourage the fly-by-night "leet" gamers to leave
EQ, well, tat can only be good for EQ, No ?
