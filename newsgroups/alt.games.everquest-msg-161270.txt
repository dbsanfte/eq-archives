Hi:

Last night I did a rather silly thing, I went AFK for a few moments in the
Grey, and the obvious happened, I had been killed when I'd returned - my
fault, no worries about this.

I then try to get to my body as I have a GM *event* item that has two (one
remaining) 96% rez's on it - but I died (again) trying to get my corpse. A
guild-mate then drags my two corpses to the zone-line to Mons for me, I
proceed to rez one of my corpses, all is fine, I get the exp back and
re-ding 60.

A guild-mate is coming (later) to rez my second corpse, and this happens
with 40 minutes remaining on the rez timer. However, I get NO exp back for
the second rez, and I've lost one full gold bubble in level 60, leaving me
barely hanging on to the level.

My question is: Has anyone ever had this happen, and more importantly is it
worth petitioning to a GM, as there wasn't one on (Stormhammer) at 02:00
which is when it happened.

Many thanks for your time as always ..

Stevie.
