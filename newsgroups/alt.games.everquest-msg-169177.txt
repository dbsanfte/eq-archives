    This was suggested by our leaders during the negotiation, and the GM
liked the idea. It helps get people through the trial and moved on to better
things.

    Ideally, we'd do these HoH trials once and never do them again. But
we're a guild of part-timers with wildly differing schedules. For example,
last night my guild bagged the dragon before I even got online, and a good
number of them went on to try Mith Marr. =/ It is in another guild's best
interest to flag us, because if they don't then we'll be killing the trials
they need and they'll be getting no flags and no loot.

Yummy

    Have you done the three rooms one? Three rooms, six of those
recuso-model mobs spawn in each room. When you clear a room, a named spawns
in that room. Clear all three rooms, the flag guy pops. The nameds in rooms
two and three each drop two items, always as far as I've seen. And those
items include 100 HP/MANA melee shoulders and 100 HP/mana ring (room two),
and stuff like the Gembladed Axe in room three.

    We're mostly a guild of adults that act like adults. It helps. =) Hey, I
even have a positive soulmark on my account!

    I imagine our reasoning to the GM sounded something like this: you
promised us the next dragon spawn (ignoring whether this was correct or
not), to either defeat and get flagged or be defeated. Because of a game
bug, neither happened. We would like what was promised to us, please.

    It's not like the other guilds lost sleep over this. One went and did
Carprin cycle, possibly becoming the second guild flagged for Bertox (I
didn't hear if they completed it successfully or not). One went to Vex Thal
for the phat lewts. And the final one, from /who-stalking them, did Behemoth
and Terris-Thule, and knowing them also Agnarr. Plenty of stuff to do these
days!

    I'll inform the player in question to petition to have his quest mob
moved there ASAP!
