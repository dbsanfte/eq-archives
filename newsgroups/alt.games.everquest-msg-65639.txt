Looking at the bottom of the SoL box now (and this is similar on all
the boxes)

System requirements - a column listing min, and a column listing
recommended...

following that, marked with an asterix, in print of the same size, is
a requirement for DX 8.0 or greater... and in the same sentence,

"System requirements subject to change as the game progresses"

pretty clear and obvious to me...  regardless of what it says it
currently supports.
