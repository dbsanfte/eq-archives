Last patch message they mentioned that the network code had been changed
slightly so that when you zone in a non moving player will not send data and
so you will not see them in the zone until they move. This has been like
this for some time, the change they made last patch was that as they had
freed up more bandwidth they then used it up by players sending more
updates. This hadn't bothered me at all after the patch but I haven't played
all week and logged on last night to find that running 2 or 3 accounts at
once was no longer possible on my connection :ï¿½( Ping remains fine, and for
the most part the Packet loss wasn't a problem but packet size was 1500 -
5000 with occasionally a huge amount of P/L. With one account on the figure
stays at around 500 but does exceed 1k often with 2 on it's laggy but you
can move about (wouldn't want to play like it) and 3 is just unusable.

Has anyone else found this a problem at all or noticed anything? I swapped
ISP's in the hope it was just them but it made no difference. My connection
is a single (64k) ISDN channel, I could channel bond and use 128k but then
I'd be paying for one of the calls and I'm not sure it'd make that much
difference. Obvious answer is (A)DSL as there is no cable in my area and I
am looking at this change, just to save me money (about 125 quid a month)
but this will take a few weeks.

I might be reduced to only playing when I can find a group again....ewww
