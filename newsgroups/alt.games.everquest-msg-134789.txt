Rubbish. We've built a socialist democracy here - a fair and just
cause I think. Other nations are only concerned with what *they* can
have, how much money they can get and how easily they can boss others
around.

Err, get your head out of your ass. Despite what they may tell you in 
school, nations which don't have "freedom of the people" type acts
are not necessarily totalitarian either. The UK doesn't even have
a constitution but the rights of all are guaranteed because of our 
socialist domocratic ideals.

And no, you're right, we don't have gun ranges. How well observed of
you. You can diss us all you want, but you must realise that we British
are not into guns - we don't use them, we don't need them. It is quite
obvious to anyone with half a brain that the US style gun system doesn't
work, despite you cries about personal protection. Personal protection
my ass - you just like shooting rabbits.

Hmm. Maybe. Until little Johnny finds said weapon and blows his head
off. How responsible is *that*, may I ask?

Not at all. It's all true, and you know it. You may think it's right,
but, well, you would. They're only Afghans. How many Afghan citizens did
your boys murder last year then? 800? 900? More? Still a crock?

Is that an insult?
