Maybe they thought, wow we'll give the most demoralising and expensive class
to play something to look forward to every 5 levels.
As a wizard, my next set of TL or port spells are greatly looked forward to
while im levelling. Take ports away from the wizard and it pretty much
becomes a crap class. They say we do the most damage but what good is a
500DD spell when it just gets us aggroed and beaten into a pulp. That leaves
us the option of just casting 100DD spells more frequently. In groups that
works fine but soloing for experience is pretty much useless. The downtime
is horrific!
Gaahhhhhhhhhhhh
Wizards are so frustrating
Give us those damn Familiars please!!!!!
