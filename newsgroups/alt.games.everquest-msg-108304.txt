which is what im arguing. My chanter and monk both solo better than my
druid. I know it really burns people when I say that but dangit your just
gonna have to live with it. I dont particualrly want to have to solo with
any of them , the only one who ever did was the druid. I know from
observation that many other classes can solo and do so better than the druid
as well and that those classes are far more welcome in groups as well. Why I
quit my druid. He does not have the utility to fit in a group most of the
time.

Even so if he actually had the gestalt effect of 70-80% of the other classes
abilities in everything else it probably would make him playable. He sure
dosent have it for healing having rather 16%. Easiest way to fix that is to
take the 16% healing up to around the 75% range and be done with it. Still
wont knock anyone out of groups or raiding , but will give them something to
do.
