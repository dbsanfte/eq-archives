A druid guildie of mine sent the guild a message asking if there were any 
quests worth doing.  I told him to get his Testament.  He had heard of it, 
but knew nothing about it.

I told him to go to HPH and directed him to the spot.  Told him it was a 
6.5 - 7 hour spawn or something like that.  Told him he would have to wait 
in line.

Pheh.  He gets there, and just a little bit later says "I killed Dyllin, 
now what?"

*shock*  Noone was there, noone popped in on him, and the red bandit didn't 
mess with him.  We directed him through the rest of the quest ( shoulda 
made him figure it out himself after getting so lucky ) and he now has his 
book.

Ported into S. Ro the other night right before logging.  "AC is Up!"  *doh*  
I take off north from the Wiz port, and someone shouts "where?"  "near the 
merchants!" *double-doh!*

They took him down pretty fast, those DE bitches.
