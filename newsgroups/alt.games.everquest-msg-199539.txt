It's not divided equally, well, unless all group members are the same 
level.  It is divided based on the levels of the players, not the amount of 
damage each inflicts.  If it were based on damage done, clerics would never 
level, they would always lag behind.  There are other factors to consider, 
different races have bonuses or penalties to xp, and those will affect how 
much apparent xp is recieved.  The other issue to consider is that there 
have been, and may still be, bugs with displaying the amount of xp you 
actually have.  I can honestly say I have never seen a difference in the xp 
I gain per kill that depended on whether or not I actually damaged a mob 
directly or not.  (excluding the old pet xp rules anyway).
