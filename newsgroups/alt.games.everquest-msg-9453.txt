Perhaps you're right, but there is a very good reason why everyone would be
responding that way.  The idea that a magician is the best partner _for_ the
paladin is ludicrous.  The best partner for _any_ tank is a healer.  I don't
see how a magician adds enough to the paladin to possibly compare to the
addition made by a shaman/druid/cleric.
