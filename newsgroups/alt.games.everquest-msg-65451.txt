Greetings all!
    Managed to get SOL installed last night and ran around some of the first
few zones for a couple of hours.  I went in with my 44th Level Warrior,
thinking to use him as an advanced scout, since he'd be in less danger of
being attacked and killed than would a newbie-kitty.  With that in mind I
headed out to look for potential prey.  Please forgive the butchered names,
as I'm going from memory.

    Went to Netherbian's lair - north of Nexus.  Seems mainly to be a
built-up hallway that can lead to two other zones: Marus Seru, and
Dawnshroud Peaks.  In the sides of the main Hallways are rough tunnels that
house the Netherbian, Fungoids, and Troglodytes.  The first two conned Ready
to attack, the third just dubious;  all were green. Since the Netherbian and
Fungoids wanted my blood, I took theirs.  No faction hits either way, and
anywhere from several gold to 4.5 plat when they did drop coin.  Mundane
loot like runes and tarasin grimoire page, and a "porous" block of stone?
Dunno yet.

In Marus Seru, lots of critters on the sand-blasted plains. Rhino beetles,
hoppers (look like velociraptors), Stonegrabbers (living rock formations)
were all green and indifferent or dubious.  No faction hits, and small coin.
One other criiter I saw out there was ready to attack, but i can't recall
its name; he was in a hurry to die though.

In Dawnshroud Peaks, took just a few steps out into the grassy area and
noticed that everything there conned blue to me, and wanted to kill me. Then
a wolf tried to oblige. Then my screen froze up. It had been doin this
periodically since I came to Luclin, but this was the first time I was under
attack when it did.  By the time the control came back the wolf had done
about 200 points of damage to me in three hits;  mind you I was already down
to half from just wandering and picking fights, and not resting to heal.
Discretion is the better part of saving my ass, so I left.  Went to the
Bazzar, and Shadow Haven, then camped.

I've got to be honest:  one of the reasons for getting into Luclin so soon
was the possibility of finding muffed-up loot tables. The generous coin
(IMO) from the Netherbian and Fungoids may be such.  They didn't seem to hit
for that much, though the Netherbian Warriors did seem to have a fair que of
hit points.

Anyone else have observations to share?
Thanks for your time,

Player of Valkir Sunderblood - Dwarf Warrior of 44 Campaigns
