if you have ever had to recover your corpse naked, you know a group well
organized with even one person clothed (the tank) is still viable.  We were
in seb, the rogue died, and we had to go thru about 6 critters to get our
stuff.

If you earned your stuff, then you definitely know where to go to replace
it.  The easiest way to get back to reasonable equipment would be to start
at the easy to kill stuff and work up in equipment.

I met someone who was doing just that, since he switched to a new server.
He had friends who gave him a few things, but he still was working from
pretty much scratch to build up.  You start with the things you can get
easily and work up.

Personally i could outfit myself extremely fast.  When i was around 20th I
actually thru everything in the bank and worked from scratch for awhile.
