Lull.  Cast on mob to reduce its aggro range so you can pull its buddy
away from it solo.

Doesn't sound bad does it?

Ah but it fails 75% of the time.

And unlike Harmony (the druid/ranger AOE version of this line) a fail
aggros its target.. and naturally the target and any of its buddies nearby

come a running.

If it succeded about 75% of the time, this would be worth risking.
If it failed like it does, but fails didn't aggro target, then it would be

very much worth using... clumsy compared to Harmony, but it
Does work indoors.

As it stands... I'd rather have voice graft.
