If the cleric preferred soloing, the recommended way for achieving that
without pissing people off is to respond "Sorry, not intersted."

The entire idea is ridiculous.  This is a game, not an employment contract
negotiation.    Should my warrior always respond to group tells with "Hmm...
so you're having trouble finding a tank?  Must be pretty desperate if you're
even asking a warrior.  What is it worth to you?"   Should group leaders be
having to negotiate with each member?  Perhaps pay them all out of thier own
pocket?  Is the person demanding extra not benefitting from the group in
some way?  If they're willing to heal from out of group so they don't share
in the experience reward, then sure, makes plenty of sense to pay them extra
in coin.
