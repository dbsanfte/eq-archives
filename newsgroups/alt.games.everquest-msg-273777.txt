Well yeah, at level 12 you're barely getting out of the starting towns and 
haven't made any real progress on your hallmark quests. And you have no 
Heritage quests, which are one of the primary manifestations of the EQ lore 
in EQ2.

Right, it's true of all these games that a different game emerges at level 
cap. EverQuest 1 was legendary as the game that didn't start until you hit 
level 65 so it's not surprising that WoW and EQ2 will also share some of 
this. A new game has to be available for those who've capped out, else there 
wouldn't be much to keep them there. Glad to hear you say that it won't 
always be this easy.

Hard for me to accept that last comment based on what I've seen so far, but 
the fact that you and I have different perceptions probably illustrates that 
there's more common ground here than either of us individually has 
experienced. My perception is that the quests are too simplistic and linear 
to be very satisfying and that makes it feel more like a grind to me. On the 
other hand, I do hear a lot of quest talk in the chat channel and very 
little talk about xp'ing and that does support what you're saying.

Yep, that's a key difference between these two games. EQ2 reflects SOE's 
bent toward grouping and despite all their claims to the contrary, the game 
is still largely group oriented with much less for the solo or small group 
player.

You know, when people say "raid" in EQ they have a very specific thing in 
mind, and it involves multiple groups taking on big uglies in hard-to-reach 
spots in search of great glory and loot. In WoW, 9 times out of 10, if 
someone says "Raid" they're talking about a bunch of PvP players running 
through town killing other players. This is the only use I've seen of the 
term so far. Where exactly are the EQ style raids in WoW?
