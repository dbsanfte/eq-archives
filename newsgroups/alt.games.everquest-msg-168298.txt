I've got the same as you, a vague idea.  Difference is, I don't see it
as an insurmountable problem.

Yes and no, of course.

?  Oookay, whatever.

2 groups of 6, engaged in combat:

1A versus 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 2E, 2F = 6 data sets.
1B versus 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 2E, 2F = 6 data sets.
1C versus 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 2E, 2F = 6 data sets.
1D versus 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 2E, 2F = 6 data sets.
1E versus 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 2E, 2F = 6 data sets.
1F versus 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 2E, 2F = 6 data sets.

Total, 36 data sets.  Now, if you were to add in "friendly fire"
combat, the data set count would be much higher.

The first soloer (of 5) would add in 12 more data sets (he attacks
every member of both groups).
The second soloer would add in 13 more data sets (he attacks every
member of both groups *and* soloer # 1).
The third soloer would add in 14 more data sets (he attacks every
member of both groups *and* soloer # 1 *and* soloer # 2).
The fourth soloer would add in 15 more data sets.
The fifth soloer would add in 16 more data sets.

Total then is 106 data sets, which require that EVERY person involved
hit EVERY enemy involved.  Frankly, I doubt that would ever happen
unless it was deliberately worked for (people walking up and hitting
each other person one time).

As for your 2, 4, 3, 3..., I have no idea what you're getting at.
Assuming all of the groups were attacking all of the other groups, and
every person hit *every* opponent in *all* of the other groups, you'd
have 43,200 data sets.

I am quite cognizant of the complexity.  I also believe that it can be
dealt with.

Problem is that this is an iterative problem.  Set up conditions,
test, refine, add conditions, test, refine, et cetera.  It is
impossible (as far as I can see) to do it perfectly in one take, which
seems to be what you want.  Plus, as I said before, there are lots of
other things that need to be taken into account; the example was just
a small one, after all.

For instance, possible solutions to griefers using throwaway
characters:

1) Only one character per account.  Generally unacceptable.
2) Give a faction hit to someone else, you can't interact with that
person for 24 RL hours.  Has different reasons for unacceptability.
3) "Tarred with the same brush".  All characters on any given account
get the faction hits.
4) Reduced form of (3).  All other characters get 1/2 of the faction
hit.

There are lots of other possibilities.  They'd have to be tested to
see what ones work best.
