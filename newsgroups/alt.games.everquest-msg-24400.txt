A 41 rogue should know enough aggro management to _never_ taunt a mob
off of another player, 'cept maybe an enchanter or cleric.  He could
outdamage
you 3-1 and if Evade works, never aggro the mob.  A warrior should have
a hard time outdamaging you, especially with average equipment and a maxxed
taunt skill.

As an aside, I went through 34 with a druid partner...I always tanked as
the rogue, except just long enough to evade and backstab.  Using aggro
as the damage meter wouldn't give an accurate picture.

If you're 4 levels above him, you should do more damage than him,
even if he's dropping good backstabs, that's still 4 levels worth of
offense/weapon skill you have on him, meaning more hits and more hits
for higher damage.  And for a rogue, equipment plays a HUGE part
of the "how much damage" game.  My level 59 rogue has been known
to drop his Ragebringer in favor of some less damaging weapons in an
exp grind, simply because the warriors and rangers couldn't keep up
with my aggro, and Evade wasn't working (or I wasn't working :-)  ).
Dropping the haste and the quality of the weapon makes a very
noticable difference in my damage output.

I remember going from an 8 dmg weapon at level 48 (SBD, when
they were "uber" ;-)  ) to a 10 damage weapon in Fear (Bone Razor)...
my entire guild said "damn" when I started hitting backstabs for an
extra 60 points or so, just from changing one weapon.
