Yep, I specifically went with SDSL instead of the more usual ADSL in order 
to get optimized upload speeds for gaming purposes. Unlike most Internet 
users who primarily download, I figured upload speed was more important to 
my gaming experience. How important, however, is an open question. That's 
why I'm looking for the reality behind the theory.

I've heard both sides of this argued vehemently, it's one of those arguments 
I don't know how to validate based on my own world experience, I have to 
rely on outside expertise and opinions. The most recent account I read was 
in Maximum PC, I believe, and their conclusion was that a dedicated DSL 
circuit does have an advantage. Come to think of it, I don't ever hear DSL 
users complain (and I myself have never complained) about erratic and wildly 
fluctuating pings. My ping changes from game to game of course, but is 
pretty uniform over time within any given game. I often wonder about people 
who wipe in a raid or die in Diablo or whatever, and claim "lag", and all 
this talk about lag spikes, while I'm looking around saying "Huh"? Maybe I'm 
witnessing a cable/DSL difference in practice. I have had on occasion 
temporary drops into yellow and red zones, but these are either so rare as 
to be hardly noticable, or occur in connection with some kind of obviously 
faltering -- and about to go down -- system, like a dying server that is 
having trouble keeping people connected. And in those cases the "lag" 
meter's actually probably reporting packet losses, not bad pings. And yet a 
poor ping (latency) would seem intuitively to me to be one result of the 
peak hour traffic phenomenon of the "shared" cable architecture. As a total 
bandwidth noob, I'd be very open to hearing fact-based arguments why this 
intuitive result isn't accurate. Seems to fit with my experience to date, 
and definitely with Leo's.

> The best advice you'll get is try them both, and pick the better one.

Yeah, I decided to go ahead and sign up for the cable service and since 
they're on completely different incoming pipes, I can leave my DSL up and 
running and set up some fairly rapid A/B tests and compare results. I wanted 
more input before eating the cable installation and modem charges, but, as 
you say below ...

That makes sense. I'll do some tests and report my results later. There used 
to be a site called DSLReports that I used to validate my relative up and 
down speeds, if it's still around I'll run some tests there with both DSL 
and cable, at different times of day, and see how they compare.
