Actually, I would bet that there is MORE bandwidth between Australia
and the US than there is between Australia and Korea.  I am quite
certain that there is more usable bandwidth between Australia/NZ and
the US than there is between Australia/NZ and Korea or Japan.

Absolutely, a huge number of Japanese, Korean, and Malasian internet
gamers speak English.  However, I would say that the percentage of
Australians (or people living in Australia) who speak English is as
high, if not higher, as the percentage of people who live in the US
who speak English.  Remember, not everyone who lives in the US speaks
English, in fact there are entire neighborhoods in most major US
citiers where the majority DON'T speak English.  

>(3) Plenty of Australians speak a language other than English

What makes you think that many Australians speak any Asian language?
From news reports in the US you would think that the average
Australian is a bigoted, anti-asian fasict.  OK, it's possible that
you're referring to the recent Australian immigrants from asian
countries, but unless I'm totally misreading the reports I've seen,
this is a very small segment of the population.

>Language practice, less lag and plenty of people to play EQ with.
>It's a great thing.

Not disagreeing just to be cantankerous (well, not tonight anyway),
but I haven't seen a lot of evidence that the Aussies are that
interested in language practice.  Hell, they still speak the language
of the bastards who sent their ancestors half-way around the world for
being poor!  I've been friends with a number of Aussies I've met over
the internet, and have met several of them in person (plus I lived
there for a year as a child), and I don't find them any more likely to
want to be on a generally Asian server as anyone else who isn't Asian.
I also don't find them wanting to be on a Russian, French, or Swahili
speaking server any more than anyone else who doesn't speak Russian,
French, or Swahili.
