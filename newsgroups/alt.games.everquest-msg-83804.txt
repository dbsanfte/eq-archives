Weeeeeellll, I did some "soloing" in BW near SF.  It's pretty easy,
especially if there's a mage in the zone (/ooc Trading head buffs for a 1hs
weapon or two, summoned is fine!).  I quoted "soloing" because my other
computer was on and my druid was snaring 'em to make fear kiting easier. :)
That's actually not required if you find a place where the pathing makes the
critter turn every time your pet hits him.

The tough part is doing 51% of the damage so your pet doesn't steal a decent
chunk of your xp.
