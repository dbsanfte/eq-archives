I disagree.  Perhaps if you were not a Paladin, but rather a
considered Multi Class (run on a system such as AD&D did/does) where
you were a Warrior/Cleric and advanced in both rather than a Divine
Knight then maybe you would logically have that ability as you would
receive normal Cleric Spells.

Personally I would like to see the MultiClass idea but doubt we ever
will.
