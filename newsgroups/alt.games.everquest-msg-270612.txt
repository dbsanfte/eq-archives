Having enjoyed being in a guild in EQ1, we've been looking around for one in
EQ2.
Our characters are up to 15 and have developed their tradeskills also, so
hopefully we may have something to offer to a guild.

Anyway, we ended up grouping with someone from a prospective guild the other
night, and it was not fun.
We had never killed Rotweed before(I did let him know that before we went
in), and took a death or two until we got the gist of the spawn waves.
Once we managed to get that done, it was off to get rid of the xp debt - we
ended up in Blackburrow which was realllly scary, and a couple more death
ensued.

After completing our quest and fixing up the xp debt again, we all went our
separate ways.
Although we did get good xp and learn a bit about how the fight goes in a
larger group, I didn't enjoy it as much as being by ourselves.

So what is my point? hehehe...you will also come across people who are
guilded that also have their own agenda, so if you can try a few groups and
see how the people in them interact....you might make some really great
friends that you can group with time and time again.
