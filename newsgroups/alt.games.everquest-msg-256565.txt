This may be a bard "special trick"; since there's no mana cost involved, 
a bard can chain mez a target if he wants to.  Mez interrupts casting, 
and chain mezzing a mob can be a pretty good way of preventing it from 
ever getting off a spell.

Ordinarily, especially with pet classes involved in the kill, its not 
worth your while, but there are spells which really shouldn't be allowed 
(Cheal comes to mind, but there are others just as unpleasant)

Bard should certainly discuss this with you if it happens more than once 
in a rare while... and if he thinks its something to do with every mob, 
even the pure melee ones, well, you need to have a discussion with him, 
he's not singing anything useful at all while doing this!
