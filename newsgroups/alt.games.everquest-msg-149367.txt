    What colour is the sky in your world? Click first cleric, ten seconds.
30 seconds later they finish zoning and join you. You and your buddy now
have 20 seconds to get everyone back. Oh, you get a friend with ten seconds
to go since you didn't stop clicking. So you res six people, the first
cleric you ressed gets two, and the second cleric you ressed gets one. Nine
people does not a raid make.

    Or, you camp back in, cast one spell in 12 seconds, and 30 seconds later
(assuming the zone doesn't crash from a ton of people zoning in at once, tee
hee) the entire raid is looting their corpses. If you're fighting a respawn
timer, this is a world of difference.
