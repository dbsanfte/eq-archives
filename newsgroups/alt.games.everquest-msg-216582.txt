   I have to admit I don't follow the leap that goes from a silly
looking masturbation device to unwilling victims being molested on the
subway.  But if you want, I can provide links of USA made masturbation
devices that are just as odd IMHO.  I happen to think that linking
masturbation to morality is pretty odd of it's own self.  Of all forms
of sexual expression, it seems to me that this one is the safest in
terms of unwanted side effects such as pregnancy and STD's (I don't
believe in the hairy palms or blindness thing).  Yet, American culture
seems to regard it with a revulsion somewhat along the scale as what we
regard insects.  Note that I am speaking to sexual practices done in
private with full consent of the participants (wish isn't really an
issue with masturbation, but I am trying to cover my bases).
