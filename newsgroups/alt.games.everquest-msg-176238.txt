Debatably UO did a bad job of it -- and remember, SWG designers will be able
to learn from UO's mistakes.

Yes, and you can't really get those drops with either (1) a large amount of
money, which is hard to get without combat, or (2) the ability to go kill
the NPCs who have those drops.

Yes, there is.  EQ is geared almost completely towards combat.  That's the
reason.  SWG, on the other hand, has room for a lot of purchases that are
geared towards other professions -- trade ships, computer equipment, various
supplies, systems by which a tradeskiller can hire various PCs to do
missions for them, etc., etc.

Evidently you know nothing about SWG besides what you've decided sitting in
your living room.  In SWG you advance based on use of your skills -- so a
tradeskiller advances just as much through using their tradeskills as a
combatant does using their combat skills.

(1) That was pre-Kunark, which is not now, and (2) the game was *still*
designed for combatants, and tradeskills were very, very difficult with very
few rewards.  Even you admit that you used tradeskills only to buy equipment
for combat.  Which does not make you a tradeskiller.

The point here, Dennis, is that SWG has huge amounts of content geared
specifically towards noncombatants.  There are many, many quests, missions,
equipment to buy, places to go, things to see, NPCs and PCs to deal with in
the course of a day, etc., that should (IMHO) hold the player's interest.  I
personally find it pretty fascinating.  I still plan on my main character
being a combatant (and I know you'll think that is a contradiction of what
I've said so far, but I'd like to learn about combat towards attempting to
become a Jedi -- keyword being "attempting" :) ), but I also plan on having
alts who do various tradeskills.  It looks like those professions will be
quite interesting.

Amazingly large was referring to the numbers.  Small percentage was
referring to the ratio between those numbers and total players.  My point
was that a good number of people exist who want to do tradeskills even in a
game where you're practically punished for doing them.  Yes, there are many
many more in EQ who are strictly or mostly combatant, but that is because
that's what EQ is all about (nothing wrong with that, but there's also
nothing wrong with making a game that encourages tradeskills).

Yes, they have a short lifespan because it doesn't take long for most
players to realize that the game is giving them practically nothing for
their effort, at which point they give up.  A game that gave a player many
rewards for their efforts would encourage them to last longer.

Dennis, you're missing my point.  My point is that tradeskills in SWG will
*not* be like EQ.  In EQ, yes, it's pretty much just "clicking the combine
button".  And if that's all it is then of course tradeskills will be boring.
But the idea is to have a game where there are actually things to do related
to tradeskills.  See above, where I listed a few of the many things that
tradeskillers can do, all in the course of working in their profession (not
as side things they can do to pass the time, but actually things they *need*
to do as part of what they do).

As I said before, UO did a bad job of it.  I'm hoping SWG will do a better
job, and from what they're saying it looks like they will.

It's small, yes.  But it's not self-selected.  It was a random guy who
started a post asking everyone what their chosen profession would be as a
public interest topic.  After getting a number of votes he posted the
results.  I'd say the people on the SWG forums are a pretty good
cross-section of the player population.

Well, we shall see.  I'll take the liberty of disagreeing... as a matter of
fact, as far as I can tell they would have to completely take down the game
and reprogram the whole thing if they decided to remove the tradeskill
content.  I'd say a good 2/3 of the game will contain content pointed
specifically at various noncombatant professions.  Could be wrong though.
