As I stated in another post, he made the outrageous claim
and provided no proof.  I'm not under obligation to disprove
his claim.  He's under obligation to prove his claim.

I bet the magnetic fields in question are much more powerful
than the "healing magnets" drugstores sell, which is what I
really had in mind.

I'm not against research being done on the subject.  However,
until multiple reputable sources can confirm some positive
results, I won't be buying drugstore magnets for healing
purposes.

I consider myself an open minded skeptic.  I was attempting
to point out to the other poster that all skeptics shouldn't
be painted in the same way: as close minded.
