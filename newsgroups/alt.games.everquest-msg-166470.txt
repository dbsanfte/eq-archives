I tried another game Morrowind and still got problems so it's not unique for
EQ, I have been looking at settings and now play on a TFT monitor Eizo L365,
15 inch.

Anti-glare-filter, I will buy that, it seems a cheap investment, polaroid
glasses, maybe I can get monitor glasses with that feature when I look at
glasses.
It might be stress but then I think the stress is triggered by the game, the
colors, flashing lights etc.

The strange thing is I could play before and now I can't =(
