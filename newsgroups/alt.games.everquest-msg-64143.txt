Just to let everybody know,, when you cancle a download (or it crashes), the
everqueste.exe program does NOT get removed from memory.  So, it still has a
lock on some files and further attempts to modify those files will fail.
Make sure you either restart or ctrl-alt-del and kill the old everquest.exe
before trying  to install again.
