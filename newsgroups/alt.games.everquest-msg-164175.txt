I, for one, dont understand why one would work so hard at getting focus II
gear because I have never heard of anyone actively trying to level down. I
would be looking at getting focus III because it will give you room to grow
into and will work with appropriate types of spells 60 and under. In short,
dont knock yourself out outfitting yourself with second class gear that you
cant even use your best spells with.
