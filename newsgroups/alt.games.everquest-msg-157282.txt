Yeah, those kinds of things. I got the Pet Shrink a new PBAEMez for my
Enchanter. No luck finding the new 44th level Illusion, but some of the
Enchanter spell vendors have a bunch of Wiz only and Mag only spells on
them. So I'm hoping they'll fix that (I /bug'd it) and put that spell in
there. Though I've heard it's supposed to be quested.
