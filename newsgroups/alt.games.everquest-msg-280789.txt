Not that I share the OP's opinion, but the answer to Lief's
question is, The other players.

Sure, you could deliberately play so as not to use any of the newer
content.  Run places instead of using PoK.  (Well, there's no boats,
but you can talk to the gnomes and pretend you used a boat.  Actually,
you don't need boats much if you're restricting yourself to Antonica.)
Don't go to the newer zones, don't use tribute, etc.  If you die below
level 10, pretend all your gear is still on your corpse and if you
can't get the corpse you destroy all your gear (ouch).  But you still
won't be able to recapture the original EQ experience, because of the
other players.

Say that, to recapture the old game, you want to go to some out of the
way place and stay there a week, because getting there is hard enough
that you don't want to run back and forth a lot.  Used to be, there'd
be lots of people in that situation, so there'd be many people camped
in the good hunting areas, and you could hope to find groups, make new
friends, etc.  Now those areas are empty because (a) there are better
spots and (b) it's easy enough to get to those areas if you decide you
want to.  So the anachronist camping there is screwed because all the
other players aren't hanging around to help reproduce the experience.

Similar, wizard/druid ports aren't as much in demand (though I do still
see some offers and requests), so you're less likely to find a porter
when you want one.  Especially if you're avoiding PoK.

Want to do some tradeskilling and make some plat selling to players?
First off, good luck finding a buyer if you're avoiding PoK and the
Bazaar.  Sure, you might, but you're missing 99%+ of your market.  And
on top of that, the gear you're making isn't as uber as it used to be,
so fewer people want it.  (There are newer tradeskill recipes that make
better stuff, but to make those items you probably need to hunt in
places outside of the original EQ zones.)
