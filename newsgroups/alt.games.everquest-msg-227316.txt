The problem is, if you dont you end up with the page having 700 DKP and
better gear than the enchanter who attends twice as many raids and
has half as much DKP because they had to compete on the enchanter only
drops.

And then the super-duper-int-caster-robe drops. And the enchanter,
who 'merits' it more, cant buy it because the freebie-happy mage
hasnt had to actually pay for any loot.

The problem starts when a member working harder in a competitive class
has to compete against a slacker in an underepresented class. Bid systems
have other flaws - they allow cartels and 'favour' price fixing too,
especially on class only items. If you have 3 monks and they arrange
who will get items in what order, so they dont have to bid, then when
the high hp/atk all/all items drop they have way more DKP to spend than
the classes not playing the system.

The last guild I was in before I quit had fixed prices that *never*
changed, and the DKP value per raid was ( total_value_of_drops_ever / 
total_number_of_players_ever ) * 0.75

This gave a pretty good zero-sum approximation; items that rotted
didnt count in total_value_of_drops , so mobs value depreciated over
time as they became less worth doing and people consequently became
less enthused about raiding them - a nice feedback loop. Everybody
got the items at the same price for the same work, so no discontent
there, and 'high input' players go tstuff first by virtue of having
high DKP totals.

This worked very very well; it was in a hardcore raid guild though,
doing 5-6 hours of raiding every weeknight, more on weekends, and
we farmed like crazy so there was never a 'but I'll never get item
X' issue other than for crazy-rare-drops, as we'd keep going back
untill everyone had what they wanted.

It solely rewarded attendance - the downside - but was very very hard
to 'fix' the system , beyond having people botting you at raids, and
that was punished pretty severely.

Sure. And then your warriors obey market economics and go somewhere they
get paid better and nobody gets to play ;) Its simply not fair if you
need , say, 8 clerics but only 2 shamans that the clerics, who are just
as vital to your success, are rewarded proportionately far less well.

And they wont stay, if thats the case.

No; the free market you espouse balances based solely on numeric makeup
of the guild and pays no attention to the need of the guild. You simply
cant raid (as well) with a guild that has an exactly even number of every
class as one that is better made up around the raid requirements.

Droppable loots were still done NBG, and remained guild property - i.e.
you dont spend any points for your uber-tradable-bp, but you dont get
to keep it. You want your OWN gear, you buy it. 

It worked pretty well, but you have to bear in mind that at the high end
raiding levels pretty much everything is no drop.

We had bards buy ifir before all the rogues had it, a warrior who bought
a SEWS and a BOW, etc. But the simple fact is, if a warrior is playing
enough to be buying super-high-ticket items like a SEWS and a BOW then
the paladin who plays once a day is just going to have to wait to play. 

It got to the stage all the rangers had SEWs by the end, so its not like
there could really be justifiable complaints. There were, maybe, 2 cases
in my memory of 'spite buys' and they were very frowned upon (I buy to
stop you getting), but still... the spite-buyer had earnt their points
and next time round the 'victim' got their toy, so we just sucked it up.

Bidding is the absolute devil. It is SO SO open for abuse its just not
funny. One guild on our server did 'blind bidding'; tell the officer
how much you want to pay, then they announce the winner. I mean, how
open for abuse is *that*? (And it was abused, repeatedly, apparently.)

Shrug. None of the officers in AOC wanted points; but they were happy
to go with it on the condition that:
A clear majority voted for it
Someone else designed the system and it was approved by the vote in (1)
someone else undertook the hassle of keeping track of the points

So. Not *all* officers are self serving ;)

The whole thing can begin to collapse if you dont raid targets till
at least the majority get the loot they want; if you have someone with
500 RP who only has to spend 20 on an item and you only raid it 4
times before moving on (Classic 'The officers have their loot, new
target!' issue) then allowing a build up (non zero sum) points accumulation
can lock some people out of ever getting loot at all.
