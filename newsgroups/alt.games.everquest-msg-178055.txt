If you're comfortable with taking apart at least one machine to upgrade a 
card, then it shouldn't be a problem doing 2, especially since they will be 
using the same exact driver executable.  You should put the cards where you 
want them.  I'd put the nicer one in the machine that has the potential to 
see the most gaming.

I ( and NVidia ) recommend that you uninstall the old driver before 
installing the new one instead of just overwriting the old driver with the 
new one.

If you use the computer that now has the 64meg card the most, download to 
both machines the latest NVidia driver that you consider stable, uninstall 
the current drivers, shut them down, swap the 64meg to PC2, put the 128meg 
in PC1, crank them back up and install the new drivers.  If you're on 
broadband, this should take mere minutes.  I did this exact thing between 
pops at a camp on Tuesday evening.
