Actually, /as %t is not redundant, as it has an entirely different
fuction than /as.  If you create a hotkey that says /as %t, it will
work perfectly the first time you use it.  However it will replace %t
with whomever you have targetted the first time you use it.  
For example, say that Bananarama is your tank.  As a melee damage
dealer you want to be assisting Bananarama, so you create a hotkey
that says /as %t.  A mob comes in, Bananarama starts bashing it and
calls for others to join in.  You mash you /as %t hotkey and happily
bash along with Bananarama.  Several hours pass, Bananarama has to
log, and Walamadamadingdong replaces Bananarama as your tank.  The
first mob comes, Walamadamadingdong calls for everyone to assist, you
mash your assist button, and nothing happens.  If you look at your
hotkey, you will see that instead of saying /as %t, it says /as
Bananarama.
I just modify my hotkey to say /assist <tankname> everytime we change
MA.  For healers and others who need to pop between targets, a hotkey
that just says /assist is perfect, since it will assist whomever you
have targetting, including the mob.
