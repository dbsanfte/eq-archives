Their revamps have been bad of late.  See Hate and VP.  Why revamp CT?  That
is a great place for 50-60.  Best non-raid zone in the game at those levels,
IMO, for loot anyway.  They need a place like that for 65+ groups, but why
redo CT when it works?

LOL.  This kills me.  Still kind of sad they wont allow a one time
respending of character creation points.  I mean, the stats they recommend
for classes even to this day are fucking mind numbing.  Start a newb and
experiment.  I hope they dont get the guy writing the docs and strat guide
to do this.

This is great and long overdue.  DoTs really suck compared to nukes because
of the SCF line of AAs and the lack of an ID line of focus items for DoTs.

This is interesting.  The loot in most of these zones is pretty poor, but
not sure if they should go back and boost them or not.  With high level
spawns being pretty much dead in a day or two on most servers, this is going
to lead to guilds 'past' this content going back for the loot, in addition
to the times they already go back, albeit infrequently, for flags.  I am in
favor of adding 1 groupable drops to these zones, but not sure how good of
an idea it is to make the bosses drop better stuff.  Although, damn, Bert
and especially RD and Saryrn have really crappy stuff compared to your
average VT boss, who is worlds easier.  Agnarr and the Zeks have some good
stuff already, I think.

I am sure I am biased since I play a caster, but I guess this means they are
done with caster balance?  What did they do beyond adding focus items and
new spells/AAs (a lot of them very shitty) with the expansion?  Not saying
some melee classes dont need a DPS injection, but just wondering what
happened to the caster balancing?

This would be cool, as shields really suck now.  I dont seem them getting
this right though, this seems out of their league.

Fix Smithing.  Its by far the hardest trade to advance.  Tailoring is also
pretty crappy, the rest are cakewalks comparitively.
