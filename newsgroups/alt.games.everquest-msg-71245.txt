I like to get as much healing done *before* the combat as possible, but not
waste any healing of course. reason: If you heal in a fight, it will get you
agro. Tanks that want to stay really hurt "so they keep the agro" are a
menace. As soon as theres a double, unless youve got a second tank doing
taunting or some other form of cc, its game over. Sometimes even a single
will get taunted onto you if you have to do loads of healing.
