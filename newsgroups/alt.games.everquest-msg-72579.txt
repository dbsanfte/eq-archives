Well, you can certainly question my -conclusions-, but as to
"authenticity"...  I haven't a clue why you chose to use that word here. It
makes no sense in that sentence.

I was repeating what my experience in Camelot was. I am using the staff and
the "armor "that was given to me in character creation, since I have very
little money to buy any that would be better. As to casting, I was standing
at the farthest range of the spell, cast at least 3 times before the critter
reached me, then I beat on it. Is that proper? I was told by several others
that it was. For whatever reason, Sprint did not work for me, not when I was
engaged in combat. It worked perfectly fine otherwise, and yes, I noticed
the stamina drain. I ran when I was down to what I considered an
unacceptable level, just as in EQ -- just before I get to 2 bb of health. If
that's too late, then I was misjudging it. Mea culpa.
