It only would on a pvp server, and I only believe a non team one (can
you hurt members of the same team on sullon zek or the other team pvp?
Not sure)

The reason why you don't want to use it in dungeon groups is because
almost invariably you'd be with a chanter or someone mezzing adds. As
you might guess an AOE weapon is bad for adds so the weapon is fairly
panned. Now, if you plan to solo or small group outdoors and might
occasionally get 1 or more mobs with no one mezzing its fine. 

It can be had pretty cheap due to the AOE.
