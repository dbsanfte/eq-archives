Though I too was angered by the photos, I can't see how anyone could even 
compare them to the sawing off of a man's head as he screamed in mortal 
terror and agony.

Don't try to minimize the evil they showed in that one horrifying act

their disregard for human life and justifies our being there in the first 
place.
