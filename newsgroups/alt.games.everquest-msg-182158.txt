That's one thing that's nice about the newbie armor... it can be done in stages that take you
up to level 12, easily.  I did that with my halfling druid.  I snare-dot-nuke kited  yellow cons for
their drops for my armor all the way to level 12.  Got all my newbie armor, then left misty
thicket :)   I haven't played him much since then, but he's still wearing all newbie armor at 16.

The only frustrating thing, is that some of the harder armor to obtain has an annoyingly rare
drop rate of the needed items.
