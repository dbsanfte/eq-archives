Verant really screwed the pooch on the wood elf ranger gauntlets, as well as on
two drops for the dwarf pally armor quests.  I have been told that the ulna
drops from the orc scoutsman in CB and deathfist scouts in Nek, but so far,
after over a dozen scout and scoutsman kills in Nek and CB, I have yet to see a
single ulna drop.  Also found a spawn point for orc scoutsmen in Butcherblock,
but those have only dropped the scoutsman wristpouch (one in CB drops the lute a
lot, but have yet to see the pouch or ulna).  The spawn times on both the
deathfist scouts and the scoutsman in CB are rediculous - scoutsman is a 1 hour
spawn!  Jeez the nice Gnoll Basher Club items were easier to get than these
supposed newbie drops.  I also have killed hundreds of green goblins of all
sorts in butcherblock and have yet to find a goblin skull.  One piece short for
the wood elf ranger gauntlets (orc ulna) and one short on the dwarf pally helm
(goblin skull) and the pally bracers (shattered warbeads).  Both final tasks
were relatively easy to do compared to these three armor items.  I play on
Vazaelle.  Have any of you on other servers ever seen any of these drops?  If
so, do you recall which mob dropped them?
