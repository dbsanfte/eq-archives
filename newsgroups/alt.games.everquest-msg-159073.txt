NO.  A druids defining ability is that while they dont excel in any one
place, they can do some of almost everything.
Root, Best snarer, Dots, Nukes, DS on a par with mages, stat buffs, HP
buffs, MANA REGEN, best resist buffs, ATk buffs, mob debuffs, best SoW,
levitation, invis, see invis, porting

Ports (evacs) save your ass in combat, and allow you to escape/bypass
difficult zones (e.g SG)

And guess what, YOU STILL CAN.

Porting hasnt been nerfed.  Its still the fastest method of transport.

You can port from ANYWHERE*, the rest of us have to zone into PoK and then
zone to a nearby city to our destination.

* Not including VP, but thats a huge exception zone really....

take place.

Please, feel free to correct me, Im sure I skipped that particular post
somewhere
