Kill spiders in FoB and save the silks; combine two silks (unstacked) in a loom
to make a silk swatch. Once you have a stack or two of swatches /auc for a
tailor to make you some Cured Silk. The cost should be minimal since you're
providing your own swatches.

In the short term you can try making your own Raw Silk armor to fill any gaps in
your Curscale. I never was able to get a curscale tunic so I made a raw silk
tunic for my completely untwinked monk.

Go kill an Iksar Bandit and loot his mask. It's a better face item than the
curscale and it weighs zero.

The Excellent Sabretooth hides are used in Wood Elf cultural tailoring. You'll
probably have to get onto your server's auction channel to unload those but they
should sell for a nice price.
