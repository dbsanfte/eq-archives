Hi all,

	I was in the same boat with my (now lvl16) Pally.  Didn't have
Luclin and therfore couldn't get to the bazaar.  A bloke offered me a
Crystalized 2H sword for 100pp but, thankfully, that was more than I
had.  Bit the bullet and bought EQ Gold, mainly for Luclin and the
Bazaar.  Ended up with the Sword of Xalgoz with damage/delay ratio of
a little over 0.5 for only 75pp.  It's awsome.

	Find someone you trust and ask them to go to the bazaar and buy
you one.  Group so they can tell you the price and stats before they
buy (could also use /tell but I think grouping is easier).  If you
were on Mith Marr Server, I would do it but I think you said elsewhere
you aren't.

	Want to see what I bought?  Have a look at this:

	Good luck.

Regards,

Wayne...
