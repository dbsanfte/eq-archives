I'd consider yourself lucky if you can get a port for 20 plat. I know
that in the time I take to zone twice now in EQ I'm sure as heck not
porting you for only 20 plat or probably even 200. If I'm going there
anyway I'd probably take you for free but how often does that happen?
It happens next to never for me. I'm a druid though, I'd gladly
translocate someone for 20 plat but I don't get that ;)
