There are indeed, though each city consists of lots of 'towns' for each 
race, these are all confined within the city walls.

Yes, you do indeed have to choose one of the two cities to align with, 
however when you see this actually in action it makes a lot more sense 
than you think. When I first heard about this, coming from EverQuest 1, 
I thought it sounded an awful idea, incredibly over-simplified (compared 
to the spectrum of factions that you got with the cities in EQ1 which 
were also nicely spread out) but when you get into the game, both the 
design of the cities and the storyline help to make this situation seem 
more realistic...basically the races banded together to place their 
hometowns within the safety of the cities so as to avoid trouble with 
races they weren't as keen on.

I haven't tried enterring Freeport but from what I hear, if you're 
spotted by guards (and if Qeynos is anything to go by, there are a lot 
of guards) you merely get evicted straight onto the Commonlands outside 
the city walls.
