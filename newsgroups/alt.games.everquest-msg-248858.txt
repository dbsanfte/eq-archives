IMO an insinuation is just an accusation from someone either (usually) too
weak to say what they mean explicitely, or (in Annie's case) wants to soften
it to be nice.  If there is another definition you think is more real then
I'd like to hear it.  But please dont copy from dictionary.  Explain how you
think insinuation is 'different' from accusation.
