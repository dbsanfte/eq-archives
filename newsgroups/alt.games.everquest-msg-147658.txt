For your information , my mother and  an uncle both passed away due to
cancer, and as far as other countries that suffer from terrorism every
day, when did you ever live in them. While I was in the military over
seas "I" was a target of terrorism, I've lived in cities where people
were getting blown up every day. You ever see the aftermath of a bus
bomb. No. Well, you are lucky then.
