I am a parent.

And yes they should worry about a game.

I ask you this then, do _you_ belive everything you read?

A little time and effort, searching of the net would allow them to make an
informed decision. Its like saying "I dont have to know what my kids are
watching on TV"

You catch your kid watching something he/she shouldnt - do you balme the
network? Do you sue the cable company?

It come down to knowing your childeren, and what they can handle. If a
parent can not find the time for that, they should not have childeren. There
is NO excuse for bad parenting, eaven saying "well there should have been a
warning" when, in fact, the parent should have taken the time to research
and consider what the child was getting into.

And before we get into a bigger flame war, I am NOT calling you a bad parent
so chill.

I kill this thred now and will not look for a responce. This country needs
to wake up.
