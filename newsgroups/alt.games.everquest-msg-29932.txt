    Yes. Any number of your characters can have the same surname. As far as
I can tell by all the "Hug", "Cry", and "Aluba" characters on our server at
various times, there is no limit between accounts as to last names, either.

    Sigh - my one shot at EQ marriage fell through over the name. My cleric
was NOT going to be "Delores Shadowblade", and he thought "Ghrim Mulva"
sounded like a disease.
