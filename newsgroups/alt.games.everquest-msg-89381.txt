Go for Magic resist 150, poison resist 120, fire (nasty spell boil blood
only one) 70, disease seems not very potent for him at his level

Fingers: 2 Velium diamond rings 8 to all resists
chest: sarnak emblazend tabard 10svM very cheap
face : split paw mask 5svM very cheap

Do you start buffed ?  If you can - SOW, buff and fire resist yourself with
all you got.

There are nice potions that can be used

The caster has 500 HP and you maybe have 1000 HP.

I would get as high resists as I could and then initially 1. snare pet, 2.
root pet, 3 snare caster and maybe root too 4 hit caster with all you got
Try avoiding pet but go for caster all the time, never hit pet.  If he can't
land spells because of resists you can melee caster down quick, before pet
kills you.  If caster is smart enough to stand close to pet then stand so
that pet can't hit you from behind if possible (so that you can parry etc).
But go for getting the HP of the caster down to 0.  The caster has about 500
HP.  If caster is standing close to pet and root breaks for pet , then the
pet will go after you and you can root him away from caster which is nice.

You will of course need Magic resistance (fear is awful) 100+, posion
resist100+, fire resist maybe disease resist (disease seems not very potent
at his level).
Some cheap stuff that migh be useful is face: Split paw mask 5 MR, neck:
Collor of undead protection is a must 7 dis, 7 pois.  chest: sarnak tabard
10 MR etc  Go to eqprices and search for cheap stuff with resists.  Go to
www.castersrealm.com and see what spells he will be likely to cast on you at
his level.  That can give a clue to if disease is better than poision etc.

Pet is not likely to resist root/snare and is useless as long as he can't
stand beside you. That is an advantage for you.  Keep pet rooted away from
you if possible.

Get high damage arrows and be ready to use them if caster standing close to
pet nad your health gets low.  Have "cancel magic memed" if you get some
spell on you.  Have stinging swarm memed for offense.
