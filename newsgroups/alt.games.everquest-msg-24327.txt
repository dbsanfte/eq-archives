Ok, I'm working on increasing some of my melee skills. I was told you can
only increase your melee skills fighting things blue to you or above. But
I've noticed that when I go after some things that are green, my skill will
increase as well? Is there a rule somewhere that states what level of mob
you need to be fighting in order to increase your skill?
I've also noticed this for XP as well. I thought you only got XP for blue
and above. But i've killed things that were green and everyonce in a while,
I get XP. NOT alot mind you, but the window reports it and I can see it in
the XP window.

Thanks all in advance for any info!
