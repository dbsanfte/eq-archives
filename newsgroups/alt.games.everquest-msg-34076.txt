Just found this on Gamespot while I was browsing it with insomnia early in the
morning.  While I'm sure the Model won't work, it does certainly put a whole
new perspective on the whole Ebay aspect of Everquest.  Seems in this new game
you get it for free, and can pump real life money into the game to develope
your character.  Of course if it's anything like Buying Magic the Gathering
cards you'll have extremely broke 12 year olds and strange 55 year olds all
over the country paying/playing it.
