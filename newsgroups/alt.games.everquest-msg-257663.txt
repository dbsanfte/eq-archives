In that case, I want the mmorpg I have been envisioning. As soon as I
get around to typing the whole thing out it will be as real as Dawn
was. :-p

My job has long, boring stretches where I barely need to be conscious
let alone focused. This gives me time to think about what exactly I
want... and after hours and hours and hours I've gotten it pretty down
pat I think. All I need is a few million dollars and a team of
programmers and I promise you I'd make the best mmorpg ever....

I would want something a little (actually a lot) more than that, but
since I am thinking holistically it is impossible to describe without
describing everything it depends on as well and I'm not really up to a
ten thousand line post just now. Other flamewars and stuff, you
know... :-)

Historically means nothing to me. It is possible to punish them, and I
would rather have that in future games than simply preventing anyone
from doing anything.

But I am not talking about the existing setup - nothing can be done
for games already made. I am talking our hypothetical future
entres....
