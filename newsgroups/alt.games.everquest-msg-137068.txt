 Probably to let people know it's there. It's easy to close so no big
deal. However, being a new feature some may not know how to turn it on
(Alt-F1) and may not even realize it's there at all.

 Redoing things I've found to be annoying. If you load a new skin you
have to reset everything as well. Needless to say I haven't been trying
any new skins lately. I just have the one loaded and if I want to try a
mod I copy it into that directory.

 Same thing for Tracking. In the old interface, hitting ESC would cancel
tracking. Now you actually have to click Cancel in the window or it will
just go on telling you where your tracked target is in relation to
yourself.

 Not sure I've found anyone who liked it. That was one of the first mods
I started looking for.

 True, it's a bit fuzzy with all those hash marks. Look for the mods
that show percentages then you don't need to really worry about where
the blue line is.

 Yep. New interface was a loss of functionality, imo, compared to
/hitsmode. Luckily, according to Absor, they are going to be setting
hitsmode up for the new interface. That's my main complaint so far. If
they give us back what we had before the remainder of my complaints
about the new interface will be small.

 Yes, especially when it gets close to 10% since the enrage messages go
into the melee window, helpfully enough.

>Buff icons..  dear me, these were supposed to be improvements?

 Actually I think they are. The first day or do I didn't know what the
hell was going on. Now, since I mainly only get 12 or so of the same
buffs every raid, it's easy to see what I have with a quick glance. And
if I forget I just hold the Alt down and move the cursor over the buff
box and I see all the names.

 Redoing my Druids spellbook was a pain though. Still not done but as
least I have the most frequently used ones organized as well as all the
ports.
