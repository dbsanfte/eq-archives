Perhaps it would be helpful if you mentioned what you didn't like about 
WoW. As far as basic gameplay goes, I'd give the edge to EQ. WoW group 
encounters seemed like free-for-alls with everyone doing their own thing, 
while EQ tends to cater more to coordinated efforts.

That's just the tip of the iceberg as far as the differences between the 
two games are concerned, though. Personally, I liked WoW ok. I just didn't 
find it as interesting. /shrug
