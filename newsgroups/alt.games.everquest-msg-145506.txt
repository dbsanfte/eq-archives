Situational Laziness. Snare is so damn useful that some folks get into the
habit of casting it first in EVERY situation.

There's times when pulling with snare is actually dangerous...

For example, you've Harmonied the camp... so far so good.

You pull the closest Mob with snare... and he starts taking his own sweet
time lumbering over towards you... you begin casting the first DoT.

Harmony breaks... while snared mob is still within 'normal' agro range!!

Whole camp charges towards you... minus the snared mob that is now blocking
your F8 that you're now mashing away at like your life depends on it...
which it does :o)

You now have about 3 seconds to learn this 'quadding technique' you read
about on various boards :oD
Oh, and because it's been a while since you refreshed it, your SoW icon just
started blinking ;oD
