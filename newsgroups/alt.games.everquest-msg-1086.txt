I didn't know you could twist both of the DOT songs together.  Doh...  I've been twisting Boastful Bellow with the Warsong and
Heal when soloing (can't remember all of the names).  But I have used Denons when I get attacked by multiple mobs (never with a
horn though, except for practice in EFP newbie area).

Generally, I only switch to instruments when I'm not directly engaged in combat,  I have never been able to juggle instruments
while twisting, The old hotkey trick for instrument/weapon slots just hasn't panned out for me.  My understanding from what I've
read is that it would allow me to switch instruments quickly but the number keys for that slot don't do anything at all, and if
I try swapping with the mouse, half the time the program thinks I'm trying to drop the item, or I click on the wrong button on
the panel (I once used my Denon's Disruptive Discord instead of Charismatic Carilon by accident. Kind of had the exact opposite
of the intended affect.)  And I swear that my mouse ponter seems to disappear from one side of the screen and reappear on the
wrong button on the wrong side fo the screen for no apparent reason (no, I'm not clicking on any button or key when it happens).
When it happens, it so completely disorients me while I try to locate the mouse pointer that I screw up any twisting that I'm
trying to do at the same time.  And this is a fairly new Mouse also...  I need a method of juggling instruments that works with
Keyboard only.

In any case, what I'm really looking for is a place where it's easy to find a group.  Oasis was great through level 17, but at
18, it sucks.  You can't get a decent group.  Occasionallly you can get a partner, but I've had very bad luck with partners
there.  Maybe I will try Highpass.  When I passed through, everyone there was yellow or red to me, but I still might be able to
get in.  I had considered Everfrost also.  

BTW, I realize that armor is real important for me, but I'm not giving up my Polished Granite Tomahawk.  It procs Berzerk
strength, which makes me invulnerable to a few attacks for a short period of time.  Imho, it gives me a nice defensive bonus on
occasion without actually increasing my AC.   And it sometimes procs as much as 3-4  times in a single combat (of course, it
also sometimes doesn't proc at all).

At  18, should I be using a shield instead of dual wield?  That would make sense from what you are telling me, but most articles
I've read said that I SHOULD dual wield.  Instrument figthting with DOT spells are a bit scary anyway, as with my luck, I always
miss that Red NPC hidden from view behind a tree or hilltop.  And rumor has it that they tend to draw mobs to you that aren't
even (yet) within its AOE.  I have no evidence to dispute that...

As far as buying Bronze armor, as I said I'm almost penniless.  HOWEVER, I almost forgot that I do have a couple of nice armor
pieces that I bought at fire-sale prices (I almost feel guilty about it, they were so cheap, but I couldn't resist).   I'd been
considering selling them anyway, which shoudl allow me to buy the Bronze armor.  Maybe it would allow me to get something better
even...  One thing that I'm worried about is the weight, though, as Banded is heavy enough as it is.

Anyway, thank you very much for the advice.  I'm definately going to keep at it for a bit longer before I abandon my Bard
entirely.  Maybe I'll try complaining to Logitech about the mouse problems as well.
