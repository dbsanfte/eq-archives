2000 pts? 4 Anger II augs? You didn't realize what weapons should be
augged so you augged them all? Great way to waste points. And if you
augged a CHoS, you need to pick another class.

There aren't any neck items that you can buy with AP in LDoN that are
even remotely worth the AP spent. Off slot items in LDoN are pure
shit. Just buy something better in the bazaar.

SK.. tell that pimp to VoT you if you have to have one in group. Any
decent SK can control his agro when not MT, if they can't boot them.
Pally can control his agro too unless he's fucking around, and if so,
boot him.

The only main armor slot item i ever bought was the Greaves of the
Sand. And that was because augged and stuff you couldn't really buy or
get significantly better until Elemental Greaves, and those were
extremely rare at the time. Ornate were close, but a nice chunk of
change and still inferior.
