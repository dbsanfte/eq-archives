Hasn't EA always been in the game with Ultima Online?  It's apparently
not that much money for them, though, "Subscription Services" were only 2%
of their revenue last quarter.

Hmm... I'm not too sure how attractive MMORPGs actually are.  At first
glance there seems to be almost no downside risk, very few have failed
and stopped operating.  But that may be deceiving, it's worth while to
continue operating a MMORPG so long as you can earn more in subscription
fees than it costs to keep it running.  That's true even the game has
no hope of ever making a net profit over its life time once the cost
of developing it in the first place is figured in.  So, it could be
the most MMORPGs have failed to be profitable, despite the fact that
they're still operating.  It's clearly not cheap to develop an MMORPG,
I don't think there's a more expensive kind of game to create, so the
actual risk may be quite daunting.
