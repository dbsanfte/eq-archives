Why a new client?  I am currently playing with only the original
game loaded.  I have Kunark and Velious, but never reloaded them
when I started playing again.  It would seem to me a simple
matter to remove all the zones provided by the expansions -- and
also provide a smaller operating expense to Verant with less
servers to maintain for that world.
