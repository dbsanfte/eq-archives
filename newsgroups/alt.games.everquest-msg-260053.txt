Ya know, Palindrome, I give up on you.  Believe whatever simple-minded
nonsense you want.  My only hope is your lousy over-simplified advice
doesn't mislead people from seeking help who need it.

For everyone else: if you recognize you have a problem with addiction,
spend some time talking to a qualified professional about it. Don't
pay attention to this nonsense "armchair psychologist" crapola being
spouted by Palindrome.

Sure, if you have an eating disorder, or a sexual addiction, or a
gambling addiction, or an EverQuest addiction, you just MIGHT be able
to apply "Palindrome's Quick 'N Easy Fix-All Solution", but you know,
you'll probably have a LOT better luck getting REAL help from someone
who knows what the fuck they're talking about.
