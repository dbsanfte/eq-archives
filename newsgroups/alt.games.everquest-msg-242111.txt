Well, I am not one to jump in SOE's defense, but the more I think of it, 
the more I am confident, that updating an entire graphics engine may 
cause a few problems that were not forseen.

Let us think of it this way. You have a house built in 1974, that is 
being modernized. The check list of changes would be unending. Wireing, 
plumbing, roofing, insulation, etc etc. The possibility of error, in not 
conforming with a home of 2004, would be quite great.

Allthough it can be argued that OUR house was built in 1999, not 1974. 
What is more valid is the faster advancement of computer technology, 
over building supplies :)

But what do I know? I am just bored and specualting :)
