I'm not entirely sure, reports have varied.  But it is quite possible that 
a person has used memblur, FD, or atone or similar, or is doing a 
considerable portion of their damage with damage shields.  So even though 
they have the mob down to 10%, and you're only nuking it for 9%, you can 
still KS them accidentally, when it turns out 95% of the damage they did 
was unattributed for one reason or another.

Asking is good.
