    Uulump, I think? I can't imagine why someone would have to use bind
rushing for him and have the forces to complete the rest of the epic, but I
will concede he'd be a good target for it.

    I can, no problem. But the <insert good race> tank cannot, and I kinda
need them to do my best work. That's what kills these zones - if a section
of the population is excluded, then people say "oh, nobody goes there" and
it becomes self-fulfilling. Imagine how many more folks might be there if,
say, the Feerrott druid rings were bindable. Then you have a routine - port
in, bind, run to Cazic. At the very least "people who adventure together"
would go there.

    Not just a random group. My example is a bunch of folks I know from
Washington state who all play the game. All on my server, I play with them.
We have various trios - SHM/ENCH/WAR, WAR/ROG/DRU, NEC/MAG/MAG - that I play
with two of them. Do you think they want to do ANYTHING adventurous with
those first two combos? Why do you suppose they don't? Is it because after
ONE disaster ate their entire play day and more that they decided they
didn't want to be that pissed off ever again? They die, they scoop gear - XP
loss wasn't the issue. It's the idea of doing nothing with a play session
except try and get your body while naked that turns them off.

>but I don't see a lot of people

    It's the only thing that stopped me from trying Sol A with my melee
(well, trying it beyond safe zone pulls and babysitter groups). The idea
that I'd end up spending a large chunk of my evening running from Freeport
to Sol A is quite unappealing, even if I would have had the naked warrior
for company.

    Heh. Given the seriously funky places I've seen some folks bound after
they die, I imagine you'd be able to keep your bind point. I have yet to
hear a group ask my cleric, "So, you're bound outside, right?" It might
become a part of raid protocols, but the post-raid port should take you
close to where you want to be re-bound.

    Try and find a Locket of Escape. 8)
