It's been about a year since I did the quest with my old guild.....

From what I remember you give some kind of drink/cask item to 1 of 3
different callers. There are 3 different levels of difficulty (based
on the caller you hand the item to). The main difference is the time
between "calls" (waves). With 2 groups of 50-60s we could handle any
of the three levels of difficulty. At one point we had two callers
running (slowest and fastest if memory serves), but after a while
things got a little tense. With hardly any downtime between waves, it
became harder and harder to keep mana levels up for our Clerics and
Chanters.
