As the previous poster noted, this IS working as Verant intended.  I did the same thing trying to drop-transfer between my druid and my
warrior.  Lost a full BP of crafted - close to 2kp worth.  The GM I talked to said to re-petition a senior GM the following night.  The
following night, I was told that, although the bag poofed when the warrior tried to pick it up, I could have camped and relogged my druid
and she could have picked it up again.  DOH!
