I guess you never tried doing phone tech support with a clueless newbie. 
(read: average person)  Apple was bang on when they figured the averge 
PC user can't figure out a two button mouse. I do phone support 
occasionally as part of my job, and I've had more conversations like 
this than I can count:

ME: Double click on the "My Computer" icon.
EU: A menu came up.
ME: Make sure you double *left* click on the "My Computer" icon.
EU: oh ok... ... ... a menu came up.
ME: Are you sure you're using the left mouse button?
EU: Oh... wait no... that's the other one. A windows opened!
ME: Great... now right click on your C: drive.
EU: Ok...now I see "Documents and Settings", "Program Files", etc...

At which point I realize he's double left clicked again...instead of 
right clicked once...

Nope... average users don't need 2 buttons.

And for what its worth, you can take your shiny Microsoft USB 
intellimouse optical 5 button wheel mouse and plug it into a Mac... and 
it works just fine. The right mouse button even does what you expect it 
too in MS Office:Mac etc...

Other than video games, and legacy business apps theres not much 
significant a Mac can't do (and with virtual PC legacy business apps 
aren't an issue either). And with windows networking support, and Citrix 
and Terminal Services clients available they fit into the average office 
scenario without a glitch.

  Myself, I use PC desktops mostly because I want the games library... 
but my laptop is a Mac. And my next one will be too.
