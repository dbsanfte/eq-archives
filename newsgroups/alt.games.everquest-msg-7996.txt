    Ha ha ha... if you're worried about having space for 3 plat worth of
coins, then the answer to your question is an infinite amount plus 3 plat.

    3 plat per day is not fast compared to what the bank can hold.
    There are supertwinks that trade items for 25,000 plat.
    Personally I've transfered about 1000 plat into copper just to see if it
would handle it.  The bank did... but I couldn't move when I tried to carry
it.
