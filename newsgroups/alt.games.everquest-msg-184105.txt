   Okay.  Makes sense to me.  But do you really think that that's
what was going on inside the collect mind of SOE when they
designed the race?  In a way this explanation reminds me of the
discussions on the Star Trek newsgroup where fans would give
elaborate theories to reconcile the numerous logic and continuity
errors in the latest installation of "Voyager".  Interesting,
perhaps.  But I got the feeling that they were putting a heck of
a lot more thought into the plots than the actual writers ever
did.
