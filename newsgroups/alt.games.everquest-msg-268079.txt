You can send cross server tells easily enough, but I haven't yet found a way
to join an EQ channel.  (actually I'm having problems getting the stupid
interface to join an EQ2 serverwide chat channel)

Really wish they had kept the chat commands from EQ1.  They may have been a
bit clunky, but at least I knew them.  (and the new ones aren't any less
clunky, just different.)  I can't tell you how many times I've done /list  and
gotten annoyed at seeing "Davian listens intently."

On Guk at least, Qeynos crafting is the only really active channel on the
"good" side.  Traders is starting to get a bit of auctions, but no discussion.
The other public channels are all ghost towns.
