Common sense is often the better part of valor.  The first time I was *ORDERED*
by the GL to gate out or camp I felt like I was abandoning my group.  I was
*so* embarassed to leave them to die.  Now I realize a Living Cleric is worth
alot more than a dead one.
Congrats on 49!
(FWIW, I was never insulted if someone wanted to wait for a better rez.  If
they found one I'd thank the higher level cleric *myself*.  You realize pretty
quick clerics are happy to help out another cleric this way:)))
