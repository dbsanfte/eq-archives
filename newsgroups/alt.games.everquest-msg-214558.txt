The dream of an hour long adventure is nice, but thus far I've
been unable to get a group within 15 minutes of logging in, in
fact within an hour sitting around just to see I got one invite,
I was afk at the time but would have had to turn it down anyway
as I wouldn't have had time to play out the adventure.

If an hour adventure means an hour LFG beforehand, and the group
breaks up after the adventure, then this doesn't increase the
play time, it decreases it; you spend more time LFG and less
playing!  Worse, I hear there's about 15 minutes between getting
your group ready to go and actually starting the adventure, what
with having to poke around looking for a dungeon adventure.

These are first impressions from someone who hasn't actually been
in a LDoN run yet, of course, a week from now I may be laughing
at this message.

But one thing I thought might work out well was the idea that I
could log in, get a group, go do something, and be done in a
short time, which fits well with my schedule this time of year,
churning out swords for the masses all fall leaves me few 6 hour
stretches where I can do a "real group".  That still seems
possible, but I might have to move to a character thats more
likely to get a group fast; 30 mage may not be all that big a
draw, and LFG time when you are on a short clock isn't pretty at
all.

Reports from LDoN beta seemed to indicate that finding groups was
easier for LDoN than for anywhere else you could think of;
logically you'd have loads of people looking for members for
groups to go do short adventures, you'd never have crowding
issues, you'd have people who specifically wanted a group fast
because the adventure itself is short, and wasting tons of time
being picky about your group construction hurts more because it
brings your play to wait ratio down.

Thus far I'd have to say the reverse seems to be true, wait time
seems to be longer, people are pickier than in somewhere like DL,
where pretty much anyone is welcome with the new group exp rules;
people going to LDoN aren't going for exp, they are going for
success in the mission, so they want the best possible group.
What comes to mind is the POJ trials, where the perfect group was
needed to get thru, and the classes less well suited to that went
begging.  Is LDoN going to turn out to be an entire expansion of
POJ Trials?

Splendid
