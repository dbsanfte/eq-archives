You skip the first two wurms?
Otherwise, that's a pretty nasty fight and can go either way--barely
win or total wipe out (although, since you're CoV factioned CR is real
easy) even if you are tank/cleric heavy.

Barring that, any double pulls would be ugly.  And while not very
familiar with HoT, I know double pulls in West wing is VERY common and
one bad runner (which I don't think HoT has), and you're screwed.
