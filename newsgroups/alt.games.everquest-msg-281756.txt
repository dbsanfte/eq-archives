I agree, but with a caveat.

I am fairly convinced that every spell or other effect that has a range,
implements that range in terms of the in-game coordinates.  So, for
example, my druid's tracking range caps out at 1300 "units".  If I'm
at coordinates X,Y,Z, I can just barely track something at X+1299,Y,Z, or
at X+919,Y+919,Z, etc.  (Note: for tracking, differences in Z don't count.
For other things, such as bard levitation song, Z does matter.)  I don't
think that changes from zone to zone.

What *might* change from zone to zone is how far away things "look" for
a given distance.  I.e., if a character is 100 units away from me, will
they look smaller or larger depending on the zone?  The reason I wonder
this is, I've noticed that when I zone into Netherbian Lair, it always
feels to me like I'm running more slowly there than I was in Nexus.  (And
no, it's not that I'm using a run spell that turns off in NL.)  That
could just be that the walls are further away so my point of reference
seems to move past me more slowly, but I've never tried to check.

But I do think that, even if 100 units seems to be closer or further in
different zones, that a given run-speed will cover those 100 units in
the same amount of time in each zone.
