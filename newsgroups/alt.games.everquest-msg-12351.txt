   I said "Wow" too when I read this.  I started a gnome warrior last
week, and have been having a blast playing her.  I'm not asking for an
Axe of the Iron Back, or even 13 coppers.  But would you mind going
into a little more detail about the earful of advice you gave him?
If it makes any difference, I've relocated to Freeport, and I am 
using a magic weapon (killed my first wisp yesterday!).  I'm not so
interested in leveling fast, I'm just in it for the fun.
