Bards get Locating Lyric at level 4.  Stringed song, though I don't know
why.... I don't see how an insturment will help the song... ah well.

Anyways, there are two things working against your bard here.  First is the
fact that the catacombs have a dungeon layout, while the song works on a
straight line.  That means, even if you know the direction, you've got to
navigate the tunnels, sometimes having to go in the opposite direction Lyric
is trying to pull you (I don't recommend singing it while you're tunnel
crawling.

Second problem, is that you've got to target the person who's corpse you're
looking for, otherwise you just find the closest corpse, player or NPC.  I
haven't had much success with typing in /target soandso.  So, unless the
bard is on a separate account, that's going to be a pain.
