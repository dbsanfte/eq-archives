For the pet question...

If the pet is the leading damage dealer in the group, it takes XP as if it
were a member.  So, if you have a 6 person group, and fight an orc for
example and the orc has 700 hit points:

member1 - 100 points of damage
member2 - 100 points of damage
member3 - 100 points of damage
member 4- 95 points of damage (OOPS!!)
member 5-100 points of damage
member 6-100 points of damage
Pet - 105 damage.

The total is 700 points, and the party outdamaged the pet by 595 points.
BUT the pet did do the most damage and therefore gets full share of the XP.

Now, if the pet did the 95 damage and member 4 did 105, the pet would only
take about 1% of the XP.

same goes for soloing.

same orc:

you - 400 damage, pet 300  you get full xp.  swap tose numbers and pet gets
50% of the xp.



charmed vs summoned...no difference except that charmed will want to kill
you when the charm breaks.
