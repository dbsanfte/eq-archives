Amazing, no?

It's too bad they stopped showing live server population numbers.
I can just see the opening of this server setting a new standard
for crowding in EQ.  Anybody else remember back when they opened
the team PvP servers?  Back then servers were busy with 1400
people on them, and quite crowded at 1800.  For the first few days
the two team PvP servers were up they were showing over 5000 on
both of them, all jammed into the newbie zones.  I remember Lanys
when it opened was pretty bad, and that was with a lot fewer people
than the team Zeks.  I'm betting that framerates will be awful
for the first few days (you think the bazaar is bad?), with a few
newbie zone crashes as well, just because of the player population.
I can envision Paludal, a couple days after server opening, with
an assortment of geniuses camping individual Fiend spawns, heh.
Should be a lot of fun.  ;)
