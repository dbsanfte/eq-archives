As far as being on the short end loot wise, AND being the only healer...All
you can say is "OOPS, it just fizzled at the wrong moment and you died.
What? you didn't see a fizzle message either?  Well I haven't seen ANY loot,
so I guess we're even after you spend what you've greedily taken on a rez."
/disband

Of course, if you haven't spoken up about not getting any loot then you have
nothing to bitch about.  get loot rules before you join a pickup group, and
if they refuse to share any loot, just remember that you have a gate spell
(yes GATE, not Succor/Evac) when things get hairy.

Ninja-looters suck.
