Heh, I usually assume the first until they prove the second or third.  So
far it mostly works, although assuming the third until they prove the first
or second has proven fairly reliable also.  But never assume someone is
inherently altruistic, they will quickly prove you wrong.

And I do have my altruistic side, such as never asking for money for ports,
giving directions to people on the street without asking for recompense, and
occasional volunteer work (not so much lately though, I've been a lazy ass).
