Actually I am becoming increasingly convinced that when you first zone
in, the list is sorted in reverse spawn order.  You'll find static
NPCs at the top of the list, and stuff that is being hunted at the
bottom.  If I have just zoned in, and there is a currently-camped
named that has just spawned, it will be at the bottom of the list.

If you have been in the zone for a while, and decide to check for a
mob that has probably been up for a long time, you will find it in the
middle of the list....

For instance, if I zone into Lesser Fay and I wonder if anybody is
hunting the corrupted brownie, I just check tracking.  If there are
brownie scouts at the very bottom of the list (or none at all), he is
being hunted.  If they are somewhere in the middle of the list, he's
not being hunted.  That has proved accurate for me also.

Also way back before they extended the tracking list with the sliding
window, it was 100% guaranteed that if I was on the trail of a new
spawn, and went LD or zoned, then that spawn would not show up in the
window (provided my tracking range included more spawns than could fit
in the window).  And if I was looking for an NPC who should have been
spawned for a long time, sometimes zoning or camping/coming back would
bring him to the top of the list.  Strange but true....  (it used to
be SO frustrating trying to track things before they added the slider
to the window!).

I've been using this as my working hypothesis for how tracking works
lately, and all the evidence I've collected seems to support it.

It also makes sense from a "stupid programmer mistake" point of view.
I think it's a bug, and they should be sorted in spawn order right
after you zone in, also.  But they accidentally did it backwards...
