It's not working at the moment. Maybe the maker will make a new version? EQ
implies this is against policy, although I don't see how they can enforce
this. Furthermore, it's not EQ's right or place to tell us how we run the
game. Actually, EQ's latest attempt to evade EQW makes it possible to run
scripts and send automated text to EQ to practice spells or whatever -- if
you notice whatever you type now goes to the EQ window. However, the mouse
does not work. I wish EQ would stop trying to bully us around.
