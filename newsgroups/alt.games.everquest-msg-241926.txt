I'm not sure about tha fabled ancient cyclops, but tha other night, me
bruther and me kilt the Allizewsaur in OOT. Tha next night, we went back ta
find him again, but instead, me bruther found tha fabled Allizewsaur when we
was separated; or, more ta tha point, tha fabled Allizewsaur found me
bruther. I watched his life go from 100% to 0% in seconds (me bruther is a
warrior of his 51st season), then heard me bruther shout 'run'. I swam into
tha ocean, turned around, and got me a good look at tha fabled Allizewsaur,
who fortunately didn't see me (so I could rez me bruther).

That fabled was red to both of us (I was 47 at the time), while the regular
one was blue to the warrior and yellow to me (level 50 according to
allakhazam). The fabled's tough, hitting the warrior for over 1k each time.

So, if'n ye're in tha ocean o' tears, be wary the fabled Allizewsaur.
