Hmm..  I run a 60 Paladin, and most of my 1-50 levels were
spent back in the days when the low opinion of Paladins
was actually deserved (the class has been improved
*immensely* since then), *and* the hybrid experience
penalty worked in such a way that inviting a hybrid
(which includes Paladins) into the group actually sucked
experience shares AWAY from everyone else in the group
(versus inviting a non-hybrid class).

Even so, I never had trouble getting groups, even from
folks who had never met/heard of me before.

So I have to wonder what the difference might be.
