Howdy Y'all,
I just bought the game last week Friday.  There were no errors during
installation, subscripting and logging in.  The problem I have is on the
character creation screen.  I cannot create my first character because none
of the eight buttons work for me.  When I click on the buttons it doesn't
take me to another screen or window.  The buttons just move in and out and
nothing happens.

The view just keeps rotating around the Newbie [1 Warrior] Loading.  The
character also goes through his practice attack moves.  The music sounds
great!  The screen shot looks great too!

I've tried to create a new character on five or six different servers with
the same results.  I also tried to log on to the test server using the file
testeqgame.exe but I get another error about a missing entry point.  I'm
also told to go to the advance patcher screen to download the files for the
test server but that selection does not show up.

I also got into chat and asked for help from the guides and they told me to
reboot and analyze the files in the advanced patcher screen which I did but
still the same problem.

I've also tried repairing the files during the re-installation and set-up.
I also have all the latest drivers for my video and sound.  Has anyone else
had this same problem?  Can anyone give me more ideas on what else to try?

Thanks in advance!
Mak
