Well, I agree that more info (on pretty much anything EQ) is a good thing. I
checked his guide, and I thought it was more than adequate, but I have to
say that for some reason (no, I don't know what it is), I liked your guide
better... or got more out of it... or something. Regardless... if I may
ask... why would you have not set out your own guide, had you found his
first? (just wondering, not hoping for a flame war, and please, you really
don't need to feel obliged to answer) I wasn't here then, obviously, so I
don't expect a full history, was just curious. It certainly is a shame for
anyone who has anything to add to the EQ community to have gone, and I can
say that, regardless of the fact that I don't know him! And I certainly do
respect the work that he obviously put into the guide, and am glad, also, to
know that you do as well.

thanks,
Darklet
