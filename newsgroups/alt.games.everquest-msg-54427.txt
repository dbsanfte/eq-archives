Don't agree there.. have and esier time soloing with mage then ranger
My ranger only has about 70wis.. I concentrated more on str and dex
So mana runs out very  quick
Plus for some strange reason I miss on hits A LOT!!
I have a good str and fairly high dex and my attack is just under 100
, like 940 or thereabouts yet I still miss all the time.
I have tried differnt weapons and still same story.
