<<<<<<Oh, and just fyi;

Clarity: Increase Mana by 4 (L29) to 7 (L48) per tick
C2: Increase Mana by 11 per tick
KEI: Increase Mana by 14 per tick

The difference is the stat boost KEI provides, which gives one a larger mana
pool.  And if you drain that large mana pool dry, the extra 3 regen per tick
isn't going to help you much if downtime is your issue.

Crash>>>>>>>

Congratulations if you have that memorized.  You're right, I didn't.  Still
doesn't remove that pesky little problem you have of not being able to explain
how it adversely affects your game experience if me and my group get 14
mana/tick instead of 4 mana/tick.  Lol, when I use your numbers your point even
looks more ridiculous!!
