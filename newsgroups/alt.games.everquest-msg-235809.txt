| I dig that you want a specific theme/adventure out of your eq experience,
| but im not entirely sure you can go to 65 on gnolls.. off hand the highest

| you find good places to level up.

The gnolls in JP are still DB to my 56 druid ... not sure when they'll turn
LB could be 57 for all I know :)
