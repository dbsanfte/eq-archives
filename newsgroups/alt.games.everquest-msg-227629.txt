Oh, I misunderstood that part. I wonder how much of our differences in
perspective have to do with the server we're on. VF being a basically
non-twink server for most people and BB being one of the oldest,
wealthiest, most crowded servers in EQ.

Idiot was my characterization not yours but you're talking about
someone so starey-eyed that they don't see the possible exploits in a
NBG system. Gullible fools maybe? <g>

Ah, I see your point. I guess the reason that one doesn't bother me is
because I've been on the opposite end of that too often. Given how
slowly I level, I'd been dragged along to things like Kael Arena or
Jugs in Sebilis around 50th lvl, DN rat tunnels and Ssra in my mid
50s, by higher level friends.  Given the loot I got on those trips
where I (low lvl shaman) was effectively useless, I find it hard to
knock NBG in a similar situation with someone else.

Massive twink would be one example, I'd guess most of us have been in
pickup groups with a twink where we let someone with shitty equipment
loot everything. 

I was thinking more of the high end though, people who have been in
high end raiding guilds for so long that (unless they're looking to
equip a twink) there's nothing for them in most camps and money isn't
worth a whole lot to them either. IME, that type of player always
favored NBG and it kinda surprised me that the people here from high
elemental or time guilds don't have that attitude.

I think the reason that I differentiated is that you imply a certain

IME, only in a group of friends.  Nobody gets together a pickup group
and says "lets hit DN because I need a quest drop from Vilefang". If
you look at some place like Sebilis back in it's heyday or BoT today,
a pickup group will take whatever camp is open. By their very nature,
pickup groups are going to hunt in crowded zones where you don't have
a huge choice of potential camps. I've also never seen the flip side,
inviting someone to a pickup group and having them interrogate me
about which camp we're doing before they join.

With certain camps, yes, but it's less about the loot. I have turned
down an invite to a CT camp for the Boots of Flowing Slime because I
wasn't about to do that camp with strangers and not have a shot at
loot. It's a horribly boring camp, shitty exp, and really the only
reason to go is for the (extremely rare) loot. Even friends have a
hard time dragging me there. 

... so I guess that even for me, NBG has it's limits. Those tend to be
exceptions though, I can think of a lot more camps that I enjoy doing
where nothing I want drops and where I have no problem with NBG.

I dunno, the tenor of your posts on the subject point towards worrying
a lot more about being ripped off than you imply here. Maybe I'm just 
misreading it, wouldn't be the first time. ;-)

Agreed. I just don't think it's as prevelant as you seem to be
implying. I also think it's usually pretty easy to figure out when it
happens.

/nod 
... and I still find it extremely rare when that happens. Although
there was a rogue in a recent pickup group that tried to call NBG on a
primiary only 1hb (orb of forgotten magic). He ended up getting so
embarrased by the group that he ran off befor the loot splt!

I think the main thing we disagree on is how often the ripoff part
occurs. I just don't see it often enough for it to be an arguement
against NBG. 

Someone gave me an ornate boot pattern last week when they probably
could've sold it for 100k (they're never for sale on BB). Makes it
kinda hard for me to bitch about people getting loot they don't
deserve <g>.
