I'm torn.

I don't miss the ride, as a matter of course, but it was nice the first 
couple times.  Only when used a lot did it become tedious.

But I liked how they stretched the world.  I was playing my dwarf 
paladin newb a couple days ago, running around on Faydwer, and 
considering some advice that I'd read, where the Shattered Warbeads I 
needed for a quest apparantly don't drop in BB anymore, but do in Misty 
Thicket.  Well, thats a long long walk, if you're assuming there's no 
POK and that no druid or wizard has leveled up enough to start a taxi 
business.

But the walk was cut in half, because I didn't have to sit and wait for 
a boat, didn't have to RIDE the boat, didn't have to worry that I might 
miss the transition from the OOT to Freeport, and end up taking the 
whole trip back and then back again!

Yeah, OK, it still would have sucked, no two ways about it.  But my 
point is, the degree to which it sucked made taking the trip a decision 
I didn't make lightly.  Now, Freeport is closer than Steamfont, heck, so 
is EC or NRo; there's no risk and no time sink, its just a short jog and 
a short conversation, repeat on the sister island, boom done.

The feeling that Faydwer is a seperate continent from Antonica is 
largely lost because of that.

I also remember riding the boat till it got near the island I wanted to 
visit in OOT, and jumping off for a short swim.  I remember too, 
swimming out into the path of the boat to climb aboard, or racing to 
meet the boat at a dock.  Some good times there... again, more in doing 
it a few times than in repeating the experience again and again.
