The only thing I know of that will cause you to not recover
any experience from a 90% rez is if your corpse had already
been rezzed or revived earlier.

I didn't see your earlier message and can't tell if that
might have been the case in your situation.

Did you get a Revive earlier to get pulled back to the zone,
thinking you could then get a 90+% rez later on the
same corpse to get your experience back?  If so, sorry,
that doesn't work.  Only the first rez/revive on a corpse
"counts", exp-wise.  And yes, the rez timer will still show time
available to rez, even if the corpse has already been
rezzed/revived once (or more) already.

Another possibility, since you mentioned having died
twice, is that by accident corpse A might have been
rezzed twice and corpse B not at all.  That too would
have resulted in no exp recovery from the second rez.
