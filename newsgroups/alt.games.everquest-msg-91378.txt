I found the projects fasinating to say the least.   They all would (will?)
be amazing achievements if they are built.  Sadly, I couldn't help thinking
to myself "I wonder how that would stand up to a airliner suicide dive" :-(

I can't see this bridge ever making economic sense.   You could run a LOT of
free ferries at the cost of just yearly maintenance on a bridge of this
scale.  Besides, we will all have flying cars by the time this thing could
be built anyway.  YES, flying cars, Dammit! Where is my flying car?  It's
already 30 years late!   :-p
