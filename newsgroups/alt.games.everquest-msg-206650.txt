Charm quests are being pursued by a lot of folks on Stromm.  Life's
different when you don't have a L65 Sugardaddy or three pushing you
through the mid levels as if they weren't there.

They get better stats than Half Elves.

Druid gets a 425hp for 200 mana heal.  Not as nice as Cleric/Shaman,
but worth getting (cast time is 4.0 vs. 3.8 cast time of GHeal).
Paladin gets a reasonably mana efficient HoT which is a very nice
combat heal, especially when you don't want to steal agro.  Haven't
looked at any others yet.

The LoY zones seem to have a great risk/reward for those working
their own way up.  They lean a bit towards the "Monty Haul" end
for veteran players, but not so much as to take away the feeling
that you're "earning" your gear.  Well, maybe it sometimes feels
a lot like "Monty Haul", even if I did have to evac after looting
with an add beating on me and half the group dead.  This mace is
awfully nice to be acquirable by a group of 5 characters, 45 - 52,
whose healer (my Druid) was at 30% mana when the mob was agro'd by
accident...  /cheer Paladin with LoH up!  This from Dulak:

Soulstripper (LORE MAGIC  PRIMARY)
1HB, 15/23
sta+4, wis+8, svP+15, hp+30, mana+15
Effect: Siphon Life (combat) (75pt lifetap) ("normal" proc frequency)
CLR DRU SHM, all races

It's too bad I get ripped so badly in melee, that thing makes me
want to beat on mobs again.

There's some good mid-level stuff drops in Gunthak also, although I
haven't seen it myself I've seen the occasional goodie linked in
guildchat.  But Dulak is the most frustrating and rewarding zone I
have played in 4 years in the game, I am looking forward to Nadox.
