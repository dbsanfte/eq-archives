History shows that jury nullification is far less often abused than
prosecutorial discretion, police discretion or judicial discretion. 
Read my article, Scapegoating the Jury, 7 Cornell Jrl. Law & Pub.
Pol'y 7 (1997), in which I compare the actions of police, prosecutors
and judges with those of the jury in civil rights murder and lynching
cases.

Funny how the feds could get convictions in civil rights cases in the
same communities in which the State got acquittals?  Different judges,
prosecutors and investigators - same jury pool.  Yet the state results
are blamed on jury nullification.  Hence the title "Scapegoating the
Jury."

We've kept jury nullification TOO quiet.  Juries do not know they have
this prerogative.  They should.  When the law is unjust or is unjustly
applied, there is only one just verdict - not guilty.
