I haven't logged into EQ for four or five months (Been playing Dark
Age Of Camalot), and notice that the game has moved on a lot since
then.

Can anyone give me a brief recent history lesson?

When I left Luclin had just been released and the bazaar was in but
not actually working.

I notice that the 'newbie levels' go up to 10 now, and new characters
get more food and drink, and there are newbie armour quests. Plus a
new UI. What else have I missed?

I play on Antonius Bayle, and when I left East Commonlands would
regularly have 200+ people, now there are only 15 or so, where did
everyone go?
