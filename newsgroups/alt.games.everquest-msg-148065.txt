}Just curious--I know there are a few bard-type good race NPCs (about
}level 10-ish) that hang out in Innothule Swamp that KOS evil races.  I
}know where at least one of them is--some guy named Derk Darkslinger or
}something like that who is immediately to the left (south) of the
}Grobb entrance; he seems to stay in one place, though, so he can
}usually be avoided.

I believe Dark Deathsinger's more like level 25.  And left is West from 
Grobb ent.

}Where are the other good race NPC's in Innothule
}located, and are they also stationary (and thus easy to avoid) or do
}they like to roam?

There's a bunch of them, they do roam, and most of them are on the same 
spawn cycle, so only one will be up at a time.  They vary from level 
8-13ish:

Bunk Odon
Fandl Arathin
Hogas Durmas
Jars Legola
Jyle Windstorm
Rell Ostodl
Tal Godin
Tann Cellus
Zepin Winsle

I am pretty sure Lynuga is on this same spawn cycle, so if you see her up, 
you should be safe from these guys.  They all wander near Guk entrance, 
usually south of the haunted tower and east of the middle of the zone.
