Ok, I can't figure this one out....

I have a win2k server receiving cable modem and then dishing it out to the
rest of the network (or *should* be), and it is also being used as a small
web&FTP server for family.  All was in place and running for about a year
when suddenly all other machines lost connectivity to the outside world.  I
hadn't touched *any* settings, as all was working well and I hadn't even
logged onto this system in almost 6 months.  I was able to see and ping the
network card that was set to 192.168.0.1 (which winICS demands) yet couldn't
see past it.  The route print command yielded no unusual results.
I've swapped PCI slots, many different combinations of nic's, end even
reformatted the server a couple times.  Same problem.
Also, I have one nic receiving the internet connection.  Whenever I set a
card to share the connection, instead of changing that card to 192.168.0.1,
it gives that addy to the other card in the system.  It does this in my
other 2 systems as well.
I've set up several home networks and have never had this problem.  Any
suggestions are greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance,
SEAN...
