The pickbringers stuff is actually vendor-sold armour - I've seen it in 
Shadowhaven on one of the vendors in the small-race ghetto. You can buy a 
full suit of useless overpriced armour much like you can buy stuff from old 
world plate-armour vendors etc. I would guess they've just screwed up an 
entry in the mob-drop tables and the wrong item is dropping instead of some 
new junk item they've added with the Luclin release (rusty ulak or 
something).
