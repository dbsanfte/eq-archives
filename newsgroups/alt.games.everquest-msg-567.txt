The other replies answer your question fairly well.

A bard can cast on the run, though, interruptions
stop songs only from being hit or having a stun effect.

Bards can sing on boats, while running, while
singing other songs, while swinging their weapons
or swappign musical instruments in and out
of their hands... in fact that is not only some
freakish ablity, but a necessity; their actual effects
are in many ways somewhat weak for thier level,
but the fact that they can walk and chew gum and
read a book and bring home the bacon and fry
it up in a pan all at the same time turn them into
power dynamos.
