My guess?

There's now more plat floating around for than there used to be...

When there WERE item trades the PP value of something was what folks used to
judge if a trade was worthwhile... "If my Yak is worth 10k, and that FBSS is
worth 12k, I need to find another item worth about 2k to trade with". Back
in the days when a Yak WAS worth 10k, not many folks had that much in loose
change... now practically every gimp and his twinkie have that much or more.
