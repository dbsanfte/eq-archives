> So, what does anyone know about Intimidate?

I can confirm what various others have posted.  I too saw the posts
about the Kick skill needing to be available, but over time I noticed
that that wasn't true, so now I just fire it off any time I'm willing
to have the mob run.  (Mammoths in Everfrost were great for this,
until they began to turn green for me.)

Though the "special attack" timer doesn't matter, it may be that my
Kick skill level affects the chance of success; I'm not sure.  (My
Kick skill sucks since I stopped raising the skill once I had better
special attacks.)  I think I saw someone suggest that the Intimidate
skill level itself was used to see if the kick lands, but that could
just have been someone's wild guess.

I'm also not sure if it's possible to distinguish all the different
"partial successes".  Certainly, if you're told "you're not scaring
anyone", that must mean the Intimidate skill itself has failed.  On
the flip side, every time it's worked I've also seen my target hit
by non-melee damage, accompanied by a message saying I kicked it for
that same amount.

If the fear spell is resisted, I still see the kick land:

> a wooly mammoth was hit by non-melee for 3 points of damage.
> You kick a wooly mammoth for 3 points of damage.
> Your target resisted the Fear spell.

In between, I sometimes see "Your target is out of range", usually
because I'm just practicing the skill while running across a zone.
And once I got "You try to kick Nexus Scion but Nexus Scion is
INVULNERABLE."  (Loading, please wait. :-)  Oddly, I don't think I've
ever gotten a "try to kick but miss" message, which is one reason I
think perhaps there's just two checks: the intimidate skill, and the
fear spell.

And yes, the skill goes up very slowly for a long time, but after a
while it starts to ramp up nicely.  I've actually had it at my level
cap more than once.  (Currently at 171 with cap of 185.)
