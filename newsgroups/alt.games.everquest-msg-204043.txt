Sorry, that should have read *sustained* DPS.

I don't know, but it pissed me off. When I started leveling my monk, I 
chose the class for some specific reasons. For one, I wanted to be able to 
solo when I could not find a group... This worked fine until the mitigation 
nerf (The Dread Day of Monk history on Norrath). Now at 54 I can barely 
solo LBs on 70% HP, whereas at 49 before the nerf I could solo DB mobs with 
less than 50% of my HP. I also wanted a dungeon crawling class, which I 
got.
