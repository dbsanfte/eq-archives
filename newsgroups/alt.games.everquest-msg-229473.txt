In the last update, Sony said "We have also added a few of the new melee
skills to the game.  These are the skills that do not use the new "opening"
system, but can be used without an opening present."

I have purchased the new disciplines and trained in them.  While I was at
the guildmaster, I checked all my skills.  I did not see any new ones.

Is there a further discussion somewhere that would tell what the new skills
are?

And while we are at it, what is "mitigation boost" and how does it help?
