The only thing I can think of offhand is that a monk
*not* on any aggro lists can FD to recover to full
HP without risk of attack. No worries about see-
invis MOBs, or re-casting invis/levitate...

Once they stand up they're fair game, of course. So,
not much of an advantage, but I can't think of any
other ability in the game which allows you to leave
your character completely unattended in a "dangerous"
zone.

Possibly some dungeons would be better for a monk
than a druid, but I haven't played in dungeons much,
and don't have a druid or monk, so I don't know.
