You will have no prob at all. You dont have to enter Paineel proper to get
top Warrens and the Stonebrunt..just take the 1st left after zone in and
then follow right wall to a cave. Then take the left there and you are in
the warrens. Get a map to go thru there. Everything should be green to you
in that zone.

Good Luck!
