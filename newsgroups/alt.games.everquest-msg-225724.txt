That's my pet peeve also.  And it might be a handy thing if there was
some kind of command like "/inviteoff" or something in "options"
where, just like you can filter out certain chat like /ooc or
/auction, you could filter out /invite--like maybe you just want to
solo for a while, or else you're just waiting for your regular
groupmates to log on, then you could turn "/invite" on again when they
show up.  (but I can't imagine Verant putting in a feature like this
since they seem to be so gung-ho about wanting people to group!)

I do have a dumb question--when you have a player on /ignore, I know
you can't see anything they say (in /ooc, /tell, etc.), but does it
also prevent you from seeing if they /invite you into a group?  If so,
that would be pretty nice, then you could just put the "go up to you
and /invite without saying anything to you first" people on your
ignore list!
