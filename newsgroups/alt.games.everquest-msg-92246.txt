I have heard great things about this game but so far I haven't been able to
get a grip on what to do. I have looked at some of the web sites out there
and got some information on basic stuff but am not sure what to do after
that. I set up a druid and then went to the farm and got my tunic now what?
Are there any newbie tutorials out there that I can print off and use to
play the game till I get in with a group of people? I paid for 3 months of
the game and by gosh am going to play it. Please can some one point me in
the right direction on how best to learn the game. I'm beginning to get the
feeling that the players don't like newbies.
