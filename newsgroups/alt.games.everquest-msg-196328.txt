    Back when Kunark was young, my buddy on The Rathe was the big
wheeler-dealer in EC. One time he'd made himself a fortune, and needed to
stagger to the bank to deposit it all. No problem, he's a shaman with SoW
and Lev.

    Except he'd lost Lev and hadn't noticed.

    Someone who was watching him said it was the funniest thing. This big
troll shaman struggled slowly to the very lip of the EC tunnel, then just
dropped dead as if from a heart attack from the strain. Just an inch is good
enough to kill you.
