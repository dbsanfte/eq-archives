My level six or so ogre warrior was getting these from the lizard
mystics in a small four-lizard camp to the left as you enter the woods
from Oggok. I generally just followed the path, taking a left at both
forks, and then veered off the path to the left just past the next hut
(or second?). The camp is just a short distance over a hill fairly
close to the edge of the zone. Sorry I don't have a /loc for you.
