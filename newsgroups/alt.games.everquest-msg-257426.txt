aye ...looks cool I can't wait .. water effects are real nice .. shame that
there's very little combat. it looks like they're running around in GM mode
as nothing was aggroing as they ran past. I like the way the UI seems to
only pop up when needed so you've got a full screen view as you're moving
around

funny though that the wood-elf runs like forest gump :)
