Well, before Kunark, most of the discussion in the newsgroup was about the
post 46 game.  The newsgroup is naturally going to end up talking about
stuff at the higher end of the game.

It could get a lot worse than that.

I remember moving my level 5 Ranger from GFay to Freeport one night, and
then spending something like three hours trying to get a bind.  None of the
people who passed through who could bind were interested in stopping to sell
a bind.

Every 20 or 30 minutes, I'd log out, log on my Wizard, and bind all the
other people who were trying to get binds, and then go back to my Ranger,
and continue trying to get a bind.  I never did get a bind that night.

The real significance of souldbinders, though, was it signaled that Verant
had finally started to realize that games are supposed to be fun, and the
universe would not implode if they took some of the mindnumbingly stupid
time sinks out of EQ.
