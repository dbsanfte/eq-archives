Dungeons in General = Better xp.

My impression is that at the lower levels the xp is definitely better when
you solo or have just a partner, but probably somewhere between the time it
becomes impossible to kill any white /cons and the time there are green
/cons that would hand you your head, soloing becomes pretty inefficient.
Just too much downtime.  With a good group you can keep the pulls constant
and have all members concentrating on one mob at a time with almost no
downtime.
