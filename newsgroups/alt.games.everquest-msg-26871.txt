Out of curiosity, why would a Good player come down from
Halas and betray another Good player just so that a bunch
of Neutrals can get revenge on him? What are you offering the
Good side that would justify their cooperation in "reigning in"
this player you hate? Considering what I've heard of the Neutral
treatment of Good, I'd imagine that any Good person you proposed
this to would laugh you off the face of Norrath.
