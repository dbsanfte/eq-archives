Of course it <isn't>.  The keys to defeating an imperialist
occupation (i.e. rule by a remote government enforced by force
of arms) are to be willing to endure and to be able to inflict
pain on the occupier.  The longer you endure, and the more pain
you inflict, the more likely the occupier is to withdraw.  If
the occupier is very strong you may not be able to prevail without
outside assistance (this is why I mentioned French aid to the
American revolutionaries in the part of my post you snipped).
If you start out with stone knives and bearskins you may not
be able to survive long enough to gain outside assistance.
Assault rifles with armor piercing ammo are gonna do a much
better job of putting a hurt on an occupier than single-shot
.22 calibre target pistols.  If you can hurt the occupiers
sodiers they are going to expend effort protecting themselves
instead of hunting you, allowing you to endure longer.  And
defeating an occupier is an endurance contest.

Bullshit.  As Lokari pointed out, the British never lost control
of their army.  More recently, despite a great deal of very public
opposition the U.S. government never lost control of its military
forces during the Vietnam conflict, nor can I recall any reports
of the South Vietnamese losing control of ARVN forces, and yet
the opposed forces eventually prevailed.

Lokari already did.
