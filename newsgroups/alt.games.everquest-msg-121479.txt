    My shawl experiences show how charmed a life a cleric leads:

Shawls one and two: I actually bought half the toes and heads with money
made ressing in GD, and was allowed to loot another quarter of them. The
rest I got blowing up giants in GD, which for me is slow but easy.
Shawl three: while heading out to EW to figure a way of finding griffons,
someone ooc'ed for a res. Turned out to be a ranger that was helping a
friend track griffons for eggs. Guess what he had to do for the res.
Shawl four: while heading out to EW to figure a way of finding the dwarf,
someone ooc'ed for a res. Turned out to be a mage in a small party that
needed to spawn him a few times. Guess what they had to do for the res. I
also showed them how the pet could act as radar, so it went pretty fast.
Shawl five: while heading out from Velk's, trying to figure out how I could
kill a bunch of shardwurms quickly to clear the non-bile carrying types,
someone ooc'ed for a res. Turned out to be a post-55 dwarf warrior that had
died in a Velk's train. Guess what he had to do for the res.
Shawl six: while raiding with my guild non-stop, wondering how I could get
the time to solo sirens for hairs *and* raise my tailoring from 160, Verant
messed up and put a smithing recipe involving storebought components in game
that made the thread the hairs made. Boom, two tries and shawl six.

    I imagine one of these days I'll be going through Siren's Grotto when
someone will ooc for a res. :-)

    ID III means all spells are boosted, remember? It would benefit you
right now.

    And some of this focus stuff is just nuts. My monk is selling his AC 12
weightless neckpiece because it's now got Mana Preservation III on it.
Before it was a focus, it was worthless - everyone preferred the Spider Fur
Collar. Now that it's a focus, a wizard is paying me 15000 pp for it - and
that's his "cautious" price, considering he thinks the focus effect could
still change on it. (Remember the named gargoyle in Tents we talked about a
while back, Meem? That's what drops this.) I've never had that much cash at
once in my entire EQ career.

    It'll fly out of your hands at 100 pp, based on my experiences.
