Uh-oh, that was a mistake.  Now I'm gonna inflict some more on you:

'/auc WTS jackass BRD, babbles on and on about resists and snares and
slows and shit, wont just stfu and play mana-song'


'/auc WTS jackass MNK, always whining about being nerfed and refuses
to tank AoW, will trade for RNG'

'/auc WTT jackass PAL for anything that can actually hurt the mobs'

'/auc WTS jackass RNG, wont do PoG and wont tank AoW'

'/auc WTS jackass ENC, already got a bot to KEI the raid and tashicide,
so this one is extra'

'/auc WTS jackass GNM WAR, dumbass thinks hes a tank, everybody knows
OGRs tank and GNMs are for punting'

'/auc WTT jackass NEC, got plenty of twitch bitch bots, looking for CLR'

'/auc WTT three assling dr00ds, a troll shaman, and an ikky monk for
a partridge in a pear tree'
