Like I said I am not missing out on anything I have done almost everything
I can with my druid. He is awesome for getting around and tracking
those rare mobs but for other uses other classes are simply better.

Being a jack of all trades is good at the lower levels but being a specialist
is the power at the high end. Some of this is getting better with some
of the re-balancing going on but I still think the game is broken at the
high end.

Yes druids are decent on grind groups but if you have a choice to
play different classes for those grind groups then the druid is way
down on the list.
