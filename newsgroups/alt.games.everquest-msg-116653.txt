It really is that simple. Don't bug people directly, even if you are
face to face with a known high-level druid. Make it known through
/shout or /ooc (I'm not such a purist that I much care which) that you
are looking for a service, what you can pay (or can't depending on
circumstances) and let them come to you. This would eliminate the
majority of the negativity regarding this topic.
