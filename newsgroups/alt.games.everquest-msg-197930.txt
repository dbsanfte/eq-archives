Gack, 1977 is when it started? That's why I was clueless about the exact
dates...I was born the same year. :(

*raises hand happily* Just can't find a good group in my county.  Problem
about the SF Bay Area is, even if a town is theoretically close, all the
water, hills, and narrow roads mean it takes a while to get anywhere.

I miss it...the campaign I was in charge of was mostly women, so as a DM I
could draw pages of clothing styles for a given region, and it was
actually used by my players.  The adventures could have all kinds of
emotional character development and they ate it up.
