I remember a long time ago there used to be an EQ program that let you 
wander around the zones ( old world ) and see what they looked like. I 
was wondering if anyone knew where it could be found, or if there is 
something better/newer that does the same thing.

What I want to do is record some of the old zones but with the revamp of 
Paw, mistmoore and others I can't go into them anymore.
