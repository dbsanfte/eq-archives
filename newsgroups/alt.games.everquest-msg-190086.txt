Thanks. I kind of figured it was normal but then I rean into a guy last
night that was a level 10 and had only been playing 2 days and he was decked
out in some nice armor. That left me scratching my head.

Overall, people seem to be pretty friendly and helpful so far. My main
problem as a barbarian has been that you can't gain experience in the main
area of Everfrost Peaks after level 5 or so but you get killed fairly easily
if you head out on the tundra plains or into Black Burrow. Regardless, the
game is quite addicting and loads of fun.
