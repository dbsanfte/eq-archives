Now if they would only put in a couple different Red messages; I'd love to
know if a mob is three to five levels higher than me as opposed to six or
more...
currently a mob could be 59 levels higher, or three levels higher, same message.

Since as a druid my primary targets are all red, its always anybody's guess as
to whether I can handle them until after I've tried a few.

Will be a lot more important when Luclin comes out, if you look at the
proposed spell lists there are a lot more group buffs.  Handy for
raids, too, since you'll be casting on six PCs per cast instead of 5 plus
refreshing your own buff.

Aye, taking away the ability to drop coins seems like overkill.  Why not a flag,

set at no drop by default, but fixable to confirm or always, like they have with

items?
