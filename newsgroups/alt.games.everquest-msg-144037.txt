Heh . I dont have my epic on my monk though I do have the robe done.

For haste I use
Fist of lightning
belt of marvelous visions

My primary hand is usually wurmscale fistwraps though I do have 5 or so
other weapons that sometimes go in that slot instead. Every upper luclin mob
drops a decent to good monk weapon and there just arent that many monks.

And for martin he is sorta right. My 70 dps was out of memory I havent
actually parsed anything in awhile. If anyone has some recent parsings post
them :p
