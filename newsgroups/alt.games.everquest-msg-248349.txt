I sometimes have the same problem on my machine: a winxp pro box. Alt-enter does work, only after
pressing it several times and also doing a ctrl-alt-del also helps to get the alt-enter to work. I
have to use the switch to on the task managert to get the mouse to shake loose sometimes. others it
just takes an second alt-enter to get the eq back to full screen to free it up.  Been having this
problem since I went to xp pro.
