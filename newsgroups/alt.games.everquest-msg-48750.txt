I've used Diamond Cable 56k modem dial up at first with EverQuest in March
1999 when EQ was released, my phone bill was over �100 a month playing
EverQuest at 25p per hour no lag.

Then I changed to NTL World when Diamond cable was bought out & had the
terrible lag & cut-offs for a while but cheap phone bills =)

Then I used AOL Online at �14.99 a month & good stable connection most of
the time, except for when on massive raids the lag was Terrible!

Now today I just got NTL Broadband, which is 512k cable modem, it absolutely
rocks, its faster than speedy Gonzalez hehe, anyway I'm the happiest EQ
player at the moment, so I'm off to play EQ again lol!!

Take Care,
