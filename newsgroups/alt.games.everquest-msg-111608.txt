2pp a stack seems to be a good guideline price.  5pp a stack is high, and
10pp a stack just silly.  A vendor will, IIRC, sell a stack for around 2gp,
but its a pain farming vendors and its nice to have a way to feed the
newbies
who actually go out and work for a living some cash, without encouraging
the idle beggars

5pp to 10pp a stack, just as an aside, is a good price for leather
padding...
someone who is getting exp from the spiderlings and pelts can also rack up
100pp or so, enough for a full suit of banded, and get their tailoring skill

started at the same time.
