Well I'll blow our trumpet...Wyrd Angles fits your description.

Our website is wyrdangles.moonfruit.com and there are contact details
there, we are also listed on www.guildmagic.com which should give you the
demographics of the guild....look both with and without alts as the
demographics do change....however many alts are played nearly as much as
the mains.
