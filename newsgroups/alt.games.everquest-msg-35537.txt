Let's say you're from, oh, South Carolina, and proud of it.

Someone then goes on to trash all South Carolinians (*shrug*) saying they're
all stupid lazy rednecks who couldn't find a computer if it was stapled to
their ass.

You'd feel compelled to defend yourself, and other South Carolinians, eh?

I've seen many, many posts from ryouseika and this is the first time I read
that she's gay (I think... may have gone under the radar previously).  Doesn't
exactly seem to me that she's standing on a soap box and screaming to the
world.  In other words, it's you who are making the big deal out of it.

As to the relevance to EQ... umm... there isn't any.  Since it makes no
difference if my groupmates are black, white, hispanic, male, female,
divorced, single, married, mammals, reptiles, marsupials, some or all of the
above, it doesn't matter if they're gay.
