>The necro **IS** a healer... 

	Well, I can't agree with *that*.  2-3K over the course of a minute
is useful, but any reasonably high level mob will hit for 2K (and
more) per round.  

>Backup Mezer (Using Terror), 

	Screaming terror only works to like 55...  It's a real shame
that there's no upgrade to that one...

>Backup tank (via his pet at LEAST, If not himself... yes, necros can 
>directly tank if defense skills are up), 

	Hmmm, even with conviction the necro pet is a pretty poor tank.
(IMHO).  Tap tanking is very inefficient, and if you get a few
inconvenient interrupts you're toast.  Yes, it does work but I think
there's a reason necros kite :-)

>Backup nuker 

	Eh.  They nuke better than clerics I guess... :-)

>Snarer 

	Yup, snare is good... Too bad it breaks mezzes though...
