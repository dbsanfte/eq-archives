Correct me if I'm wrong, people, but isn't it quite likely that the
player's logs will show things in a different sequence from those kept
on the server, simply due to network lag/latency?

Other than that, I have to agree with the others here. Your recounting
of second-hand information is naturally going to suffer from a bit of
sympathetic flavoring when it was most likely sugar coated for you by
your friend in the first place.

Btw, I don't think that a warning would ever be placed on someone's
account for petitioning unless they *really* asked for it. That's just
too silly to believe. If they really did got a warning, then they most
likely got unruly with the GM.
