This is probably a test to see how well a downloaded expansion format is
received and used.  My guess is that it is a way to test the market for
future expansions for EQ, EQ2 and SWG.  I think it offers some benefits.
Downloaded expansions take care of all the pissin and moaning from guilds
that have European members that can't get expansions at the same time as
everyone else, allows player instant gratification (which we all enjoy) and
allows them to produce smaller expansions that don't have to be as earth
shattering as Luclin or POP to get people interested in them.  Dont' know
what the price will be, but they can market expansions this way for about
$10-15 a pop because they don't have all the over head and markup involved
in retail distribution. Sounds like smart marketing to me.
