I was on tonight when my server crashed (too many people were zoning into W
Freeport for rumors of a GM event/war, a Vah Shir was adding to this by
piling up corpses by a Freeport guard.
    I was trying to see if the server was back up (without logging back onto
the game) and wasn't able to.  I can only find the page with the patch
updates (which are all OUTdated).
    Can someone post a link to the server updates page so I can add to
favorites?  Or what about software that monitors that for you?
