    Our 59 bard in D2 had one of these on last night. She was just mezzing,
not charming, so the minus INT was never an issue.

    It's tough to re-teach a group what to do when you have a bard instead
of an enchanter. Killing the lowest HP mobs first, especially casters, just
doesn't seem right. ;-)
