Some of us have an innate correction mechanism that attempts to fix
inbreeding, I only find myself attracted to slightly built asian girls who
are about as physiologically, psychologically and genetically disimilar from
my lumbering, twitching and mumbling anglo/saxon/celtic/mongrel genetic
refuse pile you can get.

I think it is my genetic makeup's last frantic attempt at trying to throw
off the shackles of the rampant insanity in our family tree before the
drooling tongue biting stage finally sets in.

Of course, there is always a hitch, it takes more than one person to
understand the value of genetic diversity to get any benefit from it ...
