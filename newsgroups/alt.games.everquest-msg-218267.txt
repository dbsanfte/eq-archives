I don't want to sound like an idiot, but I would like someone to give me
advice on AoE grouping techniques, please.
If you can post/e-mail any information that would be helpful, any link to
website where I can read up.
I am a 52 level enchanter, and really have done a lot that available to my
class from (mostly) working as traffic cop/ haster to charm soloing (which
was exciting and lots of time lethal). But I have never tried an AoE and I
read a lot about it and the amounts of XP and fun it brings. And I couldnot
find the precise info anywhere yet.
I would appreciate the group set up, spell set up and any ifno on zones
where I can do it. I probably could do it myself through trial and error but
it could be costly to myself and people who agree to group with me.
Thanks in advance.

Woland,
the Enchanter on Lanys T'Vil
