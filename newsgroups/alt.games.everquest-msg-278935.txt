We tend to have at least 3 and sometimes 5 enchanters so getting the
horde locked down isn't an issue really.  Bard kiting is/could be out
since the only bard we have is botted by the lead cleric and raidleader.
We usually only have one monk along and while we also have 2 SKs they are
botting a cleric each so that could get dicey.  I'll toss off the 
suggestions given here and see how they fly.
