It seems a urinating contest is in order here.

First off, let me repeat something for you.  I want to know more about the
game before I commit to spending my hard earned money on it.  I don't know
about you, but I DO work for my money (I'm not afraid to admit it).  I'm not
about to go out and spend $25+ on software that was intended to be played
online in a multi-player capacity, which would put me out more money
monthly, if the game's not going to "get it" for me.

As far as you giving a damn about my inquisitiveness, you have options.  One
of them is to not read what I post.  Another, should you choose to read what
I post, is not to reply unless you have something to contribute.

What, exactly, have I ATTEMPTED to start here?  What are you going for?  If
you want, kill file me.  It's not going to hurt me one bit to have what
seems to be the village vigilante not read or reply to what I write.

Sound simple enough for you?  I hope so.
