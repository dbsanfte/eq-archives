    No kidding. Bertox used to be just as easy to blow (you just had to
click on the chair down, and the event started), and they fixed it. So why
not fix this?

    As of last night our competition (both of them) had done the entire High
Priest cycle once, so I guess it isn't 'leet any more. ;-) Carprin and his
guards all have to die within a very short time. We usually pull the guards,
offtank them down to 10% or so, then pull Carprin. When Big C gets low,
waste everything, guards first. All the later spawns are just normal "kill
this please" stuff, although as you'll see some of them pack quite a
whallop!

    No NPCs mention it that I know of. It's like another encounter in
another PoP zone, which for now I can't talk about because it's still "us
only": you just try stuff until you figure out what you did different. Oh
no, I've said too much!

    Everyone on my server has done him, so I can talk about this one freely!
There's a bunch of those non-KOS spiders walking into the room where he's
sitting. According to the NPC that flags you, they carry power to the
machines. Cut off the flow of power, and the Behemoth will awaken to see
what's going on. There's I think nearly 40 of the spiders up at once. When
one gets into the room, it despawns (and respawns in one of the surrounding
rooms) and someone at random in the room takes 4 K damage. If you prevent
the spiders from entering the room for a short while, like 5 minutes or so,
Behemoth wakes up and attacks. Like I said, if he leaves the room he warps
and it's over.

    And one general hint for all of PoP: if you know the name of what you
are going to fight, you might want to head to Lucy and do a search on that
name or part of that name. The spell designer wasn't very imaginative when
naming the AoE's on mobs.
