He was only succeeding because people LET him succeed.  And the sad
fact is that people just need to learn how to deal with assholes.
True in game, true in life.

I got a 49 druid and there are very few places that I won't go because
of beggars.  About the only place that really irritates me is the
Faymart Wizard spires.  This is the only time that I ever actually use
my Treeform spell anymore.  :-)

And as for people asking for SoW, I usually have no problem if they're
standing right there and ASK me for a SoW.  If I'm busy, or just in an
ungracious mood, I'll simply say "No" or "I'm busy right now".  I've
had people whine and beg, but trust me, this does not get them a
damned thing.

I've got one person on my ignore list, and this was a level 15 druid
that asked me to powerlevel him.  I told him no, I'm sorry, I'm busy
doing other things.  (Ironically enough, at the time this was even
true.)  As soon as I tell him this, he starts going off on how his
level 60 necro is going to make my life hell and how he's going to KS
me on anything I fight and blah blah blah blah blah. 

After 5 minutes of semi-literate blather, I added him to my currently
empty /ignore list.

But what I did NOT do is leave the zone.  I refuse to let assholes
push me around.

Agreed 150%.  And is sucks.  People just have to learn how to not let
these people get to them.  I re-reiterate, such is life, such is the
game.
