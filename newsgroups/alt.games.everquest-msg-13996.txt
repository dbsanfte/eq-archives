i remember hearing that they increases the weight of them and made a new
Deluxe kind? if this is true how come my character with a Pre nerf kit and
my other one with a post nerf kit have the same identical kit did the patch
change my pre nerf one? or did they not change it on every server (the 2 are
on different servers one pvp one not)
they both are large 10 slot giant and weigh 3.0
