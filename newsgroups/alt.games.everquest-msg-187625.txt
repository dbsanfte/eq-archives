I play on one machine with XP Home - no trouble, one machine with XP Pro -
no trouble, Win2K - no trouble.

So I see no difference in any of the machines. The XP Pro machine has no
sound card, so that may be something, but I doubt it. The XP pro is also
using an USB nic.

I would guess people who have XP troubles are running older drivers or did
an upgrade which does not replace all the drivers.
