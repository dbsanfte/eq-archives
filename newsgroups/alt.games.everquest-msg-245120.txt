Aye... but i thought your intent was to get all people to play
casual.. to 'level the field' so to see so the end game didn't get as
far out from the casual player.

10 hours a week? Good lord. Can anything be done in 10 hours a week on
EQ :>. I thought you were looking at something in the 200-300 hr
range.

Oh.. you'd be surprised.. challenge like that.. you'd still have
people vieing to get 65 in only those 10 hrs a week and being the
first and fastest guild to take down AoW in *only* 10 hours a week..
and omg we did it in 2 months! Still.. i wasn't expecting the time to
be that constrained. As per the question of the 3-box.. you'd have
players on other servers.. and flop over to fill in your 10 hrs a week
with as much advancement as possible.

Just consider it something for guild memebers to do on an off raiding
day on a normal server :>. After all.. how many went and toyed around
with Discord when it came out. Its basically the same principle.. a
challenge server.

Now that would be interesting. With say 40 hours a week.. you only get
so many spawns that are up, but there is much more time a month
available. I could definately see a guild rotation based on weeks
where a guild decides whether they're going to be on in week 1, 2, 3,
or 4 of the month.

I still think for most people it boils down to a challenge server. I
do think it would alleviate a lot of the congestion and competition
for spawns.

Hope it works out for you.. but EQ tends to have ties closer than La
Cosa Nostra. :> Once in, you cannot leave, no matter how hard you try
