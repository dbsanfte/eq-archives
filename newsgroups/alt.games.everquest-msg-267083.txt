What makes eq1 the default? .everquest doesn't argue for either. Sure 
historically 1 was the default, because there was no contest. But 
now...? What makes it the default now? Historical momentum? Group 
consensus seems to have shifted it to 2. Perhaps we ought just embrace 
it. 

If this were the alt.us.president group, I'd expect the topic to shift 
from Actor to Snoop to Lecher to Idiot as time progressed. Why shouldn't 
the progress of time pass here too? Especially if it proves to be the 
case that EQ1 chatter is dying out anyway.
