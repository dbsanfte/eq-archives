I do many tradeskills, I am intimately familiar with how much of a pain in
the butt they are.  I am also intimately familiar with what a time and money
sink they really are.  In all honesty, if you do get lucky enough to be one
of the early folks to get in on some new awesome tradeskill item, you can
rake in some dough, but, more likely, you will be following on their
coattails, and not do so.  Personally, I get some kind of perverse pleasure
out of the tradeskills, and continue to slowly work them up.  What can I
say?  I'm a masochist.
