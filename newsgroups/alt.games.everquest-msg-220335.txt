Least he bought you a drink! (hehe)

My gender RL is not a secret within EQ, people who play with me know,
but, fortunately for me, most people on eq dont seem to believe I want
ot cyber with them. unless there are some animations Im missing, there
is NOTHING in eq that suggests to me that cybering is a fun eq
pasttime..

Lets see

We dont wash
We eat and drink and dont go to the lav - do we just go in our armor?
We dont wash still
We run everywhere we must sweat but we dont wash
We kill stuff, we get diseased, we get resurrected after a while of
decompositing, we go on withtout a thought
We wear armor we found on things we killed, we dont wash it
We EAT things we found on the floor in the most dankest of places, we
dont wash it
We DRINK stuff we find lying around too, eww!!
We never have tetness (sp) jabs and we are constantly mauled by half
the population we dont know where they've been
We dont wash!

We must stink.. there would be so many rampent diseases,  and he finds
this a turn on??
