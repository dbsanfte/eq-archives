Very little use firsthand. Most of it goes to outfit twinks. There are some
items that are tradable and usefull , you can tell those items by the
500,000 pp price tags on them. Also these items tend to dissappear out of
the bazaar at an alarming rate. (took me 2 days to collect the 400,000pp for
an elder holgresh beads and by that time both offered in bazaar where sold
:(

Most high end geared people have completely exchanged no drop equipment 10+
times. The last time they could buy a real upgrade was years ago ;)

Also in some zones high end hunting is very profitable and quick. You
basically get the choice of raiding in places that will offer many small
upgrades for people or several substantial upgrades. This is a source of
internal guild tension. New people will prefer those places with a great
many quick small upgrades (NTOV, the luclin shard key place i can never
remember the name of , time) , while older characters will be looking for
mobs that take lots of effort but only drop one or two really good items .
