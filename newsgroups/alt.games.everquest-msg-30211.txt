Myself, I went LD with a mountain giant craig in front of me and a goblin
bonecaller bashing on my back. Not an enviable place for a 30th lvl warrior
with 2 bubs of HPs left to go LD. I was screaming in group for a heal,
turned and looked and noone was there.......then the mobs stopped
attacking...DOH.
