If tanking,  I agree monks would need more heals.  As DPS, I have needed to
heal much less than any other melee as the shed aggro so well.  I would hate
to see a monk as MT.  With the others (except rogues) you have to hope the
Tank can quickly reacquire aggro.  Also, the mend ability also cuts down on
the need to heal them as long as it's available.  I do see myself healing
monks less than, say, a Ranger, a Paladin or a SK in the same role.
