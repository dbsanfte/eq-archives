Druid epic is a big difference.  I was in a guild that did not have 
enough people under 52 to hit Naggy/Vox, and did not have the forces 
available on a moments notice to take down the other dragons, assuming we 
even could take them.  This meant that people who needed scales had to do 
the level 52 limit pickup raid crap for ages.  A lot of people are in 
that situation.

We did help each other with epics at every point where it was feasible, 
and finished off many epics, at least one of each class, many in the case 
of classes where the guild could really do the fights.  For Paladins, 
Bards, and Warriors though, it meant that they had to get their own 
scales, up until near when I left the guild, when we were able to start 
on Kunark dragons.

As for 12 hour camps, you have to do those for some epic, even longer 
camps.  The cleric epic comes to mind in particular, it has insanely rare 
spawns that you just have to get seriously lucky on.
