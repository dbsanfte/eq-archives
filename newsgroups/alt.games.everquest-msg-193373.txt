When you had to learn them slowly, it was just harder to find groups,
coordinate actions, and make friendships, as far as I could tell.
There was a bit of "acting out what you want" type of roleplaying,
but it wasn't very successful, as far as I could tell.  People used
/chat tell a lot.

I dunno, I still just don't see the advantages, but I'm keeping an
open mind.
