Well, I think they might both be merchants.  Except if a few really rare,
quest related cases, merchants just poof when someone kills them.  No
experience, no treasure, no corpse, just big whomping faction hits (and not
always even that.)  This is to discourage people from attempting it, since
it would pretty well screw up someone's day to discover that the one
merchant on this side of the continent that they can sell to or need items
from is being camped for "phat lewt."
