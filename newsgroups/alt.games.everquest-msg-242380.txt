I've done it several times now, and SO FAR, anything I put in the shared bank 
or shared plat slot hasn't poofed in between deleting the character and 
making the new one.

It isn't guarenteed, of course; the safest method to transfer stuff to your 
new character is still to enlist the help of someone you trust and get them 
to hold your stuff.  But I've never personally had any problems using the 
shared bank.
