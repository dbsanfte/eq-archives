I in turn didn't mean to be short with you.  You should perhaps though
also be aware that many of us who have been playing since before the
can-you-port-me-two-feet-over-in-that-direction? phase of EQ find it
irritating that so many people have no idea how to get anywhere these
days without having their sorry butts ported there.  People asking for
ports to an adjacent zone is not at all uncommon.  If you are not one
of those severely geographically-challenged types, then my apologies.

You're right.  Please and thank you work wonders.  Just tonight
someone came up to me and said, "May I please have a sow?" and I was
so pleased with him for spelling it out and everything that I buffed
him up the wazoo.

As far as offering donations for SoW or a bind, I personally don't
expect it, though I expect a thank you.  Others may feel differently.
As has been said, the offer never hurts.
