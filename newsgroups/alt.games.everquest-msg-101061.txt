Exactly as much tongue-in-cheek as the original post. But, like most
things amusing, based in fact.

I play a (currently) 36 Warrior. And I'm damned good at it. Oddly, I
experience the opposite problem the original poster indicated. I'm
typically the puller for my group (almost exclusively pick up groups)
and always ask for mana reports. I like to have the Cleric at 60,
Shamen and Druids at 40 (assuming there is a Cleric, if not, then 60),
Enchanters at 50 (I really don't know the mana requirements for
Enchanter spells, so arbitrarily chose 50). I don't care what the
other casters have. But I often don't get the chance to wait for
casters to have as much mana as I like. It's tough to stand there when
the five other members of the group are chanting "What do we want? A
pull! When do we want it? Now!". I swear it happens all the time. The
whole party is at 50% health, the casters are 20% or lower mana, and
they're all screaming "Pull! Pull! Pull!". So I pull. I may not be
good at math, but I know that 5 people screaming pull + 1 Warrior
sitting on his ass = 1 Warrior LFG.

I'm beginning to modify my take on Wizards mana. I have learned,
through careful observation, that whenever the Wizard stands up, a
monster dies. I don't know how much mana the "Stand Up" spell takes,
but I'll be paying more attention to the Wizard's mana in the future.

Mages? What do these guys do, anyways? They've got their little
blow-up dolls which are kinda neat. They can summon arrows for me - I
like that. And bandages. But I've never seen one get aggro. This tells
me that they aren't doing anything to piss off the mobs. Everyone else
gets aggro sooner or later. The healers, the nukers, the
buff/debuffers, the other melee's. Even Druids and Rangers gets aggro.
I guess that mobs just aren't that upset when someone orders a loaf of
bread.
