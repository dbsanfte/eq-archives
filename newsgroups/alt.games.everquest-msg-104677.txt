Just a few buffer blues into 40.  Any info on soloing her would be very
appriciated.  Right now, she's sitting in Dreadlands, pouting because she
hates the entire continent of Kunark (it was nearly impossible to convince
her to stay put in LoIM, and she gave up on the Overthere quite quickly, and
ran off to the Thurg Mines, where she could solo, but it was slow and
painful).

The reason she has to solo is that my work schedule does mean and nasty
things to my off time (which changes location every week, as I change
shifts), so grouping is rarely a worthwhile pursuit.
