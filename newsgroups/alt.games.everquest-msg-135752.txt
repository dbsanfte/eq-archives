People have been saying that for around 2 years.
It sure is taking its time being that.

I doubt it. Its too pvp which means that a big 
guild could control an area and just jump people, because
they can. Yet its mostly still a PVE game, you gain prowess
via monsters still. This makes an odd mish mash which I don't
think will work.

Heard that before I think. I'll believe that when I see it
too.

How do you roleplay a player locator?
Ahaha that is a bit much. Bounty hunting makes
sense, if you'd have to make a report to a guard or something.


>greatly enhance player accountability

In a game based on PVP. So what is the point?
Seems like an oxymoron to me. 

"Hey, lets make a PVE mmorpg where
players can "control" cities and base it all
on PVP yet put in so much "police" code that
no one will pvp unless attacked or something so
it ends up being kind of a copout and a typical PVE
where people go and level up but some people COULD cause
trouble and PVP if they felt like it and then be hunted.. ooh fun!"

"OKAY!"
