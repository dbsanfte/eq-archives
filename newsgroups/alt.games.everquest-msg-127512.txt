Bullshit.  Pure and simple.  You are selling an account that you have no
right to sell.  You are violating the EULA which you agreed to every time
you played.  And, you say, you are only trying to get back money for all the
time you spent playing.  Isn't this a game?  You didn't get your money's
worth for the leisure time you spent playing?  Or did you look at this as a
business (in which case SONY/VI may very well have a fraud case against you,
but that's for the lawyers)?  Basicically, you are full of shit.  You want
someone to pay for your account else you would just sell the software for
what you paid (or less, as it is open) rather than tryinf to get a premium
price for the ACCOUNT.


>Hate me all you want :P

It's hard to hate a moron.  It's more pity I feel for your parents at having
attempted raising you.
