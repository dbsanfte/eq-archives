hehe that applies to so much in life.  Stuff that makes perfect sense to
folks who it makes perfect sense for rarely understand why it makes no
sense to those it makes no sense to.  I've been on both sides of that
equation often enough to just do what I do and not really worry to much
about how others perceive it.  I don't waste my breath trying to
convince folks not to shout it out and I don't bother to give em a
reply.

As for your example my response might likely be more along the lines of
: Hope that works out for you.

That is my noncommittal response to such unsolicited remarks from
strangers.  It covers anything from the best news to the worst news
without getting overly involved in the lives of strangers who are trying
to get me involved in their lives for no other reason than the fact that
I happen to be there when they decide they need to involve someone. 
Friends I get excited for, strangers don't get that same response
because I'm just not that involved.  Helped two friends pass over into
60 this weekend and I assure you that after several days or banging on
the exp I was pretty enthused for both of them when they made it but
someone shouting out "ding 60" is just another dinger to me.
