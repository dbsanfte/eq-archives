Well, be aware that that is just on the lower end items.   When you start
getting into finished products, it's less and less true.   Tier 1 finished
products like a backpack (level 5) or robe (level 9) seem to sell for 75'ish
copper.  It's not hard to run up more than that to produce it, even if you're
only paying for water and fuel.    Not a lot more, but if you break even,
it'll be only barely.

And once you're over level 10, then you will not be selling to a vendor for a
profit, since you *can't* do your own subcombines.   You do however get a new
way to come out ahead, since you can get commisions from your tradeskill
society.    The one I did yesterday (Produce 10 shaped tailored threadbare
pants) paid 48 silver for the batch.
