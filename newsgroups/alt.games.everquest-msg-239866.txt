I've read this whole thread and love the idea that kids are getting involved
with the game.  Since they are being supervised "most" of the time, maybe it
will bring a more friendlier atmosphere in some of the zones.

My nephew is 11, sits and watches me play for hours.  I can see me getting
him an account soon, he plays EQ on his sony playstation at his house.
Guess we are starting off another generation of EQ addicts.
