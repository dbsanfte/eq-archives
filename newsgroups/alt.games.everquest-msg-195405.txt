Ok Tim, but you are talking a L55 fighting dragons.  KEI actually
doesn't mean all that much to you, because in its absence you would
expect to have c2 (11/tick), and quite possibly a BL mana regen
buff as well, making KEI a rather small incremental upgrade to your
mana regen in a group or raid situation.  A L55 on a raid is not
reasonably comparable to a L25 soloing/self-PLing, which is what
the "KEI hurts the game" argument is all about.
