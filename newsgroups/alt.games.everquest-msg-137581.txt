    I have a distinct advantage, and I leverage it. You see, my tailoring
skill is 168 - I get skill-ups off acrylia studded armour. But because I own
the shears off Shei (+15% Tailoring), my effective skill is 193 - above the
trivial point for acrylia studded armour. So for someone skilling up, my
fail rate is as low as can be. Add to that I get my pelts for free
(guildmates camping the Dawnshroud Peaks lucid shard) and farm acrylia every
night (I help guildies get their Maiden's Eye shard, I loot all acrylia) and
I can afford, if the price on a 10 WIS cloak is 2000 pp, to sell for
1500-1700 pp. The night before last I noticed someone dumping cloaks onto
the Bazaar for 950 pp each - less than half the "going price". Which didn't
bother me, as that same night I sold a pair of Acrylia Reinforced Tunics for
2000 pp each. My 50%+ success rate on Reinforced means I can always shift to
them if some crazy rich person skilling up really tries to depress the
market. ;-)

    As a side note - 21000 pp in three nights of selling. I've never had
21000 pp in all my time playing Everquest. DWARVES LOVE BAZAARS!

    If it makes you feel better my lizard monk is male. (I even made him a
AC 12 STR/INT 3 all saves 3 weight 0.5 jet black leather look bracer last
night - WTB mind worm hides!)
