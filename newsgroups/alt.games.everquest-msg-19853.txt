Personally, as a Magician, I've never bothered begging for teleports.  Even
without Jboots, I figure I can get there about as fast on my own, given
that Druids and Wizards generally don't like being accosted for TP duty. 
My groupmates are often somewhat baffled by this.  "Ok, we'll all meet in
LFay and do Unrest tonight.  I'll just find us a Druid to port and... Where
are you going?"  Me - "Boat.  Meet you there."  Oddly enough, I usually get
there at around the same time, since it either takes them forever to get a
porter, or everyone suddenly remembers that they need to run to the bank
just after they find one.
