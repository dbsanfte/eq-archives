You are proof of group one. You assume nothing is wrong with how you do
things.  At the same time, you believe that they should fix it this
instant.  Problem is, nothing is ever perfect for every user, and nothing
can be fixed in a jiff just cause you bought it.  Today alone in the chat
room, every other person griping about the 1018 problem said, "I thought it
said they fixed the 1018 problem."  The Patch message says the following:

"We *think* we've fixed *many* of the issues that were causing 1018 errors.
At the very worst players should be able to log back in faster now"

Yet users out there who complained with that statement don't READ the
'think' and 'many' and just read it as:

"We've fixed the issues that were causing 1018 errors."

That all they see.  Some follow up with the "Fix the 1018 errors!"  Acting
as if it was flipping a switch.  This is a problem of mentality of the
user.  No where have I stated that Verant doesn't have problems, this is
the type of mentality I am describing of the majority of the consumers out
there when they pitch a fit towards Customer Service.

You don't need to poll when you hear people in Guild Chat, in OOC, in the
chat room, in Shouts asking the same stupid question that is mentioned in
the MOTD that has been up for over several days.  There are even some
people who go, "It was?" or didn't bother reading it.  When it comes to
having repeatedly stating the answer to the same question, it becomes a
blaring fact that most people do not read it unless pointed to it.

No, just you who flames without a clue.  QA for a system setup that has
over a hundred possible combinations of hard, software, OS and drivers and
expect to have it work for everything is near impossible.  As for QAing
stuff thrown in, yes, they can do, but then, with 150 some zones, with over
30 or so mobs in each zone, hard to check everything in a timely manner.
Throwing it on the test server might help, but then no guarentees
everything will be caught there either.

No, it doesn't absolve them of the bugs they make.  But it does show
players in general whine about crap that is already know and being worked
on.  But then, Ed has a problem figuring out how things work to begin with
and flames without a clue too, so why bother explaining it either.
