When meleeing with any of my weapons, I have noticed alot of misses.  What
can I do to correct this?  I've been told it's my Dex, Atk, you name it...

I don't have my current stats available, but I know they aren't really
crappy or anything and I just thought of asking this on a whim.  I am
however, using a Soulstripper for primary, have Book of Obulus for secondary
and Fine Antique Velvet Rose for range.  Any suggestions for how I might
upgrade too?

Thanks in advance,
