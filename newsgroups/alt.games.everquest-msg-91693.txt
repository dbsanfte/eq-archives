Temple of Veeshan has 80% of the *top* mobs in the game.  A single zone. 
All right there.  No transportation issues.

Then there's a single uber mob in various other zones.  A few zones with
multiple uber mobs (Ssra Temple, Kael).

Basically, nothing compares to ToV.  I personally think that zone was the
single stupidest design ever.  The zone graphic design is great, but making
it ultra high level with 80% of the hardest mobs and 80% of the best loot,
all in a *single* zone was simply idiotic.

There's some hope that Vex Thall, that no one has legitimately gotten into,
will be ToV 2.0.  Don't hold your breath.
