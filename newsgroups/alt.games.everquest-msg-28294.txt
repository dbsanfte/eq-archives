Weaponshield

THE DISCIPLINE OF WEAPON SHIELD
Class: Ranger
Level obtained: 60
Duration: 20 seconds.
Re-Use Delay: 72 minutes.
Re-Use Delay at Level 60: 72 minutes.
Discipline Description:

This diciplines causes the Ranger to parry all melee attacks.


DEFENSIVE DISCIPLINE
Class: Warrior
Level obtained: 55
Duration: 3 minutes.
Re-Use Delay: 15 minutes.
Re-Use Delay at Level 60: 10 minutes.
Discipline Description:

The warrior takes less melee damage but also deals less. This will not reduce
damage taken by the warrior from any form of magic, damage shield, or weapon
proc. This discipline lasts for 3 minutes and has a base reuse time of 15
minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the warrior gains
additional levels.


The warrior discipline lasts 15 times as long, and can be reused 7 minutes
after it wears off (at level 60).

Against 200k hp mobs, 20 seconds is just not enough, and then the ranger is
dead and it's wreaking havoc throught the raid.
