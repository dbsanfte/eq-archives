I do wonder about those reps, though... I have a wood elf druid, I 
actually find it the single hardest character for me to play.  Different 
strokes and all, I guess.  My Barbie warrior, now, she's fun. :) I can 
definitely see the questionable rep, though.  I know I'm prone to my 
sudden blonde moments when playing her... Of course we can take 7 mobs!  
Ngyaah!

I don't really see gnome wizard as being in any way easy... or wizard of 
any kind, really.  If they have a bad rep, I'd think it'd mostly be that 
they're grumpy a lot.  But the same could be said of a fair number of 
dwarves, but there it's in character somehow.

}They aren't all bad. They probably aren't even mostly bad. But when
}you run into a twit, its more likely to be one of those four than
}anything else. In my experience, at least.

I dunno, the numbers are kinda screwy and it's hard to do a really 
controlled study.  After all, someone -did- do some sort of reasonably 
controlled study of the distribution of players among the various races 
and classes (I'm sorry I don't have the link, but it's been posted here at 
least twice in my recollection) and Druis were far and away the 
most-played class, Wood elves won on race, with halflings a close second.  
So, given that alone, it's not suprising that the greatest number of twits 
you meet are some combination of those races/class, since the greatest 
number of -people- you meet are.  When I think of twits I've met in game, 
three spring instantly to mind:  One, the wood elf druid who KSed the 
ancient croc from me (and subsequently admitted to the GM that he had done 
so, and who strangely hasn't shown up on /who in forever, and nobody in 
his former guild seems to remember him...) Two, a particular Gnomish Necro 
who definitely seemed to enjoy grief play, and three, a gnomish mage on 
the test server, who was intent on showing me exactly why all servers 
should be PvP and the rules shouldn't apply to -him-.  There have been 
some others that stick less in my mind...  Quite a few Vah Shir, recently.
A fair number of Iksar Monks.  It's amazing how many Erudites... 
especially males I think, seem really depressed and sometimes whiny a lot 
of the time.  It's not enough to call them twits, but it certainly doesn't 
add to the joy of being with them.

}Alternatively, there's some combos that seem to lead to nice people
}more often than others. Troll warriors, shorty clerics, most dwarves
}of any class, hybrids, enchanters before they become embittered over
}non-assisters, non pure caster gnomes to name a few.

The enchanter bit... yes, we can be un-fun when we're just first becoming 
embittered by the non-assisters, but we seem to level back out when we 
come to terms with the fact that our resulting death is really not that 
big a deal.  Usualy about when we start regularly having a 49+ cleric in 
the group. :)  Gotta love those non-caster gnomes, though, definitely.  
That takes guts. :)

Paladins.  It's really amazing, for a class that's supposed to be all 
holy, exactly how many of them are so thoroughly -not-.  And there's a 
fair whack of nimrod-enabled bards out there, too.

Of course, for every single class/race I've ragged on here, I can think of 
at least one shining counterexample. :)
