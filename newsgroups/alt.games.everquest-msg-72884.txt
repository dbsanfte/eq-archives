I asked this NG, a day or so ago, about changing textures/models, having
upgraded my system since SoL came out. Tonight I went into the game to see
what the new changes had wrought. I checked first on Darklet, druid of 17
seasons, since she is my primary character. She was seated by the tollgate
guards in WCommons, when I entered the game. I immediately hit F9 so that I
could see what changes had been wrought.

Although the halflings look -great- now, I was disappointed. I'm not even
sure -why- I was disappointed -- I simply was. Yes, the new textures had
taken effect. I ran around aimlessly for a few moments to be sure what,
exactly, it was that I needed to watch for...

Standing still, so far as I've noted, reaps the most benefit, in eye candy.
It reminds me of the skellies which are truly animated now, unless you start
beating on them, in which case they simply stand there and 'appear' to sway,
despite the bashing they are actually giving you (ok, TRYing to give you)
(no, can't die to them lately, unless VI has -really- upped the ante).

I didn't play. I left. Mostly, I wanted to see what it was that I had paid
for with the SoL expansion (oh, and I -really- don't like the BLord class,
so, unfortunately, it was something of a waste for me, as far as that was
concerned... also, as far as the new textures were concerned, as well, it
seems... )

Ok... I sit here thinking about why I was disappointed, and I think that I
might actually know, more-or-less, what that disappoinment might consist of.
It's like the skellies... eye candy and not much else. I used to really
enjoy watching Darklet bashing away (no matter how slowly) at some mob. I
suppose, from what I saw tonight, that I will no longer have even that
pleasure.

If I'm wrong, or if there is something that might be done to fix it, please
let me know! Actually, I never went out to kill something, so I am only
guessing at what might happen, in combat.
