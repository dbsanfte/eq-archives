I'm not sure you should get away with dismissing this paragraph entirely -
by sweeping it away with "babble," it appears to me you don't understand the
point I'm making; I can't think of a much clearer way to point out that
despite a declaration of "freedom" and "rights," there is always going to be
limitations placed on these rights.  I repeat, the more rights one has - and
the more freedom people have - then the more limitations have to be imposed
on those rights in order to prevent one persons right infringing on another
persons right.  NB I didn't bring this up neccessarily as an argument, just
as something interesting to consider - how far can we actually take the
concepts of individual liberty?  How do we weigh the needs and rights of the
individual against those of the community?

Yes we are a parliamentary democracy.

I deny that it is the fault of the United States.  I state that the United
States is nationalist and individualist, and I state the Australia is
becoming less egalitarian and developing along similar path.  The
responsibility (or "fault?") for this is entirely Australia's.

I concede that it is impossible assume responsibility for someones actions.
There are plenty of organisations that nonetheless enshrine certain
responsibilities in a constitution.  Why?

I would suggest that refugees do have rights - for a start, a) because they
are human, and b) in international convention (www.unhcr.ch).  I stand by
the difference in feeling of the two statements.
