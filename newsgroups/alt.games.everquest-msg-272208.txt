Yup. Read the skill descriptions for what they do. There are only sets
of 3 for each combine type that can be used, too. The first tier
skills raise progress slightly at the cost of either power, success
chance, or durability (the latter two costs are very slight and not
worth worrying about.). The second tier skills raise durability at the
cost of either power, success chance, or progress (again, the costs
are slight compared to the benefits). As an added bonus, the skills
from this tier also raise your crafting skills through use rather than
only being able to raise them from successful end products.
