My little Ratonga soon-to-be-Illusionist (one named kill left for the F->Q
betrayal) has a two Adept 1 spells, about 4 Apprentice III, and the rest App2.

It definitely seems that some Adept 1 are common, and most are rare.  The ones
I find tend to sell pretty cheaply, and the ones I want are darned expensive
or simply never for sale.  

I have two main questions:

1) has anyone started doing actual parses and comparisons of the effects of
different spell levels?  I keep forgetting to do it, and I usually level a few
times between tests, making the comparison impossible.  My gut feel is that
it's a large upgrade from app1 to app2, a small upgrade (if any) from app2 to
app3, and then a medium upgrade to adept 1.   

2) is anyone finding spells better than adept 1?  I have yet to ever see
(dropped or for sale) any adept 2+, or any master spells.  Are they only
available to very high level characters? 


On a related note, Sony's clever plan of only allowing player trades when
someone is online and in their room may actually anger me enough to quit
eventually, but for now it mostly means I have to sell books I find pretty
cheaply so they go quick (they also seem to always be fairly common), and the
selection when I want to buy is very poor.

I understand that this is their intent, but it's a very bad one, and it REALLY
irks me that the only people who can sell things effectively are those who
don't mind dedicating their computer to EQ2 forever.  It bugged me in EQ1 too,
but it was such an improvement when they added it that it seemed less dumb.
Really, it's a horrible design choice.

The major benefit will go to ebay platinum sellers, once things get rolling.
They'll be able to put in the time to work the market, and reap the benefits.
