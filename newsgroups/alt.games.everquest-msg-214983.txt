The only way to get over the hump in relation to being in a group is to join
one - l used to hate it at the start, feel like l wasn't contributing much
but l stuck with it and have learnt heaps from it.  It did show me the other
side of a lot of players, whilst some were cool headed and planned melee
well, there were the idoits who would "accidently" pick up mobs - but once
you have them pegged it's up to you whether or not you stay.

I have also met some of my best EQ friends from this, and as such we now
have our own guild (although it's small) where we can group or chat any
time, all levels, all classes.   I love it!
