Nope.  Stats have no effect on success rate, only on skill gain.

The only thing that affects success is your skill, and the trivial level of
the item you're attempting to make.

Nope.  Verant has confirmed that DEX plays a role in tailoring and fletching
skill gain.  It has no effect on pottery or jewelry.

But don't take my word for it. From

As of May 13, 2001, the following information was confirmed directly to
Niami, by Yakatizma (tradeskills developer at Verant) with regards to stats
and tradeskills. This is the MOST recent information we have available,
despite at least a dozen different message board threads from folks trying
to pull information from old threads, other sites, etc. When we/I know more,
it will be posted here, but please, in the meantime, accept that this is as
recent/accurate as it gets. Debate it all you want, as Verant has been known
to be wrong before, but please, folks, don't expect me to re-re-re-restate
this information in every new message board thread that you feel like
starting. ;)

INT & WIS: whichever of the two is higher will affect SKILL INCREASES when
practicing ALL tradeskills. The higher either your INT or WIS is, the
greater the chance you have for a skill gain while tradeskilling.

STR: higher strength will give you an added bonus to your chance at gaining
SKILL INCREASES while smithing. 

DEX: higher dexterity will give you an added bonus to your chance at gaining
SKILL INCREASES while fletching or tailoring.

CHA: higher charisma, along with faction, will affect your buying and
selling prices with merchants.

Stats have NO IMPACT on your chance of success or failure when practicing
tradeskills. (Only your current skill is supposed to impact your chances of
success or failure when creating an item.)

Yes, this is subject to change/debate, but until otherwise corrected by
Verant itself, this is the last official word we have on the subject.
