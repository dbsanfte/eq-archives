That might be your situation now, later in the game your monetary
situationwill be such that you will have no quarms offering up 50pp for a
port to where you want to go.
How would it be less of a pain in the butt if every wizard spire just had to
be clicked on to port you to any location you liked?
Not much I hear you say.

But as the system is in place where wizards and druids benefit greatly from
being able to use this skill, to do something like you propose would wreck
the game system.

In a game such as ultima online, their system is much different ( better in
my opinion). You can bind a rune to any location and then teleport by
casting a spell on that rune to return to that location. Almost a make your
own teleport spot kind of thing.
A much better system indeed but it would probably not suit the EQ
environment and would piss off every wizard out there cos we know theyre
only good for one thing :P
