I know that but I don't think you see what I was saying, inner fire is
a cheap heal when you recast it. If someone casts courage or skin like
wood over your inner fire its not a very nice surprise when you cast
inner fire to heal and instead of being healed you get the "will not
take effect message." I know I can click it off at that point and do
it again, if I'm alive.
