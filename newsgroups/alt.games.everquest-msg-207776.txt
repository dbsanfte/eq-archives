I know that EQ would be more comfortable with 1GB of RAM than with the 
amount I have, but my mobo only has two memory slots, and I'm not 
comfortable with buying a not inexpensive 512MB DDR stick if I'm not 
guaranteed results. I'm pretty sure my performance problems aren't down 
to page swapping, at any rate.

Thanks for the suggestions, though.
