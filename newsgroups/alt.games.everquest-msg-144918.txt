I never heard of it, but then when I actually cared (previous
character who was a smith using it for dye) it wasn't
a rare drop in the Hole, it was fairly common... and of course
useless other than as a vanity.

If its a well known ground spawn, and yet selling for
500pp plus, I assume its evercamped on most servers.  If
its "spawns randomly in the zone on rare occaisions..." well
that amounts to less of a plan than hunting in the Hole in
the first place!
