    The OOR problem happens a lot in PoP. Rooms are huge, so clerics
misjudge how far they are from people, and with all the swarm pets pushing
mobs there can be a lot of camp movement. When we were doing Agnarr, the MA
on Agnarr kept sliding out of heal range. I sent him a quick tell - "Pin
Agnarr or go OOR and die." You've never seen a troll warrior circle-strafe
as fast as ours did to pin Agnarr to the wall. ;-)
