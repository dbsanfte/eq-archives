Nope.   The other 4 slots are filled from the 20 or so melee characters
waiting at the zone for a group with a cleric and enchanter.   Some of the
easier camps can be done without one or the other... but usually not having
means that you end up doing nothing.

While this poster is clearly a moron... Sorry Ryouseika, you just don't
understand what you're talking about at the moment.   The fact is the high
level game is pretty broken for experience gaining.   There are only three
places in the end game where all 50+ players end up going to get groups.
Karnor's Castle, Sebilis, and lately Velks Labyrinth has become crowded, since
the experinece gain there was increased.

Any zone other than this is bring your own group.

Yes, it is wildly overcrowded with so many people at these levels for so long
(each one is a hell all it's own) and only three good places to accomidate
them all.  But there just isn't anywhere else to go.

If you leave Karnor's for being overcrowded... well, the other two are usually
worse.

Checking the next zone in this case means getting a port to either Great
Divide or Dreadlands, and then finding out that the other two dungeons are
just as crowded.

At levels like you're at now, there are several zones you can go to, and each
one is less crowded.    In Seb or KC or others, groups generally don't move
away from the zone line without 6 people in them already (Since you can't
exactly jaunt back to get another person usually, unless you have a 55 mage
with you.)    Shouting that you are LFG doesn't have much effect when there
are 10 other people sitting next to you shouting the same thing.

Any openings are filled immediately, out of those 10 people who are waiting.

And before you ask, no those 10 people usually cannot just form a group and
head in on thier own.   You can get away with sub optimal class balances in
the lower level places, but in seb a group of 3 warriors, 1 shadowknight, 1
druid and a wizard wouldn't be able to do much other than trying to single
pull the entrance mobs to keep busy.

Not at this level.

Most of these locations are an outright joke.    VP, Sleepers tomb, Temple of
Veeshan are raid level locations for uberguilds only.  Western Wastes is a
dragon infested death trap.   Dragon Necropolis requres a super high level
group of perfect class balance.  Skyshrine and Kael Drakkel are mostly multi
group hunting situations.    I've heard of single groups attempting Kael
Arena, but they generally dont' go too well.  BYOG.


Cobalt Scar, City of Mist and Iceclad Ocean.   Really green zones with a few
blue mobs, (in Iceclad's case only 1 that I can think of).  Should not be on
the list.

Wakening Land and Great Divide.  Only the elites in GD and sentient armors in
WL will be blue to you.   Very poor experience gain.   Some small pickup
action, but not much.  Definitely not enough to be worth hanging around for.
Or traveling there to get to.

Skyfire and Burning Woods.   Soloing zones really.   The last ones.   Awful
experience, and enough to drive you nuts.    BYOG if you intend to do anything
other than kite.  Zero loot.

Icewell Keep, Chardok and Sirens Grotto.  Nice zones, but a great deal of
effort to get far.   BYOG, and a strong one.  Mobs have lots of hit points,
and hit like a ton of bricks.

Howling Stones, great zone from what I've heard.   BYOG, well balanced, of
course, and each group member must first complete the key quest.  (Requires
camping Xalgoz, the boss of Kaesora.)

Leaving Sebilis, Karnor's Castle and Velks Lab.    (and really, except for the
basement, Karnors seems to be getting green here and there.)


I'm not advocating stealing camps or petitioning to try and squeeze in with
the "play nice policy"  Both are pretty stupid moves.   Good luck even getting
a big enough group of idiots who will try it...   and be the right classes to
survive.  Or doing anything afterwards, since nobody on the server would give
you the time of day, other than the few idiots you gather.

Why did I post this?  I don't know.  Late at night and I felt like bitching.
Just killed my 10,000'th frog and Sebilis is getting on my nerves. ; )
Tired, and your tone sounded pretty offensive to those of us who would really
like to go different places, but find themselves unable to.   (Or at least
this person who would.)
