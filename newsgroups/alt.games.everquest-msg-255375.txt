Some are.  *I* am saying that if there is a single *uber* item my ranger could
solo and get in 500 hours I haven't figured out what it is yet.  Of course, I
could just farm spider silks at 58 and buy some pretty uber stuff in the bazaar
if I don't like that option.

I don't suffer from envy.  I wasn't raised that way.  I'm used to hard work. 
Period the end.  (If I just wanted to be *better* than everyone else I'd just
ebay uber stuff: )))).
So you are saying *most* people  have a personal quest to be better than
everyone else?   That has *never* been one of my goals.  I just want to be able
to keep up with my friends and not be a burden to my groups.
And are you also saying that to be better than everyone else you have to play
in areas that have the *worst content in the entire game*?  That's just scary. 
To pay to play in areas that you think suck so that you can be the most uber?
I hope SOE is listening to this.
