Technically it would work. Duel to create a 0xp loss short rez timer 
corpse. Cast 0%Rez, make train, accept rez (tp back to corpse and clear 
aggro).

I've used this a few times on particularly difficult CRs or to travel 
through nasty areas (not to train) in small groups that didn't have the 
normal utility (e.g. no fd class, no inviser, etc)... one class runs in 
pulling a train, the rest follow in the empty path to a safe point, 
dragging the corpse, once at the safe point, cast 0% rez, puller accepts 
and we're all at the safe camp with no aggro.
