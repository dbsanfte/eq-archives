This is good advice... the "Classic Everquest" comes in a tiny box now and I
bought it for 9.99 and it came with a free month, almost like getting the
software for free.

This would probably be a good idea to see if you like it, heck, you could
even buy 4 of these and install them and see if everyone likes it.. then if
they do, you will be shelling out alot of money to get EVERYONE setup and
running with all expansions... not to mention you'll be paying 9.89 a month
for each account, nearly $40 a month to have all 4 playing at once.
