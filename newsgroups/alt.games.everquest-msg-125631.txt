Yes, you can do that by putting the forage ability into a hot button, then assigning
one or two of the movement keys (I use left and right arrows) to activate "User-defined <hot_key_number>"
For example, I have mine set to put forage in hot key 10.  To assign the left and right
movement buttons to hot key 10, I go to options, then keyboard, then scroll down
to "User-defined 10".  Left click in the first box, and hit left-arrow, then RIGHT-click
in the second box and hit right-arrow.

From then on, any time you hit the left or the right arrow, in addition to moving, it'll
press hot key 10.

Good luck
