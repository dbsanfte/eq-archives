Hello Gang,

I have a question regarding an item that I cannot find information on...

My Ranger is working on her foraging skills (preparing to forage for the
hardened mixture for the Epic Quest don'tcha know...hehe) and anyway, she
has foraged quite a few Sop Bark pieces...  These are found in Warslik's
Woods.  Unlike the Oak Bark that I sold for 10 pp a piece, the Sop Bark is
non stackable.  Now, the Oak Bark is used in the making of Wood Elf Cultural
Tailored Armor apparently.  Anyone have any ideas what Sop Bark is for?

Thanks in advance!
