As it turns out, I was cleaning out my desk during my brief hiatus from
the game, and found my spiral notebook which I used for recording tons
of information during the early levels of my first few characters. The
silk info is in there. This weekend (no promises) I'll attempt to type
it up, or at least the sum totals and summary, of that information. I
know we tested Large and Giant spiders in the commons, Dune tarantualas,
Wisp Island spiders, UGuk Heart Spiders, and EK craigs. Possibly some
others.
