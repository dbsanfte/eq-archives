Ok I've been growing as a Cleric. But my ability to fight has transversely
been growing lesser to my healing ability.Just because I've been meding
while the rest of the group is fighting.So my question is "Is this a bad
thing?" ...or  "Is this something a cleric should let go ?"Do I worry about
my weapon or my ability to save my group members?
What do you think?
