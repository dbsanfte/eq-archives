There are still people using Win95 and that came out over 6 years ago.  I
really wouldn't worry about it.  I seriously doubt if any program written in
the next year will force you to upgrade...even software from Microsoft.
More than likely you can use Win98SE for a few more years at a minimum
without much trouble.  I doubt if you'll WANT to by then, but....
