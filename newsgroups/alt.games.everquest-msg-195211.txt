No logic particularly needed, observation works fine.  The simplest
automobiles tend to be the most reliable, complex designs, most
especially new models, tend to be very flawed.  Likewise, the more
complex and newer traffic signal control systems are the ones I
see "flashing red" most often.

You don't want to pay for "life critical" reliability standards for
EQ.  You don't even want to think about paying that much.

Simple is easier, "been around for a while" is easier, complex is
harder, newer (i.e. less tested in actual use) is more failure prone,
"life critical" is very difficult and expensive (at least it is in
a society like 21st century America where the standard is very high
and the shysters are drooling in anticipation of any event that can
be construed as "malpractice").


I'm trying, without much success, to fathom just what the point of

your reply to Rumbledor was supposed to be.  The only services you
suggested for comparison involved "life critical" systems that are
totally non-applicable. The products you mention are more aptly
compared to the platform on which the EQ client runs than to EQ
itself, and with the exception of a subset of the most modern
automobiles (the newest and most complex, and thus most failure
prone mind you) are not even vaguely comparable to EQ in terms of
complexity and novelty.  Perhaps you could make try to make your
point more directly?
