Killing Guardians, Sentrys, Fe'Dhars (if you ever see one you'll know what I
mean), the named drakes and just about everything else in the zone gives CoV
minus, Kromrif/Kromzek plus (maybe Tormax, don't think so though)

Killing the spiders (who are indiff by default) gives no hits

Killing the head honcho, Lord Yelinak, gives Yelinak minus, and Tormax plus.
(and maybe CoV minus, not sure though)
