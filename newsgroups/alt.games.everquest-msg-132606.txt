I did....I tried it with several weapons and other equipment.  I wanted to
*make sure* before I posted here.  Not only is it adding a  phenominal
amount, but it's such an odd number ass well (269).  My attack sucks and I
almost strictly use instruments.  I figured that's the only way I would
pretty much be fighting, but kept an eye out for at least one decent weapon
for a decent price anyhow.  So when I saw a JBoM being /auctioned for 750pp
I snapped it up.
I guess this is either a bug or a mystery!
