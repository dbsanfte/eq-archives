I find it unreliable...but, YMMV.

At what level do critical nukes become available?

I'm only level 30.

What luck.  :)

Just curious: In what way?

Ah...  :(

I don't think I have the patience to play my wizard to the high
50s and 60.  Unfortunately, I just don't enjoy the class that
much.

: Low levels solo you're probably right. Get some more levels and an

Yeah, that does sound like fun.

Unfortunately, I like to solo as well as group.  I think I'm
personally better off choosing a class with a bit more utility.
