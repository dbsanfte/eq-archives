Thanks to everyone that posted. You've been a great help!
I did start my GB quest last nite as a result.

As to the L1 and L2 pally's with Soulfire. That's just wrong. Whatever
happened to satisfaction of a job well done? Oh well, I guess bottom line,
it doesn't affect how I play or how EQ plays for me if some twink has the
Soulfire at an obscenely low level. But I guess it does cheapen the SF
somewhat in other people's eyes. Ah well. C'est la vie.
