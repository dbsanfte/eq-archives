Yes, but, you wouldn't know that you need to look for a missed patch
message.  All you know is that you downloaded a patch, and saw a patch
message, it does not inform you that it is actually the last 2 or more
patches.  As a regular reader here however, that excuse doesn't really work,
particularly given that the patch messages are always posted here at least
once.
