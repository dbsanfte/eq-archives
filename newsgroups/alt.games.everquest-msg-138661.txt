That very much suggests to me that you didn't even read my reply.  MY 
concern IS equality, the general principle.  If you can deliver 'more' 
equality than just addressing the one or two issues, I will be glad to 
sign on.

A bit of experience in politics has taught me that you have to be ready to 
compromise, however.  I very much doubt that going after total equality 
will get me very far in most situations.  I have to be willing to back 
down to just getting the most grievous inequalities addressed, or I will 
have accomplished nothing.  There are exceptions, but not very often.

Example of an exception:  A couple years ago, I was writing the bylaws 
for a newly-formed linux user's group (LUGOD).  Most of the peoplein the 
group were computer geeks and not policy geeks, and could really care less 
what was in the bylaws... All they cared about was that I told them we 
needed them to become a non-profit organization, so could I please write 
something up.  Given a free hand like that, it would be reasonable to 
expect that the bylaws I generate would be a good reflection of my 
actual views.  (Except for the parts that they have since amended... 
Grr... Article II  Section 4 is just -bad-.) From these bylaws, the only 
non-discrimination statement I found it necessary to put in is the 
following:

--- Lugod Bylaws, Article VI
Members attending the event are requested to remember that they are 
representing LUGOD, and not behave in a manner that may tarnish the club's 
image.  People encountered in the course of the event with differing views 
and differing OSes should be treated with dignity and respect despite 
their somewhat questionable tastes.
--- http://www.lugod.org/objectives/bylaws.html

You will note that no part of that lists a 'laundry list' of groups not to 
discriminate against.  That would be my favored way of dealing with 
equality.  It only singles out one particular type of discrimination, 
beacuse that type (discrimination on the base of OS preference) is tied 
part and parcel to the nature of the organization.  It is, however, very 
careful to note that that is not the only difference to be 'treated with 
dignity and respect', and that ALL differing views should be so treated.

In contrast, that same year I was the UCDavis representatve to the 
National Association of Graduate and Professional Students (NAGPS), a 
lobbying organization.  During the course of the annual meeting, Article 
XIII of their bylaws came up for review.  I proposed the same sort of 
universal blanket statement, and another group proposed the 'laundry-list'
style statement.  We argued back and forth about it for the better part of 
the day, and well past when everyone just wanted to head off to the 
parties, but when it finally came down to a vote, it was laundry-list 
about 65%, my much more equal idea about 20%, and quite a number of 
abstentions.  Hmm, page seems to not be loading right now... but their 
bylaws are at http://www.nagps.org/bylaws.html .

This leads to me thinking that these lovey universal equality ideas you 
have, like an all-inclusive definition of marriage or one extra benefit 
per employee, married or not, may encounter a certain amount of trouble 
getting adopted.  This does not change the fact, however, that I would 
support them wholeheartedly, and in fact prefer them to just getting 
benefits or rights for one or two particular groups.  

Now, if after that, you still believe I'm only worried about MY concern, 
I'm afraid you're just too dense to have a reasonable discussion with.  So 
suprise me, please.
