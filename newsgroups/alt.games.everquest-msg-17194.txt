Errr so what if I changed my mind?  it *is* my game, I did pay for it, I
should be able to use it as and when, if the system is flawed in such a way
as to prevent that then I have every right to be pissed off.  Of course I am
going to blame them when I try to use something I bought only to find I
gotta remember stuff from 2 years ago.  Bear In mind that I am not trying to
access the old account (pretty sure I cancelled it anyway), I couldnt care
less about the old account, but I am unable to even create a new one, just
seems stupid to me.  What do you care anyway?  you work for them or
something?  You must realise that by posting nothing but insults and sarcasm
with no hint of anything even vaguely usefull, your just as guilty of acting
childishly.  Try mixing your sarcasm with some usefull info and I might
credit you with a bit more intelligence,

Paul.
