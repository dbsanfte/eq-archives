Sounds more like a problem with your provider or a fault on the modem
(perhaps heating up). Some ISP's disconnect you from their service if they
detect inactivity for 2 mins or so to prevent congestion. Maybe you can run
a IRC client in the background with an open channel of chat to keep internet
traffic moving between your machine and your ISP. The server side
filtering/chat filters are more tuned to preventing lag for dialup users and
mipmap,sky etc is for keeping lag down on lower spec end machines that dont
have the grpahics power to keep up
