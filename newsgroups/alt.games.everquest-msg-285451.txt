So their little gnomes who sells the stones for corpse summons would
stay in business.

It's also to keep us on our toes.  Ooh, look a dark blue named mob
floating around in Arcstone.  Aggro it, and go whap-slap-splat.  Look
up the mob on Allakhazam and find out it's almost a raid level mob
after all.  That has happened to me a few times, usually in newer
expansions when they are just released.
