I don't see how that really improves things. Instead of 2+ groups 
camping the named spawn, 2+ groups are hailing the npc, running the 
quest or whatever, and then rushing over to where he's supposed to pop.

And perhaps still finding the area camped, by a group that thinks its 
just good xp in the throne room. (And if someone elses triggered King 
pops, well, they can kill that too.)

Or perhaps the king will pop wherever that group happens to go. So 
instead of cutting a swathe to the thickly populated throne room and 
taking the king in his place of power amongst all his generals and 
advisors they can wait for him the nice large open kiter friendly 
courtyard...

I dunno... it might work. I like the micro-zone instance tucked deep in 
the heart of the dungeon better.
