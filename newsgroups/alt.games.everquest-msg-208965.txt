I group with a lvl 65, 200 AA necro on a pretty regular basis and
they're still incredible soloers and groupers. By far the most
efficient soloers at 65 (with the possible exception of quad and charm
kiters) if they stick to non-summoning mobs and they have the ability
to put out obscene DPS in a group (stack a couple of dots then spend
the rest of the fight feigned to duck agro) while adding nice mana
(KEI level) and hitpoint regen. Not to mention necro rez, which at
300p is quite viable for trips where you don't expect people to die
often.
