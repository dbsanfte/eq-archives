Well, I crashed again last night.  This time I was doing nothing but
standing in POK.  I have moved my Sound Card to a different slot, cleared
out the CMOS settings in the BIOS and reinstalled Windows XP Pro with SP1.
Everything not related to running EQ is disabled(like my USB controllers,
Parallel ports, gaming ports, ect).  I think I have the very minimum enabled
to run the game.

I found a set of beta drivers for the Sound Blaster Audigy at Toms hardware.
Creative says that these have been tested and they will officially be
released in August.  They claim that these have been optimized for Gamers
and infact warn that these may keep some of the Sound Blaster utilities from
working properly.  I say, "Big deal, This is my gaming box.  I am not going
to do any sound editing with it".  I am going to stick with the NVIDIA
drivers that Mircosoft included with SP1 and I am not going to patch
anything in Windows.  Again, this is my gaming box and I do  not care too
much about security.  I have loaded EQ and  I am also not going to use any
customized UI files.  Hopefully I will find that the system will run EQ more
reliably and I can get back to leveling.

I will post again if this is successful.

Frankly if this fails I may just give up EQ.
