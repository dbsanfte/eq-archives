Your answer is indeed funny as the only ONE person i've read about in a DAoC
board that said he wanted to quit was a level 30+. Lots of "EQ DrOOd" type
people seem disapointed as they powerleveled as fast as they could. And now
find themselves having been flying over 30 plus levels without apreciating
the quests / stories they could have (My wife and i after 4 weeks are having
a blast in game .. and we play 3 hours a day in week and about 12 hours per
week end). Those people just wanted .. well ... to be super powered i guess.
But they didnt know perhaps that DAoC being a new game, the lvl 35+ PVe had
little chances of being itemized/having lots of dungeons. As in : what are
the chances "everyday" people (i consider my wife and i play more thant
average) would get to lvl30+ in less than 3 weeks ? None is the answer. It's
not a rant vs people that have a lot of time... I am just astonished to see
dozens of people ranting becasue they dont have the lvl 30+ content they
expect, and the RvR lacks large forces to be interesting. Comme on... the
game is one month old. The game is maturing nicely, getting more and more
intesresting. I just guess that for once, the power gamers werent rewarded.
Is that a bad thing ? you tell me...
