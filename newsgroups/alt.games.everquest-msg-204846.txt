Oh boy, you are still on the 'easy' stuff, you have Wu's to plough
through yet, before you can even look sideways at acrylia studded.

Wu's is easy enough if you throw money at it, but if like me you make
all the bits yourself its a heck of a lot of work per piece....take up
fletching instead, theres a steady demand for arrows and you can GM on
it straight out of a store.


Mrowh 55/54 Beastlord on Karana.

Frostfist (41) Beastlord on Stromm.

Otserp (32) Mage on Venril Sathir.

Wikkan (42) Druid on Karana, Nekk (32) Necromancer, Moorbane (26) Warrior, Zinga (32) Bard, etc....
