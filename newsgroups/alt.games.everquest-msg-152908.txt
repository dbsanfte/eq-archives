Yes, you're right.  The bazaar leads in that direction.  But, as with
so many things in life, it gives benefits back that are sufficient to
warrant its inclusion in the game.  The consignment shop would, IMO,
tremendously aggravate the "bad" effects of the bazaar with very little
payback.  The folks who do not have 24x7 access are not as hindered as
you are making out.  I have a Druid on FV server, who is played only
rarely on a server that has a very weak bazaar compared to the "blue"
servers (many fewer mules because of one char per account limit), who
has received substantial benefit from the bazaar as it is.  And he
would probably be <hurt> by a consignment shop, it would probably make
it impossible for him to make any useful amount of pp on those rare
occasions that I set him up to sell foraged stuff and tradeskill
ingredients for a few hours.  So, here is a character of mine who is
essentially in a worse position than your "don't have 24x7 access"
players who would receive less benefit than he does in the current
system where he has at least some hope of finding gear he wants
actually available at an affordable price, plus he can try to sell
some stuff once in a while.  A "consignment shop" would likely
take much of the affordable gear off the market (prices would be
driven so lo that people would just dump most stuff on vendors)
and deny him the chance to make a little pp on the side every once
in a while.

No, it would change things a lot more than you are expecting,
and IMO the change(s) would be overwhelming for the worse.
