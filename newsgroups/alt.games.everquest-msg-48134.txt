There should be some system in place to help prevent this. I'm on
Rallos, but I know other servers have public boards to check for
reservations. Usually we'll just check other raid group boards for
conflicting events. If we don't find anything, then we make sure
to get there early. Usually if it's Fear/Hate/PoG, we try to get
started as early as 6am PST so we make sure we get it, and often
stay for the entire day.
