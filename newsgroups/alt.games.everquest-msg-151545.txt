It will load the game on old world and Kunark. Velious will run but barely
and Luclin will not run.

My 16mb TNT2 PCi runs Luclin with everything switched off but I can't play
the game in most zones on Luclin as it is too laggy.

Cards based on the gforce 2 chipset are so cheap these days it would be
pointless to struggle with the card.
