>Sony pretty much says all these video cards have no known issues... and
>what's this an issue??

Properly configured most (not all) cards run EQ just fine.

Sony is not responsible for poorly configured systems, or users that
are not compentent at troubleshooting and resolving driver problems.

I have been able to successfully run SoL on the following cards in 3
differernt systems (2 AMD Athlon 900s, and 1 Intell P3-733)

Voodoo5
GeForce 256
Radeon LE 32DDR
Radeon 8500 OEM

You are beginning to sound like a broken record. EQ:SoL is the "ONLY"
DX8.1 required game. Saying "all my other games run fine" is futile.
It is comparing apples to oranges. 

Buy a better card (the Rage Fury was "NEVER" a main stream 3D gaming
card like the Voodoo, and TNT/GeForce series), quit, or fly to Canada
and make ATI write new Rage Fury drivers at gun point.
