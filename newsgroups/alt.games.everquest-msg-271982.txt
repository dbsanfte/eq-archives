Yes, why not simplify it even further. If you target a green mob, it
ides and you lose 5% health and power; a blue mob, 10%; a white mob,
50%, a yellow mob, 75% and an organge mob, 90%. No need to waste time
'fighting', the mob just dies and you take a set amount of damage.

Someone will STILL probably whine the game is too complicated. ("All
those colors! Why not just have 'you will win' and 'you will lose'
monsters?")

In my dream MMORPG, 'con' is a skill you have to learn, and it's
learned by monster type. Someone who has killed millions of orcs can
effectively judge an orc's level. ("See those bones on the necklace?
That's the sign of an Elder Shaman.") Someone who has never seen an
undead won't be able to tell a 1st level skeleton from a 20th level
lich-lord, and will drastically over- or under- con it.
