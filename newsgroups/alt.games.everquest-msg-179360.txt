Hi All,

Well, I just cancelled my pre-ordered LoY tonight. I grew to feel that
this was not an expansion at all, at least not my definition of an
expansion. It feels more like a simple change in content of already
existing product. I hope it doesn't actually turn out this way, but will
now wait to see.

Also, there was talk tonight about another price increase. Is this true?
Didn't the last increase boost SOE's profit per month quite a bit?
Hmmmmm.

No you cannot CIHYS, because I'm not quitting, I just climbed back up on
the fence so to speak.
