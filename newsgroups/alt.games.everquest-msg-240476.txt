2.5 mil sold... 420k subscrivers... ~16.8% active... not bad. However
they claim 250,000 new subscribers per year... which is 10% of
2.5mil... which means they've only retained 6.8% from previous years
(assuming everyone who just signed up last year is still on... which
of course isn't going to be true but I'd guess that most people give
it a couple months at least...  but even so ....

I'd be VERY curious to know what the rentention percentage is for each
year. Ie what percent of people in 99 still playing... for each year
until today...

But would not get you even half way from Chicgago to New York, which
is a distance far far far more people have a clue about. ;)

Hmmm that's the same number as last year give or take... implying
250,000 people left eq...

Where did they get this?

Only? That's nearly triple what it would be if it were an even
distribution. 1/15th is around 6.7%

I wonder if 3/4s of Atlanta is not in Atlanta at any given time
though.

Whoops... forgot to add 3000 named mobs to spawn tables ;)
