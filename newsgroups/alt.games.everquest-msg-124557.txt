I wasn't dumping on VIA. All three of my PCs at home use VIA chips,
and overall I am very happy with them.

Still, there have been a LOT more issues with VIA chipsets and SBLive!
cards than all othes combined, and I am not talking EQ only.

Since EQ is the only game with the problem, it is surely something
with Verants implementation of DirectSound or EAX.
