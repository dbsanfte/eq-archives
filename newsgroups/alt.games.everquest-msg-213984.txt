I have ack'd snare overwrites movement at least twice. I am well aware of it
as any person that has run a ranger or a druid and confused the snare icon
with the SoW icon..

I have mentioned the DOT component ad nauseum. I grow tired of mentioning
it. If you don't think a couple of hundred points of damage along with a
snare is a neat thing, if you think a 2 for one spell isn't a nice feature,
well then you have an honest difference of opinion.

But don't say I haven't mentioned the DOT component in the comparison and
I'm not addressing the difference. It is obvious you are not fully reading
my post before you respond because not even having to go to another thread,
just below in this post. I have been saying this from the very begining.

If you read my other posts you will see I believe the whole 'DOT will break
mezz' is a strawman. So no, this is not a strawman argument as I understand
the term so much as a response to dispell one. That is, not breaking mez and
longer durations were given as the reasons for 'snare is better.'

Any character that breaks mez gets told to stop or be kicked from a group.
Any group of newbies<remember that is the topic> that needs a 14 minute
snare to take down a level appropriate monster is in trouble.

I'm responding to you, but this isn't directed so much at you as everyone
that immediately drifts a newbie thread to advanced tactics of plane raids.
Read this part before you respond.

Caps for emphasis
Frigging ensnare is a LEVEL 29 DRUID SPELL!
Clinging darkness is a LEVEL 4 NECRO SPELL!
The title of the thread "Total Newbie to EQ"

Think about it. Are you really serving the interests of the poster by
comparing a level 29 spell to a spell line that starts at level 4? If you
want to be intellectually honest you would be comparing the a druids at
level 4 snare, ~24 seconds, to a necros darkness.

This fast drifting of newbie advice threads so people can get in an advanced
tactics/character pissing contest does not sit well with me. If the original
poster wants to know what to do when he hits level 29 I am sure he will come
back and ask. I refuse to participate in it any longer unless you change the
title of the thread.
