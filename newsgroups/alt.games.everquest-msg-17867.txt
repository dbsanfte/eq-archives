LOL Yeah just because OE reads USENET posts, doesn't make it a proper USENET
reader.

You should also switch to PINE for all your e-mail needs, because well it is
a REAL applcaition.

While youre at it, ditch that stupid GUI First Person MMORPG for something
more REAL like Zork. Cause command line based games are so much more fun.
