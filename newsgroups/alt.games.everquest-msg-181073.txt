I do not miss EC one bit, I loathed having to run through it.  I loathed
trying to seel my crap there.  I love the Bazaar, I plop my bazaar mule down
with all my crap, and it sells overnight while I am sleeping.  I can find
the things I need in the Bazaar, generally at reasonable prices.  No need to
haggle, just buy it and get back to playing.
