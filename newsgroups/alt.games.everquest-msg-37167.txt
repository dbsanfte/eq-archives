Okay.  I'll rephase it.
I, personally, have never know VI to do an emergency patch  for
anything that didn't adversly affect gameplay.  In other words, somethng
despratly needs to be fixed and it can't wait to the next schedualed patch.
For example, spells stop working, dup exploit, etc.  I've never seen them
run an unschedualed "emergancy" patch to just add content.

Didn't mean to give the impression that I was basing my statement on
the sole event of adding new zones.  Perhaps I should have been more
clear for the literal minded. =)

To summerize:
In my limited time (year and a hlaf, I guess) of played EQ, I have seen them
do a number of 'emercency patches'.  All that I can remember, save this one,
has been to fix an immediate problem.  None, save this one, has been to
add content.  Which is why I said it seemed unusually for the added of
a new area to be classified as an emergency.  Which is also why I was
wondering if there really was an problem that needed fixing -now- and just
tacked the new zones on with it.  Or if for some reason they really really
needed to get the zones in -now- and if that was the case, why?
