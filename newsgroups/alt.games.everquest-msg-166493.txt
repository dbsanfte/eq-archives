Well, perhaps we can reach a compromise. The tusk theory may still be
applicable, but the answer appears to be related to what kaev suggests: a
display issue. I've been healing my Warrior wife. She is of good Barbarian
stock and my Light Healing spell occasionally doesn't even register on her
health bar. As I've told her many, many times, she has too many HP!

Interesting information regarding the mana efficiency of Inner Fire vs.
Light Healing. At my 17th season, Inner Fire is healing 20hp for a cost of
10 mana (2:1) compared to 32hp for 25 mana (~4:3) of Light Healing. I
suspect this ordering of efficiencies will change when I receive Healing in
2 more seasons.

Thanks, and hope to see you on the battlefield!
