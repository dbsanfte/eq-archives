Ok, so from what I understand when you dye your armor you are actually dying
the slot, not the armor itself, so no matter what you put in that slot
should come out the dyed color, correct?  Well, I dyed my chest slot white
and so far only one robe ever (the one I was wearing when I dyed it) has
been white.  So what's the deal?  Other robes I have put in that slot are a
blackend crystalline robe and a siren scale robe.  Is it possible that these
robes are undyable?  I mean, I could understand if the blackend crystalline
robe is, since it has its color in its name, but what about the other robe?
If this is the case, is there anyway to tell before I buy a new armor piece
whether or not it can be dyed?
