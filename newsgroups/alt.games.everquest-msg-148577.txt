One thing I've noticed about the FP displays, which I haven't seen
mentioned in these threads, is that they have a physical resolution,
because the screen is really made up of little dots.

If the resolution of your application matches the physical resolution
of the FP display, it looks incredibly sharp and clear.  However, with
games I often change resolutions or play different games at different
resolutions for performance reasons.

If the resolution of the application is *different* from the physical
resolution of the FP display, the display has to fudge it by
interpolating adjacent pixel intensities.  This results in aliasing
that really bothers me.

So I love the FP for business applications, but I don't think I
could stand it for games.

Just my 1cp.
