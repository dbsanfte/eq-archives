Ah, don't be intimidated by the bazaar. Also (and this is in *most*
cases, not an ironclad rule) you can cease worrying about getting ripped
off. One of the huge problems a person in your position used to face was
ripoffs in EC or GFay or in the /auction channels. There were lots of
people out there who might advertise something you wanted, and let's say
it was actually going for about 50 PP on average. They would advertise
it, but not give a price. Or in some cases say 150 PP. You, not knowing
any better would ask how much and get told some bullshit price and you
might end up paying it.

The bazaar has mostly done away with that. Every seller has to "compete"
with every other seller if they want any reasonable chance of moving
their wares. This is because of the new bazaar interface. (More on that
below.) Sellers will have mules on line for extended periods. (Sometimes
24/7). So the people who want to charge ripoff prices will have their
prices thrown up in the face of the prospective buyer alongside,
possibly, several other sellers offering the item for a reasonable going
rate. So in most cases, if you see more than one of an item that looks
like a good upgrade for you, and you take the best priced one (or they
are all the same price from different vendors) there's a good chance
you'll be getting a square deal, if not a very tastey bargain.

Your case is a perfect example of who benefits from this the most. You
have 500 PP to spend and seriously need to upgrade your gear with lots
of room for improvement. You also haven't been playing that long, and it
sounds like you don't have a ton of in game friends or a guild. In the
old system, you would be a sheep waiting for the shearing. These ripoff
artists will often come in here and try to defend their tactics in one
of two ways: First, they say "haggling is an old tradition in markets
and is very in character and roleplaying".  And/or they use the
traditional fallback, "An item in the EQ economy has no set price. It is
worth what the buyer is willing to pay and the seller is willing to
accept and what it is worth to each of them..." blah blah blah.

You are the kind of buyer who puts the lie to that. If you decide that a
+5 INT earring is a really nice upgrade for you, and start looking
around, you might (during a busy time) have found a few people willing
to sell you one for 100 plat. You say you play in off times... so you
log on and there's just one scumbag online selling one and he wants 200
plat and convinces you that it's a good price because you are
inexperienced. You buy it, and a couple hours later see several folks
selling them for 100. You've just wasted 100 plat (or 20% of your total
fortune) because of this shithead. And he didn't care that you weren't
just a "motivated buyer with money to burn". He'd still take your 200
plat and try to justify it as above. The bazaar has put an end to these
dishonest practices for anyone willing to go there and use it.

Now, as to how... when you are in the bazaar and type in /bazaar you get
the search interface, which I'm sure you've seen. Keep your inventory
window open at the same time. You are a necro, so you're likely looking
for either +Mana, +INT, or focus effect items. You can restrict your
search in the pulldown menus to just your class, then one of the above
attributes. Do them all, scrolling through the list of what's for sale.
When you see an item in your price range, right click on it and check
out what it's stats are. With your Inventory window open, you can
quickly check what stats you currently have in that slot and jot down
how much it is, the name, and what slot it's in. Go through the whole
list of what's for sale for each attribute. If you take your time it
will be worth it and you can (relatively) quickly come up with a
shopping list of where you will get the most bang for your buck to
upgrade your kit. You'll likely also find stuff that nobody here would
think to suggest. I've bought stuff I never *heard* of that were
upgrades for me since the bazaar opened.

Good luck and good shopping. If you have more questions, join the
serverwide.age:age channel and maybe somebody from here will be online
to help you if any of it gets really confusing.
