Hello all

First a little background..I have played EQ2 since launch and currently have 
a 22 Swashbuckler.  I have soloed a good number of quests and enjoy the 
challenge of doing so.  Yes I have died a good number of times..but the 
satisfaction of completing the quest overrides that.  There are times that 
another character or a guildmate has offered to help..help I readily 
accepted..I'm no dummy.  Yes there are some quests that you need a good, 
well balanced group to do..and those are fun as well.

The trick to soloing for me is libral use of my heroic opportunities and the 
knowledge how best to use my character's skills.

I think that the people who are looking for something that EQ2 does not give 
them should move on to another game, continue to send SOE messages about 
improvements they would like, or..if they are going to continue to play 
EQ2..stop whining and play the game.

just my 2 cents,

Dave
