What shocked me more was that nobody even commented on his opening
gambit of saying "... I would *guess* maybe half of the players solo
most or all of the time."

I know there's a lot of druids around, but hardly half the population.
Most of the population is incapable of soloing past level 30 or so, and
even of the ones who can, a huge slice of them are in guilds and group a
lot anyway. It's a social game designed for grouping. VI didn't build a
single person shoot 'em up game for a reason. Face facts. If you're
lucky enough to be able to solo some, good for you. I do too. But don't
expect VI to do anything to support that. It's not part of The Vision.
