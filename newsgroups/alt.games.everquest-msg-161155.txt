I had no difficulty understanding your point, but the way you put
it so personally was way more interesting than the point itself.
If you weren't such a sober regular contributor I probably would
have seized upon that lovely opening where you complained about
only having PoP for one of four accounts, but a gentle poke over
taking my observations personally seemed more appropriate.

The current irritations will doubtless go on for some time.  And,
of course, it's important to give SOE feedback about them in-game
and thru the developer's corner channel on their website.  But
eventually, one way or another, everybody's gonna have /raid.
And when they do, it'd sure be nice if SOE's really gone and made
it work well, instead of this idiotic tight loot control for all
of two minutes bullshit they have now.  It should lock the corpse
until it poofs, and the raid leader should be able to designate
looters for specific corpses during that time, as opposed to only
before the mob is killed.  And if they did it right there would be
no need for any looter to be a member of the raid, i.e. the raid
leader targets corpse and types "/lootpermission Zinphandel".

BTW, I find your website to be useful, easy to navigate, and quick
to load.  Amazing how well the web can work when you don't go out
of your way to sabotage it like all those ignorant yahoos out there
who seem to assume that everybody is running a 2GHz machine with
$900 video, $300 sound, a private T1 connection, and no security
concerns.  Thanks for putting it out there for us.
