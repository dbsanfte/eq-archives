So you admit its not a new thread, and you were wrong once again?
That is the way you want things, isn't it- any claim not responded to
is "proven" right?

Interesting, you accuse others of confusing reality with RPG
characters, but now you use the term "a persona on a newsgroup", which
implies that this is just a role you are playing, and that "EQ" is not
a real person.   Maybe you should see a shrink about this, the term is
called "projection".

Oh, but straight boys are so much fun!   They are real wimps at first,
but once they learn to take it like a man they really get into it.
In fact you remind me of a "straight" guy I converted a few years
ago.... anything you want to share with us?
