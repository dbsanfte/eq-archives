Ooops, bad answer.

If you've been here a long time, then you know that on most newsgroups, 
top posting is frowned on, and further that even though there are a few 
groups where its tolerated or even encouraged, that it still doesn't 
make people happy on the other groups where its not.  An experienced 
usenet user (even a moderately experienced one) knows enough to read 
thru some of the back content of a group before beginning to post, to 
get an idea of what the "rules" are on that group.

Thus, your top posting and failing to back down when called on it is a 
deliberate slap in the face of what few social norms do function on usenet.

OR

You are in fact new to Usenet, and just talking shit thru your hat.

Conclusion, you are a jerk, or you are a jerk.

If you had attempted to defend top posting on its own merits, then I'd 
have happily argued the point, but you managed to skip that step 
entirely, thanks for saving me the effort.  If you happen to be an 
ignorant jerk as opposed to a rude jerk, you can google up arguements on 
the topic, I along with dozens of others on this group alone have posted 
them dozens of times.
