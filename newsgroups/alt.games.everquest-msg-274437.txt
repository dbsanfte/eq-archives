While I am not saying this story is in any way untrue, what we do not hear
is if there had ever been any similar incidents in the past.  Having been in
a situation similar to this on more than one occasion, I can say that the
removal from the guild was the result of a "last straw" type situation.

In my case, the individual had been spoken to more than once about his
behavior, in one case he had been killing both Misty Thicket guards and
Ak'Anon guards, something that was specifically precluded in our charter.
We were a "Good" guild and such actions reflected negatively on us as a
whole.  After repeated warnings, he refused because "the exp is TOO damn
good!"  So, he was removed.  This person then proceeded to bad mouth the
rest of us individually and as a group to anyone who would listen.  So...

While this may have been his first and only infraction, he, like many of us,
may be putting the best spin on it he can to garner sympathy from the group
and make himself feel better about what he brought upon himself.

Now, Loon, before you get defensive, I am not saying that this is the case,
just pointing out, for those of us who where not there and witness to the
incident, that there may be another side to the story that we do not have.

Just tossing another perspective into the pot.

Fingon etal.
