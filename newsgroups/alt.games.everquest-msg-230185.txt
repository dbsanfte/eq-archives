Feh, we tossed out one idiot and elected in an even bigger idiot.
Repealed a licensing fee that was put in place as a safeguard for when
the state went into financial crisis, then was shocked and had to

good number of people off who were obsessed over the idea that it was
racist to do that... *sigh*
