  It isn't really worth it to try to raise your faction in Erudin, when
you've got such good faction with the heretics of Paineel which are so
near by, and you've also probably got acceptable faction with the druid
ring spell merchant.

  Besides, I wouldn't call venturing to Erudin "spreading your wings."
;)  Paineel and Erudin are practically neighbors (albeit unfriendly
ones).  Now that you're level 9, you can go invisible and hop on the
boat in Erudin and make your way to Qeynos, if you want.  Qeynos faction
is a lot easier to build than Erudin faction, and there's an underground
that will accept you just fine.  You still will have to dodge a few
named NPCs, though.
