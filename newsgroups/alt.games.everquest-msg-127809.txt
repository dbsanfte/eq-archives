Heh. I just spent about a week in GF and never saw more than one other
person hunting there. The most people I ever saw in the zone at one
time was 12 and they were headed to AC.

If you're going to hunt the stuff in GF, hunt inside the mines that
lead to AC. The grimling miners drop the stuff about 10x as often as
random grimlings in the villages.
