Good post so far. Had to jump in here though and mention that I don't
think the old engine has ever been replaced. It has been upgraded
quite a bit.. the classes tweaked this way and that.. but the core is
still relatively the same. The very first time they really tried a
real engine overhaul was the graphics engine via DX9. And in doing so,
they nearly killed the game. Being a programmer.. i can tell you for a
fact that changing an engine is no easy feat. Imagine this.. you want
to create a new model of Porche.. you've got all these fancy ideas and
nifty new doo-dads... and you'd like it to work off new technology..
but when you go to put it in you have to hookup everything from the
current engine to the old chasis and what not. Every connection has to
match up or it breaks the game in any number of ways that have to be
addressed. And, in the case of new technology.. you may have parts
that have no direct equivalent in the old technology. Its really a
nightmare and EQ is getting a small taste of it having to rework the
collision aspects for the new graphic engine.

As such.. if you really get to the point where you truly overhaul the
engine with new technology.. most of the time its better if you just
overhaul the game. That's what makes EQ2 great.. its completely new
stuff without all the old stuff in the way. Whether or not it will
turn out to be an enjoyable game is another thing entirely :>.

>People tiring of the content.  So make new content.

What i'm hearing is they weren't tiring of the content... they were
tiring of the bugs bringing progress to a glacial pace. Uqua was
particularly painful for a lot of guilds.

>Old graphics.  So replace them.  They've already done this several times 
>and forecast doing more of it.

And nearly killed themselves on the DX9 change.

Boy.. i second those ideas. I've been away for a while myself and i'll
probably be coming back in a couple weeks.. but i really can't think
of what i'd do with myself other than play EQ. I may also start over
from scratch.. i want to do some game engine mapping without worrying
about high-end content for a while since they're gonna be in the
process of debugging the high-end game for a while..

There are others? *blank look* :>

Great post.
