Grachnist can spawn at many points in the Goblin Fort and elsewhere in 
WW. Fabled Grachnist can spawn at all the same points. That is *not* 
typical of named mobs.

The Ishva was a spawn in splitpaw at only one point in the zone, its 
fairly safe to assume he'll only pop at one point now that he's in SK. 
As a result, the fabled and the regular share the one point, and cannot 
be up at the same time.

The real question biz is what do you need the Ishva for that badly 
anyway?
