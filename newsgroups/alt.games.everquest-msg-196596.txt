Hold on, then I'd say "it should be easy to find mobs from 6 to 24 that you can solo or pair on for
decent exp.  From 25 to 30 you'd be stuck with the bandits, and probably competing with 50 others
trying the same thing."

Paladul, starting at the Shadeweaver side, has some very low level mobs in it; the trilobite
looking things (mud burrowers et al) which are non social melee only mobs that don't proc crud.
Killing these mobs you get exactly the same outlandish (200%?) ZEM that you do on the bandits later
in life.

My 9 year old did two levels as a beastlord in there on my advice, and her beastlord was utterly
untwinked, not one thin copper from daddy.  (my 6 year old son's characters tend to be twinked out
with a couple hundred pp in gear and a good weapon, but she's more hardcore)  Its not hard, and the
exp is much better than shar val or shadeweaver for same level mobs.  The tricky part comes when
you get up to the fungusbeast mobs, which are social and get that nasty crud, without a healer or
source of regen that can get very ugly indeed.  But a partnership can take them fairly easily, or a
solo with cure disease can just wait till a little higher level before going after them.
