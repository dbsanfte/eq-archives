Too true!

Fortunately my wife is addicted to EPL Football and watches hours and hours
of games!

And EQ prevents me from blowing money on movies, clubs, gasoline, bridge
tolls and other things that involve leaving the house. I get just as much
satisfaction from socializing with a bunch of virtual folks from around the
world as I did from hanging at the local club trying to have a conversation
with my friends over the noise of some Limp Bizquik wannabe band.

I also watch a lot less TV and when I tire of EQ I am more inclined to pick
up a book. I also get to listen to my CD collection as I play and if I have
one too many shots I don't have to drive home.

My computer skills have increased a little. Editing the eqclient.ini,
running log parsers, seeing packet transfer rates, etc.

The downside - I have seen too many younger players who should be studying,
partying, socializing and dating get hooked.

Oh well, like any other of life's pleasures there are dangerous extremes.
