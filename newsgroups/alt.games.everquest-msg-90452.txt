Char is a 54 HE Warrior The half elf part is important the the rest of
this.

No problem doing everything up to and including getting the Pen Key
No. 7 from the cat on the island (Nomala)

Give the key to Grahan Rothgar in the basement area of the Arena in S
Qeynos.....get exp....

Get message from him bla bla bla..".proven to be a true warrior. I
salute you. You can be of some assistance to me. It seens as though
there has been a [second escaped gladiator] and I have a reward
waiting for a HUMAN (my caps) warrior.

I say " I will find the second escaped gldiator."

Grathan won't give be the next quest, the Minotaur bit.  Instead I get
back cat quest again.

Noticed, I am Half Elf.....He says..."reward for human"

I have done the key thing twice, same results.

Any advice plz
