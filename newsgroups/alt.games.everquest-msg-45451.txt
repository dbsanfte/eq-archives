Unfortunately I've discovered that when ordering from a company that is not
well known to have great customer service, who cares about the products.
I'd rather take a slightly larger chance at having to send something back
but have a good time doing it than take little chance but end up having to
return something to customer service from hell.  The main thing I've
realized with almost all companies is that when they're small and needing
customers, their customer service is usually great.  But as soon as they get
bigger they suck and try to see who can suck the hardest.

Also even though its off topic, I have an edited (info same, personal
information such as phone numbers, addresses, names, and case numbers have
been removed, dates, times, events are all the same) 7 page text document
which I documented case notes of each time trying to call SWBell to get my
DSL line and services relocated to my new address.
