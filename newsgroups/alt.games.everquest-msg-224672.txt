Pally = low DPS
Pally = low DPS
Enchanter animation = low DPS
Enchanter nukes = low DPS
Enchanter DOT = wow your group must have low DPS if you have time for DOTs
Ranter = your only high DPS character in this group

Druids nuking = medium DPS, but you don't list them, because as we 
feared they were too busy healing.

Enchanter CHARMED pet = high DPS by the way.  If there's something to 
charm and if you are good at managing a charmed pet.

To  improve this group, have one druid plus one paladin covering heals, 
the second druid providing DPS, the enchanter using a charmed pet for 
more DPS.  If the MA paladin is good at lull your enchanter should be 
free to concentrate on handling his pet plus nuking, and if the mobs are 
dying faster, then a druid with paladin backup should be sufficient to 
keep up with heals.  Three DPS classes instead of one would help a lot.

Yesterday I did LDoN with this group:

Paladin
Paladin
Rogue
Beastlord
Necromancer
Magician.

No healer at all.  However, the two paladins plus beastlord are all 
hybrid healers, and with 4 serious DPS classes operating the mobs were 
falling too fast to hurt us much, we chewed thru single pulls at an 
incredible rate, and only the rare multiple pull gave us serious pause 
in the healing department; even here, with 7 potential tanks, 5 with 
dedicated healer (the beastlord counts as two tanks but only one 
dedicated healer) and the necro capable of mezzing at least a couple 
adds, it really wasn't too hard.  Despite the lead paladin declaring 
when we went in that success would be impossible and we were just going 
for the exp, we finished the mission in 45 minutes of the allotted 90, 
then proceded to stay and clear out every remaining mob we could find in 
the place in the bonus half hour.
