Actually...I am jewish, and I laugh at jewish jokes...I also laugh at jokes
about other races and religions.  This post however was not a joke.  You
don't just go crossposting messages like that to spread a joke...you are
tying to send a message.  Jews, Catholics, Hindus...it don't matter...no one
is better than anyone else, but what do you think would happen if I cross
posted a similar message about if Hollywood Christians made "Schindler's
List"? People would be up in arms against that too I bet.  The point is that
this guy was trying to stir the pot...and obviously he did. Next time if he
wants to make a joke...which I am positive this wasn't...he should just
leave religion out of the mix.  Of course, making jokes like that will
always offend "someone".
