As for the anti-begging policy
> when i first got into EQ and noticed that was a skill it astonded me
> that ppl would actually beg,

The begging that people were talking about is real begging from other
players.  It's really annoying and everyone hates it.  If you need to ask
for help, don't ask for money or gear, just politely ask questions,
directions or maybe for a buff or two.  Many people when encountering a true
new newbie (kinda rare these days) are more than willing to part with some
gear that is not worth selling in the bazaar but good enough that they hate
to sell it for the few gold a merchant will pay for it.  BUT they hate to be
asked for it, they would rather make the offer.

The begging that is a skill in-game is pretty useless.  You can use this
skill to beg from NPC's but it hardly ever works and when it does you just
make a few coppers. Don't waste your time on it, you are better off spending
your time levelling.
