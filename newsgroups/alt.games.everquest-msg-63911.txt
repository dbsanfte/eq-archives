Well, my experience with ATI's driver-writing abilities leaves a lot to be
desired.  I couldn't get the right driver for the longest time & then I
finally found it on a non-ATI related site, archived & practically buried by
dust & the mists of time :o)

Whereas, getting the latest driver for my Hercules card hasnt been a problem
yet.  It has actually be the VIA 4-in-1's that have caused me the most
problems with EQ.  Tho, now that I have the latest ones of those, that isn't
even a problem.
