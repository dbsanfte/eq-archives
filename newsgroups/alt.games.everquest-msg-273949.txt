I don't actually read the magazine. I agree the name is likely a 
pseudonym.

Checking for accuracy is alway meritous.

The etymology of pussy relating to vagina and or woman is already

You are confusing word usage with etymology. They are not the same 
thing. She never provided an etymology for wimp, merely observed its 
usage in a (regrettably undisclosed) source from 1920. But I'm willing 
to accept the the source and usage as likely to be correct.

I disagree.

Etymology isn't word usage. Consider 'bellyacher' it means complainer. 
Its first usage was to describe someone who complained a lot... but the 
etymology is literally "stomach pains".
 
Unless someone can find an actual cite linking fluffy kitty cats to 
cowardice I beleive 'Blanch' is on target.

Cats are frequent metaphors for soft/furry (likely the tie-in to female 
genitals), curiousity, playful, vicious (catty/cat fight/hissy fit), and 
aloof. Never are they portayed as cowardly. 

Women on the otherhand are disparagingly linked to cowardice routinely.

'Blanche's' full article covers this. The use as endearment has come and 
gone, and is obsolete. I doubt it really has any bearing on this 
discussion.

Consider the timeline:

Pussy as endearment, rises and disappears.
Pussy as vagina rises and persists
Pussy as cowardice rises and persists

Since pussy as coward doesn't predate pussy as vagina, and pussy as term 
of endearment fell out of use before pussy as vagina arose, its highly 
unlikely the term of endearment was revived and then converted to an 
insult, when an insulting usage already existed that the derivation 
makes perfect sense.... Occams razor.

'Once upon a time'. A usage of the word that died out a century ago 
should likely not be assumed in an online video game when spouted off by 
a teenager.

But you likely have as 'little bitch', 'bitched', 'went down like a ho', 
...At least I have. 

Never once have I heard 'little fluffy cat', 'koala bear', 'poodle', or 
any other reference to small cute weak animals when describing mobs that 
were easy to drop.
