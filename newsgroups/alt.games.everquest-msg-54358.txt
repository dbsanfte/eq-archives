Im thinking of kicking off a monk character for those more tranquil
moments.

Passing through all the assorted monk info floating about I've decided how
I am going to spend my stat points etc, but one question still bugs me.

Agnostic or Tranquil? Pretty much every site states that its much of a
muchness as far as overall playability goes. A few mention that as an
Agnostic you dont have enough starting faction to get quests in the other
monk guild (Ashen Order?). This is all very well but I cant really find
the pros to being an agnostic human monk and whether they suit what I want
to do with the character specifically.

So can anyone answer the following. To my mind the advantage of being an
agnostic human is that a lot more people like you and you will be able to
generally wander abut Norrath much more easily and thats what would make
me choose an agnostic monk....so where can an agnostic human monk go that
a Tranquil human monk cant..

I assume Tranquils have a big problem wherever Innouruk worshippers are eg
Neriak and other evil cities.

If the agnostic doent give me enough extra range then I'd go for the
Freeport start.
