Why would you have to put things on a mule?  If you've got too much
stuff to store in the bank you've very likely got too much stuff.  If
you believe that you _need_ all that "stuff" you're deluding yourself,
in fact you _want_ all that "stuff" which is much different, and if it
encumbers your character to carry it around you are weakening yourself
needlessly.

Not being hateful, just not sympathetic to anybody who wants it to be
somebody else's fault that their choices make problems for them,
_especially_ a "grown woman", tho in my experience it's the "grown men"
who are far more prone to this.

My main's stats are decidedly sub-optimal.  So what?  It was my choice,
my problem, and I dealt with it be wearing and carrying gear that fit
within my limitations.  And by not looting anymore when I got up close
to my limit.

I don't want anybody in my group encumbered, and I expect them to take
care of that issue on their own.  If there is a character in the group
with a strength buff, and if they don't need their mana for more
important things, sure i'll take it.  But I never depend on it to avoid
encumbrance, and I drop loot if necessary should I become encumbered
because I took on extra stuff while STR was available and it is no
longer (buffer LD, or action finally got fast enough that there isn't
spare mana for bullshit buffs).

Symbols are rarely useful enough during normal hunting to justify the
mana cost (raids are different).  The exceptions are the MT when there's
a cleric using CHeal, an enchanter anytime, and a druid who is primary
healer.  When no cleric is in the group I'll symbol an enchanter or
druid primary healer even when I'm not bothering to symbol myself.

For ordinary xp grind type play what you want is AC on the MT (and
off-tank if you need one), buffs that help damage output, buffs that
do mana or health regen, and buffs that help agro control.  Other buffs
are counter-productive (increasing downtime) if mobs are plentiful
enough  that you don't have to wait for mobs to spawn between pulls.
