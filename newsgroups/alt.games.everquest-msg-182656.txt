I'm thinking it might not be "new" but they might have found they can
do a zone specific effect and giving the bridles "lizard mount"/lizard
mount form in all LOY zones instead of it being a horse. They probably
were doing the LOY zones and were about to put the horse/luclin player
models into the loy zones (has to be put into each zone file to be
loaded for that zone) and someone said,

"hey.. lets make them lizard mount things for LOY zones"

I could be wrong though and its a specific lizard item, but I somehow
doubt it. A player who spent 100 k plat for a hose would feel hosed
then, while if their horse was simply a lizard thing in LOY zones
they'd feel cool.
