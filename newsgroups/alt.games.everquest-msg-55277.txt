I've spent at least 8 hours in EK with my 3 chars during the events there.  
I don't think there is an Undead Dragon.  Isn't that in Rathe?  I never 
ventured close enough to see him, but I heard the bad guy in EK was a huge 
Spec.

My 9th level cleric had no problems in EK ( except 1 death ) because of all 
the people there killing things.  If he got hit, he cast that 
Invulnerability spell, and ran like mad towards the bridge and someone 
happily grabbed the mob off of my ass.  My 21st warrior never came close to 
dying.  34th chanter didn't either, and could have made a killing off of 
Clarities.

We had over 150 people there, about 20 minutes after the events would 
start, so maybe that was the difference.

I'm probably taking the chanter to Rathe to check that out.  Or, to Qeynos 
Hills to take out Varsoon and try to score another GBS, since I just sold 
my last one.
