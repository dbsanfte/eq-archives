    I dont know if never using the same texture twice is what's required,
even a bit of difference in texture/shape in the objects we're likely to use
as landmarks would help. The huts in east commons help a lot, even though
they're all the same because their orientation differs. If they could just
paint them a different shade or make some wider or smaller we'd be laughing
I reckon.
