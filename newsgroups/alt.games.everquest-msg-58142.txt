I play on an NEC 1525V monitor.  It looks pretty good on this thing.  The
only thing I had trouble with at first was that some of the settings for
chat made the colours a little too bright.  I'm not sure if this was a
contrast problem or if it's because this monitor is brighter than my old
tube monitor.  In any case, I just made some minor adjustments to my chat
colours and everything has been fine since.
