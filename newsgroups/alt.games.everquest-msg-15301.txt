From what I've seen, the first 2,000 people on a virgin server are people who
have played for a while and are anxious to become the first level 60 of their
class. I know that was the case when Lanys opened up a few months ago; one of
my friends was unemployed at the time and became (to the best of his
knowledge) its first 50th level necro. While he didn't do any trade skills,
one of his friends who moved with him had the goal of becoming one of the
first master tailors and make a killing on packs. And he did.
