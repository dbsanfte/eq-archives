I found, in the case of at least one higher level disease, that it
worked the same as Cure Poison requiring multiple casts against tougher
poisons.  You had to cast the "Cure Disease" three times to remove the
particular effect.  It always worked on the third cast, and never
worked on the first or second.  I think that's what Celaeno is
referring to.
