/Agreed

The new travel system sucks too. 

Totally disagree.  IMO the only reason people think it sucks is because it
makes things too easy.

>Teleporting wizards and druids didn't suck. 

Agreed.  *But* I hated strangers sending me tells at 4 oclock in the morning
needing an *emergency* port for a corpse run because they forgot they were
bound on a different continent or couldn't find anyone to bind them.... I doubt
there are any druids or wizards looking forward to *that* again.  

The spires didn't suck

The Karanas are a perfect example of that..... no one realized they could be
bound in the gypsy camp - and of course you had to *get there alive first*
before you could get bound there, provided there was someone who *could* bind
you nearby.
I thought the spires sucked at a 5 on a level of 1 - 10.  I would routinely
bring my druid to port my friends, then re-log while someone got THEIR porter
to port my ranger to meet us.  It was certainly faster than waiting on the
spire.  When we get ready to go we want to *go*.
