  Enh...so did I, actually. It was close to 2 AM when I posted, and I was 
feeling kind of cranky after a day filled with seeing things like "it's"

I didn't mean to offend you. Should I like, change my 
attitude? Should I change my whole way of  being? Huh? 
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. BITE ME HARD!"
