I can't answer for the higher level game, but at low to mid 30s, no wizard,
no enchanter, one warrior, one rogue, one sk, one bard, one druid, and one
shaman.  Pulls were constant, puller was bringing in the next mob before the
first one hit the ground, pulling blues, most mobs didn't even have time to
do one bubble of damage to the warrior.  It's hard to imagine how that could
have been sped up much, we were not taking any med breaks, did get clarity
once during that time from a nearby enchanter.
