Perhaps, but apparently not everyone agrees with that. After all, the
Sleeper has been awakened on how many servers? Content is meant to be
played.

I don't recall the post, but you're overstating the contrast - there
isn't any.

Certainly, breaking an agreement isn't honorable. But anyone who
thinks that a few hundred other total strangers in a virtual world are
going to abide by an agreement indefinitely is nothing short of a
fool. The content exists, it's going to be played. To complain when it
happens is, indeed, sour grapes.
