Your 14 mobs puts my best kite to shame, which was 3 Frost Giants and
5 Drakkel Dire Wolves.  I did this using the swarm/charm kite.  Ever
since I started swarm kiting with charm, the XP has been fast.  It's
great cause the other mobs do the damage for you.  I think my swarm
took less than 10 minutes to complete.
