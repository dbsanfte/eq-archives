Just an observation, (not an attack/defense of any practice) a lot of zones
have real screwy pathing. Take for instance Kerra Isle, If you nuke a mob 10
paces in front of you, they do not run directly to you and will in fact run
away for a time, take a detour then decide to close. They take a curcuitous
route seemingly custom designed to aggro as many other nearby Kerrans as
possible, and will easily travel 50 paces to close the ten paces to you.
There are no obstacles.

I have notices a similar thing in the warrens (overlooking a stream) where
to make matters worse there is a z-axis issue where you can't even see what
the dang things are doing. Nuke one and create your own train which you
won't see till it's on your doorstep.

I have never seen any benfit from this, but have sure been hindered a great
deal. Maybe you can update your rule of thumb to:

    "A mob should never run away from you to get closer, unless it is
screwing you over"
