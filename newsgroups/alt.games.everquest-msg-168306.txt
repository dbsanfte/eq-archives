My point is, though, that while he is free and perfectly entitled to
charge up front (I honestly don't have a problem with it), he
shouldn't expect everyone to like it and call anyone who doesn't an
asshole. It may be his way of doing things, but it's not how everyone
does them. Pissing and moaning about how they don't trust him is
pretty stupid when he just proved that he doesn't trust them either. 

So, charge for ports up front. Fine. Just don't be so shocked and
snippy when people don't want to ride with him because of it. Accept
it and move on. It's not worth stressing over.
