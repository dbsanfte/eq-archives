Fine, you get to die with your gas mask in hand, unable to lift it to 
your head before the nerve agent takes effect.  I get to die with a beer 
in my hand.  We're both dead.  At least I'm dead while living the way I 
wanted to live.

The measures you advocate are as effective as "duck and cover" would be 
against a nuclear attack.  Of course, "duck and cover" was invented just 
so people would have the delusion that they had something they could do 
to protect themselves...

The best defense is knowing your neighbors.
