Last time I hunted a bit in The Grey, I was bound in Scarlet Desert.  It's
quite a long trek from SD to somewhere that I can get some scales.  I could
go to Katta to bank, but it's a pain to cross SD and Twilight Sea without
levitate.

The reason those spells are nice is that it is not always convenient to run
to a bank or a merchant to get scales or wings.
