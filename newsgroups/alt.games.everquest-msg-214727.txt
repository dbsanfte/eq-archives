The extra bank slots, cartography system, LFG tool, Guild Management
tool, and new spells are useful, but on E'Ci the new zones are already
deserted.  So, unless you're high level or can find a mid level guild
that actually does something, you probably won't get much enjoyment
from them.  If you're willing to pay $22 for the UI enhancements it's
worth it.  But if you're looking for gameplaying skip to LDoN.
