Hard to say. 

Voice acting works best in linear games.

The later Wing Commanders for example which were virtually interactive 
movies + space sims, and the voice acting was comparatively engaging.

But the voice overs in DiabloII were also very well done and even so 
people rarely listened to them twice. 

Everquest is a very nonlinear game. It will be difficult to make 
extensive use of voice acting -and- set it up such that players only 
hear it once.

And it its indicative of the value of that content if players only -
want- to hear it once. The average raid event most players will 
participate in willingly multiple times. (Perhaps not the dozens that 
some require), but few, if any of us have even read the wayfarers tales 
as they are related the first time, nevermind read them twice.

Ultimately its because the 'plot' they relate to us is virtually 
completely irrelevant to all aspects of game play, which is a failing of 
EQ imo.
