Shaman, like many other classes, should not need healing.  Like
Necromancers, its tricky to tell when they -do- need healing, as they are
busily, happily, spending HP to get mana and then mana to get HP and
making a killing on the points spread.

Two things a shaman should do to help their fellow healers out with this
process.  First, establish a "I never canni below this percentage" point.
If you notice the shaman is at 20% hp but has told you she never canni's
under 30%, you can assume she's in trouble and needs a heal; it may be
because she's taking a beating or is DoTTed or even because her mana is in
such an emergency situation that she's gone into her safety reserve... but
she agrees not to be pissed at you for healing if she's under that point,
and not to be pissed at you for NOT healing any time she's over that
point.

Second, make a hotkey that says "heal me if you can".  Direct tell to the
healer is best, its easier to notice in the general spam of an oncoming
disaster.  Open to the group or raid works too, though, especially if
there is a  spot healer handy who might also be able to cover; ranger,
paladin, beastlord in a group, druid, shaman, other grouped cleric in a
raid.

The third thing, though, is to accept death with some degree of calm.  Its
simply NOT the other healer's job to keep everyone alive, and rarely is
the shaman the number one priority.  There's one healer in every group or
raid who's the principle person in charge of keeping a shaman alive, and
thats the shaman herself.  Don't get aggro if you can avoid it, ditch
aggro when you get it if you can't handle it, use self heals, including
Stoicism/Torpor to stay alive if you must tank.  Outside help is necessary
from time to time, but it May not be available, there's the MT, CC, and
Cleric ahead of you in line, all potentially vital to the entire group not
wiping.  Only time a shaman might expect heals (rather than just hope for
them) is on incoming if the MT isn't very good at grabbing aggro and the
shaman is getting pounded on slow, or worse on slow resist.

There's nothing I appreciate more than someone who dies and then sends me
a tell saying that not healing them was the right decision.  I mean, I
usually Know it was, but its nice to have that confirmed, since there's
always a nagging feeling I might have done things differently and saved
them too.  In the end though, when a group wipes down to my cleric and the
chanter and we get it back together and kill all the mobs after all, its
pretty clear that this -was- the only way.
