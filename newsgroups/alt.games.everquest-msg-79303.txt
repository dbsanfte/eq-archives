If giving helpful advice, though it not all be on-topic, is pathetic in 
your world, I'm glad I'm not in it, kiddo.

What -is- pathetic is that a high percentage of your posts have -no- 
helpful content whatsoever.  Instead, they normally contain 1 or 2-liners 
that are attempts to belittle someone with vulgarities.  One must assume 
that this makes you feel better about yourself, as that fits the rest of 
your profile that you exhibit here.
