I know, our guild just doesn't have a lot of high level characters to put a
good group together.  But I do have 2 - 65 Rogues who have offered to help
me which I am greatly thankful to them for this.  And yes I know it is a LOT
easier to get then the shattered emerald.  Since everytime Innurok *sp*
spawns, some large raid is taking place and it is either a closed raid OR
the raid is for a single Ranger to get the emerald.  Just hoping that by the
time I hit 60 with my Ranger, I'll be able to get a raid together to hit him
and see if he drops it.  I have heard the drop is very rare and a Ranger
told me out of 7 Raids he has been on he has not seen it drop once.  You'd
figure that having to do this last part of the epic for earthcaller, Innurok
*sp*, would drop the emerald more often.  But what do I know, I only been
playing since sept of last year and average 14 hours a day playing.
hehehehehe
