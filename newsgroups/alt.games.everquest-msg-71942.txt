Now I'm really going to sound dumb - but what do you refer to as 'gm' (guild
member, game master, etc.?)  Chances are though, the answer is no :)

I read the hobbit a long time ago and assumed that the movie was based on
that .  I didn't know that a triology of books was written beyond that.  As
for dungeons and dragons, that I've heard of only through games such as
baulders gate etc. I wasn't aware that they were rated books of the century
either (mainly because I didn't know they exisited :o  )

While I enjoy fantasy time games / movies etc I never really got "into
them".  EQ I like simply because I like helping others and as a cleric that
role suits me perfectly (random complete heals etc. make a warriors day
   )

Anyhow, I'll ease up on this topic and perhaps head over to the movie site
to dig up some more information.  It's unlikely I'll end up reading the
books now that I can just watch the movie <g>

Cheers!
