I'm not a newb.  I have nearly 57 days into my main, born in Oct 2001.
I'm a loyal, enthusiastic, and....casual player who lives for the
thrill of large raids.  I'm also the member of a very active family
guild, which runs DKP raids 3 nights a week, and open raids on the
other 4 nights.  As such, opportunities to grind XP are few and far
between.

I just dinged 65 this afternoon on MM XP.  I'm tickled pink.  1 more
XP level and I'm going on an AA defensive binge like Bob Barker
chasing hotties in the backstage hallway of a Miss America pageant.

From where I sit, MM XP looks to be more of a boon to players such as
myself, than a way to exploit the designs of the game.

Best regards,
