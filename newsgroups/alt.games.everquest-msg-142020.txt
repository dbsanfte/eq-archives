I never made the statement you attribute to me, but I see that didn't
stop you from referring to it as if I had, and throwing in some more
insulting BS while you're at it.  I "gave up" because your posts made
it abundantly clear that you had no intention of expending the least
bit of thought to understand what was being expressed.  Just for the
hell of it, I'll take a minute to walk you through, (tho I'll be
surprised if you manage to "get it" now that you're in full defensive
mode):

To quote the first line of my first reply:
/quote
Relative closeness depends on how you're viewing the classes.
/quote
The key here is "view".  The relationships between most any group of
"things" may look different, depending on how you're viewing them.
Different views allow you to ascertain complementary (i.e. not opposed)
"truths" about the group, the combination of which give you a more
complete understanding of the group as a whole (anybody who's ever done
any serious software design had better be saying "well, duh" about now).

So, to the matter at hand...

The most common way to view the relationships between the classes we're
considering is to see the Cleric/Druid/Shaman as a group, related in
game mechanics by their total reliance on WIS-based spell casting for
their power (except at low level), and related in RP context by their
presumed common function as the spiritual leaders of their societies.
In contrast, the Paladin is seen primarily as a melee fighter in game
terms, and as a defender of society in RP context.  From this angle the
Druid and Shaman appear closer to the Cleric than the Paladin.  This
view is so common that I saw no need to mention it explicitly.

The view Dan and I are referring to sees the Cleric/Paladin as a group,
related in game mechanics by the sharing of many spells that no other
class gets, and related in RP context by their direct service to a
particular religious tradition under a particular god, centered in a
particular place.  In contrast, the Druid and Shaman wield many magics
that differ greatly from anything the Cleric/Paladin can do while
lacking access to important Clerical powers shared by the Paladin,
and in the RP context the Druid and Shaman live very different lives
in very different societies.  From this angle, the Paladin appears
closer to the Cleric than the Druid or Shaman.

Note that both views contain important, but incomplete, truths.  Note
that neither view opposes the other.

My point is neither flawed, nor ignorant.  Your mischaracterization of
my post was, otoh, both flawed and ignorant.  I suggested that you
might have deliberately missed my point because, frankly, it's not
obscure.  Given the evidence at hand, I can only assume that you
preferred launching a gratuitous insult based on a superficial reading
of my post to giving the matter actual thought.
