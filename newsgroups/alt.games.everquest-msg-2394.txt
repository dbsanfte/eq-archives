I will totally agree that they need to work on their implementation of patches. But
being a programmer myself, I know how difficult it can be to tell from a relatively
small beta test what will break when the new stuff goes live. I get frustrated as
<censored>, but I can understand why they may need to make minor fixes after big
patches.

MY big beef is when Verant refuses to take responsiblity for what has happened. I
have seen entire zones get dumped (Sunday or Sunday I was in Nektulos and tried to
return to EC; I was bounced back with the message that the zone was not available at
the moment. Several others got the same message and the zone was down for about 10
minutes that I know of. No warning was given, no error message, no explaination.) I
have seen entires SERVERS get dumped (last night I went LD around 7pm. When I finally
was able to log in, the server selection showed LESS THAN 800 people on every server,
when an hour before all of them had at least twice that many.)

Every time goes wrong -- EVERY TIME, NO MATTER THE CIRCUMSTANCES -- Verant comes back
with the same answer: "It is YOUR fault, not ours. Blame your modem, blame your ISP,
but do not blame us, or else." I would have far, far more respect for the company if
they would just admit, "We have been having problems implementing feature X; we are
fixing it now." or "Someone hit the main fusebox switch rather than the light switch
and half the servers powered down; everything will be back up in 20 minutes as we
reboot a dozen machines."
