Right, now keep going with that line of thought...

"Today" is the open public beta (if indeed it's still going on), which
is NOT representative of what we'll see when it's been officially
released and running for a while.

Just like when the Stromm server went live.  Rampant kill stealing in
all the newbie areas.  Rampant camp stealing in places like the orc
trainer in Crushbone.

I have no doubt you're right about "today".  Anything you say about
"tomorrow" is a GUESS, and so far your guess seems WRONG to me.  My
experience with the Stromm server is where I get MY conclusions.

A FREE service like Battle.net can't be compared to a PAY service like
EverQuest or WoW and be very accurate.

Yes, I'm guessing too.  I recognize it as such, but I think mine is
slightly more thought out than yours.

No, it hasn't been proven wrong.  Hand waving isn't good enough.  Come
up with a real counter-argument or concede.  Or just refuse to discuss
it, I guess, but that's not very impressive.
