You're off base again.

A person can only be held liable for slander if the following two conditions
are met:

1)  The information must be totally false.
2)  The person being slandered MUST suffer financially, or have his/her
reputation tarnished, so as to become unable to either:
    a)  Become gainfully employed.
    b)  Maintain a quality of living.

Now, you're going to sit here and tell me that posting something on a public
newsgroup under a ficticious name, to a ficticious character (one "railgun
toting kitty cat", or some such rot) constitutes slander?  You have a lot to
learn about the law, junior.

I'm not coming into this newsgroup shouting "Bomb!", nor am I threatening
the President.  I'm pointing out a bunch of hypocritical behavior by a bunch
of people who play a video game online and claim to be "mature", none of
which will land me in prison.  Think about it.

Now, on to your own warped thinking, and yet more proof that you're not as
smart as you think you are.

I pay my ISP for service.  I don't post through their servers, however.
What you're missing here is that the server I DO post through is a private
server, which means I can (once again) say whatever I want, to whomever I
want, about whatever I want, any time I want.

Class dismissed.
