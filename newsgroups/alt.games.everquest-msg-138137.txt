As a melee, you should max out all your weapons skills and keep them
that way.  This will slow your exp gaining a bit, as you use less effective
weapons and lower than maxed skills.. but in the long run you will
almost certainly be glad you did.

Forget the weapons you have now.  They aren't important.  What
happens a few levels from now when you get a really really good
2hs?  Or a dozen levels from now when you find a 1hb thats twice
as good as any 2hs or 1hs you own?  This sort of thing can happen
to you throughout your entire career.  If you get all your skills maxed
out while you are young, then each time you level you only have
20 skill points to gain, and never with a weapon you aren't already
almost maxed out in for your level.  Compare this to trying to train
up a couple hundred points in 2hb in your 50s, with skills in
that weapon form worthy of any level 3 paladin out there.

All things being absolutely equal, a one handed weapon will
be superior to a 2 handed weapon, since it will allow you use
of a shield for AC and stats.   Rare indeed though are
one handers and two handers with absolutely the same
set of stats.

had a 50 skill in 1hb when my 20/22  1hb Righteousness dropped
at level 54... learned my lesson I did
