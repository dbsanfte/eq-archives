That's also a symptom of the ATI card problem I was talking about earlier.
The card in my laptop met the minimum requirements to play the game, but
there's some issue with the ATI chipset that's either 1) stonewalling them,
or 2) they choose not to address.

For the sake of your sanity, I'd consider NVidia cards if you're getting new
ones.  I'm not saying it's a better card, but it does seem to play nicer
with DX9/OpenGL games.

fwiw ;-)
