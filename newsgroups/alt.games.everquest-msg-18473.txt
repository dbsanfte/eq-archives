Does anyone know "WHY?" Befallen has been redone?  I haven't been there
since the new patch but if there's new DE NPC's in there AND there's new
DE NPC's in EC, perhaps it's the storyline of Innoruuk's daughter getting
the pieces of armour from Befallen, Najena, and one other zone.  You can
read the story on www.everquest.com  I just don't know if it happened
already.  What's the story here?
