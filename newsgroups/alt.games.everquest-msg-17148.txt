The Warrior claimed he could solo the mobs, not a chance but the bard wasn't
to know that he was talking shit. At no point did he state (as I and many
others do) "I was playing *my* bard" indicating that this is an alt and he
would know what other characters are capable of doing. The fault is with the
warrior and warrior only, if he could solo then all he'd need to make things
easier would be anthem de arms, melodic binding and healing twisted, his
down time would be less and with the bard fighting as well the mob would
fall faster than normal. The fact was, he could not solo any of the high end
mobs there he just assumed the bard be able to fear kite and refused to
listen to the Bard saying "I can't, they'll resist" Faunt lays with one
party here, imo.

I have, on occasion, refused to partner people because I did not believe
that together we'd be successful and, unfortunately, people take this as a
personal insult. Receiving a reply like "FU, Warriors suck anyway" is not
uncommon :ï¿½/
