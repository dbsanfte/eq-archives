While there is no hard and fast rule, it is generally accepted that highest roll

wins... and someone would almost certainly say if any other system is
being used, because they will have been screamed at before by people
who didn't understand.

Someone will announce the roll, personally I always wait for someone
else to roll before I do so I'm sure I'm on the same page.

Frequently, although needlessly, someone will roll for a "seed" (not the
correct technical term, but thats what everyone seems to call it) and then
you will roll to that;

thus I say "rolling seed"
/ran 1000

game returns a roll of 567

I say "roll to 567"

we each do
/ran 567

Highest roll wins.

For items that are not "no drop" a common plan is to hold all items
until the group breaks up, then roll all in one shot, so that the
highest wins their choice, the second highest their choice of whats
left, and so forth.

Other plans are "need before greed" in which items are rolled
for only amongst the characters who can actually use them, and
who don't have better; and "once you win something you can't
win anything else till we all have something"

Bergh

ps: for some reason which utterly escapes me, /ran 420 is a popular
assigned range.  Anyone know why?
