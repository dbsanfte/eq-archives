Think of the servers as alternate copies of the world. All of them have the 
same geography, classes, races, etc.

Your character is tied to the server it is created on. You can move it to 
another server, but it costs 50 bucks and you go with *none* of your 
gear(trust me, after level 20 you won't leave the house without your gear 
;)

The two different kinds of servers are PVP and non-PVP. 

PVP means Player versus Player. I would advise against starting out on one 
of these. All of the PVP servers have a name that ends in "Zek".

Non-PVP is an environment where you cannot hurt other players.

Basically, choose any ol' server and start playing. The only thing that 
affected my choice (Drinal) was a bunch of friends who played that were 
already on that server.
