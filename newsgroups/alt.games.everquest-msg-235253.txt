There is no public policy concern in your ability to play a computer game.

Except the person purchasing the platinum has no interest, nor is the person
selling said platinum, in communicating the amount of time spent acquiring
that platinum.  If it took a seller 150 hours to acquire 100k platinum, he's
not going to sell it for more than if he managed to get another 100k in 3
hours.  He's going to sell it for the same amount, because those two
instances of 100k platinum are completely indistinguishable to a purchaser.
No one cares how much time it took to acquire.

But if you really think this argument might fly, let me ask you this:

I'm playing myself a mean game of Baldur's Gate II and its expansion pack on
my computer, and having a rip roaring good time of it.  In fact, I've been
playing cumulatively for 60 hours when suddenly, my hard drive dies.  It's
gone completely, and the data on that drive is unrecoverable.

Now the drive's covered by warranty, so I can get a new drive from the
manufacturer without any problem at all.  The only issue is, that's not what
I want.  I want compensation for the 60 hours I spent on Baldur's Gate II
because I wasn't able to complete that game due to the hard drive failure.
I had invested 60 hours and now it's gone.  If I want to make myself whole
again, I have to spend another 60 hours doing so, and it's the hard drive
maker's fault that I would have to do so.

Do I have a claim, indeed, in your words, a "vested material interest in the
time [I have] put in"?

SOE has never presented EQ as anything more than a computer game.  All it
boils down to is that you're spending your time playing a computer game, and
you won't be able to spin that a different way to a judge.

By the way, I think it's necessary to define our parameters here.  Are we
discussing a hypothetical case where SOE tries to shut down IGE's operations
under the claim of misappropriation of their IP, or are we discussing a
hypothetical case of IGE bringing a suit against SOE claiming that they
can't enforce their EULA the way it currently stands?  The issues aren't the
same by any stretch, and you're totally fucking up the discussion's
coherence by mixing them.
