They have to have problems to do it in ther first place.

Let me get this straight, what your saying is:

"Because I say so."

You don't bother to explain to them why this is so horrible you don't think
their are alternative ways then war?

War = Major loss for them, death to a lot of them.

War also = death of more American's

It hardly teaches anything IMO. I think Japan is the only country to have
ever learned how horrible their actions were.
