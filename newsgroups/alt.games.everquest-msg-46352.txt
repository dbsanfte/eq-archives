Agreed!!!!

We have been. The American public has been put to sleep for that long. These
little problems have been drowned out by Monica-Gate and stupid shit. I
Blame republicans for that just as the conservative majority of the Supreme
Court has decided to take a cheap shot at Clinton in the most tasteless
timing of our history. I blame the media, partisanship, and the other idiots
who continue to try and lull America into this stupily false sense of
safety. I really am encouraged by our sense of unity in the last 3 weeks,
but if a Democratic president had been in office and this event occured, I
am not sure the Republicans would be as cooperative.
