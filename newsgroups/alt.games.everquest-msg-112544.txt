I was curious about the same thing. I see that EQTraders has a troll
in Ogre War Plate, but can't find any info on Troll cultural armoring.
 Can Ogre cultural armor (to be worn by a troll) be made in the Troll
forge in Grobb or does it have to be made in Oggok?

Also, anyone have any good leads on no drop armor a troll SK can wear?
 I've got a troll on Rallos Zek and I figure either no drop armor or
very easy to replace banded is the way to go for those nasty,
unavoiable PK experiences (when bagging skills just aren't fast
enough!).

What's the "skull" (the bp with the skull on it) armor you see the
guards in troll town wearing?

TIA
