Buff up outside to the hilt.  Get invis, zone in, TURN LEFT, run to the west
wall, and wait for the critters.  NO DAUDLING!  NO SIGHTSEEING!

Since you're new to the zone two groups are going to be awfully scary unless
you have at least 2 level 54+ enchanters (for fast-recast mezz), 2 druids
charged to simply keep those 2 enchanters alive, then everyone else.

You're going to have at least 5 critters in camp from the start because many
see through invis.  But yes, you'll want to be invis...or else you'll get
closer to 10. :p

If you've got 2 tank-types, I'd recommend the groups work independently to
get the critters managed faster, plus give the enchanters less work to do.

Folks who can charm might want to consider memming it.  But NOT the druids
charged with keeping the enchanters alive...they'll be too busy.

Fear break-in is fun for veterans...I hated it when I first started going
there, though.
