We're looking at characters that usually run everywhere they go, if not
porting. Mostly at SoW speed. Take a look at the Olympics, see any
runners there that look like this. Those depicted by that artist would
be heaving after 100 meters! In RL, now that's different. In RL, I find
a little extra weight looks healthier. The stick figures you mention
look sickly in my opinion.
