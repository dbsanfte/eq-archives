    This is sort of how I feel about it also.  It is true that the EQ I
am playing now is quite different in terms of looks and content than the
game I started playing a couple of years ago.  I think that alot of the
changes have been for the good, while a few have been regrettable.  But
it just seems to me that they are changing changes on top of old
changes.  Spaghetti code at its finest.  The new EQ, with luck, will
have the benefit of learning the mistakes that were many felt were
problems in EQLive, (for example, not to many people liked the forced
downtime of waiting for a boat every time you wanted to travel, or
seeking out a port) and have them fixed from the onset, and then be able
to grow and adapt as the current  version of EQ has done.  

    I think the graphics are going to be a very obvious way this is
apparent, for example.  Yes, EQLive looks different and better now than
it did when I started.  But from what I have seen, EQII looks simply
amazing.  Not being all that smart or anything, I would hazard to guess
that it is using the better technology that is available today than that
that was available when the original EQ was churned out.  Maybe some of
the game play issues will be fixed too from the start, things like
boring quests that force an interested party to camp a mob for hours at
a time, or how a dedicated tradeskiller might be forced to spend hours
farming greens for the components they need to get those skill ups.
  
   EQII has potential, I believe, and I will be trying it out.  But I
also know that there's a good chance that it will be as big a disaster
as The Sims Online is (One of the worse games I have ever spent money
on).  I won't be deleting any of my girls the day EQII comes out,
whenever that is.
