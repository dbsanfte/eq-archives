    Everquest is a fun, complex game that you might find yourself playing
alot, for years.  Or, it simply might not be your cup of tea or your system
might not be able to handle it.  I think your solution above is the best
way to see about getting in the game.
 
    If you find that your system can handle it, and you do enjoy it, you
might want to check out the Everquest FAQ from this group, which can be
found in my sig.  It's pretty big, but has alot of information that you
might find to be useful.
