I know someone has mentioned this guy in a similar thread a while back, but
the Kromriff Recruiter (I think that's what he is) just inside Kael from
Eastern Wastes is supposed to be level 1.  I took a level 1 troll there once
to drag a corpse, and if I remember right, he did con even to the troll.

I have to add, though, that he's nowhere near as dangerous as the other
baddies named in this thread.  If he starts to pummel you, move away and
he'll just stand there, staring daggers at you.
