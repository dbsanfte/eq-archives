People hardly group/ do things together anymore in UO (IMO).

So, I'd give it a 2.

Asheron's Call 1.. I must have played it wrong, because I never saw anyone
group there.

EQ, was the game where most if not everything went through grouping.

What interests me personally is how many of these mmorpgs have real quests
in them.
(real as opposed to the: fetch 100 skellie bones etc)

I've given up on the "big" mmorpgs, and am playing a small mmorpg where a
lot of the progress you make as character
goes through doing quests, and its closer to a real rpg (IMO) then the big
mmorpgs out there.

Im always kind of amazed it has so little people playing from newsgroups
like this one.
Makes you wonder if people here dont overrate pretty graphics.:P

I prefer gameplay, quests and a great community.
