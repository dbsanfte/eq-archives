Does anyone have an eqclient.ini file with a really good color scheme?  I've
tried changing mine around but I'm never satisfied with the results.  I'm
not really a user interface person so it seems that every time I make a
change I make things worse.  If you have a nice setup, please post your
eqclient.ini file.  Sorry, but I don't have email.

Thanks.
