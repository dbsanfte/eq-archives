Traveling through SG for anyone of a level to be hunting ANYTHING on the 
far side is pretty much trivial.  Yeah, if you're a level 52 warrior 
you're going to need a bit of help, but there's not a damn thing you can 
solo in ANY zone beyond that point.  It is certainly less of an impediment 
than Kael/SS are to 90% of the server who is KOS to one or the other.  
I've found that people who can't travel through SG lack the skills 
required to be much use on any high-end hunt, and having to CR them in SG 
after the raid is better than letting them cause a TPW.  
It's expected that you will die running through a couple times, but once 
you learn the trick (i.e. jboots/sow/run3 will let you run past the 
seahorses) it really is not difficult.  I don't know any druids who use 
the succor spell there anymore, it's a waste of time and mana.
